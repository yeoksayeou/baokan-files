### Minister Peng Discusses the Taiwan Incident, Explains the Current Military Situation in Various Regions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 12th. Minister Peng Xuepei answered reporters' questions as follows:

Question: What is the current situation in Taiwan? Can you give us details? Will Minister Bai Chongxi go to Taiwan?

Answer: In the past three days, Taiwan has quickly returned to calm. Things will be completely fine in a few days. The government is happy to implement any political and economic reforms in Taiwan, and it is also trying to be lenient in handling the incident. Chairman Chiang clearly declared on the 11th that our country is about to enter a constitutional era, and the ability of the people to be responsible and disciplined is a prerequisite for the success of democratic constitutionalism. Demands such as canceling the Taiwan Garrison Command, surrendering weapons, and having all of Taiwan's army and navy staffed by Taiwanese are obviously irresponsible and undisciplined actions. Seeking democratic constitutionalism in this way will not only be like climbing a tree to catch fish, but will inevitably lead to disaster. This is something we should all jointly admonish. Minister Bai will go to Taiwan in a few days to offer condolences and handle matters expediently.

Question: What is the current military situation?

Answer: (1) In the Northeast, the communist troops under Lin Biao are gathering around Tonghua and seem ready to move, but their units are complex and their ideology is divided, so their combat effectiveness is not strong. (2) In Hebei, the communist troops under Nie Rongzhen, after their disastrous defeat at Datong, were reorganized in the area around Yixian and Mancheng. They are now moving east near Dacheng, seemingly intending to take action to support Chen Yi, but their strength is insufficient to have any effect. (3) In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border area, the communist troops under Liu Bocheng suffered great losses on the Longhai Railway line and are now undergoing replenishment and training in Fanxian Yang. (4) In central Shandong, Chen Yi's troops are gathering in Mengyin, Xintai, Laiwu, Tai'an, and other places. The National Army is advancing rapidly southward and recovered Qufu, Fuyang, and other places on the 9th. Although the Chinese communists exaggerate the extent of their disruptive forces, among China's thirty-six provinces and regions, only about six or seven are experiencing actual military activity.

### Current Situation in Harbin is Bleak, Communist Army Scavenges Manpower

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] The situation in Harbin recently has been bleak, and commerce and industry are depressed. After the Spring Festival, the communist army rounded up wandering people to serve as laborers. Cloth prices are two or three times higher than in Shenyang.

### American Newspaper Criticizes the Soviet Union

### Minister Bai and Others to Fly to Taiwan Today

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] It is reported that Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense will change to flying to Taiwan on the 13th. Director Wu Shi, Director Jiang Jingguo, and Secretary Yang Shouqiong will accompany him.

### Central Standing Committee States Its Attitude Towards the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, Vice Minister Liu Says Our Internal Affairs Should Not Be Discussed by Other Countries

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] At the regular meeting of the Central Standing Committee on the 12th, after Minister Wang Shijie reported on the situation of the Moscow Conference, the committee members expressed their opinions and unanimously opposed any discussion of China's internal affairs at the Moscow Conference.

[Another Report] Regarding the reporter's question about "the Chinese government's attitude towards Molotov's suggestion to discuss the China issue at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference," Minister Peng Xuepei read the response from Deputy Minister Liu Kai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the press conference of the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 12th. The original text is as follows: Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already issued a statement yesterday explaining the Chinese government's attitude. What I can say is that the Chinese people have fought hard for more than eight years to win China's freedom and independence. They absolutely cannot accept the suggestion to provide their internal problems for discussion by other governments or to form an agreement by other governments, and of course, they will feel resentment. This suggestion will be regarded as infringing on China's sovereignty and China's status as a wartime ally, and this suggestion is contrary to the spirit and provisions of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that it shall not interfere in the internal affairs of member states. You may ask whether the participation of China can discuss the Chinese problem. I can emphatically answer that the participation of China and me will absolutely not affect China's view that the problem cannot be discussed.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 12th] Foreign Vice Minister Liu Kai today welcomed the US Secretary of State's opposition to the Soviet suggestion to include the China issue on the agenda of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, and said: This move is to fulfill the guarantee to the Chinese government.

### The United States, Britain, and France Unanimously Uphold Justice, Soviet Suggestion is Vetoed, Foreign Ministers Conference Does Not Discuss the China Issue

[United States Information Service, Moscow, 11th] At the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, after the French representative also opposed the Soviet proposal to include the China issue on the agenda, the British and American representatives agreed today to have an informal discussion on the Chinese situation with the Soviet Union outside the Foreign Ministers Conference. The second suggestion made by the Soviet Foreign Minister, namely that the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, in the capacity of the signatories of the December 1945 Moscow Declaration of Foreign Ministers, consider the Chinese situation outside the Foreign Ministers Conference and issue a communiqué, was also rejected.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] US Secretary of State Marshall felt somewhat relieved today, having obtained the assistance of British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault, and finally thwarted the Soviet motion to discuss the China issue. Under the joint pressure of the US, British, and French Foreign Ministers, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov withdrew the proposal.

### Marshall's Statement

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 11th] US Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement at the Foreign Ministers Conference on the 11th, the original text of which is as follows: "The Three-Power Declaration on China issued at the Moscow Conference in December 1945 was not a declaration of the Foreign Ministers Conference, but a declaration of the three Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. I believe that if matters related to China are included in the conference agenda, and China, as a member state of the conference, does not attend and participate in the decision on the agenda? and any subsequent discussions, it would be inappropriate. The Moscow Declaration is only a statement of the three countries' position on China, especially regarding the position of the two countries on their troops stationed in China. I am quite willing to exchange reports with Mr. Molotov and Mr. Bevin on the implementation of any clauses of the Moscow Declaration during my stay in Moscow, but not at the Foreign Ministers Conference."

[Another Dispatch] Marshall rejected the discussion of the China issue at the Foreign Ministers Conference without the participation of a Chinese representative at the meeting he chaired on the 11th. Bidault said that it would be unfair to discuss the China issue without China's participation. Molotov explained that since the conference did not agree to include this proposal on the agenda, he would not insist on it. Bevin stated that he could discuss this issue informally but was unwilling to participate in issuing a communiqué. Bevin frankly stated that he did not want to discuss the China issue without China's participation. Molotov did not express any opinion after Bevin spoke. Today's meeting continued for three hours and twenty minutes. The meeting on the 12th will begin at 4:00 PM.

Furthermore, the material preparations in Beijing in January determined the food needed for 100,000 civil servants, but the civil servants approved by the Executive Yuan numbered only 30,000 to 40,000, so the reserves are extremely sufficient.

According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, the Allied nations should hand over Dalian to the Central Government. Special Envoy Zhang Jianfei returned to Nanjing to report on this matter. He has also telegraphed Mayor Gong Xuesui to come to Shenyang as soon as possible. He also said that according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the National Army can be stationed in Dalian at any time.

[Our Nanjing Newspaper, 12th] Dong Yingbin, Chief of Staff of the Northeastern Headquarters, Xu Zhen, Chairman, and Zhang Jianfei, Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Northeast, and their entourage, after arriving in Nanjing, jointly visited Foreign Minister Wang at noon on the 12th and are scheduled to meet with Chairman Jiang Zhongzheng within days. Dong and others were summoned to Nanjing to seek instructions from the authorities on the takeover of Dalian and the removal of materials from the Northeast. According to sources, the takeover of Dalian is not far off.

Remarks by Xu Zhen:

Liaoning Province to Focus on Construction This Year

According to Xu Zhen, only the border areas of Liaoning Province are occasionally disturbed by the Communist army, but they are all repelled by the People's Self-Defense Forces in coordination with the National Army. The strength of the militia is strong, and public security can be guaranteed. The people's lives in the province are very stable. Last year, the central task of the province was to protect transportation lines and power lines, namely, to maintain the Fengman Hydropower Station. This year, the province will engage in construction and production work, developing water conservancy in the Liao River area, improving aquatic products, and increasing the production of cotton, soybeans, and apples. The province has well-developed railways, including the Shenhai, Bei Ning, Siping-Taonan, and Anfeng lines. Education is also very popular, with seventy-six public secondary schools, 410,000 primary school students, and over 40,000 secondary school students. There are also several universities, including Northeastern University, with an average of one student for every twenty-six people. If the water conservancy project can be completed as planned this year, it will increase the arable land by 4 million mu, and open up more than 600,000 mu of paddy fields, which can greatly supply the National Army stationed in the area with rice. As for local industrial and mining enterprises, they have not yet fully recovered. The province has now established a three-year plan to plant 500 million trees.

### Darkness Envelops Dalian: National Assembly Delegate Shao Shen Ting Imprisoned by Communist Army, Former Chamber of Commerce President "Liquidated" and Commits Suicide

[Our Shenyang Newspaper, 12th] Shao Shen Ting, a National Assembly delegate from Dalian, has been imprisoned by the Communist army, and his flour mill and property have been sealed off. Shao is 64 years old and owns more than a dozen Tian Yu Fu mechanized flour mills in Dalian and Harbin. According to people from Dalian, Zhang Benzheng, the former president of the Chamber of Commerce, 87 years old, committed suicide out of grief because many transport ships of his Zhengji Company were "liquidated." Many people mourned his death.

[Another dispatch] It is reported that the Beizhoushui Textile Factory in Dalian was occupied by the Communist army and converted into an arsenal, specializing in the production of hand grenades and Russian-style submachine guns.

### Key Points of the Gu Shouxun Verdict (Continued)

Rape: After the Japanese army captured the city, they went out and raped, indulging in lust. According to statistics from the International Committee composed of foreigners, on December 16th and 17th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), more than a thousand Chinese women were raped by the Japanese army, and the methods were bizarre and cruel, unprecedented in history. For example, on December 13th, Mrs. Tao Tang, residing at No. 5 Donghonghou Lane, Zhonghua Street, was raped by the Japanese army and then had her abdomen cut open and her body burned. Mrs. Xiao Yu, a pregnant woman of nine months, Huang Guiying, a 16-year-old girl, Chen Er Guniang, and a 63-year-old village woman were also brutally raped in the Zhonghua Gate area. In Duicaoxiang Lane, Zhonghua Gate, a young village girl, Ding Xiaoguniang, was raped by thirteen Japanese soldiers. Unable to endure the pain, she cried out for help and was stabbed to death in the lower abdomen. From December 13th to 17th, outside Zhonghua Gate, after raping women, the Japanese army forced passing couples to continue the rape. A monk who refused was castrated to death. Also, outside Tucheng Head, Zhonghua Gate, three young girls committed suicide by jumping into the river out of shame and anger after being raped by the Japanese army. All Chinese women remaining in Nanjing were in constant fear and fled to the safety zone designated by the International Committee. However, the Japanese army disregarded international justice and indulged their lust, sneaking in at night, groping and raping without regard for age. Although foreigners made serious protests to the Japanese military authorities in the name of international organizations, Japanese generals Gu Shouxun and others turned a blind eye and allowed their subordinates to continue their atrocities.

Burning: Furthermore, wherever the Japanese army went, burning and slaughter were often carried out simultaneously. Our capital was the target of their terror policies, so the intensity of the burning was unparalleled. At the beginning of the fall of the city, large fires raged everywhere from Zhonghua Gate to the lower Yangtze River, the flames soaring into the sky, and almost half of the city was reduced to ashes. The loss of our public and private property was incalculable. Dozens of houses in Xunzhang Lane, Zhonghua Gate, were burned down, and hundreds of residents, including He Guangsen, Xia Honggui, and Bi Zhangshi, were left homeless. Hundreds of houses belonging to residents You You Nian, Chang Xu Shi, Feng Zhaoying, and others in Zhonghua Gate, Diaoyu Lane, Hubei Road, Changle Road, and Shuangzha Town were also burned down and completely destroyed. On December 20th, a planned arson attack was launched throughout the city. The Taiping Road in the city center was engulfed in flames, which did not extinguish until night. Furthermore, all fire-fighting equipment was looted, and any citizen who dared to rescue was killed without mercy.

Looting: The Japanese army was also extremely greedy, looting all kinds of food, livestock, utensils, and antiques. For example, at No. 50 Shiba Street, they looted four large boxes of valuable books and more than 2,000 pieces of calligraphy, paintings, antiques, 400 pieces of furniture, and more than 30 boxes of clothes belonging to Shi Tiexuan of the National Bank. In Jiqing Road, Renguan Lane, and other places, they looted countless livestock, food, and money from the people. Even the belongings of nurses, the bedding of patients, and the food of refugees in the International Red Cross Hospital were looted. The residences of Douglas Jenkins, an official of the U.S. Embassy, Miss Gertrude Stable, an American missionary, and Germans Ula Biba, Chipahede Bo, and Puluo Zhengmmsheng were also searched and looted, resulting in enormous losses. Such atrocities are too numerous to count. After Japan surrendered, Gu Shouxun was arrested in Tokyo and escorted to Nanjing by our delegation to Japan. He was investigated and prosecuted by the prosecutors of this court. (Reasons omitted) (End)

Editorial

### The Establishment of the Economic General Staff

The Supreme Economic Council, entrusted with the mission of reviving China's post-war economic construction, was established on November 26, 1945. However, in the year that has passed, nothing in the country has returned to its normal state, and there is still a long and winding road ahead towards economic recovery. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan has not passed the council's organizational law. Moreover, its nature somewhat conflicts with the various competent departments. In today's situation, where the country is striving to tighten budgets and vigorously carry out streamlining, its necessity is also worth considering. However, in order to implement emergency economic measures, the government, at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 4th of this month, decided to change the Supreme Economic Council into the National Economic Council, changing its original mission and expanding its current responsibilities. The National Defense Supreme Council has already passed the draft organizational regulations of the council on the 6th, and it is now being sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. From the perspective of economics and world economic trends, a country's highest economic administrative organization should be its economic general staff, its position being important and its significance profound, requiring no further explanation. Whether the National Economic Council will assume this mission is a concern for the general public. Now, as the Legislative Yuan is meticulously studying the draft organizational regulations of the council and has not yet completed the third reading, we would like to express our views to provide reference:

1. Regarding the organization of the Economic Council: According to the regulations shown, the organization of the Supreme Economic Council consists of a chairman, concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan, a vice-chairman, concurrently held by the Vice-President, and the ministers of the economic, agricultural, forestry, and food departments as ex officio members. The National Government may also appoint five people as members. In addition, there are counselors, secretaries, and specialized members, who are divided into groups to handle various duties. When necessary, Chinese and foreign experts may be hired as consultants and advisors. According to the organizational regulations, the council seems to be entirely an administrative body, but the governing authority directly under the National Government, which holds the full administrative power, cannot interfere. Therefore, whether its system itself should be adopted requires careful consideration. This time, the reform changes the name to "National Economic Council," and the system is changed to be subordinate to the Executive Yuan, which seems more reasonable in terms of the system. Regarding personnel, in addition to increasing the chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission and the president of the Central Bank as ex officio members, there are another ten to twenty members appointed by the National Government, which seems to be intended to gather talent and pool wisdom. This is certainly a correct move in assisting the promotion of the Economic Council's work. However, whether this type of organizational form is equivalent to an economic general staff is open to question. Based on world experience and the lessons of past unreasonable organizational failures, for this institution, which is closely related to the economic lifeline of the people of the country, we should widely select representatives from the production and consumption sides, and representatives from private banks, companies, and enterprises to participate, and it should include economic experts and representatives of public opinion organs. This will enable us to synthesize opinions from all parties and achieve its assigned tasks.

2. Regarding the tasks of the Economic Council: According to the regulations, the tasks of the Supreme Economic Council are to complete economic recovery and improve the people's livelihood, to make full and effective use of the country's resources, to decide on major economic policies, to formulate major economic plans, and to coordinate the work of various economic departments. Its power is very strong. However, the reality shows that the domestic economic situation in recent years has not been entirely as we would like it to be. This time, the reform of the Supreme Economic Council should not only eliminate bureaucratic practices in organization and personnel, but also implement and complete democratic planned economy in its tasks. It is heard that the future National Economic Council will not only be responsible for the functions of the "Supreme Economic Council," but also preside over the "promotion of specific economic measures," such as price controls, import management, and export promotion. The "Organizational Regulations of the Price Commission of the National Economic Council" recently passed by the Executive Yuan is a large step in this direction. We believe that organizational regulations can be amended if necessary due to changes in circumstances. However, the tasks of the Economic Council should not be all-encompassing, and its functions should not be too cumbersome. At present, it should still focus on promoting emergency economic measures and stabilizing the people's livelihood. At the same time, the Economic Council should be a consultative and planning body, and its administrative affairs should still be executed by the competent ministries and commissions.

In short, implementing national economic policies at the present time is a complex undertaking. It is not possible to reverse the severe economic crisis without gathering wisdom and mobilizing the nation's intelligence. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee is about to convene, and will surely have discussions and resolutions on the current economic problems. Domestic economists and business people are concerned about current affairs and have valuable opinions. We hope that the government will broadly adopt public opinion after the Third Plenary Session to reverse our current economic crisis.

### 22nd Anniversary of the Death of the Founding Father of the Nation: Chairman Leads Central Committee Members to Pay Respects at the Mausoleum, All Circles in Peiping Hold Public Memorial Service at the Empty Grave

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The 12th was the 22nd anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father of the Nation. The Central Committee members staying in Nanjing went to the mausoleum of the Founding Father at 9:00 AM to pay their respects. A simple memorial ceremony was held, presided over by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and after Chiang offering flowers, and leading the members in paying respects at the mausoleum, the ceremony was completed. The Central Standing Committee had originally resolved not to hold a memorial service on the anniversary of the Founding Father's death. This is the first anniversary of the Founding Father's death since the return to the capital after victory, so a simple memorial service was specially held. In the future, memorials will no longer be held, in accordance with the resolution of the Central Standing Committee.

[Our Peiping Newspaper, 12th] After holding a memorial meeting for the 22nd anniversary of the death of the Founding Father of the Nation at Zhongshan Park in Peiping this morning, more than fifty representatives of various agencies took cars out of Xizhimen to Biyun Temple in the Western Hills to publicly mourn at the grave containing the Founding Father's clothing.

### Important News Briefs

This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch: Kirk arrived in Nanjing at 9:30 AM on the 13th. Gui Yongqing and others will be there to welcome him.

This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch: Huang Shaohong arrived in Suzhou with his family on the 11th, accompanied by Qian Dajun to tour scenic spots. Mr. Huang will go to Nanjing on the 13th to attend the Third Plenary Session.

This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch: The Suzhou High Procuratorate began prosecuting and issuing arrest warrants on the 12th for the puppet Wujin County Magistrate, Sun Shichao, and the puppet Special District Commissioner, Yan Gangru.

Letter to the Editor: To the Editor: Regarding the report in your March 11th edition from Hankou on the 10th about the incident involving the Zhongya transport ship, which attributed the responsibility for the incident to the seamen's discipline, claiming that a fire occurred in the ship's coal bunker, and that the Zhongya Company requested the union to replace the crew, but the union did not agree, resulting in leniency and ultimately leading to the disaster. The Zhongya transport ship was originally named Nanxiang and owned by the Nanxiang Company. The seamen serving on the ship were all former employees of Nanxiang. According to established practice, changes in ship ownership do not affect the personnel working on the ship. Our union, in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its members, should handle the matter accordingly. Furthermore, the ship has been operating well since its voyage, and the company has never requested the replacement of seamen due to poor discipline. As for the unfortunate incident involving the ship, the relevant authorities will surely investigate thoroughly, and it is unlikely that unsubstantiated responsibility will be placed on the seamen. We have always admired your newspaper's fair stance and truthful reporting, and we kindly request you to investigate and correct the report to set the record straight! Sincerely, The Chinese Seamen's Union, March 12th.

### Twenty-Seven Hoarders Uncovered in Xi'an, Large Quantities of Flour Confiscated, Provincial Government's Decisive Action Pleases the People

[This newspaper's Xi'an dispatch, 12th] Twenty-seven hoarders were found hoarding a batch of flour worth 140 million yuan, which was decisively confiscated by the Shaanxi Provincial Government and will be distributed to public educators and staff. The proceeds will be used to support social relief efforts. A large quantity of hoarded flour is also being sealed and audited, and some will certainly be confiscated. This is an example of the authorities acting decisively after obtaining clues from news reports following the promulgation of the economic emergency measures, which has greatly pleased the citizens. However, it seems no one can prove that the black market for gold is non-existent. The Xi'an gold market, which once controlled the entire speculative market in the Northwest and saw daily transactions of hundreds of thousands of taels, now sells very little to the Central Bank, which is quite intriguing. It is also rumored that the counties along the fortified line have banned the flow of gold to the Communist areas and are strictly cracking down on drug dealers who purchase gold through illegal channels.

### The U.S. Has a Major Determination to Help Free Nations Defend Against Foreign Aggression, Truman Clarifies Government's Stance in Joint Session of Congress Yesterday

Economic Aid Granted to Greece and Turkey

[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: President Truman is preparing to deliver a speech to Congress, the text of which has been pre-released to newspapers. The content is as follows:

"The seriousness of the current world situation has compelled me to attend a joint session of Congress. One of the issues I want to bring to your attention and decision is the issue of Greece and Turkey. The United States has just received an urgent request from the Greek government for economic assistance. The report from the American economic delegation currently in Greece, as well as the report from the American ambassador to Greece, confirms that this assistance is necessary if Greece is to remain a free country. I do not believe that the American people and Congress will turn a deaf ear to Greece's request. Greece is not a wealthy country. Due to a lack of natural resources, the Greek people have to work hard. Since 1940, this thrifty and peace-loving country has faced four years of internal and external troubles. When the liberation army entered Greece, they found that the retreating German army had destroyed all railways, roads, transportation vehicles, and merchant ships. Over a thousand villages were destroyed, 85% of the children suffered from tuberculosis, and almost all livestock and poultry disappeared. Inflation has declared the national economy bankrupt. This tragic situation is enough to create political chaos and make economic recovery impossible. Greece today lacks the funds to import necessities. Under these circumstances, the Greeks cannot solve their construction problems. Greece urgently needs financial assistance to continue purchasing food, clothing, fuel, seeds, etc., which are essential for the people's livelihood and can only be purchased from abroad. Greece must receive assistance to import materials necessary to restore domestic order and security. Currently, the survival of the Greek state is threatened by the activities of terrorists, with armed personnel led by the Communist Party rebelling against the government, especially in the northern border areas. A Security Council investigation team is currently on the ground investigating the turmoil in northern Greece. The Greek government is currently unable to cope with the situation. The Greek army is poorly equipped and understaffed. If the government wants to restore its authority within its territory, it must be equipped. If Greece is to be a self-respecting and self-sufficient democratic country, it must receive assistance from others. The United States must provide this assistance because Greece can no longer obtain assistance from other countries. Britain used to provide some assistance, but now, due to its own difficulties, it will discontinue this assistance from March 31st. We have considered how to encourage the United Nations to assist Greece, but due to the current urgency, it is feared that the United Nations will be unable to do much.

"Greece's neighbor, Turkey, also deserves our attention. In the eyes of freedom-loving people around the world, the future of Turkey as an independent country is no less important than the future of Greece. Today, the situation in Turkey is very different from that in Greece. Turkey has not experienced the disasters that Greece has encountered, and the United States and Britain provided Turkey with material assistance during the war, but Turkey still needs our assistance. Since the war, Turkey has sought economic assistance from the United States and Britain to achieve the modernization necessary to maintain its national integrity, which is absolutely necessary for maintaining order in the Middle East.

"The goal of American foreign policy is to create an environment in which we and the people of other countries can work together freely, without being threatened. Unfortunately, several countries in the world are being threatened by totalitarian countries. The United States has repeatedly protested against all threats in Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria in violation of the Yalta Agreement. Aiding free nations resisting external pressure must be the policy of the United States.

"If we fail to assist Greece at this critical juncture, both the West and the East will be significantly affected. Therefore, I request Congress to authorize $400 million in loans to Greece and Turkey, ending on June 30, 1948."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The United States Congress is now prepared to accept the recommendations that President Truman will outline tomorrow and support its policy, which is not only to assist Greece, but also to support democracy and curb communism in important regions around the world.

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Senator Vandenberg, the Republican leader on foreign policy, stated that the United States' intervention in the Greek situation to prevent the Communist Party from gaining control may trigger a reaction in which the United States aids other "friendly" countries, leading to a war between Soviet Communism and Western democracy, especially in China and Korea. Therefore, Vandenberg, like other senators, requested that when President Truman asks the joint session of Congress for assistance to Greece, he should also clarify the impact of intervening in the Greek situation on US-Soviet relations.

White House Physician Announces President Needs Rest

[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: Not long before Truman attended an extraordinary joint session of Congress at 1:00 PM today (Eastern Standard Time) to announce his plan to provide economic aid to Greece to curb Communist forces in Southern Europe, the White House announced that Truman's personal physician had instructed him to immediately put aside official duties and take a short rest. The White House stated that Truman would depart from Washington for a short stay in Key West, Florida, after delivering his speech to Congress. Mr. Truman's speech will last twenty minutes and is considered the most important announcement of the post-war US diplomatic government, which will be broadcast to the world by radio and television.

[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: White House physician, Dr. Grayting, stated that President Truman must take absolute rest, but denied that Mr. Truman's health was in any serious condition. He stated that Mr. Truman's health was good and he was radiant, but he was exhausted from his recent trip to Mexico, which had caused him to lose weight. Therefore, he urgently needed to rest in order to recover.

### Marshall Proposes Unifying the Economies of the German Occupation Zones, Heated Debate Between the U.S. and Soviet Union on the Issue of Destroying German War Capacity

[This Newspaper's Report] Moscow, 12th Broadcast: The Foreign Ministers' Conference held its third meeting today, with the US side proposing to unify the economies of the four occupation zones in Germany. British Foreign Secretary Bevin questioned Molotov extensively, accusing the Soviet Union of harboring Nazi war criminals. In retaliation, Bevin questioned Molotov at today's meeting about the truth of the Soviet Union's handling of German prisoners of war, with sharp and eloquent words.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 12th] The German economic unification plan proposed by Marshall at the Foreign Ministers' Conference is based on Byrnes' original proposal. According to Mr. Byrnes's proposal, six central agencies, including industry, finance, food, agriculture, foreign trade, and transportation, should be established under the guidance of the Allied Berlin Control Council, without interference from the local authorities in each occupation zone. However, the Soviet Union never accepted it. Marshall's proposal today is exactly the same as Byrnes's original proposal, except for a few additions. The Soviet Union stated that it was willing to accept the proposal to unify the entire German economy, but demanded that the authorities in each occupation zone have the right to control it. The US side believes that this would reduce the effect of unification.

[This Newspaper's Report] London, 12th Broadcast: The four foreign ministers met today at the Aviation Club to handle German and Austrian issues in groups. The German group, chaired by US State Department expert Murphy, simplified the German investigation report of the Allied Control Council, so that when the issue of eliminating Nazi forces and democratizing Germany is discussed in the afternoon, progress can be accelerated. The Austrian group, chaired by American Clark, reviewed the political difficulties in Austria.

### Soviet Union Suggests Four Points to Disarm Germany

[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] Molotov proposed the following points at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today to quickly complete the disarmament of Germany: (1) The Foreign Ministers' Conference should instruct the Berlin Allied Control Council to formulate a plan to eliminate Germany's war industry by July 1, 1947, which must be fully implemented by the end of 1948 at the latest. Special attention should be paid to the liquidation of German trust organizations, etc. (2) Destroy all German war materials and all land, sea, and air force facilities within German territory.

(4) Disband all non-German troops and concentration camps within Germany and repatriate these personnel to their home countries in accordance with previous resolutions of the Allied Control Council.

[United Press, Moscow, 12th] The United States is determined to strive for Soviet consent to the early unification of the German economy at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and warned the Soviet Union in an indirect way that if it does not agree, it will reduce the amount of German industrial equipment it receives as reparations. The trend of American policy was evident when the Foreign Ministers' Conference began to discuss the extremely complex German issue.

Large Discrepancies Between U.S. and Soviet Opinions

Differences of opinion between Eastern and Western countries were evident from the very beginning of the conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov immediately criticized the actions of the United States and Britain in the western occupation zones of Germany, stating that the disarmament of the German side and the destruction of its war potential - heavy industry - in those occupation zones were unsatisfactory. French Foreign Minister Bidault merely stated that his country was particularly concerned with ensuring that Germany would never have the power to act again. British Foreign Secretary Bevin believed that the disarmament work was progressing smoothly. US Secretary of State Marshall's remarks were the longest, stating that the report on disarmament submitted by the United Nations Control Council for Germany was satisfactory, but the destruction of Germany's heavy industrial war potential was not progressing well. However, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the dismantling of German heavy industrial equipment for reparations must be completed after the economies of the four occupation zones in Germany are unified. If the German economy is not unified, its industrial level will naturally need to be higher than when the economy is unified.

The Soviet Union Now Has Two Choices

The implication of Mr. Marshall's remarks seems to be to leave only two choices for Molotov, that is, to participate in some kind of economic system to balance the economies of the eastern and western zones of Germany, or else the United States and Britain are unwilling to dismantle most of the German factories to be used as reparations to the Soviet Union. To what extent the opinions of the two sides differ can be seen in the proposals submitted by Mr. Molotov and Mr. Marshall. Mr. Molotov's proposal called for the formulation of a special plan to quickly destroy war potential within a time limit. Mr. Marshall advocated recognizing that there had been "significant progress" in disarmament and completing the task along the established lines. Since the opinions of the two sides diverged, the Soviet proposal to include the thorny issue of China on the agenda of the conference was blocked by Mr. Marshall.

Bevin Drops a Diplomatic Bombshell

On the opening day of the conference, Mr. Marshall had suggested that the issue of troop limits in Europe be placed on the agenda. Molotov requested that a decision be postponed, and this suggestion is also still pending. When the conference intensely debated the issue of disarmament, Mr. Bevin dropped a diplomatic bombshell, saying that if the number of prisoners of war still being held outside Germany was known, "it might be worth a list." Questions about this matter had been raised many times before, but the Soviet side had never answered, and had never stated how many German prisoners of war there were in the Soviet Union. It is not yet known whether Mr. Bevin intends to pursue this question to the end.

### U.S. and France Exchange Views on the Ruhr Area Issue

[Reuters, Moscow, 12th] According to unofficial sources, Secretary of State Marshall exchanged views with French Foreign Minister Bidault today on the control of industry in the Ruhr area. Mr. Marshall stated that although Ruhr industry should be placed under international political control, ownership of these industries must belong to the Germans. It is believed here that Mr. Marshall's explanation only indicates that the position adopted by the United States on Ruhr industry has not changed, and that it still differs from the opinion of France. However, another view is that this statement may indicate that the United States is willing to seek a compromise to reconcile the previous American policy and the recent recommendations of the French government on the Ruhr. According to this view, the exchange of opinions was not on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### The Tripoli Issue Will Be Reopened

Britain Advocates for International Administration

### Britain Still Dissents on the Former Japanese Mandated Islands Issue

The British side stated that the principle of equal economic opportunity, which is stipulated in the United Nations strategic trusteeship agreement, must be strictly adhered to in all circumstances.

### U.S. Policy Toward Korea Will Be More Active Than Before

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Undersecretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the State Department is further exploring the situation in Korea in accordance with Marshall's instructions.

Some believe that this kind of speech is beneficial to the establishment of an independent six-government in southern Korea, and implies that the United States is considering establishing a "temporary independent government" in southern Korea.

### Tribal Riots in Punjab Province Continue, Conflict Erupts Again in Northwest Frontier Yesterday

### Egypt Plans to Abandon the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty

The relationship between Sudan and Egypt will be similar to the relationship between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Attlee Clarifies Britain's Policy Toward Egypt

[Reuters, London, 11th] Prime Minister Attlee told former Foreign Secretary Eden, a member of the opposition party, in the House of Commons today: The Egyptian Prime Minister previously made a statement regarding the breakdown of Anglo-Egyptian limb negotiations, pointing out that the reasons for the breakdown were that Egypt could not obtain satisfaction on the following two points: (1) The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt must be an unconditional, immediate, and complete withdrawal; (2) Maintain the unity of Egypt and Sudan and restore Egypt's administrative authority in Sudan to prepare for Sudan's autonomy. Regarding the first point, the British government has agreed in the agreement established by Bevin and former Egyptian Prime Minister Matki to withdraw all British troops stationed in Egypt by 1949. British troops had previously had significant responsibilities in Egypt, and now that they are withdrawing from the country, a considerable amount of time is needed, so the 1949 deadline is not excessive. Regarding the second point, the British Foreign Secretary has clearly stated that the British government supports the existence of an autonomous government in Sudan, and that when the time comes, the Sudanese people should have complete freedom of choice, either complete independence or merger with Egypt. The British government does not intend to separate Sudan from Egypt. However, the Sudanese people are not completely the same race, culture, or religion as the Egyptian people. The Sudanese people are made up of many races, with a total population of 7 million, and they are not Muslims or speak Arabic. Therefore, the Sudanese people's right to free choice is indeed necessary.

### Soviet Union Rejects British and American Suggestions to Investigate Hungarian Internal Affairs

U.S. to Take New Measures

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] Regarding the United States' note to the Soviet government last week protesting Soviet interference in Hungary's internal affairs, Undersecretary of State Acheson told reporters that the Soviet Union delivered a reply to the State Department yesterday refusing, so the United States will take new measures in the near future, but it is not convenient to announce in what way they will do so. The Soviet Union's reply stated: The Hungarian Soviet military authorities arrested Kovacs, the former Secretary-General of the Smallholders Party. Your country's proposal to investigate it jointly with Britain is an interference in Hungary's internal affairs. The arrest of Kovacs was essential to protect the Soviet occupation authorities in Hungary.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] Regarding Soviet interference in Hungary's internal affairs, the Foreign Office announced that the Soviet Union had refused Britain's request for the Soviet military authorities in Hungary to report the details of the arrest of Kovacs, the former Secretary-General of the Hungarian Smallholders Party. The content of the reply was completely the same as its reply to the American protest.

### Ambassador Zheng's Speech in Greater London: China's Contribution to the Great War - Direct and Indirect Efforts Led to Victory

[Central News Agency, London, 11th] Zheng Tianxi, China's Ambassador to the United Kingdom, stated in a speech at the "China and the Chinese Army" commemorative luncheon held at the Simpson Military Club in London today: China's direct and indirect contributions led the anti-aggression war towards victory. Today's luncheon was held by the Simpson Military Club to commemorate the Chinese army. Ambassador Zheng said, "You should know the contributions made by the British in enduring the insane aggression at the beginning of this great war." Zheng also stated that in addition to the huge sacrifices of human life in directly resisting aggression, indirect contributions to victory should also be commemorated, such as the construction of the Burma Road, which was a huge project comparable to the Suez Canal or the Great Wall of China. However, China is a peace-loving nation. China has fought wars with other countries, but China has never launched a war of aggression. Long before the birth of Caesar, Chinese sages had already rejected war with extremely clear words! Zheng stated: The sacrifices made by China and the Chinese people in this war have not only been recognized by the United Kingdom but have also been understood by all civilized countries. China's pioneering resistance to aggressor nations is China's glory. Zheng concluded, "We were allies in wartime, and we will always be brothers in peacetime. This friendship will not only benefit the future of China and the United Kingdom but will also benefit all mankind."

### Hundreds of Dependents of Taiwanese Civil Servants Arrive in Shanghai in Disarray Aboard the "Zhongxing" - Some Wounded and Penniless

After the "February 28th Incident" in Taipei, the "Zhongxing" ship, which had sailed from Shanghai to Taiwan, returned to Shanghai from Shantou yesterday at 6 p.m. and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Huangpu Wharf. The ship carried more than 1,000 passengers, of whom 300-400 boarded in Keelung, mostly dependents of civil servants in Taiwan Province, who were evacuated hastily during the chaotic period. According to the ship's captain, Chen Xiqiu, the passengers boarded in extremely disarray, with 30-40 of them suffering injuries and bleeding profusely, a tragic sight. Most of them were also disheveled and penniless and were taken care of properly on board. Mr. Chen also said: "The ship's important mission to Taiwan this time was to load 160 boxes of Taiwan Bank banknotes, totaling 900 million Taiwan dollars. On the 1st of this month, when it arrived off the Zhoushan Islands from Shanghai, it learned of the 'February 28th Incident' and anchored there for a day to observe the situation. Later, on the 3rd of this month, after learning that order had been restored in Taipei, it was ordered to continue sailing, but some 60-odd passengers decided to turn back, and the company sent a small steamer to Shanghai. It arrived in Keelung on the morning of the 5th. To prevent any accidents, it was only able to dock at 2 p.m. after negotiations. It stayed in Keelung for two hours, and 500-600 people disembarked, of whom more than 100 were 'mainlanders.' Several of them were beaten by Taiwanese people for wearing civil servant uniforms. Apart from the Taiwan Bank banknotes, which were safely unloaded under the protection of military police, no other goods were unloaded. A cook on the ship went ashore to buy groceries and was robbed, but he was not beaten." The ship sailed from Keelung to Shantou on the 6th. After hearing that order in Shantou was also becoming chaotic again, it did not pass Keelung on its return journey.

### Mayor Wu's Remarks After Returning to Shanghai: Prices of Public Utilities in the City Will Not Be Adjusted; Results of the Nanjing Price Conference Will Be Announced Soon; Secretary-General He Has Resigned, but Has Been Persuaded to Stay

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu, who attended the price conference in Nanjing, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. The reporter asked him extensive questions about the price issue and the personnel arrangements of the municipal government. The mayor did not give a clear answer to the results of the price conference, saying only that they would be announced after Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu left for Shanghai tomorrow and arrived here the day after (the 14th). He also said that the prices of public utilities in the city may not be adjusted to avoid stimulating commodity prices. If public utilities suffer losses, the government may still consider subsidizing them. The distribution of in-kind rations to public school teachers and civil servants has been postponed to the 20th of this month due to the fact that the lists have not yet been compiled.

Regarding the discussion on reducing the number of municipal government personnel, the mayor still said that there could be no changes. The Executive Yuan will express to the mayor that if there are any objections, they can be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The mayor said that he had invited city councilors to visit the various bureaus of the municipal government to understand that the current number of personnel in the municipal government was not excessive. He decided to submit a report to the Executive Yuan after receiving the written opinions of the City Council.

When asked whether the mayor would be promoted to the new position of Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, the mayor said: The situation in Shanghai is complex. He is tired and hopes to leave his post, but so far, the central government has not made such an appointment. He also said that Secretary-General He Dekui's resignation has been retained, and the heads of all bureaus have also expressed their intention to resign, and they have all been persuaded to stay. He also did not agree to the internal transfer of the heads of the financial bureaus, because Shanghai's tax revenue is complicated, and the heads of the financial bureaus have been dealing with it for more than a year, and they are familiar with everything, so it is better not to transfer them. However, the central government needs talent urgently and insists on the transfer, so he could not force them to stay. However, he has requested the central government to wait until the heads of the bureaus have completed the issue of the old Shanghai Municipal Council employees' retirement funds before taking up their new positions. Also, because the issue of the old Shanghai Municipal Council employees' retirement funds is difficult to resolve, Mayor Wu has asked the central government's Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send personnel to Shanghai to discuss and resolve it together.

Chang was wearing an old dark gray silk-faced camel hair robe, a small black velvet hat, blue silk leggings, and black cotton shoes. He was fat, and two bailiffs held him as they walked to the public case prepared in advance. Knowing that his death was near, his face suddenly turned pale. He stated: He was 63 years old, from Jiangling, Hubei, and lived at Fuzimiao, Nanjing. The prosecutor handed the Supreme Court's verdict to Chang to read, and instructed him, "The order has been given to execute you today. Do you have any last words?" Chang replied, "My family has not come, I have nothing to say," and muttered to himself, "I still want to appeal." At this time, Chang's mind was in a state of confusion. He was then ordered to put his handprint on the document, put on handcuffs, and escorted by bailiffs to the new execution ground behind the police hospital. Bailiff Weng Yunquan shot Chang in the back of the head, and the bullet exited through his right cheek. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely, and died instantly. The time was exactly 12:00 noon.

At 4 p.m., the District Prosecutor's Office sent prosecutors to examine the body. Chang Yuqing's younger brother, Chang Yuting, who lived at 14 Taicheng Lane, Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu, did not know the news of his brother's death and came to visit him in prison. The District Prosecutor's Office prosecutors handed over Chang's body to Chang Yuting to claim. Later, a hearse from the Shangtian Funeral Parlor was sent to the autopsy office on Hede Road for examination, and then transported to the funeral parlor for burial. This murdering demon who relied on the power of the enemy has passed away.

Chang was formerly the owner of the Daguan Garden Bathhouse in this city. When the January 28th Incident occurred, he colluded with Hu Lifu and others to become a traitor. Later, Hu was arrested and executed, but Chang escaped and disappeared for a long time. It was once heard that he was in the Northeast. After the August 13th Incident, he reappeared and became the leader of the "Huangdao Association." Many people were sacrificed under his control. Today, he was executed according to law, which was welcomed by all who heard about it. (The above picture shows the identification of the body before the execution, and the picture below shows the body after the execution. Photographed by this newspaper)

For thirty years, he has cultivated talent and benefited those who came after him. Through deep thought and diligent study, he has created a forest of famous works. His scripts for spoken dramas, Peking operas, and local operas, as well as poems, prose, lyrics, songs, and films, have spread far and wide, recited by the masses. During the War of Resistance, he initiated performances in vehicles and in rural areas, serving the sacred war effort and earning well-deserved merit. The twentieth day of the second lunar month (corresponding to March 12th of the Gregorian calendar this year) is Mr. Tian's fiftieth birthday. We, his colleagues, whether long-time friends or humble students, deeply feel that Mr. Tian's presence in our country's art world is truly a blessing for our culture and a beacon for our nation. Therefore, we have chosen to hold a celebration at the Ningbo Association Hall on Xizang Road at 2 PM the day after tomorrow to express our congratulations."

### Speculation and Manipulation Disrupt Finance: After the Promulgation of the Economic Emergency Plan, the First "Foreign Tiger" to Violate the Ban is Prosecuted

[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Foreign Tiger" case, after being transferred from the Garrison Headquarters to the District Prosecutor's Office at 7 PM on the 8th, has been prosecuted by Prosecutor Quan Tao after 77 hours of rigorous investigation yesterday. The main points of the indictment are as follows: The defendant, Masper, is the manager of both the New Asia and Alpes companies, engaging in the business of buying and selling foreign currencies such as US dollars. After the government promulgated the Economic Emergency Measures Plan on the 27th of this year, he continued to engage in buying and selling activities. This has been admitted by the defendant and is supported by seized account books and vouchers. The defendant has tried to evade and conceal the nature of New Asia and Alpes companies and his personal position in the two companies. However, during the court hearing on the 8th of this month, he disclosed that New Asia and Alpes companies are limited liability companies registered in the United States, and are essentially banking organizations. He also admitted to being the manager of both companies when questioned by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters during the case investigation. As for the defendant's buying and selling of US dollars and other foreign currencies, and his role in determining prices, in addition to the testimony of Bolivia, an employee of both companies, at the Garrison Headquarters, the defendant also admitted that after February 17th, "remittances were based on market prices," and "market prices were the prices at which buyers and sellers were willing to transact." When questioned about the prices at which he bought and sold US dollars during the initial interrogation, he stated: "The highest buying price was 14,700 yuan in legal tender, and the lowest was over 12,000 yuan. The highest selling price was 15,000 yuan, and the lowest was also above 12,000 yuan." It is clear that he was buying and selling foreign currencies such as US dollars without adhering to the prices stipulated by the government. Furthermore, based on various pieces of evidence, the thirteenth book in the seized evidence register compiled by the Garrison Headquarters, from page 43 to page 57, contains records of each transaction in which he bought and sold foreign currencies at black market prices. The twelfth and thirteenth books also record that after the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, he bought and sold large amounts of foreign currencies with cash or telegraphic transfers. The nineteenth item is a collection of original vouchers seized on the spot, documenting the defendant's determination of black market prices for foreign currencies. In addition, a large amount of illicit funds, including US$345,310 and Hong Kong dollars, were also seized on the spot. This sufficiently proves that the defendant's crime is indeed a fact. It is believed that the defendant used the substantial funds of New Asia and Alpes companies to set black market prices, buy and sell foreign currencies, engage in speculation and manipulation, and disrupt finance, which is a serious offense. It constitutes a violation of Article 7 of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency, and is therefore being publicly prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

It is understood that "Foreign Tiger" is the first case of a person being arrested by the authorities and prosecuted by the court for engaging in black market trading in violation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan after its promulgation.

### A Tragic Incident: Son Slashed with a Knife, Father Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Huanbin, a 44-year-old Shandong native residing at No. 4445 Yuqing Lane, Changshou Road, Shanghai West, for unknown reasons, used a kitchen knife to slash his son, Songquan (22 years old), injuring his forehead, the top of his head, and both hands at around 4:20 AM yesterday. Songquan, wounded, ran to the Putuo Road Police Station to report the incident. Officer Guan Zhaoyi rushed to investigate, only to find that Zhao Huanbin had tightly closed the door and refused to respond to knocking. He then, together with the sub-landlord Wu Yingzhou, opened the door and found Zhao had cut his neck with scissors and injured his skull, his breath weak. Both father and son were sent to the hospital for treatment. According to Wu Yingzhou, Zhao Huanbin and his wife, Zhao Zhang, often argued. Last month, Zhang, unable to bear the disturbances, angrily left and went to her daughter's place in Qingdao. Only the father and son were left in Shanghai. Recently, Zhao Huanbin and his son had frequent conflicts. It was apparent that the father seemed to be suffering from a mental illness, leading to this tragedy. It is reported that the injuries of both father and son are severe, and as of midnight yesterday, they were still in critical condition.

### Truck Auction: Eating the Debt, Enemy Property Clearance Office's Appeal to the High Court Still Rejected

[Our Newspaper's Report] Last June, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau entrusted the Jianghai Customs with the twenty-fifth auction of eight cargo trucks. Among them, six trucks were won by the Da Hu Transportation Company at a bid of 11,710,000 yuan. The manager of the company, Yuan Lianqi, paid 6 million yuan in cash and three crossed checks from the Daya Bank with a date of June 26, totaling 5,710,000 yuan. The remaining two trucks were won by Zheng Liangcai of the Gongji Company at a bid of 7,050,000 yuan. 3,050,000 yuan was also paid with a Daya Bank check dated June 27. Unexpectedly, the Daya Bank suspended check clearing from the 28th and declared liquidation on the 29th, causing the Bureau's check payments to be uncashed. The legal representative of the Bureau, Liu Gongyun, sued the Da Hu and Gongji companies in the civil division of the district court, requesting a judgment ordering them to repay the check amounts, but the judgment was rejected. Liu Gongyun disagreed and appealed to the High Court in his capacity as the legal representative of the Clearance Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau of the China Trust Bureau. The second instance of the case was announced yesterday. It was held that the drawer of the check was the Shanghai Daya Bank, and the check was personally signed by the bank's vice president. According to the provisions of Article 2 of the Check Law, the Daya Bank should be responsible, and the appellee has no debt liability. Therefore, the appeal was rejected, and the costs of the second instance shall be borne by the appellant.

### Accused of Conspiracy: Prosecution of Plainclothes Police Officer Wang Xiaoyun for Corruption, Huang Yubang, etc. is not a False Accusation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Prosecutor's Office received the case of Wang Bin, Huang Yubang, and Wang Weihou's false accusation against Wang Xiaoyun, a plainclothes police officer of the Penglai Branch, from the police bureau on February 19th. Prosecutor Wu Qihua conducted an investigation and detained the three suspects. The investigation has now concluded. The prosecutor found that Huang Yubang and others were not falsely accusing, and Wang Xiaoyun was indeed suspected of corruption and dereliction of duty. Therefore, Wang has been prosecuted. Wang Weihou and Huang Yubang used to engage in theft and paid protection money to Wang. Later, they were sentenced to imprisonment by the criminal division of the district court. After being released from prison, they reformed themselves, and their "tribute" to Wang was also interrupted. Wang then detained the thief Hu Zhifang at No. 242 Fumin Road, a teahouse opened by Wang, on February 5th, and ordered Hu to identify Huang Yubang and Wang Weihou as accomplices in theft, and detained the two. He secretly ordered Wang Bin (Wang's informer) to detain the two, but invited them to the teahouse that night to negotiate, extorting 300,000 yuan. Afterwards, Huang Wangbang and Wang Weihou reported the incident to the Inspectorate of the Police Bureau. The police bureau's investigation concluded that the accusations were unsubstantiated and suspected of false accusation, and transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The prosecutor summoned Hu Zhifang (who was in custody for another crime) and conducted investigations from various aspects, concluding that Wang was indeed suspected of corruption, and Huang Yubang, Wang Weihou, and Wang Bin were innocent.

Letter Received: Having read your newspaper's publication of the news "Arrangement of the Execution Ground for the Execution of the Death Sentence for the Convicted Chang Banqing," which stated that "the Chief Prosecutor of this Court indicated that the order to execute Chang could be issued tonight," this is inconsistent with the facts. The Chief Prosecutor of this Court has not met with reporters recently, and the execution order for Chang was only received at 9 AM today. In fact, it was not possible to express that yesterday. Furthermore, the execution of the death sentence must be kept secret beforehand, and there is no way to announce it beforehand. Please investigate and correct this. Sincerely, Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office Secretariat.

### Qingxia Relief Fund for Orphans, Widows, the Poor, and the Sick: Ninth Approved Application for Nine People (Continued)

(7) Cai Dexin wrote: "Having read in the newspaper that your organization has the Qingxia Relief Fund, which specializes in relieving orphans, widows, and helpless compatriots who are unable to make a living or who are poor and sick and unable to seek medical treatment, I am 51 years old. I served in the rear during the war and, when my hometown was invaded, I returned to Shanghai to search for my wife but was unable to find her, leading to the experience of unbearable separation.

### Inspecting Ships, Dividing Responsibilities, Setting Up Lifeboats at Wusong Port: Harbor Management Resolutions

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Harbor Management Committee held its 22nd meeting yesterday. When discussing the issue of reorganizing warehouses throughout the city, the Warehouse and Wharf Group put forward four points: (1) The congestion of goods in the Mai Gen Road General Warehouse is noteworthy. (2) The large amount of enemy and puppet grass ropes and grass bags stored in the No. 9 Wharf Warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau are actually useless and occupy warehouse space. (3) It seems inappropriate for a certain division to occupy the No. 9 Wharf Warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau. (4) There is an uneven distribution of cargo stacking among warehouses.

Furthermore, there are as many as eight units inspecting ships from military and police agencies, which is cumbersome and difficult to manage. It was resolved that customs will uniformly check tax matters, and the police bureau will convene relevant units to discuss inspection methods for public security matters, to be submitted to the next meeting for discussion.

At the same time, it was also decided to set up one or two lifeboats at Wusong Port, and it is proposed to ask the Executive Headquarters to find a way to allocate them. The seaport quarantine station will be responsible for rescue affairs. Before the equipment is perfect, the quarantine speedboat will temporarily take on the task.

### World Languages: English Most Prevalent, Chinese Second, American Experts Advocate Spelling Reform

[United Press International, Washington, 11th] The World Linguistics Society recently published a report advocating "One World, One Language" ideology. If everyone learned the same language, everything would be simplified. English is the most prevalent language in the world, with over 400 million speakers scattered across the globe. The second most prevalent is Mandarin Chinese, spoken by 200 million people. Although English is very common, it is not a unified world language. It is difficult for foreigners to learn English, and even native speakers find mastering the spelling requires years of hard work. The society's president, Owen, advocates adopting a new alphabet, personally creating a universally applicable alphabet of 37 letters, representing every sound in any language. Each letter represents one sound, so with this alphabet, English could be learned in a matter of months. Phonetics expert Laubach, however, has a different opinion, advocating retaining the original 26 letters and simply reforming the spelling. Other languages can do this, so why can't English? About 20% of English words in the dictionary should be modified so that their spelling and pronunciation are completely the same. For example, "Though," "Tough," "Cough," "Plough," and "Through" should be respelled as "Thoa," "Tuf," "Kawfi," "Plow," and "Throo." This way it would be "eeze enuf for anibodi" (easy enough for anybody).

### Operating Expenses of Private Schools Should Not Rely on Tuition Income, Executive Yuan Orders City Government to Notify

[Our Newspaper Report] The Municipal Government recently received an instruction from the Executive Yuan (Jiu Zi No. 6123) stating: "A letter from the Civil Service Office of the National Government, regarding the submission of a petition from 109 private secondary schools in Shanghai received by Committee Member Niu Yong-jian during his visit to Shanghai. As the Shanghai Municipal Council has been formally established, point 5 of the original petition need not be addressed. The remaining points have been instructed to be reviewed by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry's response is as follows: "Each section of the original petition has been reviewed as follows: (1) Regarding the request for government grants to private schools, the Ministry has long attached importance to assisting private schools and has implemented it in practice over the years. This year, with the restoration of schools, all provinces and cities have been instructed to allocate funds from the provincial and municipal education restoration funds to subsidize private schools to facilitate their restoration. (2) Regarding the request for an increase in private school tuition fees, private school tuition fees are appropriately increased each year according to price levels. However, according to regulations, the operating expenses of private schools should be covered by interest from the school's assets and funds or raised by the board of directors, and should not rely on tuition income. (3) The so-called formulation of laws and regulations to protect school buildings involves school rights and is not something that the Ministry can handle. (4) Regarding the request to reward principals and teachers at all levels who complied with laws and regulations and stood their ground during the war, each school should submit a special report for review," etc. Article 100 of the Land Law stipulates that the lessor may not take back the house unless one of the following circumstances exists, and Article 97 of the same law also imposes restrictions. If landlords of private primary and secondary schools in Shanghai take back school buildings on the pretext of doing so, or demand exorbitant rents, and a dispute arises, they can be handled in accordance with Article 101 of the Land Law. The Ministry of Education's proposals (1), (2), and (4) should be approved and implemented. In addition to notifying the Ministry of Education, the Municipal Government is hereby ordered to forward this notice to all private primary and secondary schools in the city for their information."

### Public Disclosure of Private School Finances, Teachers Investigated Accounts, Principal Used Violence

Faculty and Staff File Lawsuit with District Court

[Our Newspaper Report] Lu Tie-min, the principal of Tiehua Private Primary and Secondary School at No. 120 Julu Road, this city, has recently been sued by the Faculty and Staff Association in the District Court. Xue Yu-shan, a member of the school's Economic Audit Committee, and other members went to the principal's office to check the accounts and discovered that Principal Lu Tie-min was suspected of embezzling 3 million in deposits. When they confronted him, the principal and his wife initially prevaricated, and then resorted to violence, causing injuries. At the same time, they falsely accused them of theft. Xue Yu-shan was abruptly dismissed on the same day, and the dismissal letter stated: "Mr. Xue has expressed dissatisfaction with the school's administrative facilities and seems difficult to cooperate with in harmony. Moreover, today's uncivilized behavior makes it even more difficult to retain him." The Faculty and Staff Association of the school believes that the organization of an audit committee to check the school's finances publicly was originally mandated by the Education Bureau. The fact that violence was used because of this is obviously illegal. Therefore, in addition to filing a lawsuit with the District Court, they have also reported the situation to the City Education Bureau for investigation.

The first game is between the Faculty of Law and Tongde in the College Group. The strength of both sides is similar, and it is difficult to predict the winner once they meet.

Daxia lacks connection, and Yuehan is expected to win over Daxia. The last game is between Daxia and Aurora in the University Group.

### Mayor's Cup Football Preliminary Replay, Qingbai Eliminated Railway Yesterday, Two to Zero, One Goal in Each Half, Qingbai's Defense Line is Strong and Impenetrable

In the Mayor's Cup football preliminary replay, Qingbai and Railway fought at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. The audience was not as large as expected, totaling more than 2,000 people. The leaders of both teams, Wang Xin-heng of Qingbai and Wang Zhao-huai of Railway, personally came to the stadium to supervise the battle. As a result of the competition, Qingbai relied on the efforts of all three armies, scoring one goal in each half, eliminating Railway with a score of two to zero.

Gu Yisa Opened the Record

The referee was temporarily changed to Le Xiu-rong, with Huang Ren-yi and Wang Chong-ye as assistant referees. The game started at 3:30 PM. Qingbai took the initiative to attack. In less than two minutes, Li Yi-chen headed the ball in front of the Railway goal, and Liao Xiong left his post without authorization. Fortunately, Le Ren-xiao cleared the danger with a big kick. Qingbai continued to attack relentlessly, and the Railway goal was in constant danger. Jiang Wen-qing shot from the right corner, but failed. Lazy Niu cut in again, but was saved by Liao Xiong into a corner kick. At the 12th minute, Xiao Zi-wen took a free kick from 15 yards in front of the Qingbai goal, which was tricky and fast, but was saved by Qin Bi-gao. At the 26th minute, Mei Jian-qing's corner kick was headed by Li Yi-chen, but it was ruled invalid due to a collision foul with Liao Xiong. Eight minutes before the end of the first half, Qingbai attacked again. Li Yi-chen shot again, and Liao Xiong missed. Gu Yisa rushed to the scene and touched the ball into the net, opening the record with a score of one to zero. Although Railway tried to counterattack, the first half had already ended.

Li Yi-chen Scored Another Goal

After the break, the two sides fought again. Qingbai's original lineup remained unchanged, while Lu Bing-sheng retired from Railway and Fei Chun-lin took the field. Railway attacked, but Yan Shi-xin was stationed in the back, as solid as a rock. Meng Yi-liang and Qu Yong-fu assisted in the defense, and Railway had no chance to take advantage. In the chaotic battle until the 28th minute, Jiang Wen-qing took a corner kick, which landed in a great spot. Li Yi-chen took the opportunity to attack, shooting into the net from five yards away, giving Qingbai another victory with a score of two to zero. Railway worked together to counterattack, and Xiao Zi-wen and Wu Bing-hao had many opportunities to attack, but they were all saved by Yan Shi-xin and Wu Jia-lu one by one. Ten minutes before the end, Xiao Zi-wen lobbed the ball, and Lu Qing-xiang headed it in, but it was again saved by Qin Bi-gao into a corner kick. Before long, the final whistle sounded, and Railway was eliminated by Qingbai with a score of 0-2. The lineups of both sides yesterday are as follows.

Qingbai

Qin Bi-gao, Yan Shi-xin, Wu Jia-lu, Qu Yong-fu, Meng Yi-liang, Xue Pei-ran, Zhang Shi-yi, Luo Shou-fu, Li Yi-chen, Gu Yisa, Jiang Wen-qing

In the mixed doubles (1), An Wei and Mrs. Qu Luola won against Zeng Hongran and Miss Ye Jingxiong two to zero. (2) Hong Dequan and Miss Zhang Meili won against Ivanoff and Mrs. Fu Mixigen two to zero.

Mixed Doubles

(1) In the mixed doubles match between An Wei and Mrs. Qu Luola versus Zeng Hongran and Miss Ye Jingxiong, An and Qu had closer teamwork, so they led in points. They won the first game fifteen to ten. In the second game, after An and others scored eight points, Zeng and Ye began to chase quickly, scoring six consecutive points. An and Qu also did not relax and won again fifteen to eight.

An Wei Qu Luola (fifteen to ten fifteen to eight) Zeng Hongran Ye Jingxiong

(2) In the match between Hong Dequan and Miss Zhang Meili versus Ivanoff and Mrs. Fu Zhuxigen, Hong and Zhang had a strong momentum and often gained the upper hand. Mrs. Fu's golden hair, red vest, and fit figure concentrated the audience's attention. Hong and Zhang won the first game fifteen to three.

In the second game, they were evenly matched at the beginning. After each scoring two, they were neck and neck. Hong's smashes were quite fierce, and Ivanoff retaliated in kind. In the end, Hong and Zhang still won fifteen to four.

Donghua Arranges Lineup to Clearly Battle British Navy

The British Pacific Fleet's Bellfirth, Guardian, Comet, Kirk, and other four warships, after arriving in Shanghai last week, in order to foster friendship between China and Britain, will form a soccer team composed of mixed teams tomorrow at 4 PM to challenge the reigning champion of this year's league, Donghua Team, in a friendly match at Yiyuan Stadium. This friendly match is sponsored by the Physical Education Association's Soccer Committee. To limit the audience, tickets are sold in two denominations: three thousand and five thousand. The referee has also been arranged, with Shen Huichun, who has been resting for a long time, officiating, and He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang as linesmen.

The starting lineup for both sides will be announced today. Because Li Yao is in Shanghai, he may be able to return in time, but it is still under consideration. The British Navy mixed team held selections at the Russian Emigrant Sports Association yesterday. When the Chinese and British athletes compete, the excitement will be obvious.

### Primary School Physical Education Teachers' Association Orders Early Exercise Teaching Materials for Primary Schools

The city's primary school physical education teachers' association for liaison and advanced studies held its third board of directors and supervisors meeting yesterday at the city gymnasium. Board members and supervisors Yao Minghua, Jiang Ronghua, Zhang Yin, Jiang Xinping, Zhang Yundao, Zhu Bingkang, and others attended. It was decided that a equipment research class will be established first on the afternoon of March 24. Registration locations are Zou Yinlu at He'an Primary School, Zhang Yin (Jiang Ronghua at the Tenth District, Second Center, in the Shanghai West District).

### Exciting First Division Basketball Match: Shantou Team Meets Chunmao Tonight, Renyu Faces Navy Youth, There Will Be a Fierce Battle

The third act of the First Division Basketball League will continue at the City Gymnasium starting at 6 PM tonight. There will be two First Division matches, both with tense and exciting scenes. At 6 PM, Shantou Team will play Chunmao, and the outcome will affect the championship. At 8 PM, Renyu will play Navy Youth, which will be a battle for ranking. Tickets are still sold for two thousand and three thousand. The order of matches is as follows:

Shantou Team - Chunmao (First Division) 6 PM

Jiashen - Railway Shanghai (Second Division) 7 PM

Renyu - Navy Youth (First Division) 8 PM

The opening act of Shantou Team versus Chunmao is quite relevant to the First Division championship. Chunmao has six wins and three losses, so they have no hope of winning the championship, but Shantou Team has won every match and their calls for the championship are very high. They attach great importance to this battle. Ma Canxi and Cai Yanxiong are resourceful and will definitely have brilliant plans to secure victory, while Chen Qingjiang, He Lide, and Lin Weicong's aggressiveness is secondary. Chunmao once had a surprise upset, defeating the Hua Lianmeng champion, so they are not an "easy to deal with" team either, but whether the main player Liu Fushan can play due to injury is still a question.

The second match is between Jiashen and Railway Shanghai in the Second Division, and the outcome is not important. The final match is between Renyu and Navy Youth in the First Division. After the foreign troops were poisoned by Encas the other day, their future is bleak. Today is Renyu's last battle in this group, and they should be able to display their excellent basketball skills and have a good fight with the foreign troops.

### Talking About Participating in the World Games

— Wu Bangwei

There should be no problem for our country to participate in the 14th World Games to be held in England next year. The China National Sports Advancement Association is also preparing, and as long as the funding is available, everything will proceed smoothly. What the author wants to propose for discussion is not the question of participation, but how to determine our purpose and therefore plan an appropriate method to ensure that this participation in the World Games will indeed have some benefit for our country's present and future.

Since we estimate our strength and it is difficult to have a chance of winning in the World Games, and we clearly know that the ultimate goal of the World Games is not the gain or loss of trophies, we should assume another purpose for participating in this World Games.

I remember ten years ago when I went to Berlin to participate in the 11th World Games, we passed through various European countries, and everyone thought we were Japanese. When we explained that we were Chinese, they were very surprised and greatly interested. From this experience, it can be seen that we are too isolated from European countries. After this victory, we should take advantage of the deep impression of China in their minds and the hope to further know everything about China and the Chinese people, to give them a satisfactory promotion, so as to enhance friendship and understanding between each other. Regarding this level, it seems far from sports, but it is clear to everyone, so let's leave it aside for now.

The China National Sports Advancement Association has discussed the issue of inviting the World Games to be held in China in 1956. We do have the qualification and need to issue this invitation because we are one of the world's four great powers. I think the World Games Committee will definitely be happy to accept this invitation. The problem is that we really know too little about the holding of the World Games. For example, in the few sports we are familiar with, such as track and field, swimming, soccer, basketball, etc., we may still be able to handle them well, but what about the other sports? Many have only heard of them, but have never seen them. Many have seen them, but do not know the details. Under these circumstances, if the World Games were really held in China, how would we handle it?

Therefore, our participation in this World Games is not aimed at trophies, but to use this opportunity to enhance international relations, and at the same time to learn the organization and methods of various activities of the World Games, to prepare for us to host the 16th World Games. Based on this purpose, this view, I think the delegation we send to the World Games must have many personnel, a complete lineup, and definitely not like the 10th World Games, with one athlete and a few staff members holding the national flag to decorate the facade, nor like the 11th World Games, participating in seven or eight sports and neglecting others.

Many people, from another point of view, agree to only send soccer and basketball teams and a few qualified track and field athletes to participate, of course, there are sufficient reasons. However, for the aforementioned purpose, I agree with universal dispatch. In addition to soccer, basketball, and track and field, it is not that we have no talent to choose, but we do not pay much attention to other sports, rarely promote them, and there are even fewer opportunities for competition, so these talents are buried and unheard of. According to my inference, when these talents attend the competition, their results may not be proportionally worse than the results of soccer, basketball, and track and field athletes compared to foreigners. In the past, we always selected athletes from schools or narrow sports circles. In fact, we can find sharpshooters from the military and police, weightlifting champions from farmers and workers, good boxing and wrestling materials from the national martial arts community, and talents with various different skills from other special environments. We should widely solicit, train, and make most or all sports in the World Games have a few athletes participating. Only then can we know everything about the World Games and step into every international competitive sports organization. If we always stick to the same old ways and stick to a few common sports in the country, we will forever be isolated from the vast scope of international sports.

In addition to dispatching athletes, we must also pay attention to the selection of instructors. Those who serve as instructors must have a considerable foundation in knowledge and skills for the sport they are in charge of. In addition to leading and instructing athletes to participate in various competitions, so that athletes can gain practical experience and knowledge from the competitions, they should also investigate the methods of construction equipment, organizational management techniques of this sport, and contact and ask the key personnel of various international competitive sports organizations more, so that they can lead this sport after returning to the country and make it develop in the country. If the World Games are invited to China, they will be the cadres who cooperate with the technical personnel of various international competitive sports organizations.

As for the selection of athletes, whether it is through the opportunity of the National Games or holding a separate preliminary meeting, both are possible, and it is better to implement both concurrently, because many sports may not be included in the National Games. However, the selection committee must immediately formulate a method and entrust various local sports fields, sports organizations, schools, military and police agencies, troops, or individuals to find the talents we need and train them well. A considerable period of time before the registration deadline for the World Games, make a final selection based on each person's skills. Whether this selection needs standards is a matter of opinion, and everyone has different opinions, which is up to the person in charge to decide. My humble opinion is to provide it for the reference of the officials in charge of participating in the World Games.

### Issue of Purchasing Export Chinese Tea: A Solution Was Reached Yesterday

Still purchase at the original price, but the China Trust Bureau will provide a packing loan of 120%.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The purchase of export Chinese tea for the 35th year has been negotiated by tea merchants and the authorities several times, but no result has been obtained. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, negotiations reopened in the president's office of the Central Bank. Those present included Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Shao Zenghua and Li Xiaozhuang, Deputy Directors of the Business Bureau, Shen Xirui of the Central Trust Bureau, Wang Botian and Zhou Jiyao of the Farmers Bank of China, Shou Jingwei of the Tea Association, Sun Xiaochun and Ye Shichang of the Tea Export Industry Association, Wu Juenong of the Southeast Region Tea Field Joint Association, Tao Zhensheng of the Pingshui Region, Hong Jingwu of the Tunlv Region, and Chen Shoubai of the Qimen Region. After three hours of discussion, a final solution was finally reached. However, it still needs to be approved by the Executive Yuan before it can be implemented. It is estimated that the total amount of export Chinese tea purchased as a result will reach 100,000 dan. This includes 80,000 dan of tea for which mortgage loans have been negotiated and 20,000 dan of tea for which no negotiations have been completed.

The solution decided yesterday is still to maintain the Central Bank's original purchase plan. However, according to the original central purchase price, i.e., 300,000 yuan for Pinglv, 400,000 yuan for Tunlv, and 500,000 yuan for Qihong, the Central Trust Bureau will provide a loan of 120% in the form of packing loans. This loan should first be used to repay the tea loans mortgaged at 70% by the tea merchants at the Farmers Bank of China. As for the promotion of tea sales, it was decided that the China Trust Bureau and the tea merchants would jointly form a joint marketing committee. The China Trust Bureau is responsible for supervision and strives to sell all tea within three months. The profits from the sales will be distributed at a ratio of 70% for tea merchants and 30% for the Central Bank.

### Hua Stocks Rebound, Retail Investors Patronize Unpopular Stocks

Yesterday, the battle between bulls and bears in Hua stocks was even more intense. Deyong Yarn formed a tug-of-war, rising and falling by only a hundred yuan or so. Finally, due to the unusually loose monetary conditions, the afternoon transaction was on a next-day delivery basis. Retail investors were fearless, and the market suddenly rebounded at the close.

At the beginning of the morning, Nos. 198, 47, 49, 185, and 78 were sold, while Nos. 94, 97, and 85 were bought. There was a lot of hovering at the opening. No. 76 was bought and sold immediately. Nos. 185, 152, 223, 91, 84, 235, and 22 were also sold, and Deyong Yarn was forced down to the 3,000 yuan level. Nos. 12, 149, 94, 232, 31, 179, 32, 155, and 162 were all bought. National Goods rose to the limit, once rebounding to 3,120 yuan. Nos. 97, 4, 76, 220, 207, 223, 148, and 167 were sold off in succession, and the price fell back to 2,980 yuan. Nos. 133, 218, 102, 184, 94, etc. were all bought. Near noon, the price was again close to the 3,100 yuan level. The closing price at noon was still hovering. As a result, compared with the previous close, Deyong Yarn and Meyer slightly declined, Xinhuo and Huafeng fell by more than half a percent, Jingfu, Xinguang, Dongxing, and Xinhua each fell by one percent. In the next-day delivery market, Deyong Yarn and Meyer slightly declined, Xinhuo and Huafeng and Xinguang fell by half a percent, and Jingfu fell by less than one percent. The unpopular stocks Tongyi and Zhongfang fell by slightly less than one percent. Only National Goods rose to the limit. Datong, Xinya, and Yonggong each rose by about half a percent. The rest rose or fell differently.

In the afternoon, only spot transactions were made. Because of the next-day delivery relationship, retail buying suddenly became active. Nos. 199, 84, 142, 223, 4, 231, 133, 36, and 94 were all bought and immediately rose. Commerce, Yonggong, Zhongfa, Datong, Xinya, Zhongsiliu, Jiufu, and Meyer all rose to the limit, and people's hearts were greatly encouraged. Although Nos. 198, 97, and 224, 61, etc. were sold, No. 207 was bought again, and the price was repeatedly raised to 3,300 yuan. No. 218, etc. sold off at high prices, and then the price hovered. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsiliu, Xinhuo, and Xinhua rose by half a percent, Zhongfa and Meyer rose to the limit, and Huafeng, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Jingfu slightly rose. The next-day delivery market only traded for half a day. Deyong Yarn and Meyer slightly declined, Xinhuo, Huafeng, and Xinguang fell by half a percent, Jingfu fell by slightly less than one percent. The unpopular stocks Tongyi, Zhongsiliu, Commerce, National Goods, Wuhe, Yonggong, Jiufu, and Xinya rose to the limit. The rest rose from slightly to no more than one percent. Outside the market, various stocks heard news of Nanyang's listing and rose sharply along with Zhonghua. The rest also saw higher prices.

### Securities Arbitrage: Wang Zhixin Explains

Recently, the stock market has been rising, and all parties are extremely concerned. Wang Zhixin, acting concurrently as General Manager of the Shanghai Securities Exchange, made a statement, and his remarks regarding arbitrage are summarized as follows:

A securities arbitrage method is being tested. On the one hand, it facilitates those who hold surplus funds to buy spot goods and sell next-day deliveries at the same time in order to arbitrage interest without bearing the risk of market price fluctuations. On the other hand, it facilitates securities investors to release spot goods and buy next-day deliveries at the same time when they have an urgent need for funds in order to absorb idle funds. In addition to bearing the fixed interest rate, they also do not bear the risk of market price fluctuations. After the ban on trading in gold and foreign currency, those with small amounts of funds, who could originally buy gold jewelry and US dollars, cannot buy them and use them for arbitrage, which is most convenient. Therefore, if arbitrage is used properly, it can indeed absorb surplus funds, adjust short-term finance, and benefit the supply of funds to stabilize interest rates. Recently, market interest rates are still high, and interest arbitrage is between 7-8% and 25%. When finance is relaxed in the future and funds pour in, interest arbitrage will naturally decrease.

### Bullish Party Takes Profits, Bond Market Rally Slightly Weakens

After rising yesterday, the government bond market fell back again. Outside institutions continue to absorb, but the bullish party took profits, and the transaction volume reached 10 million yuan. Type C bonds opened in the morning at a high price of 12,000 yuan to 12,600 yuan, once falling back to 10,900 yuan, and hovered at 11,600 yuan at noon. After the close, the price decreased and saw a low of 1,000 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Type A and B fell by 700 yuan, Type C was stable, Type D fell by 500 yuan, and Type E also fell by a small amount of 600 yuan.

### Asian Steel Shows Well, Rubber is in Demand with Limited Supply

Yesterday, foreign firms absorbed the steel industry's Asian stocks, and both showed well. In the afternoon, with the help of Hua stocks, they continued to prosper. The asking price for rubber stocks remained high, with demand exceeding supply. As a result, He Dexun and Yeguang remained flat, the steel industry's rolling price rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.

### Export Disappears, Yarn Market Continues to Fall

Yesterday, the yarn market's downward trend became stronger. Although yarn factories and construction companies did not allocate a large amount of yarn, those in the industry, in view of the disappearance of exports, intended to sell at all costs. Buyers shrank back, resulting in a one-sided situation. 10-count yarn fell another 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Light-weight Shuangma saw a low of 3.22 million yuan, only 20,000 yuan higher than the construction company's listed price, and still lacked buyers. 20-count Sanyang saw a low of 2.97 million yuan, with slight sales, averaging another drop of 50,000 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Demand Weak

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were characterized by the abundance of supply of construction company chips for next-day delivery, while the demand from dyeing factories and door shops in this street weakened, resulting in a uniform decline in fine cloth, ranging from 1,000 yuan to 6,000-7,000 yuan. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was priced at 149,500 yuan, a decrease of 4,000 yuan, and Caiqiu was 144,000 yuan, a decrease of 7,500 yuan. Zhenzhong also fell by 7,500 yuan to 130,000 yuan. The demand for Shilin cloth also remained sluggish. 190 Meiting Shilin cloth was priced at 365,000 yuan, a decrease of 9,000 yuan. Chuji and Taohuanv both fell by 10,000 yuan to 350,000 yuan. Bleached cloth, which has reached the sales order, also saw a decrease in price of 3,000-4,000 yuan due to the lack of demand from door shops. The prices of other blue cloth and twill cloth were all sluggish. Only Fuchou saw a slight movement in sales, rising by 4,000-5,000 yuan.

### Foreign Businesses Recommend Daige to Participate in Export Promotion Group

[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives of various foreign trading companies in the city held a meeting in the second floor of Jardine Matheson & Co. yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to formally nominate candidates to participate in the 17 small groups of the Export Promotion Council. The meeting will continue today, and the list of 34 representatives will be announced tomorrow. According to the meetings held yesterday and today, they were convened by foreign businesses in the city to accept the Export Promotion Council's suggestion and are completely meetings of the foreign businesses themselves, not convened by the Export Promotion Council as rumored. Therefore, the meeting location was chosen to be at Jardine Matheson & Co.

### Japanese Yarn and Cloth Shipped to Hong Kong via Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] Japanese yarn and cloth have invaded the Nanyang market and are gradually advancing. Recently, two batches have been shipped to Hong Kong via Shanghai and then transferred to various ports by ship. The Taikoo Company's Beihai vessel also carried 2,750 pieces of cotton yarn and 500 boxes of rayon from Kobe, Japan, and arrived at the port yesterday. It is scheduled to load a small amount of Singapore goods in Shanghai today before setting sail south. The yarn from Japan will be shipped to Yangon by the original ship, and the rayon will be unloaded in Hong Kong.

### Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Restriction Methods: Importers and Exporters Face Many Difficulties

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's import and export and fur, grease, and bone trade associations jointly hosted the city's press yesterday to publicly express the current difficulties of these industries. Here are excerpts: (1) The Central Bank stipulates that the maximum period for exchange settlement for consignment exports is only 90 days, but at present, due to poor transportation, it takes more than two or three months for goods to reach Europe and the United States, leaving almost no time for the consignment period. Moreover, many export goods are subject to seasonal restrictions, which will result in foreign merchants taking the opportunity to cut prices. (2) The Central Bank stipulates that export goods shipped before November 7, 1946, must be settled for foreign exchange at the exchange rate before February 6, 1947, and cannot be settled at the current exchange rate. The profits that exporters should have obtained are completely deprived. (3) There is still no formal exchange rate in Siam, and it is settled through Hong Kong dollars. However, there is no formal parity between Siam and Hong Kong, so the time limit for exchange settlement is not permitted by the facts. (4) The Central Bank's regulations on the British exchange rate issued on February 28 of this year have a difference of 8,000 yuan, which is tantamount to剥削（depriving/exploiting） the interests of exporters, causing a loss of 20% on export goods that have been traded but not settled. (5) Exporters' commissions to foreign agents and the payment of all miscellaneous expenses cannot be remitted because the Central Bank often does not approve foreign exchange settlement, which affects the international commercial credit of exporters.

### Improvement of Siamese Rice Export Methods: Large Shipments of Siamese Rice Will Be Transported to Shanghai This Month

The Siamese government has recently improved the rice purchase system, allowing the circulation of domestic grain. Those who transport Siamese rice out of the country will also receive 10% in free pounds. Therefore, Chinese rice merchants in Siam feel more convenient, and the amount of rice purchased has also increased as a result. It is reported that 15,700 tons of rice have been allocated to our country in March, which can be transported to Shanghai in the short term.

### Man-made Silk Asks for Lower Prices

Yesterday's rayon market saw a drop in prices after trading opened due to the continuation of the distribution and sales, with supply exceeding demand in the market. No. 120 Gaoshan initially asked for 6.9 million yuan, but no one paid attention. Soon, it retreated to 6.7 million yuan, and a few boxes were traded. The smallest interim price was 6 million. In the afternoon, due to the fact that there were many who wanted to sell, the minimum price was 550,000 yuan, but the asking price was too low, and holders were unwilling to sell, so the final asking price returned to 700,000 yuan. As a result, it fell by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The factory business situation was even quieter than the next day, and there was mostly no trading. Grade C yesterday called for a next-day trading price of 7.5 million yuan, and ordinary retail called for around 7.1-7.2 million yuan. The high-end five-dan cargo called for 6 million yuan, and the decision-makers were about 400,000 yuan. The same was true for silk goods, which were also quiet. There was no trading in quilt covers, and the asking price remained unchanged from the previous day. Dachengggebi wrinkle slightly traded, initially asking for 7,100-7,200 yuan, and finally trading for 7,000 yuan.

### Qihong Trading is Quiet

Recently, in the foreign tea market, the momentum of Qimen black tea for the 35th year has continued to be quiet. Although there is demand in various parts of Britain, the prices are too high, so they still sigh at the tea. Old Chen's aged green tea, because it is not loved by foreign countries, the buying has subsided, and the process is very leisurely. As for the green tea in the 34th and 35th years, there is a craze for it, and it is still very popular. At this moment, Xiachang, Huacha, Dadechang, and other tea companies have all consulted with the holders, but the attitudes of supply and demand tend to persist, transactions are not prosperous, and the market is hovering consistently, lacking changes. Domestic sales of red and green tea are as stagnant as before, and people's hearts are lingering.

### Wool Sales Sluggish, Prices High, Huom Fourth Book Active

Yesterday's wool market still showed a situation of sluggish sales and high prices. Sellers mostly regretted the difficulty of importing goods, while buyers felt it was difficult to sell out. Most general buyers felt that the prices were too expensive and were unable to add to production, so the market price standard has always hovered steadily. It is predicted that when the sales of the local gang can be advanced, the wool market will inevitably rise several levels again. The trend of Huom's Fourth Book has been very active in recent days. Large and small Western-style tailoring gangs have all added to their inquiries. Imported goods are far more suitable than local factory goods. Local factory goods are wholesaled for 35,000 yuan to more than 60,000 yuan per yard, and imported goods are wholesaled for 200,000 yuan for first-class, 160,000-170,000 yuan for second-class, and 100,000 yuan for third-class.

### Taiwan Sugar Sold at Original Price

Yesterday's sugar market tended to soften again because Taiwan Sugar Company's today's tender sales were allocated according to the eighth phase, with 30% for 24 coarse white at 190,000 yuan, 20% for four and a half military at 200,000 yuan, and 50% for Taiwan red at 140,000 yuan. The association's board price was 194,000 yuan for No. 22 medium sand white, with the decision price at 190,500 yuan, 194,000 yuan for three and a half-rate white, 188,000 yuan to 186,000 yuan and 185,500 yuan for the wharf, and 215,000 yuan for 24 group jiao. 140,000 yuan for the No. 9 phase of the Taiwan Red wharf. Shantou green was 130,000 yuan for the No. goods, and Shunde green was 129,000 yuan to 127,800 yuan. Superior ice flower white was 200,500 yuan, Xinghua white was 185,000 yuan to 183,400 yuan, and inferior red was 131,200 yuan to 131,000 yuan.

### Government Adopts Subsidy Method to Handle Coal Prices

[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the National Economic Commission's Price Committee held its first decision-making meeting in Beijing. Regarding the handling of cotton yarn purchase prices, it was decided to seek a solution that takes into account the interests of manufacturers and does not stimulate market prices. Appropriate methods will also be sought to stabilize the yarn and cloth market and prevent prices from soaring. The issue of foreign cotton supply was also discussed. Furthermore, a subsidy method has been decided upon as a countermeasure for handling coal prices. It is said that all the resolutions have been submitted to Chairman Chiang by Weng Wenhao and Wang Yunwu. If approved, Wang will bring them to Shanghai for announcement.

[Another report] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu is scheduled to take the evening train to Shanghai today, and is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. It is reported that Wang will attend the regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee to be held on Friday, and the board meeting of the Textile Construction Company to be held on Saturday. The board meeting of the Textile Construction Company will discuss how to return the company to private management and the methods for issuing stocks.

### Paper Mills in This City Have a Monthly Output of Approximately 5,000 Tons; Business Was Slack Last Year Due to the Impact of Foreign Goods

[Report from our newspaper] According to a survey by the Paper Manufacturing Industry Association of this city, there are 22 paper mills in this city that are purely privately owned. Among them, Tianjun, Da Zhonghua, Minji, Huafeng, and Huasheng are the largest in scale. Haijing and Huaan are both in a state of suspension. In addition, there are also the Dalu Paper Mill (already demolished), Xingye, Liyong, Huali, Haifeng, and Datong (not included in the 22), all of which are in a state of suspension. The reason for the poor business performance of various factories last year was due to the dumping of foreign goods and the improper procurement of raw materials. The factories that are in operation mainly produce wrapping paper and domestic products similar to foreign products, so the sales are still good, as these types of paper are not affected by foreign goods. As for enemy and puppet properties, since September of the 34th year [1945], the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces, and the Paper Industry Rehabilitation Committee, took over 14 large and small paper mills. Among them, except for some machines that are incomplete or lacking raw materials and cannot be started, the larger ones, such as Da Zhonghua, Sakurai, Jin Xing East Factory and West Factory, and Jiangnan Factory 1 and Factory 2, have all started operation. Currently, Da Zhonghua and Tianzhang have been returned to private management. New East Asia has been leased out. Shanghai Processing Paper Factory, Shanghai Paperware Co., Ltd., and Jiangnan Paper Factory No. 2 have all been sold. The other factories are still being processed.

The types of products produced by each factory are constantly changing according to the needs of the market. Approximately, there are cigarette paper, various paper boards, wrapping paper, rough-edged paper, kraft paper, poster paper, woodfree paper, newsprint, colored paper, cover paper, three-ding paper, typing paper, match paper, etc. The daily output ranges from a minimum of one ton to a maximum of more than thirty tons, with an average of five tons. The maximum total output of various papers by private factories is 9,281 tons, and that of state-owned factories is 540 tons. The maximum total monthly output of national and private factories is 9,721 tons, but the actual output is estimated at half of that, approximately 5,000 tons.

Based on a monthly paper production of 10,000 tons, the required raw materials are estimated as follows: 5,550 tons of wood pulp, 4,000 tons of waste cloth, 1,500 tons of bean stalk pulp, 1,500 tons of waste paper, 380 tons of caustic soda, 250 tons of rosin, 700 tons of alum, 600 tons of bleaching powder, 500 tons of elm wood, 25,700 tons of coal, 15 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, 38,000 pounds of blankets, and 20,000 square feet of copper wire mesh. Among the above raw materials and materials, wood pulp, blankets, and copper wire mesh need to be imported. It is reported that there are wood pulp factories in Northeast China and Taiwan that are urgently preparing to resume production to meet domestic needs.

### The Downturn of Dyes is Difficult to Reverse

[Report from our newspaper] The sluggishness of the dye market and the low actual sales in the past two weeks are unprecedented in the past year. Buyers dare not absorb stock, and sellers are vying to sell. Moreover, actual sales in this city are also scarce, and merchants from other regions are hesitant to move forward due to the increasingly deteriorating transportation situation. In addition, the prices in the inland areas are mostly lower than those in the Shanghai market, so until recently, the dye market has had no support to speak of, and prices are falling every day. According to people in the industry, the low sales to other regions are indeed one of the reasons for the price decline, but the accumulation of stock by retail buyers is also one of the main reasons. Last year, there was a shortage of dyes, and people competed to hoard them. When prices softened, the hoarders competed to release their stocks, so normal businesses were instead in a passive position. Yesterday, the price of Samsung Gray was 320,000 to 350,000 yuan per can, 693 [illegible] yuan, 6 million yuan per dan, No. 16 Di Zi Gray was 350,000 yuan per catty, B.N.C. Yuanqing was 90,000 yuan per catty, and San Ge Soap Yellow was 210,000 yuan per can. There were slight transactions, but no one asked about the rest.

### Goods Tax on Wool Textiles Changed to Tax on Wool Yarn

[Report from our newspaper] The Wool Textile Industry Association previously decided to send representatives to Beijing to personally present to the relevant ministries and commissions the various difficulties of the industry regarding the goods tax issue, proposing to change the tax to wool yarn and to reduce the tax rate. It is now reported that the proposal to tax yarn has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan and was approved at the general meeting on the 11th of this month. The tax rate remains the same and will be announced and implemented soon.

### Shanghai Bristles Stand Out Abroad; Transactions in This City are Sparse

[Report from our newspaper] According to pig bristle exporters, the market price of Shanghai bristles in New York is US$2.10 per pound, Sichuan bristles are US$2.60, and Hankou bristles are US$3.50. Because the government is selling pre-war bristles, except for the relatively high number of transactions in Shanghai bristles, the other pig bristles in Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, etc., are all showing signs of fatigue. In this city, transactions are also mostly in Shanghai bristles, and no one is asking about Sichuan and Hankou bristles. Yesterday, the market price of local Shanghai bristles was 3 million yuan per sima dan, Hankou bristles were 5 million yuan, Sichuan bristles were 3.9 million yuan, Hankou black bristles paired with chests were 5 million yuan per Zhejiang-Ningbo dan, and Chongqing black pig bristles paired with chests were 2.48 million yuan.

### The Leather Market is Weak

[Report from our newspaper] In the past two weeks, the leather market has plummeted. Raw cowhide has fallen from 350,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan per dan, large raw yellow cowhide has fallen from 800,000 yuan to 600,000 yuan per dan, medium boards have fallen from 1 million yuan to 800,000 yuan, and small boards have fallen from 1.6 million yuan to 1.2 million yuan. Tree-patterned leather has fallen from 60,000 yuan to 36,000 yuan per foot.

### Measures for Adjusting Capital of Industrial and Mining Enterprises (Continued Conclusion) Supplementary Calculation Methods to be Announced Soon

5. If the depreciation period stipulated by the Income Tax Law for various fixed assets has expired, but they are still in actual use, the residual value of the assets, that is, one-tenth of their original price, may be calculated according to the specified multiple as the maximum limit for their re-evaluated price.

If the actual usage period of the aforementioned fixed assets that have exceeded the depreciation period is reliably estimated to be more than three years, their residual value may be appropriately increased, but it shall not exceed two-tenths of their original price at most.

If the original price and service life of various fixed assets are unknown, their value shall not be re-evaluated according to these measures. If there are legitimate reasons for the ambiguity, the reasons may be stated (and relevant documents, if any, should also be attached) and submitted to the competent authority for approval, and the following paragraphs shall be followed:

(1) If the original price is verifiable but the service life is unknown, it shall be deemed to have exceeded the prescribed depreciation period and valued in accordance with the preceding paragraph.

(2) If the original price is unknown but the service life is verifiable, the value of the asset may be estimated, and the new replacement value in December of the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936] shall be deducted. The depreciation that should be provided during its service life shall be deducted, and one-half of the remaining price shall be the maximum limit for its re-evaluated price.

(3) If both the original price and the service life are unknown, the new replacement value of the asset in December of the 35th year of the Republic of China [1946] may be estimated, its residual value calculated in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, and then halved to be the maximum limit for its re-evaluated price.

The estimation of the new replacement value in the preceding paragraph shall be done by a specialized technician entrusted by the court.

Calculate the maximum limit of the valuation multiplier for each year according to the national wholesale price numbers compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.

On March 7th, a C-47 military plane came from the northeast direction in the clear blue sky of Hangzhou and slowly landed at the airport of the Jianqiao Air Force School. When the door opened, a plump Englishman with thick, dark, and loose hair stood smiling at the door. He was British Air Force Lieutenant General Sir E.A. Baldwin, accompanied by Mr. Charles North of the British Ministry of Civil Aviation and Major General Lin Weicheng of our Air Force. General Hu Weike, the Director of Education of the Air Force Officer School, received them and showed them around our Air Force School, and they also toured the scenic spots of West Lake.

In the evening, a banquet was held at Lou Wai Lou on the banks of West Lake to welcome them and to talk about the customs and culture of Hangzhou. Those invited to the banquet included Mr. Shen Honglie, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Mr. Lei Fajun, Secretary-General, Mr. Zhou Xiangxian, Mayor of Hangzhou, Mr. Wen, American Civil Advisor of the Air Force, Mr. Zhu Shushou, Director of the Political Department of the Air Force Officer School, Directors Zhang and Yang of the Air Force, Mrs. Cunningham, American Chief Advisor of the Air Force, Mrs. Zhang and Yang, Aide-de-Camp Li Chengyuan of the Air Force, and about two people from the press, including Ms. Liu Xiangnu. The host, Mr. and Mrs. Hu Weike, were busy introducing the guests by name. Afterwards, we sat around eating watermelon seeds.

Sir Baldwin is a person who has made outstanding achievements in World War II. In the spring of 1942, he planned and led 1,200 British aircraft to bomb Cologne, a major town on the Rhine River. This opened a new chapter in the history of large-scale air force bombing. In his conversations, he humbly avoided talking about his military exploits and always spoke and smiled with a peculiar British demeanor.

A Feast Opens with Spirited Drinking Games

The feast opened grandly. Sir Baldwin and Mr. Ross were both good at drinking, especially Mr. Ross. In addition to enjoying drinking, he also liked to play finger-guessing games. I, who was assigned to sit next to him, was his only opponent. After he lost twice, he said, "Let's gamble on luck," and tried again. Mrs. Cunningham also targeted the reporter as her opponent. She accepted the advice of Mayor Zhou, so she won every battle, but every time she won, she would raise her glass and drink it all down. Mr. Wen was also good at drinking. Later, Chairman Shen also drank a few glasses, and the host and hostess diligently offered drinks one by one, making everyone at the party feel extremely happy and excited.

A Thumbs-Up for the Air Force

As the drinking enthusiasm waned, we returned to drinking tea and chatting. I asked Sir Baldwin, "What do you think of our Chinese-trained air force?" He raised his thumb and said, "Very good!" He then said, "Director Hu is an old friend of mine who trained the air force in India. I have worked closely with him. I think that in such a difficult time in China, the air force education is still overcoming material difficulties and continuing to move forward. This is commendable. For example, I personally saw the Stearman training planes that departed from India flying over the Hump. I didn't expect them to still be in use now. This is really an example of creating something out of hardship. Also, as I saw in the Chinese air force camps in India, trees were planted everywhere. Now, trees are also planted everywhere in the Air Force School. This is Mr. Hu's consistent style, and we are worthy of praise."

Hu Weike Says He Was Inspired

Mr. Wen, who was listening from the side, also interjected, "I personally saw this other style of training the air force, which made us feel immensely gratified." Mr. Ross said with a smile, "Very good!" Mrs. Cunningham also said, "We are very happy to be influenced by this in the Chinese air force camps we are training in." Lin Weicheng humbly said, "We still rely on everyone's help." Mr. Hu Weike was a little embarrassed and said, "All of this is inspired by the principal!"

China and Britain Sign Civil Aviation Agreement

Baldwin then talked eloquently about his mission. Because he has many good Chinese friends, he loves China. This time, China and Britain are going to sign a civil aviation agreement, and he was assigned as the head of the delegation. He was happy to accept this task. He had met with our authorities in Nanjing, and now he was going to various places to investigate. He had been to Shanghai, and now he was in Hangzhou. The next morning, he would fly back to Shanghai, then to Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places, and then fly back to Nanjing before signing the aviation agreement. He said that he loved Hangzhou very much. Hangzhou is like Switzerland, although the area is not large, but the whole city is very clean. He also said that a place like Hangzhou could be built into an ideal cultural city. Because he loved Hangzhou, we welcomed him to come again. He said, "When I finish my business, I will try to come again."

Friendly Relations and Great Cooperation

This banquet was truly a grand celebration of a part of the air force generals of China, Britain, and the United States. Everyone talked very happily. Everyone felt that the friendly relations between China, Britain, and the United States should be more cordial and that closer cooperation was needed, and that close cooperation should be carried out under the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

The night was already deep, but the guests were still reluctant to leave. Only the sound of the boatmen on the lake shore calling out "It's time to go home" awakened this group of guests. They tidied their clothes, wished each other well, and parted.

### Hong Kong Government Decides to Levy Income Tax

— Hong Kong, News on the [day not specified] - Our Special Correspondent Zi Jian

In recent days, amidst the voice of changing the Governor of Hong Kong, a wave has occurred in society, with everyone from salaried employees to the wealthy being swept into this wave. The origin of this wave is the Hong Kong government's decision to levy income tax. This major decision has been brewing for almost a year.

Tax Department Actively Preparing

Since the Hong Kong government announced at the end of July last year that the financial year from 1946 to March 31, 1947, would have expenditures of over 160 million and income of only over 50 million, the Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong government announced that the Hong Kong government was considering continuing to levy the war tax or income tax implemented in 1941. At that time, it caused an uproar among people in Hong Kong, regardless of Chinese or Western. This "consideration" was silent for half a year. Last month, Hong Kong government agencies suddenly revealed that they would implement income tax collection on April 1. Mr. Peter Dale, the Income Tax Commissioner of the Hong Kong government, who had been immersed in research in Britain for more than a year and was assigned by the British Colonial Office, came to Hong Kong without a sound at that time and began to prepare his Tax Department (Inland Revenue Department).

In order to make up for the financial deficit of over 100 million and reduce the burden on British taxpayers on Hong Kong, levying income tax is inevitable. However, Hong Kong and Chinese residents, in order to maintain their "hand-to-mouth" lives, are also difficult to succumb to. They may know that there is nothing they can do to prevent the Hong Kong government from implementing this "economic emergency measure plan," but they cannot help but express their views and show the public's reaction to the government.

Chinese and Foreigners Alike Express Panic

"I would rather run into Stanley Prison than pay income tax!" This is a very humorous sentence, and the speaker is certainly not a Chinese businessman. Another young British gentleman also said: "Because of the extreme shortage of housing, I have no choice but to live in a hotel with my wife for a long time. We have just overcome the difficulties because the company recently added some salary to me, and also added some living allowances to compensate for my deficiencies. But now the government is going to take away part of my income again, wouldn't that make me retreat into a dead end again? The salary increase and allowances I am getting now are all empty, because the cost of the hotel is shockingly high, but this is the only place I can find to live."

The opinions of our overseas Chinese are: "Most of the formal businessmen in Hong Kong after the war, engaged in legitimate business, can only maintain their facade and have no actual profit. The losses during the war cannot be compensated, unlike those with abundant floating capital who use floating capital to manipulate the market and obtain huge profits. When the government levies income tax, only formal businessmen pay, while the wealthy and those with floating capital will be able to avoid it. It is really extremely unfair." Some say: "The current business situation is sluggish, even worse than last year. It is not the time to levy income tax and business tax." Some say: "The most severely hit by the levying of income tax are the middle-income salaried class. The poor class is not a problem, while the wealthy class, such as the nouveau riche who have recently come to Hong Kong from Shanghai, will always find a way to get by because it is mostly difficult to find out what kind of income they have."

The reaction of the overseas Chinese to the Hong Kong government's levying of income tax does not seem as intense as that of foreigners. They do not express opposition, but believe that life is difficult after the war, and that it is not the time to levy taxes, or point out that it is unfair. "People have an obligation to pay taxes." It seems that our overseas Chinese "understand" this principle more than the British!

The Focus Is Not on the Wealthy

The reason why the Hong Kong government's levying of income tax has aroused strong opposition from residents is that, according to the disclosure of the Tax Commissioner, anyone with an annual salary of more than 5,000 yuan will pay at least 14% tax! An annual salary of 5,000 yuan, or a monthly income of 400 yuan, is only enough to support a family of five in today's Hong Kong. This is the minimum expenditure for a middle-class family. If 14% is deducted again, they simply cannot live! A worker with a monthly income of two or three hundred yuan, without the burden of a family, lives a more carefree life than a manager with a monthly income of one thousand yuan! Therefore, unless the Hong Kong government raises the lower limit of income tax collection to a considerable amount, such as 50,000 yuan or 100,000 yuan, and focuses on the wealthy, it will inevitably lead to more corruption and tax evasion.

Income Tax is the First Step of the War Tax

The "war tax" implemented in 1941 is divided into: (1) Property tax - 14% levied according to land price or house price; (2) Salary tax - 6% levied on an annual income of 5,000 yuan, and 14% levied on income above 5,000 yuan; (3) Profit tax - 7% levied on annual profits of 50,000 yuan, and 14% levied on profits above 50,000 yuan; (4) Interest tax - 10% levied. This "war tax" arose because of raising war expenses, but peace has prevailed for years, and the regulations of this "war tax" have not been formally abolished. Therefore, some social celebrities believe that the Hong Kong government's levying of income tax will be the first step in restoring the levying of the "war tax." The other three types of war tax will surely continue to be implemented.

Before deciding to levy income tax, the Hong Kong government has already begun to increase other taxes in order to maintain budget balance, such as water fees, port usage taxes, pilotage fees, lighthouse fees, and ship berthing fees, all of which are higher than before the war. In addition, stamp duty and tobacco tax were restored, and food and beverage tax (10% levied on each guest of more than 5 yuan) and dance tax were levied. The direct and indirect burdens on residents in Hong Kong are not small. Now, some people suggest that the Hong Kong government levy luxury tax, issue lottery tickets or government bonds, in lieu of levying income tax. Some people are trembling with fear, wondering if there will be a day when a "head tax" will be levied?

### Under the Five-Yuan System: The Administrative Organ of Judicial Administration - Supreme Court Presiding Judges and Judges

Introduction: Since the implementation of the Five-Yuan system, the administrative organ for judicial administration has repeatedly faced issues, and there have been constant changes in the legal system. Now that the Constitution has been promulgated, which Yuan will administer judicial administration has not been clearly defined, leading to two different interpretations. It is heard that the draft organization laws for the Administrative and Judicial Yuans, submitted by the National Defense Supreme Council to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, adopt the view that the Administrative Yuan should administer it. Does this truly align with the fundamental purpose of the Constitution? This article briefly narrates the evolution of the legal system since the implementation of the Five-Yuan system, discusses its merits and demerits, and conducts a study on the administrative organ for judicial administration under the Constitution.

Evolution of the Five-Yuan System's Legal System

The implementation of the Five-Yuan system began with the promulgation of the National Government Organization Law on October 3, 1928. Article 33 of the same law stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the National Government, administering judicial trial, judicial administration, the discipline of officials, and administrative trial." The Judicial Organization Law was promulgated on October 20 of the same month, and according to its Article 1, a Judicial Administration Department was established as a component of the Judicial Yuan. The Judicial Yuan Organization Law was amended on November 17 of the same year, renaming the Judicial Administration Department as the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Article 37 of the amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on June 15, 1931, stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the National Government, administering judicial trial." Whether judicial administration was entirely administered by the Judicial Yuan was not clearly defined. However, during the period of its implementation, the Ministry of Judicial Administration remained subordinate to the Judicial Yuan. Subsequently, Article 24, Paragraph 5 of the amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on December 30, 1931, stipulated: "The appointment and removal of administrative and judicial officials above the recommended rank shall be decided by the Executive Yuan Council." Article 35, Paragraph 1 stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest trial organ of the National Government." Article 36 stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan has the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries." Consequently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. The amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on February 17, 1934, amended Article 24, Paragraph 5 to: "The appointment and removal of administrative officials above the recommended rank shall be decided by the Executive Yuan Council." Article 35 was amended to: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the National Government." Article 36 was amended to: "The Judicial Yuan has the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries." Thus, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was once again subordinate to the Judicial Yuan. The amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on December 12, 1942, added the two characters for "judicial" to Article 24, Paragraph 5, and deleted the five characters for "Ministry of Judicial Administration" from Article 36, reverting to the original text promulgated on December 30, 1931. The Ministry of Judicial Administration was then again transferred to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, which is the current system. However, regarding judicial administration of the trial organs, what the Ministry of Judicial Administration administers is only the part concerning the High Courts and District Courts. All judicial administration concerning the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries, even during the period when the Ministry of Judicial Administration was subordinate to the Executive Yuan, was still administered by the Judicial Yuan.

The Mistake of Division of Authority Between the Two Yuans

The Five-Yuan system was invented by the Founding Father of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. The Outline of National Reconstruction, personally drafted by him, lists the various departments of the Executive Yuan without any mention of a Ministry of Justice or a Ministry of Judicial Administration. Citing the establishment of the Dali Yuan in Guangdong by the Founding Father, all judicial administration currently administered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration was administered by that court. This shows that it was the Founding Father's original intention that judicial administration should not be administered by the Executive Yuan. The omission of a Ministry of Justice or a Ministry of Judicial Administration in the list of the Executive Yuan's departments in the Outline of National Reconstruction was not an oversight. However, since the implementation of the Five-Yuan system, the National Government Organization Law has been amended twice, transferring the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which was subordinate to the Judicial Yuan, to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. The reason for this is quite puzzling. Some say: "The Judicial Yuan establishes a department to administer judicial administration, naming it the Ministry of Judicial Administration. People see the name of the department and realize that it clearly has the characters for 'administration,' so they advocate changing it to be subordinate to the Executive Yuan. If the Judicial Yuan did not specifically establish this department and directly administered the matters within the scope of the department's authority, or even if it did specifically establish the department but named it the Ministry of Legal Affairs, without revealing the characters for 'administration,' then the Ministry of Judicial Administration would certainly not be subordinate to the Executive Yuan." Ordinary people may inevitably have this notion, but we believe that those who advocated for the change in subordination must have had other reasons. However, we have no way of knowing those reasons. There is no need to explore this reason. Let's discuss its merits and demerits. After the Ministry of Judicial Administration was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan still administered a portion of judicial administration, as mentioned above. Since the highest judicial administration organs were divided into two, judicial administration could not be unified as a result. This mistake has approximately five points: First, government orders inevitably conflict, undermining the credibility of the government. For example, according to Article 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the travel time to be deducted when calculating the statutory period is determined by the highest judicial administration organ. The travel time to the District Court or the High Court should indeed be determined by the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The travel time to the Supreme Court (refer to Article 34, Paragraph 2, Article 233, Paragraph 2, Article 496, Paragraph 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure) should still be determined by the Judicial Yuan. This is because the Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial administration organ for the Supreme Court, and the travel time to the Supreme Court cannot be determined by the Executive Yuan or judicial administration on its behalf. This is evident from the fact that the highest judicial administration organ mentioned in Article 463, Paragraph 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure has always been interpreted as referring to the Judicial Yuan without any doubt. If the travel time from a certain place to the capital's High Court determined by the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration is different from the travel time from that place to the Supreme Court determined by the Judicial Yuan, it will inevitably undermine the credibility of the government. Article 88 of the Court Organization Law states: "Those who have supervisory power according to the preceding article may issue orders to the supervised personnel regarding matters of their duties to make them pay attention." If, regarding the same type of matter, the President of the Judicial Yuan issues such orders to the judges of the Supreme Court, and the Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration issues such orders to the judges of the High Court, it goes without saying that it will undermine the credibility of the government. Second, it is not easy to maintain contact between the Supreme Court and lower courts in handling affairs, hindering work efficiency. Article 56 of the Court Organization Law stipulates: "The internal regulations of courts and branches at all levels and the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office shall be determined by order." The Judicial Yuan is in charge of determining the internal regulations of the Supreme Court, and the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration is in charge of determining the internal regulations of the lower courts. It is not easy to maintain contact between the Supreme Court and lower courts in handling affairs, hindering work efficiency. If the President of the Judicial Yuan and the Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration have different views on the exercise of supervisory power, it will be even more difficult to maintain contact. Third, the same affairs are handled separately by two organs, resulting in a waste of manpower and resources. For example, the amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure in 1945, the supplementary regulations for handling civil and criminal lawsuits after repatriation, and the regulations for handling civil and criminal cases received by Taiwanese courts were all instances where the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration each submitted draft laws to the Legislative Yuan as their respective competent matters. Fourth, it is difficult to be prompt when one type of matter is handled jointly by two organs. For example, Item D of the Amnesty and Commutation Order for Criminals promulgated on New Year's Day in 1947 stipulates: "The detailed measures for commutation shall be determined jointly by the Judicial Yuan and the Executive Yuan." Before these measures were formulated and promulgated, all criminal cases that should have been commuted could not be handled. However, they were only formulated and promulgated as late as February 19 because the back-and-forth consultations between the two Yuans took a lot of time. And after the Executive Yuan received the draft plan determined by the Judicial Yuan, it must order it to be submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for review and reply, which further delayed the process. If judicial administration had not lost its unity, these measures would have been promulgated long ago. There are many other examples of matters that must be handled jointly due to the lack of unity in judicial administration. For example, Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Attorney Law stipulates: "The measures for attorney review shall be determined jointly by the Examination Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Executive Yuan." Fifth, the review of qualifications and the evaluation of judicial officials' performance cannot be linked. The Supreme Court is the court of final instance, and most of the cases that have been tried by the High Court are appealed to the Supreme Court. Whether the judges of the High Court and the District Court handle cases properly and quickly is best known to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court truly evaluates, records and reviews each case during trial, so that the judicial administration officials have a basis for punishing and rewarding judicial officials, it will definitely be beneficial to improving efficiency and reforming the judiciary. Now, because the Ministry of Judicial Administration is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, the trial cases of the Supreme Court and the evaluation of the performance of judicial officials by the Ministry of Judicial Administration cannot be linked, which is a pity. From this point of view, it is not a good policy in terms of legislative theory for judicial administration to be administered separately by the Executive and Judicial Yuans.

Review of the Administering Organ

Article 77 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the State, administering the trial of civil, criminal, and administrative lawsuits, and the discipline of public functionaries." Article 78 stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan interprets the Constitution and has the power to unify the interpretation of laws and orders." Although there is no explicit statement that judicial administration is administered by the Judicial Yuan, it is naturally understood in interpretation that judicial administration is entirely administered by the Judicial Yuan. The reasons are as follows:

(1) Article 63 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Legislative Yuan has the power to resolve legal bills, budget bills, martial law bills, amnesty bills, war declaration bills, peace treaty bills, treaty bills, and other important matters of the State." Although the administration of legislation has not been explicitly stated to have the power to administer, the Legislative Yuan also has various administrative matters, such as matters concerning the receipt, dispatch, and safekeeping of documents, matters concerning the allocation, drafting, and compilation of documents, matters concerning meeting records, matters concerning the appointment, removal, and supervision of staff, matters concerning the safekeeping of seals, and matters concerning general affairs, all of which relate to the administration of legislation. If these administrative matters cannot be administered by the Legislative Yuan, the legislative power will not be able to be exercised properly. Article 83 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Examination Yuan is the highest examination organ of the State, administering matters such as examinations, appointments, qualifications, performance evaluations, etc." Although the administration of examinations has not been explicitly stated to have the power to administer, looking at the matters listed in the current Examination Yuan Organization Law regarding the functions of the Secretariat and the Counselor's Office, all of them relate to the administration of examinations. Moreover, according to the current regulations on the organization of the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Personnel may establish offices in various provinces to handle the qualification matters of commissioned public functionaries in those provinces. Matters concerning the establishment of the offices of the Ministry of Personnel and the appointment, removal, and supervision of their staff also relate to the exercise of examinations. After the implementation of the Constitution, it can be asserted that these administrative matters must be administered by the Examination Yuan. Article 90 of the Constitution stipulates: “The Control Yuan is the highest control organ of the State, exercising the powers of consent, impeachment, censure, and audit.” Regarding the administration of control, such as the functions of the Secretariat and Counselors listed in the current Control Yuan Organization Law, and matters concerning the establishment of control offices in various regions and the appointment, removal, and supervision of their staff, it has not been explicitly stated that they have the power to administer, but after the implementation of the Constitution, it will undoubtedly be administered by the Control Yuan. Therefore, the Constitution's provisions on the powers of the five Yuans are merely listing their exclusive, competent affairs. In order for the five Yuans to properly handle the exclusive, competent affairs within their powers without any obstruction, they should naturally administer the necessary administrative affairs related to them, without the need for explicit provisions. The Executive Yuan also has this type of administrative affair, so the administration administered by the Executive Yuan is divided into two types: The first type of administration, such as foreign affairs, national defense, education, and transportation, is its exclusive, competent affair, which is opposed to legislation, judiciary, examination, and control. The second type of administration, such as the appointment, removal, and supervision of subordinate staff, is the necessary administrative affair for properly handling its exclusive, competent affairs. This is the administration of administration (because its exclusive, competent affairs are also called administration, if it is simply called administration, the meaning of administration may not be clear), which is opposed to legislative administration, judicial administration, examination administration, and control administration. The administration referred to in Article 53 of the Constitution only refers to the first type of administration, and the second type of administration should be interpreted as naturally administered by the Executive Yuan, and does not include legislative administration, judicial administration, examination administration, or control administration. The reason why the Constitution did not explicitly stipulate that judicial administration is administered by the Judicial Yuan, as in Article 76 of the May 5th Draft Constitution, is to maintain the consistency of its legislative style, and it was not appropriate to treat judicial administration differently, not because it was believed that judicial administration should be administered by the Executive Yuan.

(2) Article 79, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall have a President and a Vice President, each one person." However, the matters stipulated in Articles 77 and 78 to be administered by the Judicial Yuan do not fall under the duties of the President and Vice President. Article 3 of the Court Organization Law stipulates: "Trials in District Courts shall be conducted by one judge acting alone." "Trials in High Courts shall be conducted by a collegial panel of three judges." "Trials in the Supreme Court shall be conducted by a collegial panel of five or three judges." Therefore, the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits is not the duty of the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Organization Law stipulates: "The trial of the Administrative Court shall be conducted by a collegial panel of five judges." Therefore, the trial of administrative lawsuits is not the duty of the President of the Judicial Yuan. Article 7 of the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries Organization Law stipulates: "The deliberation of disciplinary cases by the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries shall have the attendance of five or more members." Therefore, the discipline of public functionaries is not the duty of the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. Article 79, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall have several Grand Justices to administer the matters stipulated in Article 78 of this Constitution." Therefore, the interpretation of the Constitution and the unification of the interpretation of laws and orders are not the duties of the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. Moreover, Article 80 of the Constitution stipulates: "Judges shall conduct independent trials based on the law, free from any interference, outside of party affiliations." Therefore, the President of the Judicial Yuan not only has no trial duties, but also may not interfere with the independent trials of judges. So, what is the purpose of establishing the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan? The matters of the President of the Judicial Yuan explicitly stipulated in the Constitution are no more than two points: Article 44 stipulates: "The President, for disputes between the Yuans, in addition to those prescribed in this Constitution, may convene a meeting of the Presidents of the Yuans concerned to resolve them." Article 115 stipulates: "If a certain article of the Provincial Autonomy Law encounters significant obstacles during its implementation, after the Judicial Yuan convenes the relevant parties to present their opinions, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the President of the Legislative Yuan, the President of the Examination Yuan, and the President of the Control Yuan shall form a committee with the President of the Judicial Yuan as chairman to propose a solution." Is the establishment of the President of the Judicial Yuan for this purpose? However, these are not frequent matters. If the Judicial Yuan did not establish a President, these matters could be handled by the Chief Justice. Why is a President specifically established in the Judicial Yuan for this? The establishment of the President of the Judicial Yuan must have its regular duties. Article 3 of the Draft Judicial Yuan Organization Law stipulates: "The Grand Justices Conference of the Judicial Yuan shall be composed of eleven Grand Justices. The President and Vice President are ex officio Grand Justices and are included in the aforementioned number. The Grand Justices Conference shall be chaired by the President and shall exercise the power to interpret the Constitution and unify the interpretation of laws and orders." However, it is doubtful whether this is in line with the fundamental purpose of the Constitution. If the fundamental purpose of the Constitution were like this, it would necessarily follow the examples of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan being elected by the members of the Legislative Yuan, and the President and Vice President of the Control Yuan being elected by the members of the Control Yuan (refer to Articles 66 and 92 of the Constitution), and stipulate that the Judicial Yuan shall have a President and a Vice President, each one person, appointed by the President from among the Grand Justices. Why is it that in addition to stipulating the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, it is separately stipulated that there shall be several Grand Justices? Moreover, Article 11 of the same draft law stipulates: "The term of office of the President and Vice President shall be six years." While this is not objectionable, Article 81 of the Constitution stipulates: "Judges shall hold office for life." Since the President and Vice President should have a fixed term of office, and it is stipulated that they are ex officio Grand Justices, it is even more contradictory. Therefore, it is clear that the Constitution stipulates that the Judicial Yuan shall have a President and a Vice President, each one person, and their regular duties must be to manage judicial administration, not to make them ex officio Grand Justices.

(3) Article 37 of the amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on June 15, 1931, stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the National Government, administering judicial trial." It did not explicitly state which Yuan administered judicial administration. Although the wording of this is not exactly the same as that of Article 77 of the Constitution, there is no difference in substance. Before the promulgation of the amended National Government Organization Law on December 30, 1931, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was still subordinate to the Judicial Yuan, and was not affected by the fact that it did not explicitly state that judicial administration was administered by the Judicial Yuan. Therefore, the provisions of Article 77 of the Constitution regarding the Judicial Yuan's trial power do not hinder the President of the Judicial Yuan from administering all judicial administration, and there is evidence of its exercise. Article 1 of the Court Organization Law stipulates: "The courts shall try civil and criminal lawsuits and administer non-litigation events according to the jurisdiction stipulated by law." The so-called administration of non-litigation events according to law does not include judicial administration. This can be clearly understood by looking at the provisions of Article 10 of the Judicial Law, which stipulate that non-litigation events are only under the jurisdiction of the District Court. Trying civil and criminal lawsuits and administering non-litigation events are the exclusive powers of the judges, and are not the powers of the President of the court. However, Articles 11, 18, and 23 of the same law stipulate that each level of court shall have a President, who shall manage all the administrative affairs of the court. This does not conflict with the provisions of Article 1, because the court must be able to administer the necessary administrative affairs related to it in order to properly exercise its trial power without any obstruction, without the need for specific provisions in Article 1. The relationship between Article 77 and Article 79, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution is actually no different from the relationship between Article 1 and Articles 11, 18, and 23 of the Court Organization Law. One cannot say that because Article 77 of the Constitution stipulates that the power of trial belongs to the Judicial Yuan, the President of the Judicial Yuan has no power to administer judicial administration.

(4) The Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries are trial organs. However, Article 23 of the Court Organization Law stipulates: "The Supreme Court shall have a President, appointed by special appointment, to manage all the administrative affairs of the court." Article 2 of the Administrative Court Organization Law stipulates: "The Administrative Court shall have a President to manage all the administrative affairs of the court." Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries Organization Law stipulates: "The Chairman of the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries shall manage the affairs of the Commission, supervise the subordinate staff, and may investigate the progress of disciplinary cases, but may not interfere with the discipline." Therefore, the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries all have administrative affairs related to trial. These administrative affairs, i.e., judicial administration, are administered by the President or Chairman, and the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries are organs subordinate to the Judicial Yuan, and their administrative affairs are supervised by the President of the Judicial Yuan. Some administrative affairs, such as the appointment and removal of staff above the recommended rank, must also be submitted to the President of the Judicial Yuan for approval. This was the case even during the period when the Ministry of Judicial Administration was subordinate to the Executive Yuan. Article 4 of the Draft Judicial Yuan Organization Law stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall have the following organs: (1) The Supreme Court, (2) The Administrative Court, (3) The Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries." Article 10, Paragraph 1 stipulates: "The President shall manage the affairs of the Yuan and supervise the administrative affairs of the subordinate organs." Therefore, it is planned to be the same after the implementation of the Constitution. However, those who adopt the view that judicial administration should be administered by the Executive Yuan are merely transferring the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. All judicial administration concerning the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries still cannot but be administered by the Judicial Yuan. The subordination of the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries to the Judicial Yuan is no different in nature from the subordination of the High Courts and District Courts to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Since the nature of judicial administration is administrative, the High Courts and District Courts are subordinate to the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the Executive Yuan, then the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries must also be subordinate to the Executive Yuan in order for the argument to be consistently applied. Not only that, but the Grand Justices interpret the Constitution and exercise the power to unify the interpretation of laws and orders, which is the exercise of judicial power. However, the repair of the office buildings of the Grand Justices, the payment of the salaries of the Grand Justices, the receipt, allocation, and safekeeping of documents requesting interpretation, and the sealing and issuing of answer documents are all judicial administrative affairs. Therefore, the Grand Justices must also be made subordinate to the Executive Yuan in order for the argument that judicial administration should be administered by the Executive Yuan to be consistently applied. Now, only the High Courts and District Courts are made subordinate to the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the Executive Yuan, which is only reducing the amount of judicial administration that the Judicial Yuan should not administer, and transferring all the judicial administration that the Judicial Yuan should not administer to the Executive Yuan. If this is the case, and my argument has been consistently applied, how is it different from laughing at someone for fleeing fifty steps when you have fled a hundred steps? Since it is impossible to transfer all judicial administration to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, why can't the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts still be administered by the Judicial Yuan? Some say: "The High Courts and District Courts are the judicial organs of the provinces, cities, and counties, which is different from the Supreme Court, which is purely a central judicial organ." However, it is clearly stipulated in Article 107, Paragraph 4 of the Constitution that the establishment and implementation of the judicial system by the central government is a matter for the central government. Therefore, although the High Courts and District Courts are located in the provinces, cities, and counties, they are central judicial organs, which is no different from the Supreme Court. Moreover, according to the current system, the public functionary disciplinary organs originally had the Central Public Functionary Disciplinary Commission and the Local Public Functionary Disciplinary Commission, and their supervision of affairs and personnel administration are all handled directly by the Judicial Yuan. Citing that the offices of the Ministry of Personnel, the auditing offices, and the control offices in various provinces are all supervised separately by the Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan, respectively, it is also not permissible to treat the High Courts and District Courts of the provinces, cities, and counties differently and should be administered by the Judicial Yuan.

(5) According to the provisions of Article 77 of the Constitution, the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits, except for active military personnel who may be subject to military trials, for which there are special provisions in Article 9 of the Constitution, is administered by the Judicial Yuan. If the Judicial Yuan cannot administer it directly, then its administering organ must be a component of the Judicial Yuan's organization. The courts at all levels are components of the Judicial Yuan's organization, as can be seen from Article 82 of the Constitution, which stipulates: "The organization of courts at all levels shall be determined by law." This article is listed in Chapter 7, Judiciary, and not in Chapter 5, Executive. There is no doubt about it. If the High Courts and District Courts were established by the Ministry of Justice subordinate to the Executive Yuan (it is heard that the draft Executive Yuan Organization Law stipulates that the Executive Yuan shall have a Ministry of Justice), even if their names are also courts, they are still components of the Executive Yuan's organization, and not components of the Judicial Yuan's organization. Looking at Article 4 of the Draft Judicial Yuan Organization Law, which stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall have the following organs: (1) The Supreme Court, (2) The Administrative Court, (3) The Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries," it does not stipulate that the Judicial Yuan shall establish High Courts in various provinces and cities, and District Courts in various counties and cities. Therefore, it can be known that the High Courts and District Courts are not established by the Judicial Yuan, i.e., they are not components of the Judicial Yuan's organization. Since they are not established by the Judicial Yuan, then it is clear that they are established by the Ministry of Justice subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and are components of the Executive Yuan's organization. Is it not a violation of the Constitution to have components of the Executive Yuan's organization administer the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits? Although the parties may appeal or protest the judgments or rulings of the High Courts to the Supreme Court, it is no different from filing an administrative lawsuit with the Administrative Court established by the Judicial Yuan against the administrative organ that made the decision on the re-appeal. The administrative organ that made the decision on the re-appeal does not lose its nature as a component of the Executive Yuan because of this. So, how can the High Courts be considered components of the Judicial Yuan because of this? Some say: "Most of the courts in foreign countries are established by the Ministry of Justice subordinate to the Cabinet. Why is it not a violation of the Constitution?" However, the constitutions of foreign countries mostly stipulate that the courts shall administer the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits, and the fact that the courts are established by the Ministry of Justice subordinate to the Cabinet is mostly permitted by their constitutions. Article 77 of our Constitution stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall administer the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits. Therefore, only components of the Judicial Yuan's organization can have this power." The provisions of the constitutions are completely different from each other. How can we apply their laws to our situation? Some say: "Since the Constitution clearly stipulates that the Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the State, it only needs to administer the Supreme Court, which is the highest level of trial, as its component, and the High Courts and District Courts, which administer lower-level trials, are not included." That is not the case. The so-called "highest" means "supreme," which does not necessarily exclude the lower levels. If it were as they say, then since the Constitution clearly stipulates that the Executive Yuan is the highest administrative organ, why don't the opposing theorists allow it to administer the judicial administration of the Supreme Court, and only allow it to administer the judicial administration of the lower courts? Moreover, what is the basis in the Constitution for making the lower courts components of the Executive Yuan's organization and allowing them to administer the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits? There is no need to waste words to explain why this argument is untenable. Since the courts at all levels that try civil and criminal lawsuits must be components of the Judicial Yuan's organization, then Article 4 of the Draft Judicial Yuan Organization Law must be changed to: "The Judicial Yuan shall have the following organs: (1) The Supreme Court, the High Courts of various provinces and cities, and the District Courts of various counties and cities, (2) The Administrative Court, (3) The Central Public Functionary Disciplinary Commission and the Local Public Functionary Disciplinary Commissions of various provinces and cities," in order to comply with the fundamental purposes of Article 77 and Article 82 of the Constitution. Since the provisions of the Judicial Yuan Organization Law should be like this, it goes without saying that the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts should be administered by the Judicial Yuan.

Refutation of Two Arguments

The above are the reasons why it should be interpreted under the Constitution that all judicial administration is administered by the Judicial Yuan. Now, I will refute the two arguments held by the opposing theorists as follows:

One argument is that "the Ministries of Justice in foreign countries are all subordinate to the Cabinet. Our Executive Yuan is equivalent to the Cabinet in foreign countries, so the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of Judicial Administration should naturally be subordinate to the Executive Yuan." According to this, the Federal Ministry of Justice in the United States can only supervise prosecutors and has no power to appoint, remove, or supervise the judges of the courts. This is completely different from the Ministries of Justice in civil law countries, which have overall control over the judicial administration of the entire country. Although the Ministries of Justice in civil law countries are subordinate to the Cabinet, their Ministers of Justice also have the power to administer the judicial administration of the highest-level courts. It goes without saying that it is inappropriate for the Ministry of Justice, which is at the same level as the highest-level court, to supervise the highest-level court. The reason why they do this is that they want to ensure that judicial administration is not disunited, and they do not want to establish a judicial official above the highest-level court who is equal in status to the Premier of the Cabinet. Therefore, they put two organs of the same level in the position of supervision and being supervised. Since our country has implemented the Five-Yuan system, and there is a President of the Judicial Yuan above the highest-level court who is equal in status to the Premier of the Executive Yuan, all judicial administration should be administered by the President of the Judicial Yuan. If we adopt the system of civil law countries, then not only the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts should be administered by the Ministry of Justice of the Executive Yuan, but also the judicial administration concerning the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries must also be administered by the Executive Yuan, and the Judicial Yuan will have no room for existence. If we cannot but establish the Judicial Yuan and allow it to administer the judicial administration concerning the Supreme Court, then why is it necessary to transfer the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan and establish a department to administer it, causing judicial administration to lose its unity? This argument is completely inconsistent with the spirit of the Five-Yuan system and is clearly unacceptable.

The second argument is that "Article 76 of the May 5th Draft Constitution explicitly stipulated: 'The Judicial Yuan shall administer judicial administration.' Later, the Political Consultative Conference resolved the principles for amending the draft constitution, and Item 4 stated: 'The Judicial Yuan shall be the highest court of the State and shall not also administer judicial administration. It shall be organized by several Grand Justices.' Therefore, Article 82 of the draft constitution submitted to the National Assembly stipulated: 'The Judicial Yuan is the highest trial organ of the State, administering the trial of civil, criminal, and administrative lawsuits and the interpretation of the Constitution.' There were no words about administering judicial administration. Article 77 of the Constitution also did not have such words. Judging from the legislative process, the Judicial Yuan actually has no power to administer judicial administration." According to this, the purpose of interpreting laws is to explore the meaning of the drafters, or to clarify the meaning of the law itself. There used to be disputes, but scholars in recent times have generally adopted the latter view. Therefore, the process of drafting the law and the reasons for the changes in the draft cannot restrict the interpreter. The meaning of the law should be clarified academically based on what is published as the law. The meaning of the Constitution is that the Judicial Yuan has the power to administer judicial administration, which has been clarified based on the above-mentioned reasons. The reason why the Constitution did not explicitly stipulate that judicial administration is administered by the Judicial Yuan, as in the May 5th Draft Constitution, is to maintain the consistency of its legislative style, and it was not appropriate to treat judicial administration differently. This has also been explained in Reason 1. As for the words in Item 4 of the principles for amending the draft constitution resolved by the Political Consultative Conference, which stated that the Judicial Yuan shall be the highest court of the State and shall not also administer judicial administration, it was not published as law in the Constitution and cannot be used to interpret the Constitution. Even if the Judicial Yuan directly administers the highest level of trial and does not establish a separate Supreme Court, there are administrative affairs concerning the highest level of trial. If the Judicial Yuan is not subordinate to the Executive Yuan, this type of judicial administration should still be administered by it. Since this type of judicial administration should be administered by it, why shouldn't the judicial administration concerning lower-level trials also be administered by it? This argument is also without reason.

Conclusion: From the above discussion, it is clear that all judicial administration concerning the trial portion should be administered by the Judicial Yuan under the interpretation of the Constitution. There is absolutely no reason to transfer the portion concerning the lower courts to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. If the provisions of the draft organization laws for the Administrative and Judicial Yuans regarding this point are passed, it will not be in accordance with the Constitution. The Legislative Yuan has always been cautious in enacting laws and will not pass them easily.

### The Communist Party's Administrative Divisions in Shandong

Novel Tricks: Everyone Gets to Be an Official

In terms of administrative divisions, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intentionally destroys the original government structure. Originally, the government had a total of one municipality directly under the Executive Yuan, three ordinary municipalities, seventeen commissioner districts, and one hundred and seven counties in Shandong. Today, the CCP has fragmented it into four municipalities under provincial jurisdiction, six administrative directorates (one of which is also incorporated into the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government), twenty-eight administrative commissioner's offices (two of which are the Longkou and Zibo Special Zone Commissioner's Offices), nine directorate-administered cities, and one hundred and seventy-seven counties. In addition, the CCP uniformly changes the original local townships and towns into administrative districts, and the original Baojia system into boards and neighborhoods, combining several households into a neighborhood, several neighborhoods into a board, and several boards (about the original several villages) into an administrative district. With novel tricks and frequent increases in official positions, everyone you meet is either a department head or bureau chief, or a director or commissioner. Everyone gets to be an official, and everyone gets to enjoy the benefits. The CCP takes advantage of the Chinese people's vanity for "reputation," not hesitating to destroy the original administrative divisions of the government in order to carry out its separatist conspiracy and ruling ambition.

### The Crisis of Our Age

— By Chuantong Xian

The Crisis of Our Age, by Sorokin

This book is a recent work by the contemporary sociological authority Pitirim Sorokin. It has been published in eight editions within three years of its release in the United States, demonstrating its significant influence. Previously, he authored the three major works "Contemporary Sociological Theories," "Social and Cultural Dynamics," and "Social Mobility," and has served as the president of the International Sociological Association and the chairman of the Department of Sociology at Harvard University. Although he is Russian, he does not support Soviet socialism. He is erudite and well-versed in both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign knowledge. This book is the essence of his previous monumental works. This article can be considered the essence of this essence.

His theme is clearly stated in his book "Social and Cultural Dynamics," where he says:

"Contemporary Western society's life, organization, and culture, in any important aspect, is facing an extraordinary crisis. Both its body and soul exhibit significant morbidity… We seem to be in the middle of two eras: one is a sensate culture with a glorious past and now dying; the other is a future, creative ideational culture. Sensate culture has had more than six hundred years of glorious history, and is now coming to an end. We are now living in this near-end sensate culture era, and our thoughts and actions are still influenced by this era. Although this dying era still has its past glory, it has reached a state of twilight brilliance. Its shadows are gradually enveloping us, making us at a loss as to how to adapt to this twilight darkness. This transitional period's night will come upon us, and we will encounter the horror of darkness. But after passing through this dark journey, we will see the dawn of a great new culture, which is the ideational culture, and it will welcome future people." The crisis of today's world is seen too simply by some, who believe that it is the same as the many crises that humanity has encountered in history, merely a number of difficulties encountered by humanity in the economic, financial, military, and political realms. Therefore, they believe that as long as humanity can improve international relations, improve economic systems, and change political situations, this crisis can be easily resolved. There are also those, like Spengler (the author of "The Decline of the West"), who believe that Western culture has reached the stage of death and is entirely beyond remedy. The author of this book believes that both views are wrong. The crisis in today's world is not just a matter of political and economic details, but a problem in the entire way of being and thinking. It is the corrosion of the entire culture. However, the corrosion of the old culture is not the complete destruction of this culture but a transformation into a new culture.

The author views the development of human culture as a cyclical cycle of three stages: (1) the ideational culture stage, which is otherworldly, transcendental, and sacred, and which enslaves the body with the soul and dominates material enjoyment with spiritual values; (2) the idealistic culture stage, which is a transitional culture, half sacred and half mundane, both soul and matter; (3) the sensate culture stage, which is worldly, mundane, and utilitarian, which advocates physical enjoyment and is enslaved by the body. For example, Greece from the 9th to the 6th century BC was an ideational culture, while Greco-Roman culture from the 4th century BC to the 4th century AD was a sensate culture; the Middle Ages were an ideational culture, and the last six hundred years have been a sensate culture. The transitional period between these two cultures is the so-called idealistic culture. This stage is very short, and the author believes that Western culture is now the demise of sensate culture, and today's crisis is the demise of Western sensate culture. This demise of sensate culture will cause Western culture to go through a short idealistic culture stage, and then produce a new ideational culture.

In this book, the author proves his theory from the developmental history of Western art, science, philosophy, religion, ethics, and law. He feels that in today's Western society, the above aspects have gradually reached the stage of ossification and corruption of sensate culture. In this stage of Western society, many morbidities have occurred. First, the increase in criminal behavior and the [text missing]; second, the prevalence of mental illness and the alarming number of suicides; third, the massacre of large-scale wars and revolutions that seize power through bloodshed; plus fourth, economic destruction and life coercion.

Modern sensate culture is facing the opportunity of disintegration, and it presents four phenomena in recent cultural dynamics: (1) disharmony and internal contradictions, for example, on the one hand, shouting for human equality, and on the other hand, showing extreme inequalities in knowledge, morality, economy, and politics; again, for example, on the one hand, wanting to pursue the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people, and on the other hand, creating unprecedented catastrophes for mankind. (2) A dazzling array of things, mixed together and not forming a unified culture. In today's Western society, we can see people simultaneously engaging in Indian opium, Turkish baths, Chinese tea, and believing in Eastern religions and philosophies, forming a chaotic kaleidoscope. (3) Only seeking quantitative growth and not caring about qualitative nobility, only seeking superficial dazzling and not caring about intrinsic value. For example, stage performances are large gatherings of hundreds of performers and musicians; schools are only full of students and staff; the quality of books depends on the number of sales; the quality of scholars depends on the number of audiences. (4) The imprisonment of creativity. In modern works, people's creative abilities are gradually invisible. Composers of the nineteenth century, such as Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and even Debussy, have not been seen in the twentieth century; nineteenth-century writers such as Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Byron, Goethe, and Balzac have not seen a shadow in the twentieth century; the same is true in other areas such as plays, painting, and sculpture. At most, there are still many contributions in mechanical engineering, but even in that aspect, there are signs of decline.

The trend of future culture is towards the ideational form. The current culture is not destroyed but only used to achieve sacred purposes. The current transitional period cannot be avoided, but we must reduce the pain it gives to people and make this period pass quickly. He said: "Man is not only an organism, but also a transmitter of 'absolute value.'... The greatest mission of culture, whether in science, technology, religion, philosophy, ethics, or art, is only the reflection and realization of this 'absolute value' in the experienced world."

### Reading "The Conquest of Happiness"

— Fan Zhilong

By Bertrand Russell, Translated by Chuan Lei, South Country Edition

This is a good book full of warmth and wisdom. The author first tells us that this book is not dedicated to erudite scholars, nor to those who use practical problems as conversation starters. It has neither profound philosophical principles nor extensive quotations. It only summarizes some reasonable opinions. The doctrines adopted are all confirmed by the author's own experience and observation, and each time he follows these doctrines, he increases his own happiness. In the current distressed and turbulent environment, everyone craves the arrival of happiness. But happiness is neither inheritance nor a gift. Happiness needs to be fought for by human beings. So this book is actually called "The Conquest of Happiness". It tells people how to fight for happiness.

In this book, it does give a lot of help to many men and women who are suffering from melancholy. With appropriate efforts, happiness can be obtained. Of course, unhappiness has various reasons. The external reasons are the material environment and the existing system, which cannot be achieved solely through individual efforts. The internal reasons are psychological problems and traditional beliefs, which are within the scope of individual ability, but are often unknown to the individual, or even unwilling to correct. Those feelings of selfishness, suspicion, anxiety, and self-indulgence can be overcome. The author tells us one by one our illnesses. He tells us that the reasons for unhappiness are self-immersion, romantic melancholy, competition, boredom and excitement, fatigue, jealousy, criminal consciousness, being abused, and fearing public opinion.

Those who are "self-immersed" put "self" in their minds at all times and in all places, and use their own interests to measure friendship, entertainment, and work. There is only one "self" in their minds, and they regard the entire world as material for building a person's own splendor, sacrificing all the elements of humanity to cultivate one element, and when cultivating their vanity to a high degree, they are not interested in anyone except themselves. As a result, they form typical morbid psychology such as guilt, self-indulgence, and narcissism.

The so-called romantic melancholy, however, is accustomed to a kind of "unhappy" pride, as if their wisdom has seen through the sincerity of the previous generation, and they feel that there is nothing in the world worth living for, and they feel all kinds of emptiness, that there is nothing new under the sun, and that people are always working, and things are always turbulent, but nothing is permanent. This kind of talented melancholy is actually due to too much leisure.

"Competition", the hard work and competition of ordinary people is not a necessary struggle for life, but actually a struggle for success. What they fear is not not having breakfast, but fearing that they will not be able to show off their power and surpass their neighbors. When asked what contribution their work can make to the public, they have nothing to answer. And their psychological state is exactly the same as that of a hundred-meter runner, but their end point is the grave. In fact, "success" can only be a component of creating happiness. If you sacrifice all the remaining components to win this one component, the price is too high. The reality of success will inevitably make people endure the torment of boredom, unless they first know how to deal with success.

"Boredom and excitement" are also unhappy psychology. The so-called "boredom" means that the status quo is in front of you, and other more pleasant situations are hovering in your imagination. So boredom is essentially a desire for accidents to happen, and what is desired is not necessarily pleasant things. The opposite of boredom is not joy but excitement. The higher we climb on the social ladder, the more intense the pursuit of stimulation becomes. As a result, anyone who is capable of pursuing it is always running around without warming their seat, forming a cycle of boredom and excitement, never having happiness. True happiness is happiness in quiet. Their joy is not the kind that others think is exciting. All great achievements must go through long-term and unremitting work, not the pursuit of excitement.

Speaking of "fatigue", a kind of mental exhaustion. This kind of fatigue is mostly caused by anxiety. Living in this tense society, it is difficult to relax the nerves, and constantly having to contact strangers will lead to constant tension. The nerves are fragmented and fall into fatigue. This kind of person is like putting a curtain between a person and the outside world. He feels that the impressions are blurred and the sounds are weak. He has no ability to pay attention to the surrounding people. He has no pleasure in food and sunshine, but just keeps thinking about some problems, which will only become more and more tired and unable to rest.

Among the many major causes of unhappiness, jealousy is the first to be eliminated. Jealousy is a bad habit, partly spiritual. It mainly comes from never looking at things from the things themselves, but from their relationships. It is certainly not happy to look at the outside world with jealousy. He knows that there are some things that are more beautiful than himself by his side, but he does not know where they are and how to find them. In despair, jealousy occupies him, and sadness and anger enter his soul. The appropriate remedy is to cultivate spiritual discipline, expand the mind, and must be able to transcend the self. Be free and unfettered by transcending the self, like the universe.

People with criminal consciousness can never be separated from the feeling of crime and feel that they are not worthy of being included in the upper class. This cannot be used as an upward call, but as a morbidity. Our traditional morality has always been an overly self-centered concept of sin, and this is an unwise part of "self-centeredness." The author believes that superstitious morality should be eliminated, and the sense of guilt should be indicated by a reasonable ethical view. Criminal consciousness not only cannot promote a good life, but leads to the opposite result. It makes people unhappy and ashamed. He harbors anger and hatred towards superior people. He will find jealousy easy and admiration difficult. He will become generally unpopular, more and more lonely, and will never have a sense of happiness.

As for "masochism"; extreme masochism is a kind of madness and a very serious disease. What is usually displayed in life is the constant feeling of being persecuted. In fact, it is because of the lack of sympathy, which makes it easy to prove that he is disgusted by the public. Or he looks too high on himself. I am fundamentally against the other party's will and give favor to people. We always have tender love and deep respect for ourselves, and we expect others to do the same to us. We never thought that we cannot expect others to treat us better than we treat others.

The last chapter is "Fearing Public Opinion": Generally speaking, everyone, except for experts, always attaches too much importance to other people's opinions. They may be enslaved by social public opinion and feel distressed. In fact, truly ignoring public opinion is a kind of power. A society full of men and women who do not bow to the world is definitely more interesting than a society where everyone acts in the same way. In places where the character of each person develops individually, there will be different types. Of course, people should not deliberately act strangely, and it is equally boring as those who are conservative and rigid. People should be natural. They should respect their innate tastes within the scope that is not fundamentally anti-social.

The above chapters are all passively attacking psychological problems and liberating a person from the prison of self-confinement. In the following chapters, the author tells us how to actively open the road to the soul and seek happiness. How to become happy people through interest, love, family, work, leisure, effort and abandonment. He writes that the secret to happiness is to expand your interests as much as possible and to make your reactions to people as friendly as possible.

Russell's book is full of warm human emotions, without preaching, and does not tell people to escape reality. On the contrary, it teaches people to face reality and liberate themselves. In this great stream of life, offer your love. He shares and breathes with people. Such a person feels that he is a citizen of the universe, freely enjoying the colors and joys provided by the world. He is not confused by death, because he feels that he is not really separated from those who come later. If you deeply merge with the long stream of life, the highest and greatest joy can be found.

Mr. Chuan Lei's translation is faithful and fluent, without any carelessness, and is quite commendable. And the simple and beautiful cover design makes people feel that the book itself is happiness.

### "Learning and Fighting"

— Written by Wang Renshu, published by Shanghai Magazine Company

Among today's youth, the enlightenment of the national self-defense war has made them understand the importance of learning theory, and they are eagerly pursuing academic knowledge. However, the thorny path of learning often presents them with many obstacles—a lack of understanding of learning methods.

This phenomenon can be said to be universally present in the hearts of a large number of young learners. This kind of painful constraint is a profound blow to learning!

However, young people do not need to be discouraged. Books that guide us on the path of learning and relieve our suffering will appear in bookstores.

Now I would like to introduce one to you.

This book, "Learning and Fighting," undoubtedly points the way for beginners! The author's writing is simple and easy to understand. Only a secondary school education is needed to understand its content. Therefore, whether you are a student or a working youth, it is suitable to take this book as a guide to preliminary study.

Summarizing the content of the book, in short, it is like this:

First, it tells beginners to start with "eating" and "digesting." The problem of digesting what you learn is indeed something that beginners must pay attention to. Otherwise, rote learning is useless.

Next, it points out that today's attitude towards learning should no longer be as a "stepping stone" or "business scripture." It also tells beginners to get out of the maze, that learning is necessary for fighting.

The author also corrects several fashionable learning maladies. At the same time, he talks about ways to take a new path, a new style and new

Finally, the author also points out "steady progress," the learning methods and direction of a giant.

In the appendix, this book presents the learning spirit of Mr. Lu Xun and his research methods for readers to refer to.

Looking at the content of this book as a whole, it is very beneficial to beginners in every way. (Na Ya)

### After Reading "A Constitutional History of the United States"

— Zhao Shichuan

"A Constitutional History of the United States" By Andrew C. Mclaughlin

Those who pay attention to the U.S. Constitution know that the basic principle of the U.S. Constitution is the separation of powers, that is, Congress exercises legislative power, the President exercises executive power, and the Supreme Court exercises judicial power. The three powers are not only separate from each other, but in fact, they check each other, which is the so-called principle of checks and balances. However, in recent years, domestic scholars discussing the presidential system often only emphasize the President's being checked by Congress, while glossing over the relationship between Congress and the judiciary. If mentioned, the position of the Supreme Court is greatly diminished, because the Supreme Court justices must be approved by the Senate of Congress, and Congress can impeach and try them to remove them from office. This view makes it difficult for us to understand the true relationship between the legislature and the judiciary. If this relationship is not clear, it is difficult to understand the entire meaning of checks and balances. Recently, I read this "A Constitutional History of the United States" and would like to briefly discuss the relationship between the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress, and its position in the constitutional development history, based on what I learned from the book.

According to the Constitution, the President may appoint Supreme Court justices with the consent of the Senate. This point we can only consider to be Congress checking the President, not checking the Supreme Court. According to the Constitution, judges (who are civil officers) can be impeached and removed from office if they commit crimes such as treason and bribery. Here we must note that although the House of Representatives can file an impeachment, only the Senate has the power to try the impeachment case. As for removal from office, it requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate members present. Although the Constitution stipulates this, in fact, impeachment cases are not common in U.S. constitutional history. There have only been two cases of impeaching judges: the first was the impeachment of John Pickering (a federal district judge in New Hampshire), but he was not a Supreme Court justice, and according to his son's claim, he actually had a mental illness, so although he was removed from office, it is not worth paying attention to. A more serious case was the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase; but the Senate trial resulted in a verdict of not guilty. Therefore, no Supreme Court justice has been impeached and removed from office in U.S. constitutional history. If we ignore the position of the Supreme Court simply because Congress has the power to impeach and try, that is very inappropriate.

Conversely, the Supreme Court can check Congress because it can review whether the laws passed by Congress are in accordance with the Constitution. Although this power is not explicitly stipulated in the Constitution, Chief Justice John Marshall laid the foundation for exercising this power in the Marbury v. Madison case (1803). In this case, Marshall declared part of the Judiciary Act (1789) passed by Congress invalid because that part authorized the Supreme Court to issue writs of mandamus, but the Constitution did not grant this power to the Supreme Court, so that part was unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court's possession of this power is very important because it can limit Congress's legislation to within the scope of the Constitution, preventing Congress from doing whatever it wants. Chief Justice Taney declared the Missouri Compromise invalid. Some of President Roosevelt's "New Deal" legislation was also deemed invalid by the Supreme Court. Therefore, although Congress can check the President, and the President can appoint judges (once judges are appointed, they serve for life, and the President has no power to remove them), Congress is checked by the Supreme Court. If we recognize the relationship between these three, then the meaning of checks and balances will be easily understood.

The Supreme Court not only checks the legislation of Congress, but also occupies the most important position in the development history of the Constitution. Especially in the early days when Marshall was Chief Justice (from 1801 to 1835), the Supreme Court's reputation and power were extremely high. At that time, the federal government had not been established for long, and there were no precedents to follow for the interpretation of the Constitution, so Marshall's meaning could be said to be the meaning of the Constitution. Fortunately, Marshall was a great judge. Although he also had biases, he had a broad vision, and his rulings almost all became the unalterable truths for interpreting the Constitution, making great contributions to the development of the country and the stability of the federal government's power.

We naturally cannot deny the greatness of the legislative and executive powers of the United States, but we should not underestimate the judicial power. At least in the history of constitutional development, the influence and contribution of the U.S. Supreme Court is far beyond what Congress and the President can compare to.

### Bertrand Russell Who Believes Education Can Transform the World

### Random Talks at Dubo

— Wu Cong

I once said to my friend Ma:

"Confucius certainly has his greatness, but according to my respectful statement, he is a person, he eats, and he farts."

However, the things that surprise me are truly many. Many so-called "some kind of expert" types often make many high-sounding arguments.

"Gorky's nose is greatly flat, Lu Xun's face is eternally swollen. Tolstoy relies entirely on his big mane, and Liebniz doesn't have a big head either? And Guo Moruo because of...because...therefore..."

So the "some kind of expert" types put on a big bow tie like Pushkin or Shakespeare, frown like Gorky, bulge their eyes like Nietzsche. Learn... go to a photo studio to take a ten-inch enlargement, and then self-admire. In addition, they praise each other, and a new Shakespeare or Pushkin is announced.

I hate obliteration the most; there is gold in the sand, the gold does not become not gold because it comes from the sand.

Similarly, it is unwise to mythologize the shortcomings of great men.

In fact, there is a strange tendency. When a person has good deeds, and his ability in a certain aspect is undeniable, not only is his few weaknesses not acknowledged, but they are especially embellished. This is really an unwise thing to do. Because once your embellishments are discovered, your reputation will unfortunately be obliterated at the same time.

I have witnessed many good generals who like to be refined and elegant, and claim that their calligraphy and literature can make them famous in the world. The result is that they waste rice paper and ink, and the lucky ones are those merchants who forge ancient paintings.

The "Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books" printed by Zhonghua Book Company and the "Wan You Wen Ku" printed by Commercial Press are said to sell very well. Because many big shots and merchants can use them as decorations in their studies.

A message to cultural merchants, there are many bulky books, there is no need to print words in the book, as long as the book cover has a name on it, it saves typesetting and ink, and if the books cannot be sold, they can be used as children's scratchpads.

In fact, to be more concise, cultural merchants can make several book boxes engraved with "Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books" or "Encyclopedia Britannica" and sell them. They can be used as elegant decorations or as clothes boxes. I think this stupid business can be done.

Schiller, in his play "Intrigue and Love," said through the mouth of Miller: "Great criminals, who themselves lose their way in a corrupt society, often use tears of love to rescue those innocent people!"

How many great people! Have walked into prison with their eyes wide open, but cannot help but shed tears, watching many kind young people walk to their side, becoming more prominent day by day.

Missionaries say. Christ took the sins of the poor and was nailed to the glorious cross. All Christ asked for was blind faith. I have never doubted Christ's greatness, but I am concerned about whether the poor can be saved.

### No Wonder

— Qi Lou

The general manager, deputy general manager, assistant manager, associate manager, etc. hold a meeting to discuss the company's business policy. In the middle of the meeting, the deputy general manager expressed some doubts about a staff member in the purchasing department.

No wonder he's been living lavishly lately.

Really?

No wonder he even made a Melton cloth coat. Where did he get the money?

No wonder he hasn't borrowed salary this month.

How can he make ends meet without borrowing salary?

No wonder he even gave a gift for your son's birthday.

Who asked him to give a gift?

No wonder he was able to get married last year.

No wonder he can even raise a son.

He has money to raise a son?

Is this the time for them to raise children?

No wonder there's often money missing from the warehouse.

No wonder there are often goods missing from the warehouse.

The company can't afford such a big loss!

He's so daring!

No wonder there's always a bit of wickedness in his eyes.

No wonder he usually doesn't dare to look me in the eye.

No wonder the company's profits last year couldn't keep up with the cost of living index.

No wonder all the employees in the company have lost weight in the past few months, except for him.

He certainly has very strong suspicions.

He is suspected of stealing money.

He is suspected of stealing goods.

No wonder he often arrives earlier than others.

No wonder he often leaves later than others.

No wonder one day I saw him alone in the office looking flustered.

No wonder the next day there was a bill that couldn't be found no matter how much we looked for it.

No wonder I once saw him take a package out.

No wonder his coat pockets were full that day.

No wonder I always felt there was a thief in the company.

No wonder I always felt that this thief was him!

The result of the meeting was that the next day the company announced the start of austerity measures, and that "thief" who was "no wonder" ate the first knife of layoffs.

### A Customer at a Coffee Shop

— Yin Bo

To say that coffee shops are places specifically for people to sip coffee is not entirely true.

Whether it's the International Building on the third floor or the fourteenth and eighteenth floors, Didi's on Avenue Joffre, Fuxing or Kafkas, or even Sassoon and Cathay on the Bund, for all the customers, few are truly leisurely there to "sip coffee" in the true sense of the word. They mostly come "for a purpose"!

If you have half a day to spare, you might as well take a tour of some famous coffee shops. That's enough for you to see.

First of all, there are those friends who talk business seriously. The so-called business, of course, refers to the broad sense, including real goods trading, but also empty-headed brokers, and even using coffee shops as temporary rental locations for "opening a can opener" and "bargaining." Some are beaming and spitting, while others are crestfallen and at a loss. They are mostly talking loudly, and even if the people around them cast surprised or even disgusted glances, they are still talking with relish, as if there were no one else around.

In terms of the second most numerous, then it is the people who use coffee shops as temporary resting places. They regard coffee shops as a station on a journey, and their function is quite similar to the ten-mile pavilion between two villages in the countryside. They either come from different places, or they come from the same place and plan to go to an even farther place together. So, at this station, they unfold the plans and aspirations for the next journey. This group of people comes and goes in a hurry, and there is no way to talk about leisure.

In addition, there are couples who borrow coffee shops as a "paradise on earth" for love affairs. Of course, there are also differences in the degree between them, from "blind dates" or introductions to getting to know each other, from initial socializing to swearing oaths of love, truly all kinds of shapes and colors, nothing is missing. As for those men and women who cannot get their fill of whispering in each other's ears, thank goodness, there are also thoughtful bosses who have arranged isolated seats for them. The Leaves Coffee Shop on Avenue Foch is calling for this.

Another type of people spend their days sitting (they call it "hatching") in coffee shops, like going to a public office. Every year, every month, regardless of wind or rain, they arrive on time. Three, four, five or six people occupy a table, set up a dragon gate formation, talking about everything from astronomy to geography, talking about politics and women. Who says they are "killing time"? That's laughable. In their own eyes, this is the most serious business.

A relatively small number of people read newspapers and listen to music in coffee shops. Of course, there are even fewer people like me who use coffee tables as writing desks to write articles. But in any case, in the end, they all come "for a purpose," so I finally think:

To say that coffee shops are places specifically for people to sip coffee is not entirely true.

### "Old Man"

— A Lu

The emperors in Chinese history really regarded the people as straw dogs - there is an anecdote about Zhu Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty notes "Jiansheng Yewen". Hongwu came from a humble background, so he should understand some "feelings of the people". But no, here's an example:

"Taizu once traveled incognito in the capital, and heard an old woman secretly call Shang 'old man'; the emperor was furious. He went to Grand Tutor Xu's house, walked around the room, and pondered endlessly. At that time, the Grand Tutor was away, and his wife was shocked, fearing that there would be other misfortunes. She kowtowed again and again, 'Is it not that the foolish husband Xu Da has committed a crime against Your Majesty?' Taizu said, 'No, madam, do not worry.' He immediately ordered the five city garrison commanders to summon all the troops and said, 'Zhang Shicheng stole Jiangdong, and the people of Wu still call him King Zhang. Now that I am the Son of Heaven, why do the residents of this country call me old man?' He immediately ordered the confiscation of many people's homes."

Because "I am the Son of Heaven," the people should compete to call "Long live." The ruling class of China has such a view. This "old woman" probably did not "come from a famous family," so she did not understand these major laws. Why did this old woman dare to call the "emperor" "old man"? Taizu asked, "Why?" He didn't wait for anyone to answer, so he "immediately" confiscated people's homes. This also shows that those officials of the "five city garrison commander and the like" were all "shocked" extremely.

### "The Golden Promise"

— Running Water

The directorial style of "The Golden Promise" is fresh and beautiful, just like that bay of lake in the male protagonist's childhood love period, implying how much warmth in the desolation.

The capture of several major characters, the young doctor of psychological therapy; the prodigal son who found a new lease on life; all have profound images. Director Sam Wood has shown extremely exquisite and moving portrayals of the characters' emotions and the surrounding atmosphere at the turning points of human relationships. Look, how excellently that young doctor of psychological therapy went to announce to his childhood companion (now a paraplegic in bed) the process of his legs being cut off, how excellently this climax was handled, how well that poem was recited, and the excited state of the three characters in the sickroom, making people unable to restrain themselves.

But the success of the script for "The Golden Promise" further helped the completeness of the entire performance. The threading of those tragic atmospheres until the final climax, but made a paraplegic strive healthily upwards, what a great transformation this is. Because this ending is powerful, it makes the characters even more emotional. The script should be praised.

Ann Sheridan, playing a worker's daughter, changed her style and washed away her past coquettish demeanor. Her road is wide, and she also performs extremely well. Robert Cummings plays a studious young student who later becomes a psychological therapist, and has always been able to maintain his simple character and identity. The final climax, persuading his companion, is also extremely refined. The other male and female actors are all excellent.

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

"Okay, let's not argue first, different people have different opinions." He still said in a very resolute tone: "In short, we businessmen have our own views. Now, I don't care about anything else, I only know how to use all my strength to transport all the goods in my hands out. You say I'm doing it for the country, you say I'm doing it for myself! I don't care! You in the cultural world have a broad vision and think it's necessary to hold a donation campaign to comfort the troops. I definitely don't object; and, with a clear conscience, you, brother, say a fair word, has Old Xu done his best? Now, you're forcing me to donate such a large amount. It's really difficult for me to help with this matter!"

In the end, he was a bit assertive.

But Zhu Zhaonian didn't give him a way to back down. This thin, tall man sat down on the long sofa again, took out a piece of candy from his pocket, peeled off the paper, and chewed happily. His gaze had been fixed on the fat Xu on the opposite side, not moving for a long time. The fat man was a little uneasy from being watched by him, and slightly turned his face, sucking on the half of a Camel cigarette hanging on the corner of his mouth unnaturally.

The room was silent for two or three minutes.

"Old Zhu, don't stare at me like that, okay?" After holding on for a while, Xu Shaoming first begged for mercy. "I'm also the kind of person who values friends the most. For your sake, I'll donate 50,000 yuan alone! This should satisfy everyone!" Saying this, he suddenly lowered his voice again. "If you, brother, want to leave in the next few days, you can come to me at any time. We have several cars going to Dushan, and it shouldn't be a problem for you alone. We're all our own people, so there's no need to talk about money!" He thought Old Zhu should be satisfied and leave.

"Thank you, I haven't thought about fleeing yet!" Old Zhu was just that ungrateful. "We're already living like refugees here; if we really want to leave Guilin, we're only fit to be refugees. It doesn't matter if we take a car or not." Old Zhu simply didn't look like he was preparing to flee.

The fat man didn't expect him to be so stubborn.

"The news hasn't been good these past few days. It's said that the Japanese have reached Lingling, and the Bai mansion and the Li mansion have all been emptied!" He wanted to try to scare him again.

"We have nothing to lose and travel light. It's still time to leave when the enemy really reaches Guilin." Old Zhu simply didn't look like he was preparing to flee.

Xu Shaoming was at a loss. (Twelve)
