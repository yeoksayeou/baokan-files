### Central Government Decides on a Lenient Policy to Handle the Unfortunate Taiwan Incident; Chairman Instructs Taiwanese Compatriots to Strictly Observe Discipline

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Concerned about the situation in Taiwan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi and others at 9:00 PM last night for a long conversation lasting one hour. He continued to meet with key personnel on the 10th. When attending the Central Memorial Week ceremony in the morning, he stated that the recent Taiwan riot was by no means a simple administrative and economic problem. The expansion of the situation was related to the Communist Party elements lurking in Taiwan, as well as former Taiwanese soldiers and sailors who had participated in the Japanese invasion in Nanyang. The government has now decided to send Minister Bai to offer condolences and handle the aftermath. Li Yizhong, chairman of the provincial party headquarters, and others will accompany him. Minister Bai summoned Li Yizhong in the morning of the 10th to inquire about the situation. He also met with representatives from six Taiwanese groups on the evening of the 10th and visited the Chairman again at 9:00 PM. Bai is expected to depart in one or two days. At the same time, the central government has decided to appoint Zhu Shaoliang to succeed Chen Yi as the chairman of Taiwan Province. This matter will be announced after Minister Bai returns from his condolence visit to Taiwan. Liu Yuqing, commander of the 21st Division, flew to Taiwan yesterday afternoon on the "Meiling" special plane with several senior staff officers from the Ministry of National Defense. In addition, another division may be sent to reinforce the defense and stationed in key areas of Taiwan to restore local order as soon as possible. It is reported that the "February 28th Incident" Handling Committee had a resolution to notify government armed forces to disarm voluntarily. Therefore, it can be seen that their intention is not limited to demanding political reforms, but is close to betraying the central government. Observers in Nanjing believe that the current situation in Taiwan should be dealt with as soon as possible to avoid further escalation. According to Li Yizhong, chairman of the provincial party headquarters, who spoke to our reporter on the 10th, the central government will handle the Taiwan incident based on the following three principles: (1) Adopt a lenient policy, dealing with everything from a broad perspective; (2) Within the scope of the Constitution, adopt the legitimate demands of the people; (3) The political system of Taiwan Province should be the same as that of other provinces in the mainland. As for the early implementation of popular elections for county magistrates, which the Taiwanese people requested to begin in June of this year, the central government is currently studying this matter.

### Government Officials to Go to Taiwan Immediately; Troops to Maintain Security Arrive in Keelung

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The central government held a memorial week for Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 10th, led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zhou Yichun reported on the general situation of the ministry's work in 1946, the Chairman gave instructions on the cause of the unfortunate incident in Taiwan and the central government's policy in dealing with it. He briefly stated: The causes of the unfortunate incident in Taiwan have been published in various newspapers and need not be described in detail. Since the recovery of Taiwan last year, the central government believed that the local order in Taiwan was good, so it did not send regular troops to station there. Local security was maintained by the military police. Over the past year, the compatriots in Taiwan's agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic circles have demonstrated a spirit of law-abiding and support for the central government, showing their patriotic spirit no less than that of compatriots in any other province. However, recently, some Taiwanese who were conscripted by Japan and sent to fight in the Nanyang area, some of whom are Communist Party members, took advantage of the crackdown on smugglers and peddlers to instigate riots and demand political reforms. As constitutional government is about to be implemented and the administration of Taiwan should return to normal as soon as possible, the central government can grant local governments the powers stipulated by the Constitution and implement them ahead of schedule. Chief Executive Chen Yi, following the instructions of the central government, has publicly announced that the governor's office will be reorganized into a provincial government, the Chief Executive's Office will be abolished, and popular elections for county magistrates will be implemented within a certain period. All Taiwanese compatriots expressed their joy and willingness to accept this. Therefore, this unfortunate incident could have come to an end. Unexpectedly, last Friday (the 7th), the so-called "February 28th Incident Handling Committee" in the province suddenly made unreasonable demands, including abolishing the Taiwan Garrison Command, surrendering weapons to be kept by the committee, and requiring that all land and naval forces in Taiwan be staffed by Taiwanese. This kind of demand has exceeded the scope of local politics, and the central government cannot recognize it. Moreover, illegal activities such as attacking government agencies have occurred one after another in recent days. Therefore, the central government has decided to send troops to Taiwan to maintain local security. It is reported that the troops sent have safely landed in Keelung last night, and the order is good. It is believed that normalcy can be restored soon. At the same time, high-ranking officials will be sent to Taiwan to assist Chief Executive Chen Yi in handling this incident. I have also strictly telegraphed the military and political personnel remaining in Taiwan to await the central government's personnel to handle the situation and not to take retaliatory actions in order to achieve love, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation among all Taiwanese compatriots. I hope that Taiwanese compatriots will understand the greater good, strictly observe discipline, not be exploited by treacherous parties, not be laughed at by the Japanese, and not act blindly, harming the country and themselves. It is hoped that they will clearly understand what is right and wrong, distinguish between what is beneficial and harmful, thoroughly awaken, take responsibility by abolishing illegal organizations, and restore local order, so that all compatriots in Taiwan Province can live and work in peace and contentment as soon as possible in order to complete the construction of a new Taiwan. Only in this way can they live up to the painful sacrifices and arduous struggles of compatriots throughout the country for fifty years to recover Taiwan.

### "February 28th" Incident Handling Committee Disbanded by Chief Executive Chen; Broadcasts to the Whole of Taiwan a Decision to Severely Punish Traitors

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] The actions of the Taiwan Provincial "February 28th" Incident Handling Committee have recently exceeded the scope of demanding political reforms and are close to rebelling against the motherland. Chief Executive Chen Yi issued an order on the 10th to disband it. Chen broadcast to the Taiwanese compatriots of the entire province at 10:00 AM, saying: "I have almost completely promised to resolve the problems of smuggling-related injuries and improve political issues that you all hope to solve, but a small number of traitors harbor treasonous conspiracies, and I am determined to severely punish them." Chen also said: "As for the relocation of the national army to Taiwan, it is to protect the people of the entire province and eliminate traitors, and there is absolutely no other intention. When people from other provinces were beaten in recent days, most of the kind Taiwanese people rescued them. This kind of righteousness comes from the pure love of compatriots. I express my heartfelt gratitude. I still hope that the kind Taiwanese people will give play to their sense of justice, love each other, and work together to build a new Taiwan." Since yesterday, the situation in Taiwan Province has become stable, and all agencies will resume work from tomorrow.

### Taiwan Garrison Headquarters Issues a Public Announcement

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] The Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters issued a public announcement on the 10th. The full text is as follows:

When the "February 28th" incident occurred, the government, in addition to handing over the personnel involved in the Monopoly Bureau incident to the court for severe punishment in accordance with the law and providing compensation for the deceased, also accommodated public opinion and accepted the proposed motions on political issues arising from the "February 28th" incident. It was meant that the incident could be brought to an end from then on, but a few war-mongering conspirators attempted to use the opportunity to seize power and betray the country. Starting from a corner of Taipei, they occupied radio stations, distorted facts, and exaggerated everything, inciting the public to riot. The sound of the incident spread throughout the province, causing chaos. As a result, administrative officials throughout the province were either held hostage or insulted, and government agencies were either occupied or destroyed. Public officials from other provinces and those who came to Taiwan for business were either robbed and killed or injured and maimed. The cruelty was so extreme that even women and children were not spared. The magnitude of the deaths and injuries is difficult to count. The evolution of the incident is unprecedented in history. The Japanese have intensified their efforts, becoming more and more intense, with their words and actions disregarding national discipline and public opinion, creating a state of anarchy. Furthermore, they advocated disarming the national army and abolishing the garrison headquarters, with their arrogance reaching the sky, almost making it impossible for Taiwan to survive without separating from China. Their betrayal of the country is obvious.

This Headquarters is ordered to command the garrison of Taiwan. All my compatriots in Taiwan should, from now on, live and work in peace, trust the government, follow the government's path to political resolution, and move together towards the path of building a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People. If anyone destroys the law, violates discipline, or acts beyond the bounds, this Headquarters, in order to stabilize the local area, will only exercise its powers and deal with it in accordance with the law without the slightest hesitation. As for those who participated in this riot, whether they were coerced or acted blindly, they may not be forgiven under the law, but there may be reasons for sympathy. If they do not alienate themselves from the people and do not fall into the clutches of the law again, they will be treated leniently.

"Taikang" Flagship Ordered to Sail to Keelung

[Our Dispatch] According to naval sources: The navy flagship "Taikang," which was ordered to go to Japan for occupation, has sailed to Taiwan to suppress the situation due to the serious turmoil in Taiwan.

### People in Rongyuan (Fuzhou) Anxious

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 10th] After the news of the disturbances in Taiwan reached here, people from all walks of life expressed their concern. The Fujian Provincial Assembly telegraphed yesterday to inquire about the truth, as Fujian and Taiwan are separated only by a narrow strip of water, and they have always been closely related. After the recovery of Taiwan, tens of thousands of public officials from Fujian crossed the sea with their families to serve in Taiwan. According to returning guests from Taipei, the largest number of casualties in this incident were public officials from Fujian. Relatives in Fujian were saddened by the news, and people were competing to inquire about the news on the streets. The telegraph office was extremely crowded, and the general reaction was somber.

### Subsidize Domestic Industry to Reduce Foreign Exchange Consumption

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It is heard that in order to prevent a large outflow of foreign exchange, the authorities recently passed a measure to assist industries that can manufacture products using domestic raw materials as much as possible through loans and other methods, so that their output can be increased to reduce the import of foreign goods. These raw materials will include cotton, tobacco, wheat, etc. In this way, the government can increase national treasury revenue on the one hand and prevent foreign exchange from being consumed on the other. In addition, my country's tariffs were generally low before the war due to Japanese pressure. Most of them are still at the pre-war standards, and it would not be entirely unreasonable to raise them in the future.

### The Responsibility for the "Zhongya" Shipwreck

It Is Rumored That It Is Related to the Discipline of the Sailors

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 10th] There is much speculation about the number of casualties in the "Zhongya" shipwreck. According to the Tongxing Company, the hull of the ship is still floating on the surface of the water. There are more than 80 missing crew members.

### Zhang Changde, Deputy Commander of the 144th Division, Executed by Firing Squad for Gathering Crowds for Rebellion and Insurrection and Colluding with the Enemy

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Changde, deputy commander of the 144th Division of the 50th Army of the Army, was stationed in Qingyang, Tongling, Nanling, and other counties in Anhui Province with his troops in the spring of 1944. The central government removed Tang Ming from his position as commander of the 144th Division and reassigned Bai Liang to fill the position. Zhang then colluded with his subordinates and telegraphed the central government to withdraw the order and refused to hand over the command. A team was sent to disarm them, but Zhang resisted with his troops, occupying the areas of Qingyang, Tongling, Nanling, and Fanchang in Anhui, arbitrarily changing the designation, calling himself the commander-in-chief of the Independent Army Corps, and concurrently serving as the pseudo-administrative chief of the Southern Anhui Special Zone. On September 1, 1944, he ordered the subordinate pseudo-administrative office to purchase grain and rice for the enemy's army corps. After the enemy surrendered, the First Disciplinary Inspection Group of the former Military Commission verified the facts, submitted them to the Chairman, and telegraphed the Chongqing Executive Headquarters to detain the criminal. The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense organized a collegial trial. Based on Zhang Changde's acts of betraying the party and the country, gathering crowds for riots, and colluding with the enemy, he was sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life. Upon approval of the Chairman, the sentence was carried out. On the afternoon of the 10th, the criminal was identified, tied to the Yuhua Platform execution ground, and executed by firing squad.

### Taiwanese Compatriots All Willing to Serve the Motherland; Unfortunate Incident Should Be Resolved Quickly

— Representatives of Six Taiwanese Groups Host Journalists in Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Representatives from six Taiwanese groups, including the Taiwan Provincial Construction Association, hosted a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 10th to report on the truth of the "228" Incident and the requests of Taiwanese compatriots to the government. The representatives unanimously expressed their support for the policies announced today by Chairman Chiang at the National Government regarding the handling of the Taiwan incident. However, they hoped that the reasonable demands of the Taiwanese compatriots could be adopted by those in power, and denied that the incident was instigated by undesirable elements as a planned act of resistance against the central government.

After the reception began, Yang Jiachun first delivered a speech, explaining how eagerly Taiwanese compatriots looked forward to the motherland at the beginning of Taiwan's recovery. At that time, all six million compatriots in the area wished to contribute their strength to the work of the motherland's revival. However, in the past year and six months, Chief Executive Chen's various measures were difficult for Taiwanese compatriots to accept. Chen could hardly shirk responsibility for the consequences of today. Yang firmly denied that the incident was instigated by "undesirable elements" and did not believe that its purpose was to "resist the central government." Yang stated in an impassioned tone, "After Japan surrendered, Taiwan was a clean land. I can guarantee with my life that Taiwanese compatriots all obey the central government." Finally, he earnestly hoped that the voices of the six million compatriots could reach the central government and that the incident could be resolved soon.

Then, Chen Bisheng reported on the course of the incident and the issue of responsibility. He also severely criticized Chief Executive Chen's measures in Taiwan and deeply regretted that the points raised in the petition to the central government last year against special treatment had not been adopted. Chen explained that they deeply supported Chairman Chiang's policy on handling the Taiwan incident, which was announced at the National Government's memorial week today. However, he solemnly stated two points: 1. This incident was entirely an automatic resistance erupted by the people due to their inability to bear Chief Executive Chen's policies. It had absolutely no background and was not a planned action. 2. Taiwanese compatriots have always loved the motherland and always considered themselves a part of the Republic of China, and recognized Taiwan as a part of the motherland's territory. There was absolutely no resistance to the central government or exclusion of compatriots from other provinces. Chen did not deny that a small number of undesirable elements with ulterior motives may have mixed in. However, he said that this was only an extremely small number.

Dispatch Senior Officials to Handle the Aftermath Quickly

Chen hoped that the government would prioritize leniency and the overall situation, and seriously handle the incident. Sending troops to Taiwan would easily lead to misunderstandings. He hoped that senior officials could be dispatched to Taiwan quickly to announce comfort, handle the aftermath, and restore order. He also said that since the Chief Executive's Office will have to be abolished sooner or later, it should be abolished as soon as possible. Finally, Wang Liming and others also delivered speeches one after another, detailing the hopes of the Taiwanese compatriots. After the reception, Pang Bangjie and others went to visit Minister Bai Chongxi to discuss the Taiwan incident.

Illegal Demands of the Handling Committee

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] In addition to passing 32 articles of political reform proposals, the Taiwan Provincial "228" Incident Handling Committee also passed a motion to "temporarily disarm the government's armed forces in various locations." After this news was published by local newspapers, it was generally believed that the committee's motives were no longer entirely for demanding political improvement, but were attempting to betray the country. Although the committee issued a statement on the 8th, saying that because of the large number of people attending the meeting at the time, it was not possible to consider everything carefully. For example, the abolition of the Garrison Headquarters and the disarmament of the National Army were close to rebelling against the central government and were definitely not the public opinion of the provincial people. However, at 10:30 PM on the same day, rioters attacked the Eastern Gate Garrison Headquarters, the Yuanshan Naval Office, and the Huashancho Police Station, attempting to force the government's armed forces to disarm. The government believes that the military is the country's military, so it re-imposed martial law starting at 6:00 AM on the 9th and temporarily placed transportation and telecommunications agencies under military control. The Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters also issued a notice this morning stating: "Starting from the 10th, all illegal groups will be abolished and gatherings and demonstrations will be prohibited." The headquarters also stipulated that all civilian-owned firearms must be registered with the headquarters immediately, and severe punishment will be imposed if found.

American Officials Fly to Taiwan for Inquiry

[Another Dispatch] Military Attaché Colonel Dodd of the American Embassy paid visits to Chief Executive Chen Yi and Staff Officer Huang Ke Yuanfen of the Garrison Headquarters at 10:00 AM today. Dodd arrived in Taiwan yesterday morning at 10:00 AM on a military plane from Shanghai. It is reported that when he spoke with Chief Executive Chen, he expressed his personal impression of the current situation regarding the recent disturbance, saying, "The current situation here is extremely stable, the order is good, and the lives and property of American expatriates are also safe and guaranteed." Dodd returned to Shanghai on the original plane this afternoon.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] It was rumored in this city that the Taiwan Chief Executive's Office was also surrounded by rioters. This statement has not been confirmed. The telecommunications contact between the Taiwan Administrative Office and its Shanghai Liaison Office has been cut off since 5:00 PM on the 9th, and has not yet been restored at the time of publication. However, according to Manager Xie of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Taiwan, the rumor that the head office of the Bank of Taiwan was destroyed by rioters on the night of the 9th is absolutely unreliable. The Shanghai Branch of the Head Office received a message from the Bank of Taiwan yesterday afternoon reporting that everything was safe and sound. Most Taiwanese people expressed extreme dissatisfaction. Chief Executive Chen Yi was originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing before the Third Plenary Session to report on his work, but now, at the request of local gentry, he has decided to postpone the trip indefinitely and continue to be stationed to maintain order.

It was also rumored that the Taipei branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was occupied by Taiwanese. Deputy General Manager Hu Shiyuan of the company said that the Taipei branch of the company sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday afternoon reporting that everything was safe and sound, which seems to be a false rumor.

According to responsible parties at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the company's Shanghai-Taiwan money transport ships are still sailing as usual, and all telecommunications have not been interrupted.

[Another Dispatch] The "Zhongxing" and "Tainan" ships that sailed to Taiwan after the "228" Incident have both arrived safely. However, because local order has not been fully restored, all people from other provinces have not gone ashore in order to ensure the safety of their lives and goods, and will return on the original ships. It is reported that the Zhongxing will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 12th).

### Progress in Negotiations on Government Reorganization; People's Socialist and Youth Parties Will Not Participate in Technical Departments; Jiang Yuntian Flies to Hong Kong; Lei Zhen Changes Return to Nanjing Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Negotiations on the reorganization of the government have now entered the stage of personnel coordination. According to a government official, although the negotiations on the participation of various parties in various departments have not reached the final decision, it is generally known that the People's Socialist and Youth Parties will not participate in technical departments due to a lack of talent. As for the departments they will participate in, it was originally planned to adopt an exchange system for the ministers and vice ministers of each department. However, due to many personnel disputes in political circles, it is currently possible to decide that the minister and vice minister belong to one party. It is also untrue that the Youth Party will take over the Ministry of Judicial Administration.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Jiang Yuntian of the People's Socialist Party flew to Hong Kong on the 10th to invite Li Daming and Wu Xianzi, who are in Hong Kong. Jiang guaranteed to government officials that he could fly to Shanghai with Li and Wu on the original plane on the 11th. The party will then convene a Central Standing Committee meeting to make a final decision on participating in the government, and then come to Nanjing. It is heard that if Jiang's words are realized, the date of the reorganization of the government will not be far away. Zhang Junmai has also agreed to participate in the government.

[Our Dispatch] The People's Socialist Party's full participation in the government still needs to be decided after the two Standing Committee members left in Hong Kong arrive in Shanghai. According to an official, Wu Xianzi sent a telegram to Shanghai around the 7th, saying that it was difficult to leave Hong Kong in the short term, and hoping to consider full participation after the Third Plenary Session. The government hopes that Jiang Yuntian will go to Hong Kong immediately to welcome Wu Xianzi and Li Daming to Shanghai as soon as possible, so as not to delay the reorganization of the government for too long. Therefore, Jiang Yuntian left Shanghai for Hong Kong yesterday. It is heard that Wu Xianzi is quite insistent on the simultaneous opening of local political power, which is quite close to the Youth Party's proposal. Hu Haimen and Liang Qiushui, the northern representatives of the People's Socialist Party, will arrive in Shanghai on the 12th.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The People's Socialist Party's internal opinions on the issue of participating in the government have not been unified, but there is no phenomenon of external division. The party's Vice Chairman Wu Xianzi stayed in Hong Kong and did not return because his private affairs were not finished. He and Li Daming believe that the reorganization of local governments is as important as the reorganization of the central government, which is not significantly different from the views of other people. Liang Qiushui and Hu Haimen from the north have not expressed their intention to leave the party. Unless there is an accident, the two will arrive in Shanghai in a few days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Hong Lanyou returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th. It was rumored that Hong would be the Minister of the Interior, but Hong denied it.

[Our Dispatch] Secretary-General Lei Zhen was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing last night, but he decided to postpone it for one day because his mission in Shanghai was not completed.

### Shao Lizi Returns to Nanjing

[Our Dispatch] Shao Lizi and his wife took the night train back to Nanjing yesterday. Before leaving, he presided over the groundbreaking ceremony of the Denghui Hall of Fudan University. He mostly avoided answering the questions raised by reporters. Shao said that he only spoke to Lei Zhen once on the phone yesterday and had no other activities. When asked if the government was no longer trying to resolve the CCP issue through political means, he replied: When the situation permits, the government is still willing to resolve it through political methods. When asked about his feelings about the disturbances in Taiwan, he said that he could only answer in eight words: "Too many things to say, no way to start." Regarding Zhou Enlai's recent speech, Shao said: "Too busy, didn't read the newspaper."

### Jiang Tingfu Will Go to the United States to Teach This Autumn; Denies That He Will Be Sent to the United States

[This City Dispatch] Former Director of the Executive Yuan, Jiang Tingfu, met with a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday and denied the rumors that he would be sent to the United States. He also said that he would go to the United States to teach this autumn for a year and then return to China. Since leaving his position as Director of the Executive Yuan, Jiang has been writing books behind closed doors. He recently completed an English version of his autobiography, which will be published in the United States. The book describes his childhood life in the countryside of Hunan, his experiences studying in the United States, and his administrative and diplomatic experiences after graduation. There are more than a dozen parts, and a Chinese version will be published in the future.

### Five Air Routes to Be Opened Between China and the United Kingdom According to the Civil Aviation Agreement; Connecting London, Singapore, Borneo, and Hong Kong

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 10th] It is heard that the Sino-British Civil Aviation Agreement will include five air routes, two from China to the United Kingdom. One will reach London via India, Myanmar, North Africa, and other places, and the other will reach London via Japan, the United States, and other places. The above two lines are reciprocal in nature. The other two are Southeast Asian lines, one ending in Singapore and the other ending in Jesselton, Borneo. The last one is the Shanghai-Hong Kong line. It is heard that our side initially believed that there was no need to open a new line between Shanghai and Hong Kong. After several consultations, it was decided to open the route, but the capacity and schedule will be restricted. In addition to the above five lines that have been agreed upon, the two sides are continuing to negotiate the opening of two other lines. As for the Chinese airports that will be used in the future, there will be four locations: Kunming, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin. It is reported that the biggest difference between the Sino-British Aviation Agreement and the Sino-American Aviation Agreement is that (1) if there are disputes between China and the United Kingdom, they will not be submitted to international conferences but will be resolved through mutual consultation; (2) the Sino-British Aviation Agreement has no time limit. If one of the contracting parties deems it necessary, it can notify the other party to cancel it.

### Air France Plans to Open a Hong Kong-Vietnam Air Route

[United Press, Paris, 10th] Air France announced today that it plans to open a new air route between Hong Kong and Indochina. It is currently negotiating with the Chinese government to allow the company to fly and land in Guangzhou and Hainan Island.

### Ministry of the Interior Compiles Population Statistics

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Population statistics are closely related to the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators. However, the years of statistics from the Ministry of the Interior are not consistent, and the investigating agencies are also different. Relevant parties worry that inaccurate figures will be adopted. It is better to compile a "reasonable" statistical table based on various available figures. This work is being compiled by the Ministry of the Interior and other agencies and will be completed in a few days.

### Revising Foreign-Related Laws; Legislative Yuan Sends Wu Shangying and Others Abroad to Investigate Foreign Legislation for Reference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] After the abolition of unequal treaties, various foreign-related laws in our country need to be revised. However, when carrying out this work, it is felt that it is necessary to refer to foreign legislation. At the same time, the actual situation in our country should also be made clear to each country in order to avoid conflicts during future implementation. For this reason, the Legislative Yuan decided to send Secretary-General Wu Shangying, Legislator Zhang Zhaoyuan, and Sheng Zhenwei to inspect various groups in the United Kingdom and the United States. Wu and the other two will depart after the Third Plenary Session.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The 317th meeting of the Fourth Legislative Yuan will be held at 9:00 AM on the 11th in the Legislative Yuan to discuss general routine cases. As for various cases related to the constitution and regulations, a series of four meetings will be held at the end of the month to submit them to the General Assembly for discussion.

### Chen Zhiping Replies to Philippine Note, Clarifying Our Attitude Towards the Philippines; Never Intended to Control Any Neighboring Country

[United Press, Manila, 10th] Chinese Minister to the Philippines Chen Zhiping sent a note to Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino today regarding the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty, stating: "The situation hindering our negotiations has not seen significant improvement." The note Chen submitted today was a reply to Quirino's note, stating: China does not intend to request any special conveniences, such as those that the United States may enjoy in the Philippines. This is not a problem in the treaty. China has never intended to control any neighboring country politically or economically. There is no reason for your statement that the Philippine government "cannot abandon national interests to comply with the wishes of other countries." China has been striving to abolish unequal treaties for decades. It is unimaginable to say that China now intends to force unfavorable treaties on friendly countries.

### Menon Visits Foreign Minister Wang

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Menon, the first Indian Ambassador to China, visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie this afternoon, making his first visit since arriving in Nanjing. In addition, Hua Linzhe, a counselor at the British Embassy in China, has been promoted to Director of the British Foreign Office and will return to his country in a few days.

### Ministry of National Defense Issues Order Strictly Prohibiting Soldiers from Marrying Foreign Women

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Ministry of National Defense telegraphed an order strictly prohibiting soldiers from marrying foreign women as wives in order to comply with regulations. For those who have already married foreign women, in order to take into account the facts, they are allowed to apply for Chinese nationality in accordance with the Nationality Law recently promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and their actions should be closely monitored.

### Unwarranted Worry; American Scholar Worries That Our Population Increase Will Inevitably Lead to Territorial Expansion After Decades

[United Press, Los Angeles, 10th] Professor Witt of Stanford University said at a meeting here last night that population restriction is closely related to economic stability, so American assistance to China and India should depend on the two countries' control of fertility. Currently, the population of the Americas and Europe has not increased much in quantity, but the population of China, the Soviet Union, and India is increasing sharply. If China's population continues to increase at a rate of 15%, then in 1980, China's population will increase from the current 400 million to 700 million. Improving agriculture and industry is not enough to cope with this population increase, which will inevitably lead to ambition to expand territory.

### Tani Hisao, the Main Culprit of the Nanjing Massacre, Sentenced to Death; The Judgment Was Served in Court After It Was Read Out

[Our Nanjing and Tianjin Dispatch, 10th] Tani Hisao, the main culprit of the Nanjing Massacre, was sentenced to death at the Nanjing Temporary Public Court in Lizhi Society this afternoon. Chief Judge Shi and others appeared in court on time. Soon, the convict Tani was brought to court. Tani was still wearing his old clothes. From beginning to end, his expression was calm and he showed no signs of panic. First, Chief Judge Shi asked his name and origin, and then read the judgment, which was immediately translated into Japanese. Tani did not change his expression after hearing the words "death penalty." The judgment took as long as forty minutes to read. The convict Tani requested that a Japanese judgment be issued at the end, but his request was not granted. The judgment was served today, and it was announced that Tani could appeal to our commander within ten days in accordance with the law. After approval, it would be returned for a retrial, otherwise it would be executed in accordance with the law. The main text is recorded as follows: "During the occupation of Nanjing, Tani Hisao jointly allowed his troops to kill prisoners and non-combatants, and raped, plundered, and destroyed property. He is sentenced to death."

Key Points of the Judgment

Facts: Tani Hisao is a brave and good general among Japanese warlords. When the Sino-Japanese War began in 1937, he served as the commander of the Sixth Division. At the end of the year, he led his troops to China to participate in the war of aggression. He first fought in the Yongding River in Hebei and Baoding and Shijiazhuang. At the end of November of the same year, the battles along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) line were frequently lost, and he moved to defend Nanjing. The Japanese military believed that our capital was the center of resistance, so they gathered their elite troops, including the fierce Sixth Division led by Tani Hisao, the 16th Division led by Nakajima, the 18th Division led by Ushijima, and the 114th Division led by Suematsu, under the command of General Matsui Iwane, and jointly attacked. In addition to the anger caused by the strong resistance of our army, they carried out a planned massacre after the city fell to show revenge. The Sixth Division led by Tani Hisao took the lead and captured Zhonghua Gate on the evening of December 12, 1937 (the tenth day of the eleventh lunar month). The vanguard troops climbed the walls with rope ladders and began to massacre. The next morning, he led a large army into the city and divided into various areas of Nanjing City with the troops of Nakajima, Ushijima, and Suematsu to launch a large-scale massacre, followed by burning and looting.

Killing

The most tragic period of the massacre was from December 12 to December 21, 1937, that is, during the period when Tani Hisao's troops were stationed in Nanjing. In Huashen Temple, Shita Bridge, Shiguanyin, Xiaguan, and Caoxie Gorge outside Zhonghua Gate, our captured soldiers and civilians were collectively shot by Japanese troops with machine guns and their bodies were cremated to destroy the evidence. There were more than 190,000 people. In addition, the bodies of more than 150,000 people were collected by charitable organizations for scattered massacres. The total number of victims reached more than 300,000. The area was covered with corpses, which was extremely tragic. The cruel situation cannot be described in words. For example, at 1:00 PM on December 15, more than 2,000 of our soldiers and police were captured by the Japanese army and escorted to Hanzhongmenwai, where they were densely swept with machine guns and died. Those who were wounded and did not die were all burned alive. At 6:00 PM on the 16th, more than 5,000 refugees from the Overseas Chinese Reception Center were escorted by Japanese soldiers to the Zhongshan Wharf in the port. Those who could still struggle were stabbed to death with random knives, and all the corpses were poured with coal oil and burned. For example, on December 12, a rural woman named Wang Xu was beheaded and burned by Japanese troops at Xiama Wharf outside Zhonghua Gate. On the 13th, a villager named Wei Xiaoshan was砍死 (kan si: beheaded to death) by Tani Hisao's troops because he went to put out the fire in the grass alley of Zhonghua Gate. On the same day, monks Longjing and nuns Zhenxingdeng and Gaodengyuan were also slaughtered in the temple outside Zhonghua Gate. On the 14th, a citizen named Yao Jialong took his family to Zhonghua Gate Zhanlong Bridge to take refuge, and his wife was raped and killed by Japanese troops. His eight-year-old son and three-year-old daughter cried beside him and were picked up with bayonets and thrown into the fire, burned alive. From the 13th to the 17th of the same month, when it was very cold, the Japanese troops stationed outside Zhonghua Gate ordered more than 30 villagers to go into the water to catch fish. Those who followed were frozen, and those who disobeyed were遭到戰 (zao dao zhan: met/suffered with war). An old man was tied and hung on a tree branch and used as target practice with guns. He fell to his death when the rope broke. Two Japanese officers competed to kill people. One killed 105 people, and the other won by killing 106 people. On the 19th of the same month, a rural woman named Xie Shanzhen, who was over sixty years old, was划殺 (hua sha: slashed to death) by Japanese troops with knives in Dongyue Temple outside Zhonghua Gate, and bamboo poles were inserted into her private parts, all of which were inhumane. It is estimated that from December 12 to December 17, 886 cases of innocent soldiers and civilians in our capital were brutally killed by Japanese troops and have been recorded. In addition to the above-mentioned cases, there were 378 cases of Wang Fuhe, Ke Dacai, Chu Weng, etc. who were killed in the Zhonghua Gate area. (To be continued)

### Military Law Criminals Sentenced to Death Can Get Reduced Sentence

Limited to Those Who Committed Crimes Before the End of Last Year

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Ministry of National Defense recently telegraphed to inform the provinces, counties, cities, and military organs at all levels that if a military law criminal whose death sentence has been approved by the Ministry of National Defense committed a crime before December 31, 1946, and the case meets the requirements for a reduced sentence, the execution should be stopped immediately and the sentence should be reduced in accordance with the law.

### Measures for Surrendered Imposter Lawyers Who Were Wanted to Resume Business

Promulgated by the Ministry of Judicial Administration

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Ministry of Judicial Administration has stipulated that although there are regulations restricting the resumption of business for general imposter lawyers, some imposter lawyers have been wanted. How to deal with them is a matter of doubt for local courts. Recently, special measures have been stipulated to inform and notify. If an imposter lawyer is wanted for performing duties in a false court without other crimes, he can, after the expiration of the suspension period, obtain a letter of guarantee from two or more officers of the recommended rank and go to the local court in person to surrender. After investigation and confirmation, he will be allowed to transfer the request to revoke the wanted status and allow him to register and resume business. In addition, the deadline for imposter lawyers to apply for re-employment and reissue new certificates was originally the end of 1946, but it has now been extended to the end of March 1947.

### County Governments Concurrently Handling Military Law to End Before the End of April

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently ordered the High Courts in various places to inform that the system of administrative offices in pacification areas concurrently handling military law has been decided to be abolished. County governments should end the concurrent handling of military law business before the end of April and stop accepting new cases from now on.

### Huayuankou Starts to Close; Diversion River Simultaneously Releases Water; Water Flow Has Passed Liuyuankou

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] The closing project of the Huayuankou gate and the release of water from the diversion river began on the evening of the 8th. This is the result of discussions at a meeting held by the Bureau of Restoration. At the moment, the breach has been reduced to 15 meters. The water level upstream of the breach has been raised by about 2 meters. The water flow entering the new diversion river has reached one-fourth of the total river. The side dam on the south side of the main dam is being backfilled. Several more spur dams have been built next to the side dam to reduce the pressure of the backwater from the sinking part. The arc-shaped surrounding dam on the north side of the gate is also being retreated from the east and west ends.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 10th] After the diversion river in the old course of the Yellow River released water, Yongtou flowed through Liuyuankou on the evening of the 9th. The old course of Liuyuankou is now about 2 li wide and 4 meters deep, and the water is quite turbulent. Song Tong, Director of the Henan Construction Department, inspected the water flow at Huayuankou from 2:00 PM on the 10th. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission also sent personnel to inspect.

### Strange Plane Discovered Over Construction Site

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] A strange plane flying from the northwest direction was suddenly discovered over the Huayuankou dam construction site at around 11:00 AM on the 10th. After circling twice, it flew to the southeast. When it flew to the west weir for the second time, it flew very low. The workers on the construction site were disturbed and dispersed. Work was suspended for two hours before it returned to normal.

Editorial

### Review of the Shanghai Municipal Government Organization Regulations

Since the Shanghai Municipal Government Organization Regulations were passed by the Executive Yuan and disclosed in various newspapers, they have attracted considerable attention due to the significant streamlining of the organization, which will reduce the number of personnel under the Municipal Government from over 3,300 to over 1,900, having a major impact. In fact, the number of personnel is only one aspect of the issue; another aspect, the adjustment of the functions and powers of various bureaus, is even more noteworthy. A comparison of the functions and responsibilities of each bureau under the current system and the new system is presented below, item by item, recording the additions, subtractions, and changes for discussion.

First, the following are items not included in the current system but added to the new system:

Civil Affairs Bureau (formerly the Civil Affairs Office) adds: (1) Matters concerning the demarcation of municipal areas; (2) Matters concerning etiquette, customs, and religion (originally under the Social Affairs Bureau); (3) Matters concerning the prohibition of opium and drugs (previously without explicit regulations).

Finance Bureau adds: (1) Matters concerning the operation and management of public enterprises; (2) Matters concerning assistance with national tax collection.

Education Bureau adds: Music, drama, film, broadcasting, and other aesthetic education (mostly originally under the Social Affairs Bureau).

Social Affairs Bureau adds: Matters concerning the New Life Movement. This matter was originally under the bureau's jurisdiction, but without explicit regulations.

Land Administration Bureau adds: Matters concerning the disposal of public land, also originally under the bureau's jurisdiction, but without explicit regulations.

Health Bureau adds: (1) Matters concerning health education and training of health personnel; (2) Matters concerning vital statistics; (3) Matters concerning the inspection and analysis of bacteria, diseases, and pharmaceutical chemistry; (4) Matters concerning the supervision of municipal hospitals, infectious disease hospitals, and health clinics and other institutions.

Public Works Bureau adds: (1) Matters concerning the management of ships and aircraft; (2) Matters concerning agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, fisheries, and animal husbandry (originally under the Social Affairs Bureau).

Police Bureau adds: (1) Matters concerning investigation and suppression; (2) Matters concerning assistance with military service and household registration.

Second, the following are items listed separately in the current system but not included in the new system:

Finance Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the supervision and direction of municipal banks; (2) Matters concerning the investigation and adjustment of the city's economy.

Education Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning vocational education; (2) Matters concerning national physical education and health education.

Social Affairs Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration; (2) Matters concerning factory inspections; (3) Matters concerning the protection and regulation of afforestation, land reclamation, animal husbandry, and hunting; (4) Matters concerning the management of books, newspapers, films, and theater; (5) Matters concerning the supervision and direction of religion and the improvement of customs.

Land Administration Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the supervision of real estate brokers; (2) Matters concerning the improvement of public land, the cultivation of wasteland, and the management and promotion of agricultural and forestry experimental fields.

Health Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the inspection and management of food and drink, and the supply of pharmaceuticals, instruments, serums, and vaccines for the entire city; (2) Matters concerning the disposal of garbage and excrement.

Public Works Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the investigation and design of urban planning; (2) Matters concerning the registration, examination, and regulation of technicians and manufacturers, and the issuance of licenses; (3) Matters concerning the establishment of engineering standards and the inspection of materials.

Public Utilities Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the supervision and guidance of water, land, and air transportation, but adds an item on vehicle traffic inspection, which may be included; (2) Matters concerning the planning and management of wharves and warehouses; (3) Matters concerning the registration, licensing, examination, and regulation of water, land, and air transportation drivers and water, electricity, and gas technicians and manufacturers; (3) Matters concerning the construction and management of streetlights, standard clocks, and municipal radio stations; (4) Matters concerning the establishment and implementation of equipment standards, service standards, and fee prices for public utilities.

Police Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the establishment and alteration of police districts; (2) Matters concerning the investigation of special households and foreign affairs police; (3) Matters concerning the investigation of criminal cases.

Formally speaking, the Health Bureau has undergone the most changes. Not only do its functions and responsibilities differ greatly from the current system, but they are also completely different from the recently approved Nanjing Municipal Organization. It does not resemble other bureaus, which largely copied the established rules of the Nanjing Municipal Organization Regulations. Substantively, the streamlining of the Social Affairs Bureau is the most obvious. For example, agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, fisheries, and animal husbandry are assigned to the Public Works Bureau; religion and etiquette are assigned to the Civil Affairs Office; and film and theater are assigned to the Education Bureau. It is unclear where agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration, factory inspection matters, and book and newspaper management matters will be assigned. Furthermore, the New Life Movement, aimed at changing customs, is clearly a matter of etiquette, but it is not incorporated into the Civil Affairs Office. Instead, a special item is added to the Social Affairs Bureau, which is also difficult to understand. Some say that democracy is now being implemented, and in the future, large-scale books and newspapers will not be managed, which naturally makes sense. However, is it also proportional to let factory inspection and all agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration go unmanaged? It is impossible not to doubt. When the Shanghai Municipal Government was first established, there was a Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce, which was later merged with the Bureau of Public Welfare and renamed the Social Affairs Bureau. This was the beginning of the Social Affairs Bureau in China. Is this city the only major industrial and commercial port in the country? We do not believe that this administration can be completely abandoned in the future. Others say that various ministries have established offices in Shanghai, and perhaps they will be taken over and managed by the central government, without the need for local management, which is also a way of saying it. Moreover, at a time when the city's finances are extremely difficult and there is a great need to reduce personnel and administration, there may also be considerable reasons. However, according to this example, what else can be taken over and managed by the central government other than agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration? And which city other than Shanghai is applicable to this example?

Garbage and excrement disposal is a very heavy task for the Health Bureau, and it is also a large source of income and expenditure. Whether it is government-run or commercially run, the principle has only recently been approved by the Senate. The new system also completely removes it, and we do not know what the intention is. We do not believe that this matter can also be interpreted as being taken back and managed by the Central Health Administration. As for agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, fisheries, and hunting, is it a bit too far-fetched to include them all under the Public Works Bureau? It is really not easy to understand. Health education has been included in the Health Bureau, which is understandable. However, it is worth studying whether vocational education can be completely omitted. The most incomprehensible thing is that the central government has repeatedly issued orders to promote national compulsory labor, but it is not mentioned in the new system. We do not know which department should handle it. After the winding up of the handling committee, many parties concerned bumped into each other and could not find a competent authority. The new system also does not mention it, which also seems to be a shortcoming.

According to strict legal procedures, this organizational regulation must also be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. It is hoped that these issues can be appropriately remedied during the legislative process.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Opens in Snowstorm Molotov Serves as Chairman Marshall Expresses Determination to Promote Four-Power Treaty

[Report from our agency] Paris, 10th, broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference opened at 5:00 PM today (Moscow time, 10:00 PM Shanghai time) in a snowstorm. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov served as chairman, and the ceremony was simple. The foreign ministers arrived by car at the Soviet Aviation Industry Building (two miles from the Kremlin). Marshall arrived first, followed by Bevin and Bidault.

[Report from our agency] San Francisco, 10th, broadcast: The foreign ministers of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom held an informal meeting today before the conference to exchange views. First, Marshall met with Bevin, and this morning Bidault also visited Marshall for an hour-long conversation. The agenda of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has not yet been decided, but Marshall revealed several key points in his talk this morning: (1) The US policy in this conference will be based on the clauses related to Germany in the Potsdam Agreement and the principles in Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart; (2) The US is determined to continue its efforts to promote the conclusion of a four-power forty-year treaty to prevent Germany from rising again to aggression; (3) The Austrian peace treaty will be discussed in advance. As for whether the Chinese question will be discussed, Marshall declined to answer.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 10th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received US Secretary of State Marshall this afternoon for an initial courtesy call.

[United Press, Moscow, 10th] The venue for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be the Aviation Club outside Moscow. The Soviet Union had kept it extremely secret in advance, so that the Western delegations were still unable to confirm the location of today's meeting on Sunday night. The full name of the Aviation Club is the "Soviet Aviation Industry Building." In the Tsarist era, this was a gorgeous Gypsy dance area.

This is Marshall's first time participating in the Four-Power Conference and his visit to Moscow, so he maintains a quiet and solemn, even cold, attitude. He only received Bevin last night. This is Marshall's first major test since taking office as Secretary of State. The focus of the disputes in the coming weeks will be on him more than anyone else. He promised to implement the policies pursued by his predecessor Byrnes, but these policies will be Marshall's tactics not only towards the Soviet Union, but also towards Britain and France, which occupy important positions. At the same time, Marshall was the first to sing a cautious and optimistic tune. Although he warned of great difficulties ahead, he predicted that these difficulties would be resolved through peaceful negotiations. However, many of the representatives of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom expressed pessimism.

### Main Objectives of the Conference Four Documents Will Be the Basis for Discussion

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 10th] The main objectives of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference are as follows:

"Soviet Union"——Requests the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement, four-power joint management of Germany, but at the same time there must be a unified Germany.

"United States"——Hopes to conclude an agreement in accordance with the path prescribed by former Secretary of State Byrnes to ensure that Germany is permanently disarmed.

"United Kingdom"——Hopes that the Moscow Conference will help extend the validity of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty to fifty years.

"France"——Joint management of the Ruhr industrial area. If the four countries cannot resolve all of the above issues, they may be able to reach a substantial agreement.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] Observers here recently commented on the future work of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, saying: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be extremely difficult at the beginning, and it is difficult to expect it to achieve rapid results. The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will have four documents as the starting point and basis for its discussion, namely (1) the draft peace treaty with Austria. The four countries' resolutions previously achieved at the London Conference were far greater than other issues, so if the four foreign ministers can quickly reach an agreement on several pending issues (such as guaranteeing Austria's independence and the method of handling German assets in the border area), then the peace treaty is very likely to be drafted during the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and may even be signed in Moscow.

(2) The report submitted by the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on the procedures for drafting the peace treaty with Germany. There are many different opinions on this issue, which are difficult to resolve, especially regarding the manner in which countries without representatives attending the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will participate in the drafting of the peace treaty with Germany. Opinions are quite divided. (3) The report submitted by the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on the opinions of the allied countries other than the four powers on the German question. (4) The report submitted by the Allied Control Council for Germany, which reviews the work of the four powers in the occupied areas of Germany from Germany's surrender to February 1947. This report was originally jointly drafted by the four powers to show that each occupied area implemented the unified principle of the Potsdam Agreement, but the four occupied areas each implemented the principle of the agreement differently for various reasons, especially because of fundamental misunderstandings about the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement. The main points of this difference are (1) measures to disarm Germany and eliminate the Nazis; (2) Germany's foreign trade plan; (3) Germany's temporary administrative organization. The authorities in the four occupied areas all acted in accordance with their own concepts and interests in the above aspects.

### Czech-Austrian Negotiations Begin Yesterday Held Separately in the Capitals of the Two Countries

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 9th] Well-informed sources here said that the Czech Republic and Austria will simultaneously hold negotiations in Prague and Vienna from the 10th. The negotiations between the two sides in Prague aim to conclude a commercial treaty, while the negotiations in Vienna are to discuss the Czech Republic's territorial claims against Austria. The Czech side requested to obtain a small part of Austrian territory along the Danube River, opposite Bratislava, so that in the future, after a canal is opened between the Oder and Danube Rivers, port facilities can be built there. The Czech Republic is willing to provide Austria with economic benefits to compensate for its territorial losses.

### Soviet Newspaper Criticizes British and American Policies Towards Germany and Austria

[United Press, Moscow, 9th] On the eve of the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet diplomatic authority weekly "New Times" published a large number of articles severely criticizing British and American policies towards Germany and Austria, and accusing the three main representatives of the US delegation, namely Clark, the US military commander in Austria; Dulles, the Republican leader; and Trebor, an expert on German economic issues. It is claimed that the US and the Soviet Union intend to establish a federal political system in Germany, which is actually a "vague way" and a means for Western capitalist monopolies to control the resources of western Germany. At the same time, a "Great Wall of China" is erected between the eastern and western occupied areas of Germany. The current issue is whether Germany will be transformed into a peaceful country or become a vassal of imperialism. The article in the weekly criticized Dulles' proposals regarding Germany and called Churchill "the old fox of British imperialism." The UK and the US are merging the occupied areas in the UK and the US economically, and their ambition is to save Germany's reactionary labor force at all costs and protect its economic forces from being liquidated. Dulles, Marshall's economic advisor, is one of the initiators of this plan. In short, narrow and monopolistic groups are directing how to reorganize Germany. These profit-seeking groups are very harmful and must be resolutely driven out by all democratic and progressive forces. Another paper criticized British and American policies towards German assets in Austria, and mentioned Clark's attitude, believing that the British and American actions violated the agreement, especially British and American support for Austria to nationalize certain enterprises. The Soviet Union believes that these enterprises are German assets and must be confiscated to compensate for losses. The articles in the "New Times" magazine mainly review foreign policy. Embassies of various countries here are paying close attention to them, because traces of the Soviet Union's future policies may be found in them.

### United States to Make Major Decision on Policy Towards Greece

[United Press, Washington, 9th] When President Truman explains his plan to intervene in the Greek situation to the Republican congressional delegation today, everyone will probably ask him to explain everything and will also urge him not to forget the situation in China. It is expected that Truman will tell the fourteen congressional leaders that the United States must take over the important task left by Britain in order to trap the Greek communists in difficulties, for this most important diplomatic decision in American history, but Truman will also assure the congressmen that US troops will not be used. This explosive issue will cause debate in a few days, and its nature may be enough to change the entire foreign policy of the United States.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] President Truman invited congressional leaders to the White House tomorrow to discuss the assistance measures the United States intends to take after the United Kingdom reduces its troops stationed in Greece. He is preparing with the White House staff today. According to the comments made by congressmen in advance, it has been clearly stated that the president should be asked to provide detailed explanations on the following two matters: (1) The relationship between the United States' assistance to Greece and the Soviet Union; (2) The possible expansion of the active assistance provided by the United States to Turkey and other places in the Mediterranean.

### Bevin and Molotov Congratulate Each Other on Their Birthdays

[Reuters, Moscow, 9th] Foreign Minister Bevin, 66, and Foreign Minister Molotov, 57, congratulated each other on their birthdays today, because today is the birthday of both of them. It is generally believed that the double happiness is a good omen for the Moscow Conference.

### United States Plans to Loan Money to South Korea to Build Transportation

[United Press, Washington, 9th] Well-informed official sources announced today that while the United States is preparing emergency assistance to Greece, it has also prepared a loan plan for Korea to build railways and other transportation facilities in the US-occupied area of southern Korea, and to repair textile and other factories. This plan can be submitted to Congress for discussion as soon as the Greek issue is resolved. It is unknown how much the loan will be. At present, the occupation fee is about 100 million US dollars per year.

### British Government's Economic Plan Sparks Fierce Debate in House of Commons Conservatives Prepare to Impeach Government

[Report from our agency] London, 10th, broadcast: Attlee's Labor government is currently facing an unprecedented crisis, and a major cabinet reshuffle is possible. The House of Commons is discussing the government's recent economic plan, scheduled for three days. The Conservatives, led by Churchill, expressed distrust, and it is expected that the number of anti-government votes jointly cast by the Conservatives and Liberals may reach more than 200.

[United Press, London, 10th] According to the latest news from London, the crisis of the Labor government can be said to be safe, because even if the opposition votes can reach 200, the Labor Party still occupies 394 of the 640 seats in the House of Commons. Prime Minister Attlee has asked all members not to give up voting under any circumstances.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Minister of Commerce Cripps will present the economic plan to the House of Commons today and call for the cooperation of the people of the country. The government will move to ask the parliament to approve this plan, while Conservative leader Churchill and others are preparing to propose an amendment, expressing regret for the government's failure to disclose the facts earlier, and believing that the government's future plan is inappropriate and even harmful, and cannot express trust in the government that has repeatedly aggravated the country's difficulties. If the amendment is passed, it will be equivalent to impeaching the government. Liberal MP Davis and seven others will also propose an amendment, condemning the government's failure to foresee the current difficulties and take appropriate measures in a timely manner. The debate is expected to last for three days. Prime Minister Attlee, Minister of Finance Dalton, Minister of Defense Alexander, and Minister of Labor Isaac of the government will all speak, and Churchill is scheduled to propose the Conservative amendment on Wednesday.

[United Press, London, 9th] The House of Commons will discuss economic issues from tomorrow. In order to cope with the situation, Prime Minister Attlee convened a secret meeting of more than 100 "rebellious" Labor MPs today to implement a scorched-earth policy.

### United States Orders Occupation Forces in Various Places to Collect Military Payment Certificates and Exchange for New Banknotes Expected to Collect 60 Million US Dollars in Tokyo

[United Press, Frankfurt, 10th] US occupation forces in Germany arrested nine suspects, including three US Army officers and civilian employees of the Army Department, half an hour after issuing an order to crack down on all counterfeit military banknotes in Western Europe. According to military officials, this order will be implemented simultaneously around the world. The order was issued by McNair, commander of the US forces in Europe, ordering all his subordinates to exchange military banknotes for another type of new banknote within a nine-hour limit on Sunday. According to McNair, this action was jointly carried out by the US Army, State Department, and Treasury Department.

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] MacArthur Headquarters ordered the recall of US military payment certificates at 10:50 this morning and blocked all external communications in Japan in advance to prevent the leakage of information. The Finance Department of MacArthur Headquarters expects to collect 60 million US dollars in military payment certificates by 6:00 PM tonight. Thereafter, the current military payment certificates will be considered illegal, and new military payment certificates will be issued to replace them. According to Colonel Ross, Director of the Finance Department, although there are no cases of counterfeiting US military payment certificates in Japan, Japanese and other nationals are suspected of hoarding large quantities of military payment certificates. Although the military has announced that these military payment certificates are only for the use of occupation personnel, it is said that Japanese people are still engaged in purchasing them.

### Hiroshima in Reconstruction: 100,000 Residents Died from Atomic Bomb

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch] Hiroshima, the first city to be bombed by an atomic bomb, is gradually being reconstructed. Humble houses, resembling "matchboxes," are being built one by one, vegetation is reviving, and an increasing number of residents are returning. After sixteen months of cultivation, Hiroshima, which was previously expected to remain desolate for many years, is now "full of life." American authorities told a delegation of Chinese journalists visiting Hiroshima that the city's current population is approximately 200,000 and is expected to reach 300,000 by the end of the war. The number of deaths caused by the atomic bomb is estimated at around 100,000. Despite the ongoing reconstruction efforts, the residents of Hiroshima and the general Japanese population will not forget the power of the atomic bomb for many years to come.

Explosion Zone to Forever Remain a Memorial

The authorities are currently drafting a plan to designate the most severely damaged area, where it is said the atomic bomb exploded in the air, as a memorial to warn the Japanese people. The empty shell of the former Commercial Museum's garden building still stands in the center of the area, within 2,000 meters of the completely devastated site. The journalist delegation saw an ancient tree, a thousand years old, uprooted by the force of the atomic bomb and burned for three days. They also witnessed an iron bridge near the museum, its two sides tilted due to the pressure of the explosion, with lanterns still hanging on the railings.

Trees Rose Skyward a Week After the Bombing

Even more astonishing is that in Hiroshima in 1945, trees suddenly rose from the ground, which was generally believed to be barren, at an extraordinary speed towards the sky for several days, before gradually slowing down and returning to normal. When the Chinese journalist delegation visited Dr. Takeuchi, the Japanese director of the Red Cross Hospital, he said that he only saw a flash of light like flames when the atomic bomb exploded, and heard nothing. He immediately lost consciousness, and when he regained consciousness (he was indoors), he found himself lying in the courtyard, with six small bones broken.

Mortality Rate of Residents Affected

His hospital treated 50,000 residents injured by the atomic bomb. After conducting thorough research, the following conclusions were reached: (1) All those within 0.88 kilometers of the blast center who were outside were killed. (2) Of those within 1.1 kilometers, 90.6% died. (3) Of those within 2.3 kilometers, 1.6% died. (4) Of those living in wooden houses within 0.5 kilometers, 99.9% died. (5) Of those within 1 kilometer, 75.3% died. The mortality rate for those living in reinforced concrete buildings was much lower than for those living in wooden houses. (6) Of those living in reinforced concrete buildings within 0.2 kilometers of the blast center, 97% died. (7) Of those within 0.5 kilometers, 30% died. (8) Of those within 1 kilometer, only 6% died. The experience described by a Catholic priest was similar to that of Takeuchi, but he stated that the atomic bomb was not the reason for Japan's collapse. The Japanese people only regarded such terrifying weapons as part of the war.

Remnants of the Hiroshima City Hall: It is said that the atomic bomb was originally aimed at this location, but it was spared from complete destruction because the bomb landed slightly north of it. (Special dispatch from the New York Times)

### Punjab, India Still in Chaos; Fires Rage, Situation Tense

[Reuters, Lahore, 9th] Riots in Lahore and Rawalpindi in the Punjab province have not yet subsided. The government has ordered the military to shoot those who disobey orders. Unrest has also broken out in other parts of Punjab province. Murree, a European summer resort north of Lahore and Rawalpindi, is still burning today. Officials said that Murree has been invaded by people from the Northwest Frontier Province. Officials also said that the cities of Jhelum, Gujrat, Toba Tek Singh, and the Taxila University, 160 miles northwest of Lahore, are all on fire. Punjab Governor Sir Evan Jenkins has personally gone to Lahore and Rawalpindi to take charge.

At the same time, the "Action Committee Against Partition" today issued an order for Hindus and Sikhs in Punjab to hold a general strike for one day on Tuesday to protest the partition of India. However, the order explicitly stated that there should be no processions or gatherings on that day. Lahore is currently relatively stable, but military vigilance remains high. At the same time, because sanitation workers have not cleaned the streets for four days, flies are swarming throughout the city, creating unsanitary conditions. Authorities today also issued an order prohibiting drumming, bugle playing, or the use of loudspeakers during curfew hours for eight days, with the exception of places of worship.

### Russell on the Atomic Bomb

[United Press, London, 9th] Renowned mathematical philosopher Bertrand Russell said that the United States' monopoly on the atomic bomb cannot last for more than five years. According to him, if the new science is to prevent the world from being destroyed, the atomic bomb must be handed over to a world government. Therefore, we must fully support this novel political and military organization, otherwise, we can expect to encounter a worldwide catastrophe of terror and destruction beyond our imagination. He also said that within five years, all industrialized countries with sufficient resources of uranium and thorium will be able to manufacture atomic bombs. In his opinion, there are two ways for a world government to emerge: the better way is for countries to reach an agreement, while the quickest way is for one country to dominate the world. If such a dominant country were to emerge, it would clearly be either the United States or the Soviet Union.

### Britain and the United States Demand Investigation into Hungarian Internal Affairs; Soviet Union Has Refused; Many Arrested in Hungarian Anti-Government Conspiracy Case

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] Regarding the Soviet Union's interference in Hungary's internal affairs, Britain and the United States have already sent a note to the Soviet chairman of the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, accusing the Soviet Union of attempting to replace the current Hungarian government with a dictatorship of a minority party, and proposing that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union jointly investigate the situation in Hungary. It has been learned that the Soviet authorities have refused, saying that the demands of Britain and the United States are "unjustified interference."

[Reuters, Budapest, 9th] Since the discovery in Hungary of a so-called conspiracy to overthrow the Republican government and establish a government similar to that formerly led by Regent Horthy, many military and political officials and business magnates have been arrested. Former Hungarian Foreign Ministry official Szent-Iványi and twelve other Hungarians accused of participating in conspiracy activities have been tried by the People's Court. Szent-Iványi testified in court that the reactionaries attempted to expand their position in the army and government through Kovács, the secretary of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, who was recently arrested by the Soviet army. They had no fixed ideas about the future form of government and intended to use political parties to achieve their goals first.

### Jin Shenfu Road near Lupu Bridge: Major Fire in Industrial Area During the Day; Dozens of Factories and Homes Destroyed, Losses Huge and Incalculable

[Reported by our newspaper] At around 2:00 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in a cotton yarn warehouse on the third floor of the Lide Cloth Factory, located at No. 77, B block, Lane 410, Jin Shenfu Road near Lupu Bridge. The fire quickly spread to a large amount of cotton yarn, and in an instant, it affected the adjacent Lixing Dyeing Factory at No. 78, B block, the Mingfeng Mercerizing Factory at No. 77, A block, the warehouse of the No. 77 Family Industry Cooperative, the office and materials room of the No. 78, A block, the No. 79 China Industrial Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the No. 80 Huimin Medical Cotton Gauze Factory, and the new factory of the No. 82 China Industrial Factory. Fire departments from the Central and Taishan districts dispatched multiple pump trucks to the scene to extinguish the fire. The Lujiawan Police Station, led by Chief Zhao, along with the first and second section chiefs Wang Liyan and Hao Jingxu, inspector Qin Bolang, sergeants Hao Chen and Ma Shaosong, and plainclothes police officer Li Zihua, together with volunteer police squad leader Wang Hansheng and Fan Yonglian, led their teams to the fire scene to maintain order and assist the affected factories and residents in salvaging goods. By around 3:00 PM, the fire had reached its peak and had spread to six civilian houses: No. 69, A block, Wang Ziqing, Nos. 70-71, Li Yaochang, No. 72, Chen Jinshan, No. 73, Huisheng Dormitory, and No. 74, Changxing Dormitory. The Datongnan Cigarette Factory at No. 17, Lane 474, Xujiahui Road suffered significant water damage due to the large amount of cigarettes stored in the factory. The fire was finally brought under control at around 5:00 PM, but there were still embers, so two water-spraying trucks remained until around 10:00 PM. According to an investigation by our reporter, the Lixing, Lide, and China factories were almost completely destroyed. Police officers at the scene told our reporter that there were two reasons for the fire: (1) The lane was too long, and the distance from the fire hydrant on the main road was too far, which delayed the water supply for firefighting. (2) The factories had a large amount of diesel fuel stored, and although police officers tried their best to move a lot of it out, some of the diesel fuel was ignited, making the fire uncontrollable. Firefighters at the time found that the water volume in the hydrant was insufficient for suction, so they connected to the water in the nearby Rihui Port River for replenishment. It was also said that the head of the bao (neighborhood), Yao Zhaowu, sacrificed his own property by rushing to help others move items, which is worthy of praise. As for the losses in this fire, in addition to the destruction of dozens of houses, the other goods were temporarily impossible to estimate. In short, the figure will be extremely large.

Also, during the fire, a sock factory apprentice named Ni Yutang fell from the roof while trying to escape and was injured, coughing up blood. He was immediately rushed to the hospital for treatment by fire rescue personnel.

(The first photo shows the situation during the fire. Taken by our newspaper. The second photo shows the apprentice who fell and is being rescued. Taken by China News Agency.)

### Differing Legal Perspectives of Prosecutors on "Gold Rush" Cases; Preliminary Informal Discussions to Be Held

After investigation and investigation by the handling prosecutors, the details of each case have been largely clarified. However, the prosecutors have different legal views on such cases. For example, whether it is illegal to buy gold and US dollars before the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, and the standards for crimes such as "manipulation" and "hoarding" are not clearly defined in the law. Therefore, all the "gold rush" cases are currently temporarily suspended. The prosecutors will have informal discussions in order to obtain a unified interpretation. If a decision cannot still be made, an interpretation will be requested from the Ministry of Judicial Administration.

### Who Will Be the Future "King of Manure"? The Lowest Bid Price is 450 Million

[Reported by our newspaper] The removal of feces has already been approved by the Council and is contracted out to businesses. The Health Bureau is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the contracting methods and details. It is reported that the lowest bidding price of the Health Bureau is 450 million per month, with 9,000 cartloads of manure per day as the principle. The contractor's wages, transportation fees, and other expenses also require 450 million yuan per month, so the contractor's total monthly expenses are 900 million yuan. If the contractor can obtain more than 9,000 incidents, the income will be calculated on a 70/30 split, with the contractor getting 70% and the Health Bureau getting 30%. If less than 9,000 cartloads of manure are obtained per day, the contractor will lose money.

### Yu Hualong Remanded for Retrial; Yuan Ludeng and Others Called as Witnesses

[Reported by our newspaper] Yu Hualong, who was accused of serving as the deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Puppet Baojia Autonomous Region, was previously sentenced to one year and six months by the High Court. The defendant appealed against the sentence, and the High Court remanded the case for retrial. The hair of Yu Hualong was already white, he was tall, wore dark glasses, and wore a black Ma-style wool overcoat. He stated that due to the bombing on Xizang Road on February 14, the northern section of the road was blockaded by the Japanese. The enemy wanted us to come out and handle the baojia in order to lift the blockade. Gao Yigen, a special agent of the Puppet Police Bureau's Special High Branch, forced us to organize the Urban Liaison Association, which was later renamed the Baojia Autonomous Committee, appointing Yuan Ludeng as the director, Zhou Bangjun and he as deputy directors, and Xie Baosheng and others as members. A meeting was held once at the Carlton Theatre on February 25, and another meeting was held at the Jinmen Hotel on March 1. No actual work was done. Witnesses Yuan Ludeng, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, Zhou Bangjun, who had been sentenced to three years, and Xie Baosheng, who had been sentenced to two years and six months, were then called to testify. The court hearing lasted a long time. It was decided to reschedule the trial, and the defendant and the three witnesses were all remanded in custody.

### Machine-Made Coal Briquette Association Petitions for Equal Contracting for Coal Briquette Distribution

[Reported by our newspaper] The Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau previously selected the Yitaixing No. 1 Factory, the Nanyang No. 1 Factory, the China Factory, and the Xinfu Factory, based on the production volume and equipment of various factories in the city, to contract for the distribution of coal briquettes to public education personnel. Yesterday, representatives of the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to request the revocation of this order and to change it to having all members of the Coal Briquette Industry Association contract for the distribution equally. Director Wu stated that this could not be done. He also said that the reason why these four coal briquette factories were selected for contracting was because the Fuel Management Committee had to guarantee that their composition met the standards, that is, they were made of 50% white coal dust, 40% coal slag, and 10% yellow mud. The Fuel Management Committee also sent people to supervise the manufacturing. If there are many contractors, more people must be sent to supervise, which is practically impossible.

### China Merchants Shipyard and Workers Reach Termination Settlement

[Reported by our newspaper] The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has convened both parties for negotiations regarding the China Merchants Bureau's Third Shipyard's dismissal of 124 temporary workers. An agreement has been reached and a written record signed yesterday afternoon, stipulating: (1) In accordance with the methods for dismissing workers with indefinite contracts by the Municipal Labour-Management Arbitration Committee, dismissal pay will be issued in accordance with the law, and a certificate of leaving the factory will be issued separately. (2) The above-mentioned temporary workers should deduct three months' worth of temporary wages from the date of their employment in the factory, and the factory should reissue all of their weekly wages and holiday wages for the remaining service days according to the wages at the time of dismissal. The above method is only a one-time dismissal and cannot be used as an example for other people. (3) The wages of the above workers have been agreed by the factory to be settled up to March 20. (4) If the factory adds workers in the future, the above workers have the right to be re-employed preferentially based on merit.

### Labor Dispute Between Weitai and Xiechang Factories Awaits Mediation

[Our Newspaper Report] The Weitai Button Factory at 203 Jiangyin Street, Xiaoximen, Nanshi, has over 200 workers. Their salaries were originally paid every half-month, but now they are three periods overdue. Starting at 8 PM the night before last, workers surrounded the factory director and manager demanding full payment. The factory then stopped providing meals, and the situation remained deadlocked until 6 AM yesterday morning, causing work to come to a standstill. Yesterday afternoon, the workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding: (1) full payment of the one and a half months of salary owed by the employer; (2) continued payment of wages in the future; (3) payment of the February cost-of-living allowance; and (4) no dismissal of workers without cause. The employer claims that the business is unable to sustain itself, and this action is out of necessity. The Social Affairs Bureau has urged the factory to resume providing meals, and the workers are working as usual, awaiting mediation.

The Xiechang Cigarette Factory on Bailinan Road has over 300 workers. They recently filed a complaint with the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the factory had not paid the year-end bonus from last year, and wages were not paid on time. The factory also uses many child laborers in place of adults, and the workers' attempts to organize a labor union were suppressed. The bureau is currently sending staff to mediate.

### One-Third Cost-of-Living Allowance for Child Laborers Considered Reasonable, Wu Kaixian Expresses Opinion

[Our Newspaper Report] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee previously decided that after freezing the cost-of-living index, one-third of the February cost-of-living allowance would be paid to child laborers (including apprentices, trainees, and those in training). During a recent meeting of the Municipal Council, representatives from the cotton spinning industry petitioned that child laborers should be treated equally. The Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, expressed his opinion yesterday, stating: Child laborers are generally only assistants and are not the primary financial supporters of their families. Therefore, while it is inappropriate not to pay the allowance at all, paying one-third is more reasonable (as the cost-of-living allowance for daily necessities is calculated for a family of three). Although some child laborers are responsible for supporting their families due to the death of a parent, this is a minority.

Furthermore, workers in the cigarette and ribbon industries have filed complaints with the Social Affairs Bureau because some employers are not paying the cost-of-living allowance in accordance with the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee's decision. The bureau will strictly order the employers to comply.

### Shanghai Traffic is Worse Than Ever Seen, No Money Makes It Difficult to Start, Expert Offers a Bitter Smile, Building Tunnels Considered Absolutely Impossible

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, a reporter visited Dr. Kang Hui (see photo), an American public utilities expert recently hired to help improve traffic in the city, and asked for his opinion on the current state of traffic in Shanghai. He smiled bitterly and said, "Very bad," adding that he had never seen any city with so many rickshaws and pedicabs crowding the streets as Shanghai. The reporter asked whether the excessive number of rickshaws was the biggest cause of traffic disorder in the city, and whether they should be banned. He replied that he could not answer that question yet. The reporter also asked whether he had already devised concrete measures to improve traffic in the city. Dr. Kang Hui said that he had not brought any plans from the United States, as purely theoretical and abstract plans cannot be adapted to Shanghai's reality. His task is to examine the current state of Shanghai's traffic, conduct a comprehensive study, identify the root causes of the problems, and then prescribe the right medicine, proposing concrete measures to the municipal government for reference in improving traffic. He said that he inspected various districts within four or five hours of arriving in China, and yesterday morning he also visited the city's tram company, holding a review meeting with senior officials. Their initial work will continue to involve inspecting various public utility institutions, serving as basic data for research and discussion.

Streetcars Will Be Eliminated

Dr. Kang Hui told the reporter that the three major transportation tools in the United States are streetcars, trackless trolleys, and buses. In recent years, streetcars have been gradually phased out. He said that Shanghai may also adopt this trend, as streetcars have become outdated, which is a fact. He also knows that the current Mayor of Shanghai is not satisfied with streetcars, so this issue is worthy of study.

When asked whether building "tunnels" would be a good solution to Shanghai's traffic problems, Dr. Kang Hui's answer was straightforward: "Absolutely impossible." Building one mile of tunnel would cost 5 to 6 million U.S. dollars, and the Shanghai municipal government has no money. Where would the tunnels be built? He believes that although tunnels can solve some traffic problems because underground trains are incredibly fast, the cost is too high, and it is too early to talk about it.

Streets Too Narrow, Demolishing Houses Difficult

Dr. Kang Hui believes that many of the city's streets are indeed too narrow, which greatly affects traffic. However, he understands that this problem cannot be solved in the short term, because if houses are demolished and rebuilt, it would disrupt the residents' peace, and the municipal government does not have such vast funds. If the money were taken from the citizens, thereby increasing the burden on the citizens, it would not be feasible at present.

Finally, Dr. Kang Hui said that, in short, after fully understanding the traffic situation in Shanghai, he would make concrete recommendations to the municipal government to ensure that Shanghai's traffic moves towards a more rational and civilized state in the future. He said, "Make the vehicles on the road run faster, so that people can go home earlier!"

The lawyers representing the appellants, Di Bais and others, also filed a cross-appeal in court, requesting that the one-thousand-fold increase ruled by the First Instance be increased to three thousand times based on foreign exchange adjustments. The High Court concluded its hearing and issued its verdict yesterday morning, the main text of which read: "The appeal and cross-appeal are both dismissed, and the litigation costs of the Second Instance shall be borne by both parties."

### Female Companion Noticed Hiding, Escaped After Robbery and Arrested

[Our Newspaper Report] At 7:45 PM last night, three thieves broke into the home of Song Lansheng, who runs a coal business at 101 Yongcheng Lane, Dongdaming Road, Hudong. One of them was carrying a handgun. They stole a gold wire bracelet, a diamond ring, a wedding ring, and a flower ring before fleeing with the stolen goods. At that time, one of Song's daughters followed them and reported to the traffic police, who relayed the information to the Tilanqiao Precinct. Section Chief Ma immediately led officers Yu Yingkai and Chen Yaguan in a police car to Yuging Lane on Changzhi Road. Based on the daughter's instructions, they arrested one of the bandits at the end of the lane. The suspect identified himself as Feng Dingliang, 31 years old. He confessed that his two accomplices were Ye Jiakuan and Chen Aqing, both from Ningbo. Aqing had the gun. They resided in room 11 of the Xinhua Hotel at 3, Lane 12, Fujian Road. The investigating officers went to the aforementioned location and apprehended Ye Jiakuan. Chen Aqing is still at large.

### Factory Director and Others at World Book Company Printing Plant Suspected of Collaborating with the Enemy, Parties Accuse Each Other During Interrogation

[Our Newspaper Report] Xue Juemin, the factory director of the Dalianwan Road printing plant of the World Book Company, his deputy Shen Lianfang, and employee Zhou Xiangyun, were accused of collaborating with the enemy by Wang Furou (also known as Wang Fuchou), the chief of the plant's engineering section. Xue and others counter-accused Wang Furou of stealing books and making false accusations out of spite. Yesterday, all four defendants, Xue, Shen, Zhou, and Wang, were interrogated in the High Court. According to the prosecutor's indictment, Xue Juemin was the accountant for the World Book Company's investment group stationed at the plant. During the war of resistance, the Dalianwan Road printing plant of the World Book Company was occupied by the enemy and renamed the Huazhong Printing Bureau. On August 1, 1943, Xue and Zhou Xiangyun, a plant employee fluent in Japanese, negotiated with the Japanese embassy to recover the printing plant. After taking over, Xue became the de facto factory director, and Shen Zhangfang, the plant's manager, became the deputy factory director. Zhou also held an important position, liaising with the enemy. Together, they handled the plant's business, printing false national textbooks and enemy army military tutorials for the puppet China United Publishing Company, as well as organizational charts of the Chongqing party, government, and military. Wang Furou was the chief of the plant's engineering section and also helped in a department. During yesterday's court hearing, the defendants accused each other. The hearing was adjourned, and all four defendants were released on their original bail.

### War Criminal Kurosawa Trial Concluded, Countless Crimes Committed in Hangzhou, Overwhelming Evidence but Still Trying to Deny

[Our Newspaper Report] Kurosawa Tsuguo, a Japanese war criminal, was formerly a special commissioner of the Japanese pacification unit in Hangzhou. During the occupation period, he arbitrarily killed people, committing heinous crimes. Yesterday, the First Pacification District Military Tribunal held a hearing, scheduled to pronounce the verdict at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month.

Kurosawa Tsuguo is a graduate of Waseda University in Tokyo. On August 23, 1937, he enlisted in the army. The following year, he came to China with the army, was assigned to the Tsuchihashi unit of the 22nd Japanese Division, stationed in Hangzhou. After completing his term of service in August and September 1940, he was "entrusted" by the Tsuchihashi unit's staff department to carry out intelligence work. At the same time, he organized a pacification work team, which was known to the people in the occupied areas as the Kurosawa unit. The unit was led by the defendant and consisted of a general team and three detachments, with a large number of personnel, possessing over 400 rifles, over 100 short guns, and over a dozen machine guns. They were often stationed in the areas of Jianqiao, Genshanmen, Qibao, Pengjiabu, Xiashi, and Xucun in Hangzhou, and their activities extended as far as Jinhua and Lanxi. From its establishment on November 3, 1940, the unit began killing five people in the second month. Thereafter, it killed people once or twice a month, totaling over 120 people. The families of the deceased who can be traced are Yang Xiaomao, Yu Tangchun, Yu Quan'gen, and "Hemp Skin Tiger". The Kurosawa unit also murdered fifty to sixty people on the vegetable field cultivated by Yang Tongsheng at the Shengdi Temple in Beiyutan. Some were killed with knives. Zhou Shaojun, a civilian forced to bury the bodies at the time, can testify to this. In 1941, the unit continuously killed twenty-seven people, who were all buried in Beiyutan. Among those killed, including Lu Ziqing, there was a woman who was killed by the defendant himself with a machine gun. One person who was shot but not killed was buried alive by the defendant. This was personally testified to by Zhang A'gen, who was forced to bury the bodies at the time. Su Ronghe, the former acting county magistrate of Hangzhou, was also arrested and taken to Genshanmen for execution but was fortunately released. He witnessed many Chinese soldiers being tied up at the scene, and the defendant's unit had shovels and other burial equipment. As for the military and government personnel killed who can be investigated, there are over forty people, including Tang Maolin, the captain of the anti-Japanese self-defense unit, and Shen Peizeng, an intelligence officer of the 10th Army Group. The Kurosawa unit, stationed in the Hangzhou County area, had lax discipline. Killing, arson, rape, and looting were countless.

After the victory, the criminal hid in the Hangzhou Japanese Overseas Chinese Management Office. He was arrested and interrogated by the Zhejiang Higher Court Prosecutor's Office, which sent prosecutors to inspect the execution site outside Genshanmen. Sixty-one relatively complete skeletons were excavated. After forensic examination, it was determined that eighteen had died from knife wounds, thirteen from blunt force trauma, seventeen from gunshot wounds, and eight had been buried alive. The criminal was subsequently transferred by the Zhejiang Higher Prosecutor's Office together with the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters to the military tribunal for formal prosecution as a war criminal.

Yesterday, based on Kurosawa's confession at the Zhejiang Higher Prosecutor's Office (in which he admitted to killing over thirty people under orders from the staff department), the court conducted a stern interrogation and presented photographs of the excavated skeletons, maps of the execution site, and old forensic identification reports. However, the criminal overturned his previous confession and denied everything. After arguments by the prosecutor and defense lawyer, the court adjourned the hearing to the 17th for the verdict. Kurosawa was wearing a black suit with tortoiseshell glasses, looking refined and gentle. At first glance, one would hardly have thought that he was a murderous demon.

### Fifty-Eight Associations, Including Rubber and Hardware, Petition the Direct Tax Bureau, Director Lou States Extension of Reporting Deadline Will Be Submitted and Approved Based on Facts

[Our Newspaper Report] Fifty-eight units of industrial and commercial associations in this city, including rubber, hardware, and department stores, reported that the Direct Tax Bureau had set a deadline of March 15 of this year for reporting business income tax for the 36th year. The various industry associations, citing the short deadline and their inability to complete the reporting on time, petitioned the Direct Tax Bureau yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Representatives Zhao Xianji, Hong Nianzu, Ba Lingyun, Wang Jingdong, and Cai Hezhang, among others, requested the simplification of tax collection procedures and an extension of the reporting deadline. Director Lou received them and explained that the deadline was ordered by the Supreme National Defense Council, and the bureau had no authority to change it. Lou also explained: The Supreme National Defense Council has explicitly instructed that those who, for special reasons, are unable to complete the settlement on time may, with the approval of the competent tax collection authority, estimate the amount of income tax payable and first pay 50% of it. The extended deadline for the settlement report shall not exceed April 15. To show consideration for the difficulties of businesses, Lou stated that he could submit the request for review and approval based on the facts. However, he still hoped that all businesses would comply with the regulations and report before the deadline of March 15. The representatives left around 1:00 PM.

### Retrial of Collision Case, Relatives of Deceased Cai Zhiling Will Sue for Damages

[Our Newspaper Report] The District Court reopened the case of the collision between the Zhijiang and Huatonger ships yesterday, summoning witnesses Jiang Lexing (second mate of the Zhijiang), Yu Guiqing (person in charge of the No. 305 iron barge towed by the Huatong), Bao Maoju (engineer of the Huatong), and the relatives of the victims, Cai Chengguan. The defendants, Xin Chengfang and Zhang Jinsheng, also appeared in court. In addition, Li Qianwang, the manager of the Tongji Shipping Company, to which the Zhijiang ship belonged, was also summoned for questioning because of his civil liability. According to Jiang Lexing, two minutes before the accident, he saw the Huatong ship half a nautical mile away. The Zhijiang ship sounded two whistles because a sailboat was blocking the way, causing the collision with the iron barge towed by the Huatong ship. The court asked about the number of passengers on the Zhijiang ship, and Wang replied that there were about 700 people, although the regulations only allowed for about 300. One person was injured at the scene of the accident. During the rescue, Captain Xin Chengfang and all the crew members did not leave their posts. He also stated that after the accident, he went to the bottom cabin and searched. Seeing that no one was there, he left the cabin. Yu Guiqing stated that the No. 305 iron barge he was in charge of was tied to the left side of the Huatong ship. The iron barge had a red light on it. The No. 45 iron barge was on the right side and also had a green light. Two to three minutes after hearing the Huatong ship sound its whistle, the collision occurred, and the No. 305 was also damaged. Bao Maoju stated that he was responsible for driving the Huatong ship's engine. After hearing the whistle, he slowed down and then stopped, immediately reversing to give way, but the Zhijiang ship still crashed into them. Cai Chengguan stated that his uncle, Cai Zhiling, was seriously injured on the spot during the accident and was sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment at 6:00 AM the next morning, but he died at 9:00 AM. The victim had 2.5 million yuan in cash and a lot of luggage. He will file a civil lawsuit demanding compensation. Li Qianyu stated that after the accident, the Jianghai Customs sent divers into the sunken ship to retrieve some of the luggage, but no bodies were found, so he was unwilling to bear the responsibility for compensation. After a brief interrogation, the defendants Xin Chengfang and Zhang Jinsheng were released on their original bail. The retrial was adjourned to another date.

### Public Utility Prices to Be Adjusted and Announced Soon

The Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided to increase the allocation price of coal from 145,000 yuan per catty to 210,000 yuan. The Public Utilities Bureau feels that after the price of coal increases, public utilities such as electric lights, gas, trams, and ferries will inevitably increase in price; otherwise, they will not be able to sustain themselves. Seeing this, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau specifically requested instructions from the mayor yesterday. It is reported that the mayor has already approved the adjustment, and the multiple of the adjustment will be announced soon.

### Fooled by a House-Topping Scam, How Can Ninety Taels of Gold Be Thrown Away?

[Our Newspaper Report] Mao Zizhang, who lives at No. 39 Zhao Villa, Changning Road, found his residence too cramped.

### Passenger Aircraft Resumption Not Yet Ordered, Candidate for General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation Finalized, Shanghai-Philippines Air Route to Resume Soon

As of yesterday, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) had not yet received an order from the Ministry of Communications regarding the resumption of domestic passenger flights. The Ministry of Communications has also not yet made a decision on the adjustment of ticket prices. As for the selection of a successor for the General Manager of CNAC, it is rumored that the Ministry of Communications has indeed finalized the selection and will appoint Liu Jingyi. However, Mr. Liu has not yet returned to China, and all business is still being managed by General Manager Shen Dexie. Also, due to the small area of the Grace Park Airport in Manila leased for the Shanghai-Philippines route, although international passenger routes have resumed, passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and the Philippines has not been smooth. Now, CNAC, through various efforts, has successfully negotiated the lease of the large Makati Airport in Manila for aircraft operations. Therefore, passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and the Philippines will officially resume in the near future.

[San Bao News] The Civil Aeronautics Administration will establish an office in this city to strengthen the management of civil aviation organizations. Senior official Lin has been sent to Shanghai to oversee the preparations.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Questions

Partnership Split

Jiang Zisheng asked: A, B, and C jointly opened a business twenty years ago with a capital of 120,000 yuan, 40,000 yuan per person. The shop went bankrupt in the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1936], and after offsetting all the capital, it still owed debts. A and B paid 10,000 yuan. Now, the shop is sold in the current year for 2 million yuan. How should this amount be distributed? (1) Should it be divided proportionally based on the initial investment and the additional payments? (2) Can the additional payments from the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1936] be returned first, adjusted for inflation, and the remainder be divided according to the initial investment? However, if the inflation-adjusted value of the additional payments exceeds the value of the shop, how should the remaining amount be handled legally?

Also, A, B, C, and D organized a charitable association (for activities such as providing coffins and distributing grain) twenty years ago. A contributed the most, 25,000 yuan, B contributed 20,000 yuan, C contributed 3,000 yuan, and D contributed 2,000 yuan, totaling 50,000 yuan. A invested the funds in a company, and A held the stock certificate. The company went bankrupt in the current year. A's son (because A is deceased) intends to invest the funds in another company. (1) Can he proceed without consulting B, C, and D? If one of B, C, or D objects, will it be effective? (2) Should he first consult with B, C, and D before proceeding? (3) If B, C, and D do not agree to invest in another company, can A's son withdraw A's share and invest it elsewhere?

[Lawyer Mi Xitong's Answer] (1) Calculate the proportion based on the cost of living index of the initial capital and the additional payments at the time. (2) It is unreasonable to first return the additional payments. The 2 million yuan from the shop value should be distributed accordingly. Also, (1) No, it should be based on the majority. (2) Yes. (3) A's share can only be withdrawn and invested elsewhere with the consent of B, C, and D.

### National Standard Textbooks: Seven-Union Continues to Print and Supply

Production costs soar, piracy disappears

[Report from our newspaper] The printing and supply situation of the current term's national standard primary and secondary school textbooks has led to a surge in piracy in various places due to the announcement of open copyright. However, recently, as paper prices and printing labor costs have soared, the textbook prices, the Ministry of Education has adopted a price-limiting policy, freezing them along with the January cost of living index, only allowing sales at 94 times the fixed price. All sales revenue is far from enough to cover the direct cost of book production. As a result, pirates in various places have suddenly stopped their operations, and those who had purchased cheap paper are also hoarding paper and no longer printing books. In view of this, the Ministry of Education has specifically notified the Seven-Union Office, hoping that it will still be fully responsible for the supply before June of this year. It is heard that the original method of the Seven-Union Office was to allocate and transport fixed quantities according to the education statistics of various provinces and cities. However, it has been greatly affected by piracy, price fluctuations, transportation, military affairs, and other factors, making it impossible to adjust surpluses and deficiencies, or to compensate for shortages with surpluses. Therefore, some areas have a large surplus of books, while other areas still feel a shortage. Recently, in order to fulfill its final obligation to the national standard edition, the Seven-Union Office increased printing by more than ten million copies at the end of last month to help the Northeast, Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, and other book-deficient areas. With transportation in the Central Plains disrupted, special arrangements have been made with the China National Aviation Corporation for air transport. All books have now been shipped and are accompanied by teaching guides. If there is a shortage of books in various places, they can be purchased from the Shanghai branches of the office. The actual selling price is still only 94 times the fixed price.

### Chinese Students Studying in the United States: Graduates of Missionary Universities Account for 40 Percent

[United States Information Service, New York, 10th] A report from the United Board for Christian Colleges in China stated that the total losses suffered by the thirteen Christian universities in China during the war amounted to at least fifteen million US dollars. Among them, eleven universities fell into the hands of the Japanese army. The report stated that many of the buildings of the eleven universities were destroyed by artillery fire, and most of the others were missing doors and windows. The equipment in the libraries and laboratories, as well as the drainage pipes and electrical installations, were all removed. At the end of the war, only St. John's University in Shanghai and West China Union University in Chengdu remained intact. The other eleven universities were in temporary school buildings in the interior. However, the number of students enrolled in eight schools from 1945 to 1946 was 11,020, almost twice the pre-war level.

The United Board report also stated that more than 40 percent of Chinese students pursuing further education in the United States are graduates of Christian universities in China. Almost three-quarters of all effective scientific work in Chinese agriculture has been completed by Christian universities. Christian universities also pay attention to women's education, and two of them have facilities for women's liberal arts education in China.

### Shanxi Provincial Department of Education Orders the Promulgation of Measures for Integrating Military, Agricultural, and Rural Education, Applicable to Counties Implementing the New Village System on a Trial Basis

[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan] In order to effectively establish schools in every village and enroll everyone in school in the model counties implementing the military-agricultural system and the counties implementing the new village system on a trial basis in Shanxi Province, to complete the six-year village education required for national compulsory education, the Department of Education has specially formulated the "Taiyuan County Implementation Measures for Six-Year Military-Agricultural Village Education," which is promulgated for implementation. These measures are applicable to model counties implementing the military-agricultural system and counties implementing the new village system on a trial basis. The following is an exploration of the key points: (1) According to the fact that there are 14 newly compiled townships in a county, with a definite number of 10,784 school-age children, calculated at 50 students per class, a total of 216 classes should be set up. Each township should set up a central national school, except for the central national school in Chengguan Township, which has 21 classes, the rest of the townships should set up 15 classes per school (if the residential villages in each township are far apart or have a large population, national schools or national branch schools may be set up separately, subject to the supervision and guidance of the central national school). Based on the estimated differences in the number of school-age children in each year, 72 senior classes and 144 junior classes should be set up. With the class system, no matter whether it is senior or junior, each class should have 50 students as the standard. Senior classes with less than 25 students are not allowed to open classes, and classes are only allowed to be split if there are more than 75 students. Senior classes may adopt compound teaching, and junior classes may adopt single-grade teaching. Each two senior classes should have three teachers, and each junior class should have one teacher, totaling 252 teachers. In addition to the current 138 teachers, there is a shortage of 114 teachers, who will be selected and trained from the outstanding personnel laid off from the county, district, and village cadres this time. (2) Teacher salaries: The principal of the central national school is appointed at the sixth grade, with a monthly salary of 120 yuan; the director of teaching is appointed at the seventh grade, with a monthly salary of 110 yuan; senior teachers are appointed at the eighth grade, with a monthly salary of 100 yuan; junior teachers are appointed at the ninth grade, with a monthly salary of 90 yuan, totaling 108 senior teachers and 144 junior teachers. However, the salaries of the principals, directors of teaching, and senior teachers are allocated by the county as a whole. As for the salaries of junior teachers, they should be handled by the residents of each township themselves according to the current regulations, and the school board should be responsible for handling it. (3) Temporary expenses: The grain rent that each township's residential villages should receive from the old school land divided into shares should be used as the temporary expenses for the senior classes of the central school in each township (if the grain rent is too much or insufficient, or if there is none, the county may give or allocate it appropriately according to actual needs). As for the temporary expenses for junior classes, they should still be raised by the residents of each township themselves. (4) Equipment expenses: Based on the actual needs of school equipment in the residential villages of each township, the people should bear it fairly, and in accordance with the regulations on donating funds to schools, the public should be encouraged to donate generously. (5) Public miscellaneous book expenses: 14,000 yuan per month for each senior class, allocated by the county as a whole; 1,400 yuan per month for each junior class, raised by the residents of each township themselves, and may be paid in kind. (6) Senior classes in each central national school should set up vocational classes to subsidize poor children in each school with the income from on-site production. (7) In addition to using the provincial-compiled military-agricultural national language common sense, national standard textbooks will be temporarily used, and the province will edit and supplement military-agricultural teaching materials at any time.

### Self-funded Students Will Sue Song and Bei, Presenting Three Reasons

[Report from our newspaper] The second batch of self-funded students in this city sent representatives to Beijing at the end of November last year to petition for the settlement of foreign exchange at the old exchange rate, but to no avail. Then, on February 18 this year, they petitioned again. At that time, President Song of the Executive Yuan promised to reply in two weeks. However, only three days after the petition, the central government ordered the suspension of passport issuance. Later, President Song and the Governor of the Central Bank resigned one after another, resulting in the failure of the second petition. The self-funded students were greatly indignant, believing that former President Song and former Governor Bei had failed to fulfill their promises, causing great losses to more than a thousand students. Recently, it has been decided that the self-funded students will jointly submit a formal petition, and in accordance with legal procedures, request the Control Yuan to impeach Song and Bei, and at the same time file an administrative lawsuit.

According to Ling Shuang, Vice Chairman of the Self-funded Students Association, who told reporters yesterday, the association has three reasons for impeaching and suing Song and Bei: (1) The Ministry of Education held the self-funded student examination in July last year. This is an established national policy that should be implemented. However, Mr. Song went against it and did not approve the application of the admitted students for foreign exchange settlement at the old exchange rate, and now he has suspended the issuance of passports, meaning that he is not allowed to go abroad. These contradictory and improper measures constitute one of the derelictions of duty. (2) After the results of the self-funded student examination were released, the students requested to settle foreign exchange at the old exchange rate. During the first petition, President Song, Governor Bei, and various ministries shirked responsibility. Mr. Song even knew that the exchange rate would change but ignored it, causing great economic losses to the students. This is the third dereliction of duty. (3) After the first self-funded student examination, the government clearly stipulated that those who had not passed the Ministry of Education's examination would not be allowed to go abroad in the future. The students knew to abide by national laws and regulations. However, according to statistics from the Ministry of Education, between the first and second examinations, more than 1,000 people went abroad without passing the examination. At the same time, President Song's own three daughters and the Governor's three sons all went abroad privately without taking the examination. Song and Bei promulgated laws and regulations but violated them themselves, which is indeed a corruption of power.

Currently, the Self-funded Students Association is hiring lawyers and experts to prepare the lawsuit procedures and will publish a formal petition in the near future. On the one hand, they are still requesting Song and Bei to continue to ask the newly reorganized government to settle foreign exchange at the 3,350 exchange rate and to restore the issuance of passports for going abroad. If this is not allowed, they will request Song and Bei to compensate all students for the full examination fee and the full difference in expenses between the 3,350 and 12,000 exchange rates for each person. It is said that some students came from afar to take the examination, even leaving their homes and jobs. Now that they cannot go abroad, their expenses are exhausted and they feel extremely miserable.

Because it was a performance, both sides tried their best to show their strengths and did not care about winning or losing. The performances of Wang Huilin, Zhang Xiuli, Sun Fengzhu, and Liu Huishan were praised by the locals for their excellent skills, which were considered no less than those of men. In the end, they each scored 17 points, resulting in a draw. The entire team returned to Shanghai at 5:00 PM, and the Shanghang team returned in triumph.

### Philippine Tennis Tournament

[United Press Manila, 9th] Philippine tennis giant and Davis Cup player Anborn defeated Far Eastern University player Sanchez today with scores of 6-4, 6-0, and 6-2, retaining the 1947 national singles championship.

### Davis Cup Player Cai Huiquan to Participate in Hong Kong Tennis Tournament, Scheduled to Begin on March 10th

[Our Reporter, Hong Kong Dispatch] The annual Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament has been suspended for five consecutive years since 1941. Although it was restored last year, many talented Hong Kong and Chinese tennis players were either working abroad, had not yet returned to Hong Kong, or had not practiced for a long time and were unable to participate. Therefore, it was delayed until this year to resume officially. When the tennis tournament started accepting registrations, people in the tennis community speculated whether Cai Huiquan, our country's Davis Cup player, would also join in the fun. Considering the current tennis talent in Hong Kong and China, Cai Huiquan should be able to dominate. However, the Xu brothers, Huipai and Peirun, are also experts and won the Hong Kong tennis championship in 1941. In addition, Jiang Daozhang, He Jialiu, and Li Huitang were all outstanding players. Jiang Daozhang is also a veteran of the Davis Cup. Foreign tennis experts include the Indian Lin brothers (Xiao Linzhen and Da Linzhen), who have a good reputation. Some British officers have also registered for this competition. Their skills have not yet been revealed in the Hong Kong tennis community, and it is difficult to predict their abilities. However, in any case, the championship of this competition will always belong to Chinese men, and foreigners should not even think about it. A total of 39 people have registered for the singles competition, and 29 pairs have registered for the doubles competition. The competition is scheduled to start on March 10th. At that time, there will be fierce competition on the green lawn of the Hong Kong Cricket Club. In the eyes of Hong Kong people, tennis is considered a "high-class" sport, unlike football, which is enjoyed by all. However, there are still many talented tennis players in Hong Kong and China, and their level seems to be higher than that of Beijing and Shanghai. However, it is not as popular as in Beijing and Shanghai, which is a drawback. Cai Huiquan was originally scheduled to go to England for business reasons recently. If the matter is urgent and cannot be postponed, then he will not be able to participate in this competition.

### International Trade Community Discusses Import-Export Linking System

The International Trade Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the local Import and Export Trade Association held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to discuss the import-export linking system. The goal was to explore its potential contribution after the implementation of the new foreign exchange control measures to alleviate the difficulties currently faced by import trade, which has been completely stagnated. Chairman Shou Jingwei gave a detailed account of the examples of import-export linking systems in various countries and the barter of production raw materials (such as American cotton) with exported manufactured goods (such as cotton textiles exported to Southeast Asia). Subsequently, Ge Jiecun, Li Zongwen, Qiu Liangrong, Tang Jisan, Zhang Xiangfu, Ye Xuxin, Ding Wushi, Shen Gengyuan, Cai Jianwen, Cai Xintao, Yao Nai'an, Wang Dong, Pan Shihao, Zheng Fangzheng, Li Zhenming, Tu Tianjin, and Li Shoulu, among other committee members, analyzed and studied in detail the advantages and disadvantages of the linking system and the points to be noted during its implementation. It was also decided to discuss the "Draft Adjustment of Import and Export Trade Measures" proposed by Mr. Luo Qinghua, the standing director of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, next Thursday (the 13th) and Saturday (the 15th) to gather wisdom and develop a practical and feasible plan for the government and financial authorities to adopt.

### Government Bonds Rise Sharply

Government bonds finally rose yesterday. The 1937 Unified Bonds opened at 8,800 yuan and were immediately sought after, rising to 10,300 yuan before slightly consolidating. The black market price rose to 10,500 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Classes A and B rose by 1,200, Class C rose by 1,300, Class D rose by 2,000, and Class E rose by 1,700. The turnover was about 5 million yuan.

### Eight Types of Government Bonds Drawn for Redemption

Deadline for Supplementary Payment of Overdue Principal and Interest is End of the Month

Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance held a lottery for the redemption of government bonds on the fourth floor of 74 Renji Road. The bonds included the Class B bonds of the 1936 Unified Bonds, the 1928 Financial Long-Term Bonds, the 1936 Reorganization of Guangdong Financial Bonds, the 1936 Sichuan Rehabilitation Bonds, the 1937 Guangdong Province Harbor and River Engineering US Dollar Bonds, the Class A bonds of the 1939 Construction Bonds, the Class B bonds of the 1939 Military Bonds, and the Class C bonds of the 1941 Military Bonds. All winning bonds should have their principal redeemed, except for the 1937 Guangdong Province Harbor and River Engineering US Dollar Bonds, because the Guangdong Customs surtax, which was designated as the redemption and interest payment fund for this bond, was robbed by the enemy and could not be paid. The principal and interest will be temporarily suspended, and the date of resumption of repayment will be determined separately after the bond fund is cleared. In addition, Director Chen reported on the spot that for bondholders of various government bonds in the recovered areas, who were unable to collect the principal and interest within the prescribed three-year period during the war due to the situation, the Ministry of Finance, in order to protect the interests of all bondholders, had previously announced that it would be specially approved for supplementary payment before the end of last year. If the payment was not collected after the deadline, it would be invalidated in accordance with the regulations. Later, at the request of various banks, the supplementary payment period was extended to the end of March of this year. Now that the supplementary payment period is about to expire, bondholders are urged to pay attention.

### Private Applications for Foreign Exchange Will Not Be Accepted

The Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank recently issued a circular to designated foreign exchange banks, stipulating that they should not accept foreign exchange applications in the name of private individuals in the future. In addition, exporters who entrust sales of export products should sell foreign exchange to designated banks within the prescribed period.

### Barter Negotiations with Japan: In Addition to Pit Props and Rayon, Hope to Supply Large Quantities of Newsprint

[Our Reporter] The commissioners sent by the Executive Yuan to Japan to negotiate barter matters will return to the country soon. As of this time, Japan has agreed to supply China with 4 million pit props and 3 million pounds of rayon. China has agreed to supply Japan with 1 million tons of salt, but it is not yet possible to say whether it can be supplied in full. Newsprint is a commodity urgently needed by China, and it is hoped that Japan can supply it in large quantities. However, according to relevant sources, Japan is carrying out the "democratization" of education under the guidance of the Allied Headquarters. Old textbooks have been discarded, and new textbooks are being printed urgently. It needs a large amount of newsprint itself, so it is questionable whether there will be any surplus for export. Only 500 reams have been shipped to China. Regarding the large number of locomotives and carriages that China urgently needs, it is still difficult to achieve in the short term because China cannot supply Japan with large quantities of coal and iron raw materials. However, a small amount of piecemeal supply is still possible.

Also, news: Barter trade with the Soviet Union is an act of China repaying wartime debts, which is divided into two parts: one is the tungsten sand from the Resources Committee, and the other is the ordinary materials exported by the China Trust Bureau, such as tung oil and pig bristles. Last year, the value of goods repaid to the Soviet Union by the China Trust Bureau was only US$10.05 million. The amount to be repaid this year is still in the stage of requesting instructions and seeking the consent of the Soviet Union. However, according to relevant sources, the amount of repayment this year will not exceed last year due to China's current poor economic situation. This repayment work will continue until 1952.

### Tea Merchant Representatives Urge Activation of This Year's Tea Loans

At 11:00 AM this morning, ten tea merchant representatives, including Shou Liangwei, Tang Jisan, Wang Zhenfu, Sun Xiaocun, Wu Juenong, and Hong Chunzhi, will meet with President Zhang Jia'ao of the Central Bank to discuss the following issues: (1) The tea season is approaching, and it is hoped that the tea loans in various provinces this year will be activated quickly. (2) Regarding the tea that has already been purchased, it is hoped that a reasonable price adjustment can be obtained. Regarding the future revaluation, a valuation committee should be formed separately, and the China Trust Bureau should hire tea industry experts to participate.

### Police Bureau Ordered to Crack Down on the Black Market; Bull Market Rages in the Chinese Stock Market

[Our Reporter] Chinese stocks were still being absorbed by speculative funds yesterday, causing short sellers to cover their positions, and the black market outside the stock market became more profitable. The police bureau has been ordered to take decisive measures and will begin to crack down on the black market soon. Although there was a decline in the afternoon as many people took profits, the miscellaneous stocks still showed vitality and were raised again at the close.

Afternoon Session

Nos. 181, 177, 152, 112, 180, and 231 took the opportunity to advance at low prices and began to rise back to 3,200 yuan. At this time, various miscellaneous stocks rose to the limit again, showing that the market was still bullish. Although Nos. 91 and 4 were vigorously sold, Nos. 84, 117, 156, 89, and 219 were added to purchase at the close, and the closing price was still pulled up to 3,290 yuan.

### Import Quota for Newsprint Too Small: Actual Monthly Demand is Over 8,000 Tons, but the Current Quota is Only 3,000 Tons

[Our Reporter] The market price of newsprint reached 130,000 yuan a week ago. Recently, due to high prices and sluggish sales, the price has gradually declined, generally hovering between 105,000 yuan and 110,000 yuan. Roll newsprint is priced at 2,100 yuan per pound. According to a major foreign paper import company in this city, the company ships about 3,000 tons of newsprint from the United States every month, all of which are customer orders. Each ream costs 60,000 yuan, and each pound of roll paper costs 1,200 yuan. The above prices include transportation costs, import and export tariffs, and insurance. However, the loss of interest during the period from ordering to delivery is not included. In addition, the delivery price of European newsprint at the Shanghai dock (excluding interest loss) is already 90,000 yuan per ream. It is estimated that in 1937, the total import volume of newsprint in this city was about 100,000 tons, or about 8,300 tons per month. At present, the monthly import quota for newsprint in this city is only 3,000 tons, which is far from the actual need. It is estimated that the current demand in this city is at least 7,000 tons per month. Moreover, once traffic in other cities is restored, customers will purchase more actively, and the demand will be even greater. It is estimated that the current inventory of newsprint in this city can last for about three months. At present, the production cost of newsprint in domestic paper mills is 2,500 yuan per pound, which is almost double the ordering price from abroad. The production result is not economical. Therefore, the temporary solution seems to be to consider relaxing the import quota for paper.

### Syndicated Export Bill Discounting: First Group Established, Wah Cheng, Hua Kang, and Seven Other Companies Sign Agreement

In order to enable commercial banks to help production enterprises and provide them with opportunities for capital turnover, the Central Bank is handling rediscounting and repledging, using the method of commercial banks organizing industrial and commercial loan syndicates. The number of syndicates organized by commercial banks in this city has reached more than ten groups, with a total of more than 9 billion yuan loaned out. All of them are rediscounted or repledged to the Central Bank at 75% of the original loan amount. In order to encourage the circulation of materials, the bank has also handled repledging of export bills based on the established methods. The export bill discounting syndicates are still organized by commercial banks to apply for repledging from the Central Bank. It is reported that seven Sichuan banks, including Mei Fung, Wah Cheng, Tung Wai, Hua Kang, Chi Kang, Agricultural & Industrial, and Hui Tung, have completed the organization of the first export bill discounting syndicate and formally signed an agreement. The task of the syndicate is to be responsible for reviewing various loans and negotiating with the Central Bank to allow repledging. The export goods pledged by the syndicate members must be limited to daily necessities for people's livelihood and local specialty export commodities, and they must be responsible for guaranteeing that the loan is entirely for the legitimate industrial and commercial needs of the debtors and will not be used for other purposes. The maximum amount of claims submitted to the syndicate by each member is 400 million national currency, and the repledging is calculated at 75%, that is, limited to 300 million national currency. The total amount of loans to industrial and commercial enterprises by each member shall not exceed 100 million national currency. The monthly interest rate on loans is 5%, with a term of 30 days. The discount on export goods is calculated at a maximum of 70% of the market price at the place of origin. The syndicate is jointly and severally liable for the debts owed to the Central Bank by all members. The syndicate will enter into a repledging agreement with the Central Bank.

### Cooking Oil Continues to be Rationed

According to the Cooking Oil Joint Distribution Office, the office has decided to continue to supply cooking oil to retail oil shops this week after consultation with oil manufacturers. It is reported that the distribution of oil in the city center will be decided on the 12th of this month, and each shop will be able to purchase one barrel of soybean oil, with the price still being 250,000 yuan per dan.

(Another News) China Vegetable Oil Factory continued to distribute raw oil to merchants in this city. The numbers distributed were Group C Nos. 401 to 600, who paid the fee yesterday (the 10th). The distribution price was 909,500 yuan per barrel, and the delivery is scheduled for today (the 11th).

### Police Bureau Ordered to Crack Down on Black Market; Bull Market Rages in Chinese Stock Market

### Rice Market Stagnant, Soybean Oil Price Falls by Ten Thousand

Yesterday, the combined North and South markets saw over 14,600 stones of rice arrive, with sluggish sales and a stagnant market, resulting in a downturn. Japonica rice fell by 21,000 yuan, and medium to lower grades continued to drop by 23,000 yuan. Indica rice also weakened by 12,000 yuan. High-grade white rice saw a slight reduction in fixed prices, while lower grades fell by 12,000 yuan. Transactions were minimal, making a recovery difficult in the short term. Flour was supplied as usual with rationed flour, and goods from inland areas continued to gradually decrease, with further price reductions ranging from 300 to 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran remained firm. The oil market, anticipating the arrival of goods from Qingdao, saw a softening of sentiment and a general decline. Soybean oil fell by 10,000 yuan, crude oil plunged by over 10,000 yuan, and refined oil also followed with a smaller drop of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame oil fell by 10,000 yuan.

Yellow beans maintained a stable situation. Soybean cakes from Shantou saw weak demand, and the market was flat. Mung beans remained similar. Red sorghum started firm in the morning but weakened in the afternoon, with prices increasing by 1,000 yuan overall. Corn prices surged at the opening but leveled off by midday, resulting in an overall increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw sluggish demand and continued to weaken by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Sesame seeds remained firm, while broad beans maintained strong sales and stable prices. Red beans were mediocre.

### Fine Yarn Prices Firm and Strong

Yesterday, the yarn market remained calm. Customer sales were still scarce, but there were no signs of weakening sentiment. In particular, 32-count fine yarn saw strong prices due to demand from pure weaving factories. While trading within the market adhered to price limits, private transactions were still unavoidable.

Cotton Fabric Market Weak

Yesterday's cotton fabric market was weak because the tonnage of export shipments had been low in recent days, and some goods were stranded. Customer demand was also stagnant, and due to interest rate considerations, many traders were selling off goods. Moreover, the Textile Construction Company supplied all the fabrics requested by applicants on Saturday, leading to a glut of spot goods and a weak market. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth was priced at 156,000 yuan, and "Five Blessings" cloth at 153,500 yuan, a decrease of 1,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth saw little change. Only "Jumping Carp" bleached cloth saw slightly improved demand in the main street and was relatively firm.

### Woolen and Western Clothing Stores Order White Canvas

Due to high prices and various other factors, actual sales of woolen goods were much lower than at this time in previous years. Most goods owners are importing with difficulty, and goods tax has already been implemented, so public sentiment continues to point upwards. A wide 36-inch domestic white canvas has recently been ordered in large quantities by woolen and Western clothing companies. Over 400 bolts have been ordered through Pei Feng Company at a fixed price of 9,000 yuan per yard, to be delivered within one month. A deposit of 120,000 yuan is paid in advance for each bolt.

### Prices of Oils and Waxes Fluctuate

[Our Report] Today, coconut oil and tallow prices rose again. Asphalt prices were reported to have increased at the origin, but the Shanghai market remained mixed. Coconut oil traded around 450,000 yuan per dan. Bengbu tallow and local tallow were priced between 440,000 and 450,000 yuan per dan. Jiaxing local crude oil was priced at 350,000 yuan per dan. Lanxi and Weiping asphalt were priced between 300,000 and 310,000 yuan per tan. Macheng and Jingbai broken snow saw little trading. Asphalt prices at the origin have all been reported to have increased.

### Qingxu Tobacco Leaf Prices Rise Sharply

[Our Report] Due to transportation difficulties, the arrival of tobacco leaves from Qingzhou and Xuzhou is very scarce. In the last couple of days, prices have risen sharply across the board. Top-grade Xuzhou tobacco leaves are priced at 7,500 yuan per pound, and medium-grade at 7,000 yuan. Top-grade Xuzhou tobacco leaves are priced at 7,200 yuan per pound, and medium-grade at 6,700 yuan, all of which have increased compared to the previous day. American tobacco remains unchanged, ranging from 70 cents to 1.30 US dollars.

### Soap Factory Prices Surge, Factories Distribute Large Quantities

[Our Report] Recently, the soap market has been stable with a hint of weakness. It is reported that Guben Soap distributed a total of 20,000 boxes, with a factory price of 210,000 yuan. Scissors Soap distributed approximately 3,000 boxes, with a factory price of 210,000 yuan. Xiang'e Soap distributed fewer goods, with the total number once rumored to be 50,000 boxes, but later it was heard that only 5,000 to 6,000 boxes were distributed, with a factory price of 155,000 yuan. Nanyang opened its distribution of wooden bucket foot soap at a price of 30,000 yuan, with a factory price of 40,000 yuan. Although oil and alkali prices have recently fallen, the current factory prices are only enough for the soap factories to maintain production costs.

### Coal Dust Prices Rebound After Falling

The coal market saw coal dust prices rebound sharply as actual users frequently bought at low prices, leading to a slight strengthening of the market. However, because sellers were asking for too high prices and buyers were unable to meet them, only sporadic urgent users made some spot purchases, and large-scale transactions were still scarce. White coal briquettes arrived at the Jiaozuo Railway Station, and the market also saw a return to stability. The supply and demand of other goods remained stable, and market prices also saw little change.

### China Trust Bureau to Distribute Second Batch of Artificial Silk

The China Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the Property Committee of the Executive Yuan, distributed the second batch of artificial silk for the silk weaving industry this month yesterday (10th). The brands distributed this time included Zaori, Gaoshan, Toyo, Jin Sanma, and Tianqiao, and the prices remained the same. The quantity distributed was approximately 600 boxes, it is said.

### Supplementary Calculation Method for Adjusting Capital of Industrial and Mining Enterprises to be Announced Soon

[Our Report] After the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced the "Measures for Adjusting Capital by Reassessing the Value of Fixed Assets of Industrial, Mining, and Transportation Enterprises" on December 28th last year, it was deemed necessary to add supplementary regulations to enable various manufacturers to comply. The Accountants Association of this city actively discussed and provided opinions, and the Ministries of Finance and Economics drafted the "Supplementary Calculation Method." It is expected that the Executive Yuan will discuss it in a meeting in the coming days and then announce its implementation. The full draft proposal obtained from relevant parties is as follows:

1.  The "fixed assets" referred to in Article 1 of the Measures include land, buildings, machinery and equipment, models, tools, instruments, furniture, and ships and vehicles.

Shares invested in businesses whose capital has already been adjusted should be listed according to their adjusted share amount and should not be revalued in this enterprise. However, due to time constraints, if the capital of the invested business cannot be adjusted in a timely manner, the maximum amount of the revaluation may be one-fourth of the realizable value of the invested stocks in December of the 25th year of the Republic of China.

### Guangzhou Spring Festival Celebration – Celebrities Appear in Costume – Socialites' Fashion Show – Mrs. Zhang Kuai Plays Xiao Wan – Miss Hu Mu Performs "Striving for National Glory"

— Guangzhou, 2nd (Airmail) — Special Correspondent Liang Feng

After dusk on March 1st, the air was filled with spring rain, and the earth was quiet and still. Only the magnificent Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall was packed with people, and the melodious music mixed with laughter and applause, creating an unprecedentedly lively scene. This was the Guangzhou City Party Members' Spring Festival Celebration. In addition to the leaders of Party, government, and military organs, all the city's Party members attended. They gathered together in harmony, like elders, brothers, sisters, and siblings in a large family, filling the huge venue with love and joy. This was truly a rare grand event after the victory and recovery.

The program of the event was not only unusually rich but also unique. The most remarkable thing was that the city's prominent figures appeared on stage in costume to perform plays. Especially unique was the ancient and modern fashion show in which Director Zhang Fakui's wife Liu Jingrong, Chairman Luo Zhuoying's wife Chen Huiqing, and Mayor Ouyang's wife Yi Yunduan, along with dozens of leading socialites, participated. The ancient costume show began with the "Qin" dynasty and ended with the "Qing" dynasty. Each dynasty selected a woman as a representative figure: "Qin" was Xi Shi, "Former Han" was Zhao Jun, "Later Han" was Diao Chan, "Tang" was Yang Guifei, "Song" was Liang Hongyu, "Yuan" was Hua Mulan, "Ming" was Fei Gongren, and "Qing" was Dong Xiaowan. They played the roles of these figures from different eras, appearing on stage in succession. Some wore brilliant costumes, while others wore simple makeup, creating a colorful and diverse spectacle, transporting the audience to historical settings. A moment later, the modern fashion show brought people back to the world of the atomic age.

In the historical costume show, Director Zhang Fakui's wife played Dong Xiaowan of the Qing dynasty, appearing on stage in a pink Qing costume, earning the most enthusiastic cheers from the audience. The modern fashion show of City Councilor Lu Yougang's wife also received a lot of applause. After the fashion show, there was another exciting program: the two-act play "Striving for National Glory" performed by Wu Zhimei, Luo Canqun, Feng Cihong, Mu Yougang, Gao Xin, Zhu Xiuxia, Hu Mulan, and others. The performance of a character in the play that "governed" the country was the most outstanding. This character was played by Zhu Xiuxia, a member of the Central Committee and Director of the Education Bureau. He grasped the personality of the character very well. He was probably around forty years old, but he played the role of an old man with silver whiskers and hair. His attitude was very realistic. It can be regarded as the most successful performance in the play. Wu Zhimei, a member of the Central Committee, also received considerable praise for playing the wife of the scholar.

At this grand event, one had a strong feeling that the advanced elements united with the younger generation. There were indeed many respected Party and government figures, but there were also many more lively, innocent, and young people. Under one principle and one goal, they broke through the boundaries of age and seniority, fully demonstrating love and sincerity. Therefore, although this was a celebration, in addition to achieving the goal of common entertainment, it really had a profound meaning!

### The Huainan Railway is Full of Spring

— Jiulonggang, 8th (Quick Report) — Zhe Song

Although the section of the Huainan Railway currently in operation is only over eighty kilometers long, crawling in a corner of northeastern Anhui Province, its mission is no less important than that of the neighboring Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, which are crowded with officials and merchants. Every day, it transports coal produced by the Huainan Coal Mine to Bengbu for transshipment southward to supply fuel for transportation and industry. The people in northern and central Anhui, who have suffered greatly after the war and are impoverished, are able to easily import and export their local products and daily necessities, thanks to its continuous transport day and night. The dilapidated villages along the line are also gradually becoming active.

All that the Huai Railway has left by the Japanese enemy is a fragile shell riddled with wounds. It has also suffered from both man-made and natural disasters – the destruction by arsonists and the scouring by the repeated breaches of the dikes last autumn. However, human effort can overcome nature. Finally, thanks to the tireless efforts of Director Wu Jingqing and the hard work of all employees for a year, and under difficult circumstances with special conditions and a lack of resources, they carefully and bravely treated the symptoms, frequently used acupuncture, started businesses from scratch, and brought the dead back to life, enabling the railway to shoulder a huge mission.

Hefei to Shuijiahu Highway Joint Transportation

Hefei is the capital of Anhui Province after the war. The Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau used the original roadbed of the Huai Road Shuijiahu to Yuxikou, which is about 180 kilometers long, as a temporary highway. However, there were not many vehicles, making it difficult to meet actual demand. In order to help develop transportation, the Huai Road authorities agreed with the General Administration of Highways of the Ministry of Transportation to jointly operate highway transportation from Shuijiahu to Hefei and from Hefei to Yuxikou. Vehicles were supplied by the General Administration of Highways, and the service was launched on October 10th of last year. The service had fixed schedules, fixed seating for passengers, and tight team management, which made travel much more convenient for travelers.

Shuijiahu: Is the connecting station between the highway and the railway, but the place is not a market town. Apart from a few food stalls that sprang up in response to the situation and a few restaurants with thatched roofs, firewood doors, earthen walls, and muddy floors with mixed kitchens, it is difficult to find a slightly clean restaurant where people can eat and rest. In addition to working hard on the "travel" aspect, Huai Road also solved the two major problems of "food" and "rest" for waiting passengers. Next to the newly built Shuijiahu station building, several rooms were opened as a reception center, employing famous chefs to regularly provide meals, dishes, and snacks, and preparing candies and snacks for customers to choose from. Shi Jingchang, the person in charge of the reception center, provided thoughtful service, and the waiters were also polite, making travelers forget the fatigue of the journey and the boredom of waiting for the train, creating a "guests are like home" atmosphere. As soon as one enters the reception center, what is revealed to the traveler is Director Wu's handwritten inscription "Diligence, Integrity, Knowledge of Shame" as instructions for the employees. This not only shows the spirit of the new life movement practiced by Zhun Road, but also shows that it is no accident that Zhun Road has achieved this achievement in a short year.

Chairman Zhang and Vice Minister Ling – Official Visits

Spring has finally arrived in the world. Although it is still inevitable that "spring cold is fierce," it is no longer as terrible as the biting north wind. Because of its relatively remote location, the Huai Road rarely sees official visits. However, recently, General Zhang Wenbo, Director of the Northwest Headquarters and Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, and Mr. Ling Zhuming, Vice Minister of Transportation, visited one after another, bringing a lot of spring to the Huai Road and making it feel even more vibrant.

General Zhang took time out of his busy schedule to return to his hometown of Chaoxian County with his wife and others. Although the old home was good, General Zhang, who had a heavy burden on his shoulders, did not allow him to stay there for long. He reluctantly left his hometown on the 18th and went to Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province. After staying in Hefei for one day, he still took a car with Director Wang on the morning of the 20th and headed for Shuijiahu. The Mayor of Bengbu, Li Pinhe, and the Director of the Political Department of the Pacification District, Qiu Guozhen, and others had arrived in Shuijiahu the day before to meet him. When General Zhang's car arrived in Shuijiahu, the special train prepared for General Zhang by the Huai Road – a first-class car manufactured by the road's engine factory, with exquisite equipment and neat arrangement – was already attached behind locomotive No. 108. The road's Director Wu and others had also arrived in advance. At a little past eleven o'clock, General Zhang, who was energetic and had a kind attitude, arrived at the station with his wife. After getting off the car, he shook hands with the welcoming staff one by one to express his gratitude. He was immediately ushered into the reception room. Director Wu first invited him to visit and guide Jiulonggang, but General Zhang politely declined with regret, citing the impossibility of his duties and time. However, from his praise and inquiries about the Huai Road, it can be seen that he was very concerned about it. After being hosted by the Road Bureau for lunch, he shook hands with the public at 12:40 and said goodbye to the people who welcomed him from Bengbu and Hefei, and boarded the train and left the station. At 2:40, this special train of distinguished guests on the Huai Road's maiden voyage arrived in Bengbu.

Vice Minister Pu Fengchen Inspects Huainan

Next, the Huai Road received news that Ling Zhuming, Vice Minister of Transportation, would be leaving to inspect the Jinpu, Longhai, and Huainan lines. This was another scene worth depicting on the Huainan Road. On the 23rd, Vice Director Ning Shufan of the Huai Road led the heads of the engineering and mechanical departments to Bengbu by car to welcome him and to facilitate pointing out everything along the way. The next morning, Vice Minister Ling and his entourage, as well as Shen Wensi, Vice Director of the Jinpu Road and Director of the Puyan Section Management Office, returned south to Bengbu from inspecting the northern section of the Jinpu Road. When the special train entered the station, Vice Director Ning and others immediately went forward to welcome him. The special train then backed into the Huai Road platform and was attached to the first-class car of the Huai Road. This train, with the first-class passenger car of Huainan, the sleeper car of Jinpu, the official affairs vehicle of Longhai, and a special car with windows broken on all sides, gathered different vehicles from the three lines. This was enough to symbolize the "exchange" and "smoothness" of the three lines, and more clearly indicated the course of Ling's inspection this time. The special train was changed to be pulled by the Huai Road locomotive and departed at 6:30. Mr. Ling was energetic. Although he had been traveling all day, he showed no signs of fatigue. The inspection of the various lines and the national policy of revitalizing transportation must have a very big relationship, so the Huai Road authorities and many employees expressed their enthusiasm for the arrival of Mr. Ling and had the hope of "it will benefit our road." For the sake of the order and time of the visit, the special train drove directly to Tianjia'an, the end point of the Huai Road on the Huainan bank.

Tianjia'an Datong Mine is Thriving

Tianjia'an was originally a township. Since the opening of the Huai Road, it has become an important land and water transportation hub. Merchants gather there, and it has gradually prospered, forming a new rising town along the Huai River. During the period of the fall into enemy hands, because the Huainan mining road was used by the enemy, the residents, although living an inhuman life under the oppression of the fierce power, the place still did not lose its importance. After the victory, the wanderers for eight years returned one after another, and it was even more prosperous. The Anhui Tenth District Commissioner's Office was ordered to move here last year. Regarding the development of the city, the special department presided over the matter and convened local people and the Huainan Road and Mining authorities to discuss and plan, which is being implemented step by step. Among the original station buildings of the Huai Road, only three places, this place and Datong Jiulonggang, were fortunately preserved. On the southwest side of the station, two tall factory buildings stand towering, one is the Huainan Power Plant, which supplies electricity to the working places of various parts of the Datong Jiulonggang mining road day and night, as well as electric lights in various places, and the other is the Huainan Flour Mill, which was established not long ago to supply products to the rolling road employees. These are all constructions of the Huainan Mining and Road Company authorities, operating with difficulty, for the purpose of promoting the development of the mining road and local prosperity. After Vice Minister Ling visited them separately, he praised them greatly. At 10:30, the special train returned to Datong.

Before the war, the Datong Coal Mine was operated by the Datong Coal Mine Company, which is nearly five kilometers from the Jiulonggang. After the war, the Huainan and Datong mines were merged and belonged to one of the main mining areas of the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau. All the equipment has been changed during the enemy's occupation. The enemy intended to seize coal quickly, and most of the mining projects were unreasonable, so after the takeover, the Mining Bureau spent a lot of hard work to repair them. Now the output has gradually increased. Whenever Vice Minister Ling visited a place, General Manager Cheng and the Deputy Directors of the Mining Bureau, Li Jing and Hu Shitong, and others described the working conditions of each department in detail. Mr. Ling attached great importance to and cared about it.

New Inspiration for Jiulonggang Engine Factory

At 11:20, the vehicle returned to Jiulonggang Station. They took small Jeeps and drove to the reception center. After resting for a while, they held a public banquet. In a joyful atmosphere, the guests and hosts raised their glasses to congratulate each other. The focus of everyone's conversation was the past history of the Huainan Road and Mining, and the future plans, especially the problem of the restoration of the railway from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou. Director Ling indicated everything very sincerely and frankly because the Huai Road has a close relationship with state-owned and private transportation construction and industrial enterprises, and promised to provide assistance within the possible range. At the public banquet, he and Deputy Director Shen both gave speeches. After the temporary division, General Manager Cheng, Director Wu, and others led the visit to the office. This is a house overlooking the Huainan Mining and Road area, but now the bureaus of the Mining and Road are gradually increasing with the development of business, and it is not enough to allocate them, so the engineering and mechanical departments of the Road Bureau and some parts of the general affairs and transportation departments are all in other houses to work.

After leaving the office, they turned into the Road Bureau's Jiunenggang Engine Factory. Factory Director Liu Xinmin is young and energetic. From his conversation, it can be known that he is a mechanical engineering talent with a clear mind and a pragmatic and hard-working attitude. According to Factory Director Liu's report, when the factory was taken over, the buildings were incomplete, and broken parts were piled up all over the ground. Only one-third of all the machines could be used. After a year of sorting and repairing, all of them are now available. In the early stage of the takeover, the equipment and materials of the engine factory were extremely disorganized. Later, the work departments were adjusted and divided into four shares: general affairs, accounting, materials, and work; and seven work yards: locomotive, vehicle, foundry, forging, boiler, electrical, and mechanical. There are currently 51 employees, 478 technicians and laborers. When visiting, the workers in each work yard were busy doing their respective duties. A great locomotive yard, covering an area of about 1,800 square meters, only had a skeleton when it was taken over. Now it has been repaired and completed, and there are two passenger car frames that are being rushed to install first and second class and third class passenger cars. In addition to being responsible for repairing and manufacturing the vehicles and parts on this road, the factory plans to accept commissioned repairs of parts from outside the world. In this complex situation, it is more than enough to be clear and orderly. In every corner, every worker shows a regular, tidy, and tense spirit. No wonder Vice Minister Ling nodded frequently and praised it without end. The engine factory is next door to the Jiulonggang Engine Section. Stepping into the iron gate, there is a long coal trunk passage. The office and strip car yard are built next to it. It has the same work tension as the engine factory and the same orderliness.

"It is difficult for Liu Tiaoer to attack the Hyacinth," Vice Minister Ling's special train left from Longgang in a long whistle, high military music, and a line of respectful farewells. Although Vice Minister Ling only stayed at Huai Road for half a day, the impressions he gained and the inspiration he gave to Huai Road were very profound.

Editor's note: This newspaper has recorded the work of the Huainan Coalfield Exploration Team of the Mineral Exploration Department of the Resources Committee. According to a letter from reader Yang Wenzun, we learned the details of the team, and we specially transcribed its main points as follows:

(1) The original name of the exploration team was the Huainan Coalfield Exploration Team of the Mineral Exploration Department of the Resources Committee. At least five exploration teams have been dispatched from the Mineral Exploration Hall, and we are one of them.

(2) Exploring Huainan is one of the plans of this office for the 35th year of the Republic of China. The report that "Mr. Xie Jiarong's visit to Huainan was only for sightseeing" is obviously hearsay.

(3) The exploration team was led by Yan Shutuan, Deputy Engineer of the Mineral Exploration Department. All the members of the team were sent here by the Exploration Department from Beijing. The Huainan Mining Bureau sent a general affairs officer, a police officer from the Mining Police Station, and six mining police. The exploration team works in the thatched houses of the people for 12 hours a day.

Mr. Yang is one of the members of the exploration team. In addition to actually participating in the work, he enthusiastically pointed out the above situation, which is commendable. We attach this note to express our gratitude.

Attention to Those Purchasing Canned Food

Editor: Recently, cheap milk powder and various canned foods have been sold everywhere in shops and stalls. Aside from canned meals, which are easily detected as rotten or moldy upon opening and thus unlikely to be mistakenly consumed, powdered milk is, in our experience, unreliable. A friend of mine suffering from a lung disease mistakenly consumed this milk and suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension for half a month. Their previously reduced fever increased instead. After repeated investigation, it was discovered that they had mistakenly consumed expired milk. The same occurred after consuming milk powder. I occasionally ate it a few times and also suffered from similar symptoms, but my body is stronger, so it wasn't as severe as for the sick person. Rumor has it that these various canned goods recently came from the Ryukyu Islands, mostly from around 1943, and are now past their expiration date and potentially toxic. We hope citizens will pay attention. Or, we request that the health authorities issue a public notice! (A Shanghai citizen)

Private School Teachers Request Allocation of Goods in Kind

The newspaper reports that private school teachers and cultural figures are excluded from the allocation of goods in kind. This is truly baffling. Are private school teachers not also working for education? Today, prices are rising steadily, and private school teachers' salaries were determined at the beginning of the semester and cannot be adjusted during the semester. Especially in schools in the southern part of the city, which are located in humble alleys, tuition fees cannot be set too high, and the salaries are three or four times lower than in other districts. To this day, a salary of 200,000 yuan per month is common. We jointly appeal to the government to grant the same treatment as public schools. (Wang Bannong and others, teachers and staff of private schools in the southern part of the city) Editor's note: A similar letter from Li Weixi and others, teachers at private schools, will not be published again.

The Corrupt and Despicable Mentality Should Be Corrected

In today's society, everyone is no longer surprised by corruption and bribery, considering it an inevitable phenomenon at a certain stage. Unless such corrupt behavior directly or indirectly causes them loss, they are simply not interested. This has become a common practice over the years, numbing people's nerves.

For example, when someone is appointed to a tax-related position, their friends and relatives all congratulate them on getting a "lucrative post." They clearly know that a "lucrative post" means a position with abundant extra income. They also know that the actual salary of this position cannot be described as "lucrative." So, what are they referring to? Their minds are already filled with thoughts of corruption. Knowing it is corrupt, they still go to congratulate, which is truly a very painful thing. Not long ago, a foreigner came to our country to investigate politics and said after returning home that "corruption is prevalent in Chinese officialdom." However, he had not yet realized that the minds of the Chinese people had also been dyed black by the color of corruption.

With the exception of an absolute minority, the thoughts and actions of the general public have become distorted and unbearable, from neglecting their own responsibilities to engaging in profiteering and indulging in pleasure. Just take any public utility agency as an example. The people in charge should be extra diligent in their work because they are serving the public. However, the opposite is true; they are perfunctory and shirk their responsibilities. Perhaps it is because of the low salary that they are unwilling to work hard. However, is it right that the masses should suffer negative impacts because of the dissatisfaction of a few people with their positions? With such people, how can we hope for a good society? It is very difficult. General cynics often criticize the shortcomings of the government but ignore the potential of the people's distorted thoughts.

All wars in the world originate from "greed." Now, how can a country with a majority of people who are "greedy" and "do not think of the public" extinguish the flames of war and create a sound national organization? The people of the country pray for peace and happiness every day, but they are paying with checks for "corruption" and "irresponsibility." Such a transaction will not succeed. (Jin Jiaping)

The Muddy Luofu Road Awaits Repair

Editor: At the previous meeting of the City Council, a proposal was made to repair roads in various districts, including Tiantong Road and Shanxi Road, and the Bureau of Public Works was instructed to handle them according to their importance. Luofu Road in Hongkou was originally a cross street paved with long square stones. During the enemy puppet regime, the houses on the other side of the road collapsed, and it has since become a vacant ruin filled with garbage. Recently, many bungalows have been built. However, these bungalows do not have drainage ditches, so all the dirty water is poured onto the road, and over time, it has clogged the main drainage ditch, causing the water in the ditch to overflow onto the road, turning it into a mud pit that is difficult to walk on even on sunny days. We hope that the Bureau of Public Works will include this in the repair plan to benefit the people. (All residents of Luofu Road)

Consumer Cooperatives Need to Be Rectified

Editor:

I read in your newspaper's Reader Opinions column that it encourages the widespread establishment of consumer cooperatives, which I greatly sympathize with. I learned that the authorities in District 19 (Yulin District) of this city initiated the organization of a consumer cooperative after the victory, and it has been established for nearly a year, but it has only distributed irrelevant daily necessities five or six times. When distributing, it does not notify all members, so many members miss out. It has now been silent for three months and exists in name only. At this time of transition between the old and new district chiefs in our district, please ask the new district chief to promptly take over the cooperative, rectify it, and earnestly handle the distribution of daily necessities so that members can enjoy real benefits. (A certain Jia Chief)

The Zhenbei Road Bridge Needs Urgent Repair

Editor:

Zhenbei Road is an important transportation route between Beixinjing and Zhenru. There are several bridges on this highway, commonly known as Bridge No. 2, Bridge No. 3, and Bridge No. 4. They are all made of wood. Since the enemy puppet regime until now, people have been crossing them with trepidation. One day, I was passing over Bridge No. 3 when, due to the dilapidated bridge surface being unevenly balanced, I unfortunately fell into the river. Therefore, fearing that others will repeat my experience, I specifically ask for a corner of your newspaper to appeal to the relevant authorities to urge urgent repairs to facilitate transportation. (Long Binyuan)

Answers to Questions Regarding Student Screening

Regarding the questions raised by Mr. Shen Yun'ou regarding student screening, here are the answers item by item: (1) Those who have not been screened cannot be changed to regular students, regardless of their entrance examination results. (2) The city will hold the third screening in the near future, but the date has not yet been decided. (3) The Ministry's order stipulates that high schools are not allowed to recruit transfer students in the second semester of the third year. If schools violate this order, the education administrative authorities will not issue graduation certificates. (4) The rumors are inaccurate.

Improved Sanitation in Jingyuan Village

Regarding the article "Jingyuan Village Needs to Improve Sanitation" submitted by reader Mr. Wang Junhao, after it was published, we received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau stating: "We ordered the 8th Squadron of the Cleaning Corps to investigate, and it was reported that there was no dumping of garbage cans in the alley. We searched everywhere for Mr. Wang Junhao but could not find him. We issued a certificate proving the sanitary condition of the alley, which has been improved." We hereby publish this.

Spring and Autumn

### Preface to Mr. Wu Tiecheng of Zhongshan on His Sixtieth Birthday

— Congratulated by Zhang Qun and 120 Others

The mountains and rivers of the Lingnan region are magnificent, and the spirit of the people is vigorous. The gods have blessed this place, producing heroes in every generation. In the past, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, was destined to be a world-changing figure. Entrusted with a great mission and facing great difficulties, he used his God-given wisdom to advocate justice to the world, thereby laying the foundation for a republic and creating a democratic framework. His path is like the sun and moon traversing the sky, enduring for centuries without fading. Our President Chiang Kai-shek inherited his legacy, gathered great forces, and united the world against a common enemy, achieving final victory. His power awed enemy nations, and his military righteousness was valued by allied nations. He was able to rebuild China, restore the glory of Yu, and his great achievements shine throughout the world. Since the invention of writing, there has been no one to compare with him! From the era of reforming the old and ushering in the new to the autumn of resisting foreign aggression and defending the nation, the period was long and the encounters were difficult. However, those who shared the same heart to save the country and assisted His Excellency's virtues, whose merits are recorded on banners and whose names are passed down in history, are none other than Mr. Wu of Zhongshan! Mr. Wu, born of the illustrious Yanling clan and descended from the stars of Lingnan, dedicated himself to the Party and the nation, and his meritorious achievements are evident. Everyone looks up to him, and all follow his example. The higher his age, the greater his virtue; the more his reputation grows, the more humble his actions become. His benevolence extends far, so his blessings are lasting; his accomplishments are many, so his self-cultivation is great. Spreading benevolence will surely bring great fortune, and accomplishing things should lead to longevity. Great virtue is born daily, and only the benevolent live long. This is the eternal principle of Heaven and the supreme principle of human relations. Mr. Wu surpassed others in his youth and displayed his talent at an early age. He revealed his brilliance early on and harbored grand strategies. At that time, the Qing government was corrupt and foreign insults were increasing daily. He aspired to restore China and purify the world. Moreover, he was a descendant of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, of the same clan and of a family with a long history. He admired and respected Dr. Sun, and early on he followed the revolution, experiencing dangers and obstacles. His loyalty was as firm as gold and stone, and his spirit soared through the clouds. He challenged the sky, planting the first banner in Lingnan; the dragons fought in the wilderness, revealing his righteous duties in Xunyang; he and the late Chairman Lin advocated general elections, supported the Southern Capital, and represented the people of Jiangxi, sincerely expressing their loyalty. The Six Dynasties added to the splendor of the mountains and rivers, and the four seas comforted the hope of the clouds! This is the first reason why assisting Dr. Sun Yat-sen will surely bring him longevity. When Yuan Shikai stole the country, Heaven and man were furious. Mr. Wu went into exile overseas, calling on the people of the world to avenge the enemy and eliminate the wicked traitor. As for the troops who fought against the rebels in Yunnan and the efforts to protect the constitution in Guangdong, he either planned from afar or participated in person. Moreover, he understood military strategy and was well-versed in the art of war. He commanded troops with ease, and his escort had the merit of alerting the way. The city of Guangzhou was peaceful, and he achieved the merit of protecting the people. When the Northern Expedition began and the Central Plains were pacified, Youyan formed a confrontational situation, and the Northeast had a stronghold to rely on. Mr. Wu moved them with sincerity and enlightened them with righteousness, causing them to awaken and resolutely return. Thus began the movement to change the flag in the Northeast. Turning swords into jade and silk, a cup of wine was better than a million soldiers; transforming the atmosphere of war into brilliance, laughter laid the foundation for the situation in Kyushu! This is the second reason why promoting unification will surely bring him longevity. During the January 28th Incident, Mr. Wu was the mayor of Shanghai. He responded to the difficulties, forgetting sleep and food, and his efforts to mediate were effective, turning danger into safety. He then governed according to the times, treating everything as if it were spring, and his benevolence covered both Chinese and foreigners, and his reputation spread far and wide. He built sports fields, showing the path to healthy living; he focused on the central district, establishing a grand blueprint. In the past, we could imagine his towering wisdom, and today we see his great spirit. He was entrusted with an important mission in Lingnan, adding glory to his hometown; he issued proclamations in Guangdong, providing shelter to the people. At that time, smoke and dust filled the air, and beacon fires were frequent. Mr. Wu comforted the local people, encouraging the military and civilians to strengthen their determination to fight the enemy and to encourage each other with the spirit of being the source of the revolution. He still felt responsible for the hunger and drowning of others and cared for the sick. He added grace to those in need and warmed the wounded, spreading his virtue and promoting his benevolence! This is the third reason why spreading grace will surely bring him longevity. Our Chinese people are far from their homeland, pioneering distant lands. With simple tools, they have seen the difficult journey of entrepreneurship; braving the wind and rain, they have achieved admirable business performance. Because they lack the protection of their motherland, they have suffered foreign aggression. Our President expanded his benevolence like the sky, not abandoning distant lands. He sympathized with the love of his compatriots and understood the feelings of overseas Chinese in his heart. Therefore, Mr. Wu, with the heavy responsibility of Fan Han and as a founding member of the Party, was ordered to travel quickly. He conveyed condolences with eloquent words. Wherever he went, people bowed down and cheered, welcoming him with the ceremony of a state guest or respecting him with the etiquette of a prince. Mr. Wu traveled throughout Southeast Asia, diligently caring for overseas Chinese, encouraging them to abide by the law and respect etiquette, and urging neighboring countries to emphasize honesty and integrity. His words were strict and his righteousness was upright, and his reputation was established in foreign lands, and his sincerity was trusted in foreign lands. The overseas Chinese were inspired by this, strengthening their love for their motherland. Neighboring countries were inspired by this, strengthening their respect for the Chinese people. Bo Wang rode a raft, but he was inferior to this far-sighted strategy; Zheng He had a large fleet, but he did not have this far-reaching plan! This is the fourth reason why helping overseas Chinese will surely bring him longevity. The world situation is chaotic and ever-changing, and diplomatic responses are very different from usual. Mr. Wu has high ambitions and foresight, seeing the situation ahead. He examines the national situation internally and gathers opinions from all sides. He uses his wisdom to analyze the country like dissecting hairs; he uses his divine intuition to predict events like knowing the future, and he assumes the responsibilities of the border and advises the core. The grass and trees know his name, and the oceans also ask about his whereabouts. He treats distant lands with virtue and touches people deeply. Because his meritorious achievements are great, his admiration is even greater. He promotes friendly alliances and repairs good relations with neighboring countries, seeking friendship with countries during banquets and deepening friendship during observation meetings. His carriage is noisy in the streets, and his hat and robes are seen in public halls. He takes the perspective of an observer and achieves the effect of diligent work; he takes a side stance and obtains the effect of joyful unity. He is able to coordinate with national policies, win sympathy, join hands with the Allied forces to lead the way, and advance shoulder to shoulder with friendly nations! This is the fifth reason why assisting diplomacy will surely bring him longevity. Our Party leads the revolution with hardship and determination, using a spirit of perseverance to make unswerving efforts. It has created a brilliant history for the nation and a prosperous and happy future for the country. Mr. Wu has dedicated himself to the Party, becoming stronger in his old age. His personal life is entrusted to the life of the Party; his personal career is based on the career of the Party. When the country is in turmoil and public opinion is agitated, Mr. Wu is ordered to preside over Party affairs. He encourages comrades to protect the Party and to serve the country. He unites Party friendship, cultivates Party virtue, rectifies Party discipline, elucidates the Party program, and greatly displays the Party's achievements and promotes the Party's glory. In the future, he will further promote the Party, making it great and vigorous, standing side by side with Mount Tai and Mount Dai, and enduring with China! This is the sixth reason why dedicating himself to the Party will surely bring him longevity. However, the highest virtue is like a valley, and the great path is boundless. Like the rain nourishing all grains, it does not consider itself to be a blessing; like the spring breeze blowing on all things, it does not consider itself to be a merit. Mr. Wu presides over major plans, assisting in the revival of the country. Although the governance depends on yin and yang, his fear is deeper than frost and dew. He worries and works hard, following the sincerity of the Zhou dynasty's Ji Dan; he reflects on the difficulties, taking the warning of Wei Wu's restraint; he seeks talent like soup, spitting out food to invite guests; he accepts good advice like a stream, praising good words and monopolizing beauty. He is generous in his demeanor and tolerant, so he can encompass all directions and embrace the universe. All of these auspicious signs are signs of benevolence and longevity. Recently, internal strife has not ceased, and external criticism is ongoing, causing hardship for the people and difficulty in making progress. Mr. Wu is eager for unification, negotiating for peace, respecting the great righteousness of democracy, and guiding the grand regulations of constitutional consultation, establishing merit and virtue, leaving behind a righteous tomb for thousands of years; bringing longevity to the world and the people, creating boundless blessings for hundreds of millions. It is appropriate to list the Hongfan, preparing the auspiciousness of the ninety-fifth, shading the spiritual Toon tree, extending the years of eight thousand! Now, celebrating his sixtieth birthday, meeting a prosperous time, the Di Xiang Shrine competes to offer trees of longevity, and the Du Gong Birthday Hall praises the longevity cup! The groups are either comrades-in-arms or bound by affection, daily admiring the sun and moving forward to offer chapters of the Heaven-Protected; praising the winds of Tai and Lai, competing to imitate the blessings of the border people. We wish to celebrate every year, always celebrating birthdays with hundreds of flowers; and we also predict that he will be promoted every year, forever remaining in the long spring of March! Guo Ziyi assisted the Tang Dynasty, and all the officials imitated the call of Mount Song; Wen Yanbo assisted the Song Dynasty, and the nine prefectures offered songs of Mount Ganglu. This is the preface. Congratulated by Zhang Qun and 120 others. March, the thirtieth year of the Republic of China

### Bookstore Clerk

— Ma Xiang

I've wanted to be a bookstore clerk for a long time. Long, long ago, I asked my teacher to try to find a way for me to work at major bookstores in Shanghai.

Now, I unexpectedly became a clerk at a bookstore in this metropolis, a place where talent gathers. Sitting at the accounting desk in the bookstore, no customer would mistake me for anything other than a bookstore clerk, and one in charge of accounting at that.

Being a bookstore clerk is really great. Whoever walks into a bookstore is probably an intellectual (at least not illiterate). Since I like to chat, I've made quite a few friends. I've also learned about various people's criticisms and preferences for different books.

Sometimes, when the boss gets a big batch of new books, sorting them is secondary. The first thing is to set the price. Seeing a good book with a cost price of 500 yuan, the boss knows that since it's "good," the price must be 2,000 yuan. If the boss is good, then we clerks are good too. If the price is too high and sales are slow, we can leisurely skim through it a couple of times.

After sorting and pricing, the next step is to read the books yourself! Which good book should my greedy eyes feast on first? At this moment, I'm reminded of seeing officials naked while eating in the bathhouse. Why don't they wear pants when eating? Oh! Now I understand: that's a kind of pride. If I weren't a bookstore clerk, how could I read so many new books one by one, according to my own preferences, without spending a dime? Movie theater employees watching movies, carpenter masters fixing short stools, it's all the same principle, right?

Speaking of which, sometimes because there are too many new books, it's too casual to just pick up one to read. As a result, there are books everywhere, east and west. I read "Best One-Act Plays" while lying down. I used Dr. Hu Shi's "History of Vernacular Literature" as a sleeping aid before bed. Although I know that Dr. Eddy's "Youth and Sexuality" is a good book, it's an academic paper, so it's too boring to read and I often have to cut it short. The two books I read earlier, "Wenxin" and Shen Congwen's "Xiangxing Sanji," were eclipsed by "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Dream of the Red Chamber," which I read to enrich my topics for chatting with customers. After finishing "Xiangxing Sanji," I wanted to read "Moonlight Sketches," but another clerk grabbed it halfway, so I had to pause for a moment. Someone said Zhang Tianyi's "Pursuit" is good, so I want to read it. "Midnight," which is next to "Pursuit" on the bookshelf, also seems to be beckoning to me. I want to read the three thick volumes of "Torrent." After reading Gorky's "Mother," I can't not read "People." I also need to read some plays. I've been reading "Song of Righteousness" for a long time, but "Snowy Night Return" is unfamiliar. Zang Kejia's poetry collection is also one of my favorites, and I'm determined to read it.

I'm now also in charge of handling money, so I should probably learn some accounting. Since the store has books on English and Russian, why should I give up without even flipping through them? I must, I must study them carefully. ... Wow! So many books, a thousand threads, where do I start?

The most regrettable thing is when a book that I decided to read but haven't gotten around to yet is bought by a customer. And there's only one copy in the store. One copy of "Principles of Accounting" was wrapped up and reluctantly handed to the customer under this kind of psychology.

I'm gradually becoming more like a clerk, more like a bookstore clerk. What I lack is the lying and exaggerating skills that merchants usually have. I'm still clumsy and slow in that regard.

Being a bookstore clerk is really great. One day, I was flipping through "The Good Earth," reading about Wang Lung entering the city and talking about his past and future with Lotus, when suddenly the boss patted me on the shoulder:

"Hey: A customer is here."

### Dove Bell

— Xuan Yi

I yearn for that clear, melodious bell sound.

When the wind of late March brushes the green grass of the fields, when the wind of late March brushes the red flowers of the fields, when the sky of March floats with white clouds like light catkins, have you ever yearned for the blue sky, the flock of pigeons soaring across the sky, the clear bell sound left behind by the flock of pigeons?

A person who loves freedom, how much he yearns for this clear sound!

The dove bell is a long, lingering echo, it ripples in the waves of your heart, and then you will lean by the window and remember friends wandering on the horizon, childhood companions collecting cattle on the banks of their hometown river, and those long-ago, warm love affairs full of the feelings of May...

White pigeons soar in the boundless sky, living freely.

You, a person who loves freedom! How can you not yearn for that clear, melodious dove bell!

### Early Spring Notes

— Zhong Yuan

Spring has come. An unknown plant outside the window has bloomed with a few small yellow flowers.

I wanted to pick those little flowers several times. I wanted to put them in a green bottle. I wanted to place them on the table next to my desk. Then, in the morning, at quiet nights, in moments of loneliness, boredom, or pain, my soul could board those little flowers, like the children in "The Blue Bird" inserting thin, light feathers, able to fly out of the window at any time, fly to the distant horizon, to look for some strange, beautiful lost dreams. ...

But I didn't do that. I slammed the window shut and laughed, laughing at my own foolishness!

But I immediately stopped smiling. I looked at an unfinished manuscript on my desk and laughed, crying at my own uselessness and lack of talent!

I silently lay down on the bed, tilted my head, and quietly watched the tightly closed window frame. The window frame was covered with white paint, and there was a small hole in a peeling patch of white paint on the glass. I knew: as long as my eyes were close to the hole, I could still glimpse the beautiful blue sky outside, the white clouds under the blue sky, and the small birds leisurely flying from below. ...

I also know: when the morning sun rises, and the sky is filled with scarlet red light, the birds still sing, and the willow branches still sway. The red roses still emit a refreshing fragrance. The colorful wildflowers and green grass are still as vibrant and magnificent as before!

I also know: on a night of dense stars and shimmering light, the graceful white clouds drift with the wind. At that time, a crescent moon hangs diagonally in the middle of the sky, shooting down a piece of pure white light, like a silver gauze blanket, covering the earth. At that time, the grass rests, and the flowers sleep. The birds hide in their warm nests, making strange and mysterious songs in their dreams: "Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp..."

The spring garden! Inexhaustible scenery and poetic imagery! Why did I close the window of "tenderness" so early? Even the small "remembrance" hole, I let it coldly waste away?

Lying in bed, asking myself. Seemingly unable to answer. Getting up, sitting at the desk, holding a pen, thinking hard, I finally wrote these lines on paper: ——

I closed the window of tenderness early,

Because empty dreams only make me cry.

I would rather let the hole of memory coldly waste away,

Because there is greater work before me.

The times are iron-cast giants,

Carrying the train of life forward with full force!

Climbing the high mountain of career,

Turning my head back,

Tenderness and remembrance, ——

Two shooting stars flashing in the smoke and dust,

Gone in a moment!

### Friend of China, Historian René Grousset

— Xu Zhongnian

In mid-January 1930, I had just finished my thesis at the University of Lyon in France when I received a telegram from Mr. René Grousset in Paris, inviting me to come to Paris for a visit. I had never met Mr. Grousset before; all I knew was that he was a scholar of Oriental languages. When I arrived in Paris and met him, I learned that he was born in 1885 in the beautiful city of Grenoble and was currently the Deputy Curator of the Musée Guimet. He was revising his "Histoire d'Extrême-Orient" (History of the Far East). On the other hand, Mr. Charles-Henry Hirsch, a novelist from "Mercure de France," the stronghold of the Symbolist movement, whom I had also never met, also invited me to Paris. Through Mr. Grousset's introduction, I met many Sinologists, such as Paul Pelliot, Henri Maspero, and Goulobev, etc. Through Mr. Hirsch's introduction, I entered "Mercure" and met many literary figures, such as André Gide and the Comtesse de Noailles, etc. For more than a decade, I have been turning around like an ant on a millstone, and I am ashamed of having achieved nothing, but the feeling of friendship cannot be forgotten!

Mr. Grousset is a historian of the Orient (Near East and Far East). His works are all major works. Before "Histoire d'Extrême-Orient," there was "Histoired'Asie" (History of Asia), which was his seminal work. After "Histoire d'Extrême-Orient," there was also "Reveild'Asie" (The Awakening of Asia), which expressed great sympathy for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the establishment of the Republic of China; "Sur les traces du Bouddha" (In the Footsteps of the Buddha), which mentioned the Tang Dynasty Buddhist Monk Xuanzang and other Chinese holy monks; "Civilisations d'Extrême-Orient" (Civilizations of the Far East), in which Chinese culture occupies a very important position; "Histoire des Croisades" (History of the Crusades), which paid special attention to the exchange of Eastern and Western cultures. In 1944, the Académie Française awarded Mr. Grousset the "Prix Louis Barthou." Louis Barthou was a historian and diplomat who had formed a cabinet, served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and was also a member of the Académie Française.

Mr. Grousset was promoted from Deputy Curator of the Musée Guimet to Curator of the Musée Cernuschi. At the end of 1945, the Académie Française elected him as a member: this is the highest honor a French writer can receive.

Anyone who has been to Chongqing will remember Vadime Elisseeff, the former cultural attaché of the French Embassy, who took a Chinese name: Ye Lifu, and his fiancée, Miss Francine Caullery. This young Sinologist (a student of Paul Pelliot) is Mr. Grousset's adopted son. In February 1946, Mr. Grousset retired and summoned Mr. Ye Lifu back to Paris to succeed him in his position.

It seems that few people in China know such a person who cherishes China: this is unfair! It is true that his research on Chinese culture is not meant to be known, but from our Chinese standpoint, we cannot help but be grateful to him: this is the reason why I wrote this introductory article. (Nanjing; March 4, 1947)

### Every Inch of Mountain and River, Every Drop of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 195

As she struck this pose, the two guards standing behind her also writhed like maggots, coordinating with her movements, as if cheering her on.

"Oh... I presume you are the commander of the Garrison Headquarters?" Tsurumi asked with a grin.

"Hmm...!" Her voice was short and abrupt, probably because she was so angry that she was about to explode.

"Then may I ask your honorable name?" Tsurumi asked, bowing.

"Commander Jin, haven't you heard of it?" – This was Kawashima Yoshiko's nickname. I was surprised.

"Oh, Commander Jin, Jin Bihui?" Tsurumi seemed to be appreciating her curves, looking her up and down, as if saying "seeing is not as good as hearing."

Wasn't Jin Bihui the Kawashima Yoshiko who sold everything? I was not lucky enough to meet this female rascal. When I heard Tsurumi mention her alias, I was shocked. Yaoqun next to me was probably also shocked, but then I heard her sneer, expressing contempt. Even Little Tiger was startled. But I was sure that he had never heard of this name, let alone knew what Kawashima Yoshiko was, so his surprise was probably influenced by me and Yaoqun.

"... Please report your name as well!" She was extremely impatient.

"I dare not, Tsurumi Tama, Chief Designer of the General Staff Headquarters."

"Oh... so it's Chief Tsurumi." She changed to Japanese, changed her tone, and changed her attitude. Most of it was surprise, a small part was relief. In the relief, there was also some suspicion. This mixed expression was completely revealed in her sinister and cunning eyes as they flickered.

Why the surprise? Probably because she had admired the name for a long time and finally met the person today. Why the relief? I can't say for sure, maybe it's like a hunter seeing a big worm he's tracking? Then why the suspicion? Perhaps Tsurumi's appearance seemed out of place, and his style was not enough. Maybe he was impersonating and using a false name.

"I dare not, I dare not!" Tsurumi only said these four words and then stopped abruptly. Although he was also speaking Japanese, the tone of the Japanese was even more unpleasant than the Korean-Shandong accent of our big guy "Zero Four."

Although the situation was quite tense, I couldn't help but laugh when I heard Tsurumi's prank. I knew very well that Tsurumi was deliberately teasing, probably preparing to joke with this female commander.

"What do you say, Mr. Yue?" Yaoqun asked me quietly. I was just about to tell Yaoqun what I guessed when I suddenly saw her eyes fixed, her expression stern, as if she had discovered an extremely terrifying scene. At the same time, her lips trembled, silently mumbling, her voice almost too faint to hear:

"Comrades... prepare to act...!!"

Hearing Yaoqun say this, I was shocked and doubtful. There were no alarm devices here; no red lights, and no hissing sounds. Looking at Yaoqun carefully again, I saw that her eyes were fixed, as if she had been hypnotized into the second stage of trance.

Seeing that the situation was not right, I was afraid that a master was secretly plotting against Yaoqun. I was about to use a strong "wake up" method to startle Yaoqun when I saw her pull Hu Cheng over with one hand, trembling her red lips, and continuing to mumble in an almost inaudible hoarse voice:

"Comrades... prepare to act... all dispatched detachments have been ordered to return. The garrison is preparing to attack from the outside. Comrades inside, do not act upon hearing the signal... You must take advantage of the enemy's retreat and then flank them... Headquarters orders."

### Random Talk by a Lone Sojourner

— Wang Cong

Some time ago, I watched a film – "Madame Curie." I was deeply moved because I liked the way it showed ordinariness within greatness, and greatness within ordinariness.

However, I strongly disagree with the conclusion drawn by "Madame Curie" in the film. She said: "Science is the only value of mankind."

"Is science the only value of mankind?"

"Can you imagine the consequences if the atomic bomb were in the hands of fascist tyrants?"

Naturally, if Madame Curie were not a scientist, but a poet or a writer, I would not have asked her the above questions.

"A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated."

"A hero can be hated, but not despised."

Respect always occupies the top position in all kinds of love. It suppresses human history.

"Life is dear, love is more precious; for the sake of freedom, both can be thrown away."

What is freedom? Freedom is the respect for human rights. It inserts two wings of thought and action, and it can fly freely whether in the sea of suffering or at the edge of hope.

The illusion of life is not the illusion of freedom; the death of love is not the death of freedom either.

Many people who are not contemporaneous are willing to destroy their lives and take love in exchange for a second of freedom in their bodies.

— Because that is the freedom of infinite time and space in the soul.

Great humanity lies in the ability to objectively criticize oneself, in the ability to admit one's own faults and weaknesses. Because being brave in correcting one's mistakes is not shameful, but glorious.

However, it is strange that, as a certain great European philosopher said, "Although there are many mirrors in the world, people often cannot know their own appearance." Many ugly women spend most of their time primping and preening in front of the mirror. If you witness this and laugh, the ugly woman will definitely think that you are praising her beauty, and even scold you sternly: "You scoundrel! What are you laughing at? You must have bad intentions." Because if there is no most violent fermentation, it is difficult to brew a view of one's own ugliness.

### Humor from the Central Savings Society and a Suggestion

— Wu Daquan

The prize-linked savings managed by the Central Savings Society, which was quite famous before the war, now has the following prize distribution: one special prize, one first prize, one second prize, one third prize, and one fourth prize each with 416 winners, one consolation prize, and 83,349 last prizes. The prize money distribution is: a little more than 400,000 for the special prize, 2,000 yuan for the first prize, 300 yuan for the second prize, 200 yuan for the third prize, 100 yuan for the fourth prize, a little less than 2,000 yuan for the consolation prize, and 12 yuan for the last prize. The draw is held once a month. According to the above table, more than 11.5 million yuan should be awarded in prize money each month.

However, here's a "however." In the current situation, no one would be willing to go to the Central Savings Society to collect 12 yuan, which is not enough to buy half a sesame cake. The Central Savings Society can simply not pay out the prize money for these 83,349 last prizes, saving about 10 million yuan. 11.5 million yuan minus 10 million yuan, the Central Savings Society only needs to pay out 1.5 million yuan in prize money each month.

In reality, it's not even that much. The prize money for its second, third, and fourth prizes is only 300 yuan, 200 yuan, and 100 yuan. Taking these small amounts is not worth the round-trip fare. Who would be happy to go and get it? These three items amount to less than 250,000 yuan, so another 1.5 million yuan can be saved. Subtracting 250,000 yuan, the Central Savings Society only needs to pay out about 1.25 million yuan in prize money each month.

Currently, the Central Savings Society has a total of 833,499 depositors. Each depositor should deposit 12 yuan per month. Even today, the Central Savings Society has not asked to increase the amount. Depositors only need to pay the Central Savings Society 12 yuan each month. This benefit from the Central Savings Society to depositors should not be denied. However, no one in today's world does things that are detrimental to themselves. There is a small twist in how the Central Savings Society does things.

During the period of enemy occupation, the Central Savings Society was taken over by the puppet government. After the restoration, the Central Savings Society asked depositors to exchange their certificates. When exchanging certificates, it was stipulated that each depositor should pay the fees for twelve months, which should have been paid in installments over fifteen years, all at once. In other words, depositors lost the benefit of paying in installments. Relying on this gimmick, the Central Savings Society did not increase the monthly fee of 12 yuan, but benefited from collecting the fees all at once. Let's calculate it again for them:

Each depositor of the Central Savings Society should pay 12 yuan per month, 144 yuan per year, and 2,160 yuan in fifteen years. The Central Savings Society has a total of 833,499 depositors. Now, because they are paying all at once, 2,160 multiplied by 833,499, the Central Savings Society receives a total of over 1.8 billion yuan. At the current prevailing interest rate of 10% in Shanghai, the monthly interest income is over 100 million yuan. Compared with the monthly prize payment of 1.25 million yuan, the Central Savings Society's profit is unimaginable! If it included wealthy people, this could be tolerated, but unfortunately, those who are suffering from its exploitation are all our "common people."

Like my certificate, which is due in November 1960, the amount due is over 2,000 yuan. Judging from the current trend of currency inflation, I don't know if this 2,000 yuan will still be worth anything by 1960. All depositors' hopes are pinned on winning the lottery, but the Central Savings Society has four prize categories of 12 yuan, 100 yuan, 200 yuan, and 300 yuan, and the amount to be awarded accounts for more than 90% of the total amount. Isn't this deliberately making fun of the depositors? Unfortunately, we poor people really don't have such a "humorous mood."

I believe that the Central Savings Society can change the installment payment to a one-time payment due to changes in the situation, so why can't it adjust the prize amount and prize money? It would be better to reduce the number of prizes and increase the prize money. For example, the second, third, fourth, and last prizes can all be canceled and replaced with several prizes of 10,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan. If the Central Savings Society finds my suggestion to be agreeable, I will await instructions. Please don't be so "humorous" anymore.

### New Disease Name

Family Doctor: "Mr. Boerfield, I congratulate you!"

Patient: "(Excited) Am I going to recover?"

Family Doctor: "No, I don't think so, because your disease is the first time I've seen it! After you die, we're thinking of naming the disease after you!"

### Crowded

— Ziliu

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, people flocked to Shanghai. The population of Shanghai suddenly increased several times. Not only were the houses in every street and alley filled with people, but the pedestrians and vehicles on the roads were even more crowded. Everyone living in Shanghai sighed: "Shanghai is indeed too crowded!" Reading yesterday's newspaper, I learned that the Shanghai Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau had specially hired three traffic management experts from the United States, Dr. Kangwei, Dr. Haar, and Dr. Likel, to come to Shanghai to find ways to improve Shanghai's traffic and make Shanghai's roads less crowded. This is undoubtedly good news. Once the traffic is improved, it will certainly not solve the housing problem, but it will be easier for us poor friends to squeeze onto trams and buses, and we will not have to walk across intersections with such a nervous mood. But I find it strange: why is Shanghai so crowded? Shanghai wasn't so crowded before the Anti-Japanese War? After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the sacrifice of so many people, why has Shanghai's population become even more crowded?

Last night at a friend's house, I heard a nanny from northern Jiangsu lament to my friend's wife: "It's really not easy to walk in Shanghai. If you're not careful, you'll be run over by a car. If my hometown were peaceful and had a good life, I really wouldn't want to live in this hellish place in Shanghai." These few plain words suddenly made me realize why Shanghai is so crowded. Naturally, because their hometowns don't have a good life, they come to Shanghai to make a living. I don't know how many people there are whose hometowns are plagued by war, some whose hometowns are plagued by natural disasters, and some whose hometowns are made difficult to live in by evil forces. In this way, everyone comes to Shanghai with a painful hope, hoping to find a place to eat in this bustling city. As a result, Shanghai's population suddenly increased, but Shanghai's area is only so much, so how can it not be crowded?

Therefore, I believe that if the world is not peaceful and many people still cannot go home to live and work in peace, then even if American traffic experts come to Shanghai and use all their strength, I am afraid it will be difficult to solve the problem of Shanghai being too crowded.

### "Spring Dream in Paradise"

— Wen Shu

I watched the preview of "Spring Dream in Paradise" and feel that I can recommend it to the audience.

This story depicts an honest engineer who, in this unreasonable society, cannot even secure a place to live despite working diligently, while other "parasites" enjoy the fruits of his labor. In fact, if the engineer could rely on the tricks of corruption and malfeasance, why would he have to sell his own flesh and blood to pay for his wife's delivery? He could still live in high-rise buildings and travel by car. This is reality. This is a world where good souls are thrown into hell to suffer, and evil people ascend to paradise to enjoy themselves.

I admire the playwright's clear technique. At the beginning, he uses "still a power outage after the victory" to symbolize that it is still pitch black after the victory. In "Spring Dream," he gives workers low prices and reasonable compensation, creating a scene of peace and prosperity, in stark contrast to this chaotic reality. The excellent performance of the entire film is due to the director. His concise editing and thematic arrangement are ingenious everywhere. For example, using Shangguan Yunzhu's hand, from having no diamond ring to having a diamond ring, the two connected shots imply that a major event has been completed, and so on.

Lu Ming's portrayal of Mrs. Ding is natural and clear, gentle and quiet. The shortcoming is that she is not excited enough when she discovers her child, and there should be a complex process after the child is snatched away at the end.

Lan Ma's performance is quite successful, experienced and calm, but some of the characterizations are a bit overdone. Voice control still needs to be studied. There are several different timbres of voices appearing before and after. I don't know if it's a recording problem or his technical problem. Shi Yu is slightly weak, and some of the accusations in the scene are therefore weak. Wang Ping's costume is too puffy, especially in the summer and compared with the single clothes of the actors in the same scene, it is especially obvious. Her acting is seamless. Shangguan Yunzhu's role is inherently easy to please, so her performance is extremely vivid. Many other actors are also very good, achieving complete cooperation in an average and solid way.

Most of the actors come from the stage. In conclusion, they are all willing to act, but there are some common problems. Because they are accustomed to the methods of the stage, some of the delicate processes that should be there are omitted, and the movements in front of the camera are not integrated into the smooth rhythm. But they don't have the dead-eyed, water-gulping expressions of "old oil."

The photography and set design are both excellent choices. This is a work that surpasses previous films, so I boldly dare to recommend it to the audience.

### Literary and Art Circles

The ninety-second issue of the "West Wind" monthly magazine edited by Huang Jiade and Huang Jiayin was published yesterday.

The twenty-first issue of "Xinwen Tiandi" has been published. The number of pages in this issue has increased, and the content is even more substantial. The main items include "The Wishful Contention of the Diplomatic Lineup," "Long Yun Leaves Yunfu," "Hao Pengju's Defection Before and After," "Miracles in Many Plane Crashes," "Talking Outside the Plane Crash," "The Total Collapse of the Newspaper Industry," "The Gold Currency Storm," "Ma Hongda and Lei Qilin," "Shenyang in Winter," "Zhou Fohai Imprisoned on the Tiger Bridge," "British Wives Complain," "MacArthur Invites Chinese Reporters to Japan," "Opening Fire on the Central Propaganda Department," "Jiang Weiguo in Xuzhou," "News Mailbox," and other articles.

### Using Stories as Examples

— Changliu

The Taiwan Incident is burning like wildfire these past two days. I believe the wise authorities will have appropriate measures to deal with it.

Let me tell a story here first: When a certain county in Xin reported an emergency in January 1945, a certain county known for its political integrity, a most capable county magistrate, when the Japanese invaders were closest to ××, a popular armed rebellion suddenly broke out, leaving the county magistrate alone.

Later, according to a local old jurist, this proved two points to reporters: First, it indicates that politics is divorced from the people, because the support or opposition of the people always has a day to erupt. Second, the political facilities of ××× are clear, but the cadres of ×××, such as the county magistrate of a certain county, forcibly enforce the administrative orders with high-pressure means. In peacetime, the people may dare to be angry but dare not speak, but the anger of the people cannot be hidden for long.

The gray-haired old jurist made a conclusion. He said: A politician should pay attention to two points in the current democratic surge: (1) explore the hidden suffering of the people, and (2) administrative orders should be from the bottom up, so that the common people have no hidden pain.

Taiwan is a province with an education level higher than any other place in the country. The expansion of this incident is by no means accidental. I hope that the authorities can follow the will of the people, seek out the hidden suffering of the people, and use gentle policies to quickly resolve this "wildfire" that is about to spread.

The blockbuster "Rouge Tiger," which won the four-star award, is based on the novel written by the French novelist Prosper Mérimée, originally titled "Carmen," which depicts a tragic love story of a Gypsy woman. Later, it was adapted into an opera by a French musician, which was widely popular and popular in the world. Now it is brought to the screen from the opera, eliminating many of the limitations on the stage, making the performance more compact and complete, especially the actors in the series, such as Wei Wenluo Man's Carmen, whether in psychology or technology, are portrayed seamlessly. Lucien Corel's one-eyed fierceness is spicy, Malayhi's sentry also expresses the inner depression vividly, and Aitlin Yun's Murtie's guard captain all perform just right.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

Having made up his mind, "Old Zhu" strode confidently into the reception room. "Your patience is truly remarkable!"

"You're not bad either! I've come seven times, and you've dodged me seven times. Couldn't hold out any longer, eh?" Zhu Zhaonian lazily rolled over on the sofa, stood up with a playful smile.

"Alright, alright!" A look of annoyance, hatred, and fear crept over Xu Shaoming's greasy face. "Old friend, just say it plainly, how much more money do you want me to donate?"

"Donate more? When have you ever donated?" Old Zhu said with his usual playful demeanor. Standing up, he was easily more than a foot taller than the short, plump Xu Shaoming.

"I lent you trucks for your parade, and even covered most of a tank of gas. Isn't that the same as donating money?" Xu Shaoming seemed a bit angry, as he sat down on another small sofa.

"Okay, okay, Big Boss!" The other party just smiled. "With your status and wealth, aren't you ashamed to say that? Didn't you see in the newspaper: the day before yesterday, at our national flag donation parade, an old Cantonese vendor donated six thousand dollars all by himself, and a rickshaw puller donated three thousand. Old friend, your wealth is more than tens of thousands of times greater than theirs, isn't it? Just donating a few gallons of gas, does that sound reasonable? Now, we're about to send out this donation! Two million is still short by four to five hundred thousand. We're just asking you to make it complete!"

"Four to five hundred thousand? Old Zhu, you're deliberately trying to make things difficult for me, aren't you?" Xu Shaoming widened his eyes, sweat pouring from his head in anxiety.

Old Zhu burst into hearty laughter.

"What are you laughing at? Just think, four to five hundred thousand, at a time when money is so tight, aren't you trying to force me to my death?" Xu Shaoming shouted like a machine gun, "Not to mention me, Xu Shaoming, throughout all of Guilin, how many people can come up with that amount right now? Old Zhu, we're old friends, old classmates, and you've helped me in the past. Now, if you yourself were trying to escape and needed to borrow this amount from me, I, as a brother for the sake of friendship, might still be able to scrape it together somehow and help you achieve your goal. But this kind of donating money to boost troop morale is really unnecessary! Why are you trying to pressure me like this?"

"Haha! People say I, Old Zhu, am optimistic, but I didn't expect you, Old Xu, to be even more optimistic! The battles in Hubei are so critical, the enemy's offensive is so fierce, and the National Army's supplies and treatment are so meager; and you still say donating money to boost troop morale is unnecessary. Then, I have to ask you: what is necessary?" Zhu Zhaonian's tone gradually hardened, but the smile on his face did not disappear.

"Transporting materials!" Xu Shaoming replied without thinking. "Right now, the most urgent thing is naturally transporting materials! For the sake of the country, for the sake of resistance, for the sake of..." (10)
