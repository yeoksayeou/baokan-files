[Our Jinan Dispatch, 4th] The National Army's Wang Jingjiu Corps has entirely reached Tai'an and its surrounding areas. Currently, it is simultaneously commencing local pacification work and making new military deployments to conduct a planned pursuit of the Communist forces in Xintai and Laiwu. In the area east of Tai'an, the Communist forces have again gathered over 20,000 troops, seemingly with the intent to counterattack. The National Army has taken strict precautions.

[Central News Agency Kaifeng Dispatch, 4th] In the ten-day battle in northern Henan, the National Army achieved victory, attaining the originally planned strategic objectives. Yangwu, Yuanwu, Fengqiu, Yanjin, and other counties were successively recovered in a single day. Currently, the warfare in northern Henan is approaching its conclusion.

The National Army is currently clearing up the aftermath. There are no traces of Communist forces on either side of the Pinghan Railway line in the area.

### National Army Recaptures Dingbian City, Dealing a Fatal Economic Blow to the Chinese Communists; National Army in Southern Suiyuan Pursuing Towards Pianguan

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The right wing of the National Army on the eastern route in northern Shaanxi occupied Lijiacuan, southeast of Suide, on the 3rd. The left wing, bypassing the western foot of Jiuli Mountain, also approached Nangoucha. Fighting is fierce.

[Central News Agency Xi'an Dispatch, 4th] The Ningxia National Army recovered Dingbian County seat at 1:00 AM on the 4th. The Communist police regiment and units of unknown numbers were stationed inside the city. After a fierce battle, the entire police regiment was annihilated. The remaining Communists fled eastward. Pursuit is currently underway. Furthermore, the National Army captured Wayaobao at noon on the 3rd and is continuing to advance.

[Central News Agency Ningxia Dispatch, 4th] The National Army attacking Dingbian defeated the elite troops of the Communist forces at noon on the 3rd and continued to attack the city at 5:00 PM. The Communist forces stubbornly resisted. It was not until 11:00 PM that the National Army entered the city. After an hour of intense street fighting, the National Army completely recovered Dingbian County seat.

[Another Telegram] In the battle of Dingbian City, the head of the Communist police regiment, Guo Binshan, and two other officers named Rong Sheng were killed. The National Army captured over 400 Communist soldiers and seized eight mortars, over 40 light and heavy machine guns, and a radio station.

[Another Telegram] Dingbian County seat, newly recovered by the National Army, was the base for the Communist forces' harassment of the Ikh Juu League. Geographically, it is also one of the most important of the three "bians" (i.e., Dingbian, Anbian, and Jingbian). In the past, merchants gathered here, mostly those engaged in Mongolian business. Since the Communist forces occupied it, it has declined drastically. Dingbian belongs to Shaanxi Province, located on the edge of the Great Wall and bordering Yanchi County in Ningxia. The two cities are 60 li apart and are both salt-producing areas in the border region. The two counties have a total of five large salt lakes, which are extremely abundant. It is reported that four-fifths of the total expenditure of the Communist Yan'an puppet government in 1942 and 1943 relied on this abundant salt production. Therefore, the successive recovery of Yanchi and Dingbian is a fatal blow to the Communist economy.

Sun will travel to eastern Hebei and Cangxian and other places in the coming days for inspection.

However, small groups of Communist forces still appear within 30 li at night. The National Army is pursuing and suppressing them, and there are occasional minor engagements. The war spirit in the provincial capital has subsided, and grain from the countryside is being transported in continuously, and the market is gradually becoming prosperous.

### Press Delegation Arrives in Yan'an Yesterday

We arrived in Yan'an at 9:47 AM, a flight of 67 minutes. When the plane first took off, looking down from the sky, we saw the crisscrossing fields of the Guanzhong Plain stretching endlessly. After half an hour, we entered the Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi, where we saw undulating hills, intersecting gullies, terraced fields on the plains, and cave dwellings scattered irregularly along the mountains, which showed the difficult lives of the residents. Finally, when we discovered Yan'an among the mountains, we were overwhelmed with emotions. At that time, the plane slowly descended at the newly repaired airfield next to Pagoda Hill.

We then took cars through Yanchuan to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government of the Communist Party to rest, and we stayed there. This was the highest administrative organ of the Communist Party in northern Shaanxi. The houses were all cave-style mansions built of brick and stone, quite grand and impressive. All the equipment was complete and intact, which proves that the Communist army was in a hurry to retreat and did not have time to destroy it. After a short rest, we gathered in the office of the "Border Region Government" to listen to Chief of Staff Sheng report on the details of the recapture of Yan'an, which lasted an hour. After lunch, we visited the airfield and the National Army's battle achievements near Yan'an, and then visited the important organs and residences of the Communist Party.

### Breakwater in Keelung: Port Authority Is Designing Repairs

[Central News Agency Keelung Dispatch, 4th] A section of the Keelung Port breakwater, which was destroyed by bombing during the war, is 35 meters long, 14 meters wide, and 7 meters high.

This breakwater repair project is huge. In the major aspects, such as cleaning the breakwater foundation, manufacturing concrete blocks, and pouring concrete, work must be done at a depth of more than ten meters, and the degree of difficulty can be imagined. The Keelung Port Authority originally planned to start work in early March and rush to complete the repairs before the monsoon season. However, the "February 28" incident caused a delay of up to one month, and the original design had to be slightly changed. It is reported that the completed projects in the current new plan, even if they are hit by a typhoon, will not be destroyed, and the project can still continue after the typhoon.

### Ministry of Finance Planning to Solicit Business Shares for Enemy and Puppet Salt Industry Assets; Considering Levying a One-Time Property Tax

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Ministry of Finance is planning how to solicit business shares for the assets of the enemy and puppet salt industry. It is heard that a gradual promotion method will be adopted, and the government will still hold half of the shares for the sake of transition. Scattered enemy and puppet salt industry assets in Shandong, Lianghuai, and Hainan will be entirely transferred to private operation. The enemy and puppet salt industry assets in the three regions of Northeast, Changlu, and Taiwan will be assigned to the China Salt Industry Corporation. The original plan has been approved by the Executive Yuan to openly solicit shares in the form of stocks, with private shares limited to 50%. The assets in these three regions are estimated to be worth between 55 billion and 60 billion yuan. It is said that the total capital of the China Salt Industry Corporation is set at 80 billion yuan, with the government and businesses each holding half. Of the 40 billion yuan raised from business shares, 15 billion to 20 billion yuan will be deposited into the treasury, and 25 billion to 20 billion yuan will be retained as the company's working capital. Business shares will be paid in installments, and the company can be established legally when half of the shares have been paid. After the company is established, the stocks can be allowed to be auctioned on the exchange and can be mortgaged to facilitate circulation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The central government has recently been considering levying a one-time property tax in order to balance this year's budget. The plan for the levy of the one-time property tax is being drafted by the Ministry of Finance. The scope of the levy will be: (1) Urban land and rural non-cultivated land owned by the same owner exceeding 50 mu, (2) Urban houses with a current value of more than 30 million yuan per building, (3) Foreign exchange assets of Chinese citizens deposited at home and abroad, (4) Profitable business assets of more than 30 million yuan. In addition, a one-time excess property tax will be levied on individuals whose total assets currently exceed 500 million yuan and legal entities whose net assets exceed 500 million yuan. However, publicly owned property that has been verified may be exempted from the one-time property tax.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Regarding the issue of using the assets of foreign exchange deposits of Chinese citizens, it is heard that the Ministry of Finance has inquired about the opinions of the British and American governments and has been negotiating through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, recently, the Financial Counselor of the British Embassy in China, Thomas, and the American Embassy in China have replied to the Ministry of Finance, saying that they are instructed by their respective governments and are unable to assist due to legal restrictions. Therefore, the authorities are now trying to persuade Chinese citizens to voluntarily convert their foreign exchange deposits into US dollar bonds or use them to import machinery and raw materials that are currently needed in China, or to use foreign currency to deposit them in national banks. If they still fail to comply after the deadline, the government will investigate and punish them based on confidential reports.

### Uchida Takayuki's Heinous Crimes Are Obvious; War Crimes Tribunal Files Public Prosecution

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The war criminal Uchida Takayuki (commander of the Japanese 70th Division) has recently been publicly prosecuted by the prosecutors of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense. The indictment is over 4,000 words long. The following is a record of his criminal facts:

Uchida Takayuki is a native of Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. He graduated from the Japanese Army University and held various military positions, rising from infantry colonel to lieutenant general. He was a fierce and skilled Japanese general. In December 1937, he led his 16th Regiment to invade China and participate in the Battle of Taiyuan. Afterwards, he fought in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi area, such as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign in May 1942, the Guangde Campaign in September 1943, the Quzhou Campaign in June 1944, and the Lishui Campaign in August of the same year. Uchida Takayuki supervised the battles on the battlefield and personally participated in them. Wherever his troops went, they indiscriminately slaughtered people, subjected non-military personnel to torture and malicious starvation, and forced them to engage in work related to the enemy's military operations. The various atrocities are countless. For example, on January 11, 1943, the troops stationed in Fenghua fatally shot Xu Ying, a resident passing through the Wenchang Bridge, hitting a vital point. In December, the troops stationed in Wuxing successively shot 14 residents, including Huang A Yao, in Xinshi, Xilin Yan, Jintai Xiang, Yangjia Village, Baima Xiang, Yunqiao, and other places; Tan Shunpu and another person were captured and stabbed to death with bayonets on the shore of Taihu Lake, and their bodies were never found; Zhou Zifeng and other five people in Enze Xiang, Manyuan Dou, Xilin Xiang, Yigao, Mayao, Zhenze, and other places, were forced to lead the way but did not comply and were confined and starved to death; Zhu of Yunqiao in Hongcheng Xiang was driven into the river and drowned; Wu A Da was captured to the Wuzhen area and shot to death. In March and May of the same year, the troops stationed in Yuyao successively subjected Rong Siquan and Wang Wenkun, two residents, to either burning their faces with fire and stabbing their limbs with knives before throwing them into the river to their deaths, or arresting them to Henghe Street and stabbing them to death with sharp knives, abandoning their bodies for two days before they could be buried. On June 21 and July 11 and 12, the troops stationed in Xiaoshan killed residents Chen Zhang and vendors Shen Chunmu, Shen Zhangyuan, Shen A Jin, and other three people in Boshan Chen and Qian Qing in Yu Xi Xiang for no reason. On April 15, the troops stationed in Hangzhou forced Zhou A Zhen, a civilian laborer, to lead the way because of a summer sweep, but he did not comply and was dragged to Taicang Xiang and stabbed to death with a bayonet, and his body was thrown into the river; on May 1, Lang Wenhuan, a resident, was captured to Yinzi Ling in Dalu Xiang after injuring his leg, and was stabbed to death with a bayonet. He forced a traveling monk to lead the way, but he did not get his wish, so he was taken to Shishuo in Yuhang, subjected to torture, and starved to death. On August 6, Yu Yongsheng, a KMT intelligence officer, was buried alive on the Tucheng of Baoguo Temple, and resident Zhou Gengsheng was forced to pull a cart for him, but he was stabbed in the abdomen with a sharp blade because he did not understand the language, and his internal organs flowed out and he died. On May 3, 1944, the troops stationed in Zuoyi captured Shen Fuli, a civilian, from Hengjie in Wuyang Zhen, subjected him to torture, took him to Bailing Cave, and killed him with a quick knife. On June 16, Xu Xinfu, a resident, was tied up and forced to work in the Lutan official residence, and was subjected to torture and was covered in injuries. He was then abandoned in the fields. His father led him back, and he vomited blood and died. On September 24 of the same year, the troops stationed in Yongkang killed 12 residents, including Lü Congxin, in Paixi in Dachuan Xiang, Yazhuang, Yingcun, Changtian, Shaotong, and other places in Dexi Xiang because they could not escape the Japanese army's sweep. Moreover, wherever their troops went, they burned, looted, and raped women. For example, Huangdian Side on Yangming Road in Nanchang and Lingying Bridge in Baihuazhou, and the area around the county government and the Jiangdong Temple Fuzhou Gate, were burned and destroyed in 1939, reaching 1,288 buildings. The Hong family in Jinhua Xiang was looted in its entirety on December 29, 1944, suffering heavy losses. An octagonal pavilion on the Lianpodai slope under the Shangqiao Xiang Mountain in Fenghua, a historical building with hundreds of years of history, was set on fire and burned to ashes on January 19, 1943. (To be continued)

### Withdrawal of U.S. Army Personnel from the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping Complete Next Tuesday; General Gillem to Return to the U.S. on the Same Ship

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 3rd] The withdrawal of U.S. Army personnel from the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping will be completed when the transport ship General Weigel leaves China on April 9th. Only a small number of personnel will remain to handle closing tasks. A special train will depart Peiping on April 8th, carrying passengers of the General Weigel. The list of departing personnel includes officers and soldiers of the 332nd Air Transport Squadron and the 701st Military Police Battalion of the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping. With this departure, all remaining personnel of the Military Police Battalion will be completely withdrawn and relocated to their new post in Shanghai. General Gillem, commander of the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping, and his family will also leave on the General Weigel. Most passengers on the ship will return to the United States, except for one corporal, twenty-six soldiers (assigned to the U.S. Army Graves Registration Service in China), and eighty-four officers and soldiers of the 701st Military Police Battalion, who will disembark in Shanghai. The U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping will be closed at midnight on April 8th. The U.S. military warehouse in Peiping will be maintained for a considerable period under the direction of Colonel Ward, U.S. Chief of Staff of the former Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, to dispose of all remaining supplies in accordance with U.S. Army regulations. The remaining personnel will consist of twenty-five officers and twenty-three soldiers. The first group of U.S. military personnel arrived in Peiping in early January 1946 to assist in the establishment of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation. Later, due to the expansion of tasks, the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping was organized to assist in the execution of U.S. supply matters. After the United States withdrew from the Chinese mediation agency, the U.S. Military Headquarters declared its mission complete, and its closing work began on February 7, 1947, when the General Weigel first left China. The General Weigel is currently anchored outside the breakwater of Qinhuangdao Port, loading luggage and cargo, and passengers will board the ship at Tanggu.

### Zhao Jiaxiang Arrives in Shenyang

Negotiations for the Takeover of Dalian are Underway

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command, left Nanjing at 9:10 AM on the 4th aboard an air transport squadron plane to return to Shenyang. He was accompanied by Zhang Tingmeng, Commander of the First Air Force District, and several others.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] Zhao Jiaxiang returned to Shenyang by special plane at 4:00 PM on the 4th. It is said that information about Dalian must be requested before it can be released.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] According to reliable sources, the restoration of the administration of Lushun and Dalian has reached the final stage. Our side will proceed by both land and sea routes. It is reported that the Soviet side has agreed to this method. Furthermore, the central government will soon send official documents to this area regarding this matter.

[This Newspaper Report] It is learned that the difficulties in taking over Dalian, in addition to the interference from the Communist forces, include other issues that need to be resolved through diplomatic means. For example, according to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the wharves of the Free Port of Dalian are to be jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union. However, it is reported that the Soviet side intends to retain the well-equipped facilities and hand over the dilapidated and unusable ones to our country, which is one such issue. At the same time, when Japan initially surrendered, White Russians in Dalian signed contracts with Japanese residents, acquiring ownership of most of the real estate. Therefore, if our country recognizes the validity of such contracts after taking over Dalian, what we would receive would be little more than an empty city, which is another issue. It is reported that the relevant authorities are actively negotiating with the Soviet side on the above two issues.

### Soviet Union Has Not Yet Submitted a Report on the China Issue

[This Newspaper Report] Moscow, 4th (Broadcast): Regarding the China issue, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov previously urged Britain and the United States to exchange information, and it was agreed that this work would be completed by April 1st.

[This Newspaper Report] Moscow, 4th (Broadcast): Molotov issued his first statement on the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 4th, which was reviewed by Stalin beforehand. Molotov answered questions from American reporters in writing, as follows: Q: Is there a possibility of compromise between the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue of German unification? A: There is indeed such a possibility, but this issue must be decided by the German people through voting. Q: What is the total amount of reparations that the Soviet Union has already received? A: Much less than Britain and the United States. Q: What is the future of the Moscow Conference? A: The fate of this conference depends not only on the Soviet delegation but also on Britain, the United States, and France. Q: Please express your opinion on the Truman Doctrine of aid to Greece and Turkey. A: As commonly understood, I highly doubt whether this kind of aid can restore democracy in Greece. This action by the United States is, in fact, foreign interference in Greek internal affairs.

### U.S. Government Instructs MacArthur: First Phase of Japanese Reparations Goods to Begin Shipping Immediately; China Receives 15 Percent of the Total

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Disregarding the protests of other countries in the Far Eastern Commission, the United States today issued an "interim directive" to MacArthur, instructing him to immediately begin distributing Japanese war reparations materials. This directive will still be reviewed by the Far Eastern Commission, but because the United States is one of the countries with veto power, it cannot be changed unless the U.S. agrees. According to diplomatic officials, this is the first time the United States has taken such drastic action, which is beneficial to China and other countries that suffered from the war and was supported by Canada, China, the Netherlands, and the Philippines.

At today's discussion in the Far Eastern Commission, the Soviet Union, France, India, Australia, and other countries opposed it, while Britain did not participate in the debate. The State Department held a closed-door meeting today and then released the full text of a statement by McCoy, the U.S. representative to the Far Eastern Commission, making the progress clear. McCoy told the committee that on February 13, the U.S. government had submitted to the commission a plan to immediately begin distributing Japanese reparations, and the United States believed that starting to transport reparations materials was an urgent task. McCoy pointed out that the start of transporting Japanese reparations had been delayed for more than a year, and then announced the U.S. "interim directive" for MacArthur's decision.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 3rd] At a meeting of the Far Eastern Commission today, U.S. Representative General McCoy issued a statement stating: "The U.S. government has decided to issue an interim order to the occupation authorities in Japan, authorizing MacArthur to immediately transport a portion of industrial equipment to several war-torn countries for early reparations. China will receive 15 percent of the total, the Philippines 5 percent, the Netherlands 5 percent (on behalf of the Dutch East Indies), and the United Kingdom 5 percent (on behalf of Burma, Malaya, and other colonies). Under this early reparations item, the United States will receive nothing."

It is estimated that this compensation will involve 1,000 factories, which can be divided into ten major categories, the main parts of which are steel, shipbuilding, thermal power plants, machinery, aviation industry, army and navy arsenals, and some chemical industries.

[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] Regarding the immediate distribution of Japanese reparations, the "interim directive" issued by the United States to MacArthur is based on the regulations of the Far Eastern Commission, which stipulate that in the event of an emergency and the commission has not yet decided on a policy, the United States has the right to issue an interim directive and handle the matter first, and then submit it to the commission for review afterward.

### U.S. Decisive Action: To Confront the Soviet Union; Level of Contention Similar to the German Reparations Issue

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Regarding the distribution of Japanese reparations, the United States has taken action today to confront the Soviet Union. All indications are that there will be a struggle, the intensity of which will be the same as the struggle currently underway at the Moscow Conference over the issue of German reparations. Of the 1,000 Japanese factories, the United States, disregarding Soviet opposition, intends to immediately ship 300 of them to China, the Philippines, and the Eastern territories of Britain and the Netherlands to compensate for war damage. The United States gained an initial victory in the 11-nation Far Eastern Commission yesterday, decisively issuing an "interim directive" to MacArthur, instructing him to immediately begin this plan. According to official sources familiar with the situation, the Soviet Union opposed it from the initial discussion, arguing that the entire solution for Japanese reparations should be agreed upon first. The Soviet side argued that the war factories in the three eastern provinces of China, worth 2 billion U.S. dollars, should be considered when the final solution for Japanese reparations is reached, which is one of the main issues. The United States had already proposed a temporary plan for preliminary reparations on February 13, but the Far Eastern Commission did not take action on it, so the United States bypassed the Far Eastern Commission and directly instructed MacArthur, which is allowed by the commission's regulations. France and India, not being included in the temporary reparations, opposed it, while Australia insisted that all reparations should be paid only after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty. China, New Zealand, Canada, the Netherlands, and the Philippines all supported the U.S. move.

### Pingxi Shooting Range Tragedy: Police Bureau Issues Statement

Stern Negotiations with the U.S. Underway

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 4th] The Peiping Police Bureau issued a statement on the 4th stating that the main cause of the Hongshankou explosion was that U.S. soldiers failed to immediately clear unexploded shells after artillery practice at the shooting range, and that ignorant children playing with them led to the tragedy. The bureau is currently conducting stern negotiations with the U.S. based on the investigation records and expects results soon. The statement also stated that the investigation was conducted jointly by Huang, a prosecutor from the Peiping District Court, and First Lieutenant O'Dowd, a military police officer from the U.S.-China Police and Military Police Liaison Office in Peiping. The events of the incident, according to the oral statements of the injured children Shen Dazhuang, Yang Erdingzi, Song Qiyou, and other related persons Yan Zhou, Yan Dazhen, Yuan Wenxing, etc., were completely consistent. They stated that at 4:30 PM on March 31, when U.S. troops finished target practice, villager Yan Zhou and her young daughter found an unexploded shell on the west hillside. A U.S. soldier saw it and took it from them. As he walked near the artillery vehicle, he suddenly spoke in Chinese, jokingly saying to Yuan Wenxing, a child watching, "Buy me?" Yuan replied: "Broken shell casings can be sold for 100 yuan a pound, but unexploded ones are not wanted." The U.S. soldier did not answer after hearing this, and threw the shell to the west. Later, Li Xiaoliu [deceased] picked it up and took it to a place 15 meters northwest of the artillery vehicle, where he played with it with his younger brother Li Xiaomazi (deceased) and Liu Chongyuan (deceased). Unfortunately, it suddenly exploded, killing three people on the spot and injuring three others nearby, including Song Qiyou. In addition to this incident, a young child named Ma Xiaowu also died at the same location around 4:00 PM on the same day from picking up shell casings. The court has examined the body and buried it.

### Investigation of the Jiangyin Grain Embezzlement Case Completed: Former County Magistrate Fang Jiling and Others Indicted

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th] The Wu District Prosecutor's Office has completed its investigation of the major embezzlement case in the Jiangyin County Grain Bureau. Fang Jiling, former county magistrate, Xu Jiechang, secretary of the Grain Bureau, Zeng Chiping, director of the Qingyang Office, Xu Zukun, deputy director, Zhu Hongji, weigher, Qian Xiaojiang, Xi Junru, and Xu Jingru, all accomplices in violating Article 3, Paragraph 6, Article 3, Paragraph 7, and Article 13 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, were indicted on the 4th. As for the involvement of Wu Liang, deputy director of the Grain Bureau, Zhang Jianqiu, inspector, Chen Kejiong, warehouse manager, and Bian Yinjie, merchant, the District Prosecutor's Office found that Wu Liang had long been at odds with Fang Jiling and had secretly reported the case to the provincial office before it was exposed, indicating that he was not an accomplice. Zhang Jianqiu and others were also found to be unrelated, so they were all dismissed from prosecution. The facts of Fang and others' crimes are briefly recorded below: During the grain collection in Cheng County, Xu Jiechang relied on the county magistrate's favor and colluded with Zeng Te and other influential local figures to form the Xinyi Rice Firm, which specialized in collecting cash from grain households and using the firm's receipts as proof of payment of taxes, and then going to the warehouses to settle the exchange procedures. On the one hand, Xu Jingru was instructed to purchase rice in Wuxi with the cash collected and hand it over to the warehouse, ostensibly for the convenience of the people, but in reality, the market price was raised, and various exorbitant expenses such as transportation fees and handling fees were collected, with officials and merchants colluding to exploit the people for their own benefit. As many as 21 branches were set up, and Fang Jiling's protection and profit-sharing were clearly visible. After the case was exposed, it was transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial High Court and then referred to the Wu District Prosecutor's Office for investigation as above.

Editorial

### The Pan-Asian Conference Concludes

The inaugural Pan-Asian Conference concluded on the 2nd. Mahatma Gandhi of India delivered a speech at the closing session, stating that Asia would conquer the world with its love, non-violence, and true blessings; the Western nations would have to acknowledge this. He added that the Western nations are currently busy manufacturing atomic bombs, which will destroy the world; it is Asia's mission to liberate the world from this threat. Jawaharlal Nehru, Deputy Prime Minister of the Interim Government of India, also delivered a speech, asserting that Europe's domination of the world is a thing of the past. The world has followed Europe for too long, and now that Europe is divided by countless conflicts, the world is turning to Asia and America. The Asian nations must all be nation-states, but they must also have a common plan for future action. Nehru further stated that the next Pan-Asian Conference will be held in China in 1949. Thus, the inaugural Pan-Asian Conference, which had captured the world's attention, came to an end.

Since its opening in New Delhi on March 23rd, the Pan-Asian Conference has lasted for ten days. During this period, representatives from thirty-two nations gathered to discuss various issues in groups, achieving some agreements. In addition to reaffirming vague principles of international relations, the conference decided to establish a permanent organization named the Asian Relations Association, and to form a provisional council comprised of thirty representatives from various Asian nations. This is a concrete manifestation of the increasing solidarity among Asian nations. For the arrival of this Asian century, we, the people of the Far East, naturally express our sincere congratulations and joy. As the Pan-Asian Conference concludes, we would like to offer our thoughts.

In this day of the arrival of the Asian century, the need for Asian unity is self-evident. However, Asia is merely a geographical name, a part of the world's landmass. Due to its vast expanse and long history, the people of Asia, although living on the same continent, not only differ in race but also in culture. The participation of Egyptian representatives in this Pan-Asian Conference shows that the term "Asia" and "Pan-Asia" are rather ambiguous. The historical process of Europe differs from that of Asia. Due to the Roman Empire and the prevalence of Christianity, the European nations, despite their multitude, are a unit in terms of culture and history. The history of Asia is not so. In culture, America is an extension of Europe, and with Spain's exploration of North and South America, the independent countries of the Americas, although numerous, are interconnected and belong to the same family. Therefore, the Pan-American movement and the Pan-European movement have their historical factors at play. The historical development of Asian nations differs from the processes of Europe and America. Although figures such as Genghis Khan and Timur created certain unified situations, they did not leave a lasting mark on the entire history of Asia. Asian nations do not have the same historical background; therefore, the development of the Pan-Asian movement is more difficult than the Pan-European and Pan-American movements. In the past, Japanese militarists wanted to use "Hakkō ichiu" as a slogan to launch the so-called Greater East Asia movement. This was an aggressive movement centered on Japanese militarists, and its failure was expected.

It is precisely because Asian nations lack a common historical background that we express our immense joy at the success of this Pan-Asian Conference. It is almost unimaginable that various Asian nations, with vast differences in history, culture, and even language and race, could gather to convene the so-called Pan-Asian Conference. Yet, this inaugural Pan-Asian Conference has actually been convened, and it has been successful. This is, on the one hand, due to the appeal of the personal reputations of figures such as Gandhi and Nehru, and, on the other hand, it also reflects the awareness of Asian nations to strengthen unity. Today, Asia is situated between two major camps, and the political, economic, and social development of Asian nations still remains in a relatively backward stage. As humanity has entered the atomic age, the lives of Asian nations have not changed much from their past glorious historical periods. Mahatma Gandhi's spinning wheel and his goat – when we think of them appearing in an era when humanity has entered the atomic age, it truly evokes many feelings. It is precisely because of the backwardness in various aspects that Asian nations need close unity today. This is why we see the success of convening the Pan-Asian Conference.

However, the sustainability of a movement cannot rely solely on a shared psychological demand; it must have a living spiritual source to solidify this shared psychological demand. Asian nations do not have common factors in race, thought, or culture. To ensure the lasting success of this movement, it is necessary to find a common spiritual source. Marxism-Leninism must be said to be a living spiritual factor, and a common spiritual factor in the Western world must be the tradition of Christianity. Now, as the Pan-Asian movement unfolds, we carefully assess the current situation and deeply feel that only the Three Principles of the People can be the living spiritual source for this movement. The moderation and peace of the Three Principles of the People coincide with the goals of the movement advocated by Gandhi and Nehru in India. It should be the guiding principle for the Pan-Asian movement. As the Pan-Asian Conference concludes, we would like to offer this point for consideration.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Still Shows Little Progress; Reparations Issue at an Impasse, Difficult to Break; Debate on German Electoral System Arouses Heated Discussion

[This Newspaper News] Moscow Broadcast on the 4th Regarding the German reparations issue, since Marshall put forward a compromise proposal, all parties have been paying attention to Molotov. Although Marshall's proposal has the possibility of breaking the deadlock, it is still far from the Soviet side's demands. According to Marshall's proposal, how much reparations the Soviet side can obtain is currently unknown. According to the latest news, Molotov has absolutely no intention of compromising.

[United Press Moscow 4th] The Adjustment Committee of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, in order to prepare the work completed by the four foreign ministers so far, today's meeting was almost entirely dominated by the committee. In order to allow the committee more time to work, the four foreign ministers decided to delay the meeting time by two hours than usual, that is, to meet at 6 p.m. instead of 4 p.m. At tonight's meeting, the four foreign ministers pointed out that they hope to resolve the two most serious issues in the German peace treaty, namely the future borders of Germany and the issue of reparations demands.

[Agence France-Presse Moscow 3rd] Regarding the German electoral system, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference today, advocating the adoption of a proportional representation system, but was opposed by British Foreign Secretary Bevin, thus arousing heated debate. Foreign Secretary Bevin said: The proportional representation system is actually an old-fashioned social democratic system. I am opposed to any system that is sufficient to create a one-party dictatorship. Foreign Minister Molotov immediately replied: I admit that the proportional representation system is an old-fashioned democratic system, but we should at least refuse to defend the dictatorship and anti-democratic system currently practiced in Greece. Foreign Secretary Bevin retorted: The proportional representation system you proposed has already been implemented in Greece. Foreign Minister Molotov retorted: This is enough to prove that after a perfect system falls into the hands of excessively experienced people, it can produce other results. Personally, I would rather adopt the proportional representation system practiced in France than the proportional representation system practiced in Greece. The four foreign ministers then discussed the report submitted by a small subcommittee (responsible for reviewing the work of the Adjustment Committee) for a long time, and no agreement was reached on all political issues. Only in principle did they pass the proposal of French Foreign Minister Bidault to eliminate Germany's war potential. However, the four foreign ministers did not reach an agreement on the various dates proposed by Bidault.

[This Newspaper News] Moscow Broadcast on the 4th: Molotov told American reporters today that the Soviet Union's proposal on German unification and the American advocacy of Germany adopting a federal system have great possibilities for compromise, but the issue of adopting a federal system should be decided by the German people through a referendum.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Aid to Greece and Turkey Act; Acheson Answers Questions from Senators

[United Press Washington 3rd] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed President Truman's proposed bill to aid Greece and Turkey today, but Chairman Vandenberg proposed a surprising amendment, arguing that if the Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly opposes it, the plan can be cancelled at any time by a majority vote. The State Department also supports this, in order to show goodwill to the United Nations and those who criticize Congress, because they all condemn this move as overstepping the authority of the world organization. It is said that the United States will not veto the United Nations' order to withdraw from Greece and Turkey, but if the United Nations does not find a remedy, it cannot stop its aid plan.

[United Press Washington 3rd] After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act, the committee members successively raised questions, asking, "Is the government considering taking the same measures for Greece to aid the Chinese government in resisting the CCP army?" Acting Secretary of State Acheson replied that the situation in Greece is very different from that in China, so the government does not intend to take the same action for the two countries, but the United States has already provided a large financial loan to the Chinese government and has already armed thirty-nine divisions of the Chinese army with weapons. Asked whether "the United States is drafting general principles as the basis for its policies around the world, especially for China, Poland, Finland, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Inner Mongolia, etc.", Acheson replied that when foreign governments request aid, we will consider each situation separately, and the measures to be taken will naturally be similar to those for Greece and Turkey.

### US State Department Explains True Meaning of Aid to Greece and Turkey

[Agence France-Presse Washington 3rd] The US State Department today issued a 46-page document, answering 111 questions raised by senators regarding the US aid plan to Greece and Turkey, stating that the US aid plan to Greece and Turkey should not be seen as an "encirclement" of the Soviet Union or any other country. There is no doubt that the armed bandits led by the Communist Party in Greece are being encouraged by foreign countries. The Soviet government should not regard the US aid to Greece and Turkey as an action that requires the Soviet Union to take retaliatory measures. The State Department's views on this issue are as follows: (1) The United States intends to transport a "limited" amount of surplus military supplies to Iran; (2) The United States does not want to use aid to Greece and Turkey as a means to become a "joint guard" of the Dardanelles Strait, because the United States does not have any special responsibility for the Dardanelles Strait; (3) The US plan should not be seen as an "encirclement" of the Soviet Union or any other country; (4) The bandits led and armed by the Communist Party are the main threat to Greek independence.

### Truman Answers Questions from Reporters, Explaining Various Domestic and Foreign Issues

[Agence France-Presse Washington 3rd] President Truman recently held a weekly press conference to answer various questions and issued statements as follows: (1) I completely trust Secretary of the Interior Krug and have no intention of asking him to resign. Krug will respond to Lewis within days; (2) Regarding the telephone workers' strike, I have ordered the Department of Labor to study the matter. If the workers strike, the government will requisition the telephone company; (3) Whether Secretary of State Marshall will return to the United States soon, I am unable to express an opinion here; (4) I have no emergency plan in mind regarding aid to Greece and Turkey; (5) The Chicago mayoral election candidate Kay is a Democrat; (6) The recent order I issued to civil servants in various government agencies is to obtain the loyalty of civil servants to the government, and it is not fear that the Communist Party will overthrow the US government. This statement is absurd.

[Agence France-Presse Washington 3rd] Regarding the issue of the United States banning the Communist Party, it is reported that after careful study, President Truman agreed with Hoover's argument that Congress should not take any measures to make the Communist Party an illegal political party, because the Communist Party has no chance of success in elections or direct action, and banning the Communist Party now would pose a major crisis to American democracy and freedom.

### The Gallery Was Extremely Crowded; Lights Were On in Every Home When the Court Adjourned; Lin, Yang, and Zhan Were Separately Summoned to Court; Initial Public Hearing of the Jin Chao Case; Detailed Account of the Secret Letter Process; All Matters Regarding the Five Trusting Businesses Were Determined by the Central Bank

[Our Newspaper's Report] The court held the first trial yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM for the case of officials and merchants colluding to manipulate gold prices. The defendants were Lin Fengbao, former director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank; Yang Anren, deputy director; and Zhan Yesheng, chairman of the Gold Businesses Association. The witnesses summoned were Feng Qing'an (manager of Yang Qinghe Fa Ji Gold Shop), Zhang Baiyuan (manager of Dafeng Heng Gold Shop), Ni Zuguang (manager of Fang Jiuxia Chang Ji Gold Shop), Xie Bingquan (manager of Dakang Yuan Gold Shop), Wang Liyuan (employee of Tong Fengyu Gold Shop), Wang Songtao (assistant manager and chief of the Cashier Section of the Central Bank's Business Bureau), and Ying Minghe (manager of Tong Fengyu Gold Shop). All but Ying Minghe, who received the summons too late to arrive, appeared in court. After six hours of separate questioning by Judge Jia Zhuo, the court announced that the trial would be adjourned and rescheduled. Defendants Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren remained on bail from the Central Bank, while Zhan Liansheng was returned to custody. By the time of adjournment, lights were on in every home.

The Second Criminal Court of the District Court added court police yesterday to guard the "Jin Chao Case" trial, the gallery was full, and latecomers were denied entry. Lawyer seats and reporter seats were also crowded. After the court inquired about the ages and hometowns of the three defendants Lin, Yang, and Zhan, the clerk read aloud the recorded statements of the four witnesses, Feng Qing'an, Zhang Baiyuan, Ni Zuguang, and Xie Bingquan, who were summoned on the 28th of last month. After reading, Chen Tingshuo, the lawyer defending Zhan, claimed that the witness's statement that Zhan Liansheng participated in the Central Bank's decision on gold prices was inconsistent with the facts and requested a detailed inquiry of the three defendants. Ni Fengguang, the manager of Fang Jiuxia, also requested a correction, stating that Zhan did not participate in deciding the price and that everything was determined by the Central Bank itself. The court rebuked: "You will be held criminally liable for perjury. It has been explained last time. Why are you recanting today?" Then began individual questioning.

Lin Fengbao

Testified that the organization of the Central Bank's Business Bureau consisted of one director, six deputy directors, and more than ten assistant managers. The director, deputy directors, and heads of various sections were responsible for their respective levels of business. The Central Bank's gold sales policy was based on the resolution passed by the National Defense Supreme Council on February 25 of last year, which opened up free trading of foreign exchange and gold, and Article 29 of the Foreign Exchange Opening Plan authorized the Central Bank to freely trade based on market conditions. Bei Zuyi, the former president of the Central Bank, personally decided on the explicit and secret distribution, targeting gold shops and silver shops. Starting from March 8 of last year, he personally oversaw the initial ten days or so, with Bei personally presiding over both explicit and secret gold price distribution, which was then handed over to the Business Bureau.

Explicit and Secret Distribution Initially Effective

The explicit distribution price was determined daily at 10:00 AM with reference to market conditions. Although the gold market started trading at 9:00 AM, gold was inseparable from foreign exchange, and foreign exchange rates were not available until 10:00 AM, so the gold price was also determined at 10:00 AM every morning. Secret sales began on March 9 of last year. There was only one explicit distribution per day because the Central Bank aimed to suppress gold prices. If the gold market rose sharply in the middle of the day, it would be sold through designated businesses in a secret manner so that the market would not know that it was sold by the Central Bank. The price was the highest price at that time to increase national treasury revenue. At the same time, increasing chips and increasing supply could achieve the effect of suppressing prices. The court questioned: Since the Central Bank was always committed to suppressing gold prices, why did the gold price still rise every day? Lin replied: "In the months of March, April, May, June, and July last year, the Central Bank's gold policy was quite successful. During this period, the gold price remained around 2 million. On August 19, the National Government adjusted the foreign exchange rate, and the gold price once skyrocketed. The Central Bank immediately made every effort to suppress it, and it stabilized again in two days. After October, profiteers speculated on gold, and the Central Bank's sales could not be controlled. Therefore, at the beginning of February, the highest authorities decided to stop the distribution."

Central Bank Determines the Five Trusting Businesses

As for Zhan Liansheng, they were not previously acquainted. When it was decided to distribute gold, President Bei summoned Xu Bosheng, the former chairman of the Gold Industry Association, to the bank and introduced them. Zhan came as the chairman of the Gold Businesses Association and brought a list of more than 60 gold businesses, from which five with good reputations were selected and designated to purchase. For explicit gold distribution, the Central Bank supplied it without limitation, without the need to apply. Tong Fengyu, Taikang Run, Fang Jiuxia, Yang Qinghe, and Dafeng Heng were also directly designated by the Central Bank without going through application procedures. The Central Bank also did not use application forms for gold distribution. Moreover, because the Central Bank entrusted Tong Fengyu to handle the work of converting gold blocks into ten-tael gold bars, gold distribution was sometimes directly received from Tong Fengyu for convenience. For gold distribution transactions completed in the morning, settlement was done on the same day, and transactions completed in the afternoon were settled the next day, and no arrears were allowed. The court questioned the discrepancies between the Central Bank's accounts and the accounts of the gold shops and silver shops. Lin stated that the Central Bank's accounts must be balanced with the amount of cash every day, so there were no errors.

Yang Anren

Testified that as the deputy director of the Central Bank, he was in charge of the gold and silver section. The distribution of gold was a national government policy, and the Central Bank's Business Bureau only followed it. Explicit distribution was supplied by the Central Bank without limitation, and there were no mandatory regulations for secret sales. Application forms were a procedure between gold shops, silver shop members, and the association, and had nothing to do with the Central Bank. The Central Bank's pricing for explicit distribution was very open, so complicated procedures were not used. Zhan Liansheng was an old acquaintance because he was the chairman of the Gold Brokers Association before the war and had dealings with the Central Bank, so he was familiar with him. For secret gold sales, five businesses were designated and divided into two groups. Taikang Run was independent, and Zhan Liansheng's seal was not required for guarantee when taking gold. When Fang Jiuxia, Tong Fengyu, Dafeng Heng, and Yang Qinghe took gold, Zhan's seal was required for guarantee if funds were insufficient.

Zhan Liansheng

Testified that Tong Fengyu was a partnership organization, divided into fifteen shares, and Central Bank employees did not have shares. He did not previously know Lin Fengbao, but had known Yang Anren for more than ten years. The gold distribution price, whether explicit or secret, was determined by the Central Bank itself, and he could not participate. For explicit distribution, the gold shops and silver shops would first determine the number of bars, and then the Central Bank would offer a price. If it was too expensive, the number of bars could be reduced, but not increased. Secret sales were not fixed in time or quantity. Bank drafts were often used for settlement in the morning, and a small amount of cash was used in the afternoon. The court presented the customer accounts of Tong Fengyu, with the names "Zhongzhi," "Zhongyi," and "Central Friend" recorded. What was the explanation? Zhan replied: "Zhongzhi" was used when lower-level employees of the Central Bank purchased gold, "Zhongyi" was the account name for the Central Bank's doormen, workers, and old clerks to buy and sell gold, and "Central Friend" was probably friends of Central Bank employees. Wang Songtao, the assistant manager and cashier director of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, once purchased more than a hundred gold bars from Tong Fengyu. As for the detailed situation on the accounts, it would be known by questioning Ying Minghe.

After the three defendants were questioned, the court questioned each witness one by one. Wang Songtao denied purchasing gold, saying that he only introduced relatives and friends. Wang Liyuan also denied that senior Central Bank officials had entrusted her to purchase gold bars. The statements of the other witnesses were generally similar to before.

The whole venue was filled with a naive and lively atmosphere, and the sound of the scout music alternated. The rostrum was full of great figures who had lost their youth, all of whom, as elders, gave fairy tales one after another.

The mayor said in his speech: "I hope that everyone in the world will maintain the innocent and unadorned heart of a child, because this is the vitality of the nation."

Kong Xiangxi said: "The rise and fall of a country lies in the people, and the rise and fall of a family lies in the children. So we must pay attention to children. 'Generals and ministers are not born with noble lineage; men should be self-reliant.' As long as we are self-reliant, everyone can become a great man."

Wang Xiaolai said: "We must pay attention to the beggar children on the street. This is the shame of the country. Charity organizations should take on the mission."

Gu Jieling from a district in Pengpu celebrated Children's Day. A commemorative meeting was held in the public stadium yesterday morning, with more than 5,000 students from 23 schools attending. An amusement fair was held at Shangwen Elementary School in the afternoon.

Chen Kuitang, a blind child representing all blind children from the blind school, gave a speech. He said painfully: "Today I want to file a complaint to the society. The reason why we became blind is not our fault, but the unsoundness of the social medical institutions. Otherwise, at least 80% or more can be guaranteed not to become disabled." He made two demands to the society: (1) Strengthen medical institutions. (2) Provide as much assistance as possible to the unfortunate blind people.

Speaker Pan was slightly late to the meeting due to other official duties. He gave a brief speech, roughly saying: "China is now moving towards the avenue of democratic politics. The future is bright and optimistic. Children are closely related to the national fortune. I firmly believe that the future of children will be bright and promising."

Finally, children's representatives Huang Junjie, Dai Ying, Wu Jiezong, and others gave thank-you speeches separately. Then Mayor Wu began to award prizes for the health competition. The strong spotlights on the stage lit up, and the baby suddenly cried. Mayor Wu heard the sound and showed a smile on his face.

Finally, there were performances by Pan Yuzhen, the national music of Wei Shenle, and the screening of movies by the American News Office, which did not end until about 12:00 PM.

In addition, the Shanghai Refugee and Orphan Reception Center in Caohejing was recently sponsored by Guan Sheng Yuan Food Company General Manager Xi Guansheng. Yesterday morning, the refugee children representatives presented a banner to express their gratitude.

### During the Enemy and Puppet Period, A Bully in Hongkou Claimed to Be Familiar with "Head" and Was Forced to Be District Chief

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Jifa, who once served as the district chief of the Third District of the Enemy Navy Baojia, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. Because Wu had lived in Hongkou for many years, he was a well-known bully in Hongkou during the enemy and puppet period. The gallery was extremely crowded with those who came to listen. Wu was fat-headed and big-eared, wearing a gray cloth gown and yellow leather shoes. He answered the questions of Judge Liu in a confident manner.

It was found that Wu Jifa, 43 years old, from Danyang, lived at No. 773 Tangshan Road and ran a noodle restaurant. During the period when the enemy army occupied Shanghai, the area north of the Suzhou River was designated as the enemy navy garrison area. A Baojia headquarters was established at No. 25 Pingliang Road, and Qi Shouyu was sent in charge. The area between Dalianwan Road, Zhaofeng Road, Zhujia Lane, and the Huangpu River was designated as the Third District. From November of the 30th year, Wu was sent as the district chief of the district and concurrently served as the leader of the pseudo-Youth League in the district. He acted arbitrarily and harmed merchants and people. He once collected copper from the people, levied Baojia donations and aircraft donations, forced participation in self-defense team sentry duty, and air defense training, and blocked traffic at any time to search pedestrians. He also opened Wu Fang Hotel. A traveler Wang Yanhua, Luo Jiayu, sold 800 sacks. The hotel accountant Dai Yi planned to buy 200 forcibly but failed. He reported to the enemy army and pointed out that the sacks were military supplies, and all were confiscated. After the victory, victims Yu Senkang, Wang Yanhua, Feng Ermao, and others filed a complaint. The High Procuratorate prosecuted Wu on suspicion of being a traitor due to his serious crimes.

When Wu defended yesterday, he admitted that he had served as the district chief of the Third District of the Enemy Navy Baojia and concurrently as the leader of the pseudo-Youth League. However, he said: "Because Qi Shouyu often came to my store to eat noodles, seeing that I was very familiar with the people in the area, he said: 'Little guy, come out and do things. You have to do it, unless you move your store to Chongqing.' Later, the Japanese came to oppress me again, and there was no way to come out and be the district chief." As for the continuous questions about the collection of copper, the collection of Baojia donations, and the aircraft donations, he said that he did not know and shirked responsibility to the Baojia headquarters. He coughed dryly to cover up his embarrassment. As for the self-defense team sentry duty, he said that it was to prevent petty thieves from stealing things. As for the blockade, he said that he did not have this power. Regarding the confiscation of the 800 sacks of travelers Wang Yanhua and Luo Jiayu in Wu Fang Hotel, he said: "The rooms in Wu Fang Hotel are very small and cannot hold 800 sacks at all."

After summoning Wang Yanhua, Feng Ermao, and the mother of Chen Koudi, another victim, and questioning them, it was announced that the case still needed to be investigated, and the defendants were sent back to prison.

### Two Foremen in the Same Case as Zhou Liesheng Are Retried; The Court Summons the Wives of the Two Accused; Each Is Given A Proclamation: "Eliminate Extortion and Bribery"

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ren Tianfu and Que Chuyang, the foremen of Rihuigang, who are in the same case as Zhou Gengsheng, who is currently starving to death in the High Court detention center, were accused of being suspected of being traitors and were retried in the High Court yesterday.

Judge Liu announced that the case still needed to be investigated and summoned the wives of the two defendants Ren and Que to the front of the case, each giving them a small proclamation of "Eliminate Extortion and Bribery" and said: "If anyone comes to your house to extort money, do not be deceived.

### Another Small Loan Organization

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the Relief Society's establishment of small business loans, another organization, the Intermediate Credit Trust Company, together with Jincheng, Dalu, Siming, China Industrial and Mining, Women's Commerce, and other banks, a total of ten units, have jointly established a Joint Credit Small Loan Office, with a fund of 300,000 yuan. The loan recipients are limited to public school teachers and commercial and industrial employees, with an interest rate of five percent and a term of three months. The loan amount each time is from 300,000 to 1,000,000 yuan, managed by Mr. Mao Xiaocen. According to Mr. Mao, with 300,000 yuan, assuming each person borrows 800,000 yuan at a time, only about 400 people can be loaned to, and it is estimated that it will be exhausted in less than a month. This meager amount is hardly enough to speak of as a welfare service for society, but it is hoped that all sectors of the city's banking and finance community can continue to respond and organize separately. If the city's more than 200 banks can each contribute 30 million yuan as a welfare loan fund, the total amount will exceed 7,000,000 yuan. If used well, the beneficiaries will be extremely widespread. Furthermore, this loan is expected to be implemented in mid-month. One million yuan can be loaned each time, at an interest rate of five percent.

### The Significance of the Normal Education Movement Week

— Gu Yuxiu

Teach tirelessly, learn without end, teaching and learning complement each other, knowledge and benevolence are upheld. Be strict like a father, kind like a mother, strictness and kindness complement each other, rites are established and music is achieved.

Today is Normal Education Movement Week, and I plan to briefly describe the significance of Normal Education Movement Week.

First, I will explain the meaning of the two words "Normal Education." The so-called "teacher" is a teacher, and "normal" means a model. Normal schools already existed in considerable numbers when the new school system in China began. Its purpose is to teach people how to be teachers, so it is a place to cultivate teachers. Our promotion of the Normal Education Movement is to illustrate that today's teachers are not sufficient in number for distribution. Because universities believe that university professors have other methods for teaching, only teachers in primary and secondary schools and kindergartens must have specialized schools to engage in professional training.

I remember that at the commemorative meeting for this Normal Education Movement Week, Mr. Chen Heqin used machines to compare children, saying: If a machine is damaged, not just anyone can repair it. As for a child, their psychological development is far more complex than a machine, and it is not something that just anyone can teach unless they have methods, passion, and knowledge. We must first learn how to be a teacher before we can be a good teacher.

In recent years, due to the increase in schools and the advancement of knowledge, there has been a great lack of teachers. Therefore, we have established many normal schools and used public funds to encourage normal school students, allowing them to study for free in school and serve the education field for a long time after leaving school. However, because few students enroll, the problem of teacher shortage remains unresolved. Therefore, promoting Normal Education Movement Week can, on the one hand, provide students with a training opportunity; on the other hand, Normal Education Movement Week requires students to take an oath in front of everyone, allowing them to understand that being a teacher requires a spirit of continuous service. At the same time, during the Anti-Japanese War, we also take this opportunity to express our welcome to the teachers who had to leave the teaching profession due to the pressure of life but returned to the education field after the victory. In this way, the answer to the problem of teacher shortage can be helped a little.

The Normal Education Movement has been going on for five years, and this is the sixth Normal Education Movement Week. When it was held for the first time, I was serving in the Ministry of Education. Minister Chen and I discussed a couplet, which I will now tell you about. I had forgotten this couplet at first, but I remembered it again a few days ago thanks to the reminder from President Zhang of Fudan University.

The first sentence of the first line of this couplet is "Teach tirelessly," which means teaching others without ever feeling tired. The second is "Learn without end," because learning is endless and must continue to be pursued. This is not only for teachers but also for everyone. "Teaching and learning complement each other." Teachers self-study and learn, which can enrich their knowledge, but the progress made through teaching is also very significant. When we are in school, we always think that we are proficient in various subjects. Once we leave school to teach others, we realize that we cannot teach anything. We only know our shortcomings after teaching, so we must prepare. Many university professors become experts because of teaching students. Primary, secondary, and kindergarten teachers are in constant contact with lively children, so there will definitely be great progress, so it is said that teaching and learning mutually inspire and enhance each other. The next sentence is "Knowledge and benevolence are upheld," which means that after knowledge is gained, benevolence and universal love are used to continue to maintain it for a long time. The words above combined are "Teach tirelessly, learn without end, teaching and learning complement each other, knowledge and benevolence are upheld." This line is aimed at the teacher's pursuit of learning.

The second line is also for teachers. What is said is the teacher's attitude and the function and purpose of education. A teacher should be "strict like a father," as strict as a father, and "kind like a mother," as kind as a mother. Teachers are like parents. Parents are the people that children love the most and are also the most popular among children. As the saying goes, "Do not mislead children," which shows how important the teacher's position is. But if teachers are only kind like a mother, they will inevitably be too lenient. If they are only strict like a father, they will inevitably be too severe. Lenience can easily make children indulge, and severity can easily make children suffer. Therefore, teachers must "complement strictness and kindness," without neglecting either. In the past, teachers often regarded themselves as strict teachers, but the new education does not. It requires understanding children's psychology, influencing children's behavior, and combining strictness and kindness. This seems difficult to do, but to be successful in education, it must be done. The last sentence is "Rites are established and music is achieved." The ancients said, "Establish rites and make music upon success." Rites are mainly solemn, like a father, and music is mainly kind and harmonious, like a mother. If there are only rites, then it is rigid and a terrible shackle; if there is only music, then it is easy to be soft and scattered. Therefore, Confucius created rites and music to be used together, one is indispensable. The basic purpose of the six arts of education is to build a nation, and the key to the success of nation-building depends on the completion of education. This line combined is "Be strict like a father, kind like a mother, strictness and kindness complement each other, rites are established and music is achieved."

In summary, the significance of the Normal Education Movement is, on the one hand, to awaken society to respect teachers, and on the other hand, to encourage teachers to rise up and complete their great tasks. I hope that everyone will widely promote the Normal Education Movement. Whether they are teachers, parents, or people from all walks of life, everyone should participate in this Normal Education Movement Week, work together, and achieve education first and successful nation-building!

### Breast Cancer in Women

— Zhang Zanchen

Breast cancer is the most dangerous disease among women's breast ailments. It is not common in the strong and healthy, but it is easier to suffer from in the weak and elderly. Its origin is very distant. It first starts as a hard lump in the breast. Sometimes there is a twitching pain in the breast, which is the initial sign. If treatment is started at this time, it can often be cured. If the opportunity is missed and delayed, it becomes as large as a fist or a bowl, the body is as hard as stone, or it even ulcerates, revealing countless wounds, like a cancerous rock. Even with a good doctor, it is not easy to start.

Chinese doctors have their own reasons for the causes of breast cancer. Chen Yuangong said it is caused by a large deficiency of qi and blood. Chen Shigong said it is caused by melancholy damaging the liver, contemplation damaging the spleen, and accumulated thoughts in the heart, with unfulfilled wishes, leading to meridian obstruction and gathering into a lump. This is similar to the foreign scholars' theory that the nervous system is related to the limitation and occurrence of various tumors.

Wang Sheng's Surgical Principles says: "Breast cancer can be treated in women under 40, but not in those over 50. Treating it will lead to death, but not treating it will allow them to live out their natural lifespan."

Han Qing said: "Whether a woman is married or unmarried, they can all develop this condition. It is caused by the extreme yin and declining yang, where deficient yang accumulates with blood, and the blood permeates the heart meridian. If it has not broken, it can be treated; if it has broken, it is difficult to treat."

Hu Gongbi said: "Breast cancer is caused by women's suspicious nature, or dissatisfaction with their mother-in-law, or dissatisfaction with their husband and children. Failing to take care of themselves, resentment brews, and depression accumulates, leading to the qi of the jueyin meridian not flowing, and the blood of the yangming meridian boiling. The breast orifices are blocked, forming a hard lump, shaped like a chess piece. It may not develop for five or seven years, or even more than ten years. Later, due to the prevailing age or a sudden anger, it erupts and rots, opening like a flipped pomegranate flower. It can be treated in those under 30 years old with strong qi and blood, but it is difficult to treat in those over 40 years old with declining qi and blood."

Combining the above statements, the prognosis of breast cancer can be generally imagined.

It is an extremely regrettable disease for women to suffer from breast cancer. It is an extremely unpleasant thing for doctors to treat breast cancer. To restore health, patients with breast cancer must have the following basic principles: First, there must be sufficient family financial resources to supply the use of medicine. Second, the mind must be peaceful and listen to the doctor's guidance. Third, maintain excellent nutrition.

Surgical removal of breast cancer can be performed if the area and lump are not widespread.

Drug treatment of breast cancer, based on many years of experience, feels that for early-stage symptoms, about ten to twenty doses of Yang He Tang or Xiao Jin Dan can generally eliminate it. Chen Yuangong's Hua Yan Dan and Xian Qingyu's Xiao Ruyan Wan can all be considered for reference.

For mild and early-stage cancer, simple formulas such as crucian carp paste and crab shell powder are very commonly used.

### Painful Menstruation

— Zhu Diran

Menstruation is a special physiological function in women, originally a preparation for life and death. The regularity and abnormalities of menstruation are closely related to women's health and have an impact on fertility.

Among the many types of menstrual disorders in women, the most common is dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation). Dysmenorrhea is even more prevalent among women in Shanghai than among those in inland areas.

There are many causes of dysmenorrhea, including physiological deformities, latent venereal diseases, excessive sexual desire, physical stimulation, and especially restrictive clothing, which can often lead to the symptoms of dysmenorrhea.

The symptoms of dysmenorrhea are that women experience abdominal distension and pain, breast hardening and distension, limb fatigue, and decreased appetite before their period. During menstruation, there may be abdominal distension and pain, and the menstrual blood may sometimes clot.

The occurrence of dysmenorrhea is sometimes accidental and can resolve itself without treatment, but chronic cases tend to worsen over time.

If dysmenorrhea is not treated, it often turns into conditions such as dry blood and uterine cancer in middle age.

I have summarized the treatment methods for dysmenorrhea into the following:

(1) Soothing the Liver: For menstrual pain caused by emotional depression, Chinese medicine uses the method of soothing the liver, which involves using Xiaoyao San (Free and Easy Wanderer Powder) with modifications. This can both regulate liver qi and promote blood circulation, which is a very reliable method.

(2) Nourishing the Blood: When blood is depleted and the blood vessels cannot flow smoothly, simply nourishing the blood sufficiently will strengthen circulation, and pathological conditions such as pain will subside.

(3) Removing Blood Stasis: For dysmenorrhea caused by blood clots blocking blood vessels, simply removing the blood clots will allow the menstrual flow to become smooth, and the pain will naturally disappear.

(4) Warming the Meridians: If the uterus is cold and the blood cannot circulate, using herbs such as cinnamon and Evodia rutaecarpa can provide a radical cure.

(5) Cooling the Blood: If there is heat in the blood sea (a concept in traditional Chinese medicine), causing pain, it is likely that the endometrium, the uterine substance, and the fallopian tubes are inflamed. The only treatment is to use blood-cooling herbs such as Moutan bark and rehmannia root.

(6) Relieving Worries: This method is a type of psychological therapy. A friend's wife used to suffer from severe dysmenorrhea, and many doctors were ineffective. I told her some stories, which helped her forget her pain.

### Two Pharmaceutical Matters

— Cen Zhiliang

Improving Pharmaceutical Manufacturing: Traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are closely related. The effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine is undeniable. However, the manufacturing methods never improve, preventing it from stepping one foot out of the country. In the future, scientific methods should be adopted to improve it, so that it is more convenient for doctors to apply clinically, and the effectiveness will naturally be doubled.

Cultivating Medicinal Materials: The so-called authentic medicinal materials in China are all natural products. However, some medicinal materials are in high demand but low in production, resulting in high prices and affecting business. Therefore, some people use imported products. To remedy this drawback, it is necessary to have abundant production, and to achieve abundant production, artificial cultivation must be promoted.

A Thought

### The Medicinal Value of "Amaranth"

— Gong Peiying

Especially Rich in Vitamin C

We were initially surprised to see in the Compendium of Materia Medica that amaranth can be used to treat diseases, because it is just a common vegetable and doesn't seem to have any special properties. Therefore, we looked down on it!

However, recent research has revealed that it has many benefits. Han Baosheng once said: "There are six types of amaranth: red amaranth, white amaranth, man amaranth, purple amaranth, five-colored amaranth, and horse amaranth. Man amaranth and white amaranth can be used for medicinal purposes. Red amaranth has a pungent taste and other uses." Su Song said: "Man amaranth and white amaranth are cold in nature, also known as sugar amaranth, Hu amaranth, and fine amaranth. In fact, they are the same. The larger one is called white amaranth, and the smaller one is called man amaranth. White amaranth replenishes qi, clears heat, and opens the nine orifices. Red amaranth treats red dysentery. Purple amaranth kills insect poisons and treats qi dysentery. Man amaranth can benefit the large and small intestines and treat all types of dysentery and induce abortion." Scientists now report that both white amaranth and red amaranth contain calcium, and red amaranth contains even more iron. Ordinary white amaranth sold in the market contains 1.09 mg of Vitamin C per cubic centimeter. Red amaranth contains only 0.25 mg per cubic centimeter. This shows that the content of Vitamin C is five times higher in white amaranth.

It has also been determined that the function of Vitamin C contained in amaranth is the same as that of American oranges and can also treat scurvy. In other words, eating this regularly can prevent the invasion of scurvy.

Now there are many children with scurvy, so choose this amaranth, which contains valuable ingredients, as a non-medicinal treatment.

Everywhere

### Trachoma

— Ye Jinqiu

A few years ago, a medical journal asked me to write some articles on single prescriptions. I wrote a short story about Hu Die and Mei Lanfang before they went abroad and gave it to him. The general idea was:

Western countries pay close attention to trachoma. Even the slightest problem must be strictly prevented. Those who travel to those countries from China are inspected particularly closely because Chinese people pay too little attention to it. Before Hu Die, Mei Lanfang, and their entourage went abroad that time, thirteen followers all had some eye problems, so they were greatly hampered, and seeking treatment was not easy to cure quickly. Just as they were at a loss, Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, came up with a secret recipe. The recipe was carp bile juice, mixed with oriental cinnabar and applied to the affected area, and they were immediately cured. The secret recipe was truly unexpected.

Since its publication, it has attracted the attention of many people. Mr. Zheng Jian-san was the first to write to the Municipal National Medical Association to inquire about the pharmacology. Mr. Xi Jie, a reporter from Jingbao, also indirectly inquired about Dr. Mei. The reply was:

I was asked to inquire about the treatment of trachoma. Last night, Wan Hua (Dr. Mei's name) invited me to dinner, and I asked him about it at the banquet. According to him, many people in the troupe suffered from trachoma before going to the United States. Someone came up with a prescription: grind green fish bile and yellow cinnabar (this is a medicinal product, available in all pharmacies) into a powder, mix it with water, and drop a little into the eyes. The patients treated themselves according to this method, and after examination, they all passed. However, I don't know for sure whether this prescription is effective for trachoma, but I do know that some members of the troupe did use it at the time. — See Jingbao, August 4, 1936

Then (August 8), Jingbao published an article by Bao Jun-cheng:

My little boy is twelve years old this year and is suffering from trachoma. He has been treated by doctors, but with little effect. I couldn't help but be overjoyed when I read the newspaper. As the saying goes, "A single prescription of medicine can infuriate a famous doctor." I immediately went to the pharmacy, bought green fish bile and yellow cinnabar, and treated him according to the method. Unexpectedly, as soon as the medicine entered his eyes, the little boy screamed in pain, and the red veins in his eyes suddenly appeared. I don't know much about medicine. Is this a phenomenon that occurs at the beginning of treatment, and will it be effective later? I also don't know if the members of Mr. Mei's troupe had this phenomenon when they were treated.

It is recorded that the prescription comes from the Sheng Hui Fang written by Chen Shiliang of the Southern Tang Dynasty. The prescription uses half an ounce of lead cinnabar, mixed with carp bile juice into a paste, and applied two or three times a day, specifically to treat eyes with pearl tubes. Oriental cinnabar is lead cinnabar, also known as yellow cinnabar, cinnabar powder, and vermilion powder, all made from lead. It is found that trachoma has different types: granular, papillary, cicatricial, and mixed. Lead quality is also harmful to the limited, but ancient prescriptions for eye medicine often use it, or perhaps the ancient and modern refining are different. In addition, most eye medicines are water-flying, that is, as fine as possible, and sudden pain in the eyes is probably related to the thickness.

(Note by Cunren: This prescription has been submitted to ophthalmologists Lu Nanzhi and Li Qizhi for research. Seeking several trachoma patients for free treatment, you can write to No. 1 Weihaiwei Road for reply.)

### Questions about Using Tamarix chinensis for Measles

— You Xuezhou

It is well known that Tamarix chinensis is used to treat measles, and it is also a single prescription commonly used by the people to treat measles. According to the custom in my hometown of Wuxi, when children first show signs of measles, they immediately seek out Tamarix chinensis to decoct and drink, saying that it has the property of promoting eruption and can speed up the eruption of measles to avoid unexpected changes. However, according to the custom in Yin County, Tamarix chinensis is only taken when the measles recedes. Therefore, when I first came to Shanghai and used Tamarix chinensis to treat measles, I would ask people from Yin County whether Tamarix chinensis could be taken. Strangely, I asked the reason, and then I realized that "different places have different methods, and different temples have different Bodhisattvas." Since then, I have had doubts about the use of Tamarix chinensis to treat measles: when measles first appear, the focus is on eruption, and the medicine must use those that are volatile and contain a little stimulating, that is, the old method calls it "hot in nature"; when measles recede, the focus is on detoxification, and the medicine must use those that reduce inflammation and fever or have a yin-nourishing effect, that is, the old method calls it "cold in nature." What is the nature and taste of Tamarix chinensis? What kind of effect does it have on measles? This is something that must be considered.

The symptoms of the same disease often differ between urban and rural areas. Taking measles as an example, children in rural areas often have red faces, coarse breath, a great thirst for drinking, constipation, and a thick yellow tongue coating or a green dry tongue. The treatment methods are nothing more than two: one is to relieve both the exterior and interior at the same time, to erupt the measles while inducing the bowel movement, although the functions are opposite, the effects can be complementary. The other is to use the "black and blue soup" method, which not only relieves the exterior, but also nourishes the yin to save its depleted body fluids and increase its resistance. Because the internal heat is strong, herbs that are cold in nature are not only not forbidden, but even used quickly, such as the "Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang" prescription, which is not abandoned because it contains gypsum, and is even regarded as an emergency prescription when measles change adversely. As for the urban area—especially Shanghai—children with measles, although they have a high fever, often have pale faces and rarely see a red and dry tongue. Therefore, usually only the method of opening the lungs and relieving the exterior is used to help its outward expansion. From this, I realized that the treatment of measles with Tamarix chinensis is not to promote eruption, but to take its Qing Jie (clear and resolve toxicity). In my hometown of Xixi, it is used when the initial signs of spots appear, which is designed for those with fever and heat on the face, which is different from the Yin people's use when it recedes. Although the time is different, the effects are actually the same.

Since then, I have used Tamarix chinensis in my prescriptions for those who have just shown signs of measles with fever, thirst, irritability, and coarse breath, and I do not use it if there is no such phenomenon. The purpose is not to erupt the skin rash, but to clear away the heat. Fortunately, there have been no accidents for more than ten years. However, what is the actual function of Tamarix chinensis? Is my personal opinion reliable? It is still a doubt, and I hope that my colleagues who have true knowledge and insight will come forward to teach me.

### The National Bank Designates 23 Cities to Solicit and Sell US Dollar Bonds; Shanghai Banking and Financial Industries Pledge to Subscribe to US$40 Million

[Reported by this newspaper] Starting today, short-term US dollar treasury bills and US dollar bonds for 1947 will be pre-sold by the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank and 81 entrusted banks and firms in Shanghai. To date, the Shanghai Banking and Financial Industries Association has subscribed to US$30 million in short-term treasury bills, equivalent to CN¥360 billion, and US$10 million in US dollar bonds, equivalent to CN¥120 billion. This already accounts for one-fifth of the first phase issuance of these bonds, totaling US$200 million. The Nanjing Banking and Financial Industries Association has also pledged to subscribe to CN¥10 billion in bonds. The Nanjing China Cement Company has also subscribed to CN¥100 million. As for issuance matters in various regions, the National Bank has also telegraphed to its branches in Nanjing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Xi'an, Hankou, Kunming, Beiping, Qingdao, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Bengbu, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Lanzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and 23 other cities to immediately form solicitation and sales committees and entrust qualified banks and firms in various regions to act as agents for sales.

### Public Meeting of the Shanghai Solicitation Committee; Qian Xinzhi Elected Chairman

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Solicitation Committee for the 1947 Short-Term Treasury Bills and US Dollar Bonds held its inaugural meeting at 4 p.m. yesterday in the conference room on the third floor of the National Bank. All 17 members attended, and the meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m. Qian Xinzhi was elected chairman, and Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiqing were elected vice chairmen. Lun was hired as the secretary-general of the committee, and Fan Heyan was the deputy secretary-general. After the meeting, Chairman Qian Xinzhi gave a speech to the press, stating that US dollar treasury bills and bonds are the first bonds issued after the victory. The purpose is to stabilize the current economic situation, as wartime finance relied heavily on the issuance of currency, resulting in currency inflation, soaring prices, and huge expenditures, affecting the general public. Now, in order to stabilize prices, reduce the issuance of currency, and absorb idle funds in the market at the same time, everyone needs to actively subscribe to bonds. This is beneficial to both the country and the people. According to this issuance, US dollar treasury bills and bonds are guaranteed by foreign exchange funds and solid assets. In addition, the Fund Management Committee needs to report the amount of fund receipts and payments every six months. Moreover, these bonds can be freely bought and sold for mortgage purposes, can be used as a guarantee reserve for the financial industry, and can also be used to pay the National Bank's deposit reserve, so the conditions are very superior. Currently, the Shanghai Banking and Financial Industries Association, including the Three Banks and Two Bureaus, has already subscribed to a total of US$40 million of these bonds. The pre-subscription vouchers for these bonds have been distributed to the entrusted banks and firms, and it is hoped that all sectors will actively subscribe to them.

### Director of the Public Debt Department Chen Bingzhang Discusses Fully Utilizing Public Debt Policies

Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, answered several questions at the request of reporters from various newspapers. The main points are as follows: (1) The method for identifying the fineness of gold will be determined after consultation between the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank. (2) The handling fee for each entrusted bank and firm for distribution has been determined to be one-thousandth of the bond issuance amount. The distribution method will be determined by the National Bank. (3) The bond proceeds collected by each bank and firm will be settled every ten days as stipulated. (4) The Fund Management Committee may be established in Shanghai next Tuesday, and Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance may personally attend the meeting at that time. (5) The US dollar bond fund has been instructed by the Ministry of Finance to the National Bank to allocate a certain amount of foreign exchange funds as collateral. Short-term treasury bills are secured by state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet assets. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Resources Committee, and the Enemy and Puppet Assets Handling Committee will negotiate and formulate methods, submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then submit them to the National Government for promulgation. (6) These bonds are intended to fully utilize public debt policies in principle and should be freely circulated. However, the time when they can be listed for trading still needs to wait until the formal bonds are printed before they can be put into use. (7) In principle, after any country issues public bonds, the price circulating in the market is always lower than the face value. Therefore, even if the market price of US dollar bonds is lower than the face value after issuance, this is not surprising, and it does not mean that the credit of the bonds is weak.

### Rice Market Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, a total of more than 9,400 dan (a unit of dry measure) of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The merchants' appetite for purchases strengthened, and production areas frequently increased prices, which were affected accordingly. Japonica and indica rice both continued to rise by CN¥2,000 to CN¥3,000. Flour also rose by more than CN¥1,000 due to high prices in the interior, poor transportation, and lively digestion. Foreign flour increased by another CN¥2,000. Bran sales in the surrounding countryside were active, increasing by about CN¥2,000. Soybean cake also rose with the increase in various items, increasing by CN¥1,300 to CN¥1,500 per step.

The oil market merchants' appetite was very refreshing, and it regained its vigor. Raw oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, and refined oil all rose uniformly by nearly CN¥10,000. Soybean oil factories had a rather greedy appetite for imports, and demand still exceeded supply, gradually rising. Soybeans and Chinese goods both increased by CN¥1,000 to CN¥2,000, and mung beans were also in short supply. Mung beans temporarily lacked glory, and cowpeas from Shantou became sluggish and fell back by CN¥1,000 to CN¥2,000.

Corn had little arrival and sales, and the price was stable. Red sorghum still had a good market for the mill, and the price increased by CN¥1,000. Sesame and foreign sesame were both crushed and increased by CN¥2,000 to CN¥3,000. Peanut kernels had a dull appetite in both foreign ports and local streets, and they were tired in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, with no significant fluctuations. Red beans were dull and stable, priced at CN¥1,000.

### Bulls Take Profits, Foreign Stocks Fall After Being Strong

Trading in foreign stocks was slightly sluggish yesterday. People in the securities business intended to buy more shares, but many profit-taking bulls appeared, lacking support, and they fell after being strong. Ewo Silk opened at CN¥31,300, reached a high of CN¥31,700, and then was sold off sharply. The afternoon closed fell back to a low of CN¥29,100. After noon, it stabilized slightly. Apart from Ewo Silk being slightly active, He shares all lingered at low levels. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the industry generally fell back by slightly less than 10%, and the others fell by slightly more than 5%.

### Chinese Stocks Tend to Consolidate, Mei Ya's Rise Is Particularly Strong

Yesterday, Mei Ya's rise in Chinese stocks was still strong. The bulls were still waiting for an opportunity to increase their holdings in Yong Silk. Although it rose, it struggled more and was far less than Mei Ya. There were more transactions, and most of the major players in the industry were still waiting and watching. The trend was mostly consolidation, with each rising by half a percent, and the rest were flat or slightly rising.

It opened high in the morning, and then formed a consolidation pattern. Nos. 207, 97, 198, and 76 were in supply, and Nos. 94, 117, and 69 were purchased, and then struggled. Later, Nos. 145, 198, 31, 231, 169, and 219 were sold to CN¥2,425. Mei Ya was keenly bought by Nos. 223 and 117 and was quickly profitable. Nos. 97, 235, 160, 76, 2, 223, 24, 180, 198, 231, 102, and 4 all purchased, and then gradually raised to CN¥2,570. Nos. 95, 97, 219, 207, 198, 154, and 197 sold off, reducing to CN¥2,530. The buying appetite of Nos. 4, 18, 223, 142, and 160 was strong, and Yong Silk saw a high price of CN¥2,600. Nos. 65, 145, 76, 183, 226, and 142 took the opportunity to close out, falling back to CN¥2,500. Nos. 117 and 185 both increased their absorption, and the closing price was pulled up to CN¥2,540. After closing, the price was called up to CN¥2,570. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Shui Silk and China France rose by slightly less than half a percent, and Xinyi, China Feng, and Xinguang Xin Hua Zheng rose. Mei Ya rose by slightly less than 10%. For delivery, Mei Ya rose by slightly less than 10%, Yong Silk and Xinyi each rose by slightly less than half a percent, Hua Feng and Xinguang slightly rose, and Tong Yi Business Firecrackers

In the afternoon, Nos. 213 and 145 both entered, and Delivery Yong Silk rose to CN¥2,570. Nos. 215, 185, 153, and 68 closed out at high prices and once fell back to within CN¥2,540. Mei Ya's upward trend was still strong, and it was soon raised by No. 223 to the limit. Nos. 22, 20, 35, 71, and 169 all entered, and Lian An rose to the limit. Delivery Yong Silk then rose to CN¥2,610. Nos. 198, 84, and 106 sold off at high prices, falling back to CN¥2,570.

There were a total of 1,647 applicants, including 1,282 manufacturers and 265 yarn numbers.

### Assisting Tea Merchants in Exporting; Permission to Increase Pledge Funds

[Reported by this newspaper] It has been learned that the largest principle for loans for tea exports in 1947 is to grant loans based on the value of raw tea for refined manufacturing, and then make export remittances based on the value of boxed tea. After arriving at the export location, pledge loans can be made. When exporting, packing loans are made based on letters of credit. All of these are to prevent non-tea merchants from applying for loans. The first stage of the loan requires raw tea to be eligible for application. The maximum loan limit is CN¥600,000 for Qihong, CN¥500,000 for Tunlv, and CN¥400,000 for Pingsi. As for the export tea of 1946, after the National Treasury could no longer bear the profits and losses of the purchase, the Ministry of Economic Affairs also sent a letter to the National Bank one day, stating that the purchase of export tea was not a matter of competing with the people for profits, so the original purchase plan was finally withdrawn. The National Bank sent a letter to the Executive Yuan on the third day to report the withdrawal of the original purchase plan, and also sent letters to the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and tea merchants for reference. However, in order to assist tea merchants in exporting, they are allowed to apply for additional loans from the China Farmers Bank. The limit is calculated based on the estimated pledge limit for export tea in 1947. The total amount of pledge funds is about CN¥20 billion or more. However, the original pledge funds must be deducted. The original pledge funds were CN¥350,000 for Qihong, CN¥280,000 for Tunlv, and CN¥200,000 for Pinglv, totaling more than CN¥14 billion. Now, Qihong has increased to CN¥480,000, Tunlv to CN¥400,000, and Pinglv to CN¥320,000, an increase of more than CN¥7 billion.

### International Monetary Fund Has Two Functions, US Government Supports It with All Its Strength

[Our Newspaper Report] Gu Shuiqun, the representative of our group to the International Monetary Fund, returned to Shanghai from the United States on the 3rd. When meeting with reporters, he stated that representatives from various countries are now returning to their respective countries to report their duties to their governments. In addition to reporting to the government this time, he also has important matters to discuss. However, Mr. Gu did not frequently disclose what the matters were, nor the nature and content of the discussions. He only said that he would stay in the country for about three or four weeks, and return to the United States after finishing his work.

Mr. Gu stated: The Monetary Fund officially started working in March, but its current approach is very cautious, so it is "not very lively". So far, the funds recognized by various countries have been paid successively, and exchange rates have also been mostly submitted. Those that have not yet been submitted, including our country, should not be delayed for too long. In terms of the contribution of the fund, it can be viewed from two aspects: The first function is that when countries have short-term imbalances in their foreign income and expenditure, the fund can help them; however, no country with any ability of its own would borrow from the fund, but would rather seek to balance itself with its own strength. Therefore, the role of the fund is no less than a "second reserve". The second function of the fund is more active, and it is especially meaningful at present. That is, representatives from various countries can meet at any time to exchange opinions and study various financial and fiscal issues of various countries, thereby enhancing understanding and sympathy. This method can solve some problems and increase the light of international economic cooperation.

Reporters asked: Since the death of President Roosevelt, the initiator of the fund, does the US government have sufficient enthusiasm for supporting the implementation of the monetary fund? Mr. Gu said: The US government not only has enthusiasm, but also has concrete measures. A National Advisory Council has now been established, with the heads of the Ministry of Finance, the State Department, the Ministry of Commerce, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the Export-Import Bank serving as members. The direct guidance given to the US personnel working in the fund shows the degree of importance attached to it. As for the attitude of the Soviet Union, it was inconsistent before and after. It participated in the meeting when the fund was established, but later its attitude became indifferent. It has not paid the fund and does not participate in the meeting. However, Mr. Gu believes that this is a temporary phenomenon.

Mr. Gu believes that if the situation in our country becomes stable, the fund will be of great help to us. There is a good phenomenon at present, that is, the representatives of various countries in the fund deeply sympathize with our country's efforts to overcome economic difficulties. Regarding our country's future currency, Mr. Gu has two points of view: He believes that our country should participate in international cooperation, but at the same time, it must have a definite monetary policy. He also said that the future of the International Bank is very bright, and many large plans are being drafted. However, he avoided talking about the US$500 million loan, believing that it is not within his scope of duties.

Spring and Autumn

### In Memory of Jiang Chun on the 20th Anniversary of His Death

— Hu Shanyuan

Jiang Chun passed away on April 3rd of the sixteenth year [of the Republic], and today marks exactly twenty years. I can no longer avoid writing a few words to commemorate him.

Jiang Chun was my classmate, friend, and confidant. If the definition of "lover" isn't limited to the opposite sex, he was also my lover. In short, he was the closest person to me besides my own flesh and blood! I loved literature, and so did he. Together, we founded the "Mi Xiao Society". I loved traveling, and so did he. Although some of the things he loved, such as playing the violin, weren't always things I loved, it seemed that he was interested in everything I loved. For example, his interest in watching soccer wasn't as great as mine, but I often dragged him and his wife along. …

Whenever I faced difficulties, he would resolve them and make arrangements for me before I even had to say anything. Most simply, when I didn't have money to send home, he wouldn't wait for me to ask or pretend that he didn't know. At most, I would mention it to him, and he would definitely lend me money. Once he lent it, he would never ask me to repay it, and he wouldn't refuse when I returned it to him. He was truly someone I could rely on in times of need!

More importantly, he gave me countless comforts in my spirit. Two or three decades ago, I was someone who often complained, and it seemed that almost everything I encountered went against my wishes. It wasn't that my fate was bad, but rather that my temperament couldn't conform to the mundane world. Moreover, facing financial difficulties, I couldn't help but have to interact with people, even to the point of pleading and entrusting them. He exhausted his verbal explanations and practical assistance to stabilize me and encourage me to strive forward. When I spoke to others, my words might be ignored or even ridiculed and opposed. But when I spoke to him, it seemed that he always valued and agreed with me. Of course, many people disagreed with my actions, but in his eyes, they always seemed right. He always expressed his approval to my face, and always said I was right behind my back. In a word, emotionally, he had unconditional harmony with me!

Guan Zhong said, "My parents gave me life, Bao Shu knows me." I can't help but say, "My parents gave me life, Jiang Chun knows me." Unfortunately, he passed away twenty years ago at the age of twenty-odd, a promising age, due to typhoid fever!

However, after his death, I never wrote anything to commemorate him. At his memorial service, I didn't send a single couplet or banner. I never directly mentioned him in any other publications either. It's not that I couldn't write, but rather that I didn't want to write.

The reason I didn't want to write, of course, wasn't that I didn't want to write at all, but rather that "there was something to wait for". What was I waiting for? I was waiting for the ability to write freely and thoroughly, and for the ability to publish it and spread it far and wide immediately after writing it. I didn't want to write anything perfunctory. But that wait lasted twenty years!

In those twenty years, I was trapped and haggard in the struggle for survival for the first ten years. The last ten years, from the War of Resistance to the present, what kind of era is it? Everyone knows. Of course, I was still struggling. I couldn't write, and even if I wrote, I couldn't publish it. I could only wait, waiting for an opportunity, waiting for a miracle to appear, so that I could fulfill my long-cherished wish.

Has the opportunity come now? No! Has the miracle appeared? Even less so! But I feel that I can't wait any longer: the world is like this, "Waiting for the Yellow River to clear, who knows when that day will come!" And as for myself, looking in the mirror, my white hair is about to fill my forehead. I am old and decrepit, what am I still waiting for!

I have already written freely and thoroughly, and have already written four-fifths, or sixty to seventy thousand words, of what I planned to write. I hope to finish it this year. After finishing it, of course, there is no guarantee of a chance to publish it, and it is even more uncertain whether it can be passed down for a long time. But I think: as long as I write it well, everything else is no problem. Miracles will not appear (for example, none of Jiang Chun's other friends, or anyone else, will help me with this matter), but there will always be opportunities. If I can't publish it during my lifetime, perhaps my descendants will publish it for me. At the very least, my descendants will always keep the manuscripts I have written to commemorate Jiang Chun. Although not distant, it is long enough.

I won't wait any longer. On the 20th anniversary of his death, I want to write this short article to commemorate him first. In reality, he died too lonely. In these twenty years, I have not seen or heard anyone, including his family, express any commemoration of him. Of course, this short article of mine doesn't have much power, just as my million-word long novel may not have any power either, but at least I have done my best for him.

In these twenty years, I have commemorated him every moment. From now on, I will still commemorate him every moment! This is my true commemoration of him, not just on this one day of the 20th anniversary of his death!

Jiang Chun's surname was Qian, his given name was Rongsun, he was from Songjiang, a Bachelor of Laws from Soochow University, and he worked as a translator at the Commercial Press for many years. He founded Songjiang Junior High School and was one of the responsible persons of Songjiang Shanghai Jingxian Girls' High School. His writings are scattered in various publications, and I will collect them for him and publish a complete collection.

His relationship with society and the country should be written by someone else. If not, I will write it for him separately. I won't elaborate on it here.

### Oleander

— Luo Ming

When I came to this house, I had a good impression of the three oleander trees that shaded the front yard. Later, I placed my desk by a window, and right outside this window was an oleander tree. Every day when I was free, I would lean against the window and watch it sway in a gentle breeze, or drop one or two crimson petals.

Friends who came to visit me also admired it, saying that the environment was good. The good environment was due to the oleander screen in front and the vegetable garden in the back.

However, I didn't have a good impression of the vegetable garden. I liked these three oleander trees. They grew so tall, taller than the surrounding wall. They were so lush and evergreen. They stood tall and vigorous, blooming beautiful peach-like flowers on their branches. However, they were not gentle or charming, nor did they spread fragrance to please people. They grew lonely in this garden.

Every day, I was delighted by the vigorous growth of the tender buds. When I was leisurely pacing in the garden, I often stroked the green leaves. I liked this shady color, which seemed to symbolize a life developing in hardship.

During cold, rainy evenings, I often felt deeply lonely. A dim yellow lamp accompanied me, the filament emitting a faint light and radiating a faint heat. I quietly recorded the day's life, or opened a book and crawled through the pages with my dull eyes. The sound of rain constantly interrupted my thoughts, and the depressing atmosphere suffocated and irritated me. So I opened the blinds, and a gust of cold wind blew in, waking me up from my desolation. Looking out, I could vaguely make out an oleander branch in the garden swaying painfully. Raindrops struck the leaves, sobbing and telling their story. As if enlightened, I began to understand that life grows in loneliness and in wind and rain. Therefore, I calmed down again, restrained my emotions, gently closed the window, and prepared to rest, as well as to prepare a portion of the enthusiasm needed for tomorrow's life.

Before long, autumn ended and winter arrived, and the oleander began to decline, with leaves falling one by one, falling very sparsely. However, it was still so verdant, the buds on the branches tightly wrapped, seemingly preparing to fight against the cold winter. I was not saddened by the falling of the old leaves, because the buds had not died, and the death of the old was just the beginning of the new growth.

It was another harsh day, with frost and snow flying, and thick snow piled up in the garden. Letting my frozen body bake by the stove, counting the years, I thought of my grandfather's white beard and my mother's coughing nights. I buried myself in chaotic and bitter memories. Raising my head, I saw the oleander standing in front of the window, burdened with snowflakes, heavily bent over. It was still so stubborn, neither withering its leaves nor breaking its waist, silently enduring the attacks of winter.

I felt ashamed, I felt that I was so weak and pathetic, not even having the courage of a living thing. I was incompetent, I was unable to stand in the blizzard, although I had faith in spring, but the days of winter were so unbearable.

In this room with a stove, I finally made it through this winter. Now, early spring has returned, and the oleander standing by the window is laughing and talking in the spring breeze, the seedlings have been opened by the spring wind and sprouted, and the green leaves are gradually adding new green young leaves.

I keep my faith, this will no longer be a flowerless spring. The oleander, this organism that symbolizes strong life, will bloom those lovely flowers that symbolize youth.

One warm spring morning, I broke off a branch of the oleander and inserted it on the table. I felt like I had received a dose of encouragement.

### Cold Food Festival and Qingming Festival

— Lao Dan

The Cold Food Festival, according to general legend, is associated with the story of Jie Zitui burning himself to death. However, according to the Zuo Zhuan and the Records of the Grand Historian, there was no such thing as Jie Zitui being burned to death. However, the Rites of Zhou says: "Now the Cold Food Festival follows the solar terms, which is the end of mid-spring, and Qingming is the beginning of the third month. However, burning fire is an old system of the Zhou Dynasty, and is not due to Jie Zitui." At the same time, the Rites of Zhou also has a slightly vague record, saying: "The Siju official in mid-spring uses a wooden clapper to repair fire prohibitions in the country, for the spring season when fire will be released." Because the fire ban is cold fire. The Cold Food Festival originated in ancient times, which is one explanation.

As for Jie Zitui embracing a tree and burning to death, Duke Wen of Jin mourned him: he issued an order throughout the country that no fire should be lit on the fifth day of May to mourn him. This is what is said in the Qin Cao. Whether Jie Zitui and Jie Zisui are the same person, and whether the fifth day of May is the day before the current Qingming Festival, remains to be verified.

The Chronicle of Seasonal Customs in Jingchu records: "One hundred and five days after the Winter Solstice, there is a strong wind, which is called the Cold Food Festival." In this way, according to the calendar calculation, it is two days before Qingming. However, Shen Quanqi's Cold Food Festival poem says: "Meeting the Cold Food Festival outside the mountains, spring comes but there is no sunshine. In Luoyang, the new Jiazi year, tomorrow is Qingming." Then, the Cold Food Festival is one hundred and six days after the Winter Solstice. There are also different theories about the duration of the fire ban. Emperor Wu of Wei's decree on punishment says: "One hundred and five days after the Winter Solstice, all fires must be extinguished for the Cold Food Festival." The Book of Later Han says: "Zhou Ju was transferred to the position of Inspector of Bingzhou... In mid-spring, the Cold Food Festival lasts for a month, which is unbearable for the old and the young." Lin Zhong Ji says: "To cut off fire for Jie Zitui, cold food for three days." Cutting off fire for one hundred and five days, considering the inconvenience of eating, is inhumane, especially in the cold regions of the north. It is said that one hundred and five days after the Winter Solstice refers to only one day, the 150th day after the Winter Solstice, and not one hundred and fifty days of extinguishing fire and eating cold food. Fortunately, this is a historical term in folk legends, and only old-style poets use it as material for chanting, and its actual life has long been cut off.

The Qingming Festival has a long history. The most popular poem is Du Mu's Qingming poem: "During the Qingming Festival, it rains incessantly, and the travelers on the road are heartbroken! May I ask where there is a tavern, and the shepherd boy points to Xinghua Village." Ouyang Xiu's Butterfly Loves Flowers lyrics: "Rain accumulates and wind rages at the end of the third month, the door closes at dusk; there is no way to keep spring. Tearful eyes ask the flowers, but the flowers do not speak, and the messy red flies over the swing." What a sad and moving verse, making people feel the scene of the Cold Food and Qingming Festivals.

Sweeping tombs during the Qingming Festival is a custom of the last few hundred years, and not a ritual that has existed since ancient times. For example, when Cai Yong saw Emperor Ling visiting the mausoleum, he was awe-struck and said to others: "Although tomb worship is not found in ancient times, it may as well be created." Later, Emperor Wen of Wei and Emperor Xuan of Jin, Peng Jingzhi, a Doctor of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices in the Tang Dynasty, and Tang Shaodu advocated that "tomb worship is not allowed by the three rites, and should be prohibited." The two took extreme positions. But now, sweeping tombs and worshiping tombs has become a common thing. Every spring and autumn festival, people go to sweep tombs in various places and visit the tombs of relatives and friends to express their remembrance, which is still a more normal ritual.

Ji Tang chants. Liangfen's poems have a sequel to the Tang Collection.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 308

— Ye Jingfeng

"Of course it's tense..." Tsurumi cut off Zheng Yan's words, "Everyone is preparing to get promoted and make a fortune, and if they don't take the opportunity to make their instruments sound louder, they're afraid they won't be able to perform on stage..." Tsurumi sneered, "Taking the lives of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or hundreds of millions of people to exchange for their fame, this deal is very cost-effective!" Tsurumi expressed his deep regret, pondered for a while, and then asked Zheng Yan, "Tokyo, Shenyang, do we have our own news?"

"Yes; '〇十二' and '〇二' are paying special attention to the development of the situation; Hasegawa's news was sent by '〇十二'. In Shenyang, what is worth noting is the advance of the army to Shanxi; '〇二' said that the captain has a plan to transplant the trunk line..."

"Yes, pre-decoration and relocation of a part of Peiping, there are several new experts, and a large group of people is being organized; the strength is very strong and the supply is considered sufficient. Oh..." Tsurumi seemed to remember something, his sword-like eyebrows furrowed together, and at the same time he looked at his watch, "Huh... where did she go?"

Zheng Yan didn't know who Tsurumi was asking about, so he didn't dare to answer. Tsurumi jumped up from his seat and handed the strange note on the ground to Zheng Yan, "Can you decipher it?" He then opened the door and clapped his hands. Tsurumi used the old-fashioned method to greet the maid because he saw that most of the furnishings here were old-fashioned Japanese.

The maid did not respond. As Zheng Yan was staring at the note in a daze, he suddenly realized that Tsurumi was clapping his hands to greet the maid, so he immediately jumped up from the chair, glanced around, saw a light switch on the side of the door, and went forward to press it a couple of times, still staring at the strange note:

"The Hualu Hotel is one of the large hotels opened by Westerners."

"Where is it?" Tsurumi looked at Lin Zheng Yan, but his expression was obviously a little uncomfortable.

"In the central district, at the mouth of the Bund," Zheng Yan replied, "This number is strange, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the hotel."

"How do you know?"

"No road in Shanghai has this number, and no residential area or hotel room would have this number - no strange number starting with '〇'." Lin Zheng Yan was very sure.

"Ha... besides the house number, do you have any other insights?" Tsurumi asked.

"I'm afraid I can't guess... did this note was left by the lady who came with the captain?" Zheng Yan carefully placed the note on the table.

"Oh... I forgot to tell you;" Tsurumi briefly explained what happened when he disembarked in the morning in a few words.

"I can ask a friend to inquire about this. He may be able to explain..."

Tsurumi was about to ask who this friend was, but he found that the maid was already standing outside the door.

"Please come in," Tsurumi nodded to the maid, "I want to ask you something, that is: Has Miss Nakamura returned?" Tsurumi's words were a little rambling, which shows that his mind was confused.

"No,..." the maid seemed very happy.

"I know, did you hear Miss Nakamura say where she was going?"

The maid was still trying to recall, but Lin Zheng Yan interjected:

"I did hear that... Miss Nakamura seemed to have asked the steward below, "How long does it take to go to the embassy by car?... How far is the Bimao Hotel from the embassy?" etc."

### Competing with Old Shanghai

— Ye Lin

Many people are glad that this war did not cause excessively serious damage to Shanghai. In fact, this is a short-sighted statement. This war exhausted the construction of the city, causing the construction of our city to stop for ten years, and even now it is still in a state of semi-stagnation. These ten years have caused the phenomenon of "crowding" and "chaos" in our city today.

Originally, "crowding" and "chaos" can be overcome by the three-dimensional and planar construction and development of the city, but today, none of us dare to or can have such extravagant hopes. Therefore, although this is a metropolis, vacant land still exists in the urban area. Therefore, although this is a city that never sleeps, dilapidated villages are at the end of the street and around the suburbs. Everyone will feel that such a city, such prosperity of the city is built on the extravagant enjoyment of a few and the many unemployed.

Therefore, our city cannot maintain order and tranquility, and balance of state. The housing shortage has caused worker anemia, narrow roads have frozen pedestrians and vehicles, the recession has caused factories to close, employees to lose their jobs, and high prices have formed an inevitable phenomenon: the desertedness of department stores, and the sales figures cannot rise in proportion to prices, because unemployment, the freezing of indexes, and the meager general treatment have limited purchasing power.

Before the war, when the concessions existed, the Ziju had a Weixin, establishing a new city center to reduce and weaken the status and value of the concessions. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the municipal government has also entered the central area. Competition seems to no longer need to exist. In fact, competition should be deeper and broader, because our city is facing a crisis, and should compete on a larger scale with "crowding" and "chaos", with housing shortages, with streets that are too narrow, with too many traffic accidents, with the recession of industry and commerce, and with the unemployment of two or three million people.

Only when this competition is won can it truly be a victory for Greater Shanghai.

### On the Rule of Law

— Xin

Recently, I received a package of books from America, wrapped in an old newspaper. Upon opening it, I found it was a September 29, 1943, issue of the New York Herald Tribune. In an inconspicuous corner of the back page, there was a news item:

"Mrs. Claire Clancy, an elderly woman residing at 2033 Queens Boulevard, in this city, went to Cliffner Park in Nakamura on March 12, 1941, for recreation. On that day, due to heavy snow, Mrs. Clancy slipped and fell by the roadside, injuring the tendons in her right leg. After being treated in the hospital, she recovered after six months. Upon discharge, she hired a lawyer to sue the New York City government, accusing it of negligence in failing to sweep the streets, resulting in injury to pedestrians, and demanding compensation for damages. After more than a year of litigation and repeated trials, the Queens Supreme Court finally rendered a verdict yesterday, finding the Mrs. Clancy's accusations to be completely reasonable, and ordering the city government to compensate Mrs. Clancy for damages of $12,500. Furthermore, because the husband lost his wife's domestic labor during her hospital stay, the city government should also compensate $2,500 for this loss of domestic life."

The reasons the Supreme Court based its ruling on were: The main purpose of people paying taxes to the city government is for the city government to maintain public order, street cleanliness, and the safety of citizens within the city. The city government's failure to sweep the streets, resulting in injury to pedestrians, is the city government's fault, so it should be responsible for compensation.

This seems like a very ordinary matter to Americans, otherwise this news wouldn't have been printed in an inconspicuous place, but in our opinion, it is quite an extraordinary news story.

The rule of law is not only about people obeying the law, but also about the government obeying the law. People who break the law will naturally be punished by the law, and the government is the same. Despite the many shady dealings in American politics, it truly respects the rights of the people.

### Two Monks

— Xuan Shi

Two monks from Jing'an Temple, De Wu and Mi Jia, were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for treason. A certain evening newspaper added a sentence after the verdict, "Appropriately reserve living expenses for family members." This was probably because the same thing was written so many times that such a stroke was unconsciously added. In fact, the two monks (in the verdict) had no family members, so their property can be said to have been exceptionally completely confiscated.

Since monks have renounced the world, of course they have no family members. However, in this society, it is not easy to truly renounce the world. Not to mention monks who do not abide by the precepts and keep wives and concubines, even those truly solitary monks, how can they truly renounce the world? For example, the two monks above, although they have no dependents, they also have private property. With private property, they naturally have all the desires and troubles of laypeople. They are called renunciates, but in fact they have never truly left the circle of home.

This is still a minor saying. Renunciates are supposed to be free of worldly concerns, but reality is reality after all, and cannot be escaped. They can escape the small home of the family, but they cannot escape the large home of the country. The two monks above could not avoid being affected during the country's difficult times. Just because they took a path that violated national policy, they became two traitors. Similarly, Master Taixu is also a renunciate, and he also cannot escape the circle of the country. However, he is walking the same path taken by the entire country, and therefore he has become a hero of the resistance against Japan. Some people call him a political monk, but in this era, it is not very possible to have no relationship with politics. If monks are like this, then we laypeople who are not monks are even more so.

### Literary and Art Circles

Film Arts

### "From Black Night to Dawn"

— Wu Bian

Recently, many films have depicted underground workers as new heroes. The protagonist of this film, "From Black Night to Dawn," Zhu De, an underground worker, engaged in sabotage against collaborators and puppet regimes in the occupied areas during the Anti-Japanese War. After being arrested, he led his comrades in a prison break. After the victory, he led a group of refugees in building roads, eliminating local tyrants, and working hard for rural construction. However, when we look through the newspapers, what kind of clownish faces do we often see in those who call themselves underground workers?

We do not deny the contribution of underground workers to the country's resistance against Japan during the war, but in this script, the author's depiction of Wang De is too deified. His escape from the enemy's prison happened to lead him to the home of the collaborator Huang Yimin (who was the informant who reported him to the enemy and caused his arrest), and he even happened to break into his daughter's room. When the enemy came into the room to search, they did not find him. However, in the scene, the enemy knocked on the door for a long time before Wang De opened the door, while the collaborator's daughter was sitting by the window far from the door. So who opened the door? Wouldn't the enemy find it suspicious? Then the enemy squad leader came in to solicit favors and was killed by Wang De with a vase. Wouldn't the translator and others outside the door hear any sound from inside the room? All of this makes it impossible for the audience to believe its possibility. And the arrangement of the plot is also coincidental everywhere, which inevitably weakens the truthfulness of the story.

Huang Mulan, the daughter of the collaborator, became a progressive girl after running away with Zhu De. After the victory, she strived to "take care of the children for everyone during the day and teach everyone to read at night," but in the picture, her beautiful and fashionable clothes, who can believe that she is a worker who goes deep into the people?

In short, this only exaggeratedly praises individual heroism, without the power of the broad masses. However, the collaborator in the author's writing later transformed himself and became the post-victory village chief, doing all kinds of evil. The arrangement of this character is the best part of the whole play.

It is touted as being performed by the entire cast of "Top Secret," but obviously this play is a failure. The looseness of the story and the weakness of the director's handling of the whole play are what doomed the fate of this play.

### Thoughts on Qingming Festival

— Fei Chen

For thousands of years, the Chinese people have been influenced by Confucianism and Buddhism, believing that those who "behave as human beings" must fulfill "filial piety." If they fail to "support" their ancestors wholeheartedly "during their lifetime," then they must find ways to "honor their ancestors and elevate their family after death."

Returning to the ancestral tombs to "sweep the graves" during the Qingming Festival is also a way to honor the family and show off in the village.

But in this 20th century, in the 1950s, these descendants are tumbling in the great torrent of history. Some have lost their fields and destroyed their homes in wars and unemployment waves. Facing the lush ancestral tombs, how will they weep bitterly!

Some, although they wore the crown of betraying the nation in the war, those who know the times are heroes, and they still return home in glory. If the ancestors knew, would they be angry or ashamed to face such descendants?

Some sons and daughters have not had enough clothes or food for the past ten years, and have been struggling for half their lives. Today they can [illegible] before the spirits of their ancestors, will they cry [illegible], or will they sob silently?

If today's "Qingming Festival" is still "bitter rain and desolation," then most of the descendants on the road will have no tears to cry for the sake of life and future.

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

Lan herself had not told Lao Zhu about these situations; rather, Lao Zhu had found out from the conversations of Xu Shaoming and his wife, and Fei Fei.

The commotion in the small alley gradually subsided, but outside on Liuhe Road, it was already a scene of busy traffic again. Separated by a large courtyard, Lao Zhu could constantly hear the sounds of cars and people clamoring.

He sat alone on the bamboo couch, deep in thought, and couldn't think of any good solutions for a while. He sighed, jumped up, put on his khaki Hawaiian shirt, and casually took a toffee from his pocket and put it in his mouth. Then he picked up the cold water bottle on the table and drank three or four mouthfuls in a row.

"5111..." He walked down from the narrow and broken wooden ladder, unconsciously whistling again.

Only one school worker was left in the elementary school, and he had not yet gotten up. He opened the gate himself and walked onto the street.

The blue-gray dawn shone all over the suburbs of Guilin, the mountains were still so clear, the water was still so beautiful, but the people were so chaotic! After walking through Liuhe Road and turning onto Jiangan Road, what he saw before him was simply a surging sea of people, cars, goods, and luggage. No one was not rushing around in a panic, and no car was not heavily loaded with all kinds of things. Lao Zhu felt a chill in his heart, and felt that this scene was somewhat ominous.

Those exquisitely beautiful small Western-style houses in the Dongjiang District were all in a mess, and the well-maintained flower beds were trampled beyond recognition.

"Okay! Poor people. Keep accumulating! Keep plundering! Keep reveling! See when you will wake up!" He, a poor dramatist, really felt like the happiest person in the world at this moment! No family, no property, no goods, and no insatiable greed. Now he could coldly watch those guys who were usually obsessed with profit and greed, scurrying away like dogs who lost their homes.

After crossing the Dongjiang Bridge, he stood at the bridge pier, hesitating and unable to decide where to go first, when he suddenly heard a woman's voice calling him. Before he could turn around to look, a small car that wasn't very new had already driven up to him.

A woman with curly hair jumped out of the car, and Lao Zhu's eyes lit up. It turned out to be Jin Aili. Having not seen her for three days, Jin Aili had changed. Her original shabby clothes had been replaced with bright new clothes, and she looked much more energetic. There was a hint of joy in her eyebrows and eyes.

"Lao Zhu, where are you going?" She smiled charmingly at him, originally wanting to reach out and shake Lao Zhu's hand, but immediately seemed to remember that there was a driver watching in the car, so she temporarily retracted her hand. (3)(5)
