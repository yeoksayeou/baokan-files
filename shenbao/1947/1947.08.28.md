### The Government and Public Pay Close Attention to the Wei Envoy's Statement, Supervisory Yuan Actively Discusses and Participates, Believing It Involves Internal Affairs, a Matter of Regret, Supervisory Committee Resolves to Urge the Government to Strictly Implement the Reform Plan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] At a press conference held by Vice Minister Ye Gongchao of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau on the 27th, when asked about "whether the government has any critical opinions regarding General Wedemeyer's farewell statement," he replied: "Regarding the Chinese government's attitude towards General Wedemeyer's statement, I have nothing to report at this time. However, when General Wedemeyer was in China (before his farewell statement), the government provided him with a written explanation outlining China's problems, as well as the government's position and attitude. The content will be published in Nanjing by the Chinese government when General Wedemeyer returns to Washington."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Wedemeyer's farewell statement upon leaving China has aroused widespread repercussions among the government and the public. Some members of the Political Consultative Conference held a discussion meeting on the morning of the 27th to discuss whether or not to express their views on Wedemeyer's statement. Participants included members Chen Yaodong, Yin Shuxian, Da Pusheng, Wang Huamin, Wu Chunwu, Qiu Changwei, Fan Yusui, and others. It was generally believed that Wedemeyer's remarks involved China's internal affairs, and considerable indignation was expressed. Chen Yaodong and others believed that: (1) Since China and the United States are friendly countries, China should not be underestimated, and especially should not be placed alongside Korea as an object of investigation. Why didn't the diplomatic authorities reject this beforehand? (2) The United States should also bear part of the responsibility for China's years of internal strife. The United States' policy towards the East has never been determined, which is incomprehensible. However, many of Wedemeyer's words are also worthy of reflection. If our country wants to become an independent and autonomous nation, the government and the public should resolutely launch a national reform movement, eradicate corruption, especially starting from the local level, and find ways to effectively guarantee the lives of public educators, making fundamental plans. Wedemeyer obtained a lot of information, but what he heard and said is not enough to represent the true opinions of the people. Fan Yusui also pointed out that American policy decisions are based on the interests of businessmen, and at the same time, they plan to use China as a base for attacking the Soviet Union, which is difficult to agree with. Yin Shuxian also believed that it was problematic in terms of diplomatic etiquette for Wedemeyer to make such remarks as a diplomatic envoy. During his time in China, Wedemeyer contacted mostly party members, and had little contact with representatives of the people, so he still lacked a complete understanding of the China problem. It is truly strange to us that a democratic country like the United States does not value public opinion and places too much emphasis on party opinions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Supervisory Yuan recently held a discussion meeting to study in detail the farewell statement issued by Special Envoy Wedemeyer. Most Supervisory Committee members agreed that many of Wedemeyer's statements were indeed facts, but the Supervisory Committee members had already impeached or suggested the points he mentioned, such as corruption and incompetence, to the government. This time, we troubled a friendly country to reiterate them. Although the speech was delivered in the spirit of a candid friend, the above points are all internal affairs and have long been valued by the censors. It seems unnecessary to restate them, so in general, everyone expressed regret over Wedemeyer's remarks. Based on the above points of view, all comrades made the following four important decisions: (1) To announce the "Emergency Proposal for Reforming Politics and Restoring Public Confidence" passed by the Supervisory Yuan last month. This proposal was passed by the Supervisory Yuan before Wedemeyer came to China and has already been submitted to the government. All the points mentioned in Wedemeyer's statement are listed, and because the Chinese are more familiar with and understand China, the suggestions are more specific and feasible. (2) The issue of using Chinese people's deposits abroad was raised and passed at the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee several years ago, and the "Emergency Proposal for Reforming Politics and Restoring Public Confidence" proposed by the Supervisory Yuan also mentioned it. The situation of the execution of this matter should be investigated. (3) The report said, "Some Supervisory Committee members feel regret that Wedemeyer's statement failed to give clear support to China's economy." This statement can never represent the will of all Supervisory Committee members and should be denied. (4) The Supervisory Yuan has a legal basis for exercising its supervisory powers, but many proposals and impeachment cases have been shelved. This will be presented to the State Council, hoping that it will respect the power of supervision. The Supervisory Yuan's discussion meeting was held recently, chaired by Chairman Xiang Naiqi. More than 20 Supervisory Committee members attended, including Mei Quanren, Ma Yaonan, Fan Zhengbo, Mao Shaosui, Wang Guanwu, Liu Shidu, Yang Zongpei, Jiang Can, Miao Peicheng, Cao Haosen, Wu Rugongge, Li Zhengle, and Yu Shude.

### Supervisory Committee's Urgent Proposal Requests Earnest Rectification of Officialdom

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The content of the "Emergency Proposal for Reforming Politics and Restoring Public Confidence" recently resolved to be published by the Supervisory Yuan at the symposium is as follows:

First, in terms of politics: (1) Punish corruption severely to restore order. A. Increase the penalties in the regulations for severely punishing corrupt officials. In addition to the original sentence, anyone convicted of corruption should have all their property confiscated. B. Formulate regulations to reward those who report corruption and formulate laws for the joint liability of corruption. C. Implement property registration for officials. D. Strengthen the work of the Political Affairs Official Disciplinary Committee and the Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee, and establish a Leading Official Disciplinary Committee as soon as possible. E. The impeachment cases that the Supervisory Yuan has transferred for disciplinary action should be handled quickly by the relevant disciplinary authorities in accordance with the law and must not be delayed, allowing the impeached person to remain at large. In addition, personnel who have been disciplined and suspended from employment must not be employed for any reason during the period of suspension. The cases of malfeasance that have been investigated by the Task Force for Investigating Enemy and Puppet Materials should be handled in accordance with the law and the results should be announced. F. The main illegal personnel and merchants involved in the last gold rush and the current food and commodity price rush should be punished in accordance with the law.

(2) Practice strict economy and strictly prohibit each hall. A. Continue to implement the austerity measures during the Anti-Japanese War. B. Strictly prohibit the import and circulation of luxury goods. C. Except for the heads of important agencies who are allowed to ride in cars, all other personnel, whether riding in public or private cars, should be taxed with the heaviest luxury tax. D. Strictly prohibit civil and military officials from going to Lushan to escape the heat.

(3) Strictly implement the separation of military and civilian affairs. Those in charge of local governments who are military personnel should be replaced by non-military personnel within a time limit.

(4) Strictly prohibit concurrent positions and implement one person, one position, especially for officials in charge, who should be absolutely prohibited from concurrent positions to focus on their responsibilities.

(5) The selection of senior government officials should pay attention to talents from all regions of the country and give them appropriate distribution, striving to avoid one region or family occupying the majority of important positions.

(6) Implement a talent-based politics, establish a personnel system, eradicate all the evils of factionalism, and implement the system of administrative officials leaving political parties.

(7) Strictly implement the method of dividing administrative responsibilities. Every agency and every position must have certain powers and responsibilities that cannot be changed due to personnel changes. For example, the Central Bank originally belonged to the Ministry of Finance, but in the past it was directly commanded by the President of the Executive Yuan. Also, the Party and Government Work Assessment Committee and the Ministry of National Defense Supervision Bureau have encroached on the powers of the Supervisory Yuan, which are clear examples.

(8) Abolish the special local system, such as the Northeast Headquarters currently setting up two committees, economic and political, to govern the economy and politics of the northeastern provinces and the currency system of northeastern Taiwan.

(9) Abolish redundant agencies, eliminate redundant personnel, and adjust the organization of various agencies to increase administrative efficiency and save the national treasury. A. Agencies with the same nature should be merged, such as goods tax bureaus and direct tax bureaus at all levels, which should be merged into one tax agency. The Ministry of Food should be abolished immediately, and food administration and land tax should be unified, and the tax authorities and their staff should be greatly reduced. B. Agencies that are too large, such as the Ministry of National Defense, Economy, and Finance and their affiliated agencies, should be appropriately abolished or simplified. C. Agencies with too many personnel should implement reductions. D. Agencies whose establishment is inappropriate should be rationally adjusted, such as the Central Party and Government Work Assessment Committee and the Central Design Bureau, whose work and institutions should be appropriately merged or reorganized.

(10) Strictly implement the Public Treasury Law to prevent the misuse of public funds and the use of public funds for private gain and other malpractices.

(11) Improve and standardize the treatment of public educators. A. The treatment of all public educators should be appropriately adjusted according to the price index or other reasonable standards to ensure that the regular treatment can guarantee the stability of their lives. B. The treatment of personnel in various state-run transportation, enterprises, finance, and financial institutions, in addition to those stipulated by the central government, must not be established under various names and paid separately, otherwise it should be regarded as corruption. C. No agency shall use its own income or the use of public funds to make special and superior equipment for the establishment and employee welfare of the agency.

Second, in terms of economy:

(1) Tighten fiscal expenditures. A. Stop paying all unnecessary national treasury expenditures, such as the construction of the National Assembly Hall, the construction of Lushan, and other expenses. B. Tighten emergency payment orders. C. Thoroughly liquidate the use of foreign exchange and punish those who waste it. D. Tighten all unnecessary agricultural, industrial, and commercial loans and strictly limit the manipulation and profiteering of various loans by a small number of people.

(2) Prevent the disparity between the rich and the poor and correct the current bad phenomenon of the poor's tax burden being too heavy and the rich's burden being too light. A. Confiscate the deposits of Chinese people in foreign banks and properties abroad within a time limit. B. Levy progressive property taxes within a time limit. C. Resolutely ban all bureaucratic capital enterprises, such as China Construction Banking Corporation, Yangzi Company, Zhongfu Company, and similar institutions in various places, as well as commercial firms with senior officials as the backbone. D. The land tax collection should stipulate a minimum exemption amount for all land and strive for the equalization of the tax burden.

(3) Strictly supervise financial undertakings.

### Joint Council of Four Banks Discusses Loan Policy

Treatment of National Bank Personnel Also Discussed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] When the Joint Office of the Four Banks holds a council meeting on the 28th, the loan policy and the treatment of personnel in the national banks will be the main topics. Regarding the loan policy, some people suggest stopping lending in the future. Even if it is not stopped in the future, it will be tightened. As for the treatment of personnel in state-run industries, the Joint Office of the Four Banks originally planned a method, but the Executive Yuan did not discuss it. Recently, it issued an order to China Merchants and China Textile to handle it as a special project, but the actual income must not exceed that of July.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Notifies Various Agencies to Recommend Business Representatives to Japan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently notified various provincial and municipal governments, the National Federation of Industries, and the Federation of Commerce, etc., to quickly recommend candidates for the business delegation to Japan that should be sent from each locality. The rumor that the candidates have been internally determined is not true. In addition, the method of recommending representatives from various places will be determined by themselves. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has not stipulated any unified method, and the departure date of the first batch of delegations may be in late September if the selection goes smoothly in various places. In addition, some people in Shanghai expressed dissatisfaction with the import of bicycles, but in fact, there are no bicycles among the imported goods.

### The World is Brewing a Third World War, Greece Will Be the Fuse, Shocking Remarks by Eaton, Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, Tito Declares that the South is Preparing for War

[Our News] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Eaton, Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, made shocking remarks today, saying: "Greece may become the powder keg that ignites the Third World War. The situation in Greece now contains various factors that could cause a war to break out. The United States will never relax in Greece. The United States and the Soviet Union have both stated that they will fully support their positions in Greece. If neither side compromises, the results will be unimaginable."

[Our News] London, 27th Broadcast: Yugoslav leader Tito made tough remarks today, saying: Atomic bombs and war cannot scare Yugoslavia. The Southern army is ready for war at any time.

[Our News] London, 27th Broadcast: According to a telegram from Salonica, guerrillas mixed with Bulgarians invaded the village of Baroli near Florina. The guerrilla leader told the villagers there that if the United States interfered in Greece's internal affairs, a large team of Soviet, Bulgarian, and Yugoslav troops would be ready to invade Greece.

### Soviet Ships Operating in the Bohai Sea Area, We Are Devising Effective Countermeasures, Vice Minister Ye Reiterates Sovereignty Over Dalian

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Vice Minister Ye Gongchao answered the following questions about Hulun at a press conference held by the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau on the 27th:

Q: When the Chinese government announced the temporary closure of the port of Dalian, did it know that the United States had protested to the Soviet Union for not allowing foreign ships to sail to the port?

A: The Chinese government knew nothing about the US protest to the Soviet Union until it was published in the newspapers. According to the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty, Dalian will be opened as a free port, and foreign ships can freely enter and exit after the opening. However, the situation that has occurred since 1940 has made it impossible for the Chinese government to take over the port in accordance with the treaty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on June 25 gave a detailed explanation of the various obstacles hindering the takeover. The Chinese government may be able to announce the opening of the port after taking over Dalian, and the port belongs to Chinese sovereignty, and any other country shall not use it alone according to law, which is obvious. Before the Chinese government announces the opening of the port, especially since the war against Japan no longer exists in fact, all foreign ships, including Soviet ships, cannot legally enter the port without China's special permission. Furthermore, foreign ships cannot engage in coastal trade in China. Therefore, no foreign ships can transport goods or passengers between any two Chinese ports, including Dalian.

I do not believe that the Chinese government's statement can mislead anyone about its true meaning.

Q: Since the port of Dalian has not been announced open since the victory, what is the special significance of the Chinese government's announcement of "temporary closure"? What will be different before and after the announcement of "temporary closure"?

A: The government's announcement of "temporary" closure has two important meanings. One is to ensure our country's coastal trade rights. Recently, Soviet ships have frequently traveled between Shanghai and Dalian to carry passengers and goods. This has damaged our coastal navigation rights, which we have struggled to eliminate unequal treaties for many years. This announcement is a solemn statement that our country's sovereignty is inviolable. In the future, our customs will prevent and punish any foreign ships sailing, carrying passengers, and unloading in our coastal areas according to law. The second is to reaffirm the legal status of our sovereignty over Dalian. The fact that Dalian belongs to Chinese sovereignty has an undeniable basis in legal fact. We can consider any steps to maintain our country's sovereignty in the future.

Q: I heard that our navy has implemented a blockade of Dalian and Yantai. If Soviet ships continue to act as before, what effective countermeasures will our side take?

A: The navy has told us that the situation in Dalian and Yantai can be understood clearly from the map without saying more. However, I must solemnly state that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Executive Yuan have never used the word "blockade." The Communist bandits are traitors to the country, and we cannot recognize them as belligerent groups. Effective countermeasures for the actions of Soviet ships in the Bohai Sea area are currently being discussed.

### Fierce Fighting Continues on the Outskirts of Shijiazhuang

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 27th] Fierce fighting continues on the outskirts of Shijiazhuang. The Kuomintang troops are firmly guarding each stronghold within 20 li of the city. Last night, the bandits formed an arc-shaped battle line and attacked the 20-li Pu, Baifo Village, Fang Village, and other places in the southeast suburbs. Currently, the Kuomintang troops are continuing to reinforce and attack on multiple routes. A part of the bandits' New Eighth Brigade and the Third Column are trapped in the Kuomintang's encirclement and are resisting fiercely.

### More Than 50,000 Communist Bandits Cross the Yellow River in Western Henan, Fierce Fighting in Northwest Luoyang, Remnant Bandits in Southern Henan Fall into Two Encirclements

[Our Luoyang Dispatch, 27th] More than 50,000 Communist bandits crossed the river, all of them were the troops defending Yan'an, and they attacked Shaanluoxuan. The Kuomintang troops arrived and were engaged in fierce fighting. Gunfire could be heard in Luoyang city.

[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 27th] The northwest and east sides of Luoyang have presented a general encirclement situation, but fierce fighting is still going on. The Fourth Column's Tenth Brigade, which was painfully attacked at Hengshui, launched four fierce attacks on our garrison last night, but were all repelled, killing more than 1,000 bandits and seizing a lot of spoils. Another group of bandits appeared to be attacking Matun in northwest Luoyang. The telephone lines that were being urgently repaired westward from Luoyang have reached the outskirts of Xinan City.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 27th] The Kuomintang troops exited Luoyang on the 27th, and the bandits in the Nanmatun and Shipibeiao areas have already fled north. The Kuomintang troops are currently tracking and pursuing them.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 27th] The Kuomintang troops in southern Henan used the natural barrier of the Huai River to divide the remnants of Liu Bocheng's bandits into two, and they have fallen into two encirclements north and south of the Huai River. The Liu bandits' Second and Third Columns on the south bank of the Huai River have been surrounded by the Kuomintang troops in the Huangchuan and Gushi areas and will be difficult to escape. The Kuomintang troops on the north bank of the Huai River are now using overwhelming superior forces to attack the remnants of the Liu bandits' Sixth and Seventh Columns, more than 10,000 people, who are staying in the small areas of Baoxinji (Xincai), Lukouji (north of Xixian), and Banqiaoji (south of Zhengyang), and are attacking them in multiple ways to tighten the encirclement. The remnants of the Liu bandits in southern Henan are like fish in a cauldron.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 27th] More than 10,000 people from Liu Bocheng's Third and Sixth Columns occupied Gushi and Huangyong. The Guhuang line was united in one breath. The Kuomintang reinforcements adopted an urgent marching posture from Yingshang, Nanzhaoji, Huoqiu, and Yeji to attack Guhuang in multiple ways and launched a major war. The morale of the Kuomintang troops was very high, and the recovery of the two counties was imminent.

### Seven Japanese Ships Assigned to Our Country Arrive in Qingdao

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 27th] The third batch of eight Japanese ships handed over to our country arrived at Dagong Island at 6:30 am on the 27th.

### Red Kapok Blooms in the South

— Bu Shaofu

…Southern Wanderings, Miscellany Three

Although I stayed in Guangzhou for nearly ten days this trip, I am very ashamed that if someone were to ask me about the political situation in Guangdong or my impressions of Guangdong, I would find it difficult to give a concrete answer. However, during my time in Guangzhou, from the director of the Military Affairs Commission, the provincial chairman, to the waiters at the guest house, I was embarrassed by questions similar to the above.

What I know is too limited. We are just sightseeing and visiting, and even these are just superficial. Therefore, how dare I make wild comments?

A friend from Guangdong once told me the following:

"Red kapok trees grow all over Guangdong, and Guangzhou even uses it as its city flower. This tree is also known as the hero tree in Guangdong because if it grows among other trees, it will definitely grow taller than the others. No matter how tall the other trees are, it will be even taller. In short, it wants to stand out from the crowd. The red kapok is fragile, and its wood cannot be used as a building material, but its posture is upright and its colors are bright."

I don't dare say for sure why this Guangdong friend told me this. Is he hinting at something to me? As for whether it can represent Guangdong, you can investigate it!

Director Zhang Fakui of the Military Affairs Commission returned from a pleasure trip to Taiwan while we were in Haikou. On August 12, we returned to Guangzhou from Haikou, and on the 13th, we went to the Military Affairs Commission to visit him at noon. We had a 25-minute conversation in the reception room. This was my third meeting with Mr. Zhang Xianghua. The first time was in the autumn of the 27th year [of the Republic] on the Yangxin front line in Hubei, when he was the commander-in-chief of the First Army Corps during the Battle of Wuhan. The second time was in the autumn of the 33rd year [of the Republic] at Mr. Bai Chongxi's mansion in Liziba, Chongqing, when he was the commander of the Fourth War Zone, and Guilin had already been abandoned. Although he looked older than in our previous two meetings, with more gray hairs, his spirit and demeanor were even more radiant and elegant than before, and he seemed to be in high spirits and happy. A 25-minute conversation cannot provide definitive answers to any question, especially since he is so familiar with the life of a reporter, and especially since he also stated that certain things "should not be published." One thing that can be mentioned here is that I once asked him:

"In the two years since the victory of the War of Resistance, now that you've returned to Guangdong, what do you consider to be the most satisfying, enjoyable, and successful thing? What is the most unpleasant, worrying, and painful?"

Without hesitation, he said:

"The former is presiding over the surrender of the Japanese army in South China, and the latter is the banditry and security problems in Guangdong Province."

When someone asked about the local political situation, he pointed to the right with his right hand:

"That's next door's business" (the Provincial Government was to the right of the Military Affairs Commission).

There was no opportunity to talk to him again after that.

On the morning of the same day (August 13), Provincial Chairman Luo Zhuoying came to the Dongyuan Guesthouse in Dongshan where we were staying, and that evening at 8 p.m. he invited us to his official residence for dinner. I will describe that dinner in detail in another article. What I want to bring up first is a question I asked him:

"If the Central Government now has a new appointment for you, and this appointment is either Premier of the Executive Yuan or Chief of the General Staff, and the Central Government has no fixed opinion and leaves the choice to you, which position would you choose?"

He hesitated for a long time, then turned to his wife and asked:

"What do you think I would choose?"

Before his wife could answer, I said:

"If your answer is 'It depends on the Central Government's intentions, decided by the Central Government,' or 'I will obey the Central Government's orders,' I would not be satisfied, and I would not consider it an answer."

Mrs. Luo didn't seem to care and still said:

"He is a soldier..."

The Chairman then continued:

"It depends on the Central Government's needs for me, and how I can contribute to the country..."

Mayor Ouyang Ju's office is currently the most magnificent and luxurious place in Guangzhou, reminding me of the old Ministry of Railways and the destroyed former Ministry of Communications in Nanjing. It was built during Chen Jitang's time before the war and was the headquarters of the Japanese Southern China Command during the occupation, so it was preserved intact. We went to see him before going to Hainan Island. It was a hazy day, and a low-pressure system brought showers. The mayor's robust physique and cheerful voice gave me a strong impression of being decisive and getting things done. He repeatedly emphasized to us the difficulty of Guangzhou's recovery after being destroyed. But he also said with great confidence: This is not impossible, it can definitely be done well. He asked us to tell him what Guangzhou should promote and reform, saying: If you see anything wrong, please don't hesitate to tell me, and I will definitely take responsibility and work hard to correct it.

After that, we had the pleasure of sitting at the same table with him once. He had a good capacity for alcohol and knew the drinking customs, so we didn't have the chance to talk about any more issues.

The custom of drinking tea is very popular in Guangdong. People even drink tea three times a day. The so-called "one pot, two pieces" costs several thousand yuan in Guangzhou today. If you only drink ten pots and eat two pieces, it might only take a few minutes, but each time for morning tea, afternoon tea, and evening tea, people rarely spend less than an hour. Reading the newspaper, chatting, and discussing business are the main activities. Therefore, all kinds of unimaginable rumors spread quickly in Guangzhou. People say that the source of lies in Guangdong is the tea houses, and the tea drinkers are either the creators or the disseminators, which is not without basis. Unfortunately, some colleagues are often careless or have other reasons, using tea house news as their main source of information or exclusive news, so readers are often confused, and the authorities are dizzy from these "Reuters" (as Zhang Fakui put it) news reports all day long. Among these news reports, personnel changes make up the largest part. For example, after the Yingde massacre on the Yuehan Railway, the news of the dismissal of Bureau Chief Du Zhenyuan came out, followed by the news of Xie Wenlong (the current director of the Provincial Construction Department) being transferred to the position of Bureau Chief. The proposal to change Meinan to a special zone was not yet finalized, and the appointment of Zhang Fakui as commander and the candidates for various positions were announced. During my time in Guangzhou, many people asked me, "When will Mr. Liang Hancao come to Guangdong?" I knew that the rumors of Luo Zhuoying's departure must be spreading everywhere. These rumors were being tossed back and forth between Nanjing and Guangzhou, as hot as fire and as if they were real, and I worried that the emotions of administrative personnel at all levels would not be affected in the slightest.

He also called on comrades of the Kuomintang and friends of other parties to redouble their efforts to advance toward the Great Harmony world envisioned by the Father of the Nation. Finally, he called on the people of the world: "For the realization of world peace for humanity, our ancient sages wrote down a plan 2,400 years ago. Please review it carefully."

### The Inside Story of the Hong Kong General Strike

— From Zijing, sent from Hong Kong

Following the announcement on August 22nd that the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway could not operate, the Hong Kong machinists' general strike has entered a new phase. Since the strike began on the 15th, the situation in Hong Kong has not been as severe as initially imagined. Water and electricity are still supplied as usual, and public buses and ferries continue to maintain city transportation. Merchants who initially raised prices out of panic (especially rice merchants) seem too embarrassed to continue raising prices. During that week, Hong Kong residents did not see the threat or inconvenience of the machinists' general strike because the striking units were mostly shipyards and cement plants, which did not directly affect the general public's lives. However, the British side already felt somewhat of a headache because: (1) the British were the bosses of those striking units; (2) machinists at the Hong Kong Hotel, the Peninsula Hotel, and the Repulse Bay Hotel, where the British reside, and machinists at the Milk Company ice factory, on which the British rely for food, followed suit by announcing strikes, and the British already felt considerable threats to their daily lives; (3) the Hong Kong government had already transferred some military engineering personnel before the strike was announced, preparing to take over the engine rooms of various factory units at any time. However, military technicians are not comparable to skilled workers; however, they can still cope before the machines are seriously damaged.

Machinists at the power plant, tram, telephone bureau, and waterworks bureau did not jointly announce a strike out of concern for the welfare of over a million citizens. However, machinists at the waterworks bureau later also gradually handed over their work to the bureau. As of the 23rd, only 41 waterworks machinists in Hong Kong and Kowloon were paid daily, and there were still over ten who were paid monthly. If the machines were damaged, they would be unable to repair them, and citizens would face the risk of partial water outages at any time.

The progress of the Hong Kong machinists' general strike is outwardly strong but inwardly tense, becoming more urgent day by day, and the threat to society is slowly becoming apparent. The Hong Kong government's Labour Department held the first negotiation with both labor and management on the fifth day after the general strike was implemented, attempting to break the deadlock. Management formally expressed its willingness to increase wages by 20 percent, which was far from the labor side's request for a 150 percent increase, and the meeting ended without result. Labor and management have now held three negotiations, but their opinions cannot be reconciled, and the impasse has formed again. The machinists' general strike this time has been brewing for seven months, and their attitude is very firm, with a determination not to rest until their goal is achieved. The cost of living in Hong Kong is very high, and workers' daily wages are only two dollars. Although there is a living allowance of about seventy dollars per month, it is still not enough to make ends meet. The request for a 150 percent increase would increase the daily wage to five dollars, which is still far less than the wages of general Chinese-funded factories. Since last year, Chinese-funded factories have met workers' demands, with daily wages calculated at eight and ten dollars, in addition to the living allowance that should be provided. However, factories operated by the British or the Hong Kong government still pay wages according to pre-war standards after the war. The biggest reason why the British or the Hong Kong government are trying to maintain this low wage standard is to reduce the expenses of the British or the Hong Kong government. Therefore, the "profit" of the British is the "harm" of the Chinese workers, so although society is worried about the impact of the machinists' general strike, they still express sympathy for them.

On the 17th, the strike committee of the Chinese Machinists' Association issued a letter to all sectors of society, detailing the process of requesting wage increases and criticizing the management's lack of sincerity, which won the understanding and attention of society. On the 22nd, various British shipyards also issued a statement explaining the reasons for not accepting the machinists' demands: "The factories are overburdened, and the workers are also threatened with unemployment." Last year, the profits of various British shipyards ranged from over one million dollars to over two million dollars. These are all profits obtained by suppressing wages. As for the burden, since Chinese-funded factories can bear it, there is no reason why British-funded factories with advantages cannot bear it. The target of this strike is entirely those British-funded factories that have made huge profits and occupy advantages. It has a major significance for Chinese workers to demand wage increases and improved treatment from British employers. Therefore, other workers and even merchants believe that the machinists cannot fail in this labor unrest. They are prepared to sacrifice their own private interests to win back dignity and status for all Chinese workers and even Hong Kong and Chinese compatriots. (Sent on August 24th)

Editorial

### The Order to Improve County Administration Still Needs Supplementation

The Executive Yuan issued an order to improve county administration, listing five points: streamlining institutions, reorganizing finances, reducing concurrent positions, increasing authority, and carefully selecting officials, instructing all ministries, committees, and provincial governments to jointly plan and implement them, in order to seek the revitalization of local politics. Its words are quite profound and clear, and can quite well express the current truth of officialdom; the various measures set are also largely in line with current malpractices, and are no less than good medicine to remedy defects and correct deviations. Among them, the two points of streamlining organizations and broadening the tax base are particularly crucial as medicines for the symptoms. Because the greatest evil of the present day lies in disregard for the people's hardships and endless exactions; and the reason why this has come about is that maintaining redundant institutions and raising redundant personnel are the main reasons. These bad policies not only cause the masses to wail in pain and have no way to appeal, but even those involved in the matter are also in a state of exhaustion, believing it to be the most painful thing.

The original order did not further clarify the origin of this phenomenon, which we believe is worth supplementing. Although the ranks and establishments of counties are determined by the provinces themselves, the reason why the organization is so large and the financial expenses are so huge also have their own hidden pain in each province. For example, personnel for statistics, cooperation, personnel affairs, land registration, accounting, and measurement, etc., may be considered secondary by the Executive Yuan, and their establishment may be delayed or "necessary personnel may be selectively retained and assigned to departments with similar nature to handle matters"; however, the views of the superior authorities of these institutions are not entirely the same. Their position is naturally to strongly support them; they also have their own one-sided theories as talismans, and they have even more existing laws and regulations to forcibly base on. Recently, someone mentioned a matter, which can also be said to be a joke, which can very well serve as proof. One of the above-mentioned institutions initially planned a staff of four people, believing that it would be enough to cope with the situation. Who knew that when the report was sent up, its superior authority was greatly displeased, believing that for the same agency, the number of personnel was usually between ten and twenty people. How could this agency be so different? How could it be so few? Isn't it going to affect the staff size of its agency in other places? Later, it was finally increased to more than ten people. From this point of view, before the various ministries and committees of the central government have "understood the meaning of maintaining internal and external connections and unity between superiors and subordinates," whether this streamlining policy can be thoroughly implemented is still a question. Recently, it has also been rumored that certain provinces plan to implement the abolition and merger of agencies such as the Field Grain Bureau... in order to achieve real savings. Whether this matter can be done can be a touchstone for whether county-level institutions can be streamlined.

Then, why do the superior authorities insist on maintaining so many unnecessary branch institutions and personnel? Is their intention solely to expand their power? Or to arrange private appointments? In all fairness, this statement is also somewhat lacking in forgiveness. The focus of the problem is that the subjective views of various agencies are inconsistent on various administrations and various undertakings. Some believe it is extremely important, while others believe it is of no importance. This is the origin of the problem with many agencies today.

Secondly, the lack of a central institution to coordinate various political affairs in various places is the main reason for various wastes, confusions, and ineffective matters. It's not that there is truly no such institution, nor is it that there are truly no such officials, but that today's leaders are generally too magnanimous and very casual. Subordinate agencies issue orders and urge the county to handle matters one after another. This is originally a manifestation of working hard, and it is inconvenient to interfere, and there is no time to interfere. Thus, from the ministries and committees to the departments and offices, all are promoting their work, developing their ambitions, and enriching their institutions, allocating their funds, and decorating their facades. In this way, how can the organization of each county not be large? How can their expenses not be tight and difficult to collect? Despite scraping together resources to cope with the situation, financial resources are limited, and finally supply cannot meet demand. Then, in addition to setting up some institutions in name only and supporting a number of yuan officials, barely enough to cope with the situation, what other paths can be taken and what other things can be done?

Some facts, when spoken of, are quite worthy of eliciting sighs. Because each has its own supervisor and each seeks to expand, the finances of each county, in name, belong to unified collection and unified expenditure, but in reality, each has its own fixed amount, and there is no room for accommodation. Moreover, for the same set of established funds, the special funds for Yongli, road repair, and pest control are often heavily guarded and do not allow the chief officer in charge of a county to coordinate the handling. Some people are very strange about why the county magistrates of each county do not, according to the time and place, imitate Dan and come up with a whole plan of several years as an indicator of the county's annual administration, but they do not know that county administration is restricted in everything and everything must be presented for approval. The ministries and committees have their own overall management policies, and do not allow each county to have room for free planning according to the time and place. I am afraid that those who have not been county magistrates cannot deeply know the bitterness of county magistrates. In other words: the topic is set, and you county magistrate are not allowed not to do it. If you can't do it, you have to follow the regulations and cancel this case in public affairs; but what you really want to do locally is often tied to expenses and common practices, and you can't put all your efforts into it. To make an analogy: the government is like a big machine, and each county is a self-contained unit, and is a small machine attached to this big machine. At the very least, it should also be a whole wheel. But unfortunately, in reality, it is now only treated as a key or an attachment, and it is not regarded as a whole set. Not only are counties like this, but also provinces and municipalities directly under the central government. Therefore, in this situation of issuing orders and urging one after another, local officials seem to have a share in complying with them, and if they don't want to be complete "bureaucrats," they have no choice but to do so!

Looking at history, each dynasty has always had a few upright officials and good officials to decorate the historical records; and since the Republic of China, those who can peacefully retire and not be criticized or impeached are already a minority. We believe that the reason should be found in the above explanation. The responsibility lies less with those below and more with those above. Because, like Wen Weng, Xi Sui, Zhu Yi, Zhao Xinchen, Wei Sa, and Wang Huan in the Han Dynasty, each of their outstanding achievements was often only one or two things, such as teaching, managing rivers, suppressing bandits, and encouraging farming and mulberry cultivation. In today's chaotic and unreasonable multi-faceted urging, even if this group of upright officials were to come again, they would probably be at a loss as to what to do; or they might even be included in the list of incompetent and dismissed officials.

We do not want to make excuses or reduce the responsibility for the current group of incompetent county administration personnel. We really feel that the political orders are too numerous and too chaotic, and the superior authorities lack the obligation of assisting and guiding, and specialize in using their efforts on restraint, control, preventing abuses, and interfering, treating the county government like a branch of a company, and everything has to be submitted for approval and request for instructions, and everything must conform to the procedures, but the procedures are very trivial, and when requesting instructions, they often have to consult back and forth and fight repeatedly, making those responsible for handling affairs feel extremely headache! It is said that there was such a thing. The construction authority ordered a certain county to mobilize manpower and carry out large-scale river opening during the agricultural slack season, and it had to be completed within a time limit, and the official order was extremely strict. However, the budget it created was repeatedly rejected by the authority. After repeated exchanges, when the approved order arrived at the county, the period for completion was approaching. Only three days were left. What was the content of that budget? And should it be exchanged back and forth again? We certainly do not know; but how could the county have completed this project within these three days? Does the county magistrate really have the ability of Zhuge Liang borrowing the east wind?

The above situation, namely, the political orders are too numerous and too chaotic, and the control is too strict and too trivial, if these points cannot be corrected quickly, even if there are "outstanding scholars of equal rank who enter officialdom," and reducing the concurrent positions of the county magistrate and restricting the direct orders of various side institutions to the county magistrate, the county magistrates will still be stretched and exhausted to cope with, and county administration will still not be improved. We believe that to improve county administration, there are three most important points: it must be recognized that the county is an autonomous unit, and it should be allowed to have freedom of discretion within a considerable limit; this is one. The central government and the provinces should give overall consideration to county administration facilities, leaving ample room, and should not launch them simultaneously and be too numerous and trivial; this is the second. The superior authorities should focus on guidance and supplement what the counties lack, and should not be too restrictive; this is the third. The central government and the provinces should treat the counties in this way, and the central government should also treat the provinces and municipalities in this way. This is what we hope the Executive Yuan will reconsider and find ways to supplement.

### The Situation of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Remains Critical Our Government Expresses Deep Concern Believes that Overseas Chinese Should Have the Right to Self-Defense Our Country Decides to Demand Compensation for Losses from the Indonesian Authorities

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao, speaking on the issue of protecting overseas Chinese in Indonesia, stated: The situation of some Chinese nationals in Indonesia remains extremely critical. They have suffered significant losses due to various atrocities and destruction by Indonesian soldiers and civilians, and their sense of anger is very reasonable. The Chinese government has continuously negotiated with the Dutch government and Indonesian representatives that can be contacted on this matter. Our Consul-General in Batavia, Jiang Jiadong, flew to Yogyakarta yesterday. He is making every effort to rescue and protect overseas Chinese in disaster areas on the spot. At present, a ceasefire is most important. Regarding this matter, Chinese representatives have repeatedly made strong statements at the Security Council. We must emphasize that if the local authorities cannot provide sufficient protection to the overseas Chinese, then the overseas Chinese should be given the opportunity and equipment for self-defense.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao stated: "Overseas Chinese are different from overseas nationals of other countries. Their lives have an inseparable connection with their places of residence. Especially the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, who have reproduced for three hundred years, have a large population and an economically immovable position. The method of evacuating nationals from generally applicable countries is very difficult to apply. If troops are sent to protect them, a large number must be dispatched and prepared for combat, which is also something our side is unwilling to do. Therefore, in addition to our representative to the Security Council, Jiang Tingfu, repeatedly strongly advocating a ceasefire at the meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has long ordered our Consul-General in Batavia, Jiang Jiadong, to assist overseas Chinese in negotiating with the Dutch and Indonesian parties in various conflict areas to organize self-defense forces. This work has now been completed in three places, and the results of collective self-defense and maintaining order are very good."

[Reuters, Chenggong Lake, 26th] During the Security Council's debate on the Indonesian issue, Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu announced that China will demand compensation for the losses suffered by Chinese in Indonesia. Dutch representative Kryffens told the Council that outside the Dutch military lines, Indonesians had imprisoned four thousand Chinese in a cemetery, depriving them of food and shelter. The Dutch military could not bear to stand by and watch, so they disregarded the ceasefire order and rescued them. Jiang Tingfu admitted that the Indonesian army had forced 3,000 Chinese to evacuate their homes with them. Some of these Chinese have arrived in New York and are preparing to demand compensation for the loss of life and property. Jiang also stated that the Chinese government has no intention of arbitrarily interfering with the Indonesian struggle for independence, but will demand compensation for the losses of Chinese in Indonesia through normal channels.

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] Indonesian representative to the United Nations, Shari, stated: The Chinese delegation is in a difficult position due to complaints from the Dutch and overseas Chinese in the Dutch-occupied areas that some overseas Chinese have been mistreated by Indonesians. However, the Indonesian delegation is deeply satisfied that the Chinese delegation can uphold the principles established by Mr. Sun Yat-sen despite this serious obstacle. The Indonesian military and political authorities have issued orders to protect overseas Chinese and their property in riot areas. They have also stipulated that any Indonesian who provides assistance to overseas Chinese is subject to the death penalty. The President and Prime Minister of Indonesia have also stated that all overseas Chinese property losses caused by Indonesian actions will be fully compensated. As for the future protection of the lives and property of overseas Chinese, I can offer a guarantee.

### Security Council Passes Polish Proposal: Reaffirms Indo-Dutch Ceasefire Order, Sets Precedent for Intervention in Colonial Disputes

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 26th] The Security Council today passed the new Polish proposal with a decisive majority of ten votes, reaffirming the ceasefire order to both the Dutch and Indonesian sides.

[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 26th] Due to the unanimous agreement of the United States and the Soviet Union, the Security Council today reaffirmed the ceasefire order to both the Indonesian and Dutch sides, demanding strict compliance. The Security Council resolutely dispelled the doubts of countries with colonies as to whether the United Nations has the right to interfere in the Indonesian dispute. This matter creates a precedent with far-reaching impact, potentially opening avenues for future intervention in conflicts between colonial peoples seeking independence and their rulers. The Belgian representative proposed submitting the question of whether the United Nations has the right to interfere in the Indonesian dispute to the International Court of Justice for judgment, but it was rejected due to not obtaining the required majority of seven votes.

### Nordic Foreign Ministers' Meeting

### Minister of State for Burma Affairs Departs England for Rangoon

[United Press, London, 27th] The British Minister of State for Burma Affairs, Listowel, flew to Rangoon on the 27th to hold a two-week meeting with Burmese leaders. Secretary of Commerce Cripps originally planned to fly to Burma, but this has been canceled due to the economic crisis and is being replaced by Listowel.

[United Press, Rangoon, 26th] British Major Young has been arrested for befriending former Burmese Prime Minister U Saw.

### Britain, America, and France Reach Agreement on Raising German Industrial Standards

[Reuters, London, 26th] Authoritative sources report: The United States, Britain and France have reached a basic agreement on the key points of the level of industry in the British and American zones of Germany. France has acknowledged that a significant increase in the level of German industry in the British and American zones is necessary for European recovery, but that the increase in the level of industry should not grant the revival of the Ruhr industries a higher priority than the recovery plans of France and other allied countries in Europe. Authoritative sources also believe that the three-power conference this week has eliminated previous misunderstandings among the three powers regarding German industry, and the final meeting of the conference is scheduled for Wednesday.

### British Empire Discusses Japanese Peace Treaty: Opposes Use of Veto, Hopes Preliminary Conference Will Be Held Within One to Two Months

[Associated Press, Canberra, 26th] Representatives to this Commonwealth conference today expressed hope that a preliminary peace conference on Japan would be held within one to two months, so that the signing of a treaty could be completed in the first half of next year. The representatives also intend to raise the status of the peace conference convened by the United States to the level of decision-making. They had no disagreements on the main points, nor did any voting issues arise, but all strongly opposed the use of veto power in the future eleven-nation peace conference. The Australian representative believes that decisions at the conference should be made by a two-thirds majority vote. Tomorrow's meeting will discuss the disarmament of Japan and the British Empire's Pacific defense relationships.

Britain Determined to Stop Soviet Expansion

[Reuters, Canberra, 26th] This agency has learned from authoritative sources that the imperial leaders gathered here to discuss the Japanese peace treaty issue will decide to oppose any action that could increase Soviet influence in the Pacific region. Australia hopes that other participating countries will share its belief that the expansion of Soviet influence in the Pacific will be detrimental to the British Commonwealth in the Pacific. Australia and Britain do not advocate concluding a retaliatory peace treaty with Japan, as this would allow the Soviet Union to use Japan against other United Nations, especially the United States, and increase the Soviet Union's position in the Pacific.

Japanese Express Great Welcome and Plan to Send Telegram of Thanks

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] There is extraordinary enthusiasm here for the performance of the Canberra Conference, which is generally regarded as the result of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's visit to Tokyo. With such understanding between Evatt and MacArthur, there will certainly be a strong performance in the future peace conference on Japan. Some members of the House of Representatives are planning to initiate a parliamentary telegram to the Canberra Conference to express their gratitude, but they have not yet obtained the support of the majority of parties. Furthermore, diplomatic circles here are paying attention to the fact that India, Pakistan, and Burma are participating in this conference as independent entities. Whether the number of eleven countries will change in the future preparatory meeting and formal meeting for the Japanese peace treaty is worthy of attention.

### Pan-American Conference Passes Proposal: Defines Vast Defense Zone, Connects Arctic and Antarctic Oceans to Jointly Resist Aggression

[Associated Press, Petropolis, Brazil, 26th] The fourteen-nation small group of the Pan-American Defense Conference today passed the United States proposal to define a large-scale defense zone, extending from the Arctic Ocean to the Antarctic Ocean, to be defended by all countries in the Americas. Any part of the defense zone that is attacked should be met with joint military action. Most of the issues in the defense treaty have now been resolved, and the treaty is expected to be concluded quickly, perhaps by the weekend. The large-scale defense zone will include North and South America, Canada, Greenland, Alaska, the Falkland Islands, the South Orkney Islands, Antarctica, the South Sandwich and South Georgia Islands in the Antarctic Ocean, and a three-hundred-mile maritime zone surrounding the two continents, and include the strategic islands belonging to the American countries. According to United Press, if such a proposal is passed by the General Assembly and included in the collective defense pact, the Monroe Doctrine will no longer be the private property of the United States, and any American republic should invoke this doctrine to resist aggression.

### Voting System for Preliminary Japanese Peace Conference: China Proposes Compromise Suggestion with Important Revisions to US Proposal

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Vice Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao confirmed on the 27th that China had made a proposal regarding the voting system for the preliminary Japanese peace conference. He stated that all key points of the German peace treaty were first discussed and agreed upon by the major countries such as Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, before they could be established. The Japanese peace treaty could not but pay more attention to the claims of the major controlling countries of Japan, such as China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, although China does not want the use of the veto to affect the success of the peace conference, it also cannot agree to the two-thirds simple voting system proposed by the United States. However, China's proposal is not the generally rumored "two-thirds, including three of the four powers" approval, but "two-thirds, including a majority of the major Allied powers who attend and vote" approval. Yeh concluded by saying that this voting system is only a suggestion for the preliminary meeting of the Japanese peace treaty, and is not China's position when discussing the use of the veto in the Second United Nations General Assembly.

### Foreign Businesses Largely Dissatisfied with High Prices of Japanese Goods, Japanese Finance Minister Studies Yen Exchange Rate

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Although Japan's foreign trade was opened on August 15th, actual transactions began on September 1st. At present, only contracts are being signed. According to news from the trading industry, the goods traded are canned fish and fruit, ceramics, groceries (bamboo ware, etc.), pearls, and leather products. However, foreign commercial representatives who have arrived in Japan have stated that the prices of various goods are too high, and because the exchange rate of the yen has not yet been determined, even if there are goods they want to buy, they do not know how much to buy, so there is no way to negotiate.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] The exchange rate of the yen against foreign currencies has not yet been officially determined, which is inconvenient for both Japanese and foreign business representatives. Finance Minister Kurisu stated after the cabinet meeting yesterday that it is not yet possible to say whether the exchange rate between the yen and the US dollar will adopt a single or multiple system. The exchange rate determined this time can be used as a reference. However, before submitting it to the cabinet for discussion, it is still necessary to study Japan's fundamental trade policy with Hiroo Wada, head of the Economic Stabilization Board, and at the same time, a detailed review of the tariff policy is necessary.

### French Bread Ration Reduced

[Report from this newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: The French cabinet decided today that from September 1st, the national bread ration in France will be reduced from 250 grams to 200 grams per person.

### Greek Cabinet Crisis Unresolved

[Report from this newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: US Ambassador to Greece MacVeagh is meeting with Greek Prime Minister-designate Tsaldaris and Liberal Party leader Sophoulis in an attempt to break the deadlock in forming a coalition government.

### Wei Lihuang Will Return Home Soon

[United Press, Detroit, 26th] General Wei Lihuang, who has been studying military affairs in Europe and the United States for ten months, arrived here today with his wife and will take a steamer from here to San Francisco and then return home.

### Disturbances Arise Again in Security Council; Discussion of Anglo-Egyptian Dispute Inconclusive

[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 26th] The Security Council's discussion of the Anglo-Egyptian dispute today remained inconclusive and is scheduled to continue on Thursday, at which time a vote will be held. Disturbances occurred again at today's meeting because the leader of the Egyptian Socialist Party, Korb, and Mo Shou, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who had previously caused trouble at the meeting, had tried to sneak into the gallery three times today. United Nations security guards ordered the two to leave, but they refused to obey. The guards then tried to arrest them, causing chaos.

The demonstrators resisted strongly, shouting slogans such as "We want independence!" "Down with the Security Council!" "Down with imperialism!" One of the guards was bitten on the left hand. Finally, the two were pushed into a police car and taken to downtown New York City for release. The only motion before the Security Council today was the one proposed by Brazil, calling for Britain and Egypt to resume direct negotiations. This motion was opposed by Egyptian representative Nokrashy. Nokrashy demanded that British troops immediately withdraw from the Nile region and terminate the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan's administration. Britain accepted the Brazilian proposal, but because it is one of the parties to the dispute, it has no voting rights. The outcome depends on whether the Soviet representative exercises the veto and whether Colombia supports the proposal.

### United Nations General Assembly Opens Next Month, Foreign Minister Wang to Attend in Person, Security Council Discusses Veto Power Today

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Vice Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao announced today that the Second United Nations General Assembly will open in New York on September 16. The candidates for the Chinese delegation have been decided: Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh will serve as the chief representative, assisted by Gu Weijun, Jiang Tingfu, Zhang Pengchun, and Liu Kai. The selection of advisors and secretaries will be announced later. However, due to China's current foreign exchange difficulties, some personnel will be recruited overseas to participate in the work. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received notification of the General Assembly's agenda, the most important of which is "Amendment of the Method of Using the Veto." China has been studying and preparing for various issues. As for China's position and policy in the meeting, it will remain the same as those expressed in the previous General Assembly and previous Security Council meetings.

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: United Nations Secretary-General Lie stated today that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will lead the British delegation to attend the next United Nations General Assembly.

[Reuters, Chenggong Lake, 26th] It is learned that the United Nations Security Council will convene a special meeting on Thursday to discuss the entire issue of the use of the veto power by the major powers. It is expected that this discussion will focus on the resolution on the veto power passed by the previous United Nations General Assembly, which urged the five powers to do their best to ensure that the exercise of this privilege of permanent members does not hinder the Security Council from quickly reaching a resolution. In addition, it also recommended that the Security Council adopt methods sufficient to ensure that it exercises its functions quickly and effectively. To date, the major powers of the Security Council have used the veto power a total of twenty times, of which the Soviet Union has used it alone eighteen times. The Soviet Union and France jointly used the veto power once on the Spanish question, and recently France used the veto power alone on the Indonesian question.

### Respecting Teachers and Worshiping Confucius: Grand Ceremony Held at Confucius Temple, Six Hundred Teachers Awarded Certificates of Merit, Mayor and Speaker Elaborate on Importance of Respecting Teachers

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was Confucius' birthday, and the grand ceremony to worship Confucius was held at the Confucius Temple in Nanshi at 8:00 AM yesterday. The hall was set up in the Dacheng Hall of the Confucius Temple, with six palace lanterns hanging under the eaves and white bronze sacrificial utensils placed on the offering platform. Tall red celebratory candles and longevity incense were lit. Behind the incense and candles, fresh flowers and vegetarian fruits were displayed. At the beginning of the ceremony, ancient music was played, and the bells and drums sounded together for a moment, with smoke and incense swirling around, creating an extremely solemn and respectful atmosphere.

The entire assembly bowed three times in the most respectful manner to the spirit tablet of the First Teacher. After the ceremony, the entire assembly withdrew to the sound of music and took a group photo in the Confucius Temple Park.

### Teachers' Day Celebration

Yesterday was also Teachers' Day. Various circles in the city held a celebration meeting at the City Gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road at 10:00 AM, attended by nearly a thousand people, including heads of agencies, dignitaries, guests, and teachers. Red, blue, and white satin curtains and the national flag and Sun Yat-sen's portrait were hung in the hall. On both sides were large brown characters "Respect Teachers and Value the Way," creating a solemn atmosphere. After the presidium, consisting of Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Yan Zhuang, Fang Zhi, Xi Yushu, Cao Jun, Qian Jianqiu, Li Ximou, Tong Hangbai, and Fu Tongxian, led the assembly in performing the ceremonial rites, Mayor Wu delivered the opening remarks, stating that "today's meeting" is to celebrate Teachers' Day and to commemorate the birthday of Confucius. Confucius is the teacher of all ages, and his doctrines have been spread in China for more than two thousand years, serving as the spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation, and is respected by all throughout the ages. Today's society is chaotic, and the country is not at peace, which is due to moral decay, the loss of etiquette and righteousness. Students can arbitrarily strike and even beat teachers. Where is the respect for teachers? Where does the spirit of democracy and the rule of law come from? Therefore, when we commemorate the First Teacher and respect the way of the teacher, we should emulate the spirit of Confucius, strictly adhere to etiquette and righteousness, adhere to etiquette and there will be laws and regulations, adhere to righteousness and there will be no corruption. Shanghai is the center of our country. If you can work together to expose corruption and establish a strict legal system, you will be able to foster a good atmosphere and transform the bad atmosphere of the country.

### Mayor's Two Hopes

Finally, I hope you all two things: (1) Follow the spirit of Confucius, practice what you preach, and be a role model for students. (2) Strictly adhere to your positions with a dauntless spirit and supervise society, then there is hope for a new Shanghai. The future of the new China is bright. Vice Director Li then reported on the primary and secondary school teachers in the city who have served for a long time and have outstanding achievements. According to the Ministry of Education's reward regulations, a total of 642 teachers should be awarded "Wisdom," "Benevolence," and "Courage" certificates: 156 people with more than 20 years of service should receive "Wisdom" certificates, including 76 from secondary schools, 45 from municipal elementary schools, and 35 from private elementary schools. 226 people with more than 15 years of service should receive "Benevolence" certificates, including 82 from secondary schools, 73 from municipal elementary schools, and 71 from private elementary schools. 260 people with more than 10 years of service should receive "Courage" certificates, including 112 from secondary schools, 82 from municipal elementary schools, and 66 from private elementary schools. A total of six hundred and forty-two people in the city. Mayor Wu presented the awards amidst melodious music, and representatives from various schools received the awards. Mayor Wu also paid tribute to all the hard-working teachers in the city.

### Speaker Sympathizes with Teachers' Treatment

Following the awards, Speaker Pan delivered a speech, saying: "Having just heard Mayor Wu promote respect for teachers and seeing the hard-working teachers receive awards, while admiring the teachers who are poor but self-sustaining and strictly adhere to their positions, I cannot help but feel a myriad of emotions. I deeply feel that the way of the teacher is not respected today. The meager treatment of teachers is the same in both public and private schools. Social and economic decline, and parents and members of society are unable to help. It is very ashamed. Fortunately, although there is little material assistance, the respect and faith in teachers in spirit has always been unwavering. However, in the communist areas, this spirit has been destroyed without leaving anything behind. The communist side has even organized children of the age subject to discipline into patrol teams to interfere with teachers, which is absurd. A newspaper slogan wrote: "Confucius said: Poor children cannot be taught." This is a slander against Confucius, the teacher of all ages. Confucius had three thousand disciples, and the foremost of his seventy-two sages was Yan Hui. Yan Hui was poor but did not change his joy, and Confucius praised him highly. Confucius said, "Education should be provided without discrimination." All talents who can be cultivated are educated. The way of Confucius is "investigating things, extending knowledge, rectifying the mind, making intentions sincere, cultivating the self, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world." In the chapter "Manifesting Bright Virtue," there is even more full expression, and "stopping at perfect goodness" is the ultimate goal of life service. If we serve society and seek to "stop at perfect goodness," we must first start with promoting the spirit of respecting teachers. Gradually change the social atmosphere and then govern the country and bring peace to the world.

After Pan's speech, Inspector Yan, Chairman Fang, Tong Chuantong, and parent representative Xi Yushu and others gave speeches one after another, with many encouraging words, which moved the listeners. At the end, they sang the "Respect Teacher Song," and the Datong Music Society performed the entertainment before the meeting adjourned.

### "Eye-Gouging Gang" Should Investigate the Source of Rumors, A Startled Reaction, Several Disturbing Incidents Occur in a Single Day, Thousands Gather on Changning Road, Order Once Greatly Disrupted

[Report from this newspaper] Recently, rumors about the "Eye-Gouging Gang" have become increasingly prevalent, causing a startled reaction and fear. At around 8:40 PM last night, residents near Xinjiekou, at the intersection of Changning Road and Kaixuan Road in West Shanghai, rumored that an incident involving the "Eye-Gouging Gang" had been discovered. In an instant, men and women in the vicinity gathered in increasing numbers, reaching more than a thousand, causing disorder, traffic congestion, and even leading to a tragedy. A man named Yang Yinqiao from Wuzhen, who had arrived in Shanghai with his wife, Wu, just three days ago, was passing by the area when, for some unknown reason, he was falsely accused by some troublemakers of being a "child-snatching gang" or an "eye-gouging gang." Without asking for the reason, they surrounded and beat him, causing him to be injured in the head, with a wound about two centimeters wide, bleeding profusely, with a laceration on his left forehead, and bleeding from his right ear. He fainted on the spot, and his injuries were serious. Wu was also seriously injured.

The nearby police officers were unable to maintain order at the time and reported to the Changning Police Sub-Bureau. After receiving the report, Sub-Bureau Chief Shao personally led Section Chief Xu, Inspector Zhao, and all the judicial police officers to the scene. First, they arrested the perpetrators Chen Changshou, Qin Yiqing, and the five people who spread the rumors, Tang Changfa, Sheng Huangmao, Gao Wenlin, etc., and took them to the bureau for interrogation. Order was gradually restored. On the other hand, the injured men and women were rushed to Ren'ai Hospital for treatment. It is said that Yang's life is in danger. However, when the criminals were taken to the sub-bureau, the general public followed them, and the situation became very serious. A large number of armed police officers were dispatched to disperse them, and the matter was resolved. Subsequently, the sub-bureau continued to send a large number of plainclothes police officers to the shantytowns of West Xinjie to investigate the truth in order to verify the matter.

At a certain house number on Sipailou in the city, at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a thief, Lin Asan (42 years old, residing at 186 Sanpailou), attempted to break into a house in broad daylight. He was spotted and falsely accused of being a "child-snatching gang." A shout went up, and people chased after him, surrounding and beating him. When the police arrived, they arrested one of the perpetrators, Zhu Shiling, and took him to the Yimiao Sub-Bureau for verification.

At around 12:00 AM last night, a pedestrian, Yu Jinda, wearing a white undershirt and shorts, was mistaken for a "child-snatching gang" on Fanhhuangdu Road in West Shanghai and was beaten by many people. Onlookers crowded the scene. Later, when the police arrived, they arrested the three perpetrators, Dan Xiaozi, Lu Fengshan, and Dan Guoxi, on the spot and took them to the bureau for interrogation. They admitted to committing the assault without hesitation. The injured were sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Launching Entertainment Performances to Comfort Passing-Through New Recruits

The Shanghai Municipal All Circles Reception Committee for Comforting Passing-Through Soldiers, yesterday continued its enthusiastic comforting work.

Then the entertainment performance began. The departing soldiers at the China Merchants Bureau warehouse gathered on the platform, where Deputy General Team Leader Liu delivered a comforting speech, with many words of encouragement, followed by the start of the entertainment. Due to the temporary installation of broadcasting equipment, the sound was clear. Although it was an open-air performance, the morale of the officers and soldiers was very high.

It is said that two teams will be sent to the Jiangwan and Wusong barracks today to provide comfort.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Hangzhou Station Porter Forcibly Replaced by New Recruit Unit; Commander Fu is Dispatching Personnel to Investigate and Handle the Matter Strictly

The 10th Company of the 2nd Battalion of New Recruits from the Xuan City District, while transporting soldiers, passed through Nanjing and forcibly pulled Zhang Zhi-gang, a porter from the Hangzhou Station of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, to fill a vacancy, and he was subjected to abuse by Company Commander Chen and Squad Leader of the 7th Squad. After the unit arrived in Shanghai, Commander Fu of the Shanghai Garrison District learned of this and immediately dispatched military judges and medical officers to examine Zhang. The examination revealed that Zhang Zhi-gang did indeed have several wounds on his left arm, with red and swollen skin. In addition to filling out a wound report for record, and keeping him at the Shanghai Garrison Command for treatment, the Hangzhou Station has been notified to investigate and send someone to retrieve him. As for the main culprits, Company Commander Chen and others, they have already left Shanghai with the troops, making it impossible to detain them. The Shanghai Garrison Command has specially reported the case to the Ministry of National Defense for strict punishment.

### Authorities Actively Investigating the Xinghua Company's Coal Hoarding Case

[Our Newspaper News] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau previously seized approximately a thousand tons of stockpiled Hongji white coal dust at Xinghua Fuel Company, No. 104 Xiguangfu Road. After summoning Zhang Zhu-yun, the person in charge of the company, it was reported that this stockpile was allocated by the Fuel Management Committee to the Shanghai Port Command, and entrusted by the Command to be stored at the company. However, whether this is true is still under investigation. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Mechanized Coal Briquette Industry Association issued a statement saying that the fuel company has no business license and has not registered with the association, which clearly indicates that it has other purposes. It is confirmed that it has sold coal. The Association also believes that its claim to be related to a certain organization is also untrue because Hongji white coal dust is produced by the Vietnamese mine, which is the only raw material for making coal briquettes. The Ministry of Economic Affairs specially allocated foreign exchange to purchase and transport it from Vietnam to supply Shanghai's coal briquette raw materials and make coal briquettes for public education personnel and industrial workers. It is the only controlled and prohibited item among white coals, and no organization can illegally buy or sell it. Therefore, the statement by the person in charge of the fuel company that the coal is related to a certain organization is suspected of deliberately creating confusion and misleading the public. It also stated that the person in charge of the fuel company has always been known for being resourceful and flexible, and has been actively seeking assistance in secret since the incident. Since the controlled and prohibited coal secretly flowed into the market, it has caused panic and chaos in the market. All members of the association were extremely indignant upon hearing the news and firmly requested that a thorough investigation be submitted to the relevant authorities to clarify the truth. It is reported that the relevant authorities have received confidential reports and are actively investigating. Relevant departments and associations in Nanjing have also reportedly sent personnel to thoroughly investigate, in order to bring the whole case to light.

### Qi Dong Bandit Army Murder Case; Huang Xing Indicted

[Our Newspaper News] Huang Xing from Qidong was indicted for murder. The original indictment stated that the defendant Huang Xing once served in the New Fourth Army, a bandit army, in Qidong. In early last year, he led bandits to capture the victim, Xing Fengming, in Lingdian Town, Haimen. After a public trial on March 20, he killed him. On August 6 of this year, the defendant was in Shanghai, and the victim's father, the plaintiff Xing Zhengpeng, along with Shen Chao-ran, Yang Zheng-feng, and others, learned of this and arrested him. According to the interrogation, the defendant Huang Xing has already admitted that he was a tax collector for the bandit army's Goods Management Bureau and that he recently met Bai Wenxiu, a member of the bandit army's Women's Resistance Association, at the Xujiahui Station in Shanghai. However, he denied the fact of killing Xing Fengming, claiming that it was the militia captain Tang Zhi-xiang who killed him. He also said that he only saw Xing Fengming once when he was arrested, which shows that the defendant was significantly involved in Xing Fengming's arrest and murder. Furthermore, the witness Zhang Zhenhuan testified that he was taken away by Huang Xing last year, and at that time, Xing Fengming was already there. He learned that Xing Fengming was arrested in Lingdian Town. He witnessed the public trial on March 20th. Initially, the people requested bail, but Huang Xing said that Xing was a national soldier, so the crowd dared not speak. At about 3 p.m. that afternoon, Huang Xing stabbed Xing Fengming in the waist, and other militiamen stabbed him randomly, killing Xing. The testimony is vivid and detailed, proving that the defendant is significantly suspected of killing Xing Fengming, which constitutes a crime under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. A public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Tragedy at Sino-American Hospital; Patient Commits Suicide by Jumping from Building

[Our Newspaper News] At around 5:30 a.m. yesterday, a female patient, Wu Li, a 32-year-old from Hubei, committed suicide by jumping from bed No. 7 in Ward 301 (B) on the third floor of the Sino-American Hospital on Fengyang Road, and died at the scene. The woman originally resided in her hometown. Her husband, Wu Jingbo, died of illness in 1943. They had a daughter, who died young. Later, they adopted Wu Yongfu as their heir, relying on her husband's inheritance to make a living. Last autumn, Wu Li came to Shanghai from her hometown to escape the harassment of the bandit army, staying at her younger brother Li Huaming's residence at No. 3 Fushen Lane, Beihai Road. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, at 6:30 p.m., she accidentally spilled boiling water, causing severe burns to her upper body. Her younger brother, Li Shengkui, and cousin, Xu Houzhai, sent her to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment, which has not healed to this day. Feeling hopeless about her life and despairing because her injuries were not healing quickly, she became pessimistic. Yesterday morning, she took advantage of the lack of attention and jumped from the balcony on the third floor, suffering head injuries and bleeding from her nose, and died. The body has now been sent to the autopsy institute. The Xin Cheng Police Station is sending personnel to investigate.

### Jiangsu Flood Relief Committee to Hold Inaugural Meeting Today

### Vast Area of Roads Awaiting Repair; Estimated Cost Reaches Two Hundred Million; Repairs May Take Five Years to Complete

[Our Newspaper News] According to the most accurate statistics from the Public Works Bureau, repairing one square meter of road costs 100,000 yuan. The total road area in the city reaches 7.5 million square meters. When the Public Works Bureau took over, the city had over 3 million square meters of road surfaces that were damaged and in urgent need of repair. As of the end of June this year, 1.8 million square meters have been repaired, but there are still 2 million square meters awaiting repair, with repair costs reaching 200 billion yuan. Given the city government's current economic difficulties, it is estimated that it will take five consecutive years to complete the repair of the city's damaged roads. In addition, the volume of traffic on the city's roads has increased sharply after the war. Heavy vehicles such as ten-wheeled trucks, sports cars, large trailers, and even landing craft are all driving in the urban area, causing severe damage even to road surfaces that were originally in good condition. Because the durability of asphalt road surfaces is at most ten years, the Public Works Bureau will find it difficult to cope with the continuous periodic destruction of road surfaces. According to Zhao Zu-kang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, during this difficult transition period, the Bureau can only do its best to supervise its employees and make every effort. As for the goals of future new road construction projects, two have been decided: (1) to widen roads and strengthen Shanghai's transportation connections by land, sea, and air, and (2) to increase the city's north-south traffic capacity to eliminate the remnants of the past division between the "Chinese area" and the "Concession." The overall planning and expansion of the road system will be coordinated with the Greater Shanghai urban plan as the ultimate goal.

At around 9 a.m. yesterday, he reported to the Huangpu Police Bureau that after closing the shop at approximately 7:10 p.m. the previous night, all Chinese and Western employees had left, leaving only the elderly caretaker Xu Shi-gao. Suddenly, two uninvited guests arrived, attempting to steal. Because Xu was guarding, it was not easy to succeed. They punched him repeatedly, causing him to faint to the ground.

[Our Newspaper News] The 44 employees of the mud bridge DaGuanYuan bathhouse who were arrested by the Xin Cheng Police Sub-Bureau on the 21st of this month for vandalizing the bathhouse have all been released on bail because the bathhouse manager, Yang Shaoyun, did not want to pursue the matter. At the same time, the labor dispute that had been deadlocked for ten days at the Western District Bathhouse, a member of the industry association, has also been resolved smoothly as a result.

### Tax Official Corruption Case; Direct Tax Administration Conducting Thorough Investigation, Sends Inspectors to Shanghai; Extensive Investigation of Shanghai Tax Bureau; Fourteen Suspected Tax Officials Released on Bail

[Our Newspaper News] The Ministry of Finance's Direct Tax Administration yesterday sent Inspector Zuo Lianzhong to Shanghai to investigate the case of corruption by inspectors at the Shanghai Municipal Direct Tax Bureau. After arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing at noon, Inspector Zuo visited various tax authorities. At around 6 p.m., he visited Zhang Zhongyuan at the Daguan Garden Commercial Center at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Mahuo Road. Zhang was out, so the director of general affairs of the commercial center, Zai Shengxiao, received him and truthfully reported the situation of extortion and corruption by the Shanghai Municipal Direct Tax Bureau inspectors.

Inspector Zuo told reporters that his mission was not limited to the case of the Chinese-style furniture store being victimized; he would also conduct an extensive investigation into all aspects of the city's tax bureau. He also said that if tax officials were indeed extorting money, they would be in violation of the anti-corruption regulations and should be transferred to the court for trial, where they would be severely punished. As for the supervisory personnel, they could not evade the responsibility of dereliction of duty and should also bear corresponding responsibility. Director Lou Guowei said that the 14 suspects in the case have all been released on bail, and the tax bureau employees also have guarantors, so there is no risk of them absconding. He is now waiting for the central government to investigate. Since the implementation of the auditing system, there have been many cases of dereliction of duty and corruption by employees, either detected by the bureau or reported by businesses and the public. Those with solid evidence have been transferred to the court for punishment according to law, he said.

Mayor Wu Hosts Teachers in the Three Principles of the People Youth League Garden (Photo by Our Newspaper)

### Century of Cultivation; Teachers Recognized with Garden Party as Modest Token of Respect

At 5:30 p.m., Mayor Wu hosted 600 outstanding teachers with long service at the garden of the Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League on Zhongzheng South Second Road, and awarded them Teacher Appreciation Medals.

Mayor Wu said that he should have visited each of the hardworking and meritorious teachers to pay his respects, and according to ancient etiquette, he should have hosted a grand banquet, but due to time constraints, he could only prepare a modest snack today to show his respect, for which he was very sorry. After Mayor Wu finished speaking, Li Xian-zhang, a teacher from Jin Yi Yuan Middle School, and Hu Huai-tian, chairman of the Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Association, gave speeches of thanks. Speaker Pan was then invited to speak, saying: At a time when life is difficult and prices are high, teachers have been working hard on their educational posts, some for ten years, twenty years, or even thirty years. You have been working hard all these years, and the outside world does not know your hardships. Today, the mayor is hosting you, representing the citizens of the city, to express his condolences and respect. I believe you must feel happy in your hearts.

His eldest son, Qianjin (25 years old), earns a living by pulling a rickshaw. Because Shan's son was excessively doted on when he was young, he is violent.

Unexpectedly, Qianjin threatened his father with an axe. Fortunately, neighbors seized the axe. The nearby police then arrested Shan's son and took him to the Songshan Road Police Station, transferring him to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning.

### Two Stories from the Telecommunications Bureau; Illustrating the Importance of the Telecommunications Industry and Helping People Understand the Hardships of Employees

(Special Article by Our Newspaper) The mission of telecommunications is as important as the nerves in the human body. Therefore, telecommunications agencies are often compared to the nervous system of a city or a country. China after the Great War has suffered a serious illness. Post-illness recovery and a healthy nervous system are of course one of the most important tasks. The innovation and progress of Shanghai's telecommunications business in the past year have indeed achieved remarkable results, but it is still too far from ideal perfection because there are not enough materials and not enough funds. In the face of these material shortcomings, the Telecommunications Bureau has tried its best to compensate with manpower. Therefore, the Telecommunications Bureau does not have a half-day holiday or shortened office hours like other agencies in the summer. They still work in shifts around the clock, desperately improving work efficiency and making every effort to adopt new facilities, such as telex, wireless express delivery, limited-time delivery, work competitions, and telecommunications Q&A. In particular, the male and female employees in the business offices of the Telecommunications Bureau, wearing uniform youth attire or dark blue shirts and skirts, have left a good impression on the citizens with their humble and thoughtful service spirit. However, there are hundreds or thousands more behind the scenes, the telegraph operators and telephone operators whom we do not usually see are also working hard.

Miss Lucy's Gift Certificate

Miss Lucy of the business office - she did not want to reveal her real name, and asked me to call her that. She told the reporter: We sit here all day, even on Sundays. We have integrated work and life. If we can find interest in life, why not in work? This is a comforting thing, she said, "One early morning, prices rose again, and people sending telegrams flocked in, arguing and shouting, filling the business office to the brim. I found an old man with white hair, carrying a large bag, sweating and panting, never able to get to the front. When I saw him, I was suddenly driven by compassion and accepted his telegram first. He thanked me repeatedly, paid the telegram fee, and left. The next day, I sat at the counter window to receive telegrams as usual. After a busy period, I suddenly found a pink gift certificate with gold lettering with my name on it beside my hand."

Finally Returning the Improper Reward

Miss Lucy paused and added, "The counter windows where we sit have the names of the employees on duty." She continued, "I opened it and saw a 100,000 yuan gift certificate, along with a small note:"

"Miss: We are very grateful to you for accepting our telegram ahead of schedule yesterday, which allowed the telegram to arrive two hours later that day, thus avoiding a huge loss for us. ×× Bank Manager ×××." "I cannot accept this improper reward. Finally, I handed it over to the director to return it, but my heart was deeply comforted."

Long-distance telephone is "live communication," which is more difficult to handle than telegrams. Most users who use long-distance telephones have impatient and anxious feelings, but due to the limitations of lines and climate, it is sometimes not possible to connect smoothly. Users repeatedly inquire.

Stern Reprimand Converted to Gentle Apology

One afternoon, a user with telephone number 16532 in this city requested an urgent Qingdao long-distance call. In a moment, the Qingdao line was connected, but when it was connected to him, all he heard was a continuous "busy signal" - (indicating that the other party's telephone was in use). Once, twice, three times, it was the same. Unexpectedly, his inquiry bell rang, and a rude and stern question came from the telephone. The operator almost cried because of his scolding. The section chief personally came over to explain to him and told him to hang up the telephone and wait for a reply. In a few minutes, the Qingdao line was connected again. After the operator dialed 16532 several times, she came over to report to the section chief that the other party's telephone was again "busy." The section chief asked her to bear with it and continue to provide faithful service. Once, twice, up to seven times, the rude voice appeared again on the telephone. This time it was different. He was moved by the gentle tone and explained apologetically: "I'm sorry, my telephone is too busy."

The above two stories are just a small episode in their years of work. We can understand more deeply from these two stories the importance of the telecommunications industry in a city and also tell us how hard the telecommunications employees are working to serve the citizens.

### After the Communist Bandits' Rout in Shandong, They Fled Across the Yellow River; Most Either Drowned or Were Annihilated; National Forces Pursued in Victory

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 24th] Recently, the Communist bandits in the southwestern Lu area, around Zou County, deployed a force of up to twelve columns, numbering over 200,000 men. Their intention was clearly to seize Jining, Zou County, Yanzhou, and Jining, and then directly threaten and encircle Xuzhou. Therefore, they did not hesitate to move far from, and even abandon, their Yimeng Mountain base area to fight the National Army. At this point, the war has reached its climax.

Because Teng County, Zou County, Yanzhou, and Jining are all on the railway line, and are in close proximity to Xuzhou, the National Army's command and supply center, the National Army has an absolute advantage in terms of replenishment of food and ammunition, as well as troop deployment and utilization. In addition, the southwestern Shandong plain is an ideal location for the National Army's mechanized units to exert their combat power. On the other hand, the bandit army does not have the National Army's logistics supply system. They usually rely entirely on warehouse supplies. Now that they have moved far from and abandoned their base in the mountains, it is tantamount to abandoning their warehouses. It is already difficult for such a large force to rely entirely on requisitioning grain from the local people. Moreover, they also lack the ammunition and equipment that the people cannot provide. Therefore, it is obvious that the war cannot be sustained, and Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng are bound to suffer a disastrous defeat. Due to his error in choosing the battlefield, his defeat was already predetermined by objective conditions.

By July 18, Chen Yi's troops, having suffered heavy casualties, had no choice but to retreat first. Among them, the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 8th columns fled west across the railway, merging with Liu Bocheng's forces. Initially, they passed through Ningyang and Wenshang, fleeing north across the Dawen River. Because Wang Yaowu's troops occupied Tai'an for the third time on July 14 and then moved south, the north bank of the Wen River was heavily guarded like an iron wall. Having failed to flee north, they had no choice but to cross the Grand Canal and struggle around Yuncheng and Liangshan Village with Liu's bandit remnants. Another force, the 2nd, 3rd, and 9th columns, fled east through Liangqiu, infiltrating north into the eastern mountainous area. Realizing the importance of the base area, the 8th, 10th, and Rapid Columns, originally stationed there, launched a counterattack on Nanma on July 19.

They attacked for three days, but not only failed to capture it, but also suffered losses of around 30,000 men. Moreover, Linqu, the only strategic point on their rear route, was captured by Li Mi's troops from Weinan, under the National Army, on July 22. The bandits, facing enemies on both sides and believing that Li's troops were weak, abandoned Nanma again and gathered the remnants who fled north from Liangqiu, a total of six columns, to besiege Linqu. However, Li's troops were determined and relied on three-dimensional supplies and bombing. By July 31, the National Army's reinforcements from the north and south arrived at the designated locations as scheduled, under the orders of the highest authorities. At this point, Chen Yi had no choice but to flee in different directions. As of the time this dispatch was written, except for the 7th Column, which was still entrenched in Zhucheng, and the 9th Column, which was located southwest of Pingdu at Tingkou, the remaining regular troops had all fled north of the Yellow River. The National Army launched an offensive on August 14 to clear the Jiaoji Railway's Jinan-Weifang section and the Zhangbo branch line. It was originally planned to be cleared in one week, but it was successfully completed on August 19 (two days ahead of schedule). Because the National Army's encirclement was tightening, Chen Yi's four remaining columns in southwestern Shandong faced the threat of

Total Annihilation

They were forced to retreat, and under the cover of Liu's bandit remnants, they abandoned Liangshan Village on the night of August 11 and fled across the Yellow River from villages and towns such as Shilitang, at the intersection of the Yellow River and the Grand Canal. However, after being tracked and pursued by the National Army and bombed by the air force throughout the night, only seven or eight thousand of these bandit remnants were able to cross the river. The rest either drowned or were annihilated. Liu Bocheng's remnants, seeing this, in order to avoid heavy sacrifices, broke through the Longhai Railway and fled through Xincai in the border area between Henan and Anhui towards the Tongbai Mountain area in the border area between Henan and Hubei. Currently, there are no regular bandit troops in southwestern Shandong, except for some local teams that remain.

According to military assessments here, Chen Yi's strength has been reduced by at least 70%, and it will take at least two months of reorganization to recover. During this retreat from Zibo, even the Dongjiang Detachment, which was transported to Shandong from Guangdong last year, was expanded into the Liangguang Column to cover the retreat of Chen Yi's remnants in the Changshan Zhangdian area. The extent of his losses is evident from this. Liu Bocheng's losses are at least one-third or more. The Communist bandit Xinhua News Agency recently broadcasted that it had frankly admitted the failure in the Shandong campaign. According to young people who escaped from the bandit area, the Communist bandits have recently dug the trenches of class struggle deeper and wider in their "liberated areas," making the blood feuds in the world deeper and deeper. Almost all of the able-bodied young men in the so-called areas that the Communist bandits are about to leave have been coerced away. Therefore, the Communist bandits have exposed a

New Slogan

That is: "Abandon Shandong, but not the mountainous areas; abandon the mountainous areas, but not Yantai; abandon Yantai, but not Qingdao Society."

Now that the vast base area in the Yimeng Mountains has been forced to be abandoned, what remains is only the Laoshan mountain area in the Shandong Peninsula and the Jiaodong Military Region centered on Laiyang. As long as the Shandong Peninsula is thoroughly recovered, and the recovered areas can be thoroughly pacified and suppressed, so that the Communist bandits cannot "turn small fragments into small wholes, and large fragments into large wholes," then the Shandong war can truly come to an end. As for the Lu Bei (northern Shandong) area north of the Yellow River, the terrain is flat for thousands of miles, and it is difficult for the Communist bandits to hold on to it. Therefore, with the resolution of the Shandong battlefield, the Hebei battlefield will also be resolved accordingly. In the near future, the war inside the pass will shift to the Shanxi battlefield as the military center for suppressing bandits. (Special Correspondent Li Tian)

### Yangzhou "Leeches" Unleash Violence, Destroying Three Cars

[Special Dispatch from Yangzhou, 24th] The Liuxu automobile wharf on the riverside of this county has always been a place where "leeches" are active. The local authorities have repeatedly banned them, but to no avail. This morning (24th) at about 6:00 AM, a group of more than 100 "leeches" suddenly gathered, each holding iron tools and bricks, and destroyed three cars of the Yang Qing Long-Distance Bus Company, numbers 401, 402, and 106, as well as the company's office building. They also snatched many tires and repair tools, and several employees were severely beaten. After receiving the news, the Fifth District Commissioner's Office and the Police Bureau dispatched police officers to the scene to suppress the "leeches," who then dispersed. The company and the Automobile Workers' Union are now submitting reports to various agencies, requesting a thorough investigation. Commissioner Lin and County Magistrate Wang personally went to inspect and mediate.

### Opening of Trade Between Hong Kong and Japan

They will depart in early September and will stay in Japan for a limited time of three weeks. There are still sixty other trading companies in Hong Kong that have applied to go to Japan. After the first batch of representatives returns, another ten representatives will be approved to go. Trade between Hong Kong and Japan can be said to be officially open. Four of the ten trading companies are Indian trading companies, known for specializing in silk and fabrics.

Consumption of Tobacco and Alcohol

The Hong Kong Import and Export Department released statistics for July, which show that tobacco and alcohol accounted for a considerable number. The import of tobacco was worth HK$1,824,729, and the export was HK$993,891. The import of alcohol was worth HK$872,279, and the export was HK$603,791.

People Are Not As Good As Dogs

There are more than 100 purebred foreign dogs in Hong Kong, each worth about HK$400-500, most of which are imported from Australia or the United Kingdom and the United States. Mr. Howell, a Briton who was the secretary of the "China Kennel Club" in Shanghai and a member of the London Kennel Club, is now planning to organize a Hong Kong Kennel Club and plans to hold a dog show next spring. The Hong Kong Government Medical Department recently announced that the monthly food cost for foreign dogs is HK$75, while the minimum monthly living cost for workers is only HK$57.67, which truly makes people think that "people are not as good as dogs"!

The Governor's Whereabouts

Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Grantham, is scheduled to visit Guangzhou on the 27th of this month, making his first visit to General Zhang Fakui, Director of the Guangzhou Xing Yuan (branch of the Nationalist government in Guangzhou), and General Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of Guangdong Province, after taking office. It is said that the Governor also plans to fly to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang. This trip will have a great impact on the future of Sino-British relations, without a doubt. Sir Grantham, formerly named Sir Alexander Grantham, learned Cantonese from Huang Huaqing, a well-known scholar in Guangzhou, when he served at the British Consulate in Guangzhou, and he also practiced calligraphy, achieving considerable success.

The Monk Xu Yun

The 101-year-old monk Xu Yun arrived in Hong Kong from Guangdong on the 19th to preside over the Wanshan Yuan Shenghui (a grand Buddhist ceremony), bringing with him 46 monks from the Nanhua and Yunmen monasteries to assist in the ceremonies, which was a grand occasion for a time. The Hong Kong Secretary for Chinese Affairs personally went to the Wanshan Yuan Shenghui on the 23rd to "cut the ribbon," lit firecrackers with a lighter, and was led by the old monk Xu Yun to visit and explain the meaning of the eighteen levels of hell according to the diagrams. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs repeatedly replied: "Yes, yes."

Land Prices Rise

Recently, land prices in Hong Kong have risen because more and more wealthy people from mainland China have come to Hong Kong and are competing to buy land. Whenever public land is auctioned, the final bid is often more than ten times higher than the reserve price. General scenic areas, such as the Peak District, Repulse Bay, and Stanley, whether they are plots of land or dilapidated houses, are being snapped up. The original Chinese and Western pawnshops in Hong Kong are no match for them. Recently, a vacant lot in Deep Water Bay, with a reserve price of only HK$0.30 per square foot, was sold for HK$3. A section of land in Kowloon City was sold for HK$2 per square foot, but its reserve price was only HK$0.10.

Two Factions of Chinese Businessmen

Recently, the general famous merchants and tycoons in Hong Kong are more enthusiastic about the election of the Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce than about the election of National Assembly representatives (two) and Legislative Council members (one). This shows that Hong Kong businessmen are more interested in economics than in politics. The members of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce are currently clearly divided into two factions: a "conservative" faction and a "progressive" faction, forming an opposition. The former believes that Hong Kong is a special zone, and things should be done with caution, always seeking to avoid mistakes, which is considered success. The latter believes that times have changed, and if they do not keep up with the times and resolutely innovate, the status of overseas Chinese businessmen will become even lower. In the past, when the Hong Kong government suggested introducing income tax, the latter formed an association to oppose it, with strong emotions, but failed due to the former's "weakness and adherence to old ways." The former is an emerging force, while the latter has a solid foundation. It is still difficult to tell who will win in the future. (Special Correspondent Zi Jian)

### Three Monks of Songyin Temple Willing to Abandon Fish Drums and Join the Army

[Dispatch from Jinshan, 25th] The Songyin Pagoda Temple in this county is a famous historical site in Jinshan and one of the few ancient Zen monasteries in Punan.

[Dispatch from Jiaxing, 26th] Recently, a case of illegal felling of mulberry trees and indiscriminate arrest of villagers by soldiers of the Joint Logistics Department warehouse guard camp in Zhenru Township, this county, has been a major topic of discussion. The people of the entire township claim that thousands of trees have been felled, resulting in significant losses. Moreover, this time, the camp condoned the illegal soldiers without punishing them, but instead arrested three people, privately detaining them for 30 hours without releasing them, and abused them, treating the lives of the people like dirt. Therefore, representatives were elected at 5:00 PM on the 25th to petition various agencies. Local legal groups in this county are extremely concerned about this matter and convened an emergency meeting of all sectors, organized the Jiaxing Zhenru Township Case Support Committee of all sectors, and appointed seven standing committee members. That evening, they sent telegrams to the Minister of National Defense, the Chief of General Staff, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics Department, requesting that the person in charge of the warehouse be immediately ordered to release the three villagers and rural residents who were illegally arrested, and to punish the culprits severely according to military law in order to appease the people.

### Qingdao City to Prepare for the Establishment of a Fish Market, Officially Established at the Beginning of Next Month

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 27th] Jiaozhou Bay is one of the fishing areas in North China. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was devastated by the enemy and puppet regimes, and the fishing industry declined. After the victory, the government attached great importance to this. The reporter recently interviewed the local fisheries authorities on this matter. According to reports, the fishing area of Qingdao extends from the mouth of the Yangtze River in the south to Lanzhou Bay in the north, and reaches Goryeo (Korea) in the east, covering a vast area. Currently, a part of the area is occupied by Communist bandits. Before the war, there were more than 190 fishing vessels here. Now, only more than 80 can be used, and there were more than 3,000 sailing boats, but now there are only more than 1,500. Since January of this year, the fishing vessels have caught more than 13 million catties, and the sailing boats have caught more than 2 million catties. The trading volume of fishing vessels was more than 16 billion yuan, and the trading volume of sailing boats was 1.5 billion yuan. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, exports are very difficult. Currently, they are refrigerated in icehouses or salted by the sea and transported to Shanghai and Tianjin in small quantities, resulting in low fish prices in Qingdao and a difficult life for fishermen. The Qingdao Fish Market Preparatory Office of the Ministry of Agriculture will be officially established at the beginning of next month. Detailed plans have been drawn up for future improvements in the fishing industry.

### Overseas Chinese Merchants from the Philippines Send Representatives to Shanghai

To Negotiate Plans for Sales of Yarn and Cloth in the Philippines, and Propose Four Suggestions for Promoting National Products

[Report from our newspaper] Seven merchants from the Philippines, including Zhonghua, Huadong, Huatong, Shengxing, Nantong, Xinghua, and Zhendong, considering that the sales of national yarn and cloth in the Nanyang market are not as good as before, specially sent representatives to Shanghai to negotiate plans for sales of yarn and cloth in the Philippines with the China Textile Construction Company in order to restore the original position of national yarn and cloth. According to the investigation, the bleached cloth, fine cloth, and other products produced in large quantities by the Textile Construction Company have a good market in the Philippines. Therefore, it is proposed that the Textile Construction Company first hand over the three types of goods, fine cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth, to the seven companies for exclusive agency in the Philippines. It is estimated that the monthly sales volume of the three types of cloth in the Philippines is as follows: (1) Bleached cloth 5,000 to 10,000 bolts, (2) Fine cloth 5,000 to 10,000 bolts, (3) Printed cloth 8,000 to 15,000 bolts, (4) Other 3,000 to 5,000 bolts. In addition, they also proposed four suggestions: (1) The cost of national goods is now more expensive than that of American goods. If the materials are not excellent and the patterns are not novel, it will be difficult to compete with them. (2) The large-scale promotion of national goods cannot rely solely on the labor of the promoters. At the same time, manufacturers must cooperate sincerely and assist with various incentive methods. (3) The Philippines is close to the motherland, so purchasing national goods is faster than American goods. However, it is necessary to be careful not to have a situation where the supply exceeds the demand, so as to avoid sluggish sales and loss-making competition. (4) To eliminate this kind of malpractice, unity is the most important thing. Setting a uniform price can eliminate price cutting, and sales can also be spared from the impact.

The representatives of the overseas Chinese merchants have contacted the authorities of the Textile Construction Company several times. It is heard that they hope that the seven companies will jointly promote sales, but place orders individually. However, the authorities of the Textile Construction Company hope that the seven companies will pool their capital and organize a joint organization to handle the sales of yarn and cloth. The principles of the negotiations between the two parties have been close, and it is hoped that a contract for the sales of yarn and cloth in the Philippines will be signed soon.

### Relevant Parties Reveal Statistics: The Reality of Tung Oil Smuggling in Hong Kong and Macau

[Central News Agency, this city] In order to gain international market position, the government is actively promoting export trade and is sparing no effort to formulate foreign exchange management and import and export trade methods. Since its implementation, the response has been very good. The most obvious results are the reduction of smuggling in South China and the increase in remittances from overseas Chinese, which can achieve the effect of pointing the finger at the arm. However, smuggling in South China has a long history and deep roots. Moreover, the new price of foreign exchange management is still 10% away from the market price. Illegal merchants are only interested in profit. If the control is not strengthened, the old ways will recur, which will inevitably affect the overall situation. According to people with qualifications, the actual situation of tung oil smuggling in South China in the past, and the actual situation of foreign exchange settlement and smuggling statistics in May, June, and July are as follows:

(1) Smuggling situation in Hong Kong. Tung oil smuggling in South China is divided into two types: (A) Formal smuggling by the Cantonese gang, (B) Disguised smuggling by the Hunan gang. The Cantonese gang's smuggling method is to first concentrate the tung oil in Guangzhou, and then transport it in batches to Shiqiao or Taiping in Panyu County, which is under the jurisdiction of the county, and then smuggle it out of Hong Kong through the Da Chan customs with the protection of powerful people. There are three policies for dealing with the customs: buying customs clearance, opening customs clearance, and reaching customs clearance. From January to July, the total monthly export volume was about 2,000 tons.

According to government regulations, Hunan tung oil must complete foreign exchange settlement before being transported south and load the goods with the certificate. However, there are no foreign exchange settlement institutions in Changsha and Hengyang. Merchants use this point to first apply for export with a guaranteed foreign exchange settlement, and then change the name of the firm when they are pursued for foreign exchange settlement in the future to settle the matter. In the first half of the year, this gang came with about 1,000 tons of goods per month. In May, June, and July, it was between 300 and 500 tons.

(2) Smuggling situation in Macau. Since the Hong Kong government announced that it would implement stricter controls on tung oil and tin from July 28, exporters from Shantou would have to settle 25% of the US dollars they earned with the government, which would reduce profits, so they planned to transfer their activities to Macau. However, because it is not an international commercial port, there are many difficulties in loading bulk oil onto ships. It is reported that there is currently no oil storage in the Macau market.

According to statistics, the China Vegetable Oil Factory settles the most foreign exchange for tung oil transported to Hong Kong. Zhixiang, Jinli, Dechengxing, Yuexingxiang, and other companies smuggle tung oil to Hong Kong. The attached statistical table is as follows:

Foreign Exchange Settlement Transported to Hong Kong Smuggling Transported to Hong Kong

### The Rise in Sugar Prices Has Not Stopped

Yesterday, the rise in sugar prices has not stopped. The market was very tight. The association's market price for No. 20 medium sand white spot was 665,000 yuan, up more than 20,000 yuan. The rise in No. 45 white was similar, at 823,000 yuan. The price of Hechi was 750,000 yuan, and the price of straw bags was 730,000 yuan, with little fluctuation, because the prices were already high. Shantou Tiqing was 550,000 yuan, up 20,000 yuan. Cotton red was 640,000 yuan, with a total of hundreds of bags. Bagged Xinghua White was 715,000 yuan to 720,000 yuan, barreled was 685,000 yuan, and Xingchi was 585,000 yuan to 590,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan, with a total of 800 pieces traded. Diaoqing continued to rise by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with about 200 pieces traded at 520,000 yuan to 525,000 yuan.

### Bicycle Manufacturing Plant: Request Prohibition of Japanese Goods Import

[Report from Our Newspaper] Domestic bicycle manufacturers, in order to appeal for a ban on the import of Japanese bicycles, recently hosted members of the press to report on the current state of domestic production, stating that the quantity produced is sufficient to meet domestic demand. In terms of quality, although it may not match British, American, and German goods, compared to enemy Japanese goods, it is only superior to them.

Because the Central Trust Bureau has already imported some vehicles, the manufacturers are deeply concerned that Article 4 of the "Implementation Outline of Measures for Business Delegations to Japan," which limits import and export goods, includes a large number of bicycles in the imported goods category of "transportation equipment and materials." Therefore, they jointly decided to organize a "Joint Petition Delegation of Domestic Bicycle Manufacturers," which will immediately launch petitions to relevant authorities and send telegrams to counterparts across the country, insisting on achieving the goal of stopping the import of these vehicles, in order to ensure the survival of the fledgling national industry and achieve the goal of self-manufacturing, self-sales, and self-sufficiency.

### First Batch of 100 Tons of Taiwan Sugar Shipped to Singapore for Sale

According to a statement from Taiwan Sugar Corporation (Taisugar): In order to compete for the Southeast Asian market, since deciding on the principle of Taisugar exports last month, they have recently shipped one hundred tons of Taiwan sugar from Kaohsiung Port to Singapore for sale. This export of Taisugar is the first export after the war and marks the beginning of re-entering the international market. The company has also prepared a second batch of two hundred tons of sugar for export, ready to be successively shipped to Southeast Asia. This is still of an exploratory nature, and if the situation is good, they plan to develop a long-term sales plan.

### E-Z Cigarette Company Loan: Contract Soon to Be Signed

In order to assist the cigarette industry in purchasing tobacco leaves from production areas to compensate for the reduction in imported tobacco leaves after the foreign exchange quota for the third quarter was reduced, which was insufficient to meet demand, the government authorities have approved the principles of loan requests submitted by cigarette manufacturers in order to maintain cigarette industry production. It is learned that the loan of 25 billion yuan to the foreign-owned E-Z Cigarette Company will be provided through acceptance by four banks – "Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Shiye, Shanghai, and Citibank" – each accepting 6.25 billion yuan, which will be rediscounted to the Central Bank for a term of sixty days at an interest rate of 7.5%. The acceptor is the General Manager of E-Z Cigarette Company, Yong Tai He Cigarette Company. It is heard that the contract will be signed within days so that it can be used before September 15th. As for the 50 billion yuan loan for Chinese cigarette factories, it is said that it has been frozen due to the government's announcement of loan contraction.

### Promoting the Export of Bristles and Tung Oil: Matters Requiring Attention by Exporters: Prices Must First Be Stabilized to Avoid Export Difficulties

Since the revision of the import and export trade measures, merchants dealing in bristles and tung oil, which are major products of our country, have been actively trying to export them. The bristles and tung oil produced and sold by our country have always occupied the most important position in the international market, but during the war, due to the inconvenience of transportation, Europe has begun to use drying linseed oil as a substitute for tung oil. South America and other places have extremely abundant linseed production, which is enough to affect the sales of tung oil in our country.

As for bristles, Poland has recently been actively increasing production and making full use of German bristle factories for production. In the near future, its production may exceed our country and rank first in the world. Taking into account the difficulties of merchants, the government has specifically revised the import and export trade measures to promote exports. The things that bristle and tung oil merchants should currently pay attention to under these circumstances are as follows, according to industry insiders:

(1) Suppress the rising prices of bristles and tung oil. In the past, there was always a profit to be made at the beginning of each foreign exchange adjustment, but later, due to the continuous rise in prices, they fell into difficulties again and could not export. With the lessons of the past, it is imperative to prevent the recurrence of this malpractice, otherwise merchants will be blocking their own path. For the sake of long-term promotion, it is necessary to stabilize its price increases.

(2) Widespread purchasing. The production areas of bristles and tung oil are spread across the villages, but because the production areas are remote, farmers are unable to transport them out, which affects the export quantity and also affects the rural economy. Therefore, when merchants purchase, they must strive for widespread purchasing. In remote areas, seeing that the sales of products are being resold, their interest in production can also be turned into strong interest.

(3) Improve quality. The quality of bristles and tung oil transported and sold in the future must be improved, and they must not contain impurities as before, which affects foreign sales.

In addition, in recent days, due to sluggish prices in the foreign market, very few merchants from various countries have come to China to place orders. Therefore, after the revision of the foreign exchange control measures, there have been no exports to date.

### Automobile Quota Allocation: Car Dealers Request Adjustment

The Municipal Automobile Business Association submitted a request to the Transportation Management Committee yesterday, requesting the following three points: (1) The automobile importers who have passed the review in the past should be strictly reviewed again. The standard is that any business firm that formally engages in automobile trade must have considerable sample rooms and repair departments in the country, and must obtain a license approved by the competent authority. (2) Request adjustment of the automobile import quota allocation benefits to balance actual needs. (3) Before the adjustment of the automobile import quota allocation qualification is completed, the quota for the third quarter of this year will be temporarily suspended. They also requested that when the automobile import quota is allocated in the future, the association be allowed to send personnel to participate and provide opinions.

### Import and Export Joint Company: Two Suggestions to the Authorities: Promote Increased Export of Materials and Import of Raw Materials

The Import and Export Joint Company is actively preparing for its establishment after the promulgation of the new foreign exchange measures. The preparatory office of the company specially convened the second sponsors' meeting a few days ago to discuss stepping up the preparatory work, and decided to send Zhang Huanzhang and others to Beijing again to ask for instructions and discuss everything. It is learned that the company is now making two suggestions to the authorities, requesting the government to adopt them in order to promote the export of materials and increase the import of industrial raw materials. The contents are as follows:

(1) The foreign exchange earned by the company from exports should be kept in the national bank without settlement of prices, and should be used exclusively for offsetting remittances when handling imports. Because the market price of foreign exchange may change daily, to avoid suffering from foreign exchange fluctuations in the import and export process. In short, they do not want to gamble with banks designated to have the power to agree on foreign exchange market prices.

(2) The types of materials imported by the company under import and export control should be subject to restrictions, but not subject to quantity restrictions. Because the insufficient supply of imported industrial raw materials is a common fact today. Now, in order to encourage exports in exchange for urgently needed industrial raw material imports, it should not be given rigid quantity restrictions that are inconsistent with supply and demand. As for those who say that the imported materials may belong to the category of permitted imports, or may not meet actual needs, and waste foreign exchange, in fact, merchants are concerned about their capital, and there is absolutely no such stupid thing. The company intends to ask the government to send personnel to supervise the company's accounting, and is willing to provide a part of the foreign exchange earned from exports to the national treasury for national needs.

### Measures for the Transfer and Handover of the National Treasury Sub-Treasury and Revenue and Expenditure Office

[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank recently revised the "Measures for the Transfer and Handover of National Treasury Sub-Treasury and Revenue and Expenditure Office," which has been communicated to all branches and offices for compliance.

(8) When the agency originally acting as the National Treasury sub-treasury stops acting as an agent, and the sub-treasury cashier accounting it acted as an agent for is changed to the National Treasury revenue and expenditure office cashier accounting, and another agency acts as an agent, the accounts of the original agency sub-treasury shall be closed. The account books, forms, and other documents of previous years shall be transferred together to the agency acting as the National Treasury revenue and expenditure office for safekeeping.

(10) The events handled by the original agent agency during the agency period and the various documents issued before the handover shall be continued to be handled by the new agent agency after acceptance. If it is found that the error occurred during the agency period of the original agent agency, the original agent agency shall be fully responsible.

(11) The business of managing various public bonds and collecting unified donations by the agency originally acting as the National Treasury sub-treasury does not belong to the scope of the entrusted agent treasury business. All outstanding matters of the project and relevant circulars, rules, and public bond samples of public bond donations should not be transferred to the new agent treasury agency. In addition to the fact that the Central Bank should designate the branch office responsible for receiving and keeping it, other agent treasury agencies shall handle it in accordance with the instructions of their superior agencies.

(12) The handling fee to be received by the agency originally acting as the National Treasury sub-treasury shall be settled clearly up to the date of handover and reported by its superior agency to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank for transfer to the Ministry of Finance for approval and issuance. The original agent agency shall also settle the interest on various deposits and custody funds clearly up to the date of handover. In addition to those who directly settle accounts with depositors, they shall be transferred to the new agent agency for safekeeping and transferred to depositors when settling interest.

### Review of "The Problem of the European Federation"

— Sun Hang

Written by Xiao Jinfang, Published by China Cultural Service Society

Churchill is one of the most vigorous advocates of the "European Federation," but no matter how much oratorical genius he has, and how much moving enthusiasm he possesses, people are indifferent. This is not to blame others, but to blame old man Churchill himself.

Originally, the "European Federation" shouted by old man Churchill was nothing more than a reincarnation of imperialism. To put it plainly, it was nothing more than a magic weapon for the British Empire to confront the Soviet Bear. You think, with this goal, the value of the federation itself has been lost, and how can Europe be united as desired in a tug-of-war situation?

Federation is an ideal, and a noble and valuable ideal, just as Washington said: "I am a citizen of the great republic of mankind...I see mankind united as families are united by brotherly relations. We have sown the seeds of freedom and union, seeds that will germinate slowly throughout the world. One day, the European Federation will be established on the model of the American Federation." Washington was right and represented the thoughts of most thinkers. But the federation is by no means based on imperialism. It should have many good foundations, namely freedom, equality, fraternity, peace and other good nouns and good behaviors recognized by mankind.

Unfortunately, although the European Federation has a long history, it has not been able to establish itself on these foundations to this day. Some say that Europe has always been a powder keg, and that is true. Because of this, the problem of the European Federation is indeed a big problem.

In China, there are no special works discussing the European Federation, so Mr. Xiao Jinfang's new book "The Problem of the European Federation" should undoubtedly be praised. This book is divided into five parts. The first part, what is the European Federation and the occurrence of this problem. This is biased towards theoretical explanations, in which Mr. Xiao describes the nature of federation, confederation, sovereignty, etc. in a very organized manner, but is a little less concrete. People who have not studied political science may have many difficulties reading it. The second part, the evolution of the European Federation plan. This part talks about all the ideals and plans about the European Federation from the Greek and Roman eras to the modern era. The materials are rich and accurate. Reading it, you can know the views of many ancients on the European problem. The third part, the evolution of the European customs union. The customs union is an economic union, and the author attaches great importance to it. The fourth part, regional consultation. This part is divided into two parts, one part describes political consultations such as the Little Entente, the Locarno Consultation, and other political unions. One part describes economic consultations, that is, the so-called customs union. The author praises the customs union very much, and said in the conclusion of the book: "The most effective ones are the customs union, such as the the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union, the German-Austrian customs union, the steel union, and the Oslo group, which are all clear evidence." The fifth part, the trend of the European Federation. This part compares the claims of the Axis powers and the United Nations on the European problem, and describes the plans put forward by all parties since 1940, and attaches the author's personal speculation on the future European situation.

Looking at the whole book, there are more historical materials and fewer theoretical materials, and the author himself has very few opinions or claims. But this is not the author's fault. The problem of the European Federation has not yet reached the stage of formally appearing on the stage. All the enthusiasm and plans of the ancients are just some gongs and drums. It is impossible to criticize a play that has not yet been performed. The author has done his best to move out his remote and recent causes, and those who are interested will slowly open his curtain and watch it carefully.

But because these are historical narratives and records of events, the whole book does not have an independent central idea, which may be a shortcoming of this book. The author of this book seems to only want to explain the evolution of the European problem. Although he will make a comprehensive judgment in the conclusion, the Tao is too simple and does not help matters. Therefore, this book is a history book, not a theoretical book. As the former, this book is undoubtedly successful, but as the latter, it seems insufficient.

Regarding the author's views on the European Federation, one can only see a little between the lines. But there are also some questionable points:

The author said: "Regarding the definition of federation, scholars have different opinions. Simply put, a federation is a supreme state, and its constituent countries have some subordinate relationship to it in some respects." (page 9) What is a supreme state, the author did not specify. But according to general political science views, this supreme state should be a new union, and its relationship with the constituent countries is just like that of the United States of America to the states. It does not mean that there is a particularly strong state in each state to rule the other states. But on page 249, the author said: "But who is the supreme state? During the two world wars, some writers advocated France, and some advocated Germany,...and some advocated the League of Nations...Now some people advocate Britain and the Soviet Union." According to this statement, the supreme state of the federation can be an existing strong country, which is not only incompatible with the original meaning of the federation, but also completely inconsistent with the author's principle of "all countries are equal in law, regardless of size" (page 256). The author's misunderstanding may be because the author has not distinguished the truth of the federation. The author said on page 253, "Since there are two supreme states in postwar Europe, I will not ask whether Britain and the Soviet Union can continue to cooperate. Even if they can continue to cooperate, European countries are unwilling to give up their sovereignty, and Britain and the Soviet Union are not purely European countries. Europeans may not be convinced of their rule. What's more, De Gaulle, Foreign Minister Bidault, and Foreign Minister Lange have all expressed their opposition?..." What is said here refers to the talks between Churchill and Smuts mentioned on page 205, but the European Federation called by Churchill and Smuts is the imperialist European Federation, which is not the federation that the author had in mind when defining the federation. I have said at the beginning of this article that Churchill's federation is a reincarnation of imperialism. Smuts's talk especially clearly points out that the so-called European Federation should be led by Great Britain. How can this be an equal federation of all countries? The author failed to distinguish between the two, and it is inevitable that he will misunderstand the meaning of the supreme state. The federation can only be established on the basis of equality and freedom, which is what the author advocates. This must not be confused with power politics, otherwise, the meaning of the federation will be very different.

Generally speaking, this book has spent considerable effort in collecting materials, and due to the various thoughts and various plans, there are inevitably unrelated and unsystematic places. It is not easy for the author to list them one by one. Readers who want to seek a systematic concept of the European Federation problem will find this book to be a good book, but those who like to think and do further research will find this book to be too brief.

### Appraisal of Two English Grammar Books

— Lu Zenghu

Miao Tingfu's "High School English Grammar," published by Shanghai Longmen Bookstore, and "Middle School Modern English Grammar," published by Shanghai Guangxie Bookstore.

Grammar is not a profound and specialized subject. It is merely a habit of English and American people in speaking and writing. The reason why students are afraid of grammar is that many grammarians have described this habit too academically and discussed it too theoretically, which makes students feel confused after reading it. Therefore, the compilation and narrative methods of grammar must be carefully considered. It must be able to grasp the psychology of students and cater to their needs, so as to be truly helpful to them.

Among the grammar books I have used over the years, I think Mr. Miao Tingfu, an English professor at Soochow University, wrote "Advanced English Grammar" and "Middle School Modern English Grammar," which are the most suitable for students' tastes. Because these two books are suitable for different levels, their compilation is also different. "Middle School Modern English Grammar" is suitable for lower grades, such as the first year of junior high school and the first year of senior high school, focusing on the most basic principles of grammar, starting with simple sentences and gradually introducing the writing of compound sentences and complex sentences. "Advanced English Grammar" is suitable for higher grades, and the content is more detailed. The first part talks about the eight parts of speech, the second part talks about the structure of sentences, and the third part talks about punctuation. Although the compilation of these two books is different, they all have the same characteristics.

The first feature is that they both focus on comparing many example sentences and do not focus on abstract and boring theories. For example, in English, mood and tense are the most incredible things for Chinese students. Mr. Miao must have deeply felt in his more than 20 years of teaching English that it is not appropriate to overemphasize these two things and make a lengthy and empty theory, which will make students' concepts vague. Therefore, on the contrary, Miao Guangsheng only gives readers some example sentences, plus very simple explanations, so that students can fully understand after reading them, and feel that the so-called mood and tense are nothing more than this.

After readers can fully understand the habits of grammar, the second task that follows is practice. The second feature of these two books is that they both provide rich exercises, so that students can repeatedly practice the application of a certain principle in grammar, practice makes perfect, and when they encounter a very common type of sentence that students cannot apply or cannot construct correctly, they are given hints, so that students can gradually become proficient in this structure and apply it smoothly and correctly. The exercises contain this kind of inspiring hint, which can be said to be the unique feature of these two books.

The third feature of these two books (especially the advanced one) is that they all supplement enough Chinese sentences for translation purposes. Obviously, the purpose of these translation sentences is not to test students' vocabulary, but to help students understand several more important items in grammar (such as tense mood, relative pronouns, and several commonly overlooked auxiliary verbs such as must, can, may, dare, need, would rather, etc.) can be used more skillfully and skillfully, and in the places where it is needed, the same inspiring hints are given. When students feel unfamiliar words and idioms, they are given English names to avoid their painful groping and ignoring the important methods of sentence structure. Vocabulary is important, but when teaching grammar, teachers should not use too many words that are unfamiliar to students, so as to avoid making them feel confused and afraid, and abandon all kinds of sentence construction skills.

There are several verbs: belong, happen, occur, like, raise, rise, sit, lie, lay, etc. There are also several words in adjectives and adverbs, such as afraid, worth, hard, hardly, good, well, here, there, possible, impossible, very, much, etc., which students often find are not paid attention to and misused. Then, in these two books, a special reminder is made, and examples of wrong and correct comparisons are provided, so that students can produce a deep and correct impression, and will not suffer from repeated mistakes. This point can be said to be the fourth feature.

Finally, they also have a significant feature, that is, the prepositions they contain. Originally, most of the prepositions and idioms in English need to be memorized, so readers often feel bored. The prepositions and idioms listed in these two books are all those that we usually encounter in general reading materials, so they can be regarded as the most common, and they are attached with simple and practical examples, and some even exemplify the different usages of each other, and there is no drawback that makes readers feel boring. On the contrary, they can arouse readers' interest and guide them to imitate themselves.

The above is just a summary of these two books. If you read them once, you will definitely find that they are indeed two successful works. Mr. Miao used his unique insights gained from his usual research in English and the valuable experience gained from teaching English over the years, and wrote these two crystallized grammar textbooks with simple and skillful compilation and writing, which can be called a practical and beneficial help for those who learn English.

### The Human Comedy

— Shi Jimei

Author: William Saroyan (USA) Translator: Liu Wugou Publisher: Wenguang Bookstore

The sun sank hazily in the tranquility of dusk. Homer Macauley sat on an old bicycle, wearing ill-fitting messenger clothes. From today on, Homer was a messenger for the telegraph office. Although he was only fourteen years old, when the rules stipulated at least sixteen, Homer Macauley had to set aside some time from his studies to work. He was now the "man" of the house. His father had died, and his brother Marcus was in the army. He had to find a profession. His family lived on St. Clara Road in Ithaca, California. His mother worked in a meat packing plant, his sister Bess was studying at the state university, and four-year-old Ulysses, his brother, was a naive and interesting little child. The Macauley family, like most rural families in Ithaca, was poor but happy. Every day, like today, the sun sank hazily in the tranquility of dusk. This tranquility at dusk was deeply cherished by the people of Ithaca, as well as the orchards and vineyards, and the old, old soil of California.

From then on, Homer studied at school during the day and worked at the telegraph office after school. He was an extremely diligent messenger. Mr. Spengler, the kind-hearted manager, liked him very much. Old Mr. Grogan, the telegraph operator, also got along very well with him. His professional life taught him to understand everything better. He experienced the hardships and sweetness of life. In just a few days, he grew up a lot, but everything was still so peaceful, tranquil, and full of love.

In the evening, music came from the Macauley's house on St. Clara Road. Bess and Mrs. Macauley played Marcus's favorite tunes, and Mary Arena, Marcus's lover, also sang. Little Ulysses listened on the side, murmuring many questions he did not understand, and gradually fell asleep sweetly. Every night was spent like this. Mrs. Macauley sat in the old rocking chair waiting for Homer to return. They talked about things that happened during the day. "You must try to love everyone you meet" - this was the mother's teaching to her son. Everything was so peaceful, tranquil, and full of love.

Yes, everything was so peaceful, tranquil, and full of love. - Miss Hicks, the ancient history teacher at Ithaca High School, was incredibly fair, the principal respected his teachers, and even Hubert Ackley, who had quarreled with Homer, was a well-educated rich kid. Nine-year-old newsboy Auggie already knew how to strive for progress, young Diana was devoted, and four-year-old baby Ulysses would take two-and-a-half dimes to the store for his mother to buy mushrooms. On a rainy night, Bess and Mary encountered three strange young soldiers. They were returning to the barracks tomorrow. The two girls hugged Marcus and happily agreed to accompany them to the movies. Old Mr. Grogan spoke with a strange, universal loving expression, talking about the war. The war caused so many deaths, but those working at the telegraph office had to cruelly send these death notices to the families of the deceased...

Far away from Ithaca, Marcus and the young men of America, the rich and the poor, who abandoned their dreams of great careers to enlist in the army, who abandoned their dreams of gentle peace to fight... lived together. He and his friends, Topee and George, talked about his hometown, lovely Ithaca, his deceased father, his mother, brothers, his lover Mary, and sister Bess. Topee, who grew up in an orphanage, yearned for it. In his longing, he fell in love with Bess, fell in love with Macauley, fell in love with Ithaca, because now Ithaca seemed to be his hometown. So Marcus wrote a letter to his brother Homer: "...For me, the motherland is Ithaca, our home, and everything about the Macauley family..." He also introduced his friend Topee. - When Homer Macauley continued this letter at the Ithaca telegraph office, even Mr. Grogan was deeply moved. This fourteen-year-old "man," his eyes filled with tears: "If my brother dies in this stupid war, I will curse this world, I will hate it forever, I will no longer be good, I will be the worst person in the world..."

This day finally came cruelly: that unfortunate Sunday, Homer found old Mr. Grogan suddenly dead at the telegraph office. A severe heartache made him stop breathing, leaving an unfinished telegram on the typewriter. It was for Mrs. Macauley: "To report the following matters, the military government deeply regrets your son Marcus-" Marcus was finished like this, his young and promising life, his love for his homeland and family... Homer put the telegram in his pocket. Now, the world was different. Everything in Ithaca had changed, because Marcus could not see anything. Mr. Spengler, the manager of the telegraph office, tried his best to comfort him, telling him that Marcus was still alive, alive in the love of all his loved ones.

Was Marcus really still alive? On this peaceful evening in a lonely town, the strings of the harp in the Macauley's house soothed the pain of all things in the world. A lame soldier walked to the steps of the front porch. He had returned to Ithaca, his "never-before-seen birthplace." Homer helped this "familiar stranger" into the house. The soldier gave a ring to Bess. He was Topee George. He told Bess, "Believe me, Marcus is not dead." There was a gentle pain on his face...

The story ends like this. What cannot end is the warm feeling of peace, tranquility, and love that this book gives people. Just like Marcus in the book, although he is no longer in this world, in the hearts of those who love him, Marcus is still alive, and will live forever.

This is a novel with war as the background, but the book does not directly describe the war. It only depicts a peaceful and ordinary family in a peaceful and ordinary town in America, and how the whole family lives bravely and with dignity in war, poverty, and misfortune. The characters in the book are not successful, but they are all extremely great. If you don't believe in "human nature is good," it is simply hard to believe that it is true. This is a beautiful illusion, with no hate, only love, no ugliness and baseness, only beauty and kindness. Perhaps lacking political awareness, it is full of warm human touch. Because this book does not tell us why Americans are fighting, what historical significance this war has, it only teaches us how to endure the misfortunes brought by war with gentle patience, and to comfort the deaths and separations caused by war with human love and purity.

The author of this book, William Saroyan, is a new American writer. He grew up in California and worked as a newsboy and telegraph messenger like Homer in his early years. He ended his school life early. In 1939, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his play "The Time of Your Life." The book "The Human Comedy" was published in the spring of 1943 and ranked fourth among the best-selling literary works in the United States that year.

### Destroy "Corruption"

— Shilang

When the deeds of Chinese "corruption" are rendered as objects of exaggeration by international figures, a person who is a citizen of China is indeed ashamed and has no place to hide.

Can you provide proof that there is no such thing?

A series of reports of corruption cases are being investigated, and thoroughly investigated. However, constant and certain corruption incidents are being cleverly manufactured and deployed.

Low-paid employees are also sincerely lamenting:

"How can we live on this little salary!"

So corruption is like a癣, creeping from his neck all over his body. It is not easy to cure him, and there is no such divine medicine to get rid of the root.

The Chinese people are too deeply poisoned. Even with serum, the bacteria of corruption cannot be expelled from the blood of the Chinese people.

First, traditionally, everyone unreasonably worships "wealth," regardless of whether it is stolen, robbed, swindled, or even skillfully embezzled money. People look up to you, flatter you, this psychological suggestion and the decline of personal morality are enough to prompt every young person to devote himself to the illusion of the golden dream.

Second, to thoroughly eliminate corruption, we believe that we should fundamentally start from "cultivating integrity," so that every staff member can be guaranteed in their work and life, establish a personnel system, and promote welfare undertakings, so that the staff in every job position can have no worries, and their lives can be carefree. If this stage can be achieved, may I ask who would dare to risk the law? Who would be willing to break the law knowing it?

Now, many positions where you can "embezzle" and "make money" are often regarded as a rare and "rich" job. How much influence does the existence of this psychology have on this society!

The case of corruption and malpractice by auditors of the direct tax bureau, which was criticized by the Senate, is that in peacetime, their extravagance and splendor in life, and the rottenness of society, are highly praised. What a terrible "encouragement" this is!

On this land, to destroy "corruption," we must start from the root; otherwise, the kingdom of "corruption" will only expand, and the "encirclement and suppression" after the fact will be of no avail.

### Dancers and Nurses

— Han Manli

Editor's note: Han Manli, a reader of this newspaper, works at Siming Hospital. Seeing that this publication has articles discussing the issue of dancers' livelihoods after the dance ban, she specifically sent this manuscript, and put forward opinions on whether dancers can become nurses.

After a long war, the motherland needs active construction and comprehensive reforms to catch up with the flood of the atomic age. Therefore, life needs to be frugal, and banning dance naturally becomes a prerequisite for frugality. However, how to arrange the aftermath of this group of practitioners in the dance industry? Where should dancers go after losing their jobs? This has become a social problem that needs to be solved urgently. In various newspapers (August 19, Shen Bao, Dagong Bao, etc.), I saw that the government authorities' handling of dancers' unemployment was: "Indeed, there was an intention to train dancers in the short term and then appoint them as nurses." I am engaged in nursing work. Here, in addition to celebrating that we will have another group of people serving the poor and sick, we also want to introduce the status and tasks of nurses once:

When the Crimean War broke out, on the European battlefields, field hospitals were full of bleeding wounded soldiers. When they used their lives to protect the weapons of the motherland, but after being injured, the result was that, except for the hot blood still washing the wounds, the groans merged into a chorus, there was no complete organization to take care of these wounded and sick warriors. At this time, a British noblewoman with erudition and talent was summoned by justice, compassion, and fraternity, abandoned her comfortable and luxurious aristocratic life, and resolutely rushed to the front line. She wrapped wounds for the wounded, gave them soup and medicine, nursed, and comforted them. Therefore, sunlight appeared in the shadow of painful illness, and in the lonely night, she held an oil lamp and patrolled non-stop, spreading light, caressing and nursing. The mortality rate of patients was quickly reduced. In the great war, she left an indelible contribution, which is the founder of our nurses, Florence Nightingale. Later, this spirit laid the foundation for the nursing profession, followed by the establishment of schools and the formal training of nursing talents.

Up to now, nurses who have graduated from formal schools in our country must have graduated from middle school (because of the needs of learning, many have graduated from high school or after two years of university before entering nursing schools) and then go through three and a half years of formal nursing school education before they can become a complete nurse. In this academic program, they must complete more than ten required courses such as anatomy, physiology, nursing, pharmacology, personal hygiene, public health, bacteriology, internal medicine nursing, surgical nursing, and ethics. For their work, giving a pill and giving first aid are of paramount importance, affecting the safety of the patient's entire life. Therefore, they must understand the entire structure of the human body, the effects of drugs, and how bacteria invade the human body to cause disease factors, and how to resist, kill, and prevent the spread of diseases. They are with the patients all day or all night, so they must have patience, kindness, compassion, and a dignified attitude, and a strong physique to understand the pain of the patients and give care and comfort. They are like the sunlight in spring, giving people joy and hope, and with the determination to sacrifice themselves, they strive for the life and health of mankind. Although it is fishy and dirty, the smile of the patient after regaining health is their only comfort in their hearts. I have to thank God for choosing the skills and profession of nursing from thousands of jobs.

I sympathize with how many compatriots who have been reduced to dancers, some of them have received quite high education. For the sake of life and family, they do not hesitate to sacrifice their souls in exchange for the price of life, but how many have not received education? They are almost illiterate, and in a decadent life, they are accustomed to enjoyment and lewdness. I am happy for society, and for them to leave the life of exchanging sex for money and engage in the sacred, noble, and solemn nursing work. But in order to shoulder this great responsibility and the necessary knowledge and moral cultivation, we suggest that the authorities can give these sisters the necessary basic education and then three or four years of nursing education, so that they can become complete nurses in terms of ethics and knowledge - nursing work is by no means a "new continent" that those who are at the end of their rope can jump to!

### Dancers' Way Out

— Xiao Kangshi

A bolt from the blue strikes the dance hall,

Frugality bans dance, talking about dancers;

It is difficult to be a nurse because they are accustomed to luxury, how can they know how to cook if they return to the kitchen!

Since the frugality order was issued, there has been talk of banning dance, but the way out for many dancers has become a major problem. Some people suggest training them to serve as "nurses," but how can their "luxury-loving nature" abide by this strict life? According to this newspaper on the 19th, Director Wu believes that the way out for dancers is "better to marry," but how can they "cook in the kitchen" when their daily life is to enter and leave restaurants with guests, and their nightly income is quite rich?

### "Comforting Teachers"

— A Teacher

The Municipal Education Bureau specially announced commemorative measures for Teachers' Day, the fourth item of which is: "Hold activities to comfort teachers, which will be held separately or jointly by students of all levels of schools." The teachers were not excited when they saw this program, because they knew deeply that it would not be realized. Just imagine that during the summer vacation, the students are scattered in all directions. What method can be used to gather them? Secondly, they are racking their brains for the tuition fees and book fees for the next semester. They say that they want to repay the teacher's kindness, but they do not have the surplus funds to purchase comforting items. This activity will certainly not succeed.

But what teachers are paying attention to is not temporary comfort, but regular expenses. After looking forward to the adjustment for three months, they received the cash equivalent of two斗 of rice. If they want to ask for more, they have to wait until December to have hope. During this period, they have to cope with more than 30,000 times the cost of living with an income equivalent to 3,000 times the pre-service income.

### Miscellany from America

— Xu Shuyuan

Working and Studying in America

America has always been the paradise in the minds of knowledge youth. It is true that people who return from studying in America are generally considered to have more refined minds and enjoy considerable prestige in academic and social circles. However, this is just a generalization. There are indeed American-educated students who are confused and suffer tragic unemployment. On the one hand, after the U.S. military deployed to China, they scattered U.S. dollar bills like the moon in the sky. This painted America as a prosperous and affluent country. The Americans spending money wildly in China were not just showing off in front of yellow faces; they spent just as enthusiastically in America. Because the Chinese masses are so poor, they see five or ten U.S. dollar bills as large as millstones. From the perspective of those who use U.S. dollars as their currency, what's so rare about it? Due to these two kinds of stimuli, America naturally becomes a heaven in the minds of Eastern youth. Indeed, America is the wealthiest country in the world and the most artificially beautiful country in the world. But if this leads the average Chinese youth to think about going to America to work and study, they will run into obstacles. First, it is not easy to obtain a passport to go abroad. Those who are most likely to obtain a passport are important government officials, followed by shrewd businessmen, then publicly funded students. The most miserable are self-funded students, who are scolded everywhere. Second, even if you are fortunate enough to get a passport and arrive on the other side, getting into a school might not be a problem to solve the "study" part, but when it comes to "work," it becomes a big problem. After the war, millions of soldiers returned from the front lines and needed work, and millions of military workers needed to change careers. They have the military and unemployment bureaus to introduce jobs. We Chinese have not obtained citizenship, so unemployment will not be introduced to you. But if you don't work, you won't have money to pay tuition or living expenses. You are not from a rich family, so you must "work" if you want to "study." With nowhere to turn, only some sporadic jobs are left for Chinese students to do. One type of job is teaching Chinese. Many American schools have Chinese classes and Chinese philosophy and Chinese history courses. If you can lecture directly in English, you can probably barely make a living from this. However, American students are talkative and like to ask all sorts of questions, such as the issues between the Nationalists and Communists, and corruption issues. If you can't answer them, they will explain it for you "Those questions are inconvenient to answer." Another type of job is working as a temporary library staff member or typing for professors, with pay calculated by the hour. The income is extremely limited and cannot be relied upon to make a living. If you are a woman, you can take care of children for others, nominally as a nanny but actually as a maid, because the owner can ask you to sweep the floor, cook, and help wash diapers for the children. Fortunately, American children don't use many diapers, so this job is relatively easy. Another type of job is writing articles for overseas Chinese newspapers, earning about two or three U.S. dollars per thousand words. Writing one article every day, you can earn seventy or eighty dollars a month, which is barely enough to live on. The most appropriate job, in my opinion, is washing dishes in restaurants, because American restaurants no longer use male waiters, so this line of work has been snatched up by American and Mexican women. Restaurants need meticulous hand washers. Chinese people are meticulous and don't break dishes, so they are most welcomed by American bosses, starting at four U.S. dollars per hour. This kind of work is quite strenuous, working at most three hours a day, earning twelve dollars or more, which is three hundred and sixty dollars a month, which is not a small amount. Chinese chefs are most popular in America. Once, the U.S. military recruited twenty Chinese chefs to work in Alaska, providing food, lodging, clothing, and three hundred and sixty U.S. dollars per month, plus travel expenses and subsidies. At the time, I quite wanted to resign from my military post and take a trip to Alaska, but it never became a reality. Eastern cooking is truly a great way for working and studying students to make money. If you can intern at a famous restaurant for a year before going abroad, you can have great ambitions after arriving in America, and accumulating hundreds of thousands (in U.S. dollars) is only a matter of two or three years.

### Shaoxing Native Association in Shanghai to Establish "Zhonghui" University Scholarship for Needy Students

All university students with financial difficulties and excellent academic standing may apply.

The tuition and miscellaneous fees stipulated for the next semester in schools at all levels in this city have increased several times compared to the previous semester, forcing many poor students to drop out of school, and most parents also feel overwhelmed. Education is the foundation of the nation, and youth are the future pillars of the country. If education is not properly managed today, how can the country be governed in the future and embark on the road to prosperity? In view of this, our association is rushing to provide scholarships, adhering to the past purpose of helping students, rescuing dropouts, ensuring that learning continues uninterrupted, and thereby storing talent for the country. Since this newspaper launched the scholarship campaign, all sectors of society have responded enthusiastically. For example, the Shaoxing Native Association in Shanghai, in order to aid students who are at risk of dropping out of school, has specially established the "Zhonghui" University Scholarship for Needy Students. All children of Shaoxing natives in Shanghai who are in financial difficulty, of good character, and in good health, who have graduated from high school in the country or are enrolled in a university in the country, with main subject grades above 80 points and an overall average grade above 70 points, and who are recommended by a member of the association and certified by the school authorities, may apply for this scholarship in accordance with the regulations. The application location is at the Shaoxing Native Association in Shanghai, 127 Liuhe Road, this city. The application period is from now until September 5th. Inquiries about application procedures can be made directly at the location.

### Map Drawing Methods

To the Editor: I am quite interested in geography and am currently studying map drawing methods, but I have no books to refer to, so I have not been able to grasp the basics, which I deeply regret. I am specially submitting this request for your guidance, for which I would be most grateful.

[This column answers] To Nanmao-jun: Map drawing methods are a specialized technical field, and there are not many books on this subject in our country. "Map Drawing and Reading Methods" compiled by Ge Suicheng, published by Zhonghua Book Company, and "Cartography and Map Drawing Methods" written by Zhang Ziping, published by Commercial Press, can both be used as references. In addition, there are also special chapters on this topic in advanced surveying and geodesy, which can also be consulted. Among such books, the more famous ones are: (1) Higher Surveying by Breed & Hosmer (2) Geodetic's Ingram. They are all available for sale at the Shanghai Longmen Bookstore, priced at around 50,000 yuan.

### Readers' Mailbox

To Luo Lian-jun in Shanghai: I have received your letter. Since the student has failed several courses, they should be held back a grade, and the school naturally cannot issue a certificate of attendance with "passing grades." Moreover, since they are in the third year of high school, it is probably not possible to issue a certificate of attendance for the second year of high school, in order to prevent abuses. High school is the foundation for university, so it must be studied well to lay a good foundation; otherwise, it will not be easy to pass the university entrance exam, and even if you are lucky enough to get in, it will be difficult to complete the four-year program smoothly. There is no room for speculation or trickery in seeking knowledge. Please advise the student to concentrate on studying.

To Ruan Fangze-jun: I have received your letter. Students of correspondence schools do not have student status, so it is probably impossible to transfer to the second year of the law school at a university. It may be recognized if the school is approved and registered by the Ministry of Education.

To Qing Jin-jun in Shanghai: I have received your letter. You can take the entrance exam for a five-year vocational school with the equivalent educational background of a junior high school graduate. (If the original school attended was a puppet school or an unregistered private school, then its certificate of attendance is invalid). It is now the enrollment period for various schools, so look for enrollment advertisements in the Gazette.

To Lu Zheru-jun in Shanghai: I have received your letter. Please inquire directly with the organization in charge of the examination.

To Gu Changye-jun in Shanghai: I have received your letter. (1) Since the second-year high school certificate of attendance has been lost, you cannot apply to universities with the equivalent educational background. Since the provincial Linzhong High School has been dissolved, the remedy is to directly submit a request to the Provincial Department of Education to check the case and issue a certificate document. (2) Regarding the explanation of the term "zhishi," this is a respectful term used in letters to show humility to the other person.

To Jiang Wangtingcen-jun in Yunnan: I have received your letter. The address of Liangyou Publishing Company is Room 514, Hatong Building, Nanjing East Road, Shanghai. We have sent a letter on your behalf, but have not yet received a reply. Also, the address of Rensheng Publishing House could not be found because the company is not a member of the industry association. This column has published a notice, but there have been no results. This is a special reply for your information!

To Shaoren-jun in Shanghai: I have received your letter. You can inquire at Baoxue Tongyi Hall at 163 Henan Middle Road or Dajiang Agricultural Company on Jiangxi Road. There are also many butterfly farms in Pudong. Inquire there, and you may be able to find out where to buy them.

To Lu Yu-jun in Shanghai: I have received your letter. (1) Before the war, students who completed the required period of regular and concentrated military training were issued a "Certificate of Completion of School Military Education" by the former Training Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission. Although centralized training was held in different areas, the certificates were naturally issued uniformly without any distinction. (2) Since you have not received this certificate, you can ask the original school attended to submit a request to the current supervising authority to reissue it. (3) The Preparatory Office of the Alumni Association of All Sessions of High School and Above Schools in Shanghai for Concentrated Training is located in the Nanhai Garden at No. 830 Nanjing West Road. It is unknown whether there is an alumni association organization for students who were trained in Zhenjiang. If there is an organization, it must be registered with the supervising authority, so it seems that you can write to the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education or the Zhenjiang County Government Education Section for inquiries.
