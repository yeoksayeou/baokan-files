[Another dispatch] The Preparatory Committee decided on the National Assembly's expenditures on the 27th. The principle is based on a one-month period, calculating: Representative reception expenses account for 56% of the total, including travel expenses at 19%, public expenses at 6%, accommodation expenses at 9%, food expenses at 7%, reception station expenses at 8%, and special expenses at 7%. Equipment expenses account for 22% of the total, including assembly hall equipment expenses at 5%, dining equipment expenses at 9%, and transportation equipment expenses at 8%. Deliberation expenses account for 14% of the total. Administrative expenses account for 8%. This session has 3,039 representatives, an 80% increase compared to the last assembly. Train and plane ticket prices have increased by over 2,000% compared to last year, and food, accommodation, and miscellaneous expenses have increased by around 1,500%. Calculating on a per capita basis, the last assembly's reception fee was 2.6 million yuan per person, while this time it should be 21 million yuan. However, because this assembly's session is shorter, the increase is not that large. Regarding equipment, in addition to making maximum use of last year's original equipment, additional food and accommodation equipment, construction of lounges capable of accommodating 2,000 people, additional parking lots, and rental of buses are needed.

[Another dispatch] It is estimated that each participating representative can receive 3 million yuan in public expenses and 4.5 million yuan in accommodation expenses during the National Assembly, along with over 3.6 million yuan in food expenses, all calculated on a one-month basis. Representative travel expenses are calculated based on the region from which the representative was elected, including travel expenses in addition to train and plane ticket costs. Overseas representatives, calculated based on the number of representatives and their location, require over 180,000 US dollars in total. The Preparatory Committee intends to request approval of foreign exchange, to be paid based on the actual number of attendees.

### Our Attitude Towards the Current Government of Siam Under Consideration; Siamese Ambassador Ignores Dismissal Order

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 27th] Since the news of Siamese Ambassador Durarale's dismissal by the new government of Siam reached here, all parties have paid close attention. The reporter corps has especially focused on the expression of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but up to the time of this reporter's dispatch, there was still no news. However, according to reliable sources, this matter is under the careful consideration of Foreign Minister Wang. After Durarale learned of his dismissal announced by the current government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the press, he told this newspaper's reporter that he had not yet received notification from Bangkok. However, he had anticipated this result since he made it clear that he would not obey the current government's laws. Durarale smiled and pointed to the silver box containing his credentials, saying, "My credentials are still here, acknowledged and accepted by the Chinese government. If the Chinese government recognizes the current government of Siam, I will naturally return to my country and retire to the countryside. Until then, I will ignore it and continue to perform my duties." Durarale declined to comment on whether the current government is likely to be recognized by other countries, only smiling and saying, "This can be seen from the treatment received by their representatives sent to Baguio to attend the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. In any case, the current government came to power by force rather than legally."

### Gu Weijun's Speech: The United States Should Value China's Situation

"Our report" New York, 27th Broadcast: Washington dispatch. Today is Thanksgiving. China's representative to the United Nations, Gu Weijun, gave a 15-minute broadcast speech on CBS, strongly advocating that the United States should value China's situation based on the Marshall Plan and provide rapid assistance. Gu said: The Marshall Plan has great significance for the recovery of the world. China and the Far East are also among the regions that need this assistance, because China not only needs to rebuild its economy, but is also facing the threat of the expansion of communist forces. Gu still held an optimistic attitude toward the United Nations organization, believing that this organization is the only major gain after World War II and believing that once the international security force is established, it will be able to take on the responsibility of maintaining world peace.

### Far East Economic Commission in Stalemate; Siamese Representative Angrily Departs; The Commission has Allowed Siam to Join

[United Press, Baguio, 27th] The Far East Economic Commission on the 27th has allowed Siam to join as a member. However, two Siamese representatives said they have firmly decided to take the opportunity to return home. The Commission discussed Siam's membership on the 26th for two and a half hours, but no resolution was reached. The Siamese representatives said they felt "annoyed" by this delay. At noon on the 27th, Executive Secretary Lokanathan urgently telegraphed the Loakan Airport to persuade the Siamese representatives to stop their departure, saying, "Siam can participate." However, the Siamese representatives said they had made a decision and could not be persuaded to return after returning home. Philippine representative Guade told the United Press that he had telegraphed the Siamese consul in Manila, Pan Jins, to make a final effort to persuade the Siamese representatives to return to Baguio. He said the Philippine delegation hoped that Bangkok would change its instructions. The US representative suggested allowing Siam to participate, and the UK supplemented that allowing their participation was not "any step by the Committee's countries to recognize the Siamese government." The British and American proposal passed with eight votes in favor and one against. France abstained, and the Soviet Union opposed.

### The Executive Yuan Approves Temporary Domestic Sale of Some Export Goods

Export goods such as pork bristles, feathers, sausage casings, goatskins, gallnuts, tung oil, ramie, raw silk, and waste silk can be transported inland from Wuchang to various locations in Chenxian via the Yuehan Railway.

The certificate must be sent to the stationmaster of the railway station for verification before loading.

### $60 Million Aid to China Case Can Be Passed by US Congress Immediately

"Central News Agency, Washington, 26th" The House Foreign Affairs Committee's recommendation to include $60 million in aid to China in the emergency aid plan for Italy, France, and Austria is believed to be able to pass in Congress. If the House and Senate proceed with discussions according to the original procedure, the relief fund for China can be voted on in mid-December when the Congress special session completes its work on emergency foreign aid issues. The period of use for the $60 million aid to China is until March of next year, while the State Department's $300 million plan covers the 15-month period from April of next year to June 1949. Supporters of emergency aid to China do not expect that this $60 million can enable Nanjing to defeat the Communist Party, nor do they believe that the money can allow China to overcome its current economic crisis. However, they firmly believe that this is the first time Congress has appropriated funds to aid China, and anything that has begun, no matter how small, is better than not beginning at all. In addition, it is learned that before the House committee took action on this aid, Professor Mike McGowan of political science at Northwestern University warned the members of the committee that US aid to China was extremely necessary. He said that US aid could assure the Chinese people that they have the American people as their backing in their struggle against the Communist Party. China needs 1 to 1.5 billion US dollars and will need several months to restore its economy. Mr. Mai urged that an emergency aid of 60 to 70 million US dollars be given to China immediately, and said that this money would have an unparalleled impact on "restoring China's confidence, popular morale, and making China willing to help itself." Mr. Mai also suggested that this temporary aid be used to the greatest extent to "stabilize the currency."

### Brian Supports Dewey's Proposal for Aid to China

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] Brian, chairman of the fundraising campaign committee for the United Aid to China Association, expressed his support for Governor Dewey's call for economic aid to China. He pointed out that the Chinese people are more numerous than the Europeans and have suffered from the ravages of war for longer than the Europeans. China's need for assistance is even more urgent than that of Europe. He went on to say: The United Aid to Europe and its seven affiliated organizations will follow the correct path indicated by Dewey to assist China, that is, to assist China in training farmers in scientific methods to increase their food production, to assist Chinese workers in opening small-scale industrial cooperatives in rural areas, and to enable Chinese universities to continue to operate so as to train leaders and doctors for China. We have a better understanding of the meaning of US economic aid to China in China than any other organization in the United States, because we feel that the future of China and the United States is closely related. Therefore, we sincerely agree with Dewey's call for temporary economic aid to China. Brian is a famous banker in New York and was formerly the chairman of the United Aid to China Association.

Special Commentary

### Impropriety of Advocating the Opening of Inland River Navigation Rights

— Cheng Xuejiang

The English-language *Continental Daily News* published an article entitled "Yangtze River Shipping" advocating the opening of inland river navigation rights. Its reasons were: 1. Temporarily allowing foreign ships to navigate the Yangtze River could reduce upstream freight costs, which would help exports; 2. After the opening of inland river navigation rights, British merchants would benefit, and China's economy would benefit even more significantly; 3. If a foreign government were to demand the opening of inland river navigation rights by force, it would be a violation of sovereignty, but it would be a different matter if the Chinese government were to invite it voluntarily. Its conclusion was that the Chinese government should immediately allow foreign ships to navigate inland rivers for the sake of overall economic benefits, otherwise it would only allow a small number of merchants to monopolize the industry, which would not benefit the country at all.

When we carefully analyze the meaning of the *Continental Daily News*, it is no different from advocating for British merchants. At that time, the British parliamentary delegation to China expressed the intention to regain inland river navigation rights in our country. However, its reasons are very superficial. For example, it claims that temporarily allowing foreign ships to navigate inland rivers does not harm national sovereignty, and that it cannot be considered a violation of sovereignty if the Chinese government invites it voluntarily rather than being demanded by foreign force. It must be understood that sovereignty is extremely valuable and cannot be given away; if it is given away, how can it be said that there is no harm? And how can it be said that there is no violation? As for the claim that upstream freight costs can be reduced and exports can be increased after foreign ships navigate inland rivers, this is also a specious argument. Because foreign ships navigating inland rivers also require fuel consumption, repairs and depreciation, employee expenses, management fees, and tax payments. Since it is said that "British merchants will certainly benefit," it can be seen that it has not deviated from the scope of profit-making, and it may not necessarily be able to reduce freight costs independently. Now, British ships traveling to and from Hong Kong and Shanghai have not been heard to have lower freight costs than Chinese merchants, which is ironclad proof. Even if British ships lower their prices to compete in the Yangtze River shipping industry, it will be of little benefit to the export of local products and will be harmful to the entire national economy. Why? Because no matter how low the freight costs are, what we pay is the foreign exchange that British merchants use to exchange. The deficit in foreign exchange positions is well known. Now, import and export goods are mostly carried by foreign ships, which increases the expenditure of foreign exchange, which is already regrettable. Now, even the inland river freight costs must be paid in foreign exchange. Is this really in the interest of the country? Moreover, British merchants have been planning this for a long time, and past facts can be used as a warning. At the beginning of the establishment of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, its sole business was transporting tribute grain. Later, it acquired all the assets of Russell & Company, and its business flourished, which greatly alarmed British merchants. They abused the means of lowering prices and recklessly suppressed it. At that time, if Li Hongzhang had not fully protected it and only focused on the small calculation of reducing freight costs, then the tribute grain transport business would have been seized by British merchants. Also, in the past, when foreign merchants enjoyed inland river navigation rights in China, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire created the Freight Pool system and the Lower Yangtze Shipping Conference, which severely restricted the participation of Chinese merchants. Those who failed to participate were defeated. For this reason, the Chinese shipping industry has been difficult to develop. The same mistakes are still there, and we must take them as a warning.

As for the current sluggishness of our country's exports, it is certainly a fact. However, there are many factors, and it cannot be entirely blamed on freight costs, especially not entirely on inland river freight costs. Today, there are many local products for export in the interior that no one cares about, and there are even more local products for export stored in Shanghai's warehouses that cannot be exported. Before the price difference between domestic and foreign goods is still large and the import restrictions of various countries have not been relaxed, it is certainly not easy to promote exports. In terms of shipping, it is regrettable that there is still a lack of large ships that can open up ocean routes to save foreign exchange expenditure on freight costs. This is what we should all work together to achieve.

The so-called monopoly originally refers to a business that is only allowed to be handled exclusively by a certain professional agency. Today, there are more than one hundred shipping companies in China. All Chinese citizens have the right to form companies to navigate within the country. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and private shipping companies have the same rights and obligations. It is not comparable to the British merchants who used to navigate our country's inland rivers, who only enjoyed the right to navigate without the obligation to pay taxes. Therefore, in terms of the entire shipping industry, no one can talk about monopoly. If it is said that all undertakings will inevitably be monopolized if foreign merchants do not participate, then should our country's postal service and salt administration also be shared with foreign merchants to enjoy their benefits, and then can it be said that it is not monopolized?

If it is said that Chinese merchants can arbitrarily raise freight prices because there is no competition from foreign merchants, this is also an ignorant statement. Shipping is one of the public utilities, and any increase or decrease in passenger fares and freight charges is subject to the approval of the transportation authorities. Although the transportation authorities make reasonable adjustments from time to time based on the shipping industry's expenditures on fuel, wages, repairs, and interest, the time-sensitive adjustments are not as fast as the currency depreciation and the increase in other prices. Therefore, those who are familiar with the content of the shipping industry all know the difficulties faced by today's shipping companies. Foreign merchants also operate public utilities in Shanghai, and their rates have been adjusted many times. They are truly monopolized operators. Can they also be regarded as monopolies?

Our country's shipping industry has been unable to revive for many years due to the restrictions of unequal treaties. Now that inland river navigation rights have just been recovered and the shipping industry has just turned a corner, all of us Chinese people should encourage and advocate for rapid catching up. We hope that everyone will face the facts and express correct opinions so that the nascent Chinese shipping industry will no longer be destroyed. This will not only be a blessing for the Chinese shipping industry.

### Joint Annual Meeting of Agricultural Academic Organizations – Original Text of the Chairman's Address

(Continued from page 1)

"China is a country founded on agriculture. All political, economic, and social activities depend on the support of the vast countryside. The advancement of industrialization must be based on agriculture in order to be completed. In recent years, the countryside has been declining, and signs of distress are becoming increasingly apparent. Even the food supply is difficult to meet on its own. On a small scale, farmers' savings are empty, increasing social unrest; on a large scale, it damages national strength and cannot respond to world changes, which is a cause for great concern. It is imperative to strive to solve the problem of rural land, and to fully promote the improvement of agricultural production technology, the abundance of agricultural finance, the improvement of agricultural soil, the development of farmland water conservancy, and the guidance of rural social progress, first to seek agriculture to be able to stand firm and be self-sufficient, and then to plan for development. With China's abundant natural endowments, if we can add sincere and unremitting human effort and strive for progress every day, it will not be difficult to make our people well-fed and clothed, and bring the country to a prosperous and happy realm. However, this matter is of great importance, and it must be led by those who are enlightened and enlightened, leading all our innocent and simple farmers to carry out practical progress in order to have accurate and effective reforms. This is what is meant by the unity of knowledge and action. This joint annual meeting of agricultural academic organizations is held in Beijing, bringing together talents to plan the most important plan for people's livelihood and the foundation of the country.

### Spring Silkworm Cocoon Purchase Price Increased; Loan for Silk Reeling Workers Increased by 10 Billion

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 27th] The purchase price of spring silkworm cocoons was previously tentatively set at 31 million yuan per dan (a unit of weight), with the Central Farmers Bank providing advance payment and suspending interest calculation. The loan for silk reeling workers was also tentatively set at 1 million yuan per dan, totaling 84 billion yuan based on a tentative calculation of 14,000 dan of spring silkworm cocoons. The Four Joint Offices were to handle the matter according to the goods and forward the letter to the Central Farmers Bank. However, due to the recent surge in prices and the increase in the cost of living for silk reeling workers, as well as the soaring prices of fuels such as diesel and coal used for silk reeling power, the original 6 million yuan per dan for silk reeling labor costs was far from sufficient. The advance payment for purchasing silkworm cocoons should also be increased. The three regional silk reeling trade associations repeatedly forwarded applications from various lending manufacturers, requesting the Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Committee to make adjustments. After a meeting, the committee decided to increase the advance payment for silkworm cocoon purchases to 35 million yuan per dan and the loan for silk reeling workers to 10 million yuan per dan, increasing the total loan amount by 10 billion yuan. The committee has reported this to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and sent a letter to the Four Joint Offices and the Central Farmers Bank for handling.

### Important Documents Seized by National Army in Shandong; A Letter from a Communist Bandit Cadre (Continued) Sincerely States to Superiors That Military Morale Has Collapsed

Pessimism: Most of the soldiers who joined the army are downcast and silent, refusing to eat. Some are looking for their fellow villagers everywhere. When they see that their family members have been injured or killed, they wail loudly or sleep all day long. Some soldiers who have just joined the army cry and say, "I'm the only one left. I don't know when I'll die. The corpses of my fellow villagers can't even return home. It's so pitiful!" Some of the old soldiers eat and drink heavily. A squad leader said, "If you don't eat in this era, you don't know when you'll die?" Among the liberated soldiers, they don't believe that we can win the counterattack. They say, "If you eliminate the 26th Division, another 26th Division will come. If you eliminate the 72nd Division, another 72nd Division will come. The National Army will never be defeated, and they also have Americans providing assistance, and their equipment is getting better and better." They also say, "The Communist Party can't beat the central government at all. What happened in Tai'an in the past was just a fluke!" Therefore, the newly liberated soldiers are fleeing one after another. More than 120 people from the 22nd Regiment of the 8th Division deserted overnight. This is not counting the fact that special agents are also instigating them, and individuals are running away with machine guns on their shoulders.

Laxity: Cadres no longer care about problems such as desertion, lagging behind, or violations of discipline. A platoon leader said, "It's not exciting to be a squad leader and lead two or three soldiers, especially when marching." The 3rd Transport of the 26th Regiment randomly arrests civilians to carry backpacks, and the cadres don't care. Even a political commissar of the 27th Regiment, Yang Honghui, cried loudly and didn't ask about work.

Waiting for Reorganization: Inquiring about news and submitting reports are common sentiments everywhere. The "life-saving mentality" has also developed among cadres. There are six or seven people feigning illness and requesting rest. In the 9th Division (entirely), there are two at the battalion level, three at the company level, and two at the platoon level (three political workers). After the 4th Column arrived here from southern Shandong, they finally took a breath, but their thinking is very confused. The first is the expression of left and right-leaning sentiments. For example, a platoon leader said, "If you can't be killed in battle, you'll be killed by running away. If you can't be killed by running away, you'll be killed by starvation." Seventeen prisoners from the 4th Transport of the 31st Regiment organized an escape, taking ten guns with them, including two party members. The second is that the situation is unclear, and they don't believe in the victory of Liu Deng's (referring to Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, Deng being the political commissar of Liu's unit) army, saying, "Counterattack, counterattack, and Shandong is lost!" This area is not large, with the Yellow River on the northwest, the Grand Canal on the east, and the Longhai Railway on the south. We can't withstand the enemy's encirclement and suppression. If we win (referring to the opposite), we will have fewer people, lose our guns, and transfer to other people's areas. The 3rd Column has methods for attacking cities, but Jinan has not been taken. There are gunshots everywhere. The enemy is chasing us closely, and we are the "escape column"! The discipline of the 32nd Regiment is terrible, manifested in (A) beating and scolding local cadres; (B) randomly demanding grain, grass, and civilian laborers; (C) forcibly buying things and forcibly pulling livestock; (D) individual rape of women. Local government cadres run away when they see the southern troops, and the common people also avoid them. Comrade Lai Shaoqi wrote in a letter, "Our discipline is too bad! There is no way to do political work. The propaganda work is done, and now we can only use beheading to maintain it. Commander Chen (referring to Chen Yi) calculated everything, except for food. There are no shoes to walk in. So, because things are lost in the formation, there are many who sigh and regret the past all day long. In addition, there is a lot of beating and scolding in the troops. In the 32nd Regiment, except for the political commissar, deputy political commissar, and the political instructor of the 3rd Battalion, everyone else has been beaten. The 7th Transport soldiers reflect: If the regimental commander beats people again next time, we will run away, damn it."

Now, the cadres above the regimental level have a clear request, which is "replenishment and recuperation." In fact, if we continue to fight like this, we will collapse.

The enemy's plane is coming again, and gunfire has started! I will stop writing here and pay my respects. Your subordinate, Wang Danian, the 13th. (End) (Special Correspondent, 24th)

### Four Foreign Ministers Begin Discussing German Peace Treaty; Border Issues to Cause Disputes; Foreign Minister Representatives Discuss Austrian Issue

"This newspaper dispatch" London, 27th Broadcast: The Foreign Ministers Conference will hold its third meeting this afternoon, chaired by Marshall. Marshall will force Molotov to discuss the German border issue, with particular emphasis on the German-Polish border. According to reports, Molotov expressed his views on the German peace treaty yesterday, advocating for a swift signing of the peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of a strong German central government to replace the current Four-Power military government. His purpose is clearly to ingratiate himself with the German people as a form of propaganda offensive. Marshall's intention in raising the border issue is to strike a blow against the Soviet Union's propaganda. As is well known, the Soviet Union firmly insists on establishing the German-Polish border based on the Potsdam Agreement, a point that is clearly unpopular with the German people. Moreover, the Soviet Union has also expressed opposition to the incorporation of the Saar region into France and does not approve of any changes to Germany's western border. After Marshall raises the border issue, the Soviet Union will be forced to clarify its position on this thorny issue.

"United Press, London, 27th" The Soviet Union's delayed agreement to the British and American acceleration of discussions on the German peace treaty has created an atmosphere of cautious optimism at the Foreign Ministers Conference. Even those who take the most skeptical attitude towards the Soviet Union's motives admit that Molotov's public expression of the need to consider the German peace treaty as soon as possible is a major step forward, a shift in the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany.

French Foreign Minister Bidault is prepared to raise the explosive issue of Germany's western border at today's meeting and will once again insist that the four powers must agree that the Saar belongs to France. The debate on the border issue may reveal what concessions the Soviet Union is willing to make in order to achieve an early conclusion of the German peace treaty. The Soviet Union has consistently insisted on participating in the control of the Ruhr region, a point that the United Kingdom and the United States have refused to accept, while also opposing France's proposal to separate the Ruhr from Germany and place it under international administration. In the discussion of the German border issue, France may support the Soviet Union and will insist on changing the Potsdam understanding, while the United Kingdom and the United States want to return some agricultural areas east of the Oder and Neisse rivers to Germany.

"Reuters, London, 26th" The impasse at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the Austrian issue was broken today. It has now been agreed to place the Austrian issue as the first item on the agenda. After a brief discussion, the four foreign ministers agreed on the following agenda order: The Austrian peace treaty proposed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France; the German peace treaty, including procedural and border issues; the future economic principles of Germany; the form and scope of the German provisional government; a review of the implementation of the disarmament measures decided at the Moscow Conference; and the Four-Power Anti-German Pact proposed by the United States. The Austrian issue has been handed over to the special representatives of the four foreign ministers for discussion. The representatives appointed by each foreign minister are as follows: Dodge of the United States, Marjorie Pinks of the United Kingdom, General Chilier of France, and Koktomov of the Soviet Union.

"Associated Press, London, 26th" A debate occurred at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference today. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov accused Western countries of hindering the conclusion of the German peace treaty, intending to enslave small and weak nations with imperialism, and intending to manipulate the German economy to cultivate its military potential. British Foreign Minister Bevin replied, "We are clearly all war profiteers, and the only saint in the world is the Soviet Union." French Foreign Minister Bidault said that Mr. Molotov's words were unlikely to contribute to harmony. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall also replied in a short speech, saying, "Mr. Molotov probably does not believe his own words. We had better be realistic and not judge others by our own standards. This is just a matter of propaganda. We must immediately start work in a reasonable manner and establish an agreement for the benefit of the whole world." The opening remarks of the second day of the conference thus came to an end.

### Benelux Presents Memorandum; German Issues Closely Related to Their Interests; Four Powers Should Not Make Any Decisions Without Consent

"Central News Agency, London, 26th" The three Benelux countries presented a joint memorandum to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference today, expressing their views on the political and economic future of Germany. The three governments emphasized that the general resolution of the German issue and the special resolution of the Ruhr issue should not be decided by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference without the consent of Benelux. The memorandum emphasized the importance of preventing the use of German economic power to threaten the political balance of Europe and suggested two main strategies: international control of the Ruhr industrial area and the gradual restoration of German political responsibility within the framework of a federal constitution. The three governments demanded the right to participate in the international control of the Ruhr industrial area and demanded the right to attend meetings during the period of international joint management of Germany. The three governments value the security of the three countries, avoiding possible future aggression from Germany, but economically do not want to see a large reduction in Germany's economic capacity, except for typically destructive machinery and raw materials.

### Austrian People Express Relief

"Reuters, London, 27th" After the Four Foreign Ministers Conference placed the Austrian peace treaty as the first item on the agenda, an atmosphere of optimism has permeated Austria. The organ of the People's Party views it as a dawn for Austria and the world, as this development proves that both sides have a willingness to compromise.

### German Communists Plan to Elect Representatives to Present Opinions on the Peace Treaty

[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] The Socialist Unity Party, manipulated by the Communist Party, announced that the "People's Congress" will hold a meeting on December 6th and 7th to elect representatives to attend the London Foreign Ministers Conference on behalf of Germany.

### U.S. Loan Balance to the United Kingdom Unlikely to Be Unfrozen in the Short Term

[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder reportedly said that whether the United States will unfreeze the balance of the loan to the United Kingdom is unlikely to be decided in the next few weeks. A reporter asked if it was true that there would be no action on this issue until Congress resolves the emergency aid to Europe issue. Mr. Snyder declined to comment.

[Associated Press, London, 26th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps confirmed on the 26th that the United Kingdom will soon be able to draw the final $400 million remaining in the Anglo-American loan. However, he said that this matter must wait for the United States to make a statement first.

"This newspaper dispatch" New York, 27th Broadcast: Washington News, the US Senate yesterday rejected cutting $197 million in emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria, but a group of senators opposed giving aid to foreign countries casually and raised various amendments, so the hope of a final vote on Thanksgiving Day has fallen through.

### French Labor Strikes Increasingly Widespread; Workers Reject Government's Wage Increase Plan; Rumors of Communist Attempt to Launch Coup

"Associated Press, Paris, 27th" Prime Minister Schuman is scheduled to report to Parliament this afternoon on how to deal with the labor strikes and request approval, but there are many scheduled speakers, and it is still unknown whether a vote can be held today.

"Associated Press, Paris, 26th" The number of striking workers in France today is close to two million, and there have been sporadic riots in various places. In the northern coal mining strike center of Lerry and in some places in eastern France, strikers and non-strikers have clashed. The general railway strike is already underway. The General Confederation of Labor branch in Alpin town, Annecy Province, has called on all its members in the area to go on strike, which is the beginning of a general strike of all trade unions. Prime Minister Schuman used radio broadcasts to appeal to the strikers to return to work, saying that the present is a difficult period in French history and asking all workers to examine their conscience. He also said that strikers will not be paid during the strike period and said that many of the strikes are for political purposes. Mr. Schuman promised striking workers in Paris an immediate temporary increase of 1,500 francs (approximately US$12) per month to cope with the high cost of living. The strikers demanded a minimum wage increase of US$32 per month. The 18 trade unions belonging to the General Confederation of Labor immediately rejected the government's proposal, and 21 other trade unions must hold meetings to decide whether to accept the conditions or join the strike.

"Associated Press, Paris, 26th" Striking workers in Lyon, France, held a large demonstration on the 26th and were dispersed by police with tear gas. There are widespread rumors that the Communist Party plans to use the labor strikes as a springboard to seize power. It is rumored that 30,000 French standing troops have been recalled to the country from Germany and North Africa in the past week and stationed in Paris, Marseille, Lerry, Lyon, and other centers of turmoil. It is rumored that troops in the Rhineland are preparing to move out immediately, and the border guards have sealed off the French-Spanish and French-Italian borders to prevent the possible infiltration of new "international teams." U.S. Ambassador Caffery visited Mr. Schuman at the Prime Minister's Office at 5 PM on the 26th. Mr. Schuman's duty officer said that this was a "normal visit and had no political significance."

### France and the Soviet Union Sign Barter Agreement; Soviet Union Will Ship Large Quantities of Grain to France

### Truman's Anti-Inflation Measures: Republicans Still Oppose; Martin Indicates Tax Cut Bill Will Be Reintroduced

"Associated Press, New York, 26th" Since the "Marshall Plan battle" began in Congress on the 17th of this month, its lineup has become very clear, namely that this case is a dispute over strengthening government control versus reducing government control.

Now seeing the Republican-controlled Congress ending various economic and commercial controls with a considerable advantage, the Democratic government's opposition is ineffective, and the matter has come to a conclusion; however, the Economic Advisory Committee's report to President Truman has brought up the old issues again. The control measures proposed in the report include the allocation of domestic and foreign supplies, the prevention of speculation, and comprehensive anti-inflation measures to offset extreme needs, which are continued heavy taxation, reduced or expanded credit loans, etc. Some of these measures were abolished by the Republican Congress in the previous session. Republicans are still striving to lift other controls, with the primary goal of reducing individual income taxes. Truman vetoed these twice during the previous session, but House Speaker Martin (Republican) stated yesterday that the tax cut bill will be passed before the Congressional recess in June 1948.

### Japanese Underground Government Incident: Government to Submit Report

### Lin Piao and Ma Bei Purged: Successor to be Decided by Ashida

"New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th" The Central Public Service Examination Committee has formally decided that former State Minister Lin Piao and Ma Bei should be purged. Lin himself only said, "I am not ashamed of my words and deeds," and expressed his unwillingness to say more.

### Palestine Partition Plan Encounters Obstacles at the UN General Assembly: Final Vote Postponed to Today

"Associated Press, Flushing, 26th" The proposal to partition Palestine encountered new opposition in the UN General Assembly today. In a dilemma, supporters of the partition plan finally urged the Assembly to postpone the final vote to the 28th. At the same time, the plan to split the Holy Land into Jewish and Arab states is nearing realization, as the Netherlands and New Zealand announced that they would no longer abstain but intend to vote in favor. The change in the Netherlands' attitude will lead Belgium and Luxembourg to take the same stance.

Meanwhile, New Zealand representative Berendsen announced after the meeting that, to promote harmony, he would change his stance and vote in favor, but Haiti, Greece, and the Philippines simultaneously announced that they would vote against. If Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands unanimously support partition, the UN General Assembly is almost certain to pass the partition plan by a two-thirds majority. The decision to postpone the vote was the result of both sides pressuring undecided delegations outside the meeting. However, the situation in the Assembly is constantly changing, and so far 28 countries have claimed to support partition, and 15 countries have announced that they will vote against. Eleven countries' representatives will deliver speeches before the General Assembly votes on the 28th.

### We Clarify Our Position

"Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th" The Foreign Ministry spokesman made a statement to reporters tonight: "Regarding the UN General Assembly's resolution on the Palestine issue, the Chinese government's policy has been from the beginning that its delegation should support any proposal that can be accepted in principle by both parties in the dispute, and will not support any plan that could cause renewed serious conflict and bloodshed. If the Chinese delegation were not particularly concerned about the wishes of the Jewish people, it would oppose the partition plan. For this reason, the Chinese delegation has been instructed to abstain from voting on this issue, but does not intend to vote against it."

### Siamese Emerald Buddha Diamond Stolen

"Associated Press, Bangkok, 26th" Since the administration of Roong, another shocking incident occurred today: the three-carat diamond inlaid on the forehead of the famous ancient Buddha statue has been stolen. The Buddha is carved from green jade, wears a robe of jewels worth $100,000, and is kept in the Royal Palace temple.

### Japanese Democratic Party Decides to Expel Shidehara Faction from Party

"Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th" The Japanese Democratic Party has expelled former Prime Minister Shidehara Kijuro and 23 other Democratic Party members because they disobeyed the party's decision and voted against the coal mine nationalization bill last night. The expulsion order issued by the Democratic Party this time is generally considered an extremely drastic action, as this move has reduced the Democratic Party to the third-largest party in the parliament.

"New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th" After the fierce struggle over the coal mine bill in the Japanese House of Representatives, the power of various parties has changed. According to the latest statistics, the Socialist Party has 140 seats, the Democratic Party has 126 seats, the Liberal Party has 120 seats, and the National Cooperative Party has 30 seats; if the situation during the vote on the coal mine bill is considered, 24 members of the Democratic Party's Shidehara faction have left the Democratic Party and joined the Liberal Party, then the Liberal Party may become the largest party in the parliament. However, so far, Shidehara and others have not expressed any intention to defect.

"Report from Our Newspaper" According to the results of yesterday's vote count for the National Assembly regional election, Pan Gongzhan still ranks first, followed by Fang Zhi and Qian Dajun, with a difference of only over four hundred votes between the latter two. A total of 49 ballot boxes were opened yesterday, with 22 remaining, of which 3 are Muslim ballot boxes, so there are actually 19 remaining. Most of them are election votes from the Songshan District, so it is expected that Du Yuesheng's vote count will increase sharply today. The remaining votes are scattered and not concentrated, which will not have a decisive impact on the ranking of the leading candidates. Given the current situation, Pan Gongzhan's leading position is almost certainly secured, but the competition for the second, third, and fourth places will still be decided after six hours of counting today.

### Request to Increase Special Treatment Fails; Pilots Suspend Service

"Report from Our Newspaper" The Shanghai District pilotage matters under the jurisdiction of the Jianghai Customs (including pilotage between Shanghai and Outer Tongsasha) involve a total of twenty-two pilots, including twenty foreigners and two Chinese. Pilotage fees have always been calculated in U.S. dollars. Since the government stipulated the exchange rate, settlements have often been made according to the Central Bank's listed exchange rate, but the difference with the black market is very large. The pilots have repeatedly requested, and starting from the first of this month, the Customs stipulated an additional 40% surcharge on pilotage fees. Recently, due to the repeated increase in foreign exchange rates and rising commodity prices, the pilots' livelihoods have been hit again, so they negotiated with the Shanghai District Pilotage Office of the Jianghai Customs, requesting an increase in treatment. The Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs believes that it has only been less than a month since the additional 40% was added on the first of this month, and it is unreasonable to request an adjustment again, which has caused dissatisfaction among all pilots, and they suddenly suspended service starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs immediately discussed with the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and the Maritime Affairs Bureau will find a way to maintain the Shanghai District pilotage issue until it is resolved. According to Yang Lin, from the Shanghai District Pilotage Office of the Jianghai Customs, who told reporters, this matter is not serious and is currently being discussed and will be fully resolved within a few days.

### A Sensation: First Public Trial of Xiao Ling's Suicide Case; Over 700 Spectators Causing a Ruckus

"Report from Our Newspaper" The Xiao Danggui suicide case was publicly tried for the first time in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court at 2:00 PM yesterday. In addition to Zhang Chunfan, who was accused of instigating suicide, Jin Zhaoyuan (Leng Shan), sister Qian Qiongxiao, Chen Delai, Chairman of the Yue Opera Association, Lao Zhennan, shareholder of Hongchang Silk Shop, Liu Tao, screenwriter of Cathay, director Wu Shen, former Cathay actors Fang and Wei Meiyun, Ye Zhicheng, manager of the Central Grand Theater, Shen Yitao, manager of the Queen's Theater, Zhou Mingdao, backstage manager of Cathay, Chen Daqing, manager of Xinda Clothing Store, and Fu Chunlin, manager of Cathay, were also summoned for questioning.

When Zhang Chunfan was escorted in by the bailiffs, the more than 700 spectators who had filled the District Court rioted upon hearing the news, vying for a glimpse. After the bailiffs took Zhang to the small detention room, the Eighth Court locked the gate due to overcrowding before 2:00 PM. At 2:00 PM sharp, Mer and the prosecutor Chen Shoutao and clerk Feng Jianren took the bench. Zhang was wearing a gray wool long robe and Zhigong cloth shoes. The prosecutor first stated the main points of the indictment, stating that Zhang knew that Xiao was in danger of suicide but did not take precautions, and was suspected of instigating suicide.

### Xiao Ling, Only Eighteen Years Old, Came to Shanghai and Made Her Debut

When Zhang was questioned, he stated: 41 years old, from Sheng County. Xiao Danggui was bought from a local opera troupe in Sheng County ten years ago, when Xiao was only eighteen years old. Her first performance in Shanghai was at the Empire Theater. He had a relationship with me at the age of 22, and we secretly lived together across from the East Zhejiang Theater at the age of 24. The following year, Xiao entered the International Theater to perform new-style Yue Opera, and last year she established the Cathay Theater to perform regularly. Question: How did you know that Xiao went to the theater with Leng on October 7th? Answer: "On the night of the 7th, Xiao didn't come home until 11 o'clock. I asked her where she came from. She said she went to see a movie with Mrs. Yu's family. I knew that Mrs. Yu's family was watching a play at Cathay that night, and I had met and talked with her, so how could she be watching a movie? So I pursued where she had gone. She said she went with a small hardware dealer, and they had dinner after watching the movie, so she was late." Question: Had she done this before? Answer: No, but many Yue Opera fans often wrote letters to her. Question: What play did Leng Shan direct later? What was the content? Answer: He directed "The Flower of Anger," which was about a concubine being seduced and committing suicide as a result. Question: Is the situation similar to this case? Zhang lowered his head and did not answer. Question: How did you later know that she went to the movies with Leng Shan? Answer: "Later, I persuaded her with kind words, and she admitted that she went to the movies with Leng Shan and said that she had gone to see them several times before. I said it didn't matter if you went to the movies, but it wasn't good for you to communicate using Liu Qiong's mailbox. On the 8th, I asked Wu Jie to call Leng Shan to confront him."

### Minyi Warehouse: Large Quantities of Goods Sealed Off; Employee Detained for One Day as a Warning for Obstructing Official Duties

When police officers were dispatched to investigate, they were refused by Zhang Junqing, an employee of the warehouse, who reported to the nearby police post No. 77

Minyi Warehouse: Large Quantities of Goods Sealed Off 61, falsely accusing them of being bandits. After the police officers showed their identification and duty certificates, they detained Zhang and immediately conducted a search. As a result, in addition to confiscating a large amount of steel wire and steel plates, they also found newsprint and other materials. According to Zhang, the steel plates, etc., were stored by Minfu Enterprise Company, whose head office is located at No. 316 Jiangxi Road, and the manager is named Zhang Xiaoxian. The newsprint was stored by a certain newspaper office, etc. Currently, the police bureau has temporarily sealed off the above-mentioned materials for disposal and has punished Zhang Junqing with one day of detention for obstructing official duties.

Incidental Event

### Breaking Down the Door: The First Person to Rush in Was Detained for Three Hours

"Report from Our Newspaper" Yesterday, when Zhang Chunfan was tried, there were over 700 spectators, and the court square was filled with them. The Eighth Court could only accommodate 100 people, and those who could not enter made a scene outside the door. The judge then announced a temporary recess. The crowd did not maintain order and broke down the door. The first person to rush in was arrested, sent to a small detention room, and detained for three hours. After Zhang's case was heard, he was temporarily interrogated. This person refused to reveal his name and was ordered to return after being reprimanded. This can be said to be one of the side events.

### At the Court Door, People Surged Like a Tide

After the testimony had lasted for a quarter of an hour, the noise outside the door became deafening, and the pounding on the door was like thunder, making it impossible to continue the trial. A temporary adjournment was announced. The court door was then opened, and the crowd outside surged in like a tide. Judge Mei asked Chief Procurator Zha whether the hearing should be rescheduled. Chief Procurator Zha instructed him to wait a while, and to resume the hearing after some of the crowd had dispersed. They waited until 4:15 PM, by which time most of the audience had left, leaving only one or two hundred people. After assigning more than ten additional bailiffs, the court reopened and continued questioning Zhang Chunfan. Question: What was the purpose of calling Leng Shan to confront you later? Answer: I was afraid that Leng Shan would spread rumors and slander me outside, so I asked Wu Shen and Liu Tao to find him to explain. Question: How did Xiao Pingri contact Leng? Answer: By phone, and also by communicating through Liu Qiong's mailbox, about seven or eight letters.

Crying, a Chaos of Laughter, Big and Small Question: When you saw Leng Shan, what did you mean when you said, "Dan Gui committed suicide"? Answer: No, I said, "Don't you speak. My woman has told me everything. Tell me the truth." Leng then admitted to going to Jinmen with Xiao to see a movie, and later to Zhaofeng Park to play. Finally, Leng Shan lost his temper, and after Leng Shan did as I said, he left. At this point, I cried loudly, Xiao Dan Gui also cried, and Wu Shen and Liu Tao also cried. We all cried together (the courtroom erupted in laughter). On the afternoon of the 13th, I was still talking and laughing with friends, who would have known that she would commit suicide. Question: Did Xiao Pingri usually perform tragedies or comedies well? Answer: She was good at comedies, not so good at tragedies. Question: Do you know the reason for Xiao's suicide? Answer: I think it was because someone said something to provoke her.

Slap Me and Tell Me the Truth When the questioning reached this point, Leng Shan was summoned. Leng was dressed in gray, with a gray face that matched his clothes. He testified: "I am 30 years old, from Suzhou. I am currently an actor at the Shanghai Experimental Film Factory. The first play I directed after joining Guotai was 'This Hatred is Endless'." Question: How did you become acquainted with Xiao? Answer: At first, we were just ordinary friends. Later, because several actors were very ambitious and willing to study acting with me, Xiao Dan Gui was one of them. Question: How did you contact Xiao at the end of September? Answer: At the end of September, I returned to Shanghai from Suzhou. Xiao called me and asked me to talk. I said I was busy these days, but I would be free in a few days. On October 7th, we agreed to go to Dahua to see "Hibiscus Spring," but it didn't work out. Because it was hot, and there was nowhere to go, we went to Zhaofeng Park for a walk. On October 8th, Zhang Chunfan suddenly came to my house to find me and said he had something to discuss. After getting in the car, he said, "Xiao Dan Gui committed suicide." I was very surprised and asked him. Liu Tao said, "Let's talk about it when we get home." When we arrived at Zhang's house, I saw Xiao sleeping on the bed, without any expression. Zhang then said, "Where did you two rent a room yesterday?" I said, "Are you trying to trick me? First you say she committed suicide, and now you say I rented a room with her?" He became furious, slapped me, and told me to tell Wu Shen the truth. After I told him, Xiao also said, "If I am not innocent, I will commit suicide."

You Are Ordinary, I Am Not

Zhang said, "I will only believe it when you die." Xiao cried, and everyone comforted her. I swore an oath, declaring that I had not done anything wrong, and that was the end of it. But Zhang was still angry, saying, "It's not that easy. I want your Bazi (referring to wanting my life)." As I left, I said, "I will never associate with Xiao Dan Gui again." The next day, I returned to Suzhou. Then Liu Tao was called, who testified that on the morning of October 8th, at 10:00 AM, it was raining. Zhang came to find me, saying that Xiao and Leng Shan had a "close relationship," and asked me and Wu Shen to find Leng Shan together. After finding him, we went to Zhang's house. Leng Shan said, "Seeing a movie is a very ordinary thing." Zhang said, "You are ordinary, I am not." He raised his hand to hit Leng Shan, but only touched his hair. Later, Leng Shan apologized and swore an oath to end the matter. On the 9th, 10th, and 11th, I went to Zhang's house. It wasn't until the evening of the 13th that I learned that Xiao had committed suicide. Finally, Shen Yitao, Wei Meiyun, Chen Delai, Zhou Baokui, Lao Zhennan, Zhou Mingda, Ye Zhicheng, Chen Daqing, Fu Chunlin, and others testified. The court then ordered that the case be adjourned for further questioning. Xiao's sister, Qian Qiong Yun, and Wu Shen were both absent from court for various reasons. Before the adjournment, Zhang's lawyer requested bail, but it was denied. Zhang Chunfan was returned to custody.

### Coal Briquettes Allocation Time Pressing, Trade Union Requests Extension Non-Labor Dispute, Social Bureau Refuses to Accept

"Reporting from the News" The Taoist priests of Tongbai Palace, Baiyun Temple, Maoshan Palace, and other temples in this city have been demanding that the temple authorities adjust the treatment for each scripture chanting session, but have not been accepted by the temple authorities. Yesterday, they went on strike and stopped chanting scriptures. Ai Langxuan, the executive director of the Taoist Association, went to the Social Bureau yesterday to request mediation. The Social Bureau stated that the temple masters cannot represent the employers, and the Taoist priests are not employees. This case is not a labor dispute and will not be accepted. The police station should be asked to handle it.

### Over a Hundred Repatriated Overseas Chinese from South Sakhalin Arrive in Shanghai, Food and Accommodation Become a Problem Overseas Chinese Affairs Agency Lacks Funds. The Mayor Agrees to Provide a Week's Supply

"This newspaper reports" The Soviet ship "Gogol" brought 161 repatriated overseas Chinese, men, women, and children, from South Sakhalin yesterday, about 70 of whom were women and children. Among the women, except for six Chinese women, the others were Japanese wives of the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese do not admit that there are Japanese among them, because they have already joined Chinese citizenship. An old Shandong man with a Japanese accent said: "We don't want wives who don't want to be Chinese or come to China. These have always been with Chinese." In addition to the Shandong villagers, most of them are overseas Chinese from Zhejiang and Fujian. Most of them were very poor in the past, and they fled abroad alone. Some sold cloth, some worked, some farmed, and some opened restaurants. Slowly, they accumulated some savings and started families locally. The oldest has lived there for more than 30 years, and the youngest has lived there for more than ten years. For decades, they have been living under Japanese rule. However, it is said that the Japanese treated them well, giving them the freedom to do business and not bothering them too much, but they were not allowed to return to their country. Especially those who had wives and children were absolutely not allowed to leave.

After the "Old Maozi" (their name for the Russians) came three years ago, the situation was different. They took away the money, furniture, cattle, and sheep that the overseas Chinese had worked hard to accumulate over the years. However, compared to the Japanese, the Chinese were still lucky, because the "Maozi" soldiers at least did not kill them. They said, "China and the Soviet Union are friendly countries."

The "Maozi" asked the overseas Chinese to work for them, only giving them 15 rubles a day, and they had to take care of their own food and housing, or give them 60 rubles a month and two slices of black bread a day, while rice had to be bought for 150 rubles a liter. In short, they couldn't get enough to eat. One month's wages was only enough to eat for ten days. Women also worked. They took care of foxes for the "Maozi," and fox fur was used to make women's coat collars. An old Fujian man said, "Children over the age of fifteen have to work, and those under fifteen do housework at home." The overseas Chinese children used to attend Japanese schools in South Sakhalin, but now the "Maozi" don't run schools, and the children don't go to school.

Negotiations for Three Years to Escape the Tiger's Mouth

The overseas Chinese did not have any formal organization there, but in the past, during the Japanese rule, there was a Greater China Chamber of Commerce, headed by Lu Changbang. Another person named Wang Dingxian, who was engaged in well business there, was a leader. All the overseas Chinese gathered together three times a year to eat, drink, and be merry. This time, both of them are representatives of the repatriation group, leading other overseas Chinese back to their country. Speaking of returning to their country, this is really a history of struggle for them. For many years, they wanted to return to China, but under the rule of the powerful rulers, they always failed. This time, they were able to escape the tiger's mouth because the Chinese consul negotiated with the Soviet authorities for three years before they achieved their goal. Finally, except for four or five people, all of them returned. But in North Sakhalin, there are still more than 300 overseas Chinese living in pain, and they don't know when they will be able to return to their embrace!

When asked what they would do after they came back, their answers were mostly a smile, or "We'll see later!" Maybe they are still full of hope. But in fact, they don't know that they are homeless wanderers who have no one to help them—this matter was originally notified by the Soviet side to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was transferred to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the Shanghai Office has no money at all, and the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also has no funds. The relief affairs of the General Administration have also ended long ago. As a result, the representative of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office requested the mayor, and fortunately, the mayor agreed to provide a week's supply, but what about after that? At least for now, there is no solution. Not only is there no solution for the future, but there is also no place to live yesterday. "With no relatives and no money, the Gogol" is parked in the center of the Huangpu River. The stevedores' estimate for carrying the luggage of this group of people ashore is about 6 million, who will pay for this? The agent of the "Gogol" shipping company refused to pay. This group of more than 100 poor refugees had already spent seven days on the ship, but last night they could only spend another night on the ship blowing the sea breeze. And if they still have nowhere to go today, they can only sleep on the streets. Because the "Gogol" will sail back to Vladivostok tomorrow, and the Russians want to disinfect the ship first. And all they brought this time, besides a few rags and quilts, was no money at all. Before they returned to their country, the Russians were not allowed to take money out of the country, and they handed over the little money they had left to the Chinese consulate, which will be returned to them by the Chinese government after negotiating with the Soviet side in the future. The person in charge of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office went to investigate yesterday to see if there were any relatives and friends of the overseas Chinese in the country who could be sent away immediately, but there were none. There was an old lady who was the only one to pick up guests, but as a result, none of these people were Jian's relatives. They have been away from home for decades, and there has been no news for a long time. I don't know where to find relatives and friends. There is also a woman on the ship suffering from meningitis. Fortunately, Wen Songling from the External Affairs Office in Shanghai and Zheng Luyi from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office managed to bring her ashore first and send her to the epidemic hospital. As of yesterday afternoon, there was no solution to the food and accommodation for the other 160 people today, tomorrow, or in the future. It depends on the enthusiasm of these few people to run around and try to find a way overnight.

### Coal Briquette Allocation Time Pressing General Trade Union Requests Extension

"This newspaper reports" Workers in the coal and firewood industry, the white iron industry, and the woodworking industry have been requesting the General Trade Union to find a solution because the time limit for the allocation of coal briquettes to workers stipulated by the People's Food Allocation Committee is too pressing, and all the stipulated procedures cannot be completed in time.

### Hong Kong "Dregs" Politicians Show Their True Colors as Doctors Accusing Prostitutes and Good Women of Being Equal

"A report from our Hong Kong correspondent on the 20th" After the China Democratic League (CDL) announced its dissolution in the mainland, its "CDL Southern Headquarters" in Hong Kong became even more active. Peng Zemin, the person in charge of the CDL Southern Headquarters, hung up a sign that read "National Doctor Peng Zemin" in a small building on Belcher's Street, a quiet corner of Hong Kong, and his talent became known to the world. He is 71 years old this year, which shows that he is already very old. The location of the CDL Southern Headquarters is actually Qingshan, Kowloon. In a large villa there (belonging to Cai Tingkai's property), they added a "Dada College" to step up the training of new cadres. The president is Chen Qiyuan. The main speakers include Deng Chumin, Qian Jiaju, Chen Shisheng, Huang Yaomian, and others.

Using Cai Tingkai's Property

Before the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, Chen and Peng were both executive committee members of the Second Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. However, among the opposition figures who live in Hong Kong, Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai are the most noteworthy. Li and Cai are still in Hong Kong. Li recently met with a reporter from a certain Hong Kong newspaper (namely, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily) to talk about modern Chinese history. He said that his current life in Hong Kong is maintained by the monthly rent of 80 million yuan from a house he owns in Nanjing. He is very interested in going to the United States. It is said that his application for one million US dollars in foreign exchange has not yet been approved by the Standing Committee. He has a son and a daughter in the United States. He lives in Robinson Road, a wealthy residential area in Hong Kong. The house is self-owned and quite spacious. Cai Tingkai has a lot of property in Hong Kong and can be called "second to none" among the opposition figures.

Enjoying Donations While Sitting

There are Cai's houses in Shan Cun Road, Robinson Road, Fung Fai Terrace, Morrison Hill Road, and Kowloon Tong. It is said that there are more than 50 new Western-style houses. He is still eating the donations from the people of the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance. It is said that he is very busy every day. He, Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Chen Shuren (son of Chen Weizhou, nephew of Chen Jitang), and others have formed a "Democratic Promotion Association." Whether it is the CDL Southern Headquarters or the "Democratic Promotion Association," their "organ newspaper" in Hong Kong is the Wah Kiu Yat Po, which shouts against the government every day.

Scaring the Nurse Misses

Another interesting thing is that the Hong Kong police arrested good women, treating them as "streetwalkers." This incident has caused a stir throughout the island. At about 8:45 p.m. on the 16th, three young ladies ran out of the cafe of the Hong Kong Hotel, a gathering place for upper-class figures in Hong Kong, and were stopped by a policeman, who insisted that they were streetwalkers and wanted to take them back to the police station. In fact, they were all nurse misses. Although they explained their identities, the police did not understand and did not allow them to "make a phone call to find someone to guarantee." Later, someone helped them call the doctor at the clinic where they worked. The doctor drove them to the police station in person before they were released. After this incident, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily said, "Streetwalkers have now become a special name in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong police can arrest women on the street by virtue of this special name... We really think that the Hong Kong police have violated the British Constitution's 'right to protect the freedom of the human body'!" The New Life Evening Post advocated severely punishing the policeman who caused the "extremely serious problem." The English South China Morning Post believes that the word "loitering" is difficult to have an appropriate scope, and also advised the police to respect human rights. In the future, if they want to arrest "streetwalkers," they should only do so after "sufficient warning."

The Unfortunate Ones Give Up the Lawsuit

The three unfortunate ones, Tan Wei, Hai Shiyun, and Cen Ruiqing, wrote a letter to the Hong Kong and Macao Women's Movement after the incident, saying, "This kind of indiscriminate arrest of good women not only tarnishes the reputation of all female compatriots in Hong Kong, but also makes everyone feel insecure in their actions, making the entire women's community in Hong Kong like a terror atmosphere," but they finally stated that they did not want to expand the incident and had decided not to sue the police. However, the Chinese and Western women's communities wrote to the Governor of Hong Kong, demanding justice and hoping that similar incidents would not happen again in the future.

Groundless Accusation of Streetwalking

According to this case (the case of the three nurse misses being detained), the same incident happened one night in the past: two ladies, one Zeng Xiyun (her husband used to be a translator for the deputy superintendent of the Hong Kong police), and one Mo Ying (her husband is a foreign paper merchant), were also arrested by the police on groundless accusations of "streetwalking." Mo Ying even spent a cold winter night in the police station. These facts show that the Hong Kong police seem to be overexcited in their public service and have not yet respected the freedom of citizens' bodies! The reporter has previously reported the news that the Hong Kong government has deported two "streetwalkers" for the first time in a century. Whether it is appropriate for the Hong Kong government to deal with prostitutes with such severe means is another matter, but as long as married women and misses with legitimate occupations go out at night, the police arrest them indiscriminately, and accuse them of the same crime as prostitutes.

### Bananas and Oranges Struggle Under Maritime Transportation

"This newspaper's Taipei, 25th airmail dispatch" The production volume of bananas and oranges in Taiwan Province used to rank third among agricultural products. At the peak of exports, there were 3,508,464 baskets of bananas and 298,000 boxes of oranges. If converted to current prices, bananas would be worth 7 billion 合幣(currency) and oranges would be worth about 1.2 billion 合幣.

In the past, the quantity transported to Japan accounted for 85% of the total, while Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Fuzhou, and other places in mainland China accounted for only 15%. Currently, the output of oranges in Taipei, Hsinchu, and Taichung is almost the same as before the restoration. The increased production of bananas in Kaohsiung and Taichung will soon reach the highest figures of previous years. But what about the sales channels? Japan is no longer included. 100% can be transported to mainland China, but due to the restrictions of maritime transportation, the bananas and oranges of this province are suffering a suffocating fate.

In the past, the freight for each basket of bananas from Keelung to Yokohama, Japan, was 1.3 yuan, 9 角 to Moji, and 7.8 角 to Shanghai. Based on the price of bananas at 11 to 14.5 yuan per basket at that time, the freight accounted for only 10% to 15% of the selling price. Now, it costs 1,100 yuan to transport a basket of bananas from Keelung to Shanghai, accounting for more than 50% of the selling price, and 3,000 yuan to Tianjin, accounting for 150% of the selling price. The profits that should be obtained from selling green fruits to other ports are all taken up by freight.

Green fruit merchants in this province are mostly calling for: reducing maritime transportation costs, improving transportation technology, and hoping to value these special products as much as rice, wheat, and flour, because they are indeed a vital force for this province's industry to strive for exports.

"Another dispatch" Li Chuanlong, an entomologist who collected butterfly specimens in Taiwan, has recently finished his collection work and is preparing to return to Shanghai. Mr. Li came to Taiwan on June 1st and went alone to Yushan, Wushe, central and southern Taiwan, and the eastern Huoshao Island, Red Head Island, Penghu and other places. He collected specimens on the desolate Red Head Island for as long as seven weeks. During the war, he traveled all over the southwestern provinces. After the victory, he became a professor of entomology at Xinjiang College and traversed the Tianshan and Pamir Mountains. Over the past twelve years, he has completed the collection of specimens from eighteen provinces across the country. He has collected a total of 800 species of butterflies, and this time he has collected more than 90 species in Taiwan. According to Mr. Li: Fifty years ago, the British entomologist Leech came to China to collect special butterflies, only 594 species. The Japanese began collecting butterflies in Taiwan in the 18th century, a total of 56 species. Currently, he has collected 800 species. Although it is impossible to discover new species in Taiwan, he has already exceeded 36 species. He is very satisfied with the environment for collecting specimens on the island. There were no fierce beasts discovered in the mountains. However, it is necessary to overcome the invasion of malaria and Red Head bug germs. He plans to return to Shanghai and immediately engage in sorting. After completing the collection of the Dongsha and Xisha Islands and western Yunnan, he can respond to the invitation of the Entomological Society of China to hold a public exhibition and complete a monograph on "Butterflies." According to Mr. Li is one of the leading entomologists in China, and his spirit of devoting himself to science and studying hard is admired by the public. (Special correspondent Jiang Muyun)

### Yang'e Creek White Otter Treasure of Valuables

"This newspaper's Wuyuan, 20th dispatch" Yang'e Creek in Kaiwen Township, north of the county, is surrounded by mountains and water, with shaded trees. It is a scenic and secluded area in the township. Otters are produced in the nearby mountains and forests from time to time. Whenever the cold frost falls lightly, otters begin to appear on the banks of the creek to catch and eat river fish. Otter hunters often check the traces of the otters in the frequent, familiar paths during the cold, frosty, windy mornings and moonlit evenings, and use bamboo bows to set up traps. When the otter passes by, it steps on the trigger and the bow is released, occasionally catching it by its feet.

Yesterday, the otter hunter Wang Chen told reporters: A white otter, a rare and precious species among otters, one in a hundred, was recently discovered on the bank of the creek. This otter is extremely mysterious in its movements. In the hazy moonlight, one can only glimpse its color and shadow, and it is impossible to catch it. After waiting for a long time, it does not appear. He said with great cherish.

He also said: Otters belong to a kind of beast. They often hide in the mountains and come out at night to eat fish. This county has many mountains and clear rivers, which are good places for otters to live. There are very few otters near the water in the plains without mountains. Otter hunters value their skins, which are searched for by fur merchants from Beijing and Hangzhou every year for a lot of money. The selling price is often ten to a hundred times that of other animal skins, especially white otters, which are even more priceless treasures. (Special correspondent Yu Ningpo)

### Zhenjiang Peach Case Tian Girl Hanging Herself Seeking Death

This newspaper's Zhenjiang, 26th dispatch" On the afternoon of the 25th, a similar桃色(scandalous) hanging suicide case occurred at the Second Branch of the Provincial Police Bureau. The reason is that a girl Tian from Jiangdu (26 years old, residing at No. 133 Jianzi Lane) came to Zhenjiang three years ago to avoid the chaos and lived in the home of her aunt and uncle Huang Jiliang (i.e., No. 133 Jianzi Lane). According to her: In March of this year, she had a relationship with Huang Jiliang. He wanted me to be his concubine, and I agreed.

### Taiwan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry Plans Economic Afforestation

"This newspaper's Taipei, 23rd airmail dispatch" Because Taiwan has high mountains above 3,000 meters, it has a strong 30% forest resource. In the past, the Japanese actively implemented construction, and the demand for materials was urgent. Every year, it still needed to import one hundred tens of thousands of stones. Later, it opened up broad-leaved forests and increased production by 500,000 stones, but it still needed to import millions of stones. Until the end of the war, in order to supply military needs, the annual felling reached two million right, an area of about 20,000 hectares, and the material could not. It has reached, and now it fells more than 11,000 hectares a year, which is more than the area of afforestation.

Indiscriminate felling of forests makes people painfully feel that in five or ten years, more than 70% of the mountains and forests in this province will become barren mountains, and even more directly damage farmland. Recently, Luodong in eastern Taiwan suffered continuous rain for 20 days, and the water source rose sharply. Because the slope was at 401, it was impossible to quickly discharge the water, so the dike collapsed and flooded, and the houses were in ruins. Some say that this is the result of indiscriminate deforestation, but the rise and silting of the riverbed are also the main reasons.

Xu Qingzhong, Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, plans to focus on timber wood, camphor forests, fuelwood forests, and tropical special tree species, and compile a large economic afforestation plan to afforest more than 123,000 hectares of mountainous land in five years, requiring 46 million seedlings. He said that at present, afforestation is not only a financial and technical problem, but also a problem of ideology. He is now drafting a plan to reward the whole province's 300, theives stealing, two sides.

Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau thinks that Taiwan's congenital conditions are not enough, so there are artificial hydroelectric agricultural irrigation projects. As far as dikes are concerned, there are 470,000 meters in the whole province, and 40,000 meters need to be repaired urgently. Last year, the Public Works Bureau repaired 17,000 meters, and 19,000 meters were destroyed in June. This year, it is requested to repair 20,000 meters, but because the provincial car has no money, only 8,000 meters can be repaired. If it cannot be sorted out year by year, the fate of the 9 million mu of fields on which it depends for planting will be very pessimistic.

Taiwan's forests, dikes, rivers, and irrigation are closely related to the development of the industry. After inspecting Taiwan, Weng Wenhao told reporters that it is a terrible phenomenon to cut down forests for charcoal and change the right to banana plantations. This forest resource does need our preciousness and maintenance.

### Japanese Textbooks Distort Facts; Chinese and Soviet Representatives Unanimously Criticize; General Shang Zhen Urges Allied Headquarters to Provide Reasonable Guidance

"Central News Agency Tokyo, 26th dispatch" This morning, Chinese and Soviet representatives in the Allied Council for Japan strongly criticized Japanese school textbooks, saying that they contained many distortions of facts and the poison of military education. The Chinese and Soviet representatives responded to the statement made by the British representative Mr. Xiao at the last meeting. Mr. Xiao said that Japanese history textbooks are still imperfect, and some paragraphs have secret purposes, and others can unfortunately remind people of Japanese propaganda before and during the war. General Shang first mentioned the basic reform of the Japanese education system, and in view of the deep-rooted 武主义 (militarism) and extreme nationalism in the Japanese education system, he urged the headquarters to provide reasonable guidance and strict supervision, and the committee should also provide constructive suggestions. Mr. Shang suggested that bad teachers should be expelled from the education sector and should not be allowed to hold other public positions. He also cited several places from the history book entitled "Progress of the Country" as evidence. He said that the famous Twenty-One Demands were not mentioned, and the textbook's record of the Manchurian Incident and the Lugouqiao Incident was vaguely referred to as the Chinese incident. After Mr. Shang finished his speech, the Soviet representative Kesslenco stood up in support. Mr. Kesslenco continued to point out some examples of distorted propaganda from the same book. When describing the Russo-Japanese War, it said that Russia 作 (created/manufactured), thus the Korean War occurred. Mr. Kesslenco said that various textbooks made young children think that the annexation of the northeastern provinces of China was purely accidental and not the result of aggression. The book also said that the Chinese army launched a full-scale attack in an attempt to destroy the railways in the Northeast. The new textbooks only whitewash the faults and do not eliminate the distortions of facts. General Shang Zhen also suggested canceling the memorial monuments that marked military exploits and strictly controlling the bad activities of young people.

### Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee Official States: Black Market Exchange Rate is Abnormal. Newly Set Exchange Rate is Quite Beneficial to Exporters.

"Our News" An official from the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee told reporters yesterday: Since the recent exchange rate adjustment, the situation of export exchange settlement has been quite good. In general, exporters believe that the current market exchange rate set by the Committee is in line with reality. It has been able to take into account the costs of exporters. The black market exchange rate has lost its normality and is no longer reliable. If we measure the intrinsic purchasing power of our country's currency with the currencies of various countries, we can know the rationality of the current exchange rate set by the Stabilization Committee.

"Another Dispatch" Recent rumors have been spreading that the government will change its foreign exchange policy and abolish the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. Yesterday, reporters specially inquired with Chen Guangfu and Shen Xirui, the chairmen of the Committee. They said that the government has not considered this, and everything is just a rumor. Regarding the fluctuations of the black market foreign exchange, Chen said that it is "not reliable" because the market exchange rate has little connection with the black market. Shen also said that exporters have benefited a lot from the recent market price adjustment, and generally, export goods can be exported, and the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese has also increased. However, they disagreed with the suggestion that the market exchange rate should be raised to exceed the black market to suppress the black market. They believed that this method would mean competing with the black market.

### Seeking to Suppress the Rising Trend of Cotton Cloth: The Textile Control Committee Decides to Allocate Cotton Yarn. The National Bank Agrees to Allocate 30,000 Bales of Foreign Cotton Without Permits.

"Our News" According to the Textile Control Committee: The recent sharp rise in yarn prices is mainly due to the high price of raw cotton, which has increased costs. To suppress the market price of cotton yarn and cloth, the Committee has obtained the approval of General Manager Zhang of the National Bank to allocate 30,000 bales of foreign cotton without permits to the Textile Control Committee for distribution to various yarn mills to spin cotton yarn on their behalf. This will prevent the mills from competing to purchase cotton on the market and raising cotton prices, thereby achieving the effect of suppressing the market price of yarn and cloth. Any yarn mills that have previously contracted with the Committee for processing, have a good reputation, and are indeed short of cotton, can apply to the Committee for cotton allocation. The allocation method is still under discussion.

Yarn Prices Increase

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to soar. Purchases from Tianjin and Guangdong continued to be smooth, and outside procurement was strong.

The standard for depositing funds is to meet the actual needs of remittance.

A portion of the allocated artificial silk should be designated for overseas silk sales, exporting to earn foreign exchange. Detailed implementation measures will be formulated by the three ministries of Agriculture, Economy, and Finance.

### "Medical Disputes" - Past and Present Excerpts from the Author's Speech at the Medical Association

— Wang Juerong

Chairman, distinguished officials, honored guests, esteemed seniors,

In the past year, the number of medical disputes has broken all previous records. From January 1st to today (November 16th), in less than a year, there have been more than 30 medical lawsuits in Zhejiang and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai. The number of cases that were resolved through mediation without going to court is several times higher than this. In Shanghai alone, in the first ten days of November (1st to 12th), there have been three formal medical disputes, averaging one every four days. The two deputy general managers, Qu Jiang, and I, have been serving this association and have spent dozens of hours on this matter alone in these twelve days. If this continues, not only will the association's staff be exhausted, but all members will feel a sense of panic and trepidation. If this trend does not stop, no one will dare to perform surgery or handle difficult childbirths, and even important injections will be difficult to administer. This will directly affect the development of members' careers, and indirectly endanger patients' lives and social stability. A century from now, it will deter young people from studying medicine, leading to a decline in the overall health of the nation. Having recognized this, I feel compelled to speak out. I will present a concise analysis and statistics of the dispute materials I have collected in Beijing and Hangzhou over the past two months, so that judicial authorities and the public can understand the origins of the disputes and make informed judgments. Members of our association can also understand their own weaknesses and be vigilant. Finally, I will attach a plan to eliminate medical disputes for the assembly to discuss. I am not well-versed in these matters, and my words may not carry much weight, but I hope that all seniors will offer guidance on this vital issue!

Analysis and Statistics of Cases:

(I) Classification by Department:

14 cases of disputes arising from internal medicine or injections, accounting for 47%

9 cases of disputes arising from surgery or anesthesia, accounting for 30%

5 cases of disputes arising from difficult childbirth, accounting for 16.4%

1 case of dispute arising from electrotherapy, accounting for 3.3%

1 case of dispute arising from otolaryngology, accounting for 3.3%

(II) Age Classification of the Deceased: 15 adult males, accounting for 50%; 9 adult females, accounting for 30%; 6 minors and children, accounting for 20%.

(III) Family Status Classification: Wealthy, accounting for 5%; upper-middle class, accounting for 10%; middle class, accounting for 25%; impoverished, accounting for 60%.

(IV) Family Occupation Classification: Difficult to collect materials, not disclosed for the time being!

(V) Classification of Case Development:

19 cases dismissed without prosecution, accounting for 62.8%

6 cases prosecuted but acquitted, accounting for 20.2%

1 case sentenced guilty in the first instance but acquitted on appeal, accounting for 3.4%

1 case sentenced guilty in the first instance and currently on appeal, accounting for 3.2%

3 cases under trial with unknown results, accounting for 10.2%

(VI) Classification of Reasons for Prosecution: 8 cases of negligent homicide; 1 case of desecration of a corpse; 1 case of death due to delayed treatment; 1 case of negligent homicide by an assistant.

Exploration of the Causes of Disputes: A. From the Patient's Family:

1. Emotional factors of the patient's family members.

2. The natural trend of social and economic collapse.

3. The consequences of the negative impression of a small number of hospitals and doctors on the outside world.

B. From the Doctor:

1. The doctor's lack of understanding of the national situation (e.g., requesting an autopsy from the deceased's family, leading to a dispute).

2. The doctor's lack of legal knowledge (assuming that the doctor is not responsible because the patient or family has signed a consent form).

3. Insufficient kindness towards the patient's family before the incident.

4. Lack of understanding of the patient's family's psychology (extreme sympathy should be shown to the family after the patient's death).

5. A very small number of colleagues charge too high fees and require prepayment, creating a bad impression of taking advantage of others' distress.

C. From Third Parties:

1. The cumbersome nature of hospital procedures.

2. The poor attitude of a small number of office staff.

3. Excessive insistence on prepayment of fees before admission or surgery.

4. Malicious instigation by colleagues or similar professionals.

5. Encouragement from well-meaning neighbors and relatives of the patient.

The Current Handling of Medical Disputes by the Legal and Media Sectors:

1. The prosecutor's and judge's free evidence collection system does not require complete acceptance of the forensic doctor's opinion. In addition to forensic doctors, the court does not have a provision for hiring other experts as "expert witnesses."

2. Signing a surgical consent form does not exempt liability for gross negligence under Article 222 of the Civil Code for dangerous diseases, except for minor negligence. Therefore, the patient's or family's signature only constitutes an agreement to the risks of the surgery.

3. News reporters often publish articles such as "incompetent doctor kills" out of sympathy for the unfortunate experiences of the deceased's family, causing a negative impression of the medical community among the general public. Once these people encounter similar unfortunate events themselves, they can cite previous examples and unhesitatingly take the medical community to court.

Possible Consequences of Medical Disputes:

(I) Because of the possibility of criminal liability at any time, doctors may develop to "see danger and not dare to save" (only seek to enter the yamen (government), not seek to enter the temple (hospital)). For example, those who could have injected will use oral medications instead, or surgeons may be afraid to operate on cases where there is still a glimmer of hope to avoid responsibility and let the patient develop!

(II) Because of the possibility of being declared bankrupt at any time (e.g., the case of civil compensation of 75 million yuan), doctors with some wealth may give up medicine and enter politics or business. The already insufficient number of doctors will decrease further.

(III) Young students go from elementary school to middle school, from preparatory courses to specialized schools, studying hard for many years. Before obtaining their medical qualifications, 60-70% are eliminated due to physical fitness, intelligence, or economic reasons! Those who are fortunate enough to obtain a medical degree receive very little compensation (before the war, a resident doctor's monthly salary was 100 yuan, which was quite comfortable, but now their monthly income is only several hundred thousand yuan, barely enough to make ends meet!). Their lives are also very monotonous (working day and night, spending all day with distressed patients)! In addition to the heavy responsibility, although they are constantly cautious, walking on thin ice, unwarranted charges can still be imposed on them at any time due to misunderstandings by the patient's family. Once the news of an incompetent doctor killing someone is published, decades of reputation and effort are wasted. Even if they are acquitted later, their reputation is ruined and it is difficult to turn the tide! In this situation, doctors' children will not study medicine. In fact, why would children who are not from medical families spend several years and nearly a hundred million yuan to study medicine and throw themselves into a trap? The highest authority's plan to train 100,000 doctors in five years, as stated in China's destiny, will inevitably suffer the greatest blow as a result, and the nation's health, future, and various nation-building plans will inevitably be significantly affected. This is what I cannot bear to tell the community.

Medical Disputes in England, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union:

Although I enjoy studying law, I only have a superficial understanding. Before writing this section on the laws of various countries, I consulted Dean Peng of the Law School of Aurora University for three hours and visited many judges, prosecutors, forensic doctors, and legal experts. Therefore, what is written in this section is a synthesis of the instructions of various experts. If there are any omissions, I hope that the experts will correct them. I would also like to thank Dean Peng and all the experts here!

(I) England Adopts a System of Expert Jurors: Medical disputes are rare in England. If one occurs, the court generally invites experts from local medical colleges and medical associations to participate in the jury. When making a judgment, the experts vote to determine guilt or innocence, and then the judge pronounces the sentence.

(II) The United States Has an Accidental Insurance System: Parts that are sued mostly ask for civil compensation. Few file a doctor's criminal number toward the insurance company holding "Business Accidental" insurance. (The method is the same as car accidental insurance.) If an accidental dispute occurs, the insurance company is responsible for legal litigation and compensation!

(III) The System of Expert Identification in France and the Soviet Union: Generally, when local courts encounter medical disputes, the presiding judge and prosecutor appoint one or more experts from the local experts as "expert witnesses" to review whether the doctor is at fault. The result of their identification can sway the judge's judgment. The expert must also make a pledge before the identification, stating that "a fair and honest identification must be made" to show fairness!

How to Eliminate Disputes Permanently?

(A) What Each Member is Expected to Do:

(1) Value the sacred mission of the profession and not change careers or have a "see danger and not save" mentality due to one or two disputes.

(2) The attitude towards patients should be absolutely kind.

(3) Do not charge too high fees, and reduce or waive fees for the poor and sick.

(4) Study legal knowledge related to the medical community.

(5) Understand the patient's psychology and understand the national situation.

(6) Continuously improve their knowledge through further study.

(7) Do not make casual remarks or intentionally or unintentionally slander colleagues.

(8) Members responsible for managing hospitals should strive to change the attitude of medical staff and clerks towards patients.

(B) What this Association is Expected to Do:

(1) Promote medical ethics to members and introduce to the community the truth about the service of this association members to society (the total number of people diagnosed and treated free of charge by all members of this association each year is quite large, but the outside world does not know the truth because there is no comprehensive statistics).

(2) Hold legal lectures to instill legal knowledge in members.

(3) Provide legal relief to members.

(4) Create a "mock court" to study whether members are at fault. Those who are guilty will not be defended, and those who are innocent will be supported.

(5) Join forces with medical associations across the country to request the legislative authorities to amend the Doctors Law and petition the judicial authorities to request improvements to the medical dispute trial procedures and compensation for unjust imprisonments.

(C) What is Hoped for from the Public:

(1) It is hoped that the media will not casually publish articles with titles that harm the reputation of doctors, such as "incompetent doctor kills," before a dispute has been adjudicated.

(2) It is hoped that colleagues in the legal community will sympathize with the medical community and provide guidance when parties make unreasonable demands!

(3) It is hoped that the insurance industry will offer "professional accident insurance" to protect doctors' civil liability.

(4) It is hoped that the patient community will sympathize with the difficult and sacred mission of doctors and not, as the fabulists say, "regard doctors as angels when treating diseases, regard doctors as devils when paying bills, and regard doctors as creators when patients unfortunately die." This will reduce many unnecessary disputes.

(D) What is Hoped for from the Legislative, Judicial, and Administrative Authorities:

(1) It is hoped that the Ministry of Education will increase the budget for national medical education and improve the equipment and training of teachers in medical colleges, medical, pharmaceutical, obstetrics, nursing, and other specialized schools. To achieve the five-year plan for the highest authorities to create medical personnel, medical schools should be established in the mainland to improve the quality of doctors while simultaneously improving their quality, and to achieve the "public medical system" as soon as possible.

(2) It is hoped for at the Ministry of Health:

A. To protect people's lives, special care should be taken in issuing doctor's licenses. However, once issued, the doctor's business should be adequately protected, and the revocation of a doctor's license should be very careful.

B. A short-term training of medical personnel who barely pass the screening or are not far below the passing score should be added, and they should be assigned to public hospitals and clinics for practical experience at the time. After the results are permitted, they are assigned to the areas in urgent need of doctors but without doctors, and work for a considerable period of time. Then they are given a license to allow them to practice freely, in order to show the best of both worlds!

C. The public medical system should be promoted in districts year by year, so that the poor and sick have treatment, and the society's condemnation of doctors can be reduced (because doctors have to maintain their own and their family's lives, they cannot provide completely free service to patients).

D. Some laws and regulations should be amended: "Example 1" Midwives are not allowed to deliver babies alone before graduating, but the regulations of the Ministry of Education stipulate that midwives should have had at least several times of delivering babies alone before graduation in order to graduate.

"Example 2" Those without a doctor's license are not allowed to perform intravenous injections. This is a good intention, but most of the resident doctors in major hospitals are sixth-year students of various medical colleges and do not have a license. If they are not allowed to inject, they will never have the opportunity to learn. If they are allowed to inject, and unfortunately a dispute arises, their professors will take the blame for them. Therefore, in order to seek the soundness of medical education, a win-win strategy should be sought.

(3) It is hoped for the Legislative and Judicial Authorities:

1. Traditional Chinese medicine and new medicine have different systems and methods. It is inappropriate to try to regulate them with the same Doctor Law. As for how the Doctor Law should be amended, a special committee of this association is discussing it and will submit another article for discussion.

2. Medical dispute cases should preferably adopt the UK's "expert juror system." At the very least, all courts in the country should be ordered to respect the opinions of forensic doctors. In addition, they should follow the example of France and invite experts such as doctors, medical associations, and medical associations from local medical colleges as "expert witnesses." The judgment of the case should respect the opinions of the expert witnesses (it is heard that Article 189 of the Criminal Procedure Law already has a "expert witness system").

3. Compensation for unjust imprisonments system: In recent years, the judicial community has been promoting it. In view of the losses suffered by members of this association in the past, this "compensation for unjust imprisonments" or "counter-accusation" system should be promoted as soon as possible.

(4) It is hoped for the Ministry of Interior or the Information Bureau:

In order to protect the rights and interests of the personnel of this association, it is requested that all newspapers and publications across the country be notified to be careful not to publish titles that harm the reputation of doctors, such as "incompetent doctor kills," before the third trial is adjudicated.

If the above points can be gradually realized through the cooperation of all parties, then medical disputes may be eliminated permanently. We are willing to work together with the members of this association to achieve this goal. If approved by the general meeting, we are willing to make a proposal to the National Federation of Medical Associations in the name of this association, and petition the relevant ministries and departments. With the support of the people, we will succeed in our endeavors. Let us work together.

### The Flourishing Era of "Nepotism"

— Yi Feng

The Han Dynasty is historically known as a "Prosperous Era," and perhaps the era with the most rampant "nepotism" in history was the late Eastern Han. Although the initiator of this practice was the Empress Dowager Xuan, mother of King Zhao of Qin in the distant Qin Dynasty, it was greatly adopted in the Han Dynasty. The reason was that the empress dowager wanted to monopolize power on behalf of her son, the emperor, and feared that employing others would be detrimental to her. Therefore, she appointed her own father and brothers to important positions, creating a situation where the maternal relatives held power.

According to the "Records of the Grand Historian," "When King Zhao ascended the throne, he was young, and the Empress Dowager Xuan personally managed affairs. She appointed her half-brother Wei Ran as general, entrusted him with governance, and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Rang." This was indeed the beginning of empress dowagers' regency in history, and also the beginning of heavy reliance on "nepotism."

In the Han Dynasty, after Emperor Gaozu passed away, Empress Lü came to power. She vigorously cultivated the power of "nepotism," enfeoffing the descendants of the Lü family, such as Lü Zhao, Lü Chan, Lü Lu, and Lü Tong, as kings, breaking the limitation established by her husband: "Anyone who is not of the Liu clan and becomes king shall be executed by all under Heaven." It was not until after Empress Lü's death that the Liu clan raised their heads again. Zhu Linghou Liu Zhang and his clansman Jianghou Bo and others formed a united front, "capturing and executing all the men and women of the Lü clan, regardless of age." They completely eradicated the "nepotistic" power of the Lü family.

Thereafter, those who sought enfeeoffment through "nepotism" were still not lacking in every generation. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, Dou Ying and Tian Fen, who fought each other for favor and ultimately led to each other's deaths, both belonged to the "nepotistic" faction. And the three great generals of the same era, Wei Qing, Huo Qubing, and Li Guangli, who achieved brilliant accomplishments and were successively in great power, also rose to prominence through "nepotism" due to their relationships as brother-in-law and nephew, eventually achieving great success and soaring to high positions. Huo Qubing's younger brother, General Guang, obeyed Emperor Wu's deathbed command, assisted Emperor Zhao, emulated the story of the Duke of Zhou, and acted as the actual emperor. After Emperor Zhao died, he welcomed and enthroned King He of Changyi, but soon deposed him. Then, he welcomed and enthroned Emperor Xuan, and also arranged for his daughter to enter the palace as empress. His power became even greater! Even Emperor Xuan had to fear him. As history says, "When the Emperor first ascended the throne, General Guang rode in the same chariot. The Emperor was deeply afraid of him, as if he had thorns in his back." After Guang died, his sons eventually suffered the great misfortune of clan extermination.

By the time of Emperor Yuan, the "nepotistic" descendants of Empress Wang's lineage gradually became prominent. In the subsequent reigns of Emperors Cheng and Ai, the world became dominated by the Wang family. By the time of Wang Mang, he killed Emperor Ping and openly usurped the throne, transforming the Western Han into the Xin Dynasty. Although that time was very short.

In the Eastern Han Dynasty, after Emperor Zhang, empress dowagers held court and maternal relatives were in power, which became commonplace. As recorded in the "Book of the Later Han, Biographies of Empresses and Consorts": "The imperial lineage of the Eastern Capital was repeatedly severed, and power reverted to the women. Four emperors (An, Zhi, Huan, Ling) were established by maternal relatives, and the empress dowagers held court. All of them made decisions behind the curtains and entrusted affairs to their fathers and brothers. They favored young children to prolong their rule and suppressed the wise and virtuous to monopolize their power." This truly reached an era where "nepotism" reached its peak. As a result, the disaster of eunuchs in the late Han Dynasty was brewed. In the end, "the great fortune declined, and the divine chamber perished." For example, Empress Dowager He of Emperor Ling employed her elder brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, who was a useless person. Wanting to eliminate the eunuchs, he was instead killed by them. Summoning Dong Zhuo led to a situation of warlords vying for territory and the establishment of the Three Kingdoms. Looking at the origin of this "nepotism," it can be said to have been around for a long time. Considering the prevalence of this trend today, why should we be surprised?

### ### The Problem of Eating

— Jiang Duansheng

At this time of expensive rice and firewood, when strict frugality is being practiced, salary earners who can't make ends meet must calculate everything. Clothes can be old and worn, housing can be in attics, travel can be on foot, and even "eating" must be frugal. There's really no choice. I remember that the master of practical learning, Mr. Hu Puan, once said before his death: "If you strictly practice frugality and only eat half a bowl of rice per meal, you won't feel bitter for long!" He was truly a man of determination. Living in today's world, flipping through ancient books, there are records about eating that evoke longing and make one's mouth water:

"The 'Records of the Grand Historian' says that Lian Po met the envoy of Zhao and ate a dou of millet and ten catties of meat to the full. The envoy returned and said that General Xiaokang still liked rice. How true it is that he was good at eating!"

"During the time of Fu Jian of the Qin Dynasty, there was Xia Mo who was the Left Garrison Officer, and Hu Mo who was the Right Garrison Officer. The eunuch Shen Xiangjian was the Fan-Bearer. All three were eighteen feet tall, and they were all strong and good at archery. Every meal, they ate one dan of rice and thirty catties of meat." Compared to Lian Po, they were no less than Chen Shuo compared to dwarfs.

"Wang Wan, the King of Southern Yan, was from Jinan. He was nine feet tall, with a ten-circumference waist. He could ride a horse across the fields without a saddle. Murong De saw his great height and was amazed. He gave him food, and he ate more than one hu. De was surprised and said, 'What he eats is like this. He cannot be satisfied by farming alone. Moreover, his talent and appearance are not mediocre.' He was appointed as the magistrate of Fengling. When he arrived at his post, he governed clearly and achieved great fame, and he was summoned to be the governor of Donglai." If these three were to meet Wang Ying, they would be like a small wizard meeting a great wizard.

"Sun Gong, named Erzun, styled Pingshu, the Governor of Zhejiang and Fujian in the Qing Dynasty, suffered from edema for many years. Recommended by Mr. Bai, Menglu was sent by an official to go to diagnose him. When Menglu arrived, Gong's illness was already incurable. After the diagnosis, he asked how much he had eaten lately. The attendant answered from the side, 'At this time, his stomach qi has changed greatly, and he can only eat seven or eight bowls a day.' Menglu was surprised and said, 'If he eats so much, how can you say that his stomach qi has changed!' The attendant said, 'Sir, you don't know. Compared to what the great man used to eat, it is less than three out of ten!' He then said that when Gong was not ill, he often needed ten pig trotters for a meal, and other things were in similar proportions."

If these people were born in today's world, they would definitely cry out, "Born at the wrong time!"

### ### Three Wishes

— Liu Rong

Feng Yansi, the Chancellor of the Southern Tang Dynasty, has a chapter in Yuefu poetry called "Changming Nu" (Long-Lived Woman):

"Spring day banquet, green wine, a cup, a song, a round. Bowing again, presenting three wishes: First wish, my lord, a thousand years. Second wish, my lady, long-lasting health. Third wish, like swallows on the beam, year after year, forever together."

It depicts the feelings of a virtuous woman, loyal and unwavering, wishing each other well for life, growing old together, year after year, eternally happy, gentle, and affectionate. Its language is rich and graceful. Placing it in the ancient Yuefu collection, it can be without shame.

Also, an ancient poem says: "The day before yesterday, a feast at Zhang's house. Yesterday, a banquet at Wang's house. Today, passing by my humble dwelling, three meetings in three days. Feeling this deep affection, I make three wishes with you: First wish, the world is peaceful. Second wish, long-lasting health. Third wish, in old age, to meet with you often." Reciting this, we see the lofty character of the ancients. Their sincerity and profoundness are unattainable. And the three wishes they express, first, wishing for a peaceful world, is especially realistic in today's world of frequent wars and ongoing conflicts, and can be said to be what the whole country unanimously desires. Second, wishing for long-lasting health, is what everyone aspires to. Third, wishing to meet with you often in old age, in this world where people's hearts are fickle and unreliable, this kind of steadfast friendship that does not fade in old age is especially worthy of emulation. However, living in modern times, should our wishes be limited to the above three?

### ### Nocturnal Gnawing Song

— Sun Yuehan

Knocking, tapping; clanging, clattering. Smashing dishes, gnawing through boxes. The top of the tent is a racecourse, the head of the bed is a bullfighting arena? Squeaking, chirping, still shouting, repeatedly scolding, "This place is the worst!" The soy sauce in the spicy sauce jar is moldy; the oil in the vegetable oil pot is also exhausted. Ancient hatreds and present sorrows burn the heart like fire, precious rice and expensive firewood make people feel pitiful. Awakened from a dream, I hear you talking about love; it prevents me from sleeping in the middle of the night. You should think of the weary working people and grieving wives, working thirteen hours during the day! I scratch my graying temples, forcing myself to open my eyes, patting the edge of the bed, furrowing my brows. Alas, gnawing creatures, gnawing creatures, how cruel you are! Spring, summer, autumn, winter, night after night; my family can't afford a cat, so I let you be rampant all night. Do you see the happy dens in the city that never sleeps, where horses are gambled and people laugh heartily? Business is good, connecting north and south, eating some things doesn't matter! Do you see the wealthy merchants hoarding thousands of dan of grain, their wives and children with rosy faces, piles of money that can't be used up, and golden houses built high along the street? In the midst of calls for frugality, they sleep on their wallets, and life becomes even worse than before. The tuition fee is meager and difficult to make a living on, and a piece of clothing costs millions of yuan!

Note: "Nocturnal gnawing creatures" is another name for mice. "Knocking, tapping" refers to the sound of mice gnawing on things. "Clanging, clattering" refers to the sound of things colliding and falling over. "苟 　" means not having a big style. "Sleeping on their wallets" means being afraid of mice gnawing and damaging them, so they have to do that.

### ### A Few Words on Winter Relief

— Liuyun

On a late autumn night, a cool breeze rustles. Under the lamplight, I read "Miscellaneous Records of Xiqing," and when I reach the section about the old man of Danyang, the benevolent words are so moving that I close the book and sigh three times! As it says, "Whenever it rains or snows, he supports himself with a cane and goes to the field temples, asking the beggars about their sufferings and providing them with porridge for relief. He always tidies up dilapidated houses, expands narrow ones, stores grain, and repairs tools. He often gives things away freely and leaves empty-handed. He said to people, 'Having surplus clothing and rice, how can I bear the cold and hunger of others? It is not the intention of Heaven and Earth to give birth to me. How can my compatriots still be strangers to each other?'"

At this time when disaster victims are gathering in Shanghai and winter relief urgently needs to be carried out, providing clothing and porridge, as well as widely establishing shelters from the cold, are urgent measures that cannot be delayed. According to reports, the funding, in addition to the portion allocated by the government, is far from the actual amount needed, and eagerly awaits the enthusiastic donations of charitable organizations and benevolent gentlemen. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. Although there have been frequent years of war, inflation, and a sluggish economy, there are still not a few who have surplus clothing and rice. If they can slightly restrain their excessive enjoyment and slightly reduce their extravagant spending, and remember the words of the old man of Danyang, showing more compassion and concern, and thinking more about the stability of the entire country and society and about humanity, they will not be reluctant to donate!

### ### West Wind

— Shuxiang

—One of Leisurely Talks in the Sun—

The west wind has come to the human world again!

Of the four seasons, the west wind is naturally the most annoying! The west wind etches out the joys and sorrows of the rich and poor. The rich wear fur robes and woolen shirts, while the poor wear incomplete coarse clothes. "The west wind of snobbery confounds summer," He Hua's minor expresses the pain completely.

But wind is a natural product. Although science has progressed, there is no way to eliminate wind. The tyrannical Qin Shi Huang crossed the river to the Xiang River Temple and encountered a strong wind that almost prevented him from crossing. He asked the scholar what kind of god Xiangjun was. The scholar replied, "The daughter of Yao and the wife of Shun are buried here." Shi Huang was furious and ordered three thousand convicts to cut down the trees of Xiangshan, using the act of cutting down trees to vent his hatred of the wind. How ridiculous!

Dongpo Zhilin records: "A noble young man was drunk in the snow and leaned against the railing, facing the wind and saying: 'How refreshing!' Those around him heard this and some wept. The young man was surprised and asked the reason. They said: 'My father died because of being 'refreshed'!' This is truly a great contradiction between joy and sorrow. The noble young man naturally had a fox fur coat on his body when he leaned against the railing after getting drunk. A gust of west wind refreshed his mind, so it's no wonder he said 'How refreshing!' But the fathers of those around him died because of being 'refreshed.' There are probably many patrons in Shanghai's big restaurants who stand in front of the windows after getting drunk and full, shouting 'How refreshing!' I don't know how many poor people on the streets have died in the sound of 'refreshing.'"

King Xiang of Chu ascended a platform, and a wind blew swiftly. The king said, "How delightful this wind is! Do I share it with the common people?" Song Yu replied, "This is solely the king's heroic wind; how can the common people share it!" In the howling west wind, may the noble young men of today not forget those who died of being "refreshed" after shouting "How refreshing!"

### ### Rule of Law and System

— Zhu Fang

I remember a foreign professor saying, "Rule of law and rule of propriety are just like eating dishes. Rule of law is like eating Western food, with each person getting a portion, and no one can snatch it. You can eat more or less, all within a certain range. Anything outside the range is 'wrong'! Rule of propriety is like eating Chinese food. If everyone is polite, it's especially good. The dishes in the bowls are untouched, and there's still a lot left when you're done. But if someone is impolite, they'll snatch and argue, and even if the bowl is turned upside down, it won't be enough. If things go wrong, there will even be a fight." This is truly a wonderful metaphor.

In short, as long as things are done well, there's nothing that can't be done. Rule of law can "reward the deserving and punish the guilty," while rule of propriety can "make honesty clear and shame known." The results of both can be that thieves do not arise, lost items are not picked up, and outside doors are not closed.

### ### Pity the Parting

— Hulu

According to our Chengdu correspondent, a large group of female thieves has been discovered in Fuling. They have committed many crimes, and it has been impossible to investigate. According to those who have glimpsed them in the moonlight, "They are all lithe young women, wearing headbands and tight-sleeved jackets, moving like snakes on rooftops, disappearing in a flash." This is truly like the so-called flying swordsmen in old novels. Does Sichuan Province still have such people?

It is said that Fuling has many female thieves, skilled at scaling walls and moving swiftly, making it difficult to detect. They strangely dress and move like snakes on rooftops in the moonlight!

Could they be modern female swordsmen, changing styles with the trend: They are base and greedy, stealing from here and there, their consciences dark!

### ### Various Aspects of Iran

— Linlin

Iran has a land area larger than the combined areas of Germany, France, and Italy, making it a large country in the world. However, its population is pitifully small, only between eight million and sixteen million.

In theory, Iran is a constitutional monarchy with a National Assembly. However, in reality, it is a country dominated by two thousand wealthy families. These two thousand wealthy families own the land, and they are the cabinet, and they are the National Assembly. They control the finances and the military; and they allocate most of the national revenue to military expenses, with constitutional police funds accounting for about fifty percent. Therefore, Iran's economic situation is unstable. There is serious inflation, a thriving black market, and unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate.

The King of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, is famous for being romantic. He is only twenty-eight years old this year, with a pale complexion and watery eyes. He grew up entirely in the atmosphere of autocratic dominance in the palace. But he is a docile and kind young man, which is in stark contrast to his barbaric old king. He studied in Europe for five years and is familiar with the etiquette of England, France, and various European countries. He ascended the throne in 1943.

Since the days of Darius and Cyrus, Iran's national power has greatly declined. Its scenery of contrasting mountains and deserts is very beautiful. But only a few of the more than ten million people live in luxury and debauchery; the disparity between the rich and the poor is as vast as heaven and earth. No less than seven million people suffer from syphilis, accounting for about half of the total population; most people smoke opium. Four out of every five children die in infancy; three out of four people are illiterate.

To this day, Iran only has two political parties: the Citizen's Party and the Anti-Sad's National Will Movement Party. The Citizen's Party is pro-Soviet and was formed in 1943 with the support of the Soviet Union. Its members are workers, farmers, intellectuals, etc., and it is active in northern Iran. The National Will Party is supported by Muslims, landowners, and conservatives in Iran and is active in southern Iran. Its foreign policy is pro-British and anti-Soviet. And these two parties have never been able to cooperate, leading to frequent party struggles.

Miss America

### ### Miss America and the Bull

— Xu Shuyuan

Probably because of the influence of the Spanish, many folk customs and habits in the United States cannot escape the brave and fierce nature of the Spanish. To give an example, the Rodeo, which is popular in the central and southern United States, is completely Western European in style, and the word is not English at all. What is called Rodeo is a grand competition of wild bulls and wild horses. Many mountains and forests in the central and southern United States still breed many wild bulls and wild horses. Although they have been captured, they are still difficult to tame and control. Wild bull and wild horse races are held in certain seasons, and the locations are all in the suburbs, because hundreds of acres of open space are needed. Temporary stands and fences are erected. The riders participating in the performance must first register. They are all from far away, like famous artists from north and south in our country, specifically rushing to a certain place to perform. The riders all have ten years of experience. On the day of the performance, the audience buys tickets to enter. The bulls and horses are all numbered. The riders wear colorful and varied costumes, half-high, patterned leather boots, embroidered silk shirts, and felt hats. They are dressed somewhat like the five headmen in Wu Song killing his sister-in-law. Amidst applause like thunder, they ride out on wild horses or wild bulls with smiles. In less than three seconds, the beast has thrown the rider to the ground. If the rider is not thrown off within a certain number of seconds, then the rider has a chance to win the championship. There are also many young ladies among the riders. Although they are beautiful, they are as strong as bulls. They can capture the horns of wild bulls from horseback, shrug and get down, and tie the wild bulls into a ball with hemp ropes. Their strength makes even great men bow down. With their two jade arms, they can knock an ordinary man more than ten feet away. Therefore, when you make friends with a girlfriend in the United States, you must inquire and be clear. If she is a Rodeo contestant, it is best to hide your clumsiness. Otherwise, if you cannot satisfy her, and she kicks you off the bed, you will definitely be in trouble. Miss America usually wears rescue outfits to school and is mostly a skilled horse rider. It is best to eat less tofu. (Ten) (Seven)

To Mr. Wang Zimin: A marriage contract made by your parents on your behalf when you were a minor can be dissolved according to law if you do not agree to it after reaching adulthood. The non-defaulting party may request compensation from the defaulting party for the damages suffered as a result. The Civil Code stipulates that if one party to a marriage contract "has a serious incurable disease" or "has venereal disease or other serious illness," the other party may dissolve the marriage contract.

To Mr. Xu Zhiping: Article 1 of the Criminal Law stipulates: "The punishment of conduct shall be limited to conduct that is expressly prescribed by law at the time of the conduct." Regarding the inquiry, there are no legal provisions to rely on.

To Mr. Zhu Baozhen: It would be very difficult to handle without being able to present supporting documents. Documentary evidence is more powerful than witness testimony. If you have no documents, it is better to adopt other means. It is better to negotiate gently than to demand it forcefully.

To Mr. Wang Liya, Zhangzhu, Yixing: Your two elder sisters should see a doctor and be examined, and take medicine according to the prescription. Do not casually try over-the-counter medicine, so as not to delay the opportunity for treatment. It is difficult to avoid scratching an itch from afar when asking about illness by correspondence. I will not answer the various points you inquired about.

Searching for a Pocket Watch Editor: I lost an old-fashioned gold-cased pocket watch with the description on the right when I took tram number one on Seymour Road at 7:00 am on the fifteenth of this month. Because the watch is a commemorative item, if any benevolent person finds it, please call Tao Jun at 39720 or me at 46423 to discuss it. I am willing to pay a considerable price as a reward. Sincerely yours, Tao Shusen
