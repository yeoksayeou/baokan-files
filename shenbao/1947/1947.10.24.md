### Government Begins Price Controls; Yarn and Cloth Decided on Joint Allocation, to Be Implemented First in Shanghai Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The government has begun to implement price controls, with the first being the control of yarn and cloth. The joint allocation of yarn and cloth will be implemented. The National Economic Council made a comprehensive decision on this at its second meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, and it will be implemented in the Shanghai area starting from the 24th. This control is mainly based on the previously passed development of the textile industry and regulation of yarn and cloth supply. The main points of the implementation plan are as follows: Regarding the price of yarn and cloth, a dynamic and reasonable negotiated price will be implemented according to the plan. Unified purchase of domestic cotton will be implemented according to the plan, and joint price negotiation will be carried out.

The full text of the outline for joint allocation of cotton yarn based on certificates is recorded as follows: The cotton yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn mills, except for the cotton yarn turned over to the government, and that used for military purposes, export, and actual self-weaving needs, should all be jointly allocated in accordance with the method of allocation based on certificates. The cotton yarn entrusted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Textile Adjustment Committee will also be included in the joint allocation. The finished product allocation subcommittee originally established by the Textile Adjustment Committee will be reorganized into the Cotton Yarn Joint Allocation Committee, which will be responsible for handling matters related to cotton yarn allocation based on certificates. For cotton yarn allocation based on certificates, the Joint Allocation Committee should refer to the amount of yarn in storage and pre-determine the total amount of allocation on a monthly basis. The detailed methods for joint allocation should be formulated by the Joint Allocation Committee in accordance with the provisions of Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Chapter 4 of the implementation plan of this council, and reported to the Textile Adjustment Committee for review and transmission to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. This outline will be implemented first in the Shanghai area, and gradually promoted to all parts of the country, and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and the Textile Adjustment Committee will be instructed to implement it as soon as possible.

In addition to approving the joint allocation of yarn and cloth, the National Economic Council also passed the following important proposals: The State-Owned Enterprise Management Law, which has a total of thirty-five articles, the main points of which are: State-owned enterprises should be managed in a business-like manner, striving to be profitable without loss, and at a minimum, should be self-sufficient. If there is a surplus at the end of the year, it should be turned over to the national treasury. If there is a loss, it should be reported to the competent authority for appropriation from the national treasury. Amendment of the organizational regulations of the State-Owned Enterprise Sales Supervision Committee. The main amendments are to Articles 3 to 5, which stipulate that the committee shall have one chairman and one vice-chairman, and eleven members, who shall be appointed by the National Economic Council. The vice-chairman may be a full-time position, and nine to eleven experts may be hired as consultants.

Regarding the implementation measures of the economic reform plan, the financial and economic parts are being drafted by Xu Kan. The remaining parts have been reviewed by Gu Yuxiu and others in seven meetings. On the 23rd, Chen Lifu convened a comprehensive review meeting, and it is expected to be submitted to the meeting next week.

He gave a detailed analysis of the reasons for the recent price increases. His opinions were largely the same as those put forward by Huang Yuanbin, Shi Kuiling, and others, that is, the price increases were caused by inflation, excessive floating capital, speculative manipulation, the issue of self-provided foreign exchange, the Supervisory Committee's foreign exchange report, and the lack of coordination among various departments. Liu also analyzed the reasons for the price increase of various commodities one by one. Finally, he put forward concrete opinions on price control measures, such as cracking down on hoarding, increasing production, controlling materials, and strengthening transportation. He also said that people from all walks of life in Shanghai, whether in charge or ordinary people, believe that control is necessary. The report was highly praised by all the council members. It is reported that the entire control will be based on the reports of Liu and others in the future.

### US Considering China Policy, Ross Urges Release of Wedemeyer Report

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Acting US Secretary of State Lovett said: Senior government officials are considering US policy toward China (including economic and military aid matters). When reporters asked whether the United States intends to grant loans and weapons to China, he said: He cannot answer this question, because this matter is being considered by senior officials above him. Therefore, he does not intend to make any statement until Marshall determines the policy.

[This Newspaper News] New York, 24th Broadcast: Former US Congresswoman Ross, when appointed chairman of the Sino-American Policy Association last night, expressed her opinion: The State Department should reconsider the point of not publishing the Wedemeyer visit to China report.

Revised the principles of cotton exchange, originally stipulating that yarn mills could apply for another exchange to various banks and bureaus for the purchase of domestic cotton, and could also transfer to loan payment when necessary, and flower shops could also apply for exchange, but must have yarn mill orders; however, the Shanghai Cotton Business Association recently petitioned in Nanjing, explaining that cotton merchants purchase cotton regardless of whether there are orders, and all supply factory needs, and there is no other outlet, so it is not necessary to have order restrictions, and requested modification. It was decided that if the flower shop cannot provide a definition, it should still provide proof of which factory it is purchasing cotton for, and which factory it is selling to, so that it can be deducted from the yarn factory's quota to avoid duplication.

[This Newspaper News] Political Committee member Lei Zhen said to the trustee in Shanghai yesterday: "Regarding the nomination of candidates for our party in the general election, I advocate using the central designation instead of free competition, otherwise it will cause a split within a political party. In European and American countries, political party candidates are also proposed in a planned and unified manner by each party, and party members unanimously support them during the election." The trustee then asked whether it was true that the Kuomintang would support some social elites to participate in the general election? Lei confirmed this statement and said that because our country's party politics is not developed, this method must be adopted. Hu Shi, Wang Yunwu, and others will all receive the full support of this party.

### Rumor that US Proposes New Plan for Convening Peace Conference on Japan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Acting US Secretary of State Lovitt said at a press conference on the 22nd that there was a good opportunity to convene a preliminary peace conference on Japan before the end of this year. He said: He does not know how good the opportunity is. He said: The basic differences between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States still need to be negotiated and resolved. China's compromise plan for the voting procedure has been sent to the US government and is still under study by the authorities, and a response will be given at an appropriate time. When asked whether the Soviet Union had directly or indirectly expressed its acceptance of China's plan, Lovitt replied: He knew nothing about it. Lovitt also announced that the US Minister to the Soviet Union (former Director of the State Department's Far East Division) Hamilton had been called back to the country to serve as Marshall's representative, because MacArthur's political adviser Acheson had died in a plane crash, so he will assist Marshall in handling the peace conference on Japan. He also said that negotiations on matters related to the convening of the preliminary peace conference on Japan are currently being directly negotiated between the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Permanent Bureau because the Soviet Ambassador to the United States is not in Washington.

[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] A Newsweek reporter received a confidential report last week that: The US government proposed a new plan last week for convening the peace conference on Japan, making concessions to China and the Soviet Union, which may break the deadlock. In the revised US compensation plan, China's compensation has been increased from 20% to 30%, and the Soviet Union's has been increased from 3% to 4%. At the same time, the new plan states. The United States will propose an allocation of 18% from its requested 28% to be distributed to other countries. However, whether the Soviet Union is willing to participate in the meeting in the form proposed by the United States will be the determining factor in whether it receives this compensation allocation.

### How to Save the World's Crisis?

A Reappraisal of Inferiority Complex and Pessimistic Atmosphere

Due to the U.S. and Soviet representatives' tit-for-tat accusations at the United Nations General Assembly, and General MacArthur's excessive leniency in governing Japan, a kind of panic and pessimism has recently arisen in Chinese forums. It seems as if a third world war is imminent, and China will be engulfed in this future great war. The two articles, "How to Save the Future World's Serious Crisis?" by Huang Yanpei, recently published in Ta Kung Pao, and the reprinted "A Pebble in MacArthur's Hand" by Wang Yunsheng, can be considered the most prominent examples. Both of them criticized MacArthur's support for Japan and predicted that in the future, Japanese militarists would land in Northeast China during the Third World War, fighting against the Soviet Union on one side and directly executing the task of "anti-communism" and even "剿共" (suppression of communists) against China on the other. This kind of argument is not only full of an inferiority complex and a pessimistic atmosphere, forgetting China's position on the international stage after the war, but also contains a strong poison, confusing the eyes of general readers, preventing them from seeing the development of the world situation in the future, and causing them to fall into the abyss of depression and pessimism.

If we really want to study where the crisis of the world situation lies in the future, and then seek a way to save it, we must first recognize the international situation after the war and even at present. The most important point is that among the many factors in predicting the evolution of the world situation, we must not forget everything about China itself. Because, in any case, after eight years of long and bloody war, China has its own independent right to speak on the world situation, at least on the Far Eastern situation.

Looking at the world after the war, it has been more than two years since Germany and Japan surrendered and the war ended. The new era of peace and democracy that people longed for during the war has not only not arrived in the world, but true peace seems even more distant from the world because of the way the Allies have also been slightly tainted with the colors of aggressor nations. Especially after the emergence of the new Communist International, the opposition between the two major camps in the world seems particularly obvious. This sad phenomenon is indeed bound to disappoint those who hoped for peace after the war. However, from a general point of view, it cannot be considered that today is the eve of the outbreak of the Third World War, let alone assert that the nature of the Third World War must be a struggle between the two major groups of the United States and the Soviet Union. I remember that at the end of the First World War, a social revolution took place in the Soviet Union, which not only made a separate peace with Germany, but also met the world with the Soviet regime; when the war ended, most countries in the world expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union, not only did they not establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, but they all regarded the Soviet Union as a flood and a beast. Therefore, at that time, general political commentators were worried about the world, and unanimously believed that the nature of the next war would be a war between socialist countries and capitalist countries. However, history is the best proof. Not only did this worry not come true, but in the Second World War, the Soviet Union initially signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany and remained neutral, and later changed and allied with the United States and Britain, fighting side by side, sharing life and death, and achieving victory after the war. Therefore, looking at the current world situation and thinking about the situation after the First World War, there is really no need to be too pessimistic and fearful about the current world; and to immediately make a dogmatic judgment that the third world war that is about to come must be a war between the United States and the Soviet Union is too simple and too serious.

If we look back at China today, we must not hold an inferiority complex and think that the situation on the international stage in the future will still be a heartbreaking situation of "I am the fish and meat, and people are the knife and cutting board." This eight-year war of resistance not only gave us valuable lessons, but also awakened the soul of the nation; although the current situation in China is not satisfactory, it is not comparable to China after 1919. Looking back on that year, the international situation in the Far East, except for the Soviet Union's efforts in material construction and no time to take care of other things, has changed little. Our enemy, Japan, was flying high after the war, and further increased its arrogance in invading China. Moreover, the warlords in our country occupied one side, brave in internal wars but timid in external struggles, did not know what the country was, and fundamentally could not talk about how to prepare to cope with the future great changes. Therefore, the Second World War broke out because of Japan's invasion of China. However, due to the National Government's completion of the Northern Expedition, unifying the country, enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, and resisting strongly, the Second World War finally ended due to Japan's surrender. As for today's China, although the whole country has not been able to seek progress from stability and embark on the road of national construction and rejuvenation because of the Communist bandits' rebellion and harming the country, the National Government has been determined to move towards the road of democracy on the one hand, and resolutely mobilized to suppress the rebellion and save the country on the other hand. Regardless of whether there is foreign aid or not, it will not be difficult to eliminate the Communist bandits and complete unification within a year and a half, in order to prepare for resisting foreign aggression. This bright prospect will surely encourage the people of the whole country to work together and move forward under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. There have been many peasant uprisings in Chinese history, but once they become bandits, they are doomed to failure. The reason why the Communist bandits are not enough to be a disaster for China is because the Communist bandits are in addition to the nature of bandits, plus the nature of "national traitors," which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese nation.

Secondly, the post-war international organization, first of all the United Nations organization, its task is to promote international understanding and cooperation, and then to maintain world peace, and its most effective organization is the Security Council, China is also one of the five permanent members, for the solution of any international problem, has the special privilege to exercise the veto power, and the status of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union is exactly the same. The most concerned issue in China after the war is the peace treaty with Japan; in the Far Eastern Commission dealing with the Japanese issue, China is also one of the four powers with veto power. Any opinion of China on the Japanese issue should be given special respect by other countries. Therefore, China can be said to be the only stabilizing force in the Far East, and it has a great role in maintaining world peace, which no one can deny. The reason why Britain and the United States want China to become a unified, strong and democratic country is to make China the largest stabilizing force in the Far East, thereby promoting world peace. Friendly countries still have great expectations for our country. How can we belittle ourselves and think that the United States and the Soviet Union can decide everything in the world?

After the war, China, in order to devote itself to national construction in peace, and to seek progress in stability, seeks international peace and domestic stability in everything. The parting ways of the United States and the Soviet Union is not what we want to hear; moreover, China treats the United States and the Soviet Union equally, and is more willing to see them eliminate their anger. The United States is our ally in times of trouble. During the war, it assisted our country in fighting against Japan. After the war, we still hope that the United States can assist our country in reviving and building the country and jointly maintaining peace in the Far East. Similarly, the Soviet Union is also our friend and has signed a treaty of alliance and friendship. As long as the Soviet Union can abide by the obligations of the treaty, all problems between China and the Soviet Union will not be difficult to obtain a reasonable solution. Situated between the United States and the Soviet Union, we not only do not want to see these two major allies blame each other, but also often want to regard ourselves as a bridge, thereby promoting cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Our representative often puts forward suggestions to reconcile the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union in any international conference, which is a strong proof. Regardless of whether our wish can be easily realized, as long as China strives to become strong, it will of course have this qualification.

From the above, it can be seen that China's position in the international community today is not what it used to be. As long as we do not be self-conscious and cowardly, and the whole country is united to eliminate the destructive forces that abandon themselves, then we can greatly realize our ambition to stabilize the Far East. Only if we ourselves strive for success and concentrate all our forces to quickly defeat the Communist bandits' attempt to create an international source of chaos in the Northeast will this spark not start a prairie fire. Therefore, if we want to save the future world crisis and prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression, the only way is for the Chinese government to control the main engine in the Northeast. The purpose of the war currently being carried out by the National Army in the Northeast is not only to eliminate the international source of chaos, but also to play a role in easing the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. There will definitely not be a fact that the Japanese army will land in our Northeast again. For the Japanese, if they harbor this ambition, it is just a wild fantasy; as for us Chinese who sing this tune, it will become an absurd heresy!

In terms of the policies adopted by the United States in governing Japan, there are bound to be places that are too lenient. According to common saying, if the United States' Far Eastern policy means that the United States intends to use Japan to oppose the Soviet Union, so it can allow the rise of Japanese aggressive warlords, then this view is either slanderous or delusional. The American government and the public will always remember the bloody lesson of the Pearl Harbor incident. Moreover, the American people unanimously believe that the focus of the Far Eastern problem after the war is on how to control Japan so that its aggressive forces cannot rise again. Among the Japanese people, there may be some flattery to the United States and anti-Soviet remarks, hoping to have a chance to turn over one day, but we must know that this is a strategy for Japan to provoke the feelings of the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States must also know this very well, and the lesson of the Anglo-Japanese alliance has made the American government and the public have a deeper understanding of Japan; even if Americans are forgetful, how can they let the Japanese "put on clothes like a monkey," and come to trample on our territory in the Northeast again!

In short, the reason why these pessimistic political commentators make this strange theory of alarmist is nothing more than to make the general readers unintentionally accept their so-called simple logic of "anti-communism is to be a slave of the United States," and to provide a shield for the Communist bandits to divide the territory of the Northeast. What they do not know is that if we want to prevent the aggression of Japanese forces, we can use our veto power in diplomacy; and domestically, we must have a strong military force to eliminate the Communist bandits. Only when China eliminates the Communist bandits and the Northeast does not fall into the hands of the Soviet Union can the Far East be stable and the world have peace.

### Opinions of Kuomintang Legislators and Supervisors on Nomination of Candidates

[Our newspaper Nanjing, 23rd dispatch] More than forty Kuomintang legislators of the Legislative Yuan held a discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd to discuss the issue of legislator nominations. Chairman Liu Guanxun pointed out that most legislators felt that there were many omissions in the candidates nominated by the provinces and cities. Only one-fifth of the incumbent legislators were nominated, which was unfair. They proposed: Although the total number of legislators is more than one hundred, even if all of them are elected, they will only account for one-seventh of the future total number. Incumbent legislators have been engaged in legislative work during the period of political tutelage and have a wealth of experience. Some legislators have been loyal to the party for more than their lifetime, and many have made great contributions to the revolution. If they cannot be nominated, it is unfair. It was decided that Liu Guanxun, Sun Jiulu, Tan Tiwu, and ten others should report this situation to President Sun and Vice President Wu, hoping that the central government would seriously handle the nomination matters and take the reports from the provinces and cities as the ultimate basis.

[Another dispatch] Kuomintang supervisors of the Supervisory Yuan held a discussion meeting on the morning of the 23rd, chaired by Cui Shushu. The main points of the discussion were as follows: Recently, many disputes have arisen in various provinces and cities due to the list of candidates. The central government should be requested to implement the spirit of impartiality and make a decision with full authority. Regarding the issue of participation in elections by friendly parties, the party should be requested to adhere to the spirit of harmonious consultation and reach an agreement as soon as possible, so as to avoid affecting the election affairs. Most of the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan have served the party and the country for a long time. Those who do not participate in the election this time, the government should also find ways to use them, saying that they will continue to serve the country, so as to avoid discontent. Finally, it was decided to appoint several supervisors to form a sub-committee to sort out and make textual revisions, submit them to the discussion meeting for discussion, and send them to the central government for adoption.

### Amon Stated at a Press Conference: Britain is Relying on Its Own Efforts for Recovery; Economic Recovery Does Not Entirely Depend on U.S. Loans

The following are important questions and answers from the press conference held by the British delegation to China yesterday morning:

What is the British public opinion on the Hong Kong issue? Sir Amon replied that it was not raised.

What is the outlook for Britain's recovery? Lord Amon replied that Britain's recovery will depend on its own hard work, not necessarily on U.S. loans. Member of Parliament Harrison said that the difficulty of Britain's economic recovery is not necessarily the lack of U.S. dollar positions, but the lack of customers for British goods; the slow recovery of other countries after the war has affected the progress of Britain's recovery, and China is one of these countries.

What are your suggestions for Sino-British economic cooperation? Member of Parliament Roberts replied that Britain needs soybeans, grains, eggs, and other items from China, and China also needs British production machinery. Currently, Britain has surplus products for export, while China does not. Therefore, if Britain wants to trade with China on a large scale, it must first provide credit loans to China, which is the difficulty. However, the prospects for Sino-British economic cooperation are very good.

What are your opinions on China's refusal to open inland waterway navigation? Lord Amon replied that China's refusal may indicate that China is not yet ready to discuss such issues with Britain. Britain's imports allow ships from all countries in the world to enter, and Britain will never ask other countries for what it cannot allow others itself. The opinion of Du Yuesheng, chairman of the China Shipping Association, is a valuable suggestion.

What are your views on the peace treaty with Japan? Sir Amon replied that Britain hopes that the peace treaty can be established as soon as possible so that the world can return to normal, but prudent measures must be taken at the same time to avoid leaving trouble for the future; this should be the case for both Japan and Germany.

What are your views on the establishment of the European Communist International? Member of Parliament McEntee replied: "We do not wish to comment on this matter, but the British people firmly believe that the democratic politics of socialism is the only way to achieve prosperity and lasting peace. Any country that does not give its people the freedom to establish a dictatorship is violating the greatest interests of people all over the world."

Britain's Social Reforms Have Achieved Significant Results

At this point, the head of the British Information Office suggested that the delegation describe the Labor Party's policies. McEntee also gave a concise account, saying that after the Labor Party came to power, it devoted itself to extensive social reforms, the main points of which are:

Family Allowance System - Currently, British families with four children of school age can receive a government allowance of fifteen shillings per week. This is a great help to families and a great burden to the government.

Social Insurance System - Provides protection for the sick, unemployed, and elderly, which is very important to the welfare of workers and has gained great support.

National Health Service - The main point is the nationalization of hospitals, so that British people can get the best medical services regardless of their economic circumstances.

Veterans' Allowance System.

Agricultural Minimum Wage Regulations, which will be implemented after the Agricultural Act is passed in Parliament. This move will completely change the status of farmers in Britain and make the increase in food production successful. In summary, today is the period of the greatest social reform in British history. In the agricultural sector, there is a possibility of cooperation between China and Britain, because Britain is famous for manufacturing small-scale agricultural machinery, and the degree of agricultural mechanization in Britain itself is very high, so its agricultural machinery and expertise can help China improve its agriculture in the future. The reception ended at 11 o'clock.

Shui Xiangyun's Welcoming Speech Blesses British Workers

Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech at the reception for the British delegation to China yesterday: "Among the members of your delegation are two Labor Party members who were born as workers, representing your country's workers to visit our country's workers, which shows your country's importance and concern for our country's workers. We are very fortunate to have this. The party in power in your country is the Labor Party. This visit to Shanghai will definitely provide guidance on the organization and activities of Shanghai workers.

Finally, on behalf of the Shanghai working class, I would like to pay tribute to your country and ask you to bring this respect to all the workers in your country. I wish you all success and good health!" Then, the head of the delegation, Lord Amon, delivered a brief speech of thanks. After the meal, a symposium was held. At the meeting, Lord Amon raised three questions: Does China have a national labor organization? How does the Chinese government handle labor disputes? Do Chinese workers have the right to strike? Chairman Shui immediately replied: The National Federation of Trade Unions is being organized, and trade unions such as postal and maritime workers already have national organizations. When labor disputes occur, the Chinese government arbitrates according to the Trade Union Law. Chinese law allows workers to have the right to strike, but currently the National Government has issued a general mobilization order prohibiting strikes and slowdowns, but this is a temporary phenomenon. The symposium ended at approximately 3 PM.

### U.S. Aid to Europe is Like an Arrow on the String; Marshall Says It Has Reached the Action Stage; Truman Urges Europe to Strive for Self-Help

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] President Truman convened Congressional leaders at 7:30 PM tonight (4:30 AM Shanghai time) in the White House to discuss aid to Europe.

[United Press, New York, 22nd] Marshall said at the New York Herald Tribune forum today that the U.S. action to revive Europe is like an arrow on the string. President Truman also sent a message to Mrs. Wright, the initiator of the two associations, saying that the decisions taken by the United States will drastically affect the relationship between the United States and the entire world. Truman's letter stated: We must be extremely cautious to ensure that the steps we take truly achieve the purposes we intend. We must face the fact that the United States cannot revive Europe alone. Our effectiveness lies only in assisting Europe's own self-help. We must especially grasp the fact that what we do does not harm our own economic life. There can be no stable world until the people of Europe fully contribute to the stability of the world, and the United States will have no complete peace and security.

Marshall's speech criticized the inappropriateness of mentioning the "Marshall Plan" everywhere and at all times. He said that in fact there was a "suggestion" but no "plan". We are currently drafting a plan as a suggestion to the U.S. Congress. The research and preparation phase is nearing completion, and the time to take action is at hand. He said that most of the State Department officials currently work seven days a week, cooperating with other government departments to prepare aid proposals. Therefore, when it is completed, it will truly become a plan of the U.S. government, not a plan of any department or organization.

### The Soviet Union Attempts to Control the Middle East; The U.S. is Considering Timely Aid

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] It is reported that the Harriman Committee is studying a "Little Marshall Plan" to aid the Middle East. They believe that the United States must prevent other parts of the world from lacking opportunities and resources when the Marshall Plan is implemented. The committee believes that the Middle East is another area of political conflict, and the Soviet Union is attempting to gain political power in the region. If the Middle East aid plan is implemented, Palestine will be the economic protagonist, as it is the only region with industry. Aid to other countries in the Middle East should focus on developing oil mines and improving agricultural and irrigation systems.

### Western European Representatives Express Deep Concern; The U.S. Reduces the Level of Aid; The Implementation of Aid to Europe is Being Discussed

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Diplomatic authorities here recently revealed that the negotiations between the representatives of the Paris Sixteen-Nation Conference and U.S. government officials have encountered three problems that may become a serious test of cooperation between Europe and the United States. The first is the aid provided by the Western Hemisphere other than the United States. The report of the Paris Conference stipulated that Canada and Latin America should provide materials worth 6 billion yuan within four years. Francois, chairman of the Paris Economic Cooperation Committee, and U.S. officials are studying the issue of who will pay this huge sum.

The second is the issue of organizing a continuing aid institution. Francois and his colleagues held discussions on this matter today. Three more problems have arisen: namely, what kind of say will the United States have in this European-based institution that will supervise the entire plan; what relationship should this institution have with the U.S. institution that will be established to manage the implementation of the Marshall Plan on the U.S. side; and what kind of cooperation should this institution have with existing European institutions such as the European Economic Cooperation Committee and the World Food Committee. The third is the amount of U.S. dollars that the United States can provide. European representatives and U.S. officials are drafting a formula so that the figures proposed by the Paris Conference will not be reduced to aid equivalent to relief.

### The Remaining Balance of the U.S. Loan to Britain Will Be Difficult to Thaw in the Short Term

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Treasury Secretary Snyder revealed today that he has informed British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton that he cannot take final action on unfreezing the remaining 400 million yuan of the British-American loan until he has consulted with Congressional leaders. This issue is still under study and is one of the topics to be discussed with British experts.

### Knudsen Advocates Reducing the Amount of Aid to Europe

[This newspaper report] New York, 24th broadcast; Washington report, Republican Congressman Knudsen, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said today that the federal economy cannot allow the implementation of the Marshall Plan on the one hand and the reduction of taxes by 4 billion yuan on the other. He believes that when Congress discusses the aid to Europe plan next year, the amount of aid to Europe will be limited to 1 billion yuan, and it will be impossible to exceed this amount.

### Italy Applies to the U.S. for a Loan of 170 Million U.S. Dollars

### France Sells Gold Worth 1.5 Billion U.S. Dollars

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] People from the French Embassy here revealed that France has sold gold worth as much as 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in the past three years, and the current gold reserves are only 455 million U.S. dollars, as well as a small number of equalization fund gold reserves. Since July 1 of this year, a total of 250 million yuan has been sold, most of which has been sold to the United States.

### Zhdanov Writes an Article Attacking the Marshall Plan

[United Press, Moscow, 22nd] Zhdanov, an important member of the Soviet Politburo, published a statement in Pravda today, which took up two full pages, calling on communist party members and sympathizers around the world to fight together against U.S. imperialism's occupation of the world. He also stated that the Soviet Union should come forward to lead the effort to smash the Marshall Plan and prevent the United States from turning Europe into its "forty-ninth state."

### The Conservative Party Proposes an Amendment to the King's Speech in the House of Commons

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Opposition leader Churchill and five other Conservative members of Parliament today proposed an amendment to King George VI's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, criticizing his failure to ensure national leadership to cope with Britain's economic crisis. The amendment is tantamount to an impeachment case against the government.

### To Cope with the Serious Political and Economic Situation, Ramadier Forms a New Cabinet; The de Gaulle Faction Attempts to Seize Power

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] After the French cabinet resigned en masse yesterday, Prime Minister Ramadier has formed a new cabinet with 13 cabinet seats, including 7 members of the Socialist Party, 3 members of the Popular Republican Movement, 2 members of the Radical Socialist Party, and 1 independent. Most of the cabinet members served in the previous cabinet, but several have changed positions. Ramadier told reporters that "in order to cope with the serious political situation, we feel that it is necessary to organize a concentrated cabinet to give it the power that is currently urgently needed."

Ramadier said that there are no members of the "French People's Alliance" led by de Gaulle, which won the election last Sunday, in the new cabinet, because "only parties that have representatives in parliament" can participate in the cabinet, and de Gaulle's party has no representatives in parliament. The new cabinet held its first cabinet meeting after midnight.

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Ramadier declared today that the French political climate is full of electricity and nervous tension has reached its peak. The labor movement has become a political movement, the purpose of which is to overthrow the regime and prevent production. This harm to the republican system comes from the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction and must be appealed to the National Assembly.

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Ramadier has formed a smaller cabinet and put economic affairs under the command of a national economic minister. The former economic minister Philippe, the agriculture minister Prereliang, and several cabinet members who echoed the de Gaulle faction will all be kicked out of the new cabinet.

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] De Gaulle's spokesman declared today that the leader of the French national liberation will use the victory in the municipal election to demand the re-election of the National Assembly in order to seize power. De Gaulle had already won the support of nearly half of the members of the National Assembly before the municipal election. If he can win the support of two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly, he can vote to automatically dissolve the National Assembly and hold a general election. If he only wins a majority, he can vote to dissolve the National Assembly and submit the issue of re-election to the people for a referendum.

### List of French New Cabinet

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] The list of the new French cabinet is as follows: Prime Minister Ramadier (Socialist Party) Foreign Minister Piche (Popular Republican Movement) Minister of National Defense de Gaulle (Popular Republican Movement)

Finance Minister Hsu Shou (Popular Republican Movement)

Chief of General Affairs Chuanchuan (Radical Socialist Party) Interior Minister Tap (Socialist Party) Minister of Justice Marie (Radical Socialist Party) Minister of Education Naiqilian (Socialist Party) Minister of Economy Moshu (Socialist Party) Minister of Social Affairs Mei Yi (Socialist Party) Minister of Industry Laigust (Socialist Party) Minister of Agriculture Lukklo (Independent) Minister of Colonial Affairs Juxiate (Socialist Party)

### Iranian Parliament Passes a Bill Rejecting the Iran-Soviet Oil Agreement; Suggests the Government Reopen Negotiations with the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Tehran, 22nd] The Iranian Parliament passed a bill tonight, equivalent to rejecting the 1946 Iran-Soviet oil agreement, suggesting reopening negotiations with the Soviet Union. The case was drafted by members of parliament at a secret meeting yesterday. Before the vote, Prime Minister Sudaner gave a speech, stating that he was the person who signed the agreement with the Soviet Union and hoped to abide by the agreement. He also reported on his dealings with the Soviet government, which still requested the Iranian parliament to approve the oil agreement.

Sudaner emphasized that maintaining friendship with the Soviet Union is in Iran's own interest. In this regard, he specifically mentioned that the Soviet Union ignored the British, American, and Soviet treaty and refused to withdraw its troops from Iran in March 1946. He also said that the Soviet Union at that time hinted that it wanted to exchange the transfer of oil rights for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, which later became a request for joint development of oil fields. At that time, he refused the Soviet Union's request, and later the Soviet Union's pressure became stronger, so he had to accept the proposal of forming a joint Soviet-Iranian oil company, but stated that it would only be effective after being approved by the parliament.

### Bevin Talks About Foreign Policy; Believes He Can Manage Well Between the Two Major Groups; Strongly Says He Will Never Repeat Chamberlain's Mistakes

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Foreign Minister Bevin addressed a gathering of Labor Party members in his constituency of Wandsworth in southwest London, expressing his belief that a socially democratic Britain can become a great independent country between the two major ideologies of free enterprise and communism, and declared that he will never allow Britain to be attached to any side, whether it be Washington or Moscow.

He emphasized that he is determined to maintain a highly efficient army, navy, and air force. As foreign minister, he will never be a part of repeating Chamberlain's mistakes in 1939. Bevin continued: "Those who accuse me of being a war profiteer, I will always throw this lie directly back at them. Britain's struggle for peace is unparalleled by any other country. The indiscriminate accusations after the war are by no means the way to peace." Referring to the four-power foreign ministers' meeting to be held in London in November, he said: "If this meeting fails, it will be a terrible responsibility, and I will do my best to make this meeting a success. We must unify the economy of Germany, but we will never allow Germany to maintain the ability to launch another war."

### Stalemate in Silk Weaving Dispute: Refusal to Work? Malicious Strike? Workers Push Representatives to Present Three Demands; Management Indicates Preparation to Petition the Central Government

[Our Newspaper's Report] The labor-management dispute in the city's silk weaving industry remains at an impasse. All silk weaving factories in the Pudong district remained shut down yesterday. Worker representatives Tao Yunshan, Lu Lunyan, and He Hengfu went to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee at 10:00 AM, presenting the labor side's three demands: 1. For factories that are shut down due to management's refusal to allow workers to work, workers' wages should be paid as usual. 2. All factories should immediately settle wages for each month since May according to the regulations of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee. If management delays in settling accounts, the losses suffered by workers should be compensated by management. 3. Clause 2 of the 14th Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's ruling on the silk weaving labor-management dispute, "If management is unable to bear the burden, both parties may independently establish alternative methods," merely provides an excuse for management, creating disputes. Please abolish it. Also, the time limit of "four months" should be changed to indefinite. At the same time, the Silk Weaving Guild denied that management refused workers to work, and claimed that the workers were maliciously striking. It also stated that the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's repeated changes to the arbitration methods were very unreasonable, and the guild has separately notified the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association that it will send representatives to petition the central government.

According to Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, the arbitration methods of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee cannot be changed. Closing factories under the General Mobilization Order is absolutely not allowed, and strikes are strictly prohibited. If management is indeed refusing workers to work, then management is in the wrong, and wages should be paid as usual. Director Wu also analyzed the reasons why silk weaving factories are willing to close, stating that the black market price of rayon is currently three times higher than the allocation price of the China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC). The profits from processing the allocated rayon are less than selling the rayon on the black market. The Social Affairs Bureau is now determined to eliminate the rayon black market. Since CTIC holds 100% of the rayon, there should be no black market phenomenon if the allocation is reasonable. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau has requested CTIC to send the allocation list to the bureau this week for re-examination, and to organize a rayon allocation committee to make a public, rational, and scientific allocation, which will not be difficult to eliminate the rayon black market.

### City Government Holds Economic Conference: Decides to Add Gasoline Group; Recommends Controlling Cotton Prices

[Our Newspaper's Report] The 13th Economic Inspection Conference was held in the City Government conference room at 11:00 AM yesterday. The resolutions are as follows: 1. Regarding the inspection of hoarding and illegal operations by non-industry merchants and unregistered yarn and cloth exceeding the deadline, the Yarn and Cloth Group should earnestly implement it. 2. A Gasoline Group should be added, to be handled by the Gasoline Allocation Committee in consultation with the Public Utilities Bureau.

Mayor Wu, at the conference, gave a report to the chairman regarding the strict crackdown on hoarding and speculation, and instructed all groups to strengthen monitoring efforts. Also, due to recent cotton prices being unreasonably raised due to competition among banks and public and private textile factories, yarn and cloth prices have also risen accordingly, greatly affecting people's livelihood. The meeting formulated principles, recommending that the Executive Yuan be able to use effective methods to stop it. According to City Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian, since the implementation of the emergency measures for limited-time registration and confiscation of overdue yarn and cloth, the investigation results are very good. The cotton stock is sufficient for four or five months, and the yarn and cloth stock is also quite sufficient, with about 60,000 bales of yarn and over 1 million bolts of cloth.

### Public Utilities Bureau Director Discusses Car Transfer Issues

[Our Newspaper's Report] Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, in a discussion with reporters yesterday regarding the city's car conservation and transfer issues, stated that the current method of suspending car transfers is temporary and not a freeze on cars. According to central regulations, private individuals qualified to use cars are only doctors. The city plans to add supplements when implementing it, relaxing the standard for private individuals qualified to use cars. After the method is drafted and submitted to the central government for decision, car transfers will be allowed to those approved to use cars. To prevent situations such as transfers under false pretenses, a review committee will be jointly organized by the Import Management Committee, the Municipal Council, and the City Government to conduct strict reviews. Transfers will only be approved after passing the review. Regarding the issue of cars that have already been imported or have obtained import permits, after consultation with Mayor Wu, it has been decided that car importers who have registered and obtained import permits can sell the cars to those approved by the government to use cars, or exchange new cars with used cars from those with existing licenses for sale. For private individuals bringing cars back from abroad, a date will also be set, notifying shipping companies that those shipped before the set date will be allowed to import. Those shipped after the set date will be subject to review before a decision is made. As for vehicles from other cities that have already obtained fuel permits, they will no longer be reissued upon expiration, unless they apply for a Shanghai license and formally register in Shanghai.

Director Zhao also stated that there are still 167 cases pending for license applications submitted before the suspension of private car registration on October 14. These unresolved cases will also be reviewed and decided by the review committee.

### Tiered Fuel Allocation: Striving for Fairness

[Also reported] City Government Secretary-General Shen stated yesterday that the tiered fuel allocation method is still under careful study because there are concerns about unfairness during implementation, and the detailed methods have not yet been determined. Oil companies do not have detailed statistics on fuel consumption for factories, so they are currently investigating the fuel consumption of each factory in order to ensure fairness in future allocations. This matter is being discussed by the Gasoline Allocation Committee and the Public Utilities Bureau.

### Automobile Association: Emergency Meeting

The Shanghai Automobile Commercial Guild held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures regarding the authorities' freezing of car transfers, suspension of new licenses, and restrictions on private cars. It was decided to submit a petition to the Municipal Council, requesting it to forward a request to the City Government: 1. Car transfers should be unfrozen. 2. The suspension of car sales should be postponed, and the suspension of license issuance should also be postponed. 3. Please carry out a general registration of new and old cars in each car dealership, and set a deadline for sale in order to recover funds. According to the person in charge of the association, after the ban on car sales and the suspension of new licenses, new and old cars of various companies will inevitably be stranded, and huge amounts of funds will be frozen. Member dealerships have been approved by the Import Management Committee to issue car import permits, and many vehicles ordered from abroad have not yet arrived in Shanghai. If they cannot be sold after import and licenses cannot be obtained, the losses will be huge, and foreign exchange will be wasted. In order to uphold national policy and implement conservation measures, we will always abide by government laws and regulations, but we hope that the government will consider the livelihood and interests of merchants and the people.

### Public Education Personnel Clothing Distribution: Quantity and Price Regulations

[Our Newspaper's Report] The City Government has received instructions from the Executive Yuan regarding the winter clothing distribution method for public education personnel in the city.

The distribution price is 1,700 yuan per chi for blue cloth and 1,300 yuan per chi for cotton uniform material, which is consistent for both Beijing and Shanghai. The City Government has notified CTIC to take note and handle accordingly.

### Inspection of Juvenile Police: Director Yu Expresses Satisfaction

They are now awaiting the completion of training before being assigned to various entertainment venues and restaurants to carry out advocacy and conservation work.

### Taiwan Sugar Exports to Japan: Still Undetermined

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in order to promote the Taiwan sugar export plan, negotiated with General MacArthur's headquarters to ship 25,000 tons of medium-grain white sugar to Japan, offering a price of US$275 per ton, with all transactions in cash. It is now heard that General MacArthur's headquarters hopes to calculate according to the New York market price of US$0.05 per pound, which only amounts to just over US$100 per ton. Therefore, the negotiations have not been close for a while. The company is currently awaiting a telegram. Once a settlement is reached, the company will implement the plan for the second batch of Taiwan sugar exports to Japan.

### Danger of Nationally Refined Kerosene: Due to Adulteration by Retailers; Manufacturers State Reasons to the Social Affairs Bureau

[Our Newspaper's Report] Previously, the Price Evaluation Council decided to ban all factories from refining kerosene from diesel oil. Yesterday, representatives of the Nationally Refined Kerosene factory went to the Social Affairs Bureau to explain the composition of Nationally Refined Kerosene to the Price Management Section. They stated that the density of diesel oil is 36 degrees, imported kerosene is 45 degrees, gasoline is 60 degrees, and Nationally Refined Kerosene, which is refined from diesel oil, has a density lower than imported kerosene, around 40 degrees, and the burning degree is also lower than imported kerosene. However, retailers often mix half imported kerosene and half gasoline with Nationally Refined Kerosene, passing it off as imported kerosene for sale. This mixed oil has a very high density and a high flash point, so it is also very dangerous. However, the adulteration is done by retailers, and the Nationally Refined Kerosene factory cannot be responsible. Therefore, in order to prevent the sale of this dangerous type of oil, the Social Affairs Bureau should crack down on retailers who adulterate. Banning the oil refineries now is tantamount to "throwing out the baby with the bathwater," which will only increase the number of unemployed workers and destroy the foundation of our country's oil refining industry. The Social Affairs Bureau's Price Management Section believes that the oil refinery's explanation is not without reason, and will submit a report to the director to consider the proposal to lift the ban.

### Mayor to Leave Shanghai Today or Tomorrow: To Recuperate in Beiping

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu previously felt extremely tired due to handling municipal affairs and urgently needed rest. After submitting a request to the central government for a two-week leave, it was delayed due to various reasons. Now that the chairman has left Shanghai and returned to Beijing, and many other matters have been concluded, he has decided to leave Shanghai today or tomorrow with his wife to recuperate elsewhere. It is learned that his destination is Beiping. During his leave, municipal affairs will be handled by Secretary-General Shen.

### United Power Plant Contract: Arbitration Does Not Harm Sovereignty; Reduced Costs and Many Advantages; Direct and Indirect Benefits

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Council previously opposed Clause 13 of the United Power Plant contract, which stipulated that if there are disputes, an arbitrator should be designated by the president of the International Court of Justice for arbitration, believing that it would harm sovereignty. Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue told reporters yesterday that he had visited Dr. Wang Chonghui for this matter to request him to study the contract's contents. Dr. Wang believed that the International Court of Justice is composed of representatives from the judicial circles of various countries, and arbitration is a progressive method in judicial trials and does not involve any loss of sovereignty.

Director Zhao further stated that the purpose of the United Power Plant is to reduce the cost of electricity in Shanghai, and it has many advantages. For example, the six power plants originally intended to purchase a 10,000 kW generator each. Due to the establishment of the United Plant, only one 60,000 kW generator needs to be purchased, which is much cheaper in terms of unit price. The six generators originally required six groups of personnel to manage, but now only one group with higher technical skills is needed. In addition, each plant originally needed to set up a standby generator, totaling six, but now only one is needed. The United Power Plant plans to divide into four departments: power generation, transmission, distribution, and electricity consumption. The United Power Plant will generate and transmit electricity to each company, and then each company will distribute it to users. The establishment of the United Power Plant requires money, talent, and materials. Purchasing a 100,000 kW generator requires US$12 million, and the maintenance costs and all expenses after shipping to China also require US$10 million, so the total funds required are approximately US$20 million. However, after Chinese and foreign cooperation, the capital invested by foreigners can be used to directly purchase generators abroad and ship them to China, while the capital from the Chinese side will be used for maintenance costs and expenses. The United Power Plant is preparing to complete its preparations within five years, generating 100,000 kW per day (the current six companies can already generate around 170,000 kW), and then increasing it to 500,000 kW as needed. If it can be successful in the future, it can increase the equivalent of US$20 million in wealth each month in terms of production and indirect benefits. The required burden is only several hundred thousand US dollars per year, so it is also very cost-effective from an economic standpoint.

### Paper Inspection Group's First Resolution: Magazines and Books Should Use Domestic Paper as Much as Possible; Page Numbers for Weekly, Bi-Weekly, and Monthly Magazines Are Prescribed; Correct the Habit of Returning Newspapers to Avoid Wasting Paper

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Conservation Movement Committee's Paper Conservation Inspection Group held its first meeting at the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM yesterday.

Chairman Zhu Xubai reported on the establishment of the Paper Conservation Inspection Group. According to the resolution of the expanded meeting of the Conservation Movement Committee on October 14, the conservation of magazine paper will be implemented from November 1. The implementation period is approaching, and we should seek high-level insights on how to implement it. Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan, Li Bojia, Li Zikuan, Yuan Wenzhang, Chen Su, and others successively expressed their opinions, describing in detail the practical paper conservation methods for newspapers, news agencies, magazines, and books.

Printing Address Should Be Clearly Stated on Printed Materials

The discussion of each case then began, and the following resolutions were made: 1. Please instruct the Shanghai Pie Newspaper Guild to inform the newspaper delivery industry through the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau that the daily newspapers and evening newspapers (including large and small newspapers) that are recognized for sales are limited to the actual sales volume, and to correct the habit of returning newspapers to avoid wasting paper. 2. In order to facilitate the inspection of paper conservation, the name and address of the printing house that prints books and magazines should be stated on the last page of the book or magazine. 3. If a newspaper or magazine is suspended, the publisher should report it to the local government in accordance with the Publishing Law. If the number of days of suspension exceeds the prescribed period, the News Office and the Social Affairs Bureau will investigate and cancel its registration in accordance with the law. During the period of vigorously conserving paper, news agencies are allowed to continue registering, but they should use domestic paper as much as possible.

### Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Representatives from Four Unions: Re-discussing the Issue of Compiling the Index

Convening the persons in charge of the four major public utility unions in the city: electricity, tap water, gas, and British streetcars, to discuss the issue of compiling the cost of living index. The four unions have pointed out that the rice price in the worker index is based on broken rice, not Wuhu rice prices. Water and electricity costs are included in the housing rent and the percentage is unreasonable. They request to change the compilation method, and that the prices of daily necessities such as rice, oil, and fuel should use market prices, and water and electricity should be separated from housing rent and become an independent unit, etc. Director Wu explained that housing rent cannot be separated from water and electricity, and there is no fixed regulation on which rice price should be used in the cost of living index. Director Wu also expressed that it is difficult to realize the point that the four unions requested the use of market prices for rice in the index. Since the government has a ration of two dou of subsidized rice, the price of these two dou should be included in the calculation, and the remaining amount can use market prices.

### Lawyer for Kele Files a Petition Requesting On-Site Demonstration; Large Physique Makes Turning Around to Sniping Impossible

[Our Report] Kele, the British suspect in the murder of Yu Shengxiao, has been interrogated by the court several times. It is now learned that Kele's defense lawyer, Tang Huaiqun, submitted a petition to the court yesterday, stating that Kele is a large man. When driving, he sits in the driver's seat, and his body is already constrained by the steering wheel. Even if he wanted to turn around, it would be impossible due to natural limitations. How could he have turned around to shoot Yu Shengxiao? To obtain conclusive proof, the court is requested to subpoena Peter, a Russian, to drive the 1937 Chevrolet sedan to the court during the next hearing and have Kele perform on the spot to demonstrate whether he could turn around and fire a gun. Judge Zhu Yuhuang of the court, after receiving the petition, believes that Kele and Malae have already performed multiple times during police interrogation. The need for another test will be determined after consideration. The date of Kele's retrial will be decided after the American military court sends the judgment of Malae for reference, which is expected to be in early next month.

### Jiangshun Arrives in Shanghai; Ship Arrives, But Woman Does Not; Sister and Brother of Woman Who Jumped Overboard Grieve as They Claim Surviving Children

[Our Report] The news that a female passenger on the Jiangshun, Wen Yueying, committed suicide by jumping into the river near Wuhu has already been reported. The Jiangshun arrived in port at around 8:00 a.m. yesterday and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. Reporters interviewed the captain of the ship, Liu Hongce, and the business director, Zheng Shouye. They reported that the ship sailed from Hankou on the 19th of this month. At around 2:00 p.m. on the 21st, when passing the Qilishan Xizui lighthouse upstream of Wuhu, a female passenger jumped into the river. Another passenger saw it and reported it to the captain, who ordered the ship to turn around and rescue her. After more than ten minutes of searching, nothing was found, so the ship continued downstream. After investigation, it was learned that the female passenger was Wen Yueying, a 23-year-old from Meixian, Guangdong, who was in second-class cabin B, number 3. She previously worked at the Fourth District Engineering Office of the Telecommunications Bureau in Hankou. Her husband, Huang Min, is currently employed at the Central Electrical Equipment Factory of the Resources Committee in Hankou, residing at No. 19 Han'anli, Hankou. Her elder brother, Wen Qihua, lives at Lane 1958, No. 24 Linsen Road in this city, along with her mother and elder sister, Suiying. Wen Yueying has three daughters, the eldest is six years old, named Reng Huang, the second is four years old, and the youngest is three years old. After Yueying jumped into the river, the three daughters and luggage were kept on the ship and taken care of by the captain and business director, but there was no suicide note. After the captain telegraphed Shanghai, the China Merchants Bureau sent someone to report to her brother on the 22nd. Therefore, when the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, her brother and sister were already waiting at the wharf and took the luggage and children away. Her brother, Wen Qihua, is employed at the Jianli Company at No. 7, Section A, Zhongshan East Road. Reporters interviewed him, and he said that the reason for his sister's suicide was unknown, but he received a letter from his brother-in-law, Huang Min, on the 18th of this month, saying that Yueying was mentally disturbed and physically weak and planned to come to Shanghai for recuperation. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 22nd, someone from the China Merchants Bureau came to his house to report that she had committed suicide by jumping into the river near Wuhu. He has already telegraphed Hankou and asked Huang Min to come to Shanghai. However, according to another source, Wen's jumping into the river was due to family problems.

### Defending His Search for Grain for the Enemy, Claiming It Was to Help the People; Two Witnesses Fail to Confirm; Gao Jimin's Hearing Postponed

[Our Report] Gao Jimin, the former president of the puppet General Power Company, was originally sentenced to ten years in prison by the High Court, but the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial. The High Court held a hearing yesterday to investigate. Gao was accused of colluding with Xia Zhongming, Lan Baosun, Japanese nationals Horita, Matsuzawa, and others during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai to rent the General Power Company. Gao initially served as vice president and later became president. The company was affiliated with the enemy's Dengbu Force and was a special agent organization under the command of the enemy's military police. It purchased rice and supplies for the enemy's Zaibatsu Mitsui and Mitsubishi, which were used by the enemy's army. Later, branches were established in Nanjing, Wuxi, Wuhu, Bengbu, and other places, encompassing all materials in Central China. However, Gao defended himself yesterday, claiming that the company had delivered 46,000 tons of rice to the Rice Control Association for distribution to Shanghai citizens, which was an act beneficial to the people. The court then summoned Chen Guoquan, the director of the puppet Rice Control Association, and Zhou Chunyu, the secretary-general of the puppet Rice Control Association, as witnesses. According to the witnesses, the rice was negotiated for distribution with the Japanese side, and they were not very clear about the organization and tasks of the General Power Company at the time. The court stated that further investigation was needed and ordered a retrial at a later date. Gao remains in custody.

### The Harassment of the "Southern Route"

(Our Guangzhou dispatch of the 20th) I recently interviewed Ren, the county magistrate of Huaxian, who came to Guangzhou. His talk revealed to us some of the truth about the activities of the communists in the southern part of Guangdong Province.

The area of southern Guangdong Province (known as the "Southern Route" by the Cantonese), includes Zhanjiang City, Huaxian, Wuchuan, Maoming, Xinyi, Lianjiang, and the Leizhou Peninsula. These counties are bordered with Guangxi Province, and have water and land routes to Luchuan and Beiliu in Guangxi. At present, the area where the communist bandits are active is these counties. Zhanjiang City is their biggest target, but because of stronger security forces there, Huaxian has become the county bearing the brunt, because if Huaxian is controlled, Lianjiang, Maoxin, Xinyi and other counties will be threatened at the same time.

Old Troops of Zhang Yan

The communist bandits there can be mainly divided into two groups, which they recognize as the "regular army" or the "People's Liberation Army". One group is led by Zheng Kunlian, Zhang Yan's wife, and Zhuang Tian. The members of this group are mostly political work team student soldiers and others of Zhang Yan's old troops, as well as some primary school teachers and high school students, so they are considered their excellent "cadres." However, their number is not large, and the main force of combat still relies on the troops of the bandit leader Fu Chunmao. Fu was the regiment leader of a puppet army during the war. After the victory, he took this group of people to the bandit army. They are completely remnants of traitors, numbering about two thousand.

Li Ying's Bandit Troops

Another group is Li Ying's troop of about 1,200 men, the so-called "Fourth Regiment of the People's Liberation Army." These so-called "regular army" all have military uniforms, numbers, and are equipped with rifles, light and heavy machine guns, grenades, small cannons, horses, etc. Most of these things were left over by the enemy and puppet troops, and a small part was robbed from the people. In addition, there are some scattered bandits that do not belong to their "regulars", mostly in groups of one or two hundred people. The source of the members is local thugs, unemployed vagrants, and some farmers who have no land to cultivate and are forced to make a living. They are actually bandits and have no political nature.

Wandering Ways

These two bandit troops often wander around the counties of southern Guangdong. Sometimes they are near Zhanjiang, and sometimes they suddenly go to Maoming. When they see places with many government troops, they avoid them. When they know places with insufficient security, they come to harass for a while. So sometimes several hundred bandit troops are found here, and more than a thousand bandit troops are found there. It is thought that they are everywhere, but in fact, it is just their coming and going harassment.

No Fixed Footing

They have no fixed footing, and naturally there is no so-called base. They boast that they are mobile, without worries. Moreover, they are good at night attacks and can endure hardship. However, they lack ammunition, guns, and food supplies. Moreover, most of the bandits have not been trained and lack military knowledge and combat experience. Their combat power is very weak, and their will to fight is also very low. The purpose of their wandering around is to rob the people's self-defense guns with greater force, destroy the grassroots organizations of the government, and try their best to buy over thugs everywhere to establish puppet organizations, send out so-called commissioners, county magistrates, township chiefs, village directors, etc., and organize puppet women's associations, farmers' associations, and establish so-called "underground grassroots organizations." In the places under their control, they use the most brutal means to extort money, forcibly collect grain, and forcibly conscript men.

Rumor Offensive

The bandits' propaganda is quite exaggerated. They use a rumor offensive, saying today that they will attack a certain county seat, and tomorrow they will say that they will attack a certain large town, but the city defenses of the counties in the Southern Route are all built very firmly. Ordinary cities are built with large bunkers, and the bandits cannot easily cross the Lei Pool. For example, the county seat of Hua County, they have also threatened to attack the city more than 40 times, but never once have they been able to approach within 30 li. At present, the military force guarding the area, in addition to the three corps of the security police, relies entirely on local teams and people's self-defense organizations to be responsible. Therefore, they can only do defense work and have not been able to disperse the main force of the bandits.

Strengthening Military Force

According to the observation of Ren, the county magistrate of Hua County, he said that if we can increase some troops and cooperate with local teams, it is not difficult to completely eliminate the communist bandits in the Southern Route. However, he also pointed out that the increasing banditry in the Southern Route is greatly related to the failure to solve the two major problems of land and people's livelihood. Because of social unrest and surplus labor, the communist bandits are given many opportunities, so he believes that the fundamental solution is to solve these two problems.

Suppression and Appeasement Together

Recently, since Chairman Song went to Guangdong, he has decided to first solve the problem of public security, established the Southern Guangdong Bandit Suppression General Command, and appointed Chen Pei, director of the Security Police Department, as the commander-in-chief. At the same time, more than five regiments of troops have been dispatched to the Southern Route to implement suppression and appeasement together. On the one hand, they are tolerant of communist bandits who come to surrender and reform, and on the other hand, they implement suppression with the pressure of thunder. It is believed that the mystery of the strength of the communist bandits in the Southern Route will be revealed in the near future. (Special correspondent Liang Feng)

### October Wind of Price Hikes Sweeps

(Our Guangzhou dispatch of the 20th) On the eve of the October wind of price hikes, Hong Kong dollars took the lead, soaring 700 at once, and gold responded by rising from 280 to 320. "One success leads to the rise of all," and the prices of all goods are rushing forward in a flood-like state. Hong Kong dollars were 800 today, and are expected to advance to 900 early tomorrow, and then 1100, 1200, 1300. At the time of this reporter's writing, a lot of "Western paper" that "can be seen and held in the hand" is still hovering between 137 and 140. Gold is still trading in the black market at 470. The military has launched large-scale operations, forcibly stopping black market trading of gold and banknotes, closing illicit exchange houses, and arresting "speculators" (Cantonese call black market dealers in gold and banknotes "banknote friends"). The situation has stabilized for a few days, but everything has returned to a state of frenzy. As a result, large amounts of funds are flowing south to arbitrage Hong Kong dollars. Recently, the banks and exchange houses here seem to have nothing on their minds except for the two big words "telegraphic transfer." Telegraphic transfer business accounts for more than 80%. The amount of money remitted to Guangzhou from Shanghai, Hankou, and other places reaches 50 billion yuan per day, which is simply an endless flood, with Hong Kong as the final destination. If the Hong Kong exchange rate fluctuates by one foot, the Guangzhou market will never fluctuate by just nine inches. "Digging tail dragons" (speculators) are adding fuel to the fire, coordinating with the momentum coming from Shanghai. There are no less than 300,000 people in Guangzhou who live on salaries. How will they survive this difficult winter? (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)

### Wuhu Grain Merchants Purchasing Grain on Behalf of the Grain Department; Breach of Contract and Failure to Pay Case Tends to Ease; Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Li Jiazhong, Released on Bail

(Our Wuhu, 23rd dispatch) The case of Wuhu grain merchants purchasing grain on behalf of the Grain Department, breaching their contract, delaying payments, and defaulting, has tended to ease. In addition to the 20,000 bags already purchased, the 24 grain merchants plan to purchase another 10,000 bags. For the remaining 20,000 bags, they have requested the Grain Department to pay the market price at the time of purchase. One of the three inspectors of the Grain Department returned to Nanjing this morning to request instructions. According to the grain merchants, the purchase of 20,000 bags on behalf of the Grain Department has already resulted in a loss of 3.12 billion yuan. The purchase of the additional 10,000 bags will require a further loss of 1.98 billion yuan. This 5.1 billion yuan loss will be compensated by collecting an extra 30,000 yuan per bag on the 170,000 bags of export rice shipped from the 24 grain stores to Qingdao and Tianjin. Yan Qingrong, a member of the Wuhu County Council, and others have criticized this matter, accusing Li Jiazhong, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and others of wasting the grain merchants' surcharges in Nanjing, arbitrarily entering into a grain purchase agreement with the Grain Department together with five grain stores, and failing to fulfill the agreement, which has seriously affected the credibility of Wuhu merchants. Li Jiazhong has now been released on bail.

(Our Wuhu, 23rd dispatch) The Grain Department will soon expedite the allocation of 960,000 bags of military and public grain in Wuhu, each bag weighing 190 catties, and will send a Vice Minister to Wuhu to supervise the process. Also, it is reported that the Central Farmers Bank has already started purchasing grain in Wuhu. People from southern and central Anhui in Wuhu will appeal to the central government to allocate funds for the purchase of grain, so as not to affect the people's food supply in Anhui Province. The two should not be confused.

### Low-Cost Dining at Datong University; Students Pay Only 150,000 per Month

[Our dispatch] The student dining at Datong University this term is still managed by representatives elected by the students themselves, with elections held every half month. All those elected to run the dining hall are able to fulfill their responsibilities and work hard for the benefit of the public. As a result, students pay only 150,000 yuan per month for dining, and the dishes and rice for each meal are enough to fill their stomachs. Three meals a day, in addition to porridge and ten side dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner are all four-course meals and rich in nutrition. Because there are now more than 1,700 students eating in the school this term, the original dining utensils are insufficient, and the dining hall is also unable to accommodate all of them, so the dining time is divided into two shifts for each meal.

The dining fee for students at Datong University is said to be the lowest among all universities and colleges in Shanghai, because: 1. Rice is allocated by the government; 2. The school authorities subsidize student meals; 3. Due to the effective dining management methods.

The school authorities said that in the midst of rigorous frugality, Datong's dining fee can be so low, which can be said to be a practical achievement of frugality.

During the Games, many unpleasant incidents occurred, mostly due to unfair judging of athletes from various counties and districts outside of Lanzhou, and the overly enthusiastic cheering squad from Lanzhou City. This caused the other competitors, who already lacked confidence in defeating Lanzhou, to become even more panicked and perform poorly. After several rounds of protests, things were settled through mediation. In the last two days, cheering squads were forbidden from making noise, and the Games were considered to have concluded "successfully."

Sports Queen

The one who stole the spotlight this time was not Wang Sixin (from Lanzhou City), who almost broke the national record in the 10,000-meter race, nor the female team members who almost broke the national record in the 200-meter preliminary relay (with a time of 29 seconds), but the election and coronation of the "Sports Queen." The election was initiated by the Lanzhou branch of the Heping Daily on the fifth day of the Games (14th) and announced by noon the next day. It was clear that business interests outweighed public interest because the ballots were printed on the back of the newspaper, and anyone who wanted to vote had to buy a copy of that day's paper. As a result, Wang Peiying, a talented student from Lintao Women's Normal School in the Ninth District, was elected the "Sports Queen" of this session with 4,512 votes. Li Xichun, also from Lintao Women's Normal School in the Ninth District, was elected "First Runner-up" with 2,863 votes. The Games organizers did not comment on this activity. Only after the closing ceremony did photographers find this short, dark-skinned "Queen" in the crowd. At that point, the authorities from the Heping Daily rushed over with a crown made of red and green paper and placed it on her head, and many cameras were pointed at her. The next morning, the Heping Daily even held a tea party to celebrate them, and the president, Yi Junzuo, wrote a poem for the "Sports Queen" and presented it to her in an elaborate frame. Some criticized this as being a "Shanghai style" affair. In reality, Miss Wang herself was only eighteen years old, a true country girl who, although in her second year of high school, did not have the air of a "social butterfly." She was simply being used as an advertisement by others.

10,000-Meter Dispute

Regarding the 10,000-meter final, in addition to Wang Sixin, who rightfully won first place, there was another first-place winner, Luo Yingzhan from the Second District. This was the result of a dispute: In the early laps of the 10,000-meter final, Luo appeared particularly strong and had a good chance of winning. The second most likely winner was Wang Sixin. Among the twenty participants, about one-third were from Lanzhou City. Several Lanzhou athletes who were far behind surrounded Luo in order to secure the championship for the city, but Luo was unsuccessful in breaking free several times. In the final dash, Wang Sixin won the championship with a time of 36 minutes, 57.4 seconds. Luo finished second, not far behind. However, when it came time to award the prizes, the Second District argued that their athlete, Luo Yingzhan, had been forced into second place due to the encirclement, and the judges did not intervene, which seemed biased. They refused to accept the award. In the end, after much mediation, two first-place winners were declared. It remains to be seen who will represent Gansu in the National Games next year.

### Authorities Consider Improving Rationing System, Adjusting Supplies, and Stabilizing Prices; Rationing of Cooking Oil by Headcount Soon to be Implemented

[Report from This Newspaper] It is reported that the relevant authorities in this city are currently considering ways to improve the rationing system for various supplies. It is said that, in principle, resources will be prioritized for those supplies that have a greater impact and whose supply is not yet on the right track, and then a household rationing system will be adopted as much as possible. For supplies that are more normally supplied, rationing will first be implemented for the citizens most affected, and the rationing amount will be increased or decreased based on the actual situation.

Currently, only sugar is rationed by household. After research by the relevant authorities, it is believed that cooking oil also has value in being rationed by headcount, similar to sugar. The rationing method is currently being actively formulated. It is said that the principle will be to ration one catty of cooking oil per person per month. With a city population of four million, 40,000 dan of oil would be needed each month. The cooking oil will mainly be rapeseed oil. The price will generally follow the negotiated price for cooking oil. This plan is expected to be implemented in November.

The market prices of rice and flour have fluctuated recently, but the sources are abundant, especially for flour, of which this city has a surplus to be used to exchange for other necessary supplies in other areas. In addition to the direct rationing of rice to public educators (approximately 160,000 people), industrial workers (approximately 270,000 people), and several hundred thousand poor households specifically handled, another 150,000 professional workers are now being added, and the quota for poor households has been expanded to 980,000. It can be said that the citizens of this city who are most threatened by high rice prices have been rationed as much as possible. Other citizens can freely obtain rice from the market because the rice supply is abundant.

### Cotton Merchants Request Cancellation of Requirement to Present Orders for Export Financing; President Zhang Agrees to Consider Reasons

Regarding the issue of cotton merchants requesting the cancellation of the requirement to present orders from yarn factories in order to obtain export financing, President Zhang of the National Bank specifically met with Liu Pingsun and Zheng Zhezheng, representatives of the Cotton Merchants Association of this city, yesterday morning (the 23rd). The representatives presented the reasons for requesting the cancellation of the requirement to present orders from yarn factories in order to obtain export financing, and stated that requiring cotton merchants to provide orders to obtain export financing is equivalent to preventing cotton merchants from obtaining export financing, while other essential consumer goods do not have this restriction.

The cotton inventory in Shanghai is only slightly over 58,000 dan, which is only enough for yarn factories to use for five days. Before the war, Shanghai's cotton inventory always reached over one million dan. Now, as domestic cotton is coming to market, the government should supervise cotton merchants to actively purchase cotton and should not add restrictions that hinder supply, creating shortages and price spikes. Requiring cotton merchants to present orders from yarn factories to obtain export financing is indeed difficult, as mentioned above, and the theory that it is to prevent hoarding is also questionable. Hoarding is not a crime; hoarding and holding goods for speculation should be prohibited. In the current situation where cotton cannot be self-sufficient, it is necessary to facilitate the flow of cotton and increase inventory in order to meet supply and demand and stabilize cotton prices. As for the so-called cotton merchants not only considering their own private interests and seeking low-interest loans, thereby increasing the burden on others, in reality, cotton merchants only hope to finance their operations and do not seek low interest. If the cotton supply is blocked due to a lack of financing and cotton prices rise, it will inevitably increase the burden on many people.

President Zhang took the above points seriously and asked where the incoming cotton was stored and whether it could be concentrated in bank warehouses in order to facilitate control and achieve cooperation between merchants and the government. The representatives expressed their willingness to accept this, stating that cotton for which export financing is obtained can be required to be stored in bank warehouses, but they hope that the government will provide more financing convenience in order to expand business and increase the cotton supply. It is said that President Zhang agreed to consider this and resolve the issue in the short term.

### Rice Prices Slightly Increase, Oil Market Turns Bullish

Yesterday, a total of over 13,900 shi of rice arrived in the North and South Markets. The market initially rose and then weakened, and sales were very sluggish. As a result, japonica and indica rice rose by 10,000 yuan, and white rice also increased by 10,000 yuan, but the trend seemed unable to sustain the increase. The supply of wheat flour from Wuxi was very strong, and many were sold, continuing downstream, falling by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The supply and demand for wheat bran were both scarce, and there were no significant changes. Bean cake was slightly purchased by out-of-town buyers, rebounding by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were firm initially and then leveled off, broad beans fell steadily, red sorghum was sluggish, corn lacked buyers, sesame seeds were purchased in Tianjin, oil factories absorbed them at low prices, and local merchants opportunistically purchased them, recovering from weakness and rebounding by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, with medium-grade sesame seeds also increasing by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The decline in raw kernels was very intense, and with out-of-town buyers suspending operations, local merchants arbitrarily and aggressively sold off, falling by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.

The oil market turned bullish. Crude oil rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, soybean oil increased by 100,000 yuan, and sesame and rapeseed oil increased by over 100,000 yuan. The market fluctuated rapidly and unpredictably. However, the market weakened significantly at lunchtime, forming a pattern of rising in the morning and weakening in the afternoon.

### Export Goods Certification to be Implemented Next Month

The Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission has formulated export price review and certification, as well as import methods for packaging materials required for export goods, which have been approved by the Export Control Commission. The office has set a date to implement them next month and is rushing to prepare various application forms. If time permits, it can be implemented as early as the first day of next month. It is reported that the prices of various export goods must be reviewed and certified by the office before they can be exported. Exporters should apply to the office for price review when exporting goods and must attach the transaction contract and the exchange rate of the designated bank. According to the person in charge of the office, the implementation of this method will provide convenience to merchants, so that export goods will not be delayed in export.

### All Short Positions Have Been Liquidated; Stock Market Trend Turns Stable

Yesterday, as the stock market reached the date for the closing of forward contracts, most of the long positions were settled in advance, resulting in a continued weak market in the middle of the day. When all short positions had been liquidated, the market gradually stabilized with the help of looser credit. Buyers returned to the market, and the market became more firm, but the process was still volatile, with prices easily falling after rising. The market was slightly stable in the morning, and Yong Yarn opened higher at 285 yuan and 295 yuan. However, it was still difficult to deliver goods in the open market, and interest rates were still 2 jiao 7 and 3 jiao 1 fen. After 10 o'clock, the interest rates fell to a low of 276 yuan for immediate delivery and 287 yuan for forward delivery. The remaining short positions were cleared, and credit generally loosened. The closing prices at noon rose to 286 yuan and 295 yuan. Cold stocks such as Commercial Press Cement remained at low prices. Rongfeng Jinglun Matches did not rise, and the remaining stocks saw some stability. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices for immediate delivery, Lian'an and Zhongxing were flat, Commercial Press Cement fell by 10%, and Matches Jinglun and Rongfeng fell by 5%. Yong Yarn, Xinnuo, China Textile, Qinxing, and Huaxin rose slightly, and the rest saw small declines. For forward delivery, Meiya Huafeng and Jingfu fell by 5% each, and Yong Yarn, Xinnuo, and Qinxing fell slightly. Buyers were strong in the after-market, and Yong Yarn jumped to 294 yuan and 304 yuan. The highest prices reached 298 yuan for immediate delivery and 308 yuan for forward delivery. Open market bids suddenly fell, returning to 303 yuan at the close. Huaxin, Xinnuo, and Meiya were also pulled higher. As a result, compared to the morning closing prices for immediate delivery, Huaxin, Meiya, Zhongsi, China Textile, Qinxing, and Underwear rose by about 5%. Yong Yarn, Xinnuo, Huafeng, Commercial Press, Matches, Jinglun, Xinguang, French, Xinhua, Rongfeng, Tongyi, and Zhabei Lian'an rose slightly. Jingfu and Fengshang were flat, and Xinyi fell slightly. For forward delivery, Xinguang, Huafeng, Dongxing were flat, and Yong Yarn, Xinnuo, Meiya, and Jingfu rose slightly. The rises and falls of old stocks in the open market were mixed.

Arbitrage trading was not active yesterday as long positions were liquidated quickly. The discount rate fell as a result, with the combined interest rate at about 1 jiao 4 to 1 jiao 9, while long positions required 1 jiao 7 to 2 jiao 4. Yong Yarn opened at 12 yuan and fell from 12 yuan 5 to close at 9 yuan 8. Meiya fell from 22 yuan to 17 yuan, ending at 18 yuan. Xinguang was around 1 yuan 5, and Xinnuo fell from 7 yuan 5 to 5 yuan 5.

### Domestic Bonds Fall, Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise

Series C opened at 15,700 yuan, with a high of 16,000 yuan and a low of 14,900 yuan, eventually struggling around 15,200 yuan. The total turnover was about 3 million yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices, Series A and B fell by 400 yuan, and Series C, D, and E each fell by 300 yuan.

Foreign stocks initially traded flat and then rose. Ewo Yarn opened at 166,000 yuan and rose from 165,000 yuan to close at 171,000 yuan. This was because gold and banknotes gradually rebounded, and the black market was stimulated again. Yarn, flower, and securities companies were buyers, while foreign merchants and money exchangers were sellers. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices, Paper was flat, and Ewo Yarn, Ewo Beer, Navigation, and Land Reclamation rose by 5% each. British Union, Deji, Guang Steel rose slightly.

### Tea Market Turns Lively

Foreign Tea Market: Recently, although foreign firms such as China Tea Company and Yongxing Tongfu have been actively buying, the sellers have been stubbornly holding firm, so transactions have been sporadic. It is learned that British Jardine Matheson is also preparing to collect this year's Keemun black tea, and it is reported that Zhenhe Tea has also planned to collect samples and submit them to the company for selection. As for domestic tea, which has been stagnant for a long time, it is still thriving due to the sales in the local market and by out-of-town buyers, and there is no sign of a sharp decline. Prices remain firm.

### Rayon Rises, Silk Remains Stable

Yesterday, the rayon market rose again. Due to the United Company's replenishment of materials and labor, silk factories were very interested in buying, so the market rose as soon as it opened. The 120 brand Ziyouguang first bid 72 million yuan, and the closing price at noon was 66 million yuan. The market continued to advance in the afternoon, and the final selling price was 79 million yuan, 7 million yuan higher than the previous day's closing price.

Yesterday, the market for factory-made silk was similar to the previous day. Only small lots were traded at 58 million to 59 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rise in rayon prices, sentiment turned around, and the transaction price for small lots was 40 million yuan, which had not been done at the opening.

Yesterday, the silk market opened flat. Daizhai and Huaqiang silk fabrics traded around 21 million yuan, fluctuating between 110,000 and 150,000 yuan.

Yesterday, high-grade goods reached 50,000 yuan, and other goods also improved.

### Out-of-Town Buyers Purchase, Market Rises; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Recover After Weakness; 42s Blue Phoenix Rebounds by 1.3 Million Yuan

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market rebounded as a result of the previous day's excessive decline. The market opened with bargain hunting, and out-of-town buyers, especially those from Hankou, purchased actively, so the market rose. As a result, 42s Blue Phoenix yarn rose to 31.8 million yuan, a round increase of 1.3 million yuan from the previous day. 20s Double Horse yarn rose by 400,000 yuan, and other counts of coarse and fine yarns also recovered by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan to over 1 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened with weak sentiment, and the market was initially sluggish. Later, upon hearing that the prices of Fangjian Company were high, with second-grade printed poplin priced as high as 980,000 yuan, printed twill at 1.04 million yuan, Five Fortune B brand fine cloth at 735,000 yuan, and 12-pound Dragon Head fine diagonal at 810,000 yuan, which were not much different from market prices, sentiment improved, and merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, and retail investors raised prices, with Dragon Head fine cloth rising to 880,000 yuan, an increase of 32,000 yuan from the previous day. Five Fortune Colorful Ball and other brands also improved by 15,000 to 31,000 or 2,000 yuan. Fabrics with active sales also showed strength.

It is learned that the team has now completed its work and returned to Shanghai. It is said that detailed lists of each factory are currently being prepared and will be submitted to the Fangjian Company headquarters by the end of this month, so that they can be combined with the valuation lists of other factories belonging to the headquarters and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.

Spot Cotton is Stable and Weak. Yesterday, the spot cotton market improved because the cotton yarn market recovered after weakness, and yarn factories were slightly more interested in buying, so transactions improved, but credit had been unusually tight for the past week, and sellers were eager to sell, so prices lacked the strength to rise, and the trend remained soft. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,350 bales, with factory delivery prices trading at 4 million to 4.15 million yuan, and warehouse delivery prices trading at 4 million, 4.05 million to 4.19 million yuan.

The supply of coal is very normal, so in recent days, general coal prices have fallen by 30% compared to the highest prices.

### Commercial Briefs

The Shanghai Portland Cement Trade Association, due to the gradual shortage of Portland cement in the market, sent a letter to the Cement Association, asking it to find ways to manufacture it. Yesterday, the association's standing committee decided to designate Shunjing Cement Factory to find ways to supply it. Currently, the factory can produce 200 to 300 tons of Portland cement per month. If demand increases sharply in the future, production can be increased continuously. 40,000 pounds are generated, and it will be shipped to the United States for sale on the 23rd.

Loan discounts have been slightly tightened, and the targets of the tightening are: 1. Manufacturers whose manufactured goods have not yet been sold; 2. Manufacturers with particularly high profits. The amount of loans that the association has currently recovered is approximately 30 billion yuan, which is approximately one-quarter of the value of goods shipped.

According to the results of this city's yarn market registration, yarn factories currently have over 40,000 pieces in stock, reworked yarn companies have over 20,000 pieces of yarn in stock, and yarn shops have over 3,000 pieces, totaling over 60,000 pieces in the city. In terms of production, state-owned and private yarn factories can produce over 2,000 pieces per day. Based on the current sales volume, it can be sustained for a long period.

### Memories of a Day Under Full Anesthesia

— Wang Juerong

"Little brother, don't be afraid. Fall asleep quietly. When the anesthetic is administered in a moment, take slow, deep breaths. This way, you'll soon lose feeling and won't feel any pain!" A young doctor, speaking in pure Mandarin, said this gently to a patient lying on the operating table, waiting for surgery!

This patient was no more than sixteen or seventeen years old, dressed in a clean, white hospital gown, lying trembling on the operating table, like a lamb tied to an altar, awaiting the priests' slaughter.

Inside the operating room, no one dared to speak casually except for the chief physician. The poor patient felt a deathly silence. Apart from the sound of the doctors washing their hands, he could almost hear his own heart beating!

Gray curtains, soft light, gleaming surgical instruments, nurses wearing large white caps – all the solemnity, silence, and cleanliness became a source of terror for this young patient! At that moment, he felt boundless sorrow in his heart. He thought of his mother, he thought of home, and he regretted coming for the operation. But it was too late. A white mask was placed over his nose, and a peculiar chloroform smell drilled straight into his nasal passages – no, into his heart as well!

At this moment, he forgot his home, forgot his mother. He only wanted to temporarily stop breathing, so that this unfamiliar smell would no longer invade his nose. Truly, he forgot that this smell would alleviate his pain!

However, things were beyond his control. The more he didn't want to breathe, the more rapid his breathing became. At this time, he clearly heard the chief physician talking. He wanted to tell them that he wasn't asleep yet, to please wait before starting. But his mouth wouldn't obey his commands. He wanted to raise his hand to signal, but he couldn't move at all. Only now did he fully understand the true meaning of the common saying "my mouth says something my heart doesn't feel" and "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." Before long, the sound of the conversation grew louder. It was as if the people talking had moved closer to his ear. Then, the sound became as loud as thunder, each word vibrating in his eardrum. Finally, the sound was so loud that he couldn't distinguish the meaning of each word. He only felt like he was on an airplane, flying through the clouds! The dizziness made him lose all feeling, and in that short amount of time, the skilled doctors had smoothly completed their task.

As the surgery was nearing completion, the assistants, alert, had already stopped the anesthetic. The poor little patient regained free air, and his pale face gradually turned rosy. "How necessary free air is for people!" one assistant thought with emotion.

The patient himself felt like he was returning to Earth from another world. The sounds returned to his ears, just as they did before he fell asleep. The sound of people talking went from blurred to faint, from faint to clear. When he was fully awake, the people talking seemed to be slowly moving away from his ear. Eventually, the volume of the sounds returned to normal, and he could gradually move his hands and feet. Of course, he also regained the freedom to speak. He forcefully opened his eyes, wanting to see the world after his brief departure. Indeed, these few minutes of unconsciousness felt like centuries to him! What he found most strange was that the scenery of the world, though still the same, had all turned a sky-blue color, as if he were wearing tinted glasses!

"Close your eyes quickly!" A gentle female voice began to vibrate in his ears: "Someone who has just been anesthetized should sleep quietly. Opening your eyes at this time will damage your eyesight!" These words interrupted the little patient's thoughts. He knew this was a normal phenomenon after anesthesia. But soon he felt uncomfortable because there was no pillow under his head. He asked for a soft pillow. At the same time, he had had nothing to eat for over a dozen hours, from the night before until now, making him feel ravenously hungry. He also asked for some food. All his requests were refused, on the grounds of preventing vomiting!

Heavens! He could endure not having a pillow, but not eating was truly unbearable! "Once I'm discharged, I'm definitely going to have a big meal!" He could only comfort himself with this kind of Ah Q-like thinking.

After all, someone who has been anesthetized is tired. He quickly fell into a deep sleep, sleeping for several hours. When he woke up, it was already dusk. A desolate yellow lamp was lit in the ward. The bedding on the empty beds on either side was piled high, as if someone was hiding inside. A moan came from afar, sending shivers down his spine!

The large trees outside the window rustled from time to time! The poor little patient, away from home for the first time, felt like he was isolated in the wilderness. He thought that someone might have died in the empty bed next to him. He also thought that someone might have died on the bed he was sleeping in just last night! At this time, it became even darker. Outside the window, he couldn't see anything clearly except for clusters of shadows of trees! A cool breeze blew in, and the moaning sound was exceptionally clear, as if it were right next to his left side. It was as if he saw a shadow swaying outside the window. He also seemed to see something squirming inside the white sheet on the empty bed across from him. He covered himself with the blanket. He repeatedly chanted "Czechoslovakia," but the more he chanted, the more awake he became. The more awake he became, the more frightened he felt. Finally, the area where he had been operated on began to ache in waves!

Insomnia is painful. Pain is even more unbearable. Add to that fear, sorrow, and agitation, and this one night, this single night, can truly be said to be the most painful page in the past personal history of this little brother!

Pain increases agitation, agitation causes insomnia, insomnia makes one anxious, and anxiety further increases pain. As a result, the child went from moaning to sobbing, and from sobbing to screaming wildly! He needed someone to keep him company, and he needed the comforting touch of a loving mother even more. He wanted to call for someone, forgetting that he could ring the bell. At this time, he only knew how to curse. He cursed the nurses, he cursed the doctors, and he cursed the ailment that was causing him pain!

His screams alarmed the night-shift head nurse, a kind old nanny. She comforted the little patient. She stroked him. She asked him caringly if the pain was really that severe. She gave him some medicine powder and a few spoonfuls of water. She told him that this was the most effective painkiller and sleeping aid. Then, she sat compassionately by the little patient's side, patting this large baby like a loving mother. Her kind attitude and caring touch gave the little patient enormous comfort! He no longer screamed wildly, no longer felt afraid. The sorrow in his heart was also mostly gone. He felt that there were still people in the world who cared about him! Soon, the pain in the wound gradually subsided, and his upper and lower eyelids gradually came closer together. Finally, he fell asleep peacefully.

The head nurse smiled knowingly, wrapped up the remaining medicine powder – medicine powder that didn't relieve pain at all – glanced at the patient with satisfaction, and walked in the direction of the moaning sound, to another sickroom, to begin her new work of comforting!

Heavens! Who says that sympathy and comfort aren't the most effective painkillers in the world!

Now, the little patient from thirteen years ago has become a doctor who has graduated seven years ago. Thinking of the pain he felt as a patient back then, he wrote this memoir to encourage himself and his colleagues. His conclusion is:

"When you are treating patients, please think about the pain you yourself feel when you are sick!"

### Syphilis and Blood Tests

— Xie Yunshou

In clinical practice, we often encounter patients like this: "Doctor! Can you test my blood?" "Ah! What do you want to test for? If you want to know if you have anemia, you should count red blood cells and hemoglobin; if you want to know if you have malaria or relapsing fever, you should check for malaria parasites and relapsing fever spirochetes; if you want to know if you have typhoid fever, you should do a Widal test; if you want to know the degree of diabetes, you should check blood sugar levels; your doctor needs to decide what you should be tested for based on your symptoms, and then report to the lab before they can start. Otherwise, it's completely clueless. Asking someone to test everything for you is like asking them to read the entire Twenty-Four Histories – where do you even begin!" I talked a lot, and only then did he tell me the purpose of the test: "Doctor! I want to know if there is poison in my blood?" Then I realized that what he wanted was to do a Wassermann test.

The Wassermann test is a standard method for checking for syphilis. Although there have been various modifications since the Wassermann test, it is still an authoritative method. But generally, people don't have a deep understanding of it. Let me write a few things to tell everyone!

If the test result shows syphilis, it is called a positive reaction, indicated by "++". Then look at the degree: there are strong positive (+++), positive (++), and weakly positive (+) distinctions. If there is no syphilis, it is called a negative reaction, indicated by "-".

A positive reaction generally indicates syphilis.

Not every patient with syphilis will show a positive reaction. In the first stage of syphilis, about 20% show a positive reaction; in the second stage of syphilis, during the rash stage, the highest rate is 95-100%; in the third stage of syphilis, the rate is 50-100%; in early latent syphilis, the rate is 28-83%. Therefore, a negative Wassermann test does not mean that someone "definitely does not have syphilis."

Diseases other than syphilis, such as leprosy, advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, scarlet fever, malaria, relapsing fever, cancer, and diabetes, can also sometimes cause a positive result.

Wassermann reactions mostly appear significantly five to six weeks after infection. In other words, before five or six weeks, the Wassermann reaction will always be negative, regardless of whether you have the disease. There is often a type of patient who, after engaging in unsafe sex, worries incessantly and rushes to the doctor to request a blood test. If the doctor doesn't understand the situation and goes ahead with the blood test, the result will be negative. The patient then thinks that he is innocent. In reality, you've been fooled and covered up the virus with a smokescreen, allowing it to incubate and grow. On the one hand, you think you are free of the disease and have sex with your wife, spreading the virus. Isn't this a great injustice?

As mentioned above, a negative reaction doesn't necessarily mean no syphilis; a positive reaction can also occur in other diseases. Moreover, lab reports sometimes have a mark like this: "+/-", which means doubtful. So, even the authoritative Wassermann reaction is unreliable. You should know that investigating diseases doesn't rely solely on one method. Doctors need to investigate in all aspects: for example, the history of past infections, the various changes that are now appearing on the body, and then make a determination. The Wassermann reaction is just a powerful piece of supporting evidence!

What is the reason why Lab A reports a positive result, while Lab B reports a negative result? The operation of the Wassermann reaction is not a simple matter. If the materials used or the equipment applied are inadequate, errors can occur. This is why the two reports may be different!

If someone has had syphilis, even after treatment, a single Wassermann test, even if it is negative, is not reliable. Repeated tests are needed, because after a certain amount of time, the test may still become positive.

People with latent syphilis may have a negative blood test, but an injection of 606 can be given to stimulate the reaction, and then the test may become positive again. This is called a provocative Wassermann reaction.

### Nutritional Disorders in Breastfed Infants (Continued)

— Cheng Hanzhang

Nutritional Disorders in Artificially Fed Infants – Nutritional Imbalance

1.  Breast milk is the best nutrition, and there is no need to worry too much about its intake.

2.  In infants with nutritional imbalance from mixed feeding, the ability to digest milk fat is significantly reduced. Tolerance to carbohydrates is not affected, so the principle is to reduce the fat content of cow's milk and add carbohydrates.

In mild cases, reduce the amount of cow's milk and dilute the milk with 2% grain juice or grain flour juice. Add nourishing sugar, nourishing maltose, malt juice, and Liebig's extract (2-5%). In severe cases, use skim milk or buttermilk, which have less fat, and add malt juice and Liebig's extract. Sometimes, commercially available malt syrup can be used instead of malt juice. The amount of malt juice paste or Liebig's extract added is increased or decreased depending on the nature of the stool. Increase the amount when hard stools are excreted, the so-called soap stools, and decrease the amount when the stools become soft.

Wasting Syndrome

This refers to the progression of nutritional imbalance. The amount of nutrition required for a child's growth should be determined by body weight. Each kilogram of body weight requires 115 to 130 calories.

Breast milk is best. If the breastfeeding power is weak and quickly exhausted, and the infant cannot suck enough milk, then express the breast milk and feed it with a spoon. Also, if development is insufficient due to a particular wet nurse (or breast milk), then replacing it with another wet nurse will easily improve growth.

When it is difficult to obtain enough breast milk, use mixed feeding, adding nourishing sugar, nourishing maltose, Liebig's extract, etc., to diluted cow's milk, i.e., rice milk, gruel milk, or % milk. If artificial feeding is desired, it is best to add a large amount of sugar to skim milk, buttermilk, or Liebig's extract, which have less fat. Infants with wasting syndrome secondary to external nutritional disorders, as described below, respond favorably to nutritional therapy; however, wasting syndrome based on internal abnormal constitution (exudative neurosis) is ineffective even with the latest nutritional therapy. Even breast milk is ineffective, and weakness may even occur. In such cases of primary wasting syndrome, protein therapy has been reported to be effective. Inject horse or human serum into the muscles every other day or every four or five days. The initial amount is 1.0 cubic centimeters, gradually increasing to 5.0. Dr. Kavis reported trying this on nineteen cases of primary wasting syndrome, with ten cases being completely cured. In cases with good results, the body weight curve showed a sharp increase two or three hundred serum injections later. (To be continued)

### A Study of "Kickback"

— Hai Shao

The term "kickback" may seem perplexing at first glance. However, it is quite common in Shanghai, widely used among common people and well-known in teahouses and taverns. To give generously is to wear a virtuous expression; to receive meagerly is to harbor resentment. A brief summary reveals the ways of the world; whether loose or tight, it depicts joy, anger, and scolding. This word, judged by its literal meaning, is unremarkable. But looking at its sound for its meaning reveals its origins. Truly, it is "searching everywhere, wearing out iron shoes, only to find it with no effort at all."

This article takes a small topic and blows it up, seeming somewhat like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. But as the ancients said, "Jiang Ziya met Duke Wen of Zhou and cast his fishing line in Panxi Stream; Han Xin encountered Emperor Gaozu of Han and displayed his talent for restoring order." Latent spirits and soaring swans await their time to move; fortune and misfortune, poverty and success, all depend on fate. "Kickback" imitates the West, and its origins were obscure. As Western culture gradually spread eastward, it began to be commonly used. Although it is a minor matter, it is still related to the flourishing or decline of customs and the rise and fall of the world. Seeing the great in the small has been done since ancient times, and the convergence of wind and clouds is especially intense today. Those who seize the opportunity prosper; this is the meaning of it.

Since the victory, "cocktail parties" have become extremely popular. Those who are fond of delving into things have examined them repeatedly. The wool comes from the sheep's back, and foreigners can naturally explain it. "Kickback" has a long history, so how can we bear to let it be unknown? I happened to read a Western work about the origins of "kickback," so I have translated it to clarify the details. Citing scriptures and allusions is entirely the work of others, and I would not dare to steal their credit. I humbly present the facts as I know them and do my best to promote "virtuous governance." I hope it will amuse you, and readers certainly do not need to pay a TIP.

It is said that TIP is the condensed form of three English words, so a period should be added after each letter when reading it. The original is To Insure Promptness – meaning to ensure (service) quickly. The abbreviation becomes "kickback." In the past, the English custom was that in hotels or cafes, two small boxes would often be hung where guests came and went, to collect extra rewards from customers, and the words TIP were written on them. This is similar to the "incense money box" in our temples, using persuasion to encourage contributions. Although the words are different, the intention is the same.

The English word "TIP" was first used with the meaning of giving by Samuel Rowlands in 1610. Later, George Farquhar in 1706 and William Byrd in 1733 and other writers used "kickback" in plays or writings with the meaning of extra reward. Chronologically, this was during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty. I wonder if people in Shanghai at that time also commonly used "kickback" in their speech?

The old Oxford Dictionary defines TIP as "a small sum of money given to servants, errand boys, etc." To seek more detail, it further says: "An additional sum of money, of an uncertain amount, given to servants, coachmen, or other people’s errand boys, for service or in hope of service."

In summary, we can now have a correct understanding of the word "kickback." For those who want prompt service, "kickback" is the golden brick to knock on the door; this is the first definition. When hoping to obtain certain services, "kickback" is indispensable, throwing a brick to attract jade; this is the second definition. The amount of the "kickback" cannot be fixed, the wall is high and the brick is thick; this is the third definition. Draw inferences from one instance, and you will understand more than half of the way to use "kickback"!

Shanghai is the most prosperous place in the world, always pioneering trends. We might as well expand its definition and say directly: "Kickback" is a small account that guests casually reward to waiters. If used properly, everyone is happy; if used improperly, both sides are harmed. In social situations, in front of girlfriends, it is better to be generous than stingy, and it is better to be generous than frugal. Losing big for small is an ancient warning; a small impatience ruins great plans, and it is even more appropriate to reflect on these words repeatedly and not ignore them because the word is "simple."

When diners give an extra "kickback" on top of the standard three or three more, the courteous waiters in Beijing, Tianjin, and Henan restaurants must straighten their throats and shout loudly, "Additional reward of [number] yuan, thank you...!" The "thank you" is long and strong, with a vigor that is comparable to Yang Yanhui's "calling the Tartar" in the opera "Si Lang Visits His Mother"! The waiter stands at attention, all the way out the door, smiling and bowing, which adds luster to both the host and the guest. This is the positive side of the "kickback" effect. When the guest comes back for the second time, the waiter's impression is deep, and the service will be even more attentive, making the guest feel at home and everyone happy. Every request is answered, and everything is as desired. This is the side-effect of "kickback." If you want the result, you must plant the cause beforehand. Those who are aware of the times should remember this.

In Hong Kong and Guangdong restaurants, in addition to the standard tip, diners often pay a "kickback" to the tea servers in order to curry favor, especially for female patrons. However, the rigid style of "accepting without refusing, receiving without thanking" often amazes outsiders. In fact, Cantonese people call small accounts "hand tremors." How to make the hand tremble depends on the diner's discretion. I don't believe that the recipient can truly "tremble" his hand without feeling joy in his heart!

### Two Lyrics to "Drunken Peach Spring"

— Hu Lu

According to a report from Chengdu, this newspaper, a "Shangri-La" was discovered in the old Guangshan Mountain in Peng County, western Sichuan. Most of the residents fled into the mountains during the war, living together as a clan, self-sufficient, and completely unaware of the current situation and prices. I hereby fill in this verse!

Warfare fills the land with weeping refugees,
Not knowing where to flee?
Who cares that life is cheaper than a pig or sheep,
Corpses lie everywhere!
Shangri-La is suddenly reported in the mountains,
Old Guangshan famous on the mountains.
Means of transportation strain the mind,
A fool's dream that can never be repaid?

Three bags are emptied, with pain and despair,
Longing in vain!
Wealthy tycoons' houses are filled with gold,
Joyfully greedy for the city's madness!
Peach Spring may be good, relying on hard work,
Everyone forgets it with a laugh!
The Southeast has land better than paradise,
Singing and dancing every day!

### How Many Languages Are There in the World?

— Lun

The number of human languages is truly astounding. According to linguists, there are roughly two or three thousand languages.

Modern human languages can generally be divided into world languages, national languages, and ethnic languages. World languages have the widest use, followed by national languages, and then ethnic languages.

Representing world languages are English, Chinese, French, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, German, Dutch, and Portuguese. English is used as a national language by the English, Americans, Irish, Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, and South Africans. In addition, English is also spoken in Africa, India, Oceania, Egypt, China, and the Near East. Approximately 540 million people use English, of whom 170 million use it as their national language. More than 500 million people use Chinese. Although there are many dialects in China, Chinese characters have been introduced to Japan, Korea, and parts of Indochina due to China's past cultural superiority over neighboring countries, thus becoming an international language in the Far East. 107 million people use French. They are distributed in Western Europe, North Africa, Canada, Britain, and Indochina, of which 45 million use French as their national language. 250 million people use Russian, including 90 million who commonly use it as their national language. The range of use is the Slavic peoples, Finland, Romania, part of China, and Iran. 37 million people speak Arabic as their national language. They are distributed in countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. In addition, Arabic is also the academic and religious language of Muslim countries, which have a total population of 200 million people, distributed in a vast region from North Africa in the west to northern India and western China, and from the Balkans to the Malay Archipelago. 80 million people speak Spanish, of which 65 million use it as their national language. There used to be 80 million people who spoke German, but due to the terrible crimes of the fascist empire, German is no longer as popular as it used to be. 60 million people use Dutch, of which 12.5 million in Europe, the Boers of South Africa, and the Dutch East Indies use it as their national language. 45 million people speak Portuguese, of which 36 million use it as their national language.

### The Most Beloved Place

— Shazhou

One summer afternoon, when the great scientist Edison returned home from his laboratory, which had benefited all of humanity, his wife greeted him and said affectionately, "You work too hard, dear. You've been working tirelessly for too long, which is very detrimental to your health. I advise you to find a good place to rest."

"But where should I go?" the great inventor said.

"Wherever you like, choose the place you love most."

"Alright," Edison said with a smile, "I'll leave tomorrow."

The next day, Edison got up early in the morning and went to his laboratory.

### Three-Rank Officials and the County Magistrate

— Yi Feng

The three-rank duties in the Song Dynasty were the lowest-ranking officials in the capital, with a monthly salary of seven hundred coins and half a catty of meat vouchers, which was simply abjectly poor. Someone wrote a poem to mock himself, titled at the post station: "Serving in the three ranks is truly sad, low and lonely, only oneself knows; when will seven hundred coins make one rich? When will half a catty of mutton make one fat?" Unexpectedly, the situation at the bottom actually reached the top, so the court said, "If it's like this, how can we expect integrity?" and actually adjusted the treatment. Furthermore, Academician Shi Manqing also initially worked in this position. The reason was that Shi's initial examination luck was poor. He was reported for cheating in the imperial examination and re-examined, because Shi was one of the few who gained and then lost the position. He was reassigned to the three-rank borrowed post. When Fu Zhao took back the granted imperial boots and clothing, how could these failed candidates not have the sorrow of seeing the fat meat in their mouths being snatched away, so they cried bitterly. Only Shi remained unconcerned, writing a poem: "If one is untalented, just be a three-rank official, seeking a salary is like being a recording secretary? From now on, stop calling me 'Qing Jin', and just ride my horse east, west, south, and north." This Academician Shi, who was praised by Ouyang Xiu after his death as being heroic in life and a spirit after death, was ultimately likeable.

Although a county magistrate is a small official of the seventh rank, in the Ming and Qing dynasties, one still had to be a graduate of the second rank of the orthodox path to obtain the position. Moreover, directly governing the people is precisely the county magistrate's job, scraping the land and skimming profits are much more convenient than for officials in the capital. It's just that counties differ in wealth and the integrity of individuals varies, so while there are many who taste sweetness, throughout history, there must be many who suffer hardships. As a certain short essay says: "Yu Dong, in his youth, became the magistrate of Huarong County, usually jesting and joking, writing a poem: 'The magistrate of Huarong is a mere trifle, most graduates of the third rank are uneducated. The county secretary and registrar are all colleagues, the assistant prefect and deputy prefect are all superiors. In haste, one has no time to swallow cold rice, in leisure, one has a mouth to chew dried fish. A past life's karma, this life's suffering, the magistrate of Huarong is a mere trifle.'" Although this is self-mockery, it is nonetheless full of complaints on the page. Cold rice and dried fish, although bland, are still better than grass roots and tree bark, after all. "Endure the utmost suffering, to become a superior man," it is clear that someone named Yu is not good at being an official.

### Save on Automobiles

— Xiao Kangshi

Automobiles rush recklessly, difficult to move even an inch like a long snake; just listen to the wronged souls weeping below, rigorously practicing economy has boundless virtue!

### Miss America

— Xu Shuyuan

Miss America's Troop Support Movement

In America, soldiers are absolutely the darlings of heaven, which is not because American soldiers are arrogant, but because America indeed reveres soldiers, and American soldiers do indeed have aspects worthy of reverence. First, American soldiers have a very high level of education. Privates have at least graduated from middle school, and those who have graduated from university, worn square caps, black robes, and have academic master's or doctoral titles make up at least three or four out of ten. Second, America uses a conscription system. Privates are all from good families, there are no mercenaries, nor are there substitutes for military service. American soldiers can be called "brave." When they put on their uniforms, they certainly look heroic, but they will never use that tiger skin to scare the common people, because the common soldier in America is also a commoner, not a special class. Moreover, American soldiers are not allowed to bring weapons out of the barracks. Except for duty personnel who have public handguns, all other officers and soldiers are not allowed to carry them. Abusing weapons is the easiest way to corrupt military discipline, and it is difficult to distinguish between good and bad, true and false. With the above two reasons, the status of American soldiers in society is naturally lofty. A high status naturally leads to the admiration of women.

The American women's community has colorful troop support organizations. The most large-scale ones are USO (United Service Organization), the Red Cross, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Women's Club, and also mothers' clubs and sisterhoods that also do troop support work. USO is the one that does the most vigorous troop support work. The staff includes women leaders, parents, students, movie stars, actors, and singing stars. It has many traveling theater troupes that perform USO Shows for free in various military camps and battlefields. Branches are set up in all large and small cities across the United States, managing military dormitories, cafeterias, dance parties, libraries, and medical clinics. There is also a loan department. If a soldier is short of money, he can borrow dozens of dollars from the association. It is called a loan, but in reality, it does not need to be repaid.

I remember when I was recovering in the military hospital at the Santa Ana Air Force Base in California, it was Christmas. Women working for the USO and the Red Cross came to the hospital ward to offer their condolences, asking the patients what gifts they wanted. They could all provide them. Many black soldiers specifically asked for cash, so the working women raised funds from the women's community in the city. After a while, they brought a large sum of American dollars and silver coins, about several thousand dollars, and distributed them to a dozen black soldiers. They often had singing groups come to the hospital wards to perform, and you could request songs. There was also a working woman stationed in the hospital who specialized in teaching popular songs for free, such as "Pistol Packing Mama." All of these women's troop support groups are completely charitable in nature. The staff work for free and even donate large sums of money. Only American women truly do this kind of losing business. They can indeed boost morale and stir up the fighting spirit. If Miss America did not mobilize, MacArthur and Eisenhower would be discouraged.

### National Merchant Shipping Bureau's Reply to Mr. Qian Chaozhen

[Letter] Read Mr. Qian Chaozhen's letter "Please Provide Services for Elderly and Weak Passengers at the Merchant Shipping Bureau" published in the Social Services section of your newspaper on October 18th, noted with gratitude. We are enclosing the Bureau's reply for your reference and publication. We would be immensely grateful. Respectfully addressed to the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao Newspaper, Social Services Section, National Merchant Shipping Bureau.

Regarding the "no sending-off guests onto the ship" clause, it is a measure that this Bureau is forced to take in order to maintain order on the ship and consider the safety of passengers. Otherwise, anyone can board the ship. Not only will the order on the ship be disrupted, but pickpockets will also infiltrate. Moreover, passengers who have purchased tickets will board the ship and refuse to disembark, exceeding the ship's passenger limit and hindering navigational safety, so we must strictly restrict it. As for "providing services for elderly and weak passengers," this Bureau has previously instructed the pier police and service staff on each ship that they should assist and care for elderly, weak, and young passengers boarding and disembarking. However, there are many passengers, and there may be oversights, for which we deeply apologize. In addition to reiterating the order to pay attention at all times, we hereby issue a public reply, hoping for your understanding!
