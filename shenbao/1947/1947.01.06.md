### The Majority of Military Reorganization Work Completed; Executive Headquarters and Pacification Headquarters Scale Back; Northeast Executive Headquarters Implements New System

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Following the Political Consultative Conference's resolution, the government implemented military reorganization, reducing groups into armies, armies into divisions, and divisions into brigades. This has been largely completed. Preparations for establishing peacetime national defense division and regimental districts are also underway successively. The conditions for the nationalization of the military are generally in place. According to the military reorganization plan, the Chairman's Executive Headquarters and Pacification Commissioner's Offices should be abolished immediately. However, due to the complex task of pacifying refugees in various pacification zones, and because the Executive Headquarters and Pacification Commissioner's Offices have traditionally served as military-political institutions, their immediate abolition would impact the facilities in the pacification zones. Therefore, the authorities have decided to temporarily retain them, but their scope will be reduced as appropriate. It is reported that the General Affairs and Military Law Departments of the original Executive Headquarters and Pacification Commissioner's Offices will retain their original names. The Political Affairs Department will be renamed the Civil Affairs Department, and the Political Department will be renamed the Press Department. All inspection offices will be abolished, and their duties will be integrated into relevant departments. The number of personnel to be reduced will be about one-third, and this is expected to be implemented soon.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th] After the Northeast Executive Headquarters was ordered to reorganize, it implemented a new system starting from the 5th. The former Secretariat and the five departments of Military Affairs, Personnel, Intelligence, Transportation, and Aviation Police were abolished. The Logistics Department will be temporarily closed due to business reasons. The General Affairs and Military Law Departments remain as before. New offices have been established for the Chief of Staff's Office and four departments numbered (1), (2), (3), and (4). Apart from personnel changes, this reorganization has reduced both the establishment and expenses. The number of surplus personnel reached over two hundred, accounting for more than half of the total number of former employees.

### The Youth Party's Participation in the Government Is Principally Determined; Dong Biwu Meets with Reporters to Explain the Communist Party's Position

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The issue of the Youth Party's participation in the government will be discussed and decided at the upcoming Central Executive Committee meeting. The party headquarters has become increasingly lively as representatives from various regions gather. Mr. Yu Jiaju, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the party, told reporters yesterday that the party's participation in the government has been determined in principle. This is because all parties and factions have an obligation to contribute to ending political tutelage and implementing constitutional government. However, the specific technical aspects of how to participate in the government are still under study. To put it plainly, the party hopes that its participation in the government will truly benefit the country and have a positive and beneficial effect on promoting constitutional government. Mr. Yu also said that the issue of participating in the government has only been mentioned in private conversations between government representatives and members of the party. No formal discussions have been held to date. He believes that one cannot be easily optimistic about the overall situation, but there is always a path to be found, and true peace will eventually be realized.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] In recent days, many government officials have traveled to Shanghai to engage with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party as they hold meetings in Shanghai. As a result, the political center of gravity has clearly shifted to Shanghai. After arriving in Nanjing, Zhang Zhizhong visited various people, including Wu Yuru today, and attended a dinner hosted by Ambassador Stuart in the evening, accompanied by Pi Zonggan and others. In addition, Liu Dongming and others from the Youth Party traveled to Shanghai by car tonight to discuss matters with party members who remained in Shanghai.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Communist Party representative Dong Biwu held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 5th to report on the Yellow River damming issue and to issue a written statement (full text in the second section), and answered reporters' questions as follows:

Q: What is the new basis for peace talks?

A: The Communist Party still takes the dissolution of the National Assembly and the restoration of the military situation to the state of January 13th as the basis. Since the Communist Party put forward these two points, it has not yet received a definite reply from the government.

Q: Is Shao Lizi's visit related to the peace talks?

A: No, it's purely a New Year's greeting. I also returned the visit on the 3rd, but did not meet.

Q: Will General Zhang Zhizhong be visited after he arrives in Beijing?

A: I intend to pay my respects because during the Sheng Shicai era, more than one hundred Communist Party members were detained and released through Zhang's exchange, which is deeply appreciated.

Q: The National Assembly has closed, and the peace talks have not reopened. What are your views on the new situation?

A: There is no hope for peace talks.

Q: Of the two conditions insisted upon by the Communist Party, the National Assembly has already convened. What is the Communist Party's view on this?

A: It can be regarded as a historical event.

Q: Do you recognize the new constitution?

A: No.

Q: How much does the basic spirit of the new constitution differ from the Political Consultative Conference's constitutional draft?

A: They are fundamentally incompatible.

Q: If Zhang Zhizhong raises the issue of peace talks during the visit, what will the Communist Party's response be?

A: It will depend on the situation.

Q: What is your opinion on the Bai Chongxi incident?

A: It's completely fabricated. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### Zhang Qun Visits Zhang Junmai to Discuss Reorganizing the Government

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Since arriving in Shanghai, Zhang Qun has been in frequent contact with people from various parties and factions to inquire about their opinions on reorganizing the government. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Zhang drove to Fan Garden to visit Zhang Junmai for a long talk of several hours.

### Before Government Reorganization, Peace Talks Should Be Restored First

CLA's Zhang Bojun Expresses His Views

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Zhang Bojun of the China Democratic League (CDL) told reporters yesterday: "The CDL believes that peace talks should be restored first, and then the government should be reorganized. If the government continues to reorganize in the manner of the National Assembly, without the full participation of all parties and factions, the situation will not be satisfactory. This opinion has been formally communicated to Mr. Lei Zhen and Mr. Zhang Qun. After a nationwide ceasefire and peace are realized, the CDL will definitely participate in the government. Before peace is achieved, if there is an objective need, the CDL will never give up its responsibility to mediate between the KMT and the CPC." Zhang continued: "In order to expand its organization and coordinate the opinions of its members, the preparatory meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the CDL decided that all members should join the League in their individual capacity, rather than participating in the name of groups. In this way, members of other organizations can also join and become members of the CDL. However, this method does not apply to members of the CCP, because the CCP has a particularly strong party spirit, and its members do not have the freedom to decide their opinions."

[Another Dispatch] The Second Plenary Session of the CDL is scheduled to formally open at 9:00 AM this morning. A total of thirty-six central committee members and representatives from local general branches will attend. Last night, the standing committee members of the League held a discussion meeting and decided that the location of the meeting would be kept strictly confidential. The opening ceremony will be presided over by Chairman Zhang Lan. After the election of the presidium, the central departments of the League will present reports, and the local general branches will present reports tomorrow. Proposals will be reviewed and issues discussed on a daily basis thereafter. The session will last for five days, and a declaration will be issued at the closing session, expressing the CDL's attitude towards the current situation.

### The Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council Continues to Hold Review Meetings; Li Tang, Ling Hongxun, and Others Attend and Answer Questions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council held its fourth temporary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 5th to continue reviewing the national general budget. Shao Lizi, Qian Gonglai, Fu Sinian, and others attended. Li Tang, Minister of Finance, Ling Hongxun, Minister of Transportation, Jiang Wanping, Director of the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Transportation, Sun Zheng, Member of the Resources Committee, Zhang Junwen, Director of the Accounting Department, and Ji Shuno, Technical Expert, attended. First, Fan Yusui reported on the doubts that the second group of the review team still had about transportation, forestry, and the Resources Committee, and requested immediate answers. Ling Hongxun said: Among the state-owned enterprises, only the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway can barely maintain itself. All others require subsidies. It seems inappropriate to include the airline companies and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the budget. Zuo Shunsheng said: This budget is extremely incomplete. The income of the Highway Administration is estimated at ten million, while the expenditure is 2.5 billion, which is unreasonable. Li Tang said: This is an ordinary budget, not an operating budget, but there are also inconsistencies in the preparation. Yin Shuxian said: The problem is not whether the preparation is consistent or not, but whether it is coordinated or not. All agencies only have how much they spend, but not how much they earn. It is impossible to know their income and expenditure, and it is impossible to use income to make up for the budget deficit during the review. Jiang Wanping said: It should be coordinated, but there are still many technical difficulties in preparing an operating budget. Peng Gechen asked how much was not included in the budget, and why was it not included? Fan Yusui asked why the operating income budget was not included, so it becomes a private business, and there is no benefit to the state business. Gan Jiaqing said: The Savings and Remittance Bureau is not included. Is it considered a part of the national general budget? Jiang Wanping then explained why the operating budget of the Savings and Remittance Bureau was not included. Fan Yusui then pointed out that the peasant bank in the budget only has 500 million in income, and the Industrial Bank and the Commercial Bank only have 2 million. The actual numbers are definitely not this low. Dai Mingli replied: The peasant bank has very little interest, so the income is low. The Industrial Bank and the Commercial Bank are jointly operated by the government and private businesses. The profit is not known until the end of the year. Regarding why the China Tobacco Factory is included in the budget of the Ministry of Finance, it is because it was a factory jointly invested by the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing several years ago with 5,000 shares, and the government shares have not yet been fully repaid, so it must still be included in the budget of the Ministry of Finance. Someone asked if the Ministry of Finance has ever asked about the price of gold allocated by the four banks, and why is the financial market so chaotic? If it has the right to ask, then who holds this right? Dai Mingli replied: The income from the sale of gold is turned over to the national treasury, and the management is handled by the Joint Logistics Office and the Central Bank. The figures and income and expenditure will be reported by a dedicated person. The budget item of the Resources Committee was then raised as being "too simple," with an income of 30 billion and an expenditure of more than 200 billion, which is not realistic. Zhang Junwen said: 30 billion is the income from the group's operations, which is also the capital of the business. Someone suggested that if it doesn't make money, it's better to close it down. Zhang said: State-owned enterprises are not just for money. Then Qian Gonglai and others said that the Resources Committee cannot be closed. The meeting was adjourned immediately. The second review meeting continued in the afternoon, and it was decided that a plenary meeting would be held at 9:00 AM on the 6th, and all the review work would be completed.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Sun Lianzhong left Beiping by special plane on the morning of the 5th to fly to Beijing to report on his work to the central government. He will return to Beiping in the near future. The situation in Hebei Province has recently been in a state of confrontation. In key areas such as the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, although the number of Communist troops is six to one compared to the National Army, the strength is relatively balanced. Although the Communist army has activities, it is difficult to achieve major gains except for the contention of small strongholds. The government is working hard to grasp the political grassroots and coordinate the effective cooperation of party, government, military, and youth organizations. Sun flew to Beijing after completing this plan.

The case has accumulated like a mountain and has not been captured. Various groups have filed a complaint with the court for handling according to the law. As for the insult to personal matters, in this era of freedom of speech, one should examine oneself according to right and wrong, and listen to slander without answering. However, if it exceeds the scope, one should also be responsible in law. I am sincerely afraid that you are not aware of the truth, so I present the case and ask you to handle it carefully.

### Zhang Pingqun's Speech in the United States: Our Situation Shows Significant Progress, Presents Three Hopes to American Friends

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] Zhang Pingqun, our Consul General in New York, delivered a speech titled "Prospects for Peace in China" to 500 members of the Foreign Policy Association in Boston today. Zhang stated: The Chinese people sincerely hope that American friends can continue their economic cooperation. Harvard University Professor John King Fairbank and Michael Lindsay also expressed their opinions in their individual capacities. Zhang presented three hopes to American friends today: (1) American friends must understand the truth about the situation in China and the Chinese problem, because there are often differences between words and intentions, and propaganda is a specialty of the Communist Party. Therefore, such true understanding is especially necessary today. (2) We hope that the United States will cooperate in China's economic recovery, at least in undertakings that are not related to military affairs, because such undertakings clearly restore China's industrial development and improve the lives of ordinary people. (3) It is hoped that American friends can use their wisdom to distinguish the various statements made by those with prejudice. Zhang stated: The Communist Party problem in China has become much clearer than before, and he firmly believes that the hope for peace is also brighter than before, because the real situation in China has progressed. The Chinese government is still prepared to resolve the Communist Party problem through political means in order to achieve China's unification. If a political solution cannot be achieved, we will use other means to achieve unification. Zhang also discussed the pre-war construction achievements of our government, saying: Some American journalists have failed to inform the American people of the Chinese government's efforts in construction, which is truly unfortunate. Zhang cited as an example that in the years before the war, the central government implemented policies to teach farmers to use more advanced agricultural equipment and improve land utilization.

### Far East International Military Tribunal, Trial of Japanese War Criminals, Mei Ru'ao Talks to Reporters in Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Dr. Mei Ru'ao, Judge of the Far East International Military Tribunal, returned to China from Japan the other day and arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the evening of the 4th. As the work of the Tokyo trial is becoming increasingly intense and is about to enter the defendant's defense phase, he will leave Nanjing next week and go to Shanghai to return to Japan. Mei's trip was a return to China taking advantage of the court's New Year holiday to report to our government authorities on the organization and recent situation of the Far East International Tribunal, and to collect the materials needed for the trial.

This reporter recently interviewed Mei at the Legislative Yuan and spoke freely about the trial situation of the Far East International Military Tribunal and his personal views on the trial of Japanese war criminals. The military tribunal is entirely international, composed of representatives from eleven countries. Because it specializes in trying Japanese top-level war criminals, the words "Far East" were added to the International Military Tribunal to distinguish it from the Nuremberg International Tribunal.

Entering the Defense Phase

Since the Tokyo International Tribunal officially began its trial on June 3 of last year, it has been seven months. The evidence provided by the prosecution, the indictment phase of the trial, has come to an end, and the defendant's defense phase will begin soon, which is expected to take four months. Finally, the stage of reviewing the evidence, sentencing, and execution is simpler, and will take about one to two months to complete. Therefore, the work of the International Tribunal is expected to be completed in May or June of this year. Mei stated: There were originally a total of 28 top-level Japanese war criminals tried by the court, but since Matsuoka Yosuke died of illness, and Okawa, due to mental illness, has not been tried since he assaulted Tojo at his first court appearance. Okawa's mental illness is said to be gradually improving, and he will definitely continue to be tried and sentenced in the future. Therefore, at the stage of indictment, there are always only 26 people present for trial, six of whom served as prime ministers, and the rest were cabinet ministers. Because the implications are extremely broad and the collection of evidence is quite complicated, the work is extremely busy. The prosecution has provided more than 2,000 pieces of evidence and documents, and the records are more than 16,000 pages long. About 100 witnesses have also been subpoenaed. The work will be even more intense when the debate begins in court in the future. During the indictment phase, the defendants only attended the hearings and did not speak. At this time, they will present the most favorable evidence and make full defenses. Each defendant has hired American and Japanese lawyers. If a defendant does not hire a lawyer himself, General MacArthur will definitely become the appointed defense lawyer. Currently, the 54 lawyers for the defendants are all extremely famous. On the Japanese side, most are law professors or presidents of law associations at Japanese Imperial Universities, and are the top-tier lawyers in Japan. It is expected that there will be a fierce debate at that time.

Reasons for Slow Progress

Mei explained in detail the reasons for the slow progress of the court's trial work. According to him: The main reasons are as follows: (1) The case is too complicated and involves too much. In terms of time, although it is stipulated that it starts from the "September 18th Incident" when Japan invaded China until the surrender in this war, the historical facts of the distant cause of the "September 18th Incident," the assassination of Zhang Zuolin in Huanggutun, have also been searched, traced, analyzed, and stated. In terms of space, it can be said that it stretches from the Songhua River to the South Seas Islands, involving many countries. Therefore, the evidence presented is numerous and complex, and processing it is time-consuming and requires time. (2) Language relations: In addition to using English, because the language of the defendant must be used at the same time according to law, both English and Japanese are usually used. The translation, interpretation, and proofreading are most time-consuming. Even some foreign witnesses require several translations. For example, Yi Zhizhi testified for eight days, but actually only spoke for two days. The rest of the time was spent on translation. The situation of Vice Minister Qin Dechun's testimony was also the same. He attended the court for five days, but only needed to speak for one day. (3) The Anglo-American litigation procedure is thorough and pays the most attention to concrete and sufficient evidence. This is fully provided by the eleven countries, so there are as many as 2,000 pieces, and the records of more than 16,000 pages are far more than the Nuremberg International Tribunal. (4) Institutional relations: Adopting opposition interrogation, also known as "cross-examination," is not available in China and other continental countries. Under this system, the defendant's lawyers can interrogate the witnesses and ask questions that are most favorable to the defendant. The defendant's lawyers can refute the testimony reasonably and cite facts and attack. They can also question the credibility and personality of the witness and attack them to reduce the witness's identity, qualifications, and strength, and indirectly increase the defendant's favorable position. For example, asking the witness whether he has committed a crime, whether he has a mental illness, whether he has had venereal diseases, etc. The 54 defendants' lawyers try their best to attack the weaknesses of the witnesses, which is also the reason for the slow progress. (5) In some areas among the eleven prosecuting countries, the viewpoints on jurisprudence are not unified, and conflicts or repetitions inevitably occur, which makes the work progress even more slowly.

Presenting Two Concepts

Finally, Mei presented two points of view on the work of the Tokyo International Tribunal: First, President Truman once declared: The Nuremberg trial of war criminals was one of the greatest events of the Second World War, and the Americans listed the Nuremberg trial of war criminals as one of the major events of 1946, but the Tokyo Tribunal is also in the same important position, consuming a lot of manpower, material resources, and intelligence, and using various new scientific equipment, such as printing, translation, photography, etc. Its main purpose is definitely not just the life and death of 26 Japanese war criminals, but to establish or consolidate the principles of international law, to make the already unclear principles of international law clearer, and to further promote them. The main principle is that "aggressive war is a crime." Second, anyone who participates in the war is also a criminal, regardless of planning, execution, conspiracy, or promotion of national superior culture, inciting aggressive war, etc. In addition to the legal responsibility of the country, individuals should also be guilty. After the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of the Second World War, individual actions that affect the international peace order must also be subject to legal sanctions. Here, we have obtained a definite conclusion.

### Resident Autonomy Trial in Various Districts of Hong Kong's New Territories

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 5th Special Dispatch] The Hong Kong government is piloting resident autonomy in various districts of the New Territories. It has already been implemented on Tai O Island. General elections were held in the Cheung Chau district on the 3rd, with the Deputy District Officer of the New Territories, Aitcheson, supervising the election. The meeting place followed our country's assembly methods. The national flag and the Prime Minister's portrait were hung in the auditorium. First, each neighborhood selected 100 candidates in proportion to the population, who were also members of the small group. Then, seven people were selected to form a residents' association. If residents have any problems, they will first be submitted to the small group members, and then to the residents' association for resolution. This autonomy will continue to be held in various places.

[Another Dispatch] The Hong Kong government has formulated a five-year plan for the New Territories, which focuses on increasing production and reducing dependence on external assistance.

### Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Pingjin Area Total Over Two Trillion Yuan, Sun Yueqi Discusses Handling Process

[This City News] Sun Yueqi, director of the Pingjin Area Enemy and Puppet Industries Handling Bureau, recently went to Beijing from Pingjin on official business and came to Shanghai along the way. Yesterday, he met with a Central News Agency reporter at his residence in Shanghai and briefly described the bureau's handling of enemy and puppet industries over the past year as follows: The bureau was established in Pingjin in December of the year before last and successively established offices in Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, and Taiyuan. Although the entire enemy and puppet industry in the above-mentioned places has not yet reached the final settlement period, according to current estimates, its total value can exceed at least two trillion yuan or more, most of which are real estate, such as factories, mines, and real estate. The amount processed and delivered to the national treasury is approximately 240 billion yuan, most of which is gold and silver, worth approximately 90 billion yuan. The rest is houses, factories, and daily necessities. Among them, daily necessities account for the largest proportion of income. There are more than 100 factories, and various methods such as material valuation, consignment notes, bidding, and auctions are used. Factories and houses are all sold by bidding. If they have not been successfully bid out twice, the method of negotiated purchase is used to resolve the issue. In addition, the handling of factory and real estate disputes, which have been returned to the original owners, has been completed in more than 3,000 cases. This work can be considered to have come to an end. Furthermore, production industries, such as Tianjin Huaxin and other seven yarn factories, have been allocated to the China Textile Construction Company, which owns 300,000 spindles in total. In addition, Kai, which produces 12,000 tons of coal per day, and Jingxing, which produces 2,000 tons of coal per day, have also been allocated to the National Resources Commission and the Hebei Provincial Government for joint management. The Jibei Power Plant, which uses high-voltage lines to connect Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan and generates more than 13,000 degrees of electricity, has been repaired and will soon be fully operational. The North China Iron and Steel Plant, which can produce more than 8,000 tons of steel per day, has also been allocated to the National Resources Commission. Sun estimated that the general closing date of the bureau's branches would be around June of this year, and the reason for the delay was that the handling procedures in the local offices were more difficult.

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 5th] The handling of enemy properties in Pingjin has not been completed, and the Handling Bureau will not be closed down for the time being. According to the person in charge of the bureau: The bureau's business scope includes not only Beiping, but also Taiyuan and Zhangjiakou, etc. The scope of Tianjin is wider than that of Shanghai, and the handling of affairs is also more complicated than that of Shanghai. Because the Shanghai Bureau was established earlier than the Beiping Bureau, the handling aspect is also simpler. It has been mostly completed in one year. The Pingjin District Bureau has only handled three-quarters in one year. Except for the traitor properties, which have not been handled in one case due to their connection with judicial procedures, the remaining enemy and puppet materials have been sold in stages and have reached the eighth stage. Based on the situation in Pingjin, it is feared that it will not be able to close down at present. According to the handling deadline, it will take another half a year to complete the bidding and purchasing of scattered materials and small factories. Director Sun Yueqi also went to Beijing to ask for instructions on whether the Pingjin District Bureau should extend the deadline.

### Yellow River Damming and Restoration Problems, Dong Biwu Issues Statement, Requests Government to Allocate Funds Quickly

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Communist Party representative Dong Biwu held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 5th and issued a written statement on the Yellow River damming problem. The main points are as follows: "The damming and restoration of the Yellow River must be carried out in coordination. The two major and arduous tasks of downstream dike restoration and relocation and relief of riverside residents cannot be completed in a few months; however, since the Shanghai Agreement in July, the government authorities have (1) delayed in allocating funds, and the 'Liberated Area' has advanced 4.9 billion for the initial dike restoration project, and the second phase of project funds has not been paid at all; (2) the Shanghai Agreement promised to allocate 15 billion yuan for the relief of riverbed residents from August to December last year, which has been delayed and unpaid; (3) destroying the project and attacking the 'Liberated Area'. Finally, according to reports, the Huayuankou began to release water on December 27 last year, flooding downstream residents. Huang Biwu, chairman of the 'Liberated Area' Relief Committee, made a serious protest to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Executive Headquarters (ExHq), and the Water Conservancy Commission, and put forward five suggestions: (1) immediately stop the damming and water release work and investigate the responsibility for the water release; (2) the damming of the Huayuankou must be delayed until five months later, otherwise the government will be responsible for the consequences; (3) the 15 billion yuan for the relief of riverbed residents must be paid quickly; (4) the dike restoration funds should be distributed fairly and reasonably according to the length of the dike line and the size of the project; (5) the materials and equipment provided by UNRRA to assist us in controlling the Yellow River should be delivered directly to the 'Liberated Area'." This letter has been sent separately, but there has been no reply.

[This City News] Wu Yunfu, the central government's representative stationed at ExHq, held a press conference at Zhou Enlai's residence on Sinan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the current situation of the Yellow River damming project. Wu also issued a letter from CPC representative Dong Biwu to ExHq, the content of which can be divided into: (1) The CPC has not made preparations for the Yellow River damming work, and the problem of restoring the Yellow River to its old course is that there are many residents in the area. If relocation is to be handled, the expenses will be huge. Therefore, the project to restore the Yellow River to its old course is extremely difficult; (2) The government previously promised to allocate 150 billion yuan for the Yellow River control project, but has not allocated a penny to date. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will quickly allocate this amount to facilitate the project.

Editorial

### Municipal Administration in the Year of Democratic Constitutionalism

The second Shanghai Municipal Assembly is set to open today. The convocation of this assembly of popular will coincides with the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, marking the beginning of the so-called year of democratic constitutionalism. Its profound significance is self-evident. Although the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly predates the Constitution's promulgation, the election of municipal assembly members, the establishment of the Municipal Assembly, and its past achievements have fully demonstrated the spirit of democratic constitutionalism. The convocation of this second assembly comes at the heels of the completion of the constitutional project. Upholding the spirit of constitution-making and the Constitution itself, it will undoubtedly set a precedent for democratic constitutionalism. The normal course of constitutionalism is that the people have rights, and the government has competence. While the Municipal Assembly is a form of local autonomy, it is inextricably linked to the rise and fall of national constitutionalism. The soundness of national politics is founded on the soundness of local politics. Britain, despite lacking a written constitution, serves as a model of modern constitutionalism. Although the factors involved are complex, the soundness of local politics is a major key. The development of modern British constitutionalism is built on the foundation of sound local politics. This stands in stark contrast to the development in continental Europe, especially France. Now, the convocation of the second Shanghai Municipal Assembly coincides with the beginning of our year of democratic constitutionalism. It is hoped that the convocation of this Municipal Assembly will lead to a sounder municipal administration in Shanghai.

To ensure the soundness of municipal administration, the assembly representing the will of the citizens must be able to exert its effectiveness. This requires the Municipal Assembly itself to make good use of its powers, and the municipal authorities, in particular, must conscientiously abide by the spirit of the Assembly's resolutions and implement them effectively. Under a democratic government, the people are the masters, and the government must govern in accordance with the people's will. The Municipal Assembly, composed of representatives elected by the citizens, is in effect the highest authority in the city. All municipal facilities should be subject to the decisions of the Assembly. Even if the municipal authorities are not directly subordinate to the Assembly, they are merely agencies for executing policy decisions. In the past, the "Shanghai Municipal Council" of the Public Concession was a representative body elected by taxpayers, and all the municipal affairs of the "Public Concession" were decided by this representative body and implemented by directly subordinate departments. Now, we have the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Assembly, a body representing public opinion. In addition to handling cases assigned by the central government, the Shanghai Municipal Government should be subject to the Municipal Assembly on all municipal facilities. Now that we are at the beginning of the year of democratic constitutionalism, and Shanghai is the premier city in the country, the Municipal Assembly should actively exert its effectiveness in promoting Shanghai's municipal administration in the future. If someone says, "The Municipal Government is the big boss, and the Assembly is the boss," that is undemocratic. If we can use old titles to express our meaning, then the Municipal Assembly should be the "big boss," and the Municipal Government is just the "bosses'" errand boy.

Speaking of Shanghai's municipal administration, there are truly a thousand threads and myriad things waiting to be done. Today, the rugged and uneven roads of Shanghai are a reflection of the city's myriad problems. The sole task of the current Shanghai Municipal Assembly is to revive municipal administration. In order to revive municipal administration, there must be large expenditures. Therefore, the main task of this convocation of the Municipal Assembly is to review the budget submitted by the Municipal Government. The size of the figures is unprecedented in the history of Shanghai's municipal development, and even compared with the budget of the capital, Nanjing, it is astounding. It is well known that government finances do not follow the principle of private finance of living within one's means; however, government finances cannot ignore the people's ability to bear the burden, and should not neglect the cultivation of tax sources. According to newspaper reports, the budget submitted by the Municipal Government totals 230 billion yuan, of which 123.1 billion yuan are covered by regular income, and 86.9 billion yuan, accounting for one-third of the total budget, must rely on temporary income to supplement it. In today's declining industry and commerce, we hope that the Municipal Assembly will carefully consider the submission of this huge budget. Those involving necessary municipal construction should be maintained, while those used to maintain redundant agencies and retain redundant personnel should be deleted. Although Shanghai is the premier city in the country, there are existing laws to follow regarding the organization of municipal administration. Those agencies and personnel who do not follow the regulations should be eliminated to save public funds.

As for how to rectify tax collection in order to enrich the treasury, the municipal financial authorities should certainly have a comprehensive plan, and the Municipal Assembly should carefully consider it. At present, the tax burden borne by the citizens of Shanghai is often overwhelming. If there are any new tax increases that affect the lives of the general public, it will inevitably provoke resentment among the general public. At a time of democratic withering, the increase of new taxes should be approached with great caution. Rather than thinking about increasing new taxes, how to increase the municipal treasury should actively rectify existing tax collection. Whether there are abuses in the collection of taxes and whether it can be improved are all worth considering. In the collection of taxes, the duplication of tax burdens should be avoided. In the past, the collection of municipal construction surcharges was added to property taxes, water bills, electricity bills, telephone bills, and gas bills. There were surcharges everywhere. A citizen may have to pay five or six construction surcharges of the same name every month, resulting in surcharges and taxes everywhere. This is the culmination of tax duplication and indicates a pathological tax system. The fact that taxes have the name of construction, but where the construction is, is particularly perplexing to the general public. Shanghai's municipal finances should have a way; we should not only think about increasing the burden on the people.

In addition, regarding the various issues of municipal administration that should be implemented and reformed, the mayor has already submitted important cases. The assembly members come from the people and know the hardships of the people. Presumably, they will also submit proposals. Due to the convocation of this Assembly, we not only hope that they will set an example for local autonomy in China, but also set a precedent for democratic constitutionalism in China in the future. How to actively exert the effectiveness of the Municipal Assembly, the convocation of this Assembly will surely have the facts to comfort the hopes of the citizens.

### Yellow River Control Advisory Group Inspects Huayuankou

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th] Savanage and others arrived in Huayuankou from Bian at noon on the 4th to inspect. They visited the Yellow River diversion project into the Wei River for one and a half hours, finishing at 5:00 PM. Savanage stayed overnight in Huayuankou and returned to Bian for Beijing on the 5th. The Yellow River water diverted into the old course has passed Liuyuankou north of Bian and reached the new embankment of Kaifeng. Tadt, an American advisor to the Engineering Bureau, has recently gone to Handan to discuss downstream issues with the Chinese Communist side.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th] Tadt, an advisor to the Yellow River Blocking and Restoration Bureau, recently arrived in Zhengzhou from Handan and conveyed the Communist side's opinion to the bureau that the diversion gate should be closed and the water released after the UNRRA and all parties have discussed it. The diversion gate was washed open by high water levels in Shanzhou upstream on the 28th of last month. The water head was very small and only crossed the Bian-Xin Road on the 5th.

### New Great Wall Beyond the Frontier: Record of a Meeting with General Fu Zuoyi (Part 2)

— Our Newspaper Reporter Yu Zhenji

Holding a Golden Rice Bowl and Begging for Food. General Fu believes that the current situation in Chahar Province is no different from "holding a golden rice bowl and begging for food." He said: Japan did some construction work in Chahar Province, but mainly to build Chahar Province into a colony and extract raw materials. The Japanese built 58 factories in Chahar and left some survey materials. Most of the factories and mines have now been destroyed by the Communist army, especially in Zhangjiakou. The destruction caused by the Communist army in one and a half days is simply not something that can be restored in three to five months. All we got are broken houses and rotten machines. When he mentioned these people, Fu just shook his head and said repeatedly, "It's really a big headache!"

General Fu said in a rather proud tone: Chahar Province's iron ore reserves are the second richest in the country, second only to Liaoning. The Xuanhua coal and iron mine has astonishing reserves and modern iron smelting equipment. It is expected to be repaired in two or three months, and then the ore will be transported to the vicinity of Beiping for smelting. In addition, Chahar Province also has some rare minerals such as mica.

In terms of agricultural products, Chahar Province's millet and wheat are also very famous. Several shipments are transported to Pingjin and other places via the Ping-Sui Railway every day. It is just that there is a lack of good power equipment, and the entire province is in a state of hardship. Therefore, even on the table where Chief Fu invited the press corps to dinner, the steamed buns and rolls were not made of the best white flour. The general himself and several department chiefs at the scene ate one after another, making reporters from Beijing and Shanghai embarrassed not to follow suit.

Currently, the biggest lack in Chahar Province is electricity. In Zhangjiakou alone, there are many, many businesses that cannot be rebuilt because of insufficient electricity. General Fu told us that the Japanese originally had a 65,000-kilowatt power generation plan in Chahar Province, and 40,000 kilowatts had been completed before its unconditional surrender, but currently less than 1,000 kilowatts are in operation, and everything has of course come to a standstill. The provincial government has cooperated with the National Resources Commission to find ways to restore the power plant in Xiahuayuan. It is expected that it will increase to 10,000 kilowatts in the near future, which will be of great benefit to the paralyzed industry.

Most of the Roads Have Been Repaired

Another task being carried out under the leadership of General Fu is the restoration of transportation. The railways from Zhangjiakou to Beiping and from Zhangjiakou to Datong have been repaired recently. The reconstruction of this major artery has indeed brought some American cigarettes and the like to the market, but materials from Shanxi and Chahar Provinces have been able to be transported out in a steady stream, and goods from Hebei and Tianjin have also been transported in continuously. In terms of highways, most of the roads in the province have been hastily repaired. There is a very good highway from Zhangjiakou to Zhangbei to Kulun. The road from Zhangjiakou to Chongli is very bumpy, but this also shows the extent of the destruction before it was repaired. It is said that when Zhangjiakou was first recovered, a ten-wheeled truck came from a nearby hole, and after traveling for dozens of days, only five of the ten wheels were left, and it continued to travel. At that time, the road was full of landmines and potholes everywhere, but now the road from the chief's office to the airfield is probably smoother than the section from Nanjing to Qixia Mountain and from Huxi to Hongqiao Road in Shanghai. This is something that we in the Beijing-Shanghai area should be ashamed of.

Chief Fu did this without collecting a single tax in Chahar Province and without conscripting a single soldier in Chahar Province. What is it for? In his own words, it is to "ensure that every ordinary person has food to eat." Achieving this goal is certainly not a matter of days, but this approach is always commendable.

The People Are His Strength

The hard work and struggle of General Fu and his staff in Chahar Province is something that people in Beijing and Shanghai cannot imagine. When the reporter was in Zhangjiakou, he asked him, "There are so many things to do in Chahar Province, how are the funds raised? I heard that your province is very short of talent. May I ask what plans you have for attracting and training talent?" Fu smiled wryly after hearing this, rubbed his hands together, and said in a deep voice: "There is no money at all for developing Chahar, not a single penny. We have already drafted a plan for attracting talent."

Yes, Chahar is incredibly poor (referring to above ground), but the provincial government's construction plans are still underway. What are they relying on as their backing? In another conversation, General Fu gave us the answer: He relies on the people. He told us in a storytelling tone how the workers in Zhangjiakou are now working hard and how they cherish their factories. He said: "The past destruction has increased the workers' work enthusiasm. The other side's behavior has strengthened the workers' love for the factory, because they did not know the value of the factory until there was no factory. The Zhangjiakou Broadcasting Station once had workers who sacrificed their lives to protect the machinery."

Fu told the reporter: The National Army was the first to be stationed in Zhangjiakou, and in this not-so-short period, there was not a single robbery in Zhangjiakou, and not even a few minor disputes occurred. This proves how much the people support the government.

Only a government that loves the people and cares for their welfare can truly get the help of the people. When reporting his thoughts on the Chongli incident, Fu finally mentioned, "Today, the Chinese people are in too much pain, and the common people are living inhuman lives. We should quickly help them solve their difficulties." This compassionate heart has already had an effect.

Zhangjiakou is not only the capital of Chahar, but also the border defense center of the country. The safety of the area affects not only the entire North China, but also the safety of the entire China. In addition to the natural barriers such as the Great Wall, there must be a new Great Wall built with the strength of the people guarding that important border town, and the strongest of these iron walls is General Fu Zuoyi, "every inch of whom has the temperament of the common people." —Recorded in the capital on January 4

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Sets Implementation Measures to Consolidate Tax Registers in the Pacification Zone, Severe Punishment for Fraud and Concealment

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang] The Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering that the counties in the province's Pacification Zone have been devastated and destroyed for a long time, and all the land tax registers have been scattered and lost, has specially formulated the Jiangsu Province Pacification Zone Tax Register Consolidation Implementation Measures to complete the consolidation within six months. The details of these measures are as follows: (1) The consolidation of tax registers in the Pacification Zone of this province, except for areas that retain land tax registers and are handled in accordance with the 35-year edition of the Jiangsu Province Sunan counties consolidation tax register measures, shall be handled in accordance with these measures. (2) The tax register consolidation business in the Pacification Zone of this province shall be supervised by the Land and Food Section or the Land Tax and Food Administration Office of each county (city) government, supervising the township and town chiefs, and no separate office shall be established. (3) Each county (city) government shall dispatch appropriate personnel to supervise different areas. (4) The procedures for tax register consolidation are as follows: one, on-site investigation; two, owner reporting; three, public announcement; four, ordering the old grain books to be checked; five, determining the grades and calculating the tax amount; six, compiling the tax register. (5) Tax register consolidation shall be based on townships and towns. Each township and town shall be divided into several sections according to the existing village boundaries and natural terrain. The township and town chiefs shall supervise the village chiefs to investigate the location of the land, mu, household name, address, user name, address, land price, income, grain amount, and other items, and list the land numbers starting and ending with the section. (6) After completing the investigation of each section of land, each village shall immediately notify the owners to submit deeds, grain strings, and certificates. The serial number shall be stamped or fingerprinted on the investigation form. A processing fee of 200 yuan shall be charged for each investigation form. (7) After completing the owner reporting procedures, the investigation forms shall be prepared in sections and listed at the offices of each village for public announcement. After a month, the township and town chiefs shall submit them to the county government. In case of disputes or conflicts during the public announcement period, they shall mediate or order them to go to court for legal processing. (8) The tax amount of each county (city) shall still be based on the total amount of land tax in each county (city). Counties (cities) with too many land grades may be appropriately merged into three grades and nine grades. (9) After the investigation forms of each township and town are collected, they shall be sorted and statistically analyzed. If there are excesses in the original total area or the original tax rate of each grade, they may be appropriately reduced. If there are deficiencies in the original total area or the original tax rate of each grade, they may be appropriately increased. A meeting of township and town chiefs shall be convened to decide and submit to the county assembly for review before submitting to the province for approval. (10) After the grade tax rate is determined, the investigation forms shall be compiled into household registers (household receipt registers) by household, using the township as the unit. After the tax register is compiled, the investigation forms shall be restored to their original state and bound into a book (village receipt household register). (11) Before consolidating the tax register, each county (city) shall convene village chiefs and local gentry groups to expand publicity so that the meaning of tax register consolidation is known to every household and the implementation is smooth. (12) Any personnel who violate the law or commit fraud in handling tax register consolidation in each county (city) shall be severely punished according to law. Any owner who conceals land without reporting it or who reports the area or grade incorrectly shall be severely punished.

### City Conditions in Hangzhou at the End of the Year Grow Increasingly Bleak, But It is Hoped That They Can Barely Weather the Difficulties

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 5th] As the Lunar New Year approaches, the decline of industry and commerce in Hangzhou is becoming increasingly severe. The purchasing power of the citizens is weak, and even the business of street vendors is sluggish, with daily sales of only over ten thousand yuan. The request for a 20 billion yuan loan for the end of the year, which was made by the business community to the Provincial Government, has not materialized. Most merchants are worried and distressed. However, according to financial figures, although Hangzhou's business community is quite strapped for cash at the end of the year, it is not expected to collapse as a result. Except for tea merchants, who have experienced many bankruptcies due to the impact on their business, most stores are still managing to barely weather the end of the year.

### Anhui Province Senator Request Strict Investigation of Corruption in Grain Purchasing

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Liu'an] Previously, there was corruption in the entrusted purchase of military grain in Sanhe in this county. After discussion, the County Council decided to send a letter to the County Government or the Judiciary Department to detain Cai Weiming, Pan Boyan, Cheng Yongshen, and other people involved in the corruption and recover the embezzled funds. However, many days have passed, and Cai Weiming and others are still at large. Now, County Councilors Shen Yaoting, Jiang Songya, Zhang Shouxian, and Chuan Yueqiao have jointly sent a letter to the County Council requesting a strict investigation. They pointed out that at the time of the entrusted purchase of grain in Sanhe, two jin of loss were added per hundred jin in advance, which was sufficient for wind erosion. However, Pan Boyan, Cheng Yongshen, and other warehouse keepers of the fourth and fifth warehouses arbitrarily borrowed and spent the grain, falsely claiming that the loss was as high as 240,000 jin, which was adding loss on top of loss. In addition, after investigating warehouses one, two, and three, there was still a surplus of over 10,000 jin of the same quality of rice delivered at the same time. Why was there such a surplus in one case and such a huge loss in another? The corruption is obvious. In addition, the section chief, Cai Zaming, privately sold over 76 shi of spoiled rice from the Sujiabu warehouse and the rice from Sanhe, and he also arbitrarily lent a lot of rice to private individuals and militias. All of this has been verified by the Entrusted Grain Purchase Liquidation Committee. It is also said that there are other unknown amounts that are difficult to ascertain for the time being.

Thoughts on Aviation Safety Inspired by the Plane Crash

Although the cause of this unprecedented aviation disaster was due to sudden changes in the weather, the pilot's skills and the equipment of the aircraft and airfield may also be factors contributing to the disaster. Assuming that all humanly possible things were perfected, it is not known whether this disaster could have been avoided.

After it has already happened, one can imagine how much consolation and compensation can actually benefit the victims and their families. The same is true for ships. The shipping industry should be deeply vigilant and not focus solely on profit-making while neglecting the seaworthiness of ships. If an unfortunate incident occurs, the loss of cargo can be easily recovered, but the loss of lives and the loss to the families of the victims can never be compensated by money. Moreover, the casualty rate of shipwrecks is greater than that of airplanes. Recalling the past, one shipwreck resulted in hundreds of lives lost. Thinking back on past events, one cannot help but shudder. Today's operators are only seeking to save costs when repairing ships and rushing the schedule, paying little attention to safety equipment. The competent authorities are also very lax in their inspections. All of these are factors that can lead to disasters. The most dangerous thing is the number of passengers exceeding the prescribed limit and the cargo exceeding the load line. As for the technical skills of the crew, as far as the current situation is concerned, senior personnel such as the captain and chief engineer have proven their performance since the victory and return to duty. However, second-level crew members have not fully met the standards, which is the most worrying thing at present. The crew members themselves should strive to improve, and companies with sufficient funds should spend it on training second-level personnel rather than training other personnel, and regarding the safety equipment of each ship, make as many additions as possible. Whether a ship is sailing or anchored, it cannot rely solely on the captain's superior technical experience. The responsibility of the second and third mates is also important. As for navigation safety equipment, our country is also a signatory to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and cannot ignore its responsibilities and obligations. Based on the above, what is expected of all parties can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) Shipping companies should not focus solely on profit-making and neglect all necessary equipment, such as compasses, sounding devices, anchor chains, wireless telegraphs, astronomical instruments, fire extinguishers, and life-saving equipment. They should all be fully equipped and usable, and any damage should be replaced immediately to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. (2) The competent authorities should be strict in inspecting ships and examining crew members, and must strictly prohibit passengers and cargo from exceeding the limit before departure, especially for small ships sailing in coastal waters. Special attention must be paid to this. It is all clearly stipulated in writing, but it depends on whether it can be enforced. (3) When troops board a ship, senior officers should pay attention to the number of people the ship can accommodate, and the location of loading and unloading military equipment and ammunition, as well as cooking on the ship, must be carefully selected. After boarding, the route and location of stops should be followed in accordance with the captain's instructions. (4) If passengers encounter a shipwreck, they should remain calm and follow the captain's instructions. They must not run around in a panic.

If all parties can cooperate and the crew strictly adhere to discipline, always focusing on "safety first" and being as cautious as walking on thin ice at all times, then disasters that can be avoided by human effort can be avoided, and even if they cannot be avoided, losses can be reduced. Conversely, what is called a natural disaster is actually man-made. Prevention should be taken before it happens. I dare to say a word to those involved in transportation. (Chen Tianjun)

Reply to Mr. Shen Wenjia of Jiaxing

Regarding the matter raised in your letter about the improper handling of a passenger injured by a gunshot wound by the Jiaxing station staff, after forwarding it to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration, we have now received a letter from the Transportation Department of the administration stating: "After a telegram was sent to the Jiaxing stationmaster for a reply, it was stated: 'On the afternoon of July 16th of this year, at around 4:00 PM, a passenger named Shao Wenhan was found sleeping on a rattan couch, accompanied by his family and Dr. Chen Jiaxuan of Fuyin Hospital, and brought to the station. It was said that he had accidentally injured his abdomen while playing with a handgun in the morning and intended to take the Xihu train to Shanghai for medical treatment. I observed at the time that the passenger's injury was very serious. According to the railway regulations, passengers with serious illnesses that may cause death or infectious diseases are not allowed to board the train. However, in order to save lives, I immediately agreed. However, according to the doctor, the injured passenger could not move or walk and had to be carried into the carriage along with the rattan couch. I kindly explained that the interior of the Xihu train was narrow and it would be difficult to place the rattan couch. The door was small, making it impossible to carry it in. It could only be changed to the next train, No. 62, and I would arrange for the rattan couch to be placed in the luggage car. The time would only be delayed by two hours. At the same time, I asked the doctor whether the injured passenger's condition would worsen due to the vibration of the train or whether there would be a risk of death along the way, and whether the doctor would escort him to Shanghai to provide emergency treatment? The doctor replied: It is difficult to predict at this time, and I am unable to escort him due to important matters and he will be accompanied by family. Seeing that the doctor was unwilling to take responsibility, and because I am ignorant of medicine, if the passenger died along the way, who would be responsible? Therefore, I immediately telegraphed Dr. Xue Zhaoji and Dr. Tang Renjing of the Jiaxing Clinic to come to the station for diagnosis. According to the opinion of the two doctors, the bullet hit the abdomen and did not penetrate. The injury was not minor, and it was difficult to determine whether there would be any danger along the way after two or three hours of train vibration. Therefore, the family consulted with Dr. Chen and decided to discontinue the trip to Shanghai and instead send him to the Jiaxing Zhejiang Provincial Hospital for treatment. Based on the above facts, the failure to board the Xihu train was actually limited by the fact that the passenger could not move and had to be carried in with the rattan couch. As for the Xihu train not being able to accommodate the huge rattan couch and the door not being able to carry it in, these are definite facts. I did not refuse him and agreed to let him take train No. 62 to Shanghai, which can also be said to have fulfilled my duty to assist. The passenger came to the station accompanied by Dr. Chen, and Dr. Xue and Dr. Tang were only a stone's throw away from the station. How can it be said that there was a deliberate attempt to make things difficult by repeatedly requesting proof? Since he was determined to go to Shanghai for medical treatment, he could have changed to train No. 62. The temporary decision to send him to the Provincial Hospital proves that his injury was dangerous and he voluntarily gave up his claim to take the train. What does this have to do with my station? As for the assertion that sending him to Shanghai would definitely save him, while staying in Jiaxing would definitely lead to death, the doctor was unable to guarantee it at the time. It is even more absurd to accuse others with unsubstantiated claims. Moreover, this matter has been over five months ago. If I had acted improperly or deliberately made things difficult at the time, the family could have filed a complaint earlier. Why wait until today to make a pointless submission? This shows that someone else has fabricated facts and deliberately defamed me. In short, this matter has been certified by the two doctors, Xue and Tang, and the true cause of death can be verified by the Provincial Hospital. Empty words cannot be used to convict people.' After reviewing the statement, there is nothing inconsistent. Please examine and act accordingly." Respectfully submitted.

According to reporters, Bilbo and leaders of both the Republican and Democratic parties have welcomed a compromise solution in which Bilbo will receive pay but not be sworn in or take office pending the outcome of the investigation. Bilbo was elected as a third-term senator last year and is being investigated for allegedly preventing black people from voting and using his position to seek personal gain in wartime construction projects. This compromise solution will allow the other thirty-five senators to be sworn in, and the Republican Party can officially take control of the Senate. President Truman will also be able to deliver his address to a joint session of Congress next Monday as planned.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] The focus of the first post-war meeting of the U.S. Congress will be on domestic issues rather than international affairs. Important issues to be discussed include immigration restrictions, a 20% tax cut, election procedures, preventing the growth of labor power, and increasing veterans' rights.

American Liberal Representatives Form New Political Organization

[United Press, Washington, 4th] One hundred and fifty representatives of American "liberals" tonight initiated the formation of the "Democratic Action Alliance." It was announced that Communists and their colleagues are not allowed to join. The organization's purpose is to follow the teachings of great democratic figures such as Washington, Lincoln, Wilson, and Roosevelt and uphold six basic principles. Franklin Roosevelt Jr., former Price Administrator Henderson, radio commentator Davis, and United Auto Workers President Luther have been designated as organizers to form an organizing committee. This new political group is sponsored by the original "Democratic Action Union," which invited representatives to attend the meeting, which led to the decision to form the new association. Its founding declaration states, "We do not associate with the American Communist Party or quasi-Communist parties, just as we do not associate with Fascists or quasi-Fascists, in exactly the same way." This declaration is significant because on December 30th, the "American Progressive Citizens Association" was formed in New York, welcoming all those who embrace liberalism, regardless of race, religion, skin color, original nationality, or political affiliation. This new association has set up its own banner, competing for leadership among American liberals. The American Progressive Citizens Association is a merger of the "National Citizens Political Action Committee" and nine other groups. Former Commerce Secretary Wallace is also a founder.

### Completion of Draft Atomic Control Plan; Baruch Submits Resignation; Truman Accepts and Praises His Achievements; Austin to be Responsible for Future Work

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Correspondent in New York, 5th] Bernard Baruch, the United States representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, recently submitted his resignation to President Truman, stating that his task of drafting an international atomic energy control plan had been completed.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Truman's reply to Baruch's resignation stated: Henceforth, the U.S. representative to the UN Atomic Energy Commission should focus on Austin, the representative to the Security Council. This move is in accordance with Baruch's recommendation.

[Central News Agency, London, 4th, United Press] Montgomery has led his entourage to Moscow. While passing through Berlin, he will meet with Lieutenant General Robertson, the Chief of Staff of the British occupation forces in Germany. He said: He will stay in Moscow for a week, residing in the British Embassy in Moscow. He hopes that this trip will allow him to meet again with the Soviet generals he had met during the war. He has no plans to travel within the Soviet Union. He said, this needs to be decided by the Soviet army, because I am going to the Soviet Union as a soldier, and I want to respect the Soviet army. They are a great army and have made great contributions to the victory of the Allies. I want to establish friendly relations with the Soviet army. For our common benefit, I sincerely hope that this friendly relationship can achieve mutual understanding and trust.

### Four Foreign Ministers' Trieste Resolution Submitted to Security Council for Approval

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] The decision made by the four foreign ministers regarding the Trieste issue, after much hard work, has been submitted to the United Nations Security Council for final decision. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, in his capacity as chairman of the foreign ministers' conference, sent a letter to the Security Council on this matter, attaching a document on the Trieste issue divided into seven parts. In his letter, he requested the Security Council to make a decision on this matter before January 15, so as to finalize the Italian peace treaty scheduled to be signed in early February. According to the provisions of the Italian peace treaty, Trieste is a free port area, and its independence is guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council. As such, the provisions and clauses regarding Trieste must be submitted to the Security Council for acceptance before the entire Italian peace treaty is signed. Most observers believe that the Security Council will likely approve the decision made by the four foreign ministers on the Trieste issue.

[United Press, New York, 4th] The new director of the United Nations Security Council, Syria, insisted today that the Security Council should first seek the collective security of all countries in the world, and then carry out universal disarmament. The Soviet Union had requested the Security Council to implement the United Nations General Assembly's disarmament plan within 90 days. Syrian representative Curry said today that treaties and agreements should first be concluded between countries and United Nations agencies to ensure their security. The Security Council should first obtain reports on the number of troops in all member states, and then formulate measures to supply the United Nations agencies with forces to ensure peace and security. It is also inappropriate to carry out disarmament before the peace treaties are signed. The issue of atomic energy control should be given priority consideration.

### Soviet Embassy in the United States Wants to Arrest Embezzling Staff

Has Requested Extradition from the U.S. Department of State

[United Press, Washington, 4th] The Soviet Embassy today submitted a note to the State Department, stating: A Soviet citizen named Alekseev, formerly stationed in Mexico as a staff member of the trade delegation, deserted his post and resided in the United States, and made speeches denouncing the Soviet Union as a "dictatorial hell."

### Britain Plans to Maintain Military Strategic Position in the Middle East; Decides to Deal with the Situation in Palestine with Force; King of Transjordan to Visit Turkey

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] Observers here recently stated that the London Palestine Round Table Conference will resume on the 21st of this month. The general public in Britain believes that maintaining Britain's military base in the Middle East and building an oil pipeline from Mesopotamia to Haifa is as important as protecting the interests of Arabs or Jews. This view will have an impact on the discussions at the Palestine Conference. For this reason, Britain does not attach importance to deciding to establish a single country in Palestine, ruled by the Arab government, or to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. What it pays attention to is to find ways to maintain Britain's military and economic position in the Middle East.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 5th Radio: Field Marshal Montgomery has drafted a plan to use violence to deal with the riots of Jews in the Holy Land.

[Reuters, London, 5th] The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent solemnly pointed out that when High Commissioner for Palestine Cunningham discussed the Palestine issue with British Colonial Secretary Jones yesterday, British Chief of the Imperial General Staff Field Marshal Montgomery also participated, indicating that the government plans to use military measures to deal with the situation in Palestine, where a full state of emergency may be declared. At the same time, existing control and security measures will be tightened. If so, in addition to dealing with the riots of Jewish terrorists with government power, extraordinary military force can also be used to stop them.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 5th] The Port of Haifa implemented special precautions today after the Turkish President Inonu's ship arrived. The ship came to prepare for the King of Transjordan, Abdullah, to take a visit to Turkey. Abdullah is scheduled to arrive in Haifa on Monday.

It seems that the Arabs are willing to cooperate with Western countries rather than embrace the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The entire city of Paris was in an uproar today over the case of father raping daughter and mother raping son. When the police went to 35 Peace Street to arrest Maurice Magran, they saw him in his daughter Nanette's room. Maurice was only wearing a bathrobe, and Nanette was unwilling to answer any questions, but she did not admit that her father had committed any violent acts.

### The Moscow Conference Approaches: The Ins and Outs of the German Question

The Soviet-occupied zone of Germany is nearing industrial collapse, a situation so dire that the Soviet Union must make a major decision on the German question before this winter. Will it support the Anglo-American plan to unify Germany, or will it disregard all sacrifices and implement the Sovietization of eastern Germany?

The Soviet Union Moves German Industry

Most of the heavy industrial equipment in the Soviet zone has already been moved to the Soviet Union. The remaining industry is insufficient to produce daily necessities for the general public. Severe shortages of essential raw materials such as coal and steel are forcing many factories in eastern Germany to shut down. If the economy of the Soviet zone collapses, all the Soviet Union's efforts to win the friendship of the German people will suffer a severe blow.

The Soviet Union not only transported much factory equipment to the Soviet Union as reparations but also took away the products of the remaining factories under the same pretext. Almost all the products of the Zeiss Ikon optical instrument factory are shipped to the Soviet Union, and almost all textiles are allocated to the Soviet Union. The lack of raw materials is causing these factories' production to decline daily.

Severe Shortage of Raw Materials in the Soviet Zone

The fundamental reason for the Soviet Union's lack of materials is that Germany is currently divided into four occupation zones, preventing economic integration. Most of the Soviet zone's industry relies on coal and steel from the Ruhr region, which is now under British control. The Soviet side urgently needs coal from the Ruhr region and has agreed to divide all German coal into four shares, but insists that the design work for coal production must also be jointly decided by the four countries. The British authorities insist that the Soviet Union must first agree to place all German industry under unified management; otherwise, the Soviet Union's proposal cannot be implemented.

Therefore, the Soviet Union has only two options: either find coal and steel from elsewhere, such as Poland, or transport coal and steel from its own country to Germany. If it takes this step, it will place an extremely heavy burden on the entire Soviet economic system.

The future economic fate of eastern Germany depends on the outcome of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.

The United Kingdom and the United States Oppose Soviet Measures

The United Kingdom and the United States oppose the Soviet Union's transfer of industrial products from the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany to the Soviet Union, arguing that the reparations stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement are limited to the equipment of factories that participated in the war effort, and that the products of general factories after the war are not included in this scope. The export of these products should be used to pay for necessary imports and occupation costs. The United Kingdom and the United States spend millions of dollars annually to import necessary goods to Germany for the people in the British and American zones. If there are surplus goods in the Soviet zone that can be exported, they should be jointly managed by the four countries to reduce the economic burden on each country.

However, the Soviet side argues that the United Kingdom and the United States have handed over very few industrial equipment that should have been dismantled from western Germany and transported to the Soviet Union according to the agreement, and that the work is progressing very slowly. Therefore, the British side has no responsibility to hand over the products of the Soviet zone. In addition, the Soviet Union insists that political unification must precede economic unification. The differences in opinion between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the German question are roughly as follows.

Furthermore, France's position is also an obstacle to the overall unification of Germany. It believes that the western borders of Germany must be determined before participating in discussions on unification. France demands that the Saar region be annexed and that the Ruhr region be separated from Germany to ensure that Germany does not rise again and engage in wars of aggression. France must wait until the security of its eastern border is guaranteed before considering the next step; otherwise, it will oppose discussing the unification of Germany.

The United Kingdom and the United States had wanted to consult with the Soviet Union and exclude the French zone of Germany, and first hold negotiations on the merger of the British, American, and Soviet zones, but this also failed, resulting in the Soviet Union adopting a unilateral policy in eastern Germany.

Industry in the Soviet Zone is Divided into Three Categories

The Soviet authorities have now divided the industry in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany into three categories for separate management. One part is managed by the German local government and supervised by the Soviet military headquarters. These factories include those formerly owned by Nazi elements and those that had served the German war machine and employed prisoners of war. Another part of the factories is dedicated to manufacturing equipment for the Soviet army. Factories that manufacture special weapons, such as rockets, are also managed by the Soviet military. However, the production of military equipment in the Soviet zone is not very large. On the contrary, the Soviet Union's domestic military production has continued to increase.

Another part of the factories is managed by the Central Soviet Industrial Association. Most of the important industries are within its management scope. Many military factories currently managed by the Soviet military will eventually be handed over to the Industrial Association. These factories are considered reparations, and the reason they remain in Germany is simply to utilize the skilled personnel that the Soviet Union lacks. These include textile factories, chemical factories, machine factories, fuel factories, and public utilities.

The Soviet Union Must Make a Final Choice

Whether these factories will continue to remain in Germany to Sovietize eastern Germany, or be transported to the Soviet Union as reparations, or be used as bargaining chips in discussions on the German unification issue, is still undecided. Only Moscow can make this decision. However, in view of the upcoming meeting of the four foreign ministers in Moscow this spring, and the increasingly serious economic situation in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the Soviet Union should make a final choice in the near future. (Translated by Ya Nong from "World Report Weekly")

The Soviet Union uses German industrial equipment to manufacture various precision instruments. The illustration shows the Zeiss Ikon optical instrument factory manufacturing a large telescope for the Leningrad Observatory.

### Persevering in the Industrial Struggle: A New Year's Visit to Wu Yun Chu: Talking Freely About the Feelings of Industrial Recovery in the Past Year: Reviewing the Situation of Industrial Zones Throughout the Country

[Special Feature by This Newspaper] China's current unstable economic situation is not suitable for running industries, but "even in the darkest storm, the rooster crows incessantly." Industrialists are still fighting tirelessly, and Wu Yun Chu is undoubtedly one of the representatives among these fighters. Yesterday, the reporter visited this gray-haired and approachable veteran industrialist to express New Year's greetings and ask him about his feelings on industrial recovery in the past year. He said that he did not have the figures at hand to give an accurate answer to this question, but his Tianchu factory had only recovered a quarter of its capacity under the efforts of all. Tianyuan in West Shanghai has not yet started construction, and the Tianli factory's resumption of work is uncertain due to a lack of electricity. During the war, he had the ambition to set up a factory in Xinjiang and had made considerable preparations, but the province was then under the rule of Sheng Shicai, and the Lin Lingyong case caused them to have safety concerns. Although there were personnel changes in the provincial government later, the Yining Incident, which had a background, made the situation in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains even more turbulent, and the large-scale textile factory establishment plan originally scheduled to be implemented by the Xinjiang Provincial Government was also shelved. Private factories were even more out of the question. "The difficulties that my factory has encountered are the same as those that other industries in China are experiencing."

External Pressure is No Exception

He pointed out that the speed of our industrial recovery is being restricted by various unfavorable factors at home and abroad. In addition to the general situation, high prices and excessive expenses are the biggest reasons. Wu said with a smile: Although bleaching powder has no sales, the cost of building two bleaching powder towers is 400 million yuan. In addition, imported goods put great pressure on domestic industries, and the chemical industry is no exception. For example, a bucket of American bleaching powder sells for 9 Hong Kong dollars, but the cost of domestic goods is more than doubled. In this situation, the tragic event of dumping bleaching powder into the sea has been created! Reviewing the situation of industrial zones throughout the country, he said that the large-scale industries in the Northeast are very concentrated, but because the military operations have not ended and the order is unstable, the recovery work has not yet begun. Taiwan has cheap electricity and other superior conditions, and the recovery work has begun, but no Taiwanese goods have been found on the market. The reporter asked him about the prospects for industry this year. He said that if the general situation is not optimistic, it is difficult to have great hope.

Japanese Industry is Still Difficult to Fully Recover

The conversation naturally turned from the issue of domestic industrial recovery to the recovery of Japanese industry. Wu's attitude was very calm, and he did not exaggerate the crisis in any way. His observation is that a large-scale chemical industry in Japan is related to military affairs, and these cannot be fully restored this year. However, the industry that used to manufacture nitric acid will now fulfill fertilizer, which is what the United States hopes Japan will use to improve people's lives. Among the industrial reparations from Japan to China, there are very few chemical materials, and most of them belong to liquid fuels. However, how to digest and utilize these reparations materials is a big problem for us. The freight for one ton is at least 1 million legal currency, and a large-scale factory has at least 1,000 tons of materials; the number is very considerable. In addition to the necessary working capital and construction costs, the general private industry cannot bear it. These many practical considerations in the past made private industries not very enthusiastic about reporting losses, so the loss report submitted to the United States by Ambassador Gu Weijun for the first time was particularly small. Now our loss statistics are more complete, but the United States' attitude towards Japan has been very friendly.

Eliminating the Crisis Should Be Jointly Responsible

When talking about the government's industrial policy, Wu said that the government is quite able to accept the opinions of the private sector, but there are too many factors in this crisis. The current production loans are of great help to the industrial sector, but he hopes that they will be handled fairly. The import license system is also a way to protect national industry, and the problem lies in implementation. He believes that in many places, the responsibility should be borne by all parties. For example, the last revision of the exchange rate, the government's decision was correct. At that time, the municipal government convened representatives of the city's industrial and commercial circles and asked them to help stabilize prices in order to avoid affecting social order. However, after the fact, those who did not import raised prices, and those who had imported also raised prices. In this event, to be fair, the responsibility lies with all parties.

Comparison of Efficiency Between State-Owned and Private Enterprises

The reporter asked Wu for his opinion on the Ministry of Economic Affairs' change in the asset valuation method. He said that this is a reasonable measure, and it was proposed at the Chongqing production meeting in the past. In terms of the increase in multiples, it is also close to the actual situation, but the general industry may not be able to bear the 20% cash capital increase. At the same time, under this method, it is equivalent to the official admitting that industry has no money to be made, and the profits tax will become a problem in the future. Regarding the disposal of enemy and puppet factories, the veteran industrialist also expressed many wonderful opinions. To sum up his words: the valuation of enemy and puppet factories was in the spring of last year, and the sale was in the autumn and winter. Prices are changing with each passing day, but the valuation remains unchanged. Therefore, industrialists who take over, if they can make good use of them, will not be a losing deal. As for the big question of state-owned and private enterprises, his views are different from those of general private industrialists. He said: In a capitalist society, due to the stimulation of selfish motives, the efficiency of private enterprises is relatively high, and the efficiency of state-owned enterprises is undeniably relatively low, but the trend of the world is towards socialization! I agree that whether state-owned or private, they should be corporatized, and stocks can be traded publicly on the market. Today it is state-owned, and tomorrow it can become private. In this way, the dispute between state-owned and private enterprises will be resolved without solving it!

Donations Used for Scientific Research

At the beginning of the victory, Wu announced that he would donate the stocks he held as a fund for chemical research and organize a management committee to manage and use it. The reporter asked him how much this fund was? How is it planned to be used? His answer was: He holds 40% of the stocks of Tianchu and Tianyuan factories, which are worth about 10 billion yuan at the time. At present, the factories have resumed work, and the fund has already received income. As for the use of the fund, a consultant group has already drafted a plan in the past. After the management committee starts working in the future, all plans will be implemented gradually. It is common for a successful industrialist to donate huge sums of money for scientific research in foreign countries. It is a pioneering undertaking in our country. We hope that he can be a successful pioneer in this regard!

### A Large Number of Begging Monks Discovered in Liuhang Town

On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, in Liuhang Town, which belongs to the county, a large number of begging monks were suddenly discovered, numbering about 30 people, mixed in the town. The authorities, because of their large number and secretive behavior, detained them all for investigation.

### Yan Huizhu's Old Case is Brought Up Again: General Liu is Detained and Brought to Shanghai

[Reported from Beiping on the 5th by This Newspaper] According to local reports, at the beginning of the victory two years ago, General Liu, who came to Ping with the army, had a romantic affair with Kunqu opera actress Yan Huizhu (the actress committed suicide because of this). After the matter was revealed, he left Ping and was transferred to another position, and later obtained a chance to go to the United States to work. Recently, the highest authorities ordered the competent authorities to transfer Liu back to the country for investigation. Xun happened to be setting off to return to the country and was captured by a US plane in San Francisco and escorted back to Shanghai, where he is now being detained in a certain military institution. At the beginning of the case, because "Liu" and "Lu" have the same sound, it was once mistakenly reported as Lu Wenzhen, the director of the forward command post of the 11th War Zone in Beiping, and spread for a while.

### Cross-River Project Issues: Final Decision to Be Made, Majority Favor Tunnel Construction, Estimated Cost 76 Billion, Location at Bund of Zhongzheng East Road

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the city's cross-river project, in June of last year, the Shanghai Cross-River Engineering Committee entrusted the China Bridge Company to handle the design and drilling work, stipulating that it be carried out in two phases. The first phase of work included selecting and surveying the site, compiling a report on the research results, and submitting it to the Cross-River Engineering Committee for study and decision on the location and type of project. The second phase of work included drilling the geological conditions of the Pujiang River at the selected site, designing engineering drawings, preparing engineering budgets, drafting engineering plans, and preparing bidding and contracting procedures. The China Bridge Company received design funding in August of last year and began the first phase of work. After research, four types of cross-river engineering methods were proposed: (1) Constructing a tunnel under the Huangpu River. (2) Constructing a high-level fixed bridge that allows tall-masted ships to pass underneath. (3) Constructing a low-level movable bridge that opens and closes at designated times for ships to pass. (4) Constructing a fixed bridge upstream of the Pujiang River, allowing only medium-sized ships to pass, with tall-masted ships limited to mooring downstream of the bridge location.

After Director Zhao Zukang of the Municipal Public Works Bureau convened the second technical advisory committee meeting for the cross-river project last week, advisors Yuan, Zheng Hua, Zhu Guoxi, Huang Yan, Chen Yimin, Kang Lituo, and others discussed and concluded that the tunnel and low-level movable bridge options were more suitable and less expensive to construct. According to estimates by the China Bridge Company, constructing a tunnel would require approximately 76 billion yuan, while a bridge would require 41.2 billion yuan.

Two Locations Determined

Regarding the conditions for selecting a site for the cross-river project, the following was decided: (1) It cannot be too far from the city center to avoid circuitous roads, affecting the time and expenses of most passengers. (2) The roads connecting the approach bridges must be able to accommodate cross-river vehicles in addition to the original transportation volume. (3) The location of the approach bridges or walkways must not interfere with nearby or perpendicular existing transportation systems. (4) During construction, damage to existing buildings should be minimized. (5) After completion, the approach bridges should not block the light of buildings on both sides or obstruct the access of residents on both sides. (6) The tunnel exit must not be affected by tidal backflow from the river. (7) Obstruction to water traffic during and after construction must be minimal.

Furthermore, the preliminary discussions determined the following construction locations for the cross-river project: (1) Reserve the Bund of Zhongzheng East Road as the location for building a tunnel. (2) Assume that the Shiliupu area is the location for building a movable bridge.

Tunnel Saves Time

Yesterday afternoon, a reporter specifically visited Zhu Guoxi, director of the engineering structure department of the Public Works Bureau, to inquire about the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of bridges and tunnels. According to Zhu, the majority opinion of the technical advisory committee leans towards building a tunnel. Although the construction of a tunnel is more costly, its benefits to transportation are greater. For the sake of a permanent solution, traffic regulation must rely on a tunnel. After the construction of a movable bridge, the passage of vehicles and ships would be limited by time, while a tunnel would save time and have no slope resistance. The technical advisory committee has made a detailed comparison of bridges and tunnels, and a final decision is expected at the third meeting convened by the Public Works Bureau on the 15th of this month.

No Problem with Funding

Regarding the funding for the cross-river project, it is rumored that the land appreciation tax method will be adopted. After the completion of the cross-river project, the land within approximately one kilometer around the project will directly benefit, and the land price will inevitably increase. Either the original landowners will pay the increased value, or the government will purchase the land at the original price and resell it at the increased value. If the increase is calculated tenfold, then there will be no concern about the funding for the project. Once the cross-river project is decided, it is rumored that the Bank of China and others are willing to invest. Therefore, there is no problem with funding.

According to estimates by hydraulic experts, the construction of the cross-river project will take approximately one year.

### Police Officer Shooting Case: "Little Pockface" Arrested, Confesses to Several Cases

(Report from This Newspaper) Xu Jia Hui Police Precinct Chief and Deputy Chief Bo Dexin, Xu Guoliang, based on confidential reports stating that the fierce bandit known as "Little Pockface" was the main perpetrator in the shooting and wounding of Police Officer Bao Changtao, badge number 815, of the Jing'an Temple Precinct at the intersection of Zhongzheng West Road and Fumin Road on the morning of the 24th of last month, and was currently hiding in Fahuazhen. Upon receiving the report, Chief Bo immediately ordered Section Chief Yong Shao of the Second Section, along with Section Members Sun Shanggeng, plainclothes officers Ma Shifan, Yin Mengfei, Zhao Chunpu, Zhang Shouzheng, and others, to disguise themselves and rush to the area to wait at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday. Soon after, they saw "Little Pockface" arrive, and the officers bravely rushed forward and grabbed him. They found a box cannon and eight bullets, all loaded, on the bandit's person. He was then taken back to the precinct for strict interrogation. He confessed that his name was Wang Yourong, 31 years old, from Taizhou, and directly admitted to shooting and wounding Police Officer Bao Changtao. He also confessed to committing several theft cases, including at the homes of the Fang family at No. 330, Xin Yi Li, Datong Road, and Zhu Genfu at No. 110, Shanhaiguan Road, stealing gold jewelry and legal tender, which he divided and spent with his accomplices.

### US Military Humiliation of Female Student: Jiaotong University and Shanghai University Professors Issue Written Opinions, Demanding Prompt Handling to Prevent Recurrence

Professors Liu Dajie, Gao Junshan, Zhang Yaoxiang, Shen Youqian, Yu Qingtang, Wang Guoxiu, Liu Xian, Qian Zhongshu, Sun Guiding, Chen Xuanxian, Wang Chengzhu, Yu Nanqiu, Chen Kemei, Huang Jiade, Hu Zuyin, Zuo Renxia, Jiang Zaihua, and Huang Jiayin from Jiaotong University and St. John's University in the city issued written opinions on the case of the rape of a Peking University female student by a US soldier, stating that this incident of a US soldier raping a Chinese female student in Peking is an unforgivable atrocity. All Chinese people express their grief, anger, and protest against this indecent act. We express our gratitude for the assistance and sympathy that the US military gave to China during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but the actions of this type of US soldier will undoubtedly cause the Chinese people to lose their goodwill towards the United States. This is undoubtedly a serious loss to the spirit of cooperation between the Chinese and American people. We demand that the government lodge a serious protest with the responsible US authorities, publicize the truth of the facts in the near future, severely punish the perpetrators, compensate for the losses, publicly apologize, and, more importantly, that the government take the most effective measures to prevent the recurrence of this type of atrocity. At the same time, we demand that the US military authorities, in this atmosphere of intense anger, handle this case with the fairest attitude and the quickest methods, and also find ways to restore the sympathy of the Chinese people for the US military that has been lost this time.

### United Anti-Riot Federation Issues Letter to All Sectors

The "Shanghai University Student United Anti-Riot Federation," organized by students from various universities in the city, issued a letter to fellow compatriots from all sectors yesterday to oppose a small number of students who, under the guise of protesting against the atrocities of the US military, attempted to incite strikes, market closures, and work stoppages to disrupt social order. The original text is as follows: "Fellow compatriots, we are deeply angered by the unfortunate incident in Peiping, in which Mr. Shen was humiliated. As this incident spread throughout the country, universities and colleges in various places have already issued just appeals and condolences, and have held a one-day strike to show their protest and demand that the perpetrators be severely punished, that damages be compensated, and that guarantees be given that similar incidents will not occur again in the future. The US military authorities have now fully accepted. This matter should be urged by the government, and we look forward to a satisfactory outcome. As matters have developed to this point, they could have come to an end, but a small number of conspirators and unscrupulous individuals in our city want to use this unfortunate incident to expand their distorted propaganda and use it as a tool for an anti-American movement, attempting to incite people from all walks of life to incite strikes, market closures, and work stoppages to disrupt the peace and tranquility of society. In view of this, our association has exposed its conspiracy and advised people from all walks of life not to be used by unscrupulous elements. The fact that a US soldier in Peiping insulted a female student is purely a legal matter and should not be confused with a political matter. The fault of one US soldier should not represent the actions of the entire US military. The relationship between China and the United States has always been very close, and the friendship between China and the United States cannot be lost due to the fault of one US soldier. Now that the US military authorities have fully accepted the demands we have made, how can we have any more harsh conditions? We hope that people from all walks of life will remain calm, recognize the facts, and not be incited by conspirators and follow blindly. Our slogans are: (1) Oppose the use of students by various parties as sacrifices in political struggles. (2) All parties should immediately withdraw from schools. (3) Request the government to promptly punish the perpetrators. (4) Overthrow the rioters who incite "strikes," "work stoppages," and "market closures" to disrupt social order. (5) Please do not only consider the interests of the party and put the nation and the country to death. (6) The atrocities of the US military should be resolved through legal and diplomatic means.

### Daughter-in-Law's Business Is Slow, Old Woman Ends Life by Hanging

The old woman Wang Shen of Haining, who is seventy-two years old this year, only gave birth to a daughter, who married the peddler Lin Xiaofang as his wife. Shen lived with her son-in-law, residing at No. 216 Shunchang Road. Recently, her son-in-law's business has been slow, and he has been living in sorrow all day. Therefore, Shen suddenly had the thought of ending her life. At 6:00 AM yesterday, taking advantage of the fact that no one was paying attention, she hanged herself in her room. Her son-in-law discovered her, but it was too late to save her. The police station then carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang to await inspection.

Dong Wenli (aka Dong Xiaokai), the king of used goods, who lives at No. 194 Jinan Road (aka Rue Piquet), has operated the Yuanyuan Rosewood Furniture Store for many years and has considerable assets, but he has a long-standing addiction to opium that he has not been able to quit. Recently, the police station received a confidential report indicating that Dong was suspected of drug trafficking. Therefore, Zhang Rou, the judicial section chief of the Taishan Precinct, led police officers Wu Youkai and Zhang Dazhen to rush to the location the day before yesterday morning, arrest Dong, and seize a pipe for opium dregs, seven opium bubbles, and other drug paraphernalia. He was taken to the police station to await questioning.

### War of Resistance Literature Exhibition: A Sobering Review

[Special Article from Our Newspaper] The eight-year arduous War of Resistance Against Japan ended just over a year ago, but the past hatred, trauma, and humiliation seem to have been submerged by the heavy burden of life. The opening of the War of Resistance Literature Exhibition reopens old wounds and gives us a sobering review.

In this exhibition, one can see three opposing forces during the War of Resistance: a force of justice, a force of invaders, and a force of collaborators who acted as accomplices to the tigers.

Initially, the first force suffered considerable and cruel blows. In the light and shadow of the gunfire, one sees the entire suffering of Shanghai: the great fire in Zhabei, Fudan University in the rubble, Luodian, which was lost and regained in a seesaw battle, and the most important work in the atmosphere of ammunition, rescue, and burial. These all have a tragic tone. Secondly, we saw the retreat from Songhu, the siege of the Four Lines Warehouse, the underground workers struggling in the enemy's iron net, and the tortures of the enemy and "76." Here, there is the terrifying face of Liu Zhigang after being injected with poison, Jiang Menglin's severed right ear after being injured, and the corpses and bloodstains of countless unyielding people... But slowly, this atmosphere of terror finally dissipated in the sunlight of victory. Colorful pictorials, nationwide celebrations, and the solemn proclamations of the military police and garrison headquarters ended the eight-year course of the War of Resistance in another atmosphere of joy.

To understand the means by which the enemy invaded our country, one must pay attention to the activities of traitors who betrayed the motherland. In the many photos displayed in the corridor, we see a kind of terrifying silence, a kind of anesthetized revelry. The enemy and puppet's duplicitous slogans are ironclad evidence of hypocritical friendship and enslavement propaganda. We see the banquets of the enemy and puppet ringleaders, the so-called Greater East Asia Literary Representative Conference, and the exhibition of works by artists who collaborated with the enemy. We also see the enemy and puppet's collection of metals and forced purchase of cotton cloth, as well as a dramatic gambling den. This fully demonstrates the ugly state of friction and contradiction between the enemy and the collaborators.

Most of the items displayed in the second exhibition room are the inferior deeds left by the enemy and puppets during the War of Resistance. Wang Jingwei's declaration of war and the dregs of the chaotic economy in the occupied areas, such as military tickets, Chinese bonds, small change tickets printed by stores, etc. In addition, there are Japanese ancient religious rituals, ancient armor statues, etc., which give us a kind of understanding of the traditional temperament of the Japanese nation. At the same time, it also reveals that although Japan has failed, we cannot ignore Japan's suppressed aggressive ambitions.

### Book Industry Petition Representatives Go to Beijing Again Today, Counterparts from All Regions Respond One After Another

The book industry, in order to request exemption from business tax, has repeatedly convened emergency meetings and decided to go to Beijing again to petition. It is reported that the delegation of Li Bojia, Zheng Nongshan, Lu Baozhong, Zhou Xihe, Xu Boxin, Liu Jikang, Yao Pengzi, Wang Mengzou, Jiang Zhenzhan, and others, a group of twenty people, will go to Beijing today to submit petitions directly to the relevant agencies, such as the Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, to strive for the complete exemption of business tax and to demand that cultural undertakings be given emergency and effective relief. It is also heard that since the book industry association telegraphed its counterparts throughout the country, hoping to strive together, it has successively received responses from the trade associations in Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Bengbu, Kaifeng, Chongqing, Liyang, Qingdao, Huaining (Anqing), Jiangdu, Nanchang, Jingxian (Anhui) and other places, all of whom insisted on the complete exemption of business tax, otherwise they would not hesitate to make any sacrifices and would be willing to serve as a backing.

### Gao Sheng Bargain Sale of Goods: Harmonious Relationship Between Labor and Management

Gao Sheng, a paper store in this city, suffered heavy losses due to the mob's destruction of the peddler case twice before, and is still unable to continue operating. All the employees, mostly old workers with decades of experience, have a harmonious relationship with the capital side on weekdays, so even though the store has been closed for a long time, they all hold the purpose of sharing weal and woe and are unwilling to leave. The store owner recently decided to sell the remaining ledgers, paper, etc. at a low price from today to maintain the lives of the workers, so that the proceeds can be used to help both labor and capital through the difficult years, as the end of the year is approaching.

### Lawyer Wu Lvpíng Reports That His Wife Is Using Drugs

Lawyer Wu Lvping, who lives at No. 6, Alley 4, Linsen East Road, reported to the judicial section of the Taishan Precinct yesterday morning that he and Zhang Sufen, a woman from Wuxi, (37 years old), have lived together for 20 years. Their relationship was very close, and they had three sons and three daughters. Unexpectedly, in recent years, it was discovered that Zhang Sufen had an opium habit. She often sneaks to Yanziwo in Jiumu, to smoke opium, but because her whereabouts are secretive, the location of the Yanziwo cannot be found. Recently, she has not regretted her actions and has even pawned almost all the clothes and jewelry in her home. After I discovered and condemned her, she even retorted. Therefore, I had no choice but to report the case and request that the case be summoned and investigated according to the law. Section Chief Zhang, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered officers to summon Zhang Sufen for interrogation. According to Zhang, she admitted that she had smoked it before because she was ill after giving birth, but now she had already quit and broken her addiction. The reason for the report was that her husband had an affair and refused to give her living expenses. Therefore, he reported the case. Section Chief Zhang then said that whether or not Zhang had drugs could not be trusted, pending a transfer to the hospital for testing, before the verification would be handled.

### Random Thoughts on Local Drama

— Special Article from Our Newspaper

Chinese opera, like language, varies from place to place. The so-called southern tunes and northern melodies, Yue tunes and Thai tunes, are mostly based on place names. That is, the Kun opera, which was once popular, and the Peking opera, which is popular today, have both evolved from local operas. The scripts of local operas are a kind of popular literature, derived from the mountain songs and folk tunes sung by farmers. Therefore, the earliest local operas were vulgar, crude, and simple, and could only be performed on temporary stages and were not considered elegant. Later, once refined by literati, they were like village girls walking into the city, wearing rouge and powder to dress themselves up. The words of the drama, the music of the accompaniment, the props, costumes, etc., were all very particular, and thus the small opera became a large opera. Then, from the small city in a corner, it expanded to the nearby counties, and even the provincial capitals and the capital, and the territory slowly expanded. The audience gradually became universal, and from then on, it was no longer regarded as a local opera. The Pingju opera is the best example of this evolutionary process.

Since the opening of Shanghai as a port, it has become a metropolis where people from all directions gather. People from all over come to see it, so local operas, which provide entertainment for people from all over, are also widely popular in Shanghai. The early Kun opera and the more recent Peking opera have long lost the characteristics of local operas. As for purely local operas, in the past, they were concentrated in amusement parks and occasionally performed in teahouses. It cannot be said to have any status. The main body of the audience is the petty bourgeoisie, and even if there are occasional performances, there will not be many.

After the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the entertainment industry also changed. The spoken drama, which claimed to have a cultural mission, was always unable to gain popularity, and the Ping opera, which had been unique for a hundred years, was also tending to decline, but local operas were very fortunate to develop. At first, the Shen opera seized the position of the Su beach, and the Yue opera was not willing to be outdone and窜rose up. The Bangbang opera of the North, I wonder how many people it fascinated. Now, the Bangbang opera has been silent. The Shen opera and the Yue opera have entered the theater from the teahouse. In the past four or five years, countless wives and milk wives were fascinated, and to this day, they are still considered the two major forces in local opera.

Other forms, such as the Suzhou ballad and storytelling popular in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the large drum books of the North, although they have not been put on stage, can also be regarded as a type of local opera and have been performed in Shanghai. However, pure northern-style large drum books, comic dialogues, and Zhui Zi operas can only occasionally raise their heads and cannot last. On the other hand, the Suzhou ballad and storytelling have attracted a large audience, and especially after the prevalence of radio, they have gradually expanded their influence. In local opera, they are要considered one of the important links.

### The Decline of Suzhou Opera

Tanhuang can be said to be a very common local opera. The current Shanghai Opera, originally named Local Tanhuang, and Yue Opera are also transformations of Tanhuang. In addition, there are Hangzhou Tanhuang, Ningbo Tanhuang, and various others. Suzhou Tanhuang was once extremely popular. During its heyday, Wang Meiyu's popularity far surpassed Yao Shuijuan and Yuan Xuefen today. Indeed, Suzhou Tanhuang is considered relatively refined among local operas. Although the content is also shallow and vulgar, it does not have obscene parts, rarely has low-grade taste, and wins the audience's praise by performing humorous acts and singing popular tunes. It can be said to be both noble and popular entertainment. However, the reason for its decline may also be due to the word "noble."

Suzhou Tanhuang was adapted from Kunqu Opera. Suzhou Tanhuang mostly has what Kunqu Opera has, but the lyrics are not as elegant as Kunqu Opera, and mostly plain and popular, and the spoken language is almost the same as Kunqu Opera. The instruments do not include gongs and drums, nor flutes, but only silk and bamboo instruments for accompaniment. The roles are divided into male, female, painted face, and clown. As for the scripts, there is a distinction between complete plays and excerpted plays. Complete plays, such as The Peony Pavilion, The Story of the Pipa, and Occupying the Flower Queen, are all long plays. Excerpted plays are taken from long plays, such as Broken Bridge, Teasing the Uncle, and Thinking of the Mortal World, which are all main plays, called the "front Tan." There is also an independent short play, biased towards humor, aimed at amusing and entertaining, such as Ma Langdang, Selling Olives, etc., called "back Tan."

Founded by Qian of Wuxian County at the End of the Qing Dynasty

It is said that Suzhou Tanhuang was founded by Qian Mingshu, a scholar from Wuxian County at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Qian was proficient in Kunqu Opera. Because he lamented that the songs were too highbrow and few people could appreciate them, he created a new style, changing the elegant Kunqu Opera into popular Suzhou Tanhuang. Therefore, the "front Tan" is actually a misnomer for "Qian Tan." In fact, Tanhuang already existed during the Qianlong period. Qian adapted a few plays, just like today's literati adapting scripts for actors, which cannot be called creation. However, this kind of local opera, after being touched by literati, is naturally different from others. Moreover, Qian was also proficient in Kunqu Opera, so the rise of Suzhou Tanhuang in the past was no accident.

Suzhou Tanhuang was already very popular in the early years of the Republic of China. Fan Shaoshan was the most popular in Shanghai's Suzhou Tanhuang in the early days. At that time, Shanghai's Suzhou Tanhuang was almost entirely controlled by Fan. Seven or eight out of ten of Fan's disciples were there. A little later than Fan, there was also a Xiao Guisun, who was also very famous. At that time, Suzhou Tanhuang was all sung while sitting. If makeup was added and performed in a theatrical way, it was called "Makeup Suzhou Tanhuang," which was a new style created by Fei Xileng. The Wang Meiyu sisters were the earliest female Suzhou Tanhuang performers, and they were very popular and their business was booming. Then, Jiang Wanzhen, Shi Xiangyun, and others followed suit, creating the golden age of Suzhou Tanhuang.

Shanghai Opera Rises, Suzhou Opera Declines

As Shanghai Opera gradually rises, Suzhou Tanhuang is declining day by day. Now it has been put into a cold palace. Except for a little decoration in amusement parks, no one pays attention to it anymore. The practitioners of Suzhou Tanhuang have changed their careers, and most of the troupes have also disbanded. The only ones left are Zhu Guoliang and a few others, who, because of their outstanding composing and singing skills, are able to support this broken situation. The reason for the decline of Suzhou Tanhuang is not because of changes in the audience's preferences. It is because of the social and economic changes over the years, many leisured classes need more low-level, more vulgar and obscene things. Since Suzhou Tanhuang cannot cater to the audience, its decline is inevitable.

Hangzhou Tanhuang, which Hanghzou people call Ankang, and Ningbo Tanhuang, sometimes abbreviated as Yong Opera, have never seen any special progress in Tanhuang, but they can still maintain their original status. Especially Ningbo Tanhuang, because Ningbo people occupy a large influence in Shanghai's financial circles, it will not completely decline. As for Changzhou, Wuxi and other places, there are also Tanhuang, but its popularity is limited to the surrounding area, and it does not have much influence in Shanghai.

### Transferred from Dongxiang Tune to Shanghai Opera

"After sitting, I get up, and the young daughter of the Zhang family sighs about her life. Suddenly, she remembers something in her heart, remembers a story about housework. My parents didn't raise three sons and four daughters, but only raised a pair of us siblings..."

Ladies and misses who are worried about listening to Shanghai Opera can almost hum this passage. Shanghai Opera is now called Huju, probably because the two words Huju are more refined. In the countryside, it is called "Tanhuang", also called "Local Tanhuang", indicating some differences from "Suzhou Tanhuang" and "Ningbo Tanhuang." Shanghai Opera was originally "Dongxiang Tune," originated in Pudong, so until now, the language in Shanghai Opera is still completely Pudong accent. Before that, it was "Flower Drum Opera." In the Shanghai Prosperity Records published in the tenth year of Guangxu (1884), there is a poem about Flower Drum Opera: "Gathering fairies in Changyue Building, charming voices sing out Xiao Zhutian, listening to it is the most heart-stirring, laugh and call the sweetheart to sleep together."

The "Xiao Zhutian" mentioned in the poem is one of the Shanghai Opera scripts, so the origin of Shanghai Opera is not too late. At that time, Shanghai Opera and Flower Drum Opera were almost confused, but Flower Drum Opera has drama performances, while Shanghai Opera's "Dongxiang Tune" only has tunes and no drama.

Flower Drum

Flower Drum Opera has always been regarded as obscene, because there are many suggestive erotic parts in its performance, lyrics, and dialogues. Most people look down on the "actors" who sing Flower Drum Opera. The performers also think that this name is too dishonorable, so they have repeatedly changed the name. During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, Zhu Lian, a Qingpu man, wrote a book "Mingzhai Xiaoshi", in which there is a record of Flower Drum Opera, which begins by saying: "Flower Drum Opera has been around for less than thirty years, and has changed many times!"

It is now difficult to check the year of birth of Flower Drum Opera, but according to the above-mentioned "Mingzhai Xiaoshi" sentence, it can be inferred that it was around forty years before Qianlong. At first, it was played during the day, and later it was changed to be done at night. According to Songnan Yuefu, the instruments used are: men beat gongs, women beat drums at both ends, and harmonize with huqin and flute boards. At first, the actors were all men, but later women also participated. However, many of the female actors in Flower Drum Opera were unprincipled women, which also became an important reason for Flower Drum Opera itself to suffer dishonor. Mao Duishan's Moyu Record says: "When the Shanghai Concession was first established, there were Flower Drum Grannies among the prostitutes." This shows a glimpse of the situation at that time.

Those Who Forbid, Forbid Themselves; Those Who Sing, Sing Themselves

Flower Drum Opera is often banned because of its obscenity, but because it is easy to understand and popular, it is very popular among the people, so those who forbid, forbid themselves, and those who sing, sing themselves. In the second year of the Republic of China, when Wu Xin was the magistrate of Shanghai County, he commissioned Li Qi as the director of the Popular Education Office and organized a popular lecture country, which included "improving Flower Drum." The following year, Shi Lanting, Shao Wenbin, Hu Xuechang and others initiated the Zhenxin Collection and renamed it Shanghai Opera, but the content was "still the same."

Shanghai Opera scripts are divided into "big plays" and "small plays." Plays like Catching Tooth Worms and Selling Water Chestnuts are small plays, and plays like Lu Yachen Selling His Wife are big plays. The plot of the small plays is very simple, mostly one man and one woman, flirting and scolding each other, and chatting for a while. Take the "Catching Tooth Worms" play as an example: Characters: Small Thief—Male role

Catching Tooth Worms Wife—Female role

Plot: Meeting on the road, the thief invites to catch tooth

worms, Guanwang, fortune-telling, looking at wind

water, making a fuss.

### The Scholar in Distress Wins the Top Prize; A Private Arrangement is Made in the Back Garden

The so-called "big play" of course refers to its relatively complex plot, more characters, and some props and the like. To put it bluntly, its story is also the same, always some "scholar in distress wins the top prize, a private arrangement is made in the back garden", and in the end "the treacherous ministers are all killed, and the imperial decree is a happy reunion", so the audience wipes away their tears, smiles and gets up, and walks out of the theater...

The lyrics of Shanghai Opera are as monotonous as the plot of the story. For example, the opening is either "After sitting, I get up" or "The sun rises in the east and shines on the window screen", describing walking fast is "three steps changed to two steps, walking one mile to pass one village", singing that someone is about to die is "the King of Hell is destined to die at three o'clock, and will not keep people until five o'clock", describing a young girl is definitely "twenty-nine to marry the son-in-law is eighteen years old"... and so on, there are many. The tune is simple, each sentence is often seven characters, completely made up of local words, such as "Hao Hao Zao Zao turns the door", "Never posted to marry an official", "Thinking in the stomach and discussing in the heart", "After watching, wrap the body" and so on. People like us who don't like to listen to Shanghai Opera always feel a little impatient.

### Rivers, Lakes, Rivers, Seas, Clear Waves, Passing Far Beyond the Carefree Dao

Occasionally, there are also "thoughtful" things in the lyrics, such as many big or small plays that like to use characters with the same radicals, such as "Rivers, lakes, rivers, seas, clear waves, passing far beyond the carefree Dao," using couplets, such as "Yu, Xia, Shang, Zhou, Han, five hundred Hanlin scholars, thousands of Jinshi; Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing, thirteen pavilion elders, nine dukes" and so on. There is also the opening of "Little Widow Selling Rice":

"Fragrant lotus and clear water move with the cool breeze, the water moves with the cool breeze and the days are longer, the long days are cool in summer, the wind moves the water, the cool breeze moves the water, the green lotus is fragrant", which is composed with palindrome, although it is simply "unrelated" to the main text, but these "small gimmicks" can still grab many audiences. Another example is the section of "Lu Yachen Asks His Mother-in-Law", each sentence is embedded with the name of tea leaves, and the section sung by the Dan at the opening of "Xiao Farewell" is embedded with the name of medicine in each sentence. Furthermore, maximizing the use of number games is also a unique gimmick in Shanghai Opera.

### Shanghai Opera

After Shanghai Opera invaded the city from the countryside, it was initially located in tea houses. Because the official authorities cracked down and hooligans harassed, it was performed intermittently. It was not until the opening of the amusement park that it had the opportunity to develop. But the first amusement park, like "Lou Wai Lou", did not have a Shanghai Opera venue. Later, Huang Chuju founded the New World Club near Nicheng Bridge. Knowing that some tourists like to listen to local operas, he also recruited Shanghai Opera. At that time, "Ben Tan" was performed, because there were not many audiences, and the theater was located in a small venue. Later, Huang opened the Great World again, and Ben Tan began to strive to compete with Suzhou Tanhuang. The female protagonist used female performances and no longer "men dressed as women", and used makeup technology. Shanghai Opera gradually became popular. Wang Xiaoxin, Shi Chunxuan, Xiao Wenbin, Ma Jinsheng, Zhu Quangen and others were all popular roles in Shanghai Opera more than ten years ago. Now, Xiao Wenbin and Shi Chunxuan are still leading Shanghai Opera. After the popularity of radio, Shanghai Opera used broadcast advertisements to expand its influence and laid the foundation. During the Anti-Japanese War, various local dramas flourished on the isolated island, and Shanghai Opera was unwilling to let others, so it went from the amusement park to the theater. Most of the five million people in Shanghai speak the local language, and Shanghai Opera, which is purely performed in local dialect, is of course very popular. Coupled with the progress of commerce and the prosperity of the market, its influence should increase unabated.

However, the fragility of the foundation of Shanghai Opera is an undeniable fact. Therefore, when performing, the script is not good, the singing, dialogue, stage steps, etc. are plain and messy, and too little attention is paid to them. The roles are mixed, the costumes cannot match, and the directing techniques are chaotic. There are many flaws. When modern drama is moving towards new places, Shanghai Opera itself really needs to be improved to avoid being eliminated. In this regard, Shanghai Opera actors and researchers should work hard and never hold on to the old and destroy the life of Shanghai Opera. As for the method of improvement, many advanced drama people have already researched it, so I don't need to nag here, so I'll stop here.

### Bengbeng Opera Has a Unique Value of Existence; I Hope That Those Engaged in Popular Literature Movement Will Organize and Improve It

Speaking of Bai Yushuang, old Shanghai people should remember it. At that time, she performed on stage, and I don’t know how many people were fascinated. Because it originated around Tangshan. As for the origin of the name "Bengbeng Opera", it is mostly because the instrument used in the opera is mainly bangzi, which is a round bar made of hardwood, about an inch in diameter and five or six inches long. Another wooden hammer is used to knock. The sound is unusually loud, "beng beng beng" non-stop, so it is called Bengbeng Opera. At first, it was almost the same as "playing tricks." The performers used bangzi to gather the audience and performed everywhere when going to fairs or markets. In fact, Bengbeng Opera has another name, called "Fengtian Ping Opera," which is more vulgar, that is, "Fengtian Luozi."

The so-called "Ping Opera" is actually to stage "Ping Shu". For example, in "Ma Widow Opens a Shop", Ma Widow always has a sentence when she enters the stage: "Here comes the beauty Ma Widow". For example, in "Du Shiniang" and "Pearl Shirt", the people who go off the stage often sing the last sentence: "Press ×× and don't show it", so the people who go on stage continue to sing: "Show Jiaowa ××× again". These fully demonstrate the form of Ping Shu, but Ping Shu is played by one person playing many roles, while Ping Opera assigns roles and adds some bangzi tunes.

The source of Bengbeng Opera is Ping Shu, so many characteristics are the same. The first is "popular", the words and dialogues are all in colloquial language, and the tone is the same as usual. Wherever the background of the script is, the local dialect is used, and every word and every sentence is easy to understand, so women and children like to listen to it. The second is "delicate". People who have listened to Ping Shu know that the storyteller tells the details of the story in detail. Bengbeng Opera is also the same. A room can sing three or four hundred words. Du Shiniang has several long sections of lyrics after being sent away, describing the evolution of her psychology.

The advantages are as described above, but the disadvantages are also very many. Because it is a product of feudal society, the whole is an old form and an old content. For example, the singing is sometimes vulgar and incomprehensible, and the rhyme is forced. For example, there is a section in "Dalong Prostitutes": "I have read Chinese and history, self-cultivation, geography, and literature, making poems and writing essays, drumming and blowing the horn to exercise, I have graduated from higher primary school, and there is a diploma in the box". This kind of "delicacy" is really dare not accept it, especially the sentence "do exercise", it's simply outrageous! This also shows its low cultural level. Furthermore, the lyrics of the play are incoherent before and after, and the plot is contradictory. The so-called "complete" play has many superfluous places, which are nagging and annoying. In terms of the content of the script itself, they are all licentious plays and jokes. The word "consciousness" is not mentioned at all. However, having said that, Bengbeng Opera is not really something that "disdains a glance". Although it is not "great elegance", it also has a unique value of existence and has become a kind of folk art. Therefore, what is hoped is that people engaged in popular literature movement should organize and improve it, and use new, meaningful and vital content to replace those old, corrupt and feudal products.

The topic turns to the situation of Bengbeng Opera in Shanghai: Shanghai is like a big pot, no matter sweet, sour, bitter or spicy, it needs to accommodate some Bengbeng Opera. Of course, Bengbeng Opera has to come to Shanghai to get a share. At first, in the sixteenth and seventeenth years of the Republic of China, there was a Bengbeng Opera troupe in the miscellaneous class of the Great World. This was probably the first Bengbeng Opera troupe to come to Shanghai. But the performance was not good. Except for a few "fellow villagers", almost no one went to ask about it.

Bengbeng Opera became popular in Shanghai in the winter of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China. Zhu Baoxia, the female role of Bengbeng Opera, was invited to Shanghai and opened a "Hebei Theater" downstairs in the New World. Since then, Bengbeng Opera began to perform alone in Shanghai. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Bai Yushuang was expelled to Shanghai by the local mayor in Beijing for "obstructing customs". Someone invited him to perform at the Central Theater. At that time, the ticket sold for one yuan, which was quite "expensive", but because Bai Yu's expression was coquettish, she was able to attract general erotic audiences. Therefore, Bengbeng Opera was very popular, and plays such as "Ma Widow Opens a Shop" and "Shooting the Little Old Mom" became popular among Shanghai citizens.

However, the reason why Bengbeng Opera can be popular in Shanghai is entirely due to the effect of the sex appeal. The licentious words and gestures are unbearable to look at, which is really a sad phenomenon for Bengbeng Opera itself. Now, Shanghai people have been away from Bengbeng Opera for a long time, and it is rare for anyone to think of it. Bengbeng Opera has gone into decline.

### Yangzhou Opera

In Shanghai, in addition to the "Weiyang Class" performed in amusement parks, there are also dozens of theaters specializing in this kind of opera. They are mostly located near small vegetable markets or tea countries, attracting a lot of audiences, of course, purely small citizens.

Yangzhou Opera was originally the "Yancheng Class" popular in the six counties of North Huai, and the plays performed were all about love affairs between men and women. The number of people in each class is not large, ranging from more than ten to two or thirty people, with male and clown roles, and the roles are complete. They never advertise, but the business is always very good, especially in January, February and March of each year, it is almost always full. When business is slow in winter, they try to change classes and exchange the actors of the two theaters. Or maybe there will be a grand gathering. Recently, "Tongshang" in Nicheng Bridge has performed a grand gathering of twelve classes.

The Yangzhou theater is a multi-event place. Three-light mafiosi can freely enter and exit. If the ticket collector has not broken into the street, he can forget about taking on this job. It is very common for quarrels to occur over supplementing tickets or not being allowed to enter. So there are "tycoons" among the hoodlums who come to serve as special consultants. Although the theater loses a salary, it avoids a lot of trouble.

On the radio station, Weiyang Opera also once invaded and gradually became valued. Like other local operas, it is mediocre, shallow, and obscene, but it is full of low-level tastes, so it can grasp many audiences.

### The Once Popular Yue Opera: The Most Flourishing Period in Shanghai Reached as Many as Thirty Theaters

Yue Opera and Shen Opera are undoubtedly the two major bulwarks of local opera in Shanghai today. Their popular plots and large audiences have surprisingly swept the city. The elegant Kun Opera has certainly declined, and the traditional Peking Opera (Pi Huang) has also become a spent force. Yue Opera has a grand ambition to rise and replace them. However, recalling the rise and fall of the Suzhou Opera (Su Tan), Ningbo Opera (Yong Ju), and Bang Bang Opera, it is still unknown whether Yue Opera can maintain its lasting fate.

Yue Opera is commonly called Shaoxing Opera, but its origin does not come from Shaoxing, but from Sheng County, which is adjacent to Shaoxing. If it is said to be Shaoxing Opera, then there are Luan Tan and Gao Qiang, which are the real Shaoxing Opera. The currently popular Yue Opera, that is, what is commonly called "Di Du Ban," is only performed in the Zhuji and Sheng County areas. It is entirely a form of popular entertainment during the agricultural off-season. The reason why the plot is called "Di Du Ban" is because it only uses two very simple musical instruments: the clapper board and the Di drum.

Yue Opera only has a history of thirty years. It was originally a popular local song and ditty. In the early years of the Republic of China, someone adapted it, gathered a few like-minded people, temporarily set up a stage, and performed it hastily. Although it was very simple and crude, it was quite popular among the local farmers, and thus became a small opera popular in one area. It was indispensable for paying tribute to the gods and enlivening the celebrations. Because the plot is simple and does not require many people, it is very suitable for mobile performances. They perform outside during the agricultural off-season, after the cold winter, and before Qingming Festival. In the early years, it only cost three or five yuan to perform for a whole night. Sometimes, even just providing a meal was enough.

The Lyrics Are Very Simple

Most of the earliest Yue Opera were adapted from mountain songs and ditties, and inevitably contained obscene content, so they were forbidden by the authorities. However, the countryside was far away, and the officials' eyes and ears were not comprehensive. The forbidding officials forbade, and the performers performed. Later, there were more and more performance opportunities, and many new scripts were written. They could not escape the cliches of "private engagement in the back garden, and the fallen young master becoming the top scholar." The erotic connotation was quite strong, and this was precisely why it could cater to the tastes of many people.

The lyrics of Yue Opera are very simple, usually in two forms: seven-character and ten-character, which are very similar to storytelling (Tan Ci), and may have been adapted from storytelling. When singing, the lengthy coda, "Ha ah ha ah," is dragged on for more than a dozen times. This is a style inherited from the Gao Qiang troupes. Because in the earliest days, in addition to the clapper board and the Di drum for keeping time, there was no musical instrument accompaniment. The actors took the opportunity to rest, so they had to use human voices to replace the interludes. As for the musical aspect, it is much more complex than before. In addition to the original drum and clapper, there is also string accompaniment, and the Huqin (two-stringed fiddle) has become an indispensable instrument. At the same time, many new tunes have been added, and Yue Opera is no longer so shabby.

All-Female Cast

In the early years, Yue Opera performances were not limited to women. Probably many poor families, affected by the decline of the countryside, contacted their daughters, between the ages of twelve and seventeen or eighteen, taught them to act, performed in nearby villages, and then went out to do business. However, there were still many men in the troupe. However, women acting could better cater to the audience's psychology. As far as men were concerned, they knew that they were women. As far as women were concerned, they regarded them as men. Therefore, women took precedence, and today Yue Opera is an all-female cast. Since Yue Opera is popular, many people follow suit. In Sheng County alone, there are about seventy or eighty troupes. Many places nearby also invite teachers from Sheng County to teach opera, so there are not few who form troupes. Over time, Yue Opera is no longer the exclusive domain of the people of Sheng County.

It only took ten years for Yue Opera to go from a makeshift stage to a teahouse to a theater. I don't know what good fortune it had, but it surprisingly rose three levels at once. Before the war, although Yue Opera was not included in the programs of amusement parks in Shanghai, it was called Shaoxing Wen Opera, but it did not attract much attention. The few "Di Du Ban" opera houses in the Zhabei Xinjiang Road Haining Road area also performed and stopped from time to time due to government intervention. The "New Drama Examination" published in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) did not include Yue Opera lyrics, which shows that it was still unknown. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, its influence extended to theaters, thus laying its solid foundation.

The Support of the Nouveau Riche

The main reason why Yue Opera was able to rise from the ground is that the plot is popular and caters to the audience. In particular, the nouveau riche who have made a fortune from the national crisis want to enjoy some entertainment, but they cannot understand art that is too profound. Only this kind of local opera is most suitable for their tastes. At the same time, Yue Opera stories mostly tell about love affairs between men and women, full of erotic connotations, and are performed by women, which can further satisfy their desires. Yue Opera has received a lot of support from this group of nouveau riche. Yue Opera itself, like the nouveau riche, suddenly flourished.

But then again, relying solely on the one-sided support of the audience cannot last. The reason why Yue Opera has what it is today is also due to the efforts of practitioners to constantly improve. In terms of clothing, it takes Peking Opera as a model in every way. The music has gradually changed from simple to complex. The gongs and drums are beaten, and the string instruments are accompanied. In terms of acting skills, they try their best to figure out the psychology of the characters in the play. There are also many newly written scripts, which are completely free from the constraints of old scripts. They have put a lot of effort into the art, and their progress is naturally unmatched by other local operas. Recently, they have also used the techniques of spoken drama, such as scenery and lighting, and even facial expressions and movements, and studied them in every way. The newly written "Xianglin's Wife" is an extraordinary work among many Yue Operas, thus greatly increasing the value of Yue Opera. The actors of Yue Opera, under the banner of reform, are marching towards a bright future. Now, in terms of "quality," "quantity," and "decoration," it has undergone a complete transformation, and the number of people who love it is of course more than before.

Gradually Reducing the Past Glory

At its peak, there were as many as thirty Yue Opera theaters in Shanghai, making Peking Opera, which has a long history, and spoken drama, which has a cultural mission, look at it with admiration. Yue Opera has indeed risen from the small villages of eastern Zhejiang, its active traces spreading throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The areas of Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo are adjacent to each other and have long been spread. Recently, even the areas of southern Jiangsu, Suzhou and Changzhou have become their territory. The tens of thousands of audiences in Shanghai are no longer just people from the south of the Yangtze River. Judging from its popularity, it is indeed worthy of looking down on everything, but things in the world are cyclical. When things reach their peak, they must decline. Yue Opera troupes call for "reform," but the so-called reform, which is truly up to standard, has a very miserable box office. This is something that people cannot figure out. The general Yue Opera theaters are also gradually reducing their former glory, and the talk of closing down is brewing everywhere. It can be seen that Yue Opera has begun to restrain its brilliance of the past few years, and there is a danger of going downhill.

### The Cotton Yarn Control Committee and Various Cotton Mills Discuss the Calculation Ratio of Cotton Yarn. The Last Allocation of Yarn Will Be Distributed Today.

The measures and prices for the Cotton Yarn Control Committee's purchase of half of the yarn and cloth produced by the yarn mills in the Shanghai urban area have been approved by President Song. The committee is actively preparing for the purchase and drafting detailed rules. Once the committee meeting this week approves it, it can be implemented. Yesterday afternoon, the Business Department of the committee specially invited representatives of state-owned and private yarn mills, Wang Qiyu, Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, etc., to discuss the re-determination of the calculation ratio of cotton yarn counts and the grading of export materials of various factories, and exchanged opinions. It is heard that an agreement has been reached and will be approved together at the committee meeting.

In addition, the last allocation of yarn by the Cotton Textile Industry Association is scheduled to be distributed today. The allocated price is 1.975 million yuan per piece of 20-count yarn. The calculation ratio of yarn counts remains the same.

Yang Yinpu Talks About Stock Exchange: New Plans Are Being Drafted. Enemy and Puppet Property and Foreign Stock Can Generally Be Listed This Year.

[Report from This Newspaper] A reporter visited the famous economist Yang Yinpu yesterday to inquire about various issues. He kindly answered them as follows: (1) What are your opinions on the method of re-evaluating the assets of industrial and commercial enterprises? Mr. Yang believes that the promulgation of these measures is the most wise measure taken by the government in recent years. In the past, the biggest trouble for general industrial and commercial enterprises was that the value of fixed assets could not be balanced with the working capital. After the government announced this measure, it is tantamount to opening up a long-term source of funds for industrial and commercial enterprises, enabling floating capital to join the production work. Its significance is far greater than providing temporary production loans. In the future, industrial and commercial enterprises can smoothly increase capital and will no longer be threatened by high interest rates. Probably when the business community closes accounts at the end of the lunar year, they will be able to feel the good effects of this move. Mr. Yang believes that this one-fifth of cash capital increase is necessary. Otherwise, shareholders will only take more stocks because of this new measure, and the capital of the business they operate will not increase at all. (2) What new plans does the Stock Exchange have this year? New plans are being drafted. Within this year, the stocks of some enemy and puppet property and foreign stock can generally be listed. The current stock prices are stable, which is a good phenomenon. The announcement of the asset revaluation method will have a new impact on stock market prices in the long run. (3) In the current economic situation, is it appropriate to adopt a tight credit policy? Answer: In the past three or four years during the War of Resistance Against Japan, there was a shortage of materials and currency inflation. Therefore, I advocated a tight credit policy at that time. However, when market interest rates are very high and prices are relatively stable, a tight credit policy will make industrial and commercial enterprises suffer from high interest rates. In summary, whether this policy is correct should be determined by the actual situation. (4) What are your views on this year's finances? Politics and economics are inseparable, and it is difficult to make predictions at this time. However, I personally believe that the government has a well-thought-out plan for increasing revenue. For example, the period originally set for the state-run China Textile Corporation was two years, but it is now coming to an end. If the government sells its shares when necessary, the income will be amazing. As for the reform of the monetary system, I personally believe that it is not yet the time, because the factors that make the currency value unstable have not yet been eliminated.

### Prices Rise Again; The Social Bureau Sends Staff to Investigate Thoroughly

After the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau made every effort to suppress the soaring prices at the end of last year, the price surge was slightly curbed. Unexpectedly, since the new year, due to the approaching lunar New Year and the increased needs of the people, unscrupulous merchants have become active again, so prices have fluctuated again in recent days, especially the price of rice, which has risen sharply. Taking the previous lessons as a warning, the Municipal Social Bureau decided to mobilize all the staff of the Price Management Section to go to various markets to be responsible for monitoring transactions in order to ensure that the people can safely spend the New Year. According to the person in charge of the Economic Administration Department of the bureau, the authorities have the greatest determination to suppress prices in the city and have repeatedly reiterated previous orders. Although the Gregorian New Year has been safely spent, the future of the lunar New Year is uncertain. It is hoped that the citizens will abide by the government's policy of suppressing prices and not violate it in any way, so as to work together to overcome the difficulties.

### Hongxiang Money Exchange Reopens

Hongxiang Money Exchange was one of the Shanghai remittance money exchanges before the war. It has now been approved by the Ministry of Finance and will reopen on January 6. The general manager, Feng Zuozhou, is the son of Mr. Feng Shouzhi, a senior figure in the financial world. His knowledge and experience are very rich and appropriate. The manager, Luo Wenji, the deputy manager, Wu Weibin, and the assistant manager, Qin Qiuru, are all well-known figures in the financial world.

### Remittance Evasion is Astonishing

Reaching 10 Million US Dollars per Month

Overseas remittances, which are related to the balance of international payments, have been decreasing in recent months. As of recently, the trend of overseas remittance evasion has become increasingly rampant. According to investigations by relevant parties, the amount of overseas remittances evaded between Hong Kong and Guangzhou reaches 10 million US dollars per month, which is a shocking figure. According to the Bank of China's report, the monthly overseas remittance income used to be 5 million US dollars, but now it is only about 2 million, a difference of three-fifths. The reason for the evasion is nothing more than the impact of foreign exchange problems. The official exchange rate set by the government is 3350, while the black market is as high as 6000. The official rate is too low, and the black market is too high. This is the biggest factor in overseas remittance evasion. As for the evasion methods, they are entrusted to US dollar drafts and Hong Kong dollars. The first type of US dollar draft was originally used by A town in the United States to remit to B town. Merchants can purchase it and send it to the United States to pay for goods. The second type of Hong Kong dollar draft can be collected in cash in Hong Kong. The Bank of China is actively discussing with the Central Bank to save overseas remittance evasion. President Bei's visit to Hong Kong this time is also related to this issue.

### Pharmaceutical Industry Requests Loans; None Have Been Approved

According to the person in charge of the pharmaceutical industry: (1) The industry's loans are currently being applied for individually, but because the restrictions are quite strict, the procedures are complicated, and many banks are unwilling to handle them. Therefore, as of now, only 12 companies have applied, and the amount of loans applied for is only about 5 billion. However, no one has been approved so far. Although the entire pharmaceutical industry has safely passed the Gregorian New Year, if the government does not provide rapid relief, at least half of the members will go bankrupt or stranded during the lunar New Year. Therefore, the future of the pharmaceutical industry is still not optimistic. (2) In the past, the association has submitted requests to the Health Bureau, the Materials Supply Bureau, and the Import Management Committee, etc., to bundle sales of domestically produced Western medicines and to restrict and prohibit the import of foreign goods, but they have not yet been approved. In addition to strictly regulating itself and stepping up the transformation of its products in order to seek self-reliance, the industry is very disappointed that the requirements submitted to the above bureaus and committees have been shelved.

### Japanese Businesses Allowed to Communicate Abroad; Foreign Trade Begins to Recover

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Picard, a trade expert at the Allied Supreme Commander's Headquarters, said that under the newly promulgated postal regulations in Japan, Japanese importers and exporters may begin to lay the foundation for restoring peacetime trade, but they still cannot directly sell goods or sign shipping contracts, because Japan's foreign trade still adopts the position of direct transactions between governments. After the wartime postal regulations were relaxed, Japanese businesses were allowed to exchange commercial letters with foreign businesses, but these letters must be inspected, and their content is limited to the following: (1) the size, style, and color of exportable goods; (2) inquiries about the sales of pre-war exports and new products; (3) the approximate quantity of manufactured goods available for export. In the future, Japanese businesses can open up foreign markets through communication, but they must apply to the Japanese Trade Bureau for an export permit. After being approved by the Allied Supreme Commander's Headquarters, the Trade Bureau will purchase the required export goods from the merchant in Japanese yen and then handle the export procedures between governments as usual. Mr. Picard said that the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the currencies of various countries has not yet been determined, so Japanese businesses and foreign businesses should not discuss prices. Although communication regarding imports is allowed, it is not very helpful at present, because the available funds are limited to the raw materials that Japan needs most, and the import of raw materials will be handled directly by the Allied Commander's Headquarters in contact with foreign commercial institutions. Although the resumption of communication between Japanese businesses and foreign businesses is an important step in the restoration of Japanese foreign trade to private trade, and it can expand the scope of future trade.

### Bankruptcy Statistics: A Total of 1,200 Companies Bankrupted Last Year, with Pharmaceutical Factories Accounting for the Most

The various industries in the city were not very prosperous last year. As of the end of the Gregorian calendar year, it is known that a total of more than 1,200 shops and factories went bankrupt in the city. Among them, the pharmaceutical industry accounted for the most. There are more than 300 pharmaceutical companies in the city, and as many as 225 went bankrupt. In the financial sector, a total of 21 went bankrupt. The number of bankruptcies in other industries is also countless. It is estimated that a total of more than 1,200 companies went bankrupt or were liquidated in the city.

### High Costs Lead to Few Exports

A reporter recently learned from export merchants that since the implementation of reasonable control over import and export trade, the current foreign exchange rate in our country will generally not change temporarily. Although import merchants benefit from it, those engaged in export trade feel deeply distressed. After the war, all countries, especially those from the begining: raw silk, tea, tung oil, silk, embroidery, porcelain, fur, carpets, etc., are in great demand. Inquiries from overseas are enthusiastic, but exporters mostly lose money, and the prices are too high, and they cannot make a deal, so it is a pity that the great international market has not been won. The crux of the problem lies in the fact that the exporter must sell the foreign exchange earnings obtained from the sale of goods to the Central Bank at the official price. The loss in this is huge. If exporters were allowed to freely sell foreign exchange to importers or others who need it, then our country's products could compete with other countries in the foreign market.

### Nanchang's Finance Remains Tight

[Report from This Newspaper, Nanchang, 5th] The Nanchang market after the New Year has not slightly reduced the appearance of financial tightening. The prices of various goods fluctuate irregularly due to this reason, either rising or falling. Foreign yarns and gold rise with the New Year, each rising by tens of thousands: 20-count Golden Star (241) million, finished gold goes in at 3.4 million, comes out at 3.8 million. Grain and oils prices are weaker because there is stronger source: tea oil is 105,000 and raw oil is 96,000. Goods from the south increase in price due to the active sales from the lunar New Year.

### Good News for the Silk Industry: Sino-American Corporation Accepts Commission to Purchase Our Country's Silk

Since General Chennault retired from the military, he has been engaged in commercial activities. In addition to establishing an air transport squadron and signing a contract with the Executive Yuan, he also organized the Sino-American Corporation to engage in import and export trade. It is now known that the Sino-American Corporation has recently accepted a commission from an American importer to order a large batch of silk in our country. Therefore, Chen has sent someone to discuss with the silk weaving industry in Shanghai. The silk weaving merchants did not dare to accept it rashly due to the raw material supply problem. Later, the Central Trust Bureau agreed to purchase all the raw silk and allocate it as much as possible. The raw material problem is generally solved. Therefore, after the quantity and pattern required by the Sino-American Corporation are issued, the two parties can sign a contract. It is heard that the quantity ordered by the United States is very considerable. In the midst of the silk industry's precarious voice, it is also good news that a large number of exports can be made.

### The United States Needs Far Eastern Products to Maintain Current Production

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Paul, Director of the International Trade Department of the US Department of Commerce, issued a statement tonight: If the current production volume in the United States continues to be maintained, the amount of products from Far Eastern countries that the United States will need in 1947 will be larger. Mr. Paul said that if the United States wants to maintain its foreign trade, it must reduce its high tariffs in 1947 as an exchange condition for concessions from other countries. Mr. Paul continued: "The total exports of the United States in 1947 may exceed 11 billion yuan. If the United States continues to maintain its current industrial production volume, the amount of raw materials and manufactured products from Europe, Latin America, and Far Eastern countries that the United States will need in 1947 will be larger than in the past.

### American Textile Export Association Advocates Amending Agreement

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The Textile Export Association recently suggested to the United States Tariff Commission that the current tariff rates of the United States on Cuba, China, Lebanon, and Norway should be frozen and promote commerce with countries that have large gold pound surpluses. Regarding the forthcoming reciprocal trade agreement, the association advocates that the US government should resolutely amend the preferential agreement so that American textile exporters can compete with Lancashire on an equal footing in the British market.

### Japan's Compensation Materials to China Will Be Offset by Machinery and Industry. The Caustic Soda Factory Will Be Dismantled and Relocated Soon.

[Report from This Newspaper] Reliable sources say that among the industrial materials that Japan will compensate to China, steel industry machinery and caustic soda industrial equipment are the most numerous. After this batch of equipment is transported to China, it will be received by state-owned and private industries under certain conditions. Relevant people pointed out that China's future caustic soda factories will be densely distributed on the coastline from Qinhuangdao in the north to Hainan Island in the south. It is also heard that among the caustic soda industrial equipment transported to China by Japan, the largest factory has a total of three. One of them has been applied for by a large chemical giant in the city. The difficulty lies in the transportation and the large amount of working capital required for use, which needs the full assistance of the government.

### Northeast Economic Trends (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao

While the "currency collapse" is fiercely sweeping across Beijing and Shanghai, the Northeast is also facing an economic crisis. As the year thirty-six begins, the crisis is intensifying. Since everyone recognizes the Northeast as China's lifeline, the critical question is how to rescue the Northeast's economy, to save the Northeast, and to save ourselves. The first task is to clearly understand the current economic situation in the Northeast.

The current problem in the Northeast is that heavy industry is struggling to recover, the economy is on the verge of exhaustion, and the only agricultural products it relies on—soybeans and sorghum—have no outlet due to transportation difficulties, leaving everything without a solution. The "Trade Problem Symposium" recently held by the Shenyang Heping Daily newspaper社 reveals some general information through the words of some participating economic experts.

Industrial and Mining Crisis

Xie Shuying, Director of the Northeast Office of the Fee Committee and Director of the Fushun Coal Mine, said: The Northeast's industry and mining are currently facing a crisis. The period between March and April of this year will be the most critical stage. If a reasonable solution is not sought, it will fall into an unthinkable situation.

Taking Fushun coal as an example, the lack of equipment and the shortage of technical personnel are the most serious problems. Currently, many mines have excessive water accumulation, and there is a great shortage of water pumps. Other accessories were mostly dilapidated and unusable when received, which naturally affects production. Other essential equipment for coal mines, such as transportation belts, timber, and supports, are also desperately lacking. If they cannot be replenished by March or April of this year, and the water cannot be pumped out of the mines, they will inevitably be flooded.

Exporting minerals from the Northeast was not originally difficult. Electricity and coal are the driving forces behind all light and heavy industries. As long as electricity and coal are not a problem, other heavy industries such as steel and light industries such as papermaking and chemicals can gradually prosper. After prosperity, the development of export trade is imaginable.

At the same time, the exchange of goods between inside and outside the customs can also be smoothly promoted. A large amount of equipment and daily necessities can be transported from inside the customs, while coal and steel can be transported from outside the customs. Under reasonable conditions, it is estimated that five million tons of coal can be transported out this year. In short, everything should be planned and managed holistically to achieve rationalization.

B said of Steel: American steel has already arrived in Shanghai, and the current price is even cheaper than ours inside the customs. What trade are we talking about? If the government does not make a major decision this year to formulate a policy to revive industry and mining in the Northeast, then there will only be failure. Therefore, in addition to investing heavily to supplement equipment, the authorities should also solve the problem of production and sales, which is also decisive for the Northeast's foreign trade.

In short, this year can be said to be a stage for the reorganization of industry and mining in the Northeast, and whether foreign trade can be promoted must also be laid on this year.

Cheap Grain Hurts Farmers

Jin Enqi, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and Chairman of the Shenyang Chamber of Commerce, said: Recently, grain prices have generally fallen, and "cheap grain hurts farmers," which is not a good phenomenon. For example, recently many farmers who have been allocated small collective agricultural land are asking to return the land to landlords because last year's harvest cannot sustain them until this year's planting. The market prices of soybeans, cotton, and sorghum are too low, and the rural areas have no purchasing power, which cannot be solved unless large-scale trade is possible. Otherwise, the production of small-scale daily necessities will also be impossible to develop. Currently, coal prices are high and sales are sluggish, and grain prices are low, so many people are using soybeans as fuel, which is especially regrettable to mention.

Wang Nianzu, Deputy Director of the Commercial Affairs Department of the Northeast Headquarters Economic Commission, stated: When talking about soybeans, we must talk about the issue of soybean exports. Mr. Wang said: "Soybean exports were less than two million tons when Japan controlled the Northeast, and sorghum was only over one million tons, followed by miscellaneous grains. Regarding food, when the Japanese controlled the Northeast, they used financial policies to purchase food seeds, and one-third of the money released always circulated outside.

Now, due to the difficulty of technical personnel and the high risk, when no one buys large quantities of food, only the government can buy it to release it when there is a shortage of new and old crops. The Economic Commission has planned to handle large-scale purchases, hoping that soybean exports can reach about 500,000 tons this year. About 10,000 tons of soybeans have been exported to inside the customs, and less to outside the customs. Recently, preparations have been made to export 20,000 tons. Currently, there is no way to dispatch vehicles. The fact is that there are few vehicles, many military transports, and the railways that were destroyed by the communist army have mostly changed from double tracks to single tracks, so transportation is indeed a difficult problem at present.

The Sadness of Soybeans

Zhang Youjiang, Deputy Director of the Commercial Affairs Department of the Northeast Headquarters Economic Commission, stated that realistically speaking, the main product of the Northeast is soybeans. According to a survey, the soybean production in the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Andong, and Liaobei, the amount sold on the market in the 31st year of the Republic of China was 292,425 metric tons. This year, the production in the recovered areas of the four provinces is 8,034,000 metric tons. The research results show that assuming the population in the recovered areas of the four provinces is 20 million (actually more), each person needs four jin of soybean oil and fifty jin of soybeans per year, then the total amount needed is 500,000 metric tons. Then the exportable amount of soybeans is 200,000 metric tons, plus the existing 150,000 metric tons, the maximum exportable amount is 450,000 metric tons.

If all are exported, calculated at the current market price of ten yuan per jin, 9 billion circulating coupons can flow in. Therefore, promoting soybean exports is the most important and urgent task today, which is closely related to the economic prosperity of the Northeast.

In fact, exporting soybeans is not a difficult task, but the difficulty lies in the fact that 450,000 metric tons of soybeans are not easy to transport out, because the current price will hinder production, and the other is the difficulty of transportation. At the same time, the Northeast originally had a trade surplus, so there should be some concerns. However, regardless of whether there is a trade surplus inside and outside the customs, looking at the current situation, this amount can always help the construction of industry and agriculture in the Northeast, so the development of trade in the Northeast is the bridge to the construction of the Northeast.

The Japanese built the Northeast mostly with the Northeast's own money, which can be verified by figures. Among them, 60-70% of the construction funds relied on the Northeast's export trade, and on average, more than 80% relied on internal funds in the Northeast, so the Northeast's export trade itself is great and the foundation is very solid.

Supporting Trade

Cao Liying, Deputy Director of the Northeast Office of the Resources Committee, said: The current economy of the Northeast is like a "half-dead horse," in a state of half-life and half-death. As long as the export figures are sufficient, the trade business in the Northeast can naturally develop normally. Japan always had a trade surplus when implementing the trade control policy in the Northeast. In its composition, the proportion of industry and mining increased year by year compared to agricultural products. Therefore, in the era of Japanese control, the proportion of industry and mining was getting higher and higher, and now the production quantity of agricultural products is large, while the quantity of industrial and mining products is negligible. Therefore, we should consider the export priority order. (To be continued)

### The Current State of World Cotton Fabric Panic

— Rhyme Translation

Although many countries in the world have surplus cotton, cotton fabric weaving is still a crucial issue at present.

Although this year has passed, the panic over cotton fabric clothing in the world will still carry over from this year to next year in many countries. Looking at the global situation as a whole, there is no sign that this shortage will end.

Of course, the situation will eventually improve. However, regardless of the surplus of cotton in the United States and other countries now, the supply of shirts, casual wear, work clothes, and robes will continue to be scarce. Increasing the production of cotton fabrics is the most crucial issue at present.

The cotton textile industries of various countries in the world are now increasing production, but due to the lack of labor and coal, the scarcity of machines, and various economic dislocations caused by the war, the full recovery of productivity has been slow to achieve.

Before the war, Japan's cotton textile exports accounted for 40% of the world's total. The fact that the Allied countries have been unable to reach an agreement on how to deal with the country's textile industry for a long time is one of the factors that have created the world cotton fabric panic. Although the recovery efforts within Germany and Japan have been greatly delayed by various disputes, they are still continuing to restore the production of the textile industry to supply the newly liberated countries of Europe and Asia. However, as of November 1946, neither country has been able to export products.

Lack of Situation

The degree of cotton textile shortages varies from place to place around the world. In the United Kingdom, the rationing system is still strictly enforced, and the average Briton can only buy half of what he bought before the war. The situation in France is much worse than in the United Kingdom. As for other countries in Europe, the shortage has reached the point where housewives are even cutting up bed sheets, curtains, and tablecloths to make clothes to replace their tattered old outfits.

The situation in Latin American countries is relatively better, and these countries' cotton textile imports have increased by 50% compared to before the war. The consumption of cotton textiles in the United States has also returned to pre-war levels. Stimulated by factors such as full employment, increased income, and the demobilization of soldiers, the consumption of cotton textiles in the United States has increased by at least 50% compared to before the war.

The 170 million people in Southeast Asia are most severely oppressed by the clothing panic. They can only get a quarter of the cotton fabric they need. Therefore, they even refuse to work unless they are paid in clothing. The production of raw materials such as rubber, tin, copra, sugar, ramie, and oils, which are extremely important for the industrial recovery of Western countries, is indirectly affected. The production of rice urgently needed in the famine areas of China and India has also decreased as a result.

Looking at the current situation in the world, excluding the United States and former Axis countries, the average amount of cotton textiles that countries can obtain is only three-quarters of what it was before the war.

Production Increase Plan

Countries that already produce cotton fabrics are planning to distribute existing products evenly to areas in the world that are feeling the shortage through the Textile Construction Committee, which was formed during the war. The total amount of cotton textile exports from various countries in the world in the first half of this year was about 100 million yards, which is nearly one-third less than the pre-war level. Among them, the United States, which has the largest export volume in the world today, accounts for 400 million yards, accounting for a quarter of the country's total production.

The United Kingdom exported 250 million yards, accounting for 30% of its total exports. Other cotton textile exporting countries include India, Brazil, Mexico, and Canada.

At present, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries have begun to export cotton textiles. Some officials in the United States believe that the products of the above countries, coupled with the products supplied by the United States to Germany and Japan for manufacturing, can supply a total of 2 billion yards to countries in urgent need of cotton fabrics in the first half of 1947.

Many Difficulties

However, the obstacles in front of this 2 billion yard cotton fabric production increase plan are very large. Japan, which is expected to supply 500 million yards of fabric (this number is about 40% of the country's pre-war cotton fabric exports), is still in the early stages of its domestic cotton textile industry's recovery. The export volume in August 1946 was only 17 million yards, and the lack of food and coal is likely to reduce its export volume to less than half of what we expected.

The cotton textile industry in Europe is also facing a very serious shortage of labor and coal, and it will inevitably be very difficult to increase production as a result.

Moreover, the implementation of political pressure by various European countries and the United States will inevitably lead to the large-scale cotton fabrics being used for domestic consumption, even if the increase in cotton fabric production can be achieved as planned. If price controls in the United States are lifted, its export volume will be greatly reduced, and the International Textile Construction Committee will be on the verge of bankruptcy as a result. Under such circumstances, international trade competition will inevitably replace the principle of distribution based on needs. Under the principle of free trade, countries that are already wearing beautiful clothes, such as the United States and Latin American countries, are in the most advantageous position because they have money. The countries in Europe and Asia that have been liberated from the hands of the enemy will be able to obtain even less cotton fabric than they do now.

Future Prospects

Based on the above situation, a trend is already obvious: If the international distribution system is indeed abolished next year, the supply of cotton fabrics in a few countries will indeed improve, but the situation in areas where cotton fabrics are most urgently needed will be even more unimaginable.

Conversely, if the planned total of 2 billion yards of cotton fabrics from various countries in the world can be achieved as scheduled, and the distribution system can be maintained at the same time, then the total amount of cotton fabrics needed by countries feeling the clothing panic in the world, 225 million yards, can be fully supplied in the second half of 1947.

However, even if this situation is achieved, the complete end of the cotton textile panic is still far away. The total export volume of cotton fabrics from various cotton-producing countries must be increased to 325 million yards every six months to be comparable to the pre-war level. And in recent years, the needs of various countries in the world have certainly increased greatly.

Our conclusion is that unless a serious economic depression strikes and greatly reduces people's purchasing power, the shelves stacked with cotton fabrics in some areas of the world will remain empty for a long period of time in the future.

### Ministry of Education Prepares to Revise Regulations for the Establishment of Private Middle Schools to Increase Funds and Prevent Malpractices

(Reported from Nanjing on the 5th by this newspaper) The establishment of a private middle school should first organize a board of directors and submit an application for establishment. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education revised the pre-war regulations for private middle schools. First, regarding assets (such as school buildings and equipment), there must be actual buildings and equipment. Second, regarding funds, the Ministry of Education stipulated that the funds should be deposited in a bank to generate interest, which is sufficient to maintain the school's operating expenses in principle. Due to different prices in different regions, it was not possible to stipulate a uniform standard amount. However, educational bureaus in each province and city were ordered to stipulate a standard amount based on the actual situation of the local area and report it to the Ministry of Education for record. Recently, the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau stipulated that the minimum fund for a private junior middle school is 20 million yuan, and the amount for a senior middle school will be appropriately increased. The situation in other provinces and cities is very inconsistent. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is preparing to revise the regulations for the establishment of private middle schools this year. In order to prevent malpractices, the fund item will be increased.

### The Distribution Method of Educational Recovery Funds in the Northeast Has Been Determined

(Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th) The 500 million yuan in circulating coupons for Northeast Educational Recovery Funds, which had been approved by the Executive Yuan, has been discussed by all relevant parties in the education sector here. It has been decided that, according to the instructions from the Ministry of Education, one-tenth of the total amount, or 50 million yuan, will be reserved for emergency reconstruction when provinces and cities in the unrecovered areas are taken over. Of the remaining 450 million yuan, Liaoning will receive 150 million yuan, Jilin 85 million yuan, Andong and Liaobei 70 million yuan each, Shenyang 60 million yuan, Changchun 30 million yuan, and Siping, Jilin, and Andong cities 15 million yuan each, and Songjiang and Linzhong 5 million yuan. In addition, the Northeast Headquarters decided to temporarily issue 70% of the allocated funds before the Ministry of Education has approved the figures.

### Personnel Who Passed the Higher Examination Are Allowed to Be Sent Abroad for Observation

The Executive Yuan's reply to the Examination Yuan has been implemented by order.

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th) The "Measures for the Executive Yuan's Ministries, Departments, and Provincial and Municipal Governments to Send Personnel Abroad for Observation or Internship" promulgated by the Executive Yuan stipulates that personnel for observation or internship must be graduates of specialized schools or above, and the qualifications of those who passed the higher examination are not included. The Examination Yuan believes that personnel who passed the higher examination have always been strictly selected according to the level of university graduates, and their knowledge is above that of university graduates. The national government promulgated the Regulations on the Selection and Sending of Civil Servants for Further Study and Observation, stipulating that the selection of personnel is limited to those who have passed the higher examination or graduated from specialized schools or above at home and abroad. In addition, the public-funded and self-funded study abroad examinations, and the dispatch of agricultural, industrial, and mining technicians for overseas internships last year, have all been evaluated and participated by personnel who passed the higher examination. After consultation with the Executive Yuan, before the aforementioned measures are revised, personnel who have passed the higher examination and meet other conditions are allowed to be sent abroad for observation or internship, and they are requested to add the qualifications of those who have passed the higher examination when revising the measures. The Executive Yuan has now replied to do so and has been ordered to implement it.

### The Ministry of Education Will Select Geological Researchers to Be Sent Abroad

(Aviation News from Nanjing by this newspaper) Geologist Li Siguang recently received a letter from Professor Goldschmidt, hoping that our country would send three students (one each in physics, chemistry, and geology) to the practical training room he runs. However, all three must have done preliminary research work, and one of them must fully understand and be able to speak English or French. Mr. Li has forwarded this intention to the Ministry of Education. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has sent a letter to the Academia Sinica to recommend more than twice the number of candidates and submit research reports in order to determine the candidates.

### The Shenyang Municipal Government Trains Teachers of National Schools

### Refugee Students Cannot Afford Tuition Fees and Are Petitioning the Ministry of Education Today

(Reported by this newspaper) The Shanghai Refugee Student Association, in view of the fact that tuition fees for private colleges and universities in the next semester will be as high as 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, which is really unbearable, has specially sent representatives Yang Hanxun, Yang Peilin, and Qin Bangnan to Beijing today (6th) to petition the Ministry of Education, putting forward three specific requirements: (1) Please exempt refugee students from tuition fees in various colleges and universities in accordance with the clear order of the Ministry of Education. (2) Please quickly issue public funds to refugee students in various private colleges and universities in accordance with the order of the Ministry. (3) Please the Ministry of Education solve the accommodation problem for refugee students. The association also entertained the press yesterday (5th) afternoon, explaining that the hometowns of refugee students in various colleges and universities are mostly in civil war areas, and the source of income is difficult. If the authorities sit idly by and do not provide relief, more than a thousand people will lose their studies and become homeless. According to the association, there are students from Henan and Shandong, and the most are from northern Jiangsu.

### There Is a Surplus of High School Teachers in One District of Shanghai, According to Counselor Dan Yin of the Ministry of Education

Dan Yinmou, Counselor of the Ministry of Education, was previously sent to Shanghai to inspect various specialized schools and above. The inspection period has now ended. According to Mr. Dan, at a time when the whole country feels a shortage of teachers, the Shanghai area is an exception. Not only does it not feel a lack, but it also feels a surplus. For example, Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Daxia University, and others who have been reinstated have moved from the mainland to Shanghai, and the number of people has increased sharply, especially Jiaotong University, where the number of teachers exceeds the budget by 135 people.

### The Municipal Education Bureau Held a New Year's Talk Yesterday, Attended by More Than Ninety Middle School Principals

(Reported by this newspaper) The Municipal Education Bureau convened the principals of public and private middle schools in the city at the Municipal Gezhi Middle School at 3 pm yesterday to hold a New Year's Talk. More than ninety people, including Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Jizhou, Gao Erbai, Jin Zhaojun, and Xu Wenxiang, attended. Director Gu Yuxiu and Deputy Director Li Ximou personally presided over the meeting. First, Director Gu gave a speech, briefly saying: The salaries of public employees have been ordered to be adjusted, and the treatment of teachers in public and private schools is close.

Efforts Are Made to Suppress the Fees of Private Schools

Regarding the funding of private schools, Director Gu said: The Education Bureau does not intend to impose rigid restrictions for the time being, but hopes that each school will make efforts to suppress it as much as possible, and it is best not to increase it. Director Gu also said: When the council decides on the fee standard, it is best to allow each school to have temporary remedial measures in case of particularly high price increases. However, the number of free places in each school must be increased to at least 20% of the total number of students in the school. If the number of students applying is less than this percentage, and the school can use the remaining tuition fees to add books and instruments, the Education Bureau can also allow it. Director Gu said that the new constitution stipulates that educational funding should not be less than 15% of the total budget at the central level, not less than 25% at the provincial level, and not less than 35% at the city and county level. He believes that such regulations are unprecedented in the constitutions of various countries in the world, which shows the importance our country attaches to education. The educational sector has a promising future and hopes that people in the educational sector will work together to promote its realization.

The University Strike Has Come to an End

As for the recent universities protesting the atrocities of the US military in Peiping, Director Gu emphasized that the remarks of Peking University President Hu Shi on this incident were the most appropriate, because the atrocities of one or two US soldiers are purely a legal issue and should not involve political issues. At the same time, they are also moral issues of individual behavior and cannot be blamed on the collective. Middle school students have their own correct understanding. At the end of the semester, middle school students should work harder on their own studies and avoid propaganda. He hopes to make rational judgments. After Director Gu finished his speech, Deputy Director Li continued to speak, saying: Universities such as Fudan and Tongji, which protested the atrocities of the US military in Peiping by striking, have resumed classes one after another. Jiaotong University will also officially start class today (5th), so this matter has come to an end.

The Bureau Will Reimburse Free Places Exceeding the Quota

Regarding the issue of tuition fees for private schools, Deputy Director Li also said: In the last semester, it was stipulated that elementary schools should charge 80,000 yuan, junior middle schools 120,000 yuan, and senior middle schools 160,000 yuan. It was also stipulated that 20% of the total number of students should be free, 25% for school recurring expenses, and the rest for teachers' salaries. However, many private schools did not follow the 20% free quota. In the next semester, it is hoped that each school will increase the number of free places as much as possible, so as not to cause any student to lose their studies due to increased tuition fees. If the number of applicants for free places exceeds 20%, the excess number will be reimbursed by the Education Bureau. Free places for children of civil servants are also hoped to be implemented seriously. In addition to the 20% full exemption resolved by the City Council, another 10% half exemption is required, and it is hoped that this will be gradually achieved in the future. After Deputy Director Li finished speaking, Director Gu asked the principals of each school present to freely express their opinions, and the meeting did not end until after 5 pm.

### One Powerful Kick Determines the Landscape – Donghua Defeats Qingbai Again Yesterday – Six Wins in Six Games, Championship in Sight

In the second round of the Group A Football League, Donghua met Qingbai again. Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and at 2:30 PM, the match proceeded as usual at Yiyuan. Fans flocked to the stadium, filling it to capacity, with an estimated crowd of over ten thousand people, marking a grand occasion for the new year. In a fierce contest, Donghua, thanks to Sun Tie-tui's free kick in the opening three minutes, scored a precious goal to defeat Qingbai again. This secured a glorious record of six wins in six games. The starting lineups for both sides yesterday are recorded as follows:

Donghua

Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen

Han Longbo, Fu Zhen, Yu Zhixing

Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Tie Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang

Qingbai

Qin Bigao

Yan Shi, Wu Qixiang

Huang Zhendong, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng

Zhang Renyi, Li Yichen, Gu Yisha, Song Lingsheng, Jiang Qing

Donghua Breaks the Net Within Three Minutes

The match started on time, with referee Wu Shouheng and linesmen Chen Jixiang and Huang Renyi. Donghua kicked off, with all five forwards advancing. Meng Yiliang, eager to protect, handled the ball outside the twenty-yard box, resulting in a free kick for Ah Sun. With a powerful kick, the ball flew like an arrow, straight into the right corner. Qin Bigao was unable to save it. Donghua scored the opening goal, only three minutes into the game, prompting a continuous barrage of firecrackers from the crowd. Four minutes later, Zhang Lingen violently tackled Gu Yisha outside the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick for Qingbai. Yi Chen took the shot, but Lingen redeemed himself by clearing the ball with a header.

Qingbai's Counterattack Achieves Nothing

Qingbai's counterattack was fierce, but achieved nothing. Donghua attacked again. He Dai advanced down the center and made a brilliant pass to Longhai. Little Han dribbled deep and shot near the goal, but Bigao managed to catch the ball securely. Soon after, Shi Xin also committed a handball, and Youliang took a long shot, which Bigao pushed away, averting danger. Eighteen minutes into the game, Zhang Lingen and Renyi collided, and Lingen was injured and left the field, but soon returned. Around the twentieth minute, Ah Sun received a pass from the back, turned, and attempted an overhead kick. The stance was beautiful, but Bigao jumped up and caught it. Qingbai launched an all-out attack. Little Gu made a central breakthrough and shot over the crossbar. Thirty-nine minutes into the game, Qingbai's Huang Zhendong touched the ball with his hand outside the penalty area, resulting in a free kick. Ah Sun planned to repeat the old trick, taking a powerful shot. The ball was low and fast, heading straight for the goal, but Yan Shixin cleared the danger at the goal line. At the end of the first half, Donghua led by one goal.

No Gains in the Second Half

In the second half, both sides maintained the same lineups. Qingbai's Gao Baozheng committed a handball, and Ah Sun took three free kicks outside the penalty area. He selected Li Yao, who shot immediately, but Bigao caught the ball. Qingbai launched a counterattack, fierce in its approach, but all efforts were in vain. Twenty-one minutes in, Zhang Renyi lofted the ball in front of the goal, but Banglun reacted quickly and cleared the danger. Donghua launched an offensive, with Sun Tie-tui taking two shots, both flying over the crossbar. Ah Zai received a pass from Li Yao, jumped up, and headed the ball, but Bigao caught it again. Thirty-six minutes in, Qingbai's Gu Yisha and Jiang Qing charged forward, heading straight into the penalty area. Fortunately, Donghua's Zhuang Youren rushed back and saved the day. Afterwards, Qingbai's Jiang Qing left the field due to an injury. Forty-two minutes in, Ah Zhuang, overzealous, was also injured, leaving both sides with ten players. Shortly after, the game ended, with Donghua defeating Qingbai again by a score of 1-0.

### Correction from Reader

Upon investigation, the Ministry of Education of our country is preparing to establish a popular library in Japan because the people of Japan urgently hope to understand the progress of all cultural and academic endeavors in our country since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, as well as the situation in various aspects of politics, economy, and society. The Ministry of Education, in view of the fact that the United States has already established an American popular library in the central district of Tokyo, which is exclusively for the use of the Japanese people and has been well received, and that the Soviet Union also has organizations such as the Soviet-Japanese Cultural Association to provide introductions, is considering establishing a Chinese popular library in Tokyo at the request of the Japanese people, in order to promote the spirit of resistance and cultural and academic progress of our country since the September 18th Incident, and to influence the thinking of the Japanese people. All books, magazines, etc. will be purchased and sent from within the country or donated by various academic institutions, rather than taken from our country's old books and antiques that were looted in the past and should now be returned to us. The news from Tokyo reported in your newspaper on December 6th has slight factual discrepancies. I hope you will make a correction.

Respectfully,

Zhang Fengju

### Outside Perimeter of Lushun and Dalian

— This Newspaper's New Year's Day Airmail News from Shenyang, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Northeast China, Han Qingqing

On the eve of the government taking over Lushun and Dalian, and at a time when newspapers around the world are prominently reporting on Lushun and Dalian, it has aroused great attention and interest among the Chinese people. This is because the National Army is currently only active on the fringes of Dalian. At the same time, the entire past development of Lushun and Dalian is linked to the so-called "Kwantung Leased Territory" area. Today, it is necessary to introduce to everyone the political, economic, and construction situation of the enemy's "Kwantung Leased Territory," which is the actual outline of the core and surrounding areas of Lushun and Dalian.

This area is the tentacle of the Far Eastern Peninsula, standing on the tip of the southern end of the peninsula, with the Yellow Sea to the east and the Bohai Sea to the west. The tentacle extends to the center. Its scope includes the area from the vicinity of Chaoyang Temple north of Pulandian to the Biluo River area east of Piziwo, forming a line. All areas south of this line and nearby islands belong to it, totaling 3,462 square kilometers, forming the enemy's entry and exit point, its lifeline.

In this special area, there are undulating hills, a lack of flat land, and narrow river basins, without the convenience of water transportation. Along the Yellow Sea coast, there are many curved coastlines, with natural harbors like Dalian and Lushun. The wide and flat sandy beaches along the coast are suitable for salt production. The main islands include Wuyu and the Changshan Islands.

General Climate

The tentacle area is dominated by a maritime climate due to its terrain. At the same time, because it is close to the mainland, it is also affected by the continental climate. Winter lasts for about half a year, from November to April of the following year. Summer is also relatively long, often with a tendency to transition directly from winter to summer.

Near May, the heat is felt. From July to mid-August, it reaches its peak, but the temperature decreases in the morning and evening, and there is usually no suffering from the heat. In mid-September, the temperature drops, and the autumn scenery fills the sky. By November, everything presents a winter scene, and it is time for life around the stove.

July and August can be considered the rainy season, with rainfall accounting for half of the annual total. However, there are very few sudden rains and strong winds, with many sunny days and many hours of sunshine. There are few days with snowfall and snow accumulation. In addition, in the spring, there are continental cyclones that stir up sand and dust into the sky, forming a yellow dust phenomenon, which dims the sunlight and is an unpleasant time!

Administrative System

In the past, the administrative organization of the "Kwantung Leased Territory" consisted of the "Kwantung Bureau" and the "Kwantung Leased Territory Government." The bureau was located in the Japanese embassy in the puppet Manchukuo, and the office was located in Dalian City. The head of the Kwantung Bureau was the plenipotentiary ambassador to the puppet Manchukuo, supervised by the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, and handled the affairs of the Kwantung Bureau. The governor of the "Kwantung Leased Territory Government" was under the command of the Japanese ambassador and managed the administrative affairs of the Kwantung Leased Territory. According to his authority or special delegation, he had the power to issue orders to the commander of the army and navy and to request the use of military force.

The local autonomy system of the "Kwantung Leased Territory" was divided into two types: "city system" and "association system." The administrative districts within the territory were divided into two cities and sixty-four associations. Except for the city areas of Dalian and Lushun, the association system was implemented in all other areas. These were divided into four districts: Jinzhou, Pulandian, Piziwo, and Lushun. Each district had a civil affairs office, and the number of associations under its jurisdiction varied depending on the scope of the civil affairs office, with ten in Lushun, sixteen in Jinzhou, eighteen in Pulandian, and twenty in Piziwo.

Lushun and Dalian Shipping

Although the history of shipping in Lushun and Dalian is not long, the development of Japanese fleets within the territory has been truly astonishing. The external transportation of Lushun and Dalian took a turning point in 1906 when Dalian Port was converted into a free trade port. Because Dalian Port was used as an auxiliary port to Lushun, it handled the trade of special products of the puppet Manchukuo. At the same time, the South Manchuria Railway Company's management of the docks was successful, not only connecting with the Japanese mainland, Taiwan, the Chinese coast, and Southeast Asia, but also with Australia, India, Europe, and North America. After the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo, in order to develop resources, various industries flourished, and ship traffic reached its peak. However, it was later greatly influenced by ships from Britain, France, and Germany. After the establishment of the Dalian Steamship Company, a special unit of the South Manchuria Railway, in 1915, it became the third largest fleet in Japan. With the increase in other ships in the "Kwantung Leased Territory," it gained an important position in East Asian maritime transport.

During the September 18th Incident and the Pacific War, foreign commercial companies gradually withdrew, and Japanese commercial companies concentrated and merged. Many also closed down and went out of business. In the end, the only commercial companies remaining in Dalian were D汽, 東亞, 油船, 山下, and 三井, in addition to the Manchuria Shipping Company.

When Soviet troops reached the outer perimeter and core of Lushun and Dalian, there were fewer Japanese ships in Dalian Bay, except for a few Soviet ships and some wooden boats used by the Communist army. Very few other ships came and went.

Commercial and Industrial Prospects

In the past, commerce in Lushun and Dalian and its surroundings was subject to extreme control. The people's daily necessities were entirely handled by Japanese-Manchu commercial companies, fiber companies, fruit companies, and fisheries companies. In addition, under the Trade Federation of the Puppet Manchukuo and Kwantung Leased Territory, thirty-nine industrial cooperatives were established to handle allocation.

In order to assist the government in implementing its economic policies, the Japanese, in addition to the commercial and industrial sectors, also included agriculture and fisheries. In Dalian, Lushun, Jinzhou, and other places, they established the "Kwantung Leased Territory Economic Association," a joint organization of various groups, with more than 2,400 members.

Currently, all commercial organizations have changed in nature. Some are managed entirely by the Soviet Union, and some are engaged in distorted commercial operations in the hands of the Communist army.

Industry occupies an important position in the economic sphere. The development of industry in this region was due to the establishment of the Shahekou Factory by the South Manchuria Railway Company, or the formation of several component parts factories that were established along with it. The important factories include Dalian Shipyard, Dalian Machinery, Manhua, Mancao, Manshi, and the last to be established, Manzhou Heavy Machinery, Sanmeng, Marconi, etc. By 1941, Dalian had 1,043 factories with five or more employees, Lushun had 122 factories, Jinzhou had 147 factories, Pulandian had 38 factories, and Piziwo had 22 factories, totaling 1,372 factories, with an investment of over 558.8 million Manchukuo yuan and a production value of over 490 million yuan.

In May 1942, the "Kwantung Leased Territory Industrial Association" was established. The main tasks of the association were to conduct surveys and research on the same industry, allocate materials to member factories, and train technical personnel for self-sufficient farms. Members included those with an investment of over 500,000 yuan or "associations" recognized by the labor union, including textile industry, metal machinery industry, chemical industry, oil and fat industry, kiln industry, food industry, electricity and gas, etc.

Profits from Fishing and Salt

The fishing industry is also an important industry. At the same time, the "Kwantung Leased Territory" is also the only aquatic product of the Northeast because the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea on both sides of the Far Eastern Peninsula produce abundant species such as mackerel, crucian carp, horse mackerel, 鯔, yellow croaker, sea bream, hairtail, bass, and shrimp.

In 1926, the "Kwantung Leased Territory Fisheries Association" was established for the purpose of improving and developing the fishing industry. An office was set up within the Kwantung Leased Territory Government, and branches were established in Dalian, Lushun, Jinzhou, Pulandian, and Piziwo. Members included 380 Japanese and 5,250 Chinese. The main businesses of the association were to open fish markets in Dalian and Lushun, and to engage in market research on aquatic products, or fisheries protection and management. In 1939, it was reorganized into Kwantung Leased Territory Fisheries Promotion Company.

A fisheries experiment station was established in Tiger Beach. The business it handles includes experiments or surveys related to aquatic products, as well as analysis or identification of aquatic products. In addition, there is a fisheries training institute, which focuses on training fisheries cadres.

This area has low rainfall, strong evaporation, and a dry atmosphere, making it most suitable for salt production. In the past, it was a famous salt-producing area along with Taiwan and Qingdao. When the Japanese began to rule, only a few Chinese had salt fields, and the rest were operated by the Japanese. Salt fields were located in Piziwo, Dengshahe, Pulandian, Jinzhou, Jiaxinzi, Shihe, Lushun and other places. Most of the salt produced was transported to the Japanese mainland and Korea. The uses of salt produced in various places in Piziwo include salt for the chemical industry, washing salt, and edible salt. Recently, it can be used to produce aluminum for aviation from 滷水, so the 滷水 industry has great prospects for development. The Japanese then established the "Kwantung Leased Territory 滷水 Chemical Factory" in Pulandian, and the "Kwantung Leased Territory Potassium Industrial Factory" in Jiaxinzi, both of which produce a lot of solid 滷水, most of which is supplied to the chemical industry in Korea.

In 1933, the Kwantung Leased Territory Salt Industry Experiment Station was established in Dafangshen, and a branch was established in Lushun. Later, due to the development of the brine industry, an experimental factory was also established to conduct salt-making experiments and surveys, salt-making research and analysis, and brine utilization experiments and research.

Farmland and Minerals

The food produced in the core and surrounding areas of Lushun and Dalian is not enough to meet the local needs, and a large amount must be supplied from southern and northern Liaoning every year. The main grains produced are corn, followed by peanuts, sorghum, and chestnuts. The most common vegetables are Chinese cabbage, radishes, and melons.

The climate and soil in this area are most suitable for growing fruit trees. Early-producing pears, apricots, hawthorns, etc., were grown after 1906. Apples, grapes, or cherries have become excellent, especially apples, which are now widely cultivated.

An agricultural experiment station is located outside the East Gate of Jinzhou, divided into departments for agronomy, fruit trees, vegetables, agronomy, chemistry, insects, and sericulture. In order to improve the quality of important export agricultural products, a special export agricultural product inspection office was established, which has achieved great success in terms of export reputation.

Although there are no large-scale mineral deposits in the outer perimeter of Lushun and Dalian, the mining industry is very developed. Currently, about ten kinds of minerals are mined, including dolomite, asbestos, gold, iron, coal, barite, fluorite, manganese, emery, and vanadium ore.

Dolomite is abundant and of good quality. Most of the minerals are transported to the Japanese mainland, and the rest are consumed in the Anshan Iron and Steel Works and the Shanyuan Micro-Powder Fish Feed Factory in Dalian. Dolomite is mostly used as refractory material for high-temperature furnaces in ironmaking, 結合劑 in glass, and high-grade coatings for general civil engineering construction.

Asbestos is produced in Shangshan, Jinzhou, and barite and fluorite are produced in Pulandian. Other minerals are distributed in various places.

In the past, the "Kwantung Leased Territory" was a specialized area, with beauty and ugliness. On the one hand, it was civilization and enlightenment, and on the other hand, it was oppression and barbarism. The Japanese had a good time, and the compatriots suffered cruel treatment. Just take the Japanese police as an example, the compatriots seemed like mice seeing cats. Today, the term "Kwantung Leased Territory" no longer exists, the demonic shadow has disappeared, the entire area has been restored to the territory of China, and it only depends on how we use it and how we develop it!

### Taiwan Rubber Factory

— Taipei Airmail News on the 19th, Correspondent of This Newspaper in Taiwan, Yang Yu

The rubber industry, which is deeply and significantly related to national defense and people's livelihood, has not had a planned large factory in Taiwan because rubber trees are not suitable for planting. There are only some sporadic small-scale manufacturing plants. Until after the Second World War, Japan was threatened by the interruption of sea transportation and felt the danger that the rubber industry could not catch up quickly. Therefore, it merged many small manufacturing plants in Taiwan Province into a unified "Taiwan 橡膠株式會社" in 1941. It started large-scale construction between Songshan and Nangang in the suburbs of Taipei City, improved equipment, expanded its scale, and implemented a monopoly policy to supply military shoes, bicycle tires, aircraft tires, etc., during the war. At the same time, this company also had a high degree of performance in manufacturing all accessories equipped on various agricultural, industrial, and mining machines. At the end of the war, it also built a factory to manufacture automobile and truck tires. All the machines had been assembled, but the atomic bomb finally forced the invaders to abandon many large factories like this that they were reluctant to let go of.

Overcoming Difficulties and Producing More Than Three Million

On April 17, 1946, the Taiwan Provincial Department of Industry and Mining officially took over this company and renamed it "Taiwan Rubber Factory," which was affiliated with the Chemical Products Company. According to Director Shen Yunjie, the working capital taken over from the Japanese at that time was more than 700,000 Taiwan dollars. The depreciated value of finished products and semi-finished products in stock was also nearly 9.5 million Taiwan dollars. The estimated value of other houses, land, and machines was about 20 million Taiwan dollars. However, the most difficult thing was the raw materials in the factory because the ocean was blocked at the beginning, and the number of old inventories was very small. At the same time, many machines were scattered everywhere to avoid Allied bombing, and the factory was dilapidated with incomplete doors and windows. But it has become our own thing, and it cannot be stopped for a moment on the road of reconstruction after the recovery! After the supervision of the superiors and the concerted efforts of the subordinates, we finally overcame this difficulty and worked hard for several months. In the months of September, October, and November, the production figures were slightly reduced due to the reorganization relationship. But by December, the production figures for the first half of the month alone exceeded 3 million Taiwan dollars, and it is estimated that the whole month will be more than 7 million Taiwan dollars.

Shoe Manufacturing Speed Is Amazing

The reporter was led by Mr. Xie Qiyuan of the factory's technical department to visit several parts of the factory: The roller factory is for pressing preliminary ingredients and recycled rubber products. The whole piece of rubber, together with many necessary sulfur, softening agents, fillers, anti-aging agents, etc., are poured in between two smooth large rollers, kneading like making noodles, gradually becoming soft, and mixing with the medicine to form a black sheet of skin. It takes about half an hour to complete the preliminary raw rubber, and then it is taken out and pressed into thick and thin rubber sheets and many applied patterns with a flattening machine when it is to be used. Manufacturing recycled rubber is the work of waste utilization. The broken rubber that has been "vulcanized" is ground into powder in a machine, and then a softening agent is added and heated to high temperature to take out the rubber mixed in the raw rubber. The machine equipment in this part includes seven roller machines, one crushing roller, one grinder, five glazing machines, one drum dryer, two vulcanizers, six rubber paste mixers, seven cutting machines, and six press speed machines. Now most of them are in full operation.

The first factory is a factory that manufactures various types of shoes such as men's and women's long and short rain boots, sneakers, and underground socks (Japanese-style shoes with two toes separated). 251 sewing machines continuously tread the cloth taken from the cutting machine into the shape of shoes, and the female workers apply glue and attach the soles. Because rain boots are all made of rubber, the procedure is more complicated, but on average, a pair can be glued together in 15 minutes. There are 978 pairs of raw aluminum shoe molds for underground socks, 3,835 pairs of sneakers, 1,892 pairs of full rubber short shoes, 389 pairs of long boots, 3,538 pairs of front round soles, and 2,000 pairs of rain boots, but the appearance is very old. Now, in addition to having newly made many models of women's long boots, it will continue to improve and add to them next year.

Most of the finished products have to go through the vulcanization (that is, heating) procedure. They are loaded into a vulcanizer with wooden frames and sprayed with high-temperature steam to make the rubber and sulfur undergo a chemical reaction and become durable. This direct vulcanization easily causes colored cloth to fade, and an indirect vulcanizer will be applied soon.

Rubber Hoses Can Be Supplied in Large Quantities

The second factory specializes in manufacturing rickshaw bicycle tires and water pipes. The machine equipment here is completely suitable for tubular production. During the war, the Japanese forced the people to buy fire hoses to avoid losses from bombing. Now, on average, each household has more than 40 feet of rubber pipes, so although it has the capacity of producing 2,000 feet per day, sales are sluggish. They all hope to accept orders from other provinces and use the business funds to expand the scope locally.

The third factory that manufactures automobile and truck tires is fully equipped, but it has not been able to start work because it lacks the thick Cord inside the outer tire.

Next year, the Rubber Factory has formulated a plan to produce 7,000 pairs of shoes, 33,765 feet of pipes, 1,588 feet of rollers, 520 tires, 13,000 feet of buffers, 600 automobile tires, and 5,600 bicycle tires per month, with a total value of more than 10 million Taiwan dollars. The production figures during the Japanese operation have not yet been found out, but according to Director Shen, because raw materials can be purchased from Southeast Asia, and sales will be promoted in the future, the estimated production volume for next year can at least exceed the past.

### On Local National Structure

— Ruan Yicheng

In this National Assembly, Chapter 11 of the draft constitution proposed by the National Government, originally titled "Provincial and County System," was renamed "Local System" by the Sixth Review Committee. This chapter can be said to be the most progressive chapter of this constitution compared to the "May Fifth Constitution," because it connects with the preceding Chapter 10, establishing the application of balanced local power. We know that this constitution has two basic principles regarding the organization of the state: decentralized central power and balanced local power, both of which are the legacy of the Founding Father. However, in the past, some people often viewed the decentralization of central power as a single power exercised by the president alone, and regarded the balanced local power as centralized power, with everything controlled by the central government. The establishment of the status of the local system in the constitution is of great importance to the future of national construction.

Since the period of political tutelage, the work of local autonomy has never been completed. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the National Government promulgated the "Outline of Organizations at All Levels of Counties" in the 29th year of the Republic (1940), known as the New County System, which integrated the baojia system with autonomy and emphasized both undertakings and organization. This could have been a good opportunity to promote local autonomy. However: (1) the New County System never went through legislative procedures, and the County Autonomy Law was never formulated by the Legislative Yuan; (2) the central government assigned national administrative matters such as conscription and grain collection to local autonomous bodies, and required local areas to bear the expenses; (3) various local autonomous undertakings were under the management of several unrelated agencies in the central government and provinces, resulting in inconsistent laws and regulations, disjointed plans, subjective biases, and different evaluation standards; (4) the curriculum for cadre training was verbose and impractical, and it failed to align with the regular education system. Therefore, although the New County System stipulated that it should be completed within three years, only a part of the organization was completed, and the undertakings were far from complete. Especially after the War of Resistance against Japan, power had to be concentrated in the central government, and the status of provinces and counties declined, leading to the bankruptcy of provincial and county finances, the inability to improve the treatment of public and educational personnel, and the lack of funding for undertakings. Even minor matters had to be subject to central government orders or require instructions from the central government, which led to the central government focusing on achieving uniformity in form, while the local areas became inactive and unable to take action. Therefore, today, it is difficult for those responsible at the local level and the people to answer the question of why local autonomy has not been completed.

The purpose of the local system is to establish a systematic local autonomy system. In the new constitution, we can see that:

(A) The legal system of local autonomy is top-down. The autonomous status recognized by the constitution is explicitly stipulated in the constitution that the general principles of provincial and county autonomy are legislated and implemented by the central government, or delegated to the provinces and counties for implementation. The general principles of provincial and county autonomy are subsidiary laws to the constitution, but they are parent laws to the provincial and county autonomy laws. Since the general principles are legislated by the central government, the autonomy laws of each province and county cannot violate them in the future. In other words, the content can still be largely the same. Those who are worried about local areas formulating their own autonomy laws can rest assured that the autonomy systems of the provinces and counties will not differ too much. The constitution stipulates that the provincial people's representative assemblies formulate provincial autonomy laws based on the general principles of provincial and county autonomy. Therefore, from the perspective of the legal system of autonomy, it is still top-down and will not become a federal state.

(B) The content of the provincial and county autonomy laws still retains a lot of flexibility. The constitution only stipulates that there should be general principles of provincial and county autonomy, without detailing its content. The content of the provincial autonomy law only specifies three main items in the constitution, and the county autonomy law does not specify the content either. All of these leave flexibility for local legislation. Therefore, we hope that the central government will not be too verbose when formulating the general principles of provincial and county autonomy in the future, so that the provincial and county autonomy laws cannot adapt to local conditions. The relationship between provinces and counties, the organization of provincial and county governments, and the autonomous organizations and undertakings below the county level are not listed in the constitution, with the aim of reserving more flexibility for the provincial and county autonomy laws. It will not be like the present situation, where even the most detailed matters require the central government to exert effort.

(C) Provinces and counties all have representative assemblies and legislative power. The constitution stipulates that provincial and county people's representative assemblies formulate provincial and county autonomy laws. This is because before the new provincial and county assemblies are established, there should first be law-making bodies to formulate provincial and county autonomy laws. The provincial and county people's representative assemblies are not like the National Assembly and may not be permanent bodies. Whether the election and recall of provincial and county heads, the amendment of provincial and county autonomy laws, still need to be handled by convening provincial and county people's representative assemblies, or by the provincial and county assemblies, or by directly exercising the four powers by provincial and county citizens, can be stipulated by each province and county in its own provincial and county autonomy laws, without forcing uniformity among the provinces and counties. For example, today, county head elections have already been implemented in Xinjiang, but some counties have not yet been able to do so. This shows that uniformity is not necessary in order to adapt to local conditions. The constitution also stipulates that provincial and county assemblies exercise provincial and county legislative power, which is also very important. Because the balanced power advocated by the Founding Father is balanced administrative power and balanced affairs. The judicial, supervisory, and examination powers among the administrative powers should be unified under the central government and have a national unified nature. The administrative and legislative powers should be shared by the central government and the provinces and counties. Otherwise, the spirit of the balanced power system cannot be implemented. Therefore, the provincial and county people's representative assemblies exercise the political power to create provincial and county autonomy laws, while the provincial and county assemblies exercise the local legislative power belonging to administrative power. Both are necessary.

(D) In addition to stipulating matters that are legislated and implemented by the central government, and matters that are legislated by the central government and implemented by the provinces and counties, the constitution also stipulates matters that are legislated and implemented by the provinces and matters that are legislated and implemented by the counties. This is a three-level balanced power system. Listing the powers of the central government, provinces, and counties truly conforms to the principle of balanced power. The remaining powers of unlisted items will be attributed to the central government, provinces, or counties based on their nature in the future. In case of disputes, they will be resolved by the central Legislative Yuan elected by the people through universal suffrage. This fully expresses the Founding Father's balanced power system. Because the content of local autonomy does not lie in empty legal provisions that define it as an autonomous unit, but in determining the items of its autonomous affairs. Once the items are determined, the situation of mutual power struggles or mutual evasion of responsibility between the central government, provinces, and counties can be avoided. The expenses for an affair handled by the central government, a province, or a county will be borne by the central government, the province, or the county, which can also eliminate the disadvantages of the central government, provinces, and counties competing for profits or unequal rights and obligations. For many years, some people have advocated reducing the powers of the provinces, thinking that reducing the powers of the provinces would increase the powers of the counties. In fact, this is not the case. Given the large number of counties in our country, the vast differences in population, area, culture, and resources among the counties, and the fact that most counties are currently unable to be self-sufficient, if the powers of the provinces are reduced, the counties will not be able to bear their affairs. As a result, the central government will have to act on their behalf, which will invisibly increase the responsibilities and powers of the central government. This is detrimental to the provinces and does not benefit the counties. This is not what those who promote local autonomy want to see, but it is also something that they have not anticipated.

The foundation of constitutionalism lies in autonomy, and the root of democracy lies in the local areas. Now that the constitution has a local system that conforms to the legacy and the national conditions, it is hoped that all local areas in the country can make good use of this sound local system and lay the most solid cornerstone for the future of national construction.

### Freedom of Assembly and Association

— Huisheng

Article 14 of Chapter II of the Constitution of the Republic of China states: "The people have the freedom of assembly and association." This provision seems very ordinary and does not seem to have any problems. In fact, there are many problems now.

The problem does not arise because freedom is limited to the point where it cannot be enjoyed. On the contrary, it arises because some people enjoy freedom, which leads to the loss of freedom for others.

It is well known that lawyers and accountants cannot practice their professions without becoming members of their local associations. The current Trade Association Law and Labor Union Law also enforce compulsory membership. For example, Article 12 of Chapter III of the Labor Union Law stipulates: "All male and female workers who are 16 years of age or older in the area where the labor union is organized shall join the labor union of the same industry or profession they are engaged in." Article 12 of Chapter III of the Commercial Trade Association Law also stipulates that commercial companies and firms in the same region, whether publicly or privately operated, shall be members of the commercial trade association, except for publicly operated enterprises with seals or state-run businesses stipulated by law. Article 42 of Chapter VIII of the same law also stipulates: "Companies and firms that do not join the commercial trade association in accordance with this law... may be subject to the following penalties, depending on the circumstances: 1. Breach of contract fine; 2. Suspension of business for a period of time; 3. Permanent suspension of business." The Industrial Trade Association Law also has similar provisions. That is to say, these companies, firms, and factories must join the association to become members. In other words, these companies, firms, and factories have an obligation to join the association and do not have the freedom to choose whether or not to join. If it is confirmed that they have freedom, then joining is certainly acceptable, but not joining seems to be acceptable as well.

Because the current law stipulates that everyone must join in the positive aspect and stipulates various sanctions in the consumption aspect, people feel that assembly and association is an obligation, not a right. The word "freedom" seems somewhat out of place. Moreover, many disputes have already occurred in fact. Because some industrial and commercial elements are willing to give up their rights and unwilling to enjoy this compulsory freedom, those who handle association affairs have to take various actions to force them to join. They either persuade and urge them to join, or send many people to threaten them, or even ask the government to force them to join by order. These free-spirited individuals who are unwilling to join use various methods to evade and deal with the situation, trying to escape. As a result, many disputes over assembly and association have been created. As far as I can see, some associations even require foreign businesses to join across the board. However, according to Article 2 of the "Measures for Foreign Nationals to Organize Chambers of Commerce and Participate in Commercial Organizations," if there are fewer than five foreign businesses of the same nationality in the same county or city government's town, they may join the local trade association of their respective industry as members. It seems that there is still some freedom to choose whether or not to join, because the meaning of the word "may" is different from "must" and "shall." How these disputes should be resolved is beyond the scope of this article. What I want to study here is whether people have the freedom of assembly and association, and whether they also have the freedom not to assemble or associate. To extend this further, if the current law stipulates that there is no such freedom, then do these current laws conflict with the spirit of the constitution?

Some people think that Article 23 of the constitution states: "The freedoms and rights listed in the above articles may not be restricted by law, except to prevent obstruction of the freedom of others..." According to this provision, restricting freedom by law is not considered unconstitutional. They do not know that the meaning of this article is that in certain situations, the freedom of assembly and association of the people can be restricted by law. That is to say, when they should be able to assemble and associate, they are not allowed to assemble and associate. It is not that when they do not want to assemble and associate, they are forced to assemble and associate. If the freedom stipulated by the constitution must be forcibly enjoyed by the people, then this freedom is already an obligation, not freedom, and not a right. This article should be changed to "The people have the obligation to assemble and associate in accordance with the law," and be treated the same as paying taxes and serving in the military, or be changed to "The people have the right and obligation to assemble and associate," like compulsory education, in order to be coherent. Moreover, the freedoms of the people stipulated by the constitution, in addition to assembly and association, also include residence, migration, speech, lecturing, writing, publishing, secret communication, and freedom of religion. If assembly and association can be forced by law, they must believe in and speak about... According to the true meaning of freedom, I am afraid it is a bit inappropriate! According to Nanjing telegraphic news, the government has begun to review the current laws and plans to amend or revise those that conflict with the new constitution. Whether the above-mentioned laws restricting freedom should be amended seems worthy of review.

Some people believe that if a free membership system is adopted during the implementation of economic controls, it may increase the difficulty in promoting policies. This statement also has considerable reasons. However, what this article emphasizes is the freedom of the people, not the so-called control, and the spirit of the constitution, not the trivial means of control. This should be stated incidentally.

Vegetable Growth and Water Requirements

Illustration: The experiment conducted on vegetables growing in wetlands shows that as the amount of water gradually decreases from left to right, the growth also gradually slows down. Therefore, other plants can also use this method to measure the appropriate amount of water needed. (Yang Yu, reporter stationed in Taiwan for this newspaper)

### A Scam in the Henan Education Sector

— Kaifeng, December 23rd, Air Mail. Wang Shoumei, reporter stationed in Bian for this newspaper

There are many strange things in the Henan education sector. This semester started late, and elementary school students spent a lot of time taking classes in the courtyard. The young students who fled here do not want to move out of the schools, but no one cares about them—some agencies still claim to be working on youth movements and occupy the most enemy and puppet properties, but they do not allow them to be used for good deeds, but instead sing operas for a few days each week and open canteens! Wounded soldiers live in the schools, as if it should be so. Middle school students have been taking classes for a long time, but they have not done a single composition! Publicly funded students are not getting enough to eat, but no one cares. The students of Henan University are dissatisfied with their incompetent professors and feel a deep sense of emptiness and sadness, constantly calling on all parties to save them in the newspapers. The students in the schools are like this, but there are even more students outside the schools—it is difficult to get into school, let alone those who do not have the ability to study. In Kaifeng alone, there are about 220,000 elementary school-age children out of school. No one pays attention to these phenomena, and Henan education is originally backward. It is in these circumstances that a major scam occurred in Henan—this is also a major strange thing and miracle in the Henan education sector.

Donating a School to Swindle Money

In a situation where many young people are out of school, Henan produced a correspondence college, whose president, Jing Zhongtian, is "a native of Deng County, Henan, who is 30 years old, unmarried, frank, honest, enthusiastic, hardworking, and responsible." His friend and also his major assistant, Hao Guanru, introduced him to society in this way after the scam was exposed and called him the "Wu Xun" of Henan. However, some people said that he was a "kid" and a "big swindler." Speaking matter-of-factly, he is not Mr. Wu Xun of Shandong, but Liang Zuoyou of Shandong. He has a good business sense. Seeing that there were many young people who had dropped out of university, he took the opportunity of "donating a school" to transform the correspondence college into "Zhongzheng College." The word "college" is already attractive enough, and adding the words "Zhongzheng" naturally makes it even more extraordinary. Not to mention this, he even sent telegrams to various counties in a "joint" tone, asking them to "recommend" students. Good, many young people came upon hearing the news. As Hao Guanru said, "The number of students suddenly increased, exceeding 200, exceeding 300, and exceeding 500 in less than two weeks. Classrooms, dormitories, and utensils became a serious problem all at once." I once braved the cold wind to visit. The so-called "Zhongzheng College" is just a few dilapidated houses and a small, low-lying Yanguang Temple on Caomen Street. The houses are dilapidated, the students live on the damp ground, and a small office only has a table for collecting fees. I also saw a mimeograph machine and two staff members who were students on loan. The regulations stipulate that each student pays 100,000 yuan. The poor young people collected more than 50 million yuan and sent it to Liang Zuoyou of Henan.

Incompetent Professors

The "college" also has various departments. Who are the people in them? They are almost all incompetent professors from Henan University, who are the "comrades" of Liang Zuoyou of Henan. The dean of academic affairs is Yang Zhenhua, the dean of student affairs is Chen Zibei, the director of education is Zhao Wanli, and the professor is Ren Fangqiu. These people colluded and set up a heinous scam to deceive the lovable young people. Let's take a look at the secret No. 3 gray telegram sent by this group of educational swindlers to various counties. It has a seal as large as the seal of the Pacification Commissioner:

"In order to celebrate Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday and respond to the school donation movement in various places, this college has renamed the university lecture class organized by the Henan Correspondence College as Zhongzheng College and has officially established it by telegraphing Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Education on October 31. According to the investigation of the source of students of this college, the counties were previously requested by the correspondence college to send recommendations by letter for further study, originally to train middle school teachers. Now that it has been renamed Zhongzheng College, the nature is no different from that of a general university. It is divided into five departments: mathematics, physics, literature, history, education, art, law, and political science, specializing in cultivating talents. Since the time for this semester is short, the counties are requested to strictly examine the recommended students in accordance with the regulations and report to the college with a letter before the end of November for admission without examination..."

Not to mention this, let's look at what it says in the minutes of their meeting. The following resolutions were made at the first school affairs meeting on December 8:

(1) What to do with students recommended by various counties who report to the college after the deadline? Resolution: They shall all be allowed to report to the college.

(2) What to do if the dormitory cannot accommodate them? Resolution: Inform the students to raise their own funds when they report to the college.

(3) How to preserve the student status of students who need to ask for leave to return home due to special circumstances? Resolution: The student status shall be preserved.

(4) How to make up the lessons of students who are late? Resolution: A. Those who fail the midterm exam shall be allowed to make up the lessons in the next semester; B. Those who do not participate in the exam shall retake the course.

(5) How to deal with tuition fees if students who have reported to the college and paid tuition fees are approved by the school to return home due to special circumstances? Resolution: For students who report to the college and pay tuition fees after donating a school, both tuition fees and student status shall be preserved.

(6) How to handle student grades? Resolution: Leave it to the professors to handle in full.

(7) How to build the school buildings? Resolution: First build the lecture hall with seats, four rooms per hall, start planning immediately, and complete it before the start of the next semester.

(8) How to regulate the school system of this college? Resolution: Adopt the credit system.

(9) Whether to add departments in the next semester? Resolution: Add the Department of Journalism.

Scam Exposed

Needless to say, let's understand the true nature of this college from the confession of this group of swindlers. Students pay tuition fees, but there is no place to live, no classroom to attend classes, they can go home, and they can preserve their student status. What a brilliant method of "preferential treatment"! More than 50 million yuan, excluding more than 20 million yuan that was squandered by them, more than 30 million yuan is deposited in commercial firms. Taking a 10% interest rate as an example, the pure interest is 5 million yuan per month! In this day and age, there are ways to make money, it depends on whether you can "be unconventional." Today, there are also dregs of "swindling money" in the education sector.

How was this scam exposed? It turned out that some lovable young people, after being swindled to Kaifeng and realizing the truth, inquired about the situation with their fellow villagers in the Senate. At the fourth standing committee meeting of the Provincial Senate on the 9th, they sent a letter to the Education Department requesting them to attend and report on the handling of this school. The Chief Secretary of the Education Department, Le Tian, said: "The predecessor of the college was originally a correspondence college, first in Nanyang, which was supplementary education in nature. During the school donation movement, it directly telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Education. It only notified the provincial government to investigate. Although it did not receive a reply, it officially established itself without authorization and notified various counties to recommend students. Regardless of whether it meets the regulations and procedures for donating a school, according to laws and regulations, the recommendation of students is limited to normal school students. Even Zhongda University cannot recommend students. This move by the college is extremely illegal! After learning about it last week, we have submitted a signed report to the provincial government for instructions." The provincial government and the Education Department are only focusing on the legal aspects and not on deceiving young people and defrauding them of money. The handling methods formulated by the Provincial Senate are:

(1) The Education Department should immediately order the college to be sealed up.

(2) The people in charge of the college should be sent to the court for interrogation to prevent them from absconding.

(3) All tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by the college should be refunded in full and compensate the students for their losses.

(4) The Education Department should immediately telegraph the various counties to stop recommending students and prevent them from being deceived.

(5) The circumstances of the punishment of the college should be published in newspapers.

On the night of the 9th, this swindler was arrested!

The students' hard-earned money of tens of millions has been sealed up.

Three Opinions

This scam caused a sensation throughout Henan. The friends of "Liang Zuoyou of Henan" even moved around and shamelessly said that this scam guest was the "Wu Xun of Henan!" The truth is here. This great president has been transferred to the court for interrogation.

More than 500 lovable young people have become the most pitiful figures in this scam, and society is most concerned about them. On the 13th, they entertained the press and said painfully: They came here after suffering hardships in order to seek knowledge, and now they have been severely deceived. They are panicked and anxious and hope that those who care about them will give them more assistance! They put forward three opinions:

(1) They hope that the government will change the illegal "Zhongzheng College" into a private university.

(2) Send them to the soon-to-be-established commercial colleges and other specialized schools.

(3) They hope to deal with this issue quickly to avoid delaying their studies and time.

Resettlement Problem

How to deal with it is not yet known. The media and the Senate are appealing to the authorities to pay attention to the resettlement problem of these more than 500 deceived young people!

In Henan, strange things often happen in the education sector, which is also inevitable. The whole of Henan is being persecuted by internal strife, the people are living in suffering, and living under the ravages of war. All aspects are not worth seeing, and all aspects are progressing in an abnormal way—how can the education sector be an exception?

This scam shows the serious problems in Henan education. Not only are there many young people out of school, but also the universities, middle schools, and elementary schools should be reorganized. In the period of celebrating Chairman Chiang's birthday and actively launching the school donation movement, the emergence of this major scam is a great regret and indignation!

A Glimpse of Suao Fishing Port (Sent by Jiang Muyun, Special Correspondent of this Newspaper)

There are a total of more than 570 male and female workers here. People from this province account for 98%. Some have been working here since the factory opened and have never left. They are experienced and skilled. They are a group of hardworking and meritorious unsung heroes in the industrial sector of Taiwan Province. There are 68 employees, about 34% of whom are from other provinces and about 56% of whom are from this province, but there is no gap here and they are very harmonious. Only after sound personnel management can we talk about increasing production. What's more, this is the only rubber factory in this province, and I have unlimited hope for it!

### Service Ethics

— Lecture by Zheng Jiapu, recorded by You Maoquan

The Chinese nation has always emphasized morality, but now moral concepts have weakened with this war. Therefore, unimaginable things often happen in society now. However, if a country wants to be strong and a nation wants to revive, it must emphasize morality under any circumstances! Even within a group, factory, business, or even family, morality should be the prerequisite. Now I will talk about the two words "sincerity" and "public spirit":

"Sincerity": When doing things for others, you must treat their affairs as your own, and be even more considerate than they are. You should also be sincere in dealing with people, and never be hypocritical or artificial. Zhu Xi said, "Those who cannot move others have not yet achieved sincerity." From this, we can see the importance of the meaning of "sincerity."

"Public Spirit": No matter what you do, only by abandoning self-interest and forgetting personal prejudices can you reach the stage of "public spirit." At the same time, you can further dedicate yourself to the cause from "utmost impartiality," and only in this way can you achieve results in your career.

Technology in books is just general theory. If you go from school to the factory without experiencing hard work and practical experience, the results you get will be very limited. Most people are inherently averse to hard work and like to enjoy themselves, but by overcoming hardships and difficulties and forming a habit, although it may be difficult at first, the result will be that the suffering will eventually be followed by happiness, and you can also find joy in labor. Especially now, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek shows us "After the completion of the War of Resistance, construction begins," the textile industry occupies a very important position in the light industry sector, and it is also the primary issue for the people's livelihood of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. At present, factories in our country that have been destroyed are difficult to restore due to various limitations. If we seek to expand further, it is definitely not possible in the short term. However, according to the calculation of our country's 450 million population, clothing and bedding are not self-sufficient, so in the future, we will definitely need to expand according to specific plans.

### A Year's Plan

— Yi

After passing the end of the thirty-fifth year, the general industry and commerce seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, although the upcoming end of the lunar year is still a major event pressing on the heart. Many manufacturers do not know how to deal with this imminent crisis.

However, the crisis will eventually pass. How to pass it, of course, is another question. In my opinion, overcoming the crisis is important, but the plan for the thirty-sixth year seems to be even more important.

All manufacturers who are thinking about and considering how to overcome the end of the year, and the responsible personnel of the authorities, may have a feeling, wondering why this year's crisis is so difficult to break? Although they know that the biggest reason is due to high-interest loans. However, how did they incur such a huge amount? Therefore, after overcoming the crisis, we must do a good job, and by doing a good job, we mean doing it cautiously, or doing it with a plan.

Originally, any manufacturer cannot escape the three most important departments, namely "production," "sales," and "economic management." Speaking of production, wages are so high, and the cost of living increases monthly, with numerous difficulties. Speaking of sales, transportation has not been fully restored, and the region has not been developed, so even if it is sold, it is very limited. Speaking of economic management, it is even more laborious. Many manufacturers spend most of their time every day, and important time, on the management of silver, moving east to make up for the west, and being stretched thin.

However, in fact, there is no such ideal way to do a good job. Production, sales, and economic management are inseparable and must be complementary. If there is a situation of taking care of one thing and losing sight of the other, it will cause the entire organization to lose balance, and over time, it will become unmanageable.

"Prevention is better than cure" is originally a most valuable saying, and it is even more valuable to apply it in the industrial sector. Currently, what most people are busy with is treatment work rather than prevention work. Therefore, treatment cannot be perfect, even treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. How can we talk about prevention?

But on careful thought, prevention work can be done and is a basic work. At the beginning of this year, we should formulate a production plan for the whole year, design complete and comprehensive statistical charts and budget tables. This arduous and important work may involve gathering every important department of the entire organization and spending several days and nights to complete it. Then, follow this plan to divide the work and cooperate, so that when the time comes, the responsible personnel can look at the forms and make decisions about everything without being flustered and disorganized.

When preparing this plan, for production, we should investigate the increase or decrease in sales figures of various products over the years to determine which ones should continue to be maintained and which ones should be discontinued. Because producing too many types of products is an important reason for poor turnover.

For sales, we should investigate the past sales, existing sales, and potential sales in each place and region. Then, use effective advertising to coordinate. There must be a complete plan. At this critical moment, if we only know what is happening but not why it is happening, then many difficulties will arise.

As for economic management, it can be said that it balances production and sales and is also the driving force for production and sales. Currently, most manufacturers rely on high-interest loans to quench their thirst because of the lack of working capital.

In theory, the so-called working capital is "liquid assets that can be used for business operations." This definition is more appropriate and more suitable for the current environment than "working capital is the difference between liquid assets and liquid liabilities." Because working capital absolutely needs to be flexible.

To do economic management work, statistics, budgets, and charts are the best tools. Without these tools, it is like a ship without a compass. Today, we have to deal with a huge expenditure, and tomorrow, we have to deal with an overdue loan. The progress of affairs will never have a normal day.

The environment no longer allows us to lose normality. Therefore, if there is no detailed plan, we will not only fail to create the environment, but we will inevitably be dominated by the environment, and even be sacrificed by the environment.

The past is already past, and everything in the future is waiting for us to "take good care of ourselves." I think enlightened people in the industrial and commercial circles must have the same feeling.

### American Working Women and the Department of Labor

— Fei Wen

Today, the number of working women in the United States is close to seventeen million. In 1870, there were less than two million working women. During these seventy years, women have continuously struggled to improve working conditions, raise employment standards, and strive for equal treatment and opportunities for men and women.

At first, with the advent of the machine age, more and more women went from home to the factory, and the matter of women's paid work involved many problems. At that time, most women were unorganized, untrained, and influenced by prejudice, and did not make much progress. Therefore, women were forced to accept any job, regardless of conditions, and were subjected to greater exploitation than men. Unable to overcome this situation, they turned to the state and federal governments for help and fought against the factors that harmed their employment.

Before World War II, progress in this direction was slow. But after the outbreak of the war, there was an unprecedented need for female workers to fill the jobs left by soldiers who had gone to war. Women entered various industries and positions, replacing men, and even doing extremely dangerous work. They gained new skills, they understood the meaning of improving the organization of working conditions, and they proved to themselves and the world that in addition to the traditional work of managing the home and raising children, they were able to handle many jobs in various industries.

As of July 8, 1918, the United States Department of Labor had only been in existence for more than five years. At that time, the Department of Labor established a temporary Industrial Women's Service Office, whose task was to protect working women during the war. This temporary agency later became permanent and had broader work goals. Women and various progressive forces that exposed the exploitation of working women's interests prompted the government to establish a permanent agency whose task was to support and assist women in achieving the following goals:

Equal employment and promotion opportunities for men and women; no unfair discrimination based on gender, race, age, or marital status; investigation of working women's salaries to ensure that salaries are sufficient to meet the needs of a rich and healthy life; working hours not exceeding eight hours per day or forty hours per week; working hours not set at night; women should have intermittent rest periods in industries where workers should cooperate with the speed of machines; factories should stipulate ample time and comfortable facilities for female workers to dine at the workplace; the workplace should have clean, well-ventilated, and well-lit conditions; the workshop should be equipped with insurance machines and other equipment to prevent disasters; sufficient and clean work equipment; progressive personnel management methods; and the opportunity for collective bargaining.

In June 1920, Congress transformed the temporary Industrial Women's Service Office into a permanent agency and established a Women's Bureau within the Department of Labor. The establishment of this agency was truly a milestone in the history of working women, and in fact, it can also be said to be a milestone in the history of all working people. By 1920, the number of working women had increased to 8.5 million, accounting for one-fifth of the total national labor force. The Women's Bureau immediately established close contact with all employed and job-seeking women, regardless of their race, creed, or marital status. The Women's Bureau immediately became one with women in all occupational fields.

The Women's Bureau initially did a lot of work to remedy various shortcomings. In order to correct erroneous views, the Bureau published accurate news and statistics, which were based on investigations of various factories, offices, warehouses, and interviews with women. In order to determine the Bureau's policies and plans, it also conducted various tests and research on issues such as the health of female workers. The policies and standards determined by the Women's Bureau for female workers were also the result of careful consideration and consultation with other organizations (such as state labor departments, labor organizations, and representatives of employers).

Today, there are 200 kinds of bulletins reporting the situation of working women, as well as pamphlets, newsletters, and films for people to use. The women's community has recently printed many books, such as "Telephone Operators," "Home-Based Working Women," and "Equal Pay Regulations." Those reports on working women's working hours, wages, and working conditions are particularly important. The investigations conducted in response to requests from various parties or jointly with labor agency chiefs often serve as the basis for taking legislative action.

The Bureau cannot formulate any regulations, but it actively studies issues related to existing or proposed regulations and often makes recommendations. Today, considerable progress has been made in legislation regarding the regulation of women's salaries and working hours. In the states, almost three-quarters (including Puerto Rico and Alaska) have minimum wage regulations. States that stipulate that women's working hours shall not exceed eight hours per day or forty-four hours per week account for half of the states.

The Women's Bureau can also be regarded as a source of information. Whenever necessary, it provides public agencies, women's organizations, labor unions, employers, and the public with technical advice, facts, and figures.

In women's activities, the Women's Bureau has occupied an increasingly important position today. In the past thirty years, the Women's Bureau has made considerable progress in women's occupations. Although the Women's Bureau feels that it is still far from its final goal, it has assessed the changing economic situation and formulated future plans to adapt to the development and urgent needs of the post-war era.

### Introduction to Business Management

— Xu Baiyi

Implementation of Personnel Management 1. Recruitment:

When a business organization needs staff or a manufacturing factory needs labor, it must find ways to hire. When there is a surplus of personnel, it is very convenient to recruit employees. Once it is announced, many people will apply. After screening among those applicants, you can get the employees you need. However, when employees are not easy to recruit, you must consider how to make employees happy to participate. This can be considered from the employee's perspective. Generally, employees are willing to take a job for several reasons, either because of the considerable salary or the provision of food and lodging, or because it is very close to home, or because there are extra allowances, or because the scope of the business organization is very large, and there can be considerable security in the future life, or because the business organization is a promising and prospective career.

Among the above reasons, it is not necessarily possible to have all of them completely. Then, perhaps having one or two can also make employees willing to participate.

The following methods are often used when employees are usually needed:

A. Advertising in newspapers: In the larger newspapers in various places, there are classified advertisements, including a recruitment column. When a business organization needs to hire employees, it can publish advertisements several times. Generally, applicants are required to write their age, native place, education, experience, and required salary. Sometimes photos are required, and sometimes a cover letter is required. The so-called cover letter is to write your name, age, native place, marital status, past resume, and expected remuneration in the letter. When advertising in the newspaper, if you do not want the outside world to know the name of the business organization (to avoid introductions from acquaintances), you can use a post office box, and applicants can send the application letters to the post office box.

B. Job Wanted Column: In the classified advertisements in the newspaper, in addition to the recruitment column, there is also a job wanted column, which can also be paid attention to. But if you want to hire one or two employees, you can look at this job wanted column. It is impossible to hire a large number of employees.

C. Career Guidance Center: The Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society runs a career guidance center, and the Ministry of Social Affairs also runs a job placement center. All job seekers go there to register. If you need staff, asking them to introduce you is also a way.

D. Various schools: When hiring staff, sending letters to various schools and asking the school authorities to recommend introductions is also a way. But this method cannot be applied when recruiting experienced staff, because students who have just come out of school do not have experience in handling affairs.

### Scientific Theory of Literature and Art

— Wang Pingling

Literature and art are the forerunners of science. The relationship between science and literature and art has long been recognized by the academic community. It was the Renaissance in Europe that led to the religious revolution and the prosperity of science. This is because literature and art cannot be separated from reality. Only those writers who claim to be "art for art's sake" avoid the ethereal heaven and try to exhaust the subtleties of the universe and human life from a grain of sand, sympathizing with the flowers, plants, insects, and fish in creation, and from sympathy to understanding, from understanding to enlightenment, and treating what they understand and enlighten as the ten rules of night crying and the singing of orioles, just to comfort the loneliness of their souls. As for the general writers who pursue truth, they are not eager to seek their own comfort. Sometimes they do not even care about their own lives. It is because they have focused their entire souls on society, life, and all the realities of joys and sorrows. Their supreme joy is to search for reality, reflect reality, and reveal the secrets of reality and this ultimate goal. Therefore, the spirit of science is clear, correct, to transform the dark reality, radiate the light of truth, and increase the happiness of life, and literature and art are the same.

What is the so-called "artistic conscience"? The most thorough explanation is the spirit of "seeing righteousness and daring to do it, and hating evil like hatred." When writers encounter the dark side of society when dealing with real-world issues, they are not disappointed or pessimistic, but always hold a positive revolutionary attitude, the faith and enthusiasm of religious scholars, and strive to eliminate the factors of darkness; and those elements who hide under the wings of darkness, willingly degenerate, sneak around, and hinder progress are the very factors that should be eliminated. They deeply hate the writers' love of meddling because they cannot allow themselves to hide in a dark corner and enjoy a lewd and shameless life as much as possible, and they must put them to death quickly; this is the same as the scientists' suffering from the killing of the Pope of the Hundred Roman Empire and the persecution of all feudal forces; therefore, the enemies of science are also the enemies of literature and art; and the only thing that enables science to progress smoothly, regardless of everything on the road of science, and takes on the task of clearing away those stumbling blocks, is literature and art. Science is the engine of the times, and literature and art are the driving force for promoting science. The passionate flames of literature and art can burn down the stale shackles of scientists, so that scientists have the freedom to think and the freedom to invent, and finally merge with literature and art, issuing turbulent waves, converging into the main trend of the times, washing away the adverse currents of life, and creating a new century for mankind.

Literature and art can also gain new inspiration from the progress of science. Writers often discover the secrets of the universe and life in the world of science, making the vocabulary richer, the image of the description more realistic, and the ideal pursued more宏远. That is to say, scientists can not dabble in literary and artistic works, but writers can not but accept the baptism of science in order to understand the achievements of science. For example, if we want to describe the changes in the seasons, the obscurity of the sky, the brightness and darkness of the sun, moon, and stars, the rise and fall of plants, flowers, and trees, and the birth and death of insects, fish, birds, and beasts, we cannot be competent if we lack knowledge of natural science. Now the scope of literary and artistic writing has long been free from the shackles of "art for art's sake," expanding from personal lyricism to the description of life, forcing writers to go to all aspects of society to capture the reality of becoming this problem and use it as a topic for answering. Literature and art are eagerly desiring the help of sociology, economics, and history. At the same time, if you want to analyze human nature, dissect life, and point out the bright path for mankind, you must have a good higher and deeper cultivation in philosophy, psychology, and so on. In addition, literary and artistic workers should often leave the writing room and run to the work positions to experience real life in work and learn the active knowledge that cannot be conveyed in books. For example, if you want to write about workers, you have to go directly to factories, farms, and mines to observe their living lives, study their real economic phenomena, and grasp the crux of their pain. In this way, writers really need to browse books on the study of social problems.

Many writers often show the characteristics of their works because they have a more profound cultivation in a certain science and are deeply influenced. For example, the playwright Gao Ertehuasui is a lawyer who is familiar with the law. In the play "Justice," attacking the British prison system shows that he is an expert who understands the secrets, and makes the play attract society's attention during the performance, so that the government has to carry out the improvement of the prison; Chekhov is a student of the medical school, and has research on pathology and anatomy. Therefore, he often uses the description and analysis of mental patients to achieve amazing achievements. In the Tao, it can be seen that scientific thought can not only enrich the content of literature, but also the technical help of literature is also indelible.

Today, when science has developed to the atomic bomb, human civilization must be accompanied by the high progress of science, which has undergone drastic changes, and the changes in life will be like a kaleidoscope, colorful and elusive. Therefore, literary and artistic workers must adapt to the atomic bomb century and meet the new requirements of the new people in the new stage, then in the field of literature and art, they must also change a new set of methods to engage in sowing and cultivation, which is inevitable. In the past, literature and art promoted science, and literature and art were the driving force for promoting science. Now science has run to the front, and literature and art must follow science to catch up and learn again in the world of science! If literary and artistic workers stick to the old ways, are complacent with the existing Chen method, despise everything, and are complacent, they will be drowned in the sea by the wave set off by the new science. 1945, 24 in Chongqing

### Random Thoughts on Poetry

— Lin Feng

The earth is barren, and the poet plants flowers; mankind is isolated, and the poet builds bridges; society is cold, and the poet brings sunshine; philosophers explore the truth, but the poet sows the truth in people's hearts.

### Winter on the Li River

— Shi Bei

In Guilin's winter, you can't see snowy days. After the clear and crisp autumn, the trees wither with the west wind, and the green mountain peaks turn into a deep black color like blue indigo. The rugged and steep stone walls are all exposed in their original form. The scattered mountain tops near and far stand quietly by the Li River, like an old man waiting for the end of the year, passing away quietly day by day.

The water of the Li River, even in the deep winter, will not freeze a thin layer of ice on the surface. The river water flows clearly and smoothly, past some rocky shores in the cold and lonely shore. The river surface at this time is not as full as the autumn tide of the riverbed.

Standing on the Zhongzheng Bridge or crossing the river in a small folk boat, browsing the mountains and rivers of the Li River in this way will make you feel that the natural scenery in winter is indeed plain and thin. If people are in it and can blend with nature, then the flavor of life's ups and downs will suddenly strike your heart.

Although there is no ice and snow in winter on the Li River, unlike other places, a slight stop on the river bank makes people unbearable to the cold; however, when the Li River arrives in the deep winter, there are very few people on the river and the shore. Only every morning, in the misty rain and the white mist on the river surface, the lead-colored sky presses very low, and only a vague shadow remains of the mountain peaks of the distant river. At this time, three or five bamboo rafts appear on the river in teams. The fishermen wear straw raincoats and slowly row the oars, letting the egrets on the bamboo rafts nimbly dive into the water to catch fish. From morning till night, they come and go at will. This is a small scene that can be seen everywhere on the Li River in winter. Seeing them coming and going leisurely and enjoying themselves, but under the whip of life, how much bitterness and辛辛 do they not know?

The winter of the Li River is beautiful and lonely, followed by disasters after the fire and iron washed away. I think she is even thinner this year!

### Three Poems

— Ye Shugan

Beside the Bridge

Although the former year's delicate smiles have passed through several blossoming flowers, the sound of frogs, the kind whispers, seem to be still yesterday, that night the blue sky outside the window was shining with stars and moon.

Now, who will make us meet again beside the bridge, under that dim light?

(You have not disappeared, your slender demeanor.)

Tonight, I wipe off the dust from the old mirror.

Unforgettable the traces carefully drawn on that day,

Drunkenness cannot solve frowning brows,

(There is a sad phoenix flute under the corridor.)

Vase Flower

I saw a person's life from the vase flower,

She buds in the greenhouse,

Quickly feels open, quickly withers, and withers.

Picked Up by Chance

The autumn rain dusk, the street lights reflect the hurried steps of the returning people.

### A RECORD OF LIU DAJIE

— FU JUN

Long ago, twenty years prior, it was a time when the average young literary person was fascinated by new literary works. The works of Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, and Yu Dafu captivated countless young men and women. In particular, Lu Xun's "Nahan" and "Panghuang," Guo Moruo's "Goddess" and "Starry Sky," and Yu Dafu's "Lost Lamb" and "Nine Kinds of Diary," among other brilliant works, were regarded as invaluable treasures by the enthusiastic and devoted literary youth. During this time, there was an Unnamed Society, presided over by Mr. Lu Xun, which published a series of Unnamed Books, and Mr. Liu Dajie's collection of creative works was already included.

Like many writers of that time, Mr. Dajie's creative content was inevitably about expressing the melancholic emotions of young men and women, with the school environment as the main subject of description. However, there were also some realistic short stories about impoverished rural villages at that time. In any case, like most writers of the time, Mr. Dajie's works mostly wrote about the comedies and tragedies of love between men and women. In the early stages, the writing was straightforward, and full of passionate energy, which was a common characteristic of most writers. This was not unique to Mr. Dajie. Over time, the writing evolved from straightforward to refined, and the passion no longer had the uncontrollable momentum of the beginning. In the recent decade, Mr. Dajie's works, in my personal opinion, have been following the same path as Ba Jin. Both are known for their passionate and unrestrained style, but when it comes to a more profound and steady writing attitude, I would first recommend Dajie. Ba Jin is still inevitably too "carefree".

He has a tall and slender figure, an ordinary face, but powerful eyes, a dashing demeanor, and speaks with a Hunan accent. Talking to him, listening to his lectures or speeches, no one is not captivated by his eloquent and inexhaustible conversation. It was probably one summer fifteen years ago, when I transferred from the distant North to Shanghai, and attended his "Literary Trends" and "Selection of Ci Poetry" courses for a few hours in a university classroom. At that time, the scorching sun was like fire, and the wind was nowhere to be seen. But the small classroom was still packed with people, and everyone forgot about the humid and hot weather. No one felt cramped or suffocated because of the crowd and the heat. They just felt that Mr. Dajie's lectures were excellent and very pleasant to listen to, just like a traveler who suddenly finds a spring after a long journey! I still regret that I did not have the fortune to attend more of Mr. Dajie's classes. In fact, I did not study literature, but I had long ago made a wish for literature, which continues to this day.

Mr. Dajie has published many books, published by Zhonghua, Da Dong, Beixin and other publishing houses. He has served as the chief editor of "Modern Student," "Hai Chao" and other publications, and is currently the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts at National Jinan University. In recent years, he seems to have written less, but he has already shifted from literary creation to the work of organizing and editing ancient Chinese books, especially poetry, in which he has many excellent works. Mr. Dajie's wife, Li Huiqun, is also a female writer, who has edited two books, "Selected Poems of Women Through the Ages" and "Selected Ci Poetry of Women Through the Ages," both published by Zhonghua Book Company. She is currently teaching at Shanghai Municipal No. 1 Girls' High School, which is also worth mentioning in passing.

### THE MAGDALEN

— DI XIANG

Di Xiang (Titian 1482-1576) did not like ordinary academic subjects since childhood, drawing and painting randomly all day long. Finally, he achieved his ambition and became the authoritative painter of the Venetian school. THE MAGDALEN is taken from the Bible – a prostitute. The style is solid, the color is brilliant, the brushstrokes are delicate, and no small part is relaxed. In addition to "Flora," this work can be called representative. (Lion)

### AN INCH OF LAND, AN INCH OF BLOOD 139

— YE JINGFENG

Indeed, if Tsurumi's plan fails, then everything is in Konoe's hands, whether it's half an hour, an hour, or even ten years. If the plan succeeds, at nine o'clock, the attack has already been preliminarily launched; around ten o'clock, when Tsurumi is about to enter Beppu, the second step of the plan will also be unveiled; a large portion of the troops should have already infiltrated the flower-filled city of Beppu. Then, around eleven o'clock, there should be a major explosion. In other words, if Tsurumi's plan succeeds, everything should be in Tsurumi's hands. Time should be controlled by Tsurumi.

But the fact has already proven that Tsurumi did not control time, but rather was controlled by time; because the long and short hands of his watch both pointed to eleven o'clock. He had been sitting in this magnificent guest room for nearly half an hour. This half hour was really not easy to get through. At first, he looked at his watch every five or six minutes, and within each time interval, countless thoughts churned in his mind: "Why is the street so quiet?" "Can't Anzaka command?" "Will 〇12 mess things up?" "Impossible; if there's any problem, they should give me some news, and they can't leave me hanging in mid-air, swaying back and forth."

The closer it got to the scheduled eleven o'clock, the more frequently Tsurumi looked at his watch; every two minutes, every minute, he looked at his watch again and again. As it approached eleven o'clock, he simply bent his arm, and his eyes were fixed on the dial, watching the small second hand move forward regularly, one step at a time.

"It's over!" The long hand on the watch, perfectly straight, had already pointed to twelve o'clock, the short hand had reached eleven o'clock, and the second hand had moved past the sixty-minute mark. "However…" Tsurumi's ears and temples were buzzing, indicating that his entire nervous system had been overstressed and had undergone drastic changes. Fortunately, there was a small thought shift, "However," which eased the overstressed nerves a little.

"However," what? He thought of the time in his plan, which was not exactly nine o'clock, ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, etc. Because this thing called a clock is reliable and unreliable, there are always some problems with being too fast or too slow, or stopping. Moreover, according to experience, this type of secret work should not be timed too precisely, but only between a few o'clock, or around a few o'clock. The word "around" is not to relax the time limit; it is to say that it is best to be on time, but secret work has some obstacles. In case it is not possible to start on time, the word "around" can slightly relax the time limit. The time for his planned major explosion was "around eleven o'clock."

However, these were also Tsurumi's self-justifications, slightly relaxing his tense mind. According to his usual work habits, he himself would not allow a single second of error. Now that it was eleven o'clock, and no signal had been sent, he realized that things were not going well; the progress of the plan must have had a major setback, or perhaps encountered a major obstacle.

This "around" also has a limit, doesn't it? How far to the left? How far to the right? Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes? It shouldn't exceed fifteen minutes, approximately. But the long hand of his watch had already pointed to one point, and the second hand, annoyingly, still moved forward, one step at a time. Tsurumi could not sit still any longer; he jumped up from the sofa.

Since that secretary Nishihara left this guest room, not a single sound could be heard in the vast city of Beppu. The corridor outside this guest room should logically be the main thoroughfare of this part of the building, but not a single footstep could be heard. Although it was almost midnight, Nishihara clearly said that Konoe was still working; there should be people helping with the work, at least a few people serving, but why was there not a single sound? The only explanation was that Nishihara's words might be a smokescreen; or perhaps Konoe's office was not in this part of the building?

Could he not run outside the guest room to snoop around? At least he could walk to the door and eavesdrop near the crack in the door. This he could not do; and absolutely must not do. According to Tsurumi's complex and alert mind, if his plan did not fail, and things were progressing steadily, perhaps there would be a slight delay of eight or ten minutes, which would be possible, and there would be no need for him to snoop around or eavesdrop. On the other hand, if things were not going well, and the plan had failed, he would be under house arrest here; perhaps there were eyes watching his every move on the walls. If he acted recklessly, there would definitely be even more unpleasant consequences.

He could only pace back and forth in the empty space of the room; this was an inevitable action after sitting for a long time, and could not be criticized. Why was he looking at his watch all the time? He could also answer: because Nishihara said that Konoe would be working for more than half an hour, and he was looking at his watch just to know if the time had arrived. These actions were not out of line. However, to go out to snoop around or eavesdrop by the door crack, although he could still argue strongly, at least he would lose the status of a gentleman and a soldier.

### AMNESTY

The National Government announced an amnesty decree on New Year's Day. After reading its contents, it was felt that the scope of amnesty was very broad. Except for those who committed treason, corruption, or killed direct ascendants, or those who were sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment for opium and drugs, the remaining crimes were reduced by one-half or generally pardoned. Therefore, some people are calculating that the criminals in the grain loan case can be pardoned, the chief criminal in the Yanshi case can be spared death, and something can be reduced by half... This kind of speculation is naturally very well-founded, and these prisoners are very fortunate to be able to feel this once-in-a-thousand-years grace.

Originally, the National Government had the possibility of issuing an amnesty decree on New Year's Day last year, the first New Year's Day after the victory. The reason for delaying it for a year may be that the victory had just arrived, and everything was in a state of chaos. In addition, the investigation and trial of war criminals and traitors, and the reorganization of the judicial organs in various occupied areas, had not yet been carried out. Now, these issues have come to an end, and the constitution has been officially announced on New Year's Day. It is very appropriate to issue this supreme grace at this time!

No matter how many people will benefit from this grace in the future, we believe that the judicial organs should let those who are granted amnesty understand the government's intention in issuing this special pardon. If they are released in a muddleheaded manner, it will not only lack solemnity, but also easily encourage people's侥幸之心 (侥幸之心: a fluke mentality).

### SKETCHES OF TEN MAJOR ANIMALS IN AMERICA'S LARGEST ZOO

— BAO ZHONGQI

In the past fifty years, ninety-six million tourists have visited the Bronx Zoo in New York, USA, and it is said that they all came to see the true faces of the ten major animals. Here, we will list these ten major animals in order of the tourists' ratings:

Miss Panda

The first place winner is our country's "honor product" - Miss Panda. Her walking posture is like a bear. Countless adults and children surround her, because she is the most interesting and the rarest and most precious animal – (in the mountains of distant China, only eight have been hunted, half of which were given to the United States). Pandas are now highly respected in the United States, and the delicacies they eat are tender bamboo from Florida.

Gibbon

The second place winner is the gibbon nicknamed "Mother". She shelters her fifteen-month-old "Junior" and does not allow people to take pictures. If you insist on taking pictures, she will consider you malicious and glare at the camera. She is sometimes very lively, but sometimes she is very melancholy and stubborn. She has a strange temper, that is, she is unwilling to drink water in the water trough, and would rather dip her finger in it to eat.

Sea Lions

The third place winners are two sea lions. They have roared to eat lunch, or yelled to amuse guests. Their skin color is very bright, and they are good at opening their mouths to ask you for fish to eat.

Gorilla

The fourth place winner is Makoao - a gorilla. This is a very violent animal in appearance. His frown and wrinkled nose show his strict and stubborn personality. His walking attitude is also like a person.

Gentle Elephant

The fifth place winner is the gentle elephant. His body is as big as a tree trunk, which makes people laugh. His large and movable ears are like a peanut plant. Of the three here, two are from India and one is African.

Black-footed Penguin

The sixth place winner is the black-footed penguin - that fish-eating animal. People are often kicked by him, because he can also stand upright and walk like a person. He has a white "tie", but with an extra tail.

Hummingbird

The seventh place winner is the hummingbird. His long beak and beautiful wings attract many tourists. He is fed homemade sweet nectar in the zoo.

Mountain Lions

The eighth place winners are two mountain lions. Their movements are very soft and elegant, and they are very smart, or rather cunning, using tricks to play with humans.

Lion

The ninth place winner is a lion. He is not very clever, but in fact almost everyone likes him, because his appearance is so smart and beautiful, noble and generous, especially his roar, which is even more moving.

Spider

The tenth place winner is the "black widow spider", which also attracts the interest of many tourists. Although poisonous, she does not hurt people, so many people like to approach her.

After translating the above passage, we cannot help but feel infinite emotion for the zoos in China (especially Shanghai).

### THE WORLD-RENOWNED SCOTTISH POLICE

— JIAN HUA

Abridged and translated from this issue of World Weekly

The name of the Scottish Police Headquarters has spread to various countries. Their quick handling of cases and the mystery of arresting criminals are indeed unbelievable. The general public calls them "tiger traps", which is of considerable value.

Underground Work

The Scottish Police Headquarters is the general command of the British police. Important British institutions are protected by the Bureau, which has great power and is directly under the Ministry of the Interior, and is not subject to the control of local officials. The headquarters is located on the banks of the Thames River, with magnificent buildings, eight floors high, and more than a thousand offices. Tunnels are opened underground, leading in all directions. The entrances and exits of the tunnels are either car companies, movie theaters, or department stores. People only see that the front of the headquarters is very quiet, but they do not know that the cars in the tunnels are busy and never stop. It is truly mysterious.

Strict and Complete

The police headquarters has about 30,000 people, one director-general, one deputy director-general, 220 police officers, and 3,008 patrol officers. There are departments for defense, maintenance, detective work, editing, inspection, justice, and telegraph. Each department has a director who is responsible for handling the affairs of the department. The defense department is responsible for defending against the other party's assassinations or attacks. The guns are strong, and the equipment is complete, no different from an elite army. The maintenance department is responsible for maintaining local order and correcting illegal assemblies and organizations. The police in this department do not carry weapons on weekdays, and their attitude is very kind. The detective department is responsible for seeking clues and investigating secrets. There are many people, most of whom are scattered in the industrial and commercial circles, taking the opportunity to spy, and the news is well-informed. The editing department is responsible for editing various newspapers. There are several kinds of daily newspapers, evening newspapers, weekly newspapers, and police reports. The printing expenses each year are also amazing. The inspection department is responsible for chemical testing of poisonous substances and studying the reasons for the victim's death. The fingerprint item alone has more than 25,000 kinds, which is very detailed. The other departments are also tightly organized and extremely complete.

The above seven departments are independent institutions. The seven departments are connected by a seven-person conference. The so-called seven people are the directors of the seven departments. If there are major cases or difficult problems, the seven-person conference will be held. Everyone will discuss them in detail, cooperate with each other, and strive to get to the bottom of the case and find out the truth.

Quick Case Solving

Most police officers are equipped with wireless radios in their pockets and use secret codes. If an unexpected event such as a robbery or a mob riot occurs, the news will reach all places within the range of the radio waves within five minutes. They can immediately cut off the main roads or dispatch large numbers of troops to provide assistance. Therefore, the scene of the incident will become a dragnet in an instant, and the bandits will have nowhere to escape.

To the left of the police headquarters is a lost and found office. Large items such as car trunks and small items such as a nail or a button, expensive items such as gold bars and gems, and cheap items such as old clothes and socks, are stored in the lost and found office. People who come to claim them are endless, like a department store.

To the right of the police headquarters is an exhibition hall. There are all kinds of things such as thieves' weapons, photos, counterfeit banknotes, extortion letters, disguises, narcotics, and clothing items. Each exhibit is accompanied by a description card, stating the year and month, the cause of the case, and detailed records. Therefore, writers who write detective novels regard the institute as a wholesale place for novel materials.

### Life is Too Short, Why Bother About Trivial Matters!

— CHUNLIANG, translated from "This Week's Digest"

"Life is too short, why bother about trivial matters," this is my most beloved motto, which has helped me through many painful experiences. Often, we let ourselves be upset by trivial matters that should be ignored and forgotten. Or because the man we helped is ungrateful to us... Or because the woman we thought was a friend is talking behind our backs... Or because the reward we thought was sure to belong to me was obtained by others. Things like these make us feel very disappointed, so much so that we can't work or sleep. But isn't that ridiculous? Here, we only have decades to live in this world, and we feel that many irreplaceable times have been lost to thinking about those unnecessary worries, and after a year, that matter will be forgotten by us and by anyone else. Let us dedicate our own lives to valuable work and emotions, to great thoughts, true love, and earth-shattering careers! Because life is too short, why bother about trivial matters!

### YOUNG DIPLOMAT, SOVIET UNION'S NEW FOREIGN MINISTER, GROMYKO

— MISHAN

The Soviet Council of Ministers recently appointed Gromyko as Deputy Foreign Minister—the familiar Soviet young diplomat, the current Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council.

With a handsome, slender build, jet-black hair, and always wearing a dark blue, crisp suit, with a shirt and French-style collar, Gromyko is one of the youngest and most handsome in the Security Council, only thirty-eight years old this year. Journalists are accustomed to calling him "the person who doesn't express opinions," because he has never expressed any opinions to reporters who ask him questions at meetings or banquets. Occasionally, he will answer reporters with two sentences: "The weather is not bad today," or something of the sort that doesn't make sense, or when a photographer asks to take a picture of him, he will nod and smile faintly. In addition, he is indeed a "person who does not express opinions" on more important events.

He is a member of the Supreme Soviet and has been awarded the Order of Lenin twice. He is now a confidant of Marshal Stalin and an important figure in the Communist Party. His career in the Soviet Union can be said to be smooth sailing. After graduating from the Moscow Institute of Economics, he worked as a teacher for two years, and at the age of thirty, he became the director of the American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After working for not long, he was sent to the Soviet Embassy in the United States as an advisor. In 1943, he was appointed as the Soviet Ambassador to the United States.

The first time he represented the Soviet Union at an international conference was at the Teheran Conference after he took office as ambassador; the second time was at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 (he was the middle seat of the Soviet delegation to the conference); the third time was this United Nations Security Council.

His consistent diplomatic technique in the Security Council is to add the Soviet interpretation to the United Nations Charter and criticize Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States for endangering peace. Therefore, the Security Council has produced many thorny issues. Of course, this cannot be attributed to Gromyko alone, but his suspicion of the "Western countries uniting to defeat the Soviet Union" is undoubtedly very strong. He said at the Security Council's discussion of the Iranian issue: "Recently, some elements have been using the Soviet-Iranian relationship to stir up the world's political atmosphere to help the actions of certain groups and advocate the creation of a new war." He even stormed out of the meeting over the Iranian issue.

Like other Soviet ambassadors, he usually does not attend banquets very much, but likes to play ball and play chess. He speaks extremely fluent English, but in public places, he only speaks Russian and never uses English. He often corrects sentences that have been translated incorrectly by translators.

He has a seventeen-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter, and the family is harmonious. In a hotel in New York, he does not eat American cuisine very much, but often teaches his wife to cook Russian peasant dishes.

(Translated from the December 1946 issue of "Happiness Magazine")

### WIT

— ZHONG QI

Dr. Zheng Zhangcheng, Dean of the College of Science at Shanghai University, is a biologist. His answer to the question of "Is there a conflict between science and religion?" is the most humorous and meaningful. He said:

I can illustrate it with just one example. For example, studying flower cultivation is science; but the flowers in the bride's hands and the wreaths in the family of the deceased are religion.

### EVERLASTING SONG

— YUAN PING

Articles are "refined after poverty"; music is probably also necessarily "poor" before it becomes "refined". Therefore, the members of the Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra need to taste the taste of "chronic hunger". When they perform in the future, it will definitely become an "everlasting song."

### COINCIDENCE

— FANG WEN

Three planes crashed in Shanghai in one day, and then another one came to Qingdao - "said to be a natural disaster."

On the fifth of last month, the Jiangwan Arsenal exploded, and on the sixth of the same month, the US military arsenal in Qingdao had an accident - "this is a man-made disaster."

Three hundred homeless children had a grand feast hosted by the US military on Christmas Day. The lucky brother Wang was deeply grateful to have escaped death. - "Everyone is happy."

Dr. Wang, 64, married Ms. Zhou, 52, in Shanghai; Dr. Dewey, 87, married Mrs. Grant, 42, in New York - "Old age brings joy."

The price of gold in Shanghai rises and falls by hundreds of thousands a day, and dozens of stores close down every day in various places - "Some are happy, some are sad"?

THIS TIME, THIS PLACE

### CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC

— FANG WEN

On New Year's Day, the restaurants in this city were still open for business, but on each glass window of his gate, a large red paper was pasted with the words:

"Please go to another store, our store is full every day, the boss also said that he has not made money, and does not give us employees a year-end bonus."

Labor-management disputes in Shanghai have changed from strikes to slowdowns, and from slowdowns to opening the door to thank guests.

### WINTER DEFENSE

— BAO ZHE

Yesterday I heard that a robbery occurred on Road, and the bandits were as many as eighteen, and they were all holding new weapons. Two policemen were disarmed by them. Fortunately, there were only two, if there were more, they could be compared with foreign "sharpshooters".

The end of the year is approaching, and it is the time when bandits are rampant. The security authorities should pay special attention!

### VETERANS

— XIAO ZHI

The veterans in the wounded soldiers' hospital only receive 100 yuan for vegetable expenses and 200 yuan for pork and nutrition expenses every day. Three meals a day, 100 yuan per meal, what can they buy to maintain their nutrition!

### Love the Country, Respect the National Flag

— Wu Daquan

In Shanghai, whenever a new store opens, it is customary to put up a national flag, a red glow, full of joy, considered an auspicious start.

This time, with the opening of the United Bazaar, it couldn't escape this custom either. Moreover, because the bazaar is called "United," the number of stores is more than just one. Therefore, the national flags hoisted were also more than one, fluttering in the wind, a grand sight. Regardless of Japanese rain, there are no taboos.

If the United Bazaar were promoting domestic goods, then hoisting a dozen or so national flags could be justified on the grounds of advocating for domestic products. However, using the national flag as a mere decoration for a commercial place always feels a little inappropriate.

The national flag is the symbol of a country, representing the nation. It should not be misused, and should be diligently respected and cherished. However, most Chinese people are casual and careless about their own national flag. No wonder traitors even use the national flag to be buried with them.

Various Matters

### "Sai Jinhua"

— Da Bing

A group of local "notables" in Beiping, in order to collect anecdotes about Sai Jinhua's life, specially advertised in newspapers to find Sai's former old maid, Gu Jiangshi. Recently, a certain organization conducted a poverty relief survey and discovered that this 66-year-old former maid of a famous courtesan had fallen into destitution and was in dire circumstances. Currently, the "notables" have launched a large-scale relief effort to aid in the "research" work. The "notables'" elegant interests are indeed profound! We deeply cheer for the salvation of a dying old woman!

### "The Heist of the Treasury"

— Ye Cao

The new Hollywood movie "The Heist of the Treasury" narrates the adventurous experiences of a thief, its main theme being to showcase the "international" effort to prohibit the trafficking of narcotics. Columbia Pictures will use Shanghai as the backdrop for the film. The film plans to shoot scenes of "The Bund," "the old Public Concession streetscape," "the vicinity of the old Japanese Consulate," and "several shots will focus on rickshaw sheds." Wait and see, the magnificent scenery of the grand city of Shanghai will soon be unfolded before the eyes of people all over the world!

### "The Most Precious Thing in the World"

— Sui

Reports say that recently, merchant ships sailing from Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other northern ports have been smuggling drugs. Those who are aware and provide shelter can receive a cut of the profits. It is said that the "liaison fee" for each large ship to avoid inspection is one million yuan, while for smaller ships, it ranges from 100,000 to 300,000 yuan. Therefore, after the drugs arrive at the port, they can remain safe and sound. Money! Money! The most precious thing in the world. With you, everything is settled!

### "Safety"

— Liu

Philippine Airlines is launching direct flights from Shanghai to Manila and San Francisco. The advertisement in the newspaper touts three major features. Under the "Safety" section, it says "All American flight crew." But if we try to read the list of the crew who died in the recent China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane crash, what would we think?

### After "Abstention"

— Nan

The Atomic Energy Commission has passed the United States' proposal and has submitted the report to the Security Council. According to the United States' proposal, an international organization should be established to control atomic energy and be given great power to supervise whether countries are using atomic energy appropriately. Major powers in this international organization should not use the "veto power." When punishing countries that violate the atomic treaty, it is not necessary to obtain unanimous consent from all countries. The Soviet Union naturally opposes the removal of the "veto power" and is especially strongly opposed to establishing a supervisory system, fearing that someone will discover the secrets within its country. However, when the Atomic Energy Commission voted on the United States' proposal, it did not directly and frankly cast a vote of opposition, but rather lukewarmly abstained. Abstention? This implies a lot, and perhaps many good shows will be staged from this "abstention."

### Legacy of the Imperialist Era

— Nan

Just as the new year begins, Vietnam is staging a full-scale martial performance. One moment, the Viet Minh forces bombard Hanoi, the next, the French government declares a military solution, then French reinforcements arrive in Saigon, then French officials arrive in Vietnam to investigate, then the French government declares a military solution again, and then there are reports of peace negotiations… a tortuous process, truly exhausting the ability to twist and change. Everyone knows that the Blum Cabinet is quite progressive and is a transitional government with a term of only a few weeks. Now it is actually doing this in Vietnam, which is somewhat unexpected. France, on the one hand, constantly shouts about progress, but on the other hand, still longs for the legacy of the imperialist era. The demonstration of human selfishness is most nakedly expressed in this place.

### Why the Misfortune of Being Born into an Imperial Family?

— Nan

The love story between Princess Elizabeth, the heir to the British throne, and Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, was previously rumored for a while, but now it is in full swing. The British Cabinet recently held a special meeting to discuss the princess's lifelong affair and decided to consult with the various dominions of the British Empire, as carefully as possible. But the future is uncertain. If unfortunately, it suffers a setback, and her heart is broken, how will she handle herself? Will she follow in the footsteps of the Duke of Windsor and sacrifice everything for love? Or will she reluctantly comply with the national code? The love of a royal daughter is not as free as that of a commoner's daughter. The "above all" love is actually enslaved by politics. Is this a tradition that should be maintained or an outdated custom that needs to be reformed? "Why the misfortune of being born into an imperial family?"
