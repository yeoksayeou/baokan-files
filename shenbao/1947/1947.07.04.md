### The State Council Will Decide on Important Matters to Clarify the Situation and Expedite the Suppression of the Rebellion; Mobilizing the Entire Country to Implement Wartime Rituals

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The central government has decided to strengthen the military suppression of the communists, clarify the current situation. An important proposal will be presented at the sixth State Council meeting at 9:00 AM on the 4th, which will be personally presided over by Chairman Chiang, to demonstrate to the country, concentrate forces, and achieve complete success. This proposal has been drafted after days of consultation and study by various parties. At 6:00 PM on the 3rd, Chairman Chiang summoned the presidents of the five Yuan, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, and five others to his official residence for final discussions on the contents of the proposal, which lasted until 7:30 PM. It is reported that the proposal stipulates a national mobilization to concentrate forces and implement a wartime system in order to end the rebellion as soon as possible. Once the State Council approves it, it will be formally announced. The implementation methods will be drafted by the relevant departments in charge. For example, the collection of military grain will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Food, and conscription will be the responsibility of the Ministry of National Defense. This proposal is actually similar to a general mobilization order. Sun Ke hosted a banquet for responsible persons from the Min and Qing parties on the evening of the 3rd, during which Wu Dingchang took out the original text of the proposal for them to review, and they had no objection to it. According to a responsible person from the government, the government's attitude towards suppressing the rebellion has already been seen in the clear order issued on the 2nd to commend the defending troops in the Siping campaign. It seems that there is no need to issue a proclamation at this time.

The Three Parties' Nomination and Election Method Will be Discussed by a Small Group

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a grand meeting at 8:00 PM on the 3rd, where Sun Ke hosted a banquet for important figures from the Min and Qing parties to discuss election issues. Those present included Hu Haimen, Ji Yiqiao, Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Wang Shixian, and others from the Min and Qing parties, as well as Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, Bu Lizi, and 21 others from the government. During the meeting, members of the Min and Qing parties proposed a method for the three parties to jointly nominate candidates. Some expressed opposition, but after discussion, it was decided that each of the three parties would nominate three people to form a nine-person small group to discuss the nomination method and procedures. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Yu Jiaju, a government official from the Youth Party, told reporters on the 3rd that the necessary conditions for clarifying local politics should be the separation of military and civil administration and military-civilian cooperation. The former means that the limits of military and political power should also be clearly defined in the war zone, the prestige of administrative officials should be enhanced, and military personnel should not interfere in administration, so that politics will naturally be clear and progress gradually. The latter means that military personnel should strengthen training and be sure to cherish the people, so as to achieve military-civilian cooperation. Yu said that the Communist Party has two characteristics: one is to find ways to weaken national strength in various aspects, and the other is absolute exclusiveness, so it is extremely difficult to cooperate with them. When asked by reporters about the State Council meeting on the 4th, which would present a proposal expressing its attitude towards the Communist Party, what were the Youth Party's opinions? Yu believed that it should include the following points: (1) The attitude of being forced to fight, stating that it is impossible to achieve cooperation with the Communist Party through peaceful means, and it is not that the government is unwilling to seek a solution through political means, but that it is impossible to obtain a solution through political means. (2) In non-war zones, full attention should be paid to clarifying local politics and strengthening economic construction so that people's lives can be stabilized. (3) The general public is afraid of the state of war, so it should be explained that efforts should be made to avoid increasing the people's pain and burden, and conscription and grain collection should be avoided as much as possible. Yu believed that it was necessary for the government to formally express its attitude and inform the people to boost military morale, but there was no need to issue an order to attack.

### Loyal and Courageous Struggle to Ensure the Famous City; The Chairman Sends a Telegram to Encourage All Officers and Soldiers; Chen Mingren Grows a Beard to Commemorate the Siping Campaign

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] This time in the battle of Siping, thanks to the loyalty, courage, determination, and hard struggle of our officers and soldiers, we were able to repel the stubborn enemy and ensure the famous city, adding a glorious page to the history of the revolution. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to encourage all officers and soldiers: Director Xiong, Commander Du, forwarding to Army Commander Chen of Siping Street, Chairman Liu, and forwarding to Deputy Army Commanders Chen and Chen, Chief of Staff Ma, Director Wu of the Political Department, Division Commanders Xiong, Peng, Zhao, and Song, each Deputy Division Commander, Chief of Staff, each Division Political Department Director, each Regiment, Battalion, Company, Platoon Leader, and all combat officers and soldiers: All comrades, risking your lives, for the Party and the country, for the cause, fought bravely and fiercely for eighteen days and nights, carrying forward the spirit of the Whampoa Revolution, sparing no sacrifice to the end, defending the territory, vowing to coexist and die together, your loyal hearts and blood can move even ghosts and gods, and have won God's blessing, finally enabling our Siping to turn from danger to safety. The spirits of our Founder, martyrs, and fallen soldiers are also comforted. I was overjoyed to hear the news of the relief. I do not know the actual number of our officers and soldiers killed and wounded. I hope you will quickly investigate and report so that we can provide condolences, and thoroughly investigate and report the meritorious officers and soldiers of each unit so that we can quickly issue awards and commendations for their special achievements. I also hope that you will report in detail the losses and casualties of the local people.

[United Press, Siping Street, 3rd] Army Commander Chen Mingren, a native of Hunan, is 48 years old, strong, gentle, and has a beautiful beard. On the 3rd, he solemnly told reporters: "In the past 20 days, I have not had time to shave, so I have grown this. Now I will permanently keep it as a souvenir of the Siping Street campaign." The 71st Army was the first national army to receive American equipment based on the Lend-Lease Act. Of the nine battalions under the 87th Division, only four remain. The southeast of the city is now defended by the 54th Division, the northwest is defended by the 87th Division, and the northeast is defended by the 88th Division. In addition, there is a security team of 1,000 people.

### Zhao Jiaxiang Predicts: The Situation in Northeast China

Will Turn into an International Conflict

[United Press, Shenyang, 3rd] Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command, told a United Press reporter on the 3rd that the struggle in Northeast China is a Soviet attempt to seize the area under the guise of a Chinese civil war. He predicted that within a year, this would turn into an international conflict. He attacked Soviet officers for commanding the Communist army in the battle of Siping. He said that the vast Shenyang Arsenal, which was moved by the Soviet Union, was not moved to the Soviet Union, but rebuilt in the Northeast, near the Sino-Soviet border, to manufacture weapons for the CCP. Other machines taken by the Soviet Union in Dalian were handed over to the CCP to manufacture mines and hand grenades. Zhao compared the current struggle in the Northeast to Japan's previous occupation of the area. He said: "The new Japanese" are smarter than the old Japanese because the old Japanese failed to conceal their imperialist ambitions. "However, bear paws are a delicacy in the Northeast. If they do not retreat, we will eat them."

Zhao said that the National Army will spare no sacrifice to defend the Northeast, and pointed out that three years after the Sino-Japanese War, other countries also began to be involved in the vortex of war. "The same situation will happen this time."

He attacked Lieutenant General Saito, former Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who is now a military adviser to Lin Biao, commander of the Communist Northeast Army. He said that this information, as well as information that Soviet officers assisted the Communist army in the battle of Siping, was learned by General Chen Mingren, the National Army commander who defended Siping Street, from captured Communist soldiers. Zhao also said that the battle of Siping Street was a "turning point" in the current campaign, and claimed that the Communist Party suffered 25,000 deaths and 25,000 injuries in this battle, while the National Army's losses were only 4,000 deaths and 11,000 injuries. He admitted that the National Army was facing severe pressure in the Northeast, but was determined to hold its current positions. Zhao declared: "Now the National Army is winning in both offense and defense." When the reporter suggested that he might be overemphasizing the Soviet Union's role in the Northeast conflict, because most of the Communist army was made up of Chinese who had been fighting the Kuomintang for many years, Zhao replied: "In the past, there were also many Chinese who fought on the side of the Japanese."

### The National Army Changes Strategy to Capture the Main Force of the Communist Army

[Our Changchun Office, 3rd] According to military observers here, the National Army has decided to change its strategy and take the initiative from now on. Depending on the progress, it will go beyond the recovered areas and capture the main force of the Communist army in order to annihilate them and seek long-term stability. Although the Communist army suffered a major blow in the Siping campaign, its remnants are still lurking and fleeing around Jilin and Changchun, as well as along the Pingmei and Jihai lines, breaking up into smaller units to maneuver with the National Army. Therefore, the Northeast war has changed from large-scale battles to hunting down the dispersed forces of the Communist army. The Communist army's defeat this time is different from the past in that they did not flee north across the river in panic. We are very optimistic about the future of the war, but we must not be negligent due to optimism. The Communist army's continuous supply of ammunition during this major battle makes us realize the need to be vigilant.

The left-wing troops pressed on the Pingmei Line. There is still fighting near Weiyuanbao, northeast of Kaiyuan. The Communist army, which collapsed from the outskirts of Siping, increased its forces on both sides of the China Chang Railway, in Huaide and Yitong. There was a fierce battle at Daheilinzi, northwest of Gongzhuling. The National Army has made progress, advancing in separate directions towards Yilian. The central route arrived at Chenjiatun, 20 kilometers north of Yitong, on the morning of the 3rd. The Communist army stubbornly resisted in Yitong and its northwest area.

### The Communist Army Cuts Off the Jiaodong Corridor; The War Situation in Shandong Enters a New Stage; Wang Yaowu's Troops Move South and Enter Linqu

[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] He Siyuan, the mayor of Beiping, gave a special analysis of the current situation in Shandong at a press conference on the 3rd, based on his many years of experience in guerrilla warfare in Shandong. He said that the National Army has completely controlled the favorable conditions in Shandong. The base areas cultivated by the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains in central Shandong for many years have been occupied by the National Army in Nanma, Lucun, Yuezhuang, and Donglidian, and the Communist army has had to withdraw from central Shandong.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 3rd] After the center of gravity of the war in central Shandong shifted to the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, the war situation in Shandong has entered a new stage. After the National Army in the central Shandong mountainous area recovered Donglidian and Yuezhuang, the nerve center of the Communist East China Military Region, on the 2nd, it continued to march towards Linqu by moonlight. The National Army under Wang Yaowu, which went south from Weixian and Changle, entered Linqu at noon on the 3rd. The Communist army fled northwestward. At 7:00 PM, the vanguard of the National Army, which went north from Yuezhuang, had joined forces with Wang Yaowu's troops.

In the Nanma area, the National Army seized more than 1,000 boxes of shells and more than 5 million rounds of ammunition, as well as countless Western medicines and food. More than 300 Communist soldiers surrendered voluntarily south of Nanma on the 2nd.

[Our Linyi Office, 3rd] The bloody battles in Yuezhuang, Shiqiao, and Donglidian in the Yishan Mountains are becoming increasingly fierce. The two armies entered and exited Donglidian no less than 30 times, and Yuezhuang more than 10 times. The Communist army set up defenses all over the mountains and buried mines everywhere. All mountains and villages must be resisted to the death. In order to eliminate its main force, the Feng Army adopted a steady encirclement and attack strategy. As of noon on the 3rd, the fighting was still fierce. In order to take the initiative, in addition to leaving four columns on the front of the mountainous area to resist gradually, the Communist army also sneaked two columns to Tianmashan in the southeast of Mengyin, attempting to disturb the rear of the National Army. After being encircled and attacked by the National Army, one of the columns broke through and sneaked to the vicinity of Mengyin on the 2nd. Its 7th Column and the original 5th and 6th Columns, based in Yi and Ju, also sneaked around the outskirts of Linyi and are being attacked by the National Army in separate directions.

The passengers were able to get off the plane safely and avoid a calamity.

### Repair and Defense Work Cannot Proceed; The Yellow River is in Danger of Breaching; The Communist Army in Hebei is Also Harassing the River Construction Area

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Communist army is destroying the agreement and hindering the restoration of the Yellow River dike. Liu Bocheng's troops are crossing the river on a large scale, causing the river construction to be unable to proceed, and there is a danger of a serious breach at any time. The reporter visited Xue Dubi, Minister of Water Resources, on the 3rd. According to him, "After the repair and defense agreement was signed, the government solemnly sent personnel to Bian to negotiate a ceasefire agreement with the Communist Party. Who knew that Ye Nanfu, the representative of the Ministry of National Defense, had just arrived in Bian, and the Communist army had already crossed the river south, with no credibility at all. The dike problem is now extremely serious. The Ministry of Water Resources is doing its best to carry out the project. As long as the Communist army does not come, we will use one minute to engage in the project. However, the current situation is obviously beyond the capacity of the Ministry of Water Resources and requires the cooperation of military defense and river defense." Xue has repeatedly consulted with Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense, and other people in recent days, asking them to quickly clear the Communist army on the south bank of the Yellow River. On the 3rd, he also wrote to Minister Bai and Chief of Staff Chen to reiterate his intentions. It is reported that the Ministry of National Defense indicated that it could transfer reinforcements to go there.

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Following the harassment and obstruction of the Yellow River restoration project by the Communist army in Dongkou, the Communist army in Hebei is also harassing the river construction area. Liuzhuang and Gao Village on the Yellow River dike in Hebei have always been dangerous sections.

Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM on the 1st, the Communist army suddenly invaded and occupied them. The Hebei Repair and Defense Office immediately took emergency measures, ordering the Liu Zhuang flood fighting and dike restoration team to temporarily guard Shang Village, and ordering Wang Ziqian, the leader of the Third Engineering Team, to lead 50 team members, together with flood soldiers, to protect it at risk. The other engineering teams 1, 2, and 5 were temporarily transferred to work at Mao Dian.

[Our Yanzhou Office, 3rd] The Liu Bocheng's troops, who secretly crossed the Yellow River from western Shandong, had increased to 30,000 people by the 2nd, sneaking from Dongkou Linpuji towards Yuncheng and Heze. By noon on the 3rd, they had been blocked by the National Army on the line of Shifanzhuang west of Yuncheng and Luzhuang Fantun northwest of Heze. In addition, the local Communist army team of 5,000 people, which had originally sneaked into the Yejun northwest of Dongping, also sneaked between Wenshang and Yuncheng. An observer said that this battle in western Shandong would not affect the war in the Yimeng Mountains. A new force of the National Army has arrived and it will not be difficult to quell it.

### Secretary Marshall Declares to Reporters the Reason for the US Sale of Arms to China; Refuses to Comment on the China Policy Issue

[US Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Marshall held a press conference on the 2nd. When reporters asked about the recent sale of arms to China, Secretary Marshall replied that the lifting of the restrictions on transportation costs to China did not mean that the United States intended to support the Chinese government in its civil war. Secretary Marshall said that this sale of arms to China was only an independent action in itself and was not enough to symbolize a policy. Part of this type of arms is not suitable for US equipment, but only suitable for the Chinese-made Zhongzheng rifle.

Export licenses for transport aircraft and aircraft parts have also been signed, and the transportation of this arms is part of this action.

### Heavy Losses After the Plunder of Sipingjie and Gongzhuling; Liu Handong Appeals for Relief for the Survivors

[Report from our Beiping Office, 3rd] Due to the war, the loss of soybeans transported from the Northeast is estimated to be over several billions. The area between Shenyang and Changchun along the Middle East Railway is a major soybean-producing region. After the victory, the China Trust Bureau, various financial institutions, businesses, and grain merchants flocked to the area to purchase soybeans at various stations along the Middle East Railway for export to earn foreign exchange, or to sell them within the country for profit. Before the war clouds loomed over the Northeast, the soybeans transported from Gongzhuling, Sipingjie, Changtu, and Kaiyuan were piled up like mountains. However, after the war spread, some were burned and some were lost. The estimated loss is over ten billion yuan. It is said that a certain commercial institution in Beiping invested all the profits it had made after the victory in purchasing soybeans in the Northeast. This war has caused it significant losses.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] According to an investigation by relevant authorities, Gongzhuling suffered severe losses during the forty days it was occupied and then retreated from by the Communist army. Statistical reports include the coal, horses, and food that were taken away, as well as the factories, school buildings, and transportation and communication equipment that were destroyed. The estimated loss is over ten billion yuan at current prices.

[Central News Agency, Siping, 3rd] After the news that the National Government had issued a clear order to commend the military and civilians who defended Siping reached here, all the military and civilians in the city were greatly excited, forgetting the fatigue of the 20-day and night bloody battle, and their spirits were lifted. Director Xiong, Commander Du, and the Liaoning Troop慰勞団 have allocated a total of 70 million yuan in circulating currency. In addition, a large number of cigarettes and canned goods were brought by plane and distributed to the military and civilians defending the city to express their condolences. Siping is currently without water and electricity, becoming a dry, parched, black, tattered, and filthy city. Decaying corpses have not yet been buried, and the stench is overflowing, raising concerns about epidemics. The Northeast Headquarters has dispatched a health team to carry out disinfection and vaccination work. Chairman Liu Handong told reporters on the 3rd: This province has been completely lost, and no county or city has been spared. The whereabouts of the county magistrates of Changtu and Xi’an are still unknown. The reconstruction of various levels of government, the restoration of education and culture, the care of refugees, the revitalization of economic construction, and the prevention and control of famine and epidemics require human, material, and financial resources that are beyond the capacity of this province after such a catastrophe. It is hoped that people across the country will be concerned about the disaster victims and work together to provide assistance so that the four million survivors of Liaobei Province will no longer suffer from the threat of famine and epidemics.

A Grand慰勞會 Held in Shenyang

All Circles Celebrate Siping Victory

[Central News Agency, Jiyang, 2nd] The Northeast慰勞団 held a grand慰勞會 at the municipal government square here on the 2nd to慰問 the military and civilians. At the same time, all circles in Shenyang took this opportunity to celebrate the Siping Victory Conference. More than 50,000 military and civilians participated.团长傅汝霖 delivered a speech, stating: The military and civilians in the Northeast are in extremely difficult circumstances, and the Central Government is very concerned. The purpose of this团 is to convey the Central Government's intentions and慰勞 the military and civilians. The Northeast is geographically important to our future. Our government fought for the Northeast, and the Second World War also started from there. The security of the Northeast affects the world, so defending the security of the Northeast is also defending the security of the world. He expressed his deep joy at the victory of Siping. He also stated: Those who use foreign aid to create chaos will ultimately fail. He finally encouraged all the military and civilians to unite sincerely and continue to struggle so that order in the Northeast could be restored as soon as possible. Deputy团长钱公来 also delivered a speech. Military and civilian representatives Dong Yanping, Zhao Jiaxiang, and Shenyang City Councilor Zhang Baozi delivered speeches in response, hoping that the spirit of military-civilian cooperation would create an iron Shenyang. He also pointed out that the Siping campaign was of great importance to the war situation in the Northeast, and hoped that the victory would be expanded in the future to recover the entire Northeast. Zhao emphasized the need to recognize the current significance of the war, which is to "overthrow the running dogs of imperialism." He then said: In celebrating the victory of Siping, we should continue to promote the revolutionary spirit, eliminate the rebellion, and recover the Northeast. He also suggested that we observe a minute of silence for the military and civilians who died in Siping.

### Linked Import and Export Measures; National Economic Commission Continued Review Yesterday; Decision to Reduce Overly Large Institutions

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The National Economic Commission continued to hold a plenary review meeting in the afternoon of the 3rd to discuss economic reform plans. After four hours of discussion, careful studies and revisions were made to the various aspects of the plan related to agriculture, industry, commerce, finance, food, and transportation. It was also decided that Xiao Zheng would be the convener of the review and organization of the "Finance and Guiding Idle Funds" section, and Xu Baiyuan would be the convener of the review and organization of the finance section. Today's meeting was chaired by Xu Kan, and more than 20 people attended, including Weng Wenhao, Zhang Jia'ao, Yu Hongjun, and Chen Qitian. First, Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, and Tan Boyu each gave a work report, and then the discussion began. The most important of these was the linked import and export licensing method. Many of the committee members disagreed with this method, believing that it would easily lead to abuses if implemented suddenly at the present time. For example, some imported goods are subject to U.S. export restrictions, while goods that the U.S. can export are often restricted from import by us. Since we do not fully adopt liberalism for imports and exports, it is naturally difficult to implement linking. Furthermore, foreign exchange settlement is also a difficult point. If the job is not completely taken as a solution, then foreign exchange settlement is necessary. If it is based on the official price, it will definitely not be what the merchants want. If it is based on the black market price, the government will have difficulty accepting it. It was decided that the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Affairs would draft a method and then decide.

When discussing industrial policy, Weng Wenhao disagreed with the original plan's proposal that "industrial construction should be located as much as possible in places where fuel and raw materials are cheap," believing that this method could not meet future construction needs and should be revised. Jian Guan'san suggested that the country be divided into several major industrial zones based on national defense and people's livelihood needs and resource distribution, and this opinion should be included in the plan. Other committee members made many suggestions for revision and debate, so it was decided that Weng Wenhao would convene Chen Qitian, Pan Xulun, Deng Feihuang, and others to review and revise the plan with reference to the first phase of economic principles and the opinions expressed by the committee members. Regarding the collection of public and private banks to form a Reconstruction Finance Corporation to invest in long-term industrial and mining construction, and to use overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange funds deposited abroad to invest in the company to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad, there was a fierce debate on both sides. As a result, it was decided that those whose purpose is to invest in industrial and mining construction projects could be established. At the meeting, it was also discussed which railways were main lines and which were branch lines. The main lines would be operated by the central government with all its strength, and branch lines would be permitted under the central government's management system, and local and private operations would be encouraged.

After Tan Boyu explained, the meeting passed the proposal according to the Ministry of Communications' opinion. Regarding the simplification of tax collection, Liu Zhendong and others believed that merchants often used this as an excuse to make demands in order to achieve the purpose of delaying or reducing payments, and it was decided to delete the item of simplifying tax collection.

The general budget group and the financial group of the committee passed the following major cases at a joint meeting on the morning of the 3rd: (1) In order to save national expenditures, overly large institutions should be reduced and downsized. (2) The treatment of employees of state-owned and public-owned enterprises and banks should be consistent with that of public, educational, and military personnel in general, in order to be fair, and to study ways to improve the treatment of public, educational, and military personnel in order to achieve uniformity.

### An Important Page in Constitutional History; Increase in the Number of Reporter Legislators; Legislative Yuan Resolves to Increase from Two to Five

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 5th] The Legislative Yuan held its 331st regular meeting on the morning of the 3rd, with President Sun兼 presiding. More than 80 legislators attended and passed the following major cases: (1) Revised Regulations on Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax. (2) Revised Article 51, Paragraph 3 of the Distant Police Penalty Law. (3) Smuggling Punishment Ordinance. (4) Revised Article 25 and Article 32 of the War Criminals Trial Ordinance. (5) Revised Article 4 of the China Farmers Bank Land Bond Law (the face value of land bonds is divided into three types: 50,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan). (6) The Criminal Law Committee reported on the review of whether the term of the Regulations on Criminal Cases of U.S. Military Personnel in China could be extended until the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops. It was decided to pass the review as per the constitutional opinion (revised Article 7 of the Regulations on Handling Criminal Cases of U.S. Military Personnel in China. This regulation will be implemented from the date of promulgation, and its validity period will be until the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops). (7) Revised Article 17 and Article 18 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Opium and Drug Prohibition, and revised Article 3 of the Regulations on Special Criminal Case Proceedings. (8) Distribution Table of Legislative Yuan Members Elected by Occupational Groups. (9) Committee member Zhao Pei and others requested that the number of Legislative Yuan members from Tibet be increased by two and allocated to the Tibetan ethnic group in Qinghai. (10) Distribution Table of National Assembly Women Representatives. It was decided to return to the review and determine the principle that in the 168 places for women's group representatives in the National Assembly, the basic number for each province and city should account for two places, and the representatives of national women's groups should account for 20 places. The remainder will be allocated to provinces and cities based on population. In addition, five budget proposals were passed. The meeting started at 9:30 a.m. and adjourned at 12:30 p.m., and it was scheduled to reconvene at 4:00 p.m. on the 4th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Regarding the issue of the number of reporter representatives from the Legislative Yuan, which concerns reporter participation in politics, when it was raised at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 3rd, Lai Chenxun argued on the basis of reason, and Chen Haicheng and Zhong Tianxin spoke out righteously, with the support of President Sun. It was decided that, according to the temporary motion proposed by Chen Xunxin, the number of representatives of free professions would be increased from the original 10 to 15, and the number of reporter representatives would also be increased from the originally allocated two to five. This matter is of great significance to the press in the future, as it will use its detached position to promote democracy and advocate constitutionalism. It not only establishes a new milestone in the history of journalism, but also an important page in constitutional history.

### Journalists Have Great Responsibility at the Beginning of Constitutional Governance

This case was proposed based on the "Distribution Table of the Number of Occupational Representatives in the Legislative Yuan". After Liu Ke, Chairman of the Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee, reported on the review process, Situ De and Liu Youchen spoke successively, pointing out valuable opinions on the distribution of the number of industrial and commercial groups in the distribution table of occupational representatives in the Legislative Yuan. Chen Xun念 then spoke. Chen had proposed a temporary motion today co-signed by 22 legislators, suggesting increasing the number of representatives of free professions and increasing the proportion of reporter representatives to 6%, from two to five.

When Chen explained this proposal, he said: According to the review committee's distribution of 84 occupational representatives, the 10 representatives of free professions only account for 11.9% of the total, which seems too few. And these 10 places must be further distributed by five units: journalists, lawyers, accountants, technicians, and medical groups. The Department of Social Affairs will determine the detailed allocation in the future. However, the department's figures are based on statistics before April, which show that there are only 3,000 members of press groups. In fact, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places are not included. According to our estimates, the total number of press group members nationwide should be more than 30,000. The number of 3,000 is not accurate. According to this distribution, the proportion of Legislative Yuan members is inaccurate. Chen also pointed out that according to previous regulations, educational groups originally belonged to the category of free professions. Now, they have been specially singled out. This is a measure to respect education, and the intention is very good. However, after this change, the number of educational groups has increased sharply from 6% of the original total to 20%, an increase of nearly three times, which should be reconsidered. Chen said in an impassioned tone: During the Anti-Japanese War, journalists followed the government and moved to the rear. They made great contributions by engaging in reporting amidst gunfire. At the beginning of this constitutional governance, we need journalists who know the hardships of the people to fulfill their responsibility to promote democracy and advocate constitutionalism. At present, free professions only have 10 members of the Legislative Yuan, and reporters account for at most two. Considering the number of reporters nationwide and their responsibilities, it seems too few. Therefore, I propose a temporary motion to increase the number of reporter groups to 6% and clearly stipulate this in the item of free professional groups. As for the total number of free professional groups, please increase it from 11.9% to 18%.

### President and Legislators Speak in Support of Journalists

After Chen finished speaking, Chen Ruxuan and others rose to speak, expressing their agreement with his suggestion. Chen Ruxuan believes that free professions are important, and the number of representatives should be increased. He also pointed out that it is unfair to use the number of people as the allocation standard. However, it is also unfair to use units as the standard. The best way is to determine the number of places based on the current contribution of the group to the country and society and the needs of the future. Our country is founded on agriculture and built on industry. Agricultural and industrial groups should have more places. Free professions only have 10 representatives, and they must be distributed among five units: lawyers, accountants, technicians, journalists, and medical groups, so the number should be appropriately increased.

Chen Haicheng also took the same view, pointing out that representatives of various industries are often limited to the interests of their own industries, and often only seek development for themselves. Journalists also have their concerns, but what they are concerned about is only how freedom of speech is not restricted, and they have no other vested interests. Those who are elected must be experienced people, and they will be able to take care of all corners with their objective, calm, and fair minds. Reporters are familiar with the interests of all classes, and they can play a coordinating role in the Legislative Yuan in the future. The current regulations only stipulate that journalists elect two representatives, which should be considered. Chen Zhangsheng suggested that the increased number of places for journalists should be drawn from the 20% of educational groups. The Legislative Yuan holds meetings for eight months a year, and there are various review committees. If educational representatives take care of their positions, they will inevitably fail to attend meetings, and it is difficult to take care of both. The number of educational representatives should be increased, but the increase should not be so large, and a part of the total proportion they occupy should be given to the journalists.

President Sun兼 rose to speak, also believing that free professional groups have the most sound organization and the least number of places, which is worth considering. He also pointed out that among the professional groups nationwide, the organization of farmers' associations is the worst, but they have the most places, accounting for 24 out of 84. In the future, they will inevitably be manipulated by non-genuine farmers and should be reduced.

Zhong Tianxin, a "friend of journalists", spoke, believing that the original intention of increasing the number of educational groups was only to express respect for education. However, the so-called education cannot be limited to schools. If its scope is expanded, newspapers should also be respected. The influence of today's newspapers on society is definitely not less than that of schools. Therefore, if the number of places is increased to respect education, the number of free professions and journalists should not only be increased, but the educational groups should be limited to a maximum of 12 places, and the remaining five places should be allocated to free professions. The number of places for journalists should be increased by three, from the original two to five.

### I Will Reiterate the Ban on Foreign Aircraft Intrusion

Navigation Restriction Regulations Are Being Drafted

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] In order to protect the sovereignty of its airspace, the government will reiterate the ban on foreign aircraft arbitrarily intruding into our country's airspace. The Navigation Restriction Regulations are being presided over by Fei Zhenqiu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of National Defense, together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and relevant units, to determine the principles, and the draft can be completed in the short term.

### Decision on the Allocation of the Number of Occupational Group Legislators

After discussing for more than an hour, Chuantong Xian, Situ De and others suggested first deciding on some principles. Chen Guyuan also assumed an allocation ratio, namely 18 for agricultural groups, 18 for industrial groups, 3 for fishing groups, 16 for industrial and commercial groups, 13 for education, and 16 for free professions.

At this point, President Sun兼 rose to speak again, pointing out that according to our country's traditional concept, scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants have always been equally important. When we discuss the allocation of the number of occupational representatives of the Legislative Yuan today, we should not base it on population or region, but on its importance to the country and society. A basic allocation can now be made to divide the various occupations into five major groups: agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and free professions. Each group will receive 15 places, totaling 75 places, plus 3 places for the fishing industry, totaling 78 places. Only 6 places remain unallocated and can be divided into agricultural and industrial groups. Chen Guyuan advocated that each of the industrial and agricultural groups increase by three places.

The meeting voted on this opinion, and it was passed by a majority, with 18 for agriculture, 18 for industry, 3 for fishing, 5 for commerce, 10 for industry and mining, 15 for education, and 15 for free professions. The number of women who should occupy among these 84 places was then discussed. According to the original proposal, there were only eight female representatives. After Fu Yan's efforts, it was decided to increase it to ten. However, there were different views on how to allocate it at the meeting. Chuan Yan believed that there should be female representatives for accountants, lawyers, and journalists. However, other committee members believed that they should be added to educational groups. Finally, it was decided that there would be two female representatives from agricultural groups, three from industrial groups, three from education, and two from free professions (one lawyer and one doctor), for a total of ten.

Finally, the distribution table of the number of free professions was discussed. All agreed that the list of original proposals made by Chen Xunlian was fair and passed the proposal without objection, namely five journalists, four medical groups (one woman), three lawyers (one woman), two technicians, and one accountant, for a total of 15.

When this case was discussed today, more than 30 committee members spoke, and almost all supported this request from journalists. After the meeting adjourned, the committee members congratulated the reporters in the audience.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] It is reported that the press has decided to compete in occupational groups, including Cheng Cangbo, President of the Xinwen Bao, Chen Bosheng, Editor-in-Chief of the Central News Agency, Chen Xunxi, Editor-in-Chief of the Shen Bao, Huang Shaogu, President of the Heping Daily, and Hu Jianzhong, President of the Southeast Daily.

### Five More Legislative Yuan Members from Tibet

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Legislative Yuan discussed the case proposed by committee member Zhao Pei and others to increase the number of Legislative Yuan members from Tibet by two and allocate them to the Tibetan ethnic group in Qinghai on the 3rd. It was decided to pass the review opinion and increase the number of Legislative Yuan members from Tibet by two. The Distribution Table of the Number of Legislative Yuan Members from Tibet and Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law were amended together. The following is recorded: (A) Amended Article 4 of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law, the number of Legislative Yuan members is as follows: (1) From each province and directly administered municipality, those with a population of 3 million or less, 5 places, those with a population of more than 3 million, one additional member for every 1 million people. (2) Those elected by the leagues and banners of Mongolia, a total of 22 places. (3) Those elected by Tibet, a total of 15 places. (4) Those elected by various ethnic groups in the border areas, a total of 6 places. (5) Those elected by nationals residing abroad, a total of 19 places. (6) Those elected by occupational groups, a total of 84 places. The allocation of the number of places in each of the preceding paragraphs shall be determined separately by law. (B) Distribution Table of the Number of Legislative Yuan Members from Tibet: (1) 5 places in the Xicang area, including one woman. (2) 5 places for Tibetans temporarily residing in the interior. (3) 5 places for Tibetan people in the province, 2 elected in Qinghai, 2 elected in Xikang, and 1 elected in Gansu.

### Discussion on the Allocation of the Number of Women Representatives in the National Assembly; An Interesting Debate Between Male and Female Legislators

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] When the Legislative Yuan discussed the Distribution Table of the Number of Women Representatives in the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 3rd, an interesting debate occurred between male and female legislators. Although President Sun 兼's wife and female representatives such as Bao Deming and Tang Guogang attended to cheer them on, the meeting was always dominated by a one-sided atmosphere. The legislators attacked the so-called "national women's groups" to their heart's content. What was most disappointing for the women's world was that, according to the review committee's regulations, national women's groups could elect 33 representatives. The women's world believed that this was too few and requested an increase to 40 places. Unexpectedly, the result was reduced to 20 places. When this case was put to a vote, all of the more than 80 legislators, except for the five women, raised their hands, and then there was a burst of laughter. Bao Deming shouted from the audience: "Today is your men's world," her frustrated look was evident in her words, but she was unable to reverse the decline. The meeting decided that the number of women's group representatives should be based on a basic number of two, and then increased according to the population. The detailed distribution will be studied by the Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee and then submitted to the General Assembly.

### Amendments to the National Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Regulations Passed by the Legislative Yuan at the Regular Meeting on July 3rd

Article 1: All domestically produced tobacco and alcohol products shall be subject to tobacco and alcohol taxes in accordance with these regulations, unless otherwise stipulated by the commodity tax.

Article 2: The tobacco and alcohol tax is a national tax, levied by the commodity tax authorities under the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance.

Article 3: The tobacco and alcohol tax rates are stipulated as follows:

(1) Tobacco tax is divided into tobacco leaf and tobacco shreds. The tobacco leaf tax is levied at 50% of the assessed duty-paid price based on the production area, and the tobacco shred tax is levied at 30%.

(2) The alcohol tax is levied at 80% of the assessed duty-paid price based on the production area.

Tobacco leaves used for shredding in the preceding paragraph shall still be subject to tobacco leaf tax first.

Article 4: The duty-paid price of domestically produced tobacco and alcohol products shall be based on the average wholesale price in the market near the place of production within the past three months. However, if the actual wholesale price in the market exceeds or falls below 25% of the average wholesale price on which the duty-paid price is based, the Ministry of Finance may make appropriate adjustments at any time.

The average wholesale price in the preceding paragraph includes (A) the duty-paid price, (B) the original tax paid, i.e., the tax rate applicable to the duty-paid price of that category, and (C) the expenses required to transport from the place of production to the nearby market, set at 15% of the duty-paid price. The calculation formula for the duty-paid price is as follows:

Average wholesale price in the market near the place of production x 100 ÷ (100 + Tobacco and alcohol tax rate + Expenses required from the place of production to the nearby market, i.e., 15). For goods subject to domestic tobacco and alcohol taxes, in order to facilitate tax collection, the Ministry of Finance may adopt a classified and graded levy based on circumstances.

Article 5: The investigation of tobacco and alcohol sales prices, the compilation of price indices, and the assessment and revision of duty-paid prices shall be handled by the Evaluation Committee of the Tax Administration.

Article 6: Tobacco and alcohol products that have been subject to tobacco and alcohol taxes shall not be subject to any additional donations or taxes by local governments when sold domestically.

Article 7: The collection of tobacco and alcohol taxes shall be divided into the following three types, depending on the production situation:

(1) Large-scale production plants or concentrated production areas shall be subject to on-site collection by personnel dispatched by the relevant commodity tax sub-bureaus stationed in the plant or on the premises.

(2) For those where it is inconvenient to dispatch personnel to be stationed in the plant or on the premises, for tobacco shreds and alcohol, the relevant commodity tax sub-bureau shall verify the production volume and collect taxes on a monthly basis. For tobacco leaves, merchants shall report to the commodity tax authorities in the place of production and collect taxes in accordance with the law.

(3) Alcohol produced regularly in winter may be collected in installments depending on the production volume.

The standards for on-site collection in the preceding paragraph and the installments for collection of alcohol produced in winter shall be approved by the Ministry of Finance.

Article 8: The tobacco and alcohol tax shall use the duty-paid certificate issued by the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance as proof of tax payment, and the seal shall be affixed to the package or container seal. However, for retail sales of tobacco shreds and loose retail sales of alcohol where it is not possible to affix the seal, only a duty-paid certificate shall be issued.

Article 9: All merchants and brokers engaged in tobacco and alcohol shall report to the local tax collection authorities, who shall forward the application to the commodity tax authorities for approval and registration, and the bureau shall report to the Tax Administration for record.

Article 10: Tobacco and alcohol merchants and goods holders who commit any of the following acts shall have their goods confiscated by the competent collection agency and sent to the court, which shall impose a fine of up to ten times the amount of tax evaded. Criminal offenses shall be dealt with in accordance with the Criminal Law.

(1) Illicitly producing tobacco or alcohol.

(2) Illegally selling or transporting tobacco or alcohol that has not been taxed.

(3) Purchasing untaxed tobacco leaves and shredding them for sale privately.

(8) Altering or reusing duty-paid certificates, sub-transport permits, alteration certificates, or modification certificates.

(9) Failing to properly affix the seal or alteration certificate or modification certificate to the package or container.

(10) Forging duty-paid certificates, sub-transport permits, seals, alteration certificates, modification certificates, or official seals, and using them.

If the evaded tax goods in the preceding paragraph have been sold and cannot be confiscated, in addition to being punished according to law and recovering the price of the goods, the tax shall still be ordered to be supplemented.

Article 11: Tobacco and alcohol merchants and goods holders who commit any of the following acts shall be subject to a fine of up to 5,000 yuan.

(1) Failing to report in accordance with the prescribed procedures, or making false reports.

(2) Transporting and selling taxed tobacco and alcohol without reporting for inspection.

(3) Dividing or transporting taxed tobacco and alcohol to other places without obtaining a sub-transport permit.

(4) Selling taxed tobacco and alcohol in transit without the approval of the local tax collection agency.

(5) Failing to register in accordance with the regulations, or failing to report the cancellation of registration when business is suspended.

Article 12: Brokers who engage in agency sales for customers must report the quantity of transactions of both parties to the local commodity tax authorities for verification. If they conceal or fail to report, or make false reports, they shall be subject to a fine of up to 5,000 yuan. For repeat offenders, in addition to being punished, the commodity tax authorities may request the local competent authority to revoke their broker qualification depending on the severity of the circumstances.

Article 13: If those who shred tobacco leaves purchase untaxed tobacco leaves and shred them into strands, and the tobacco strands have been taxed, only the tobacco leaf portion may be punished. If the tobacco strands have also not been taxed, the tobacco leaves and tobacco strands shall be punished separately.

Article 14: For tobacco shreds and alcohol subject to production-based tax collection, and alcohol subject to installment tax payment, the taxes payable must be paid in full within the current month or installments. If the payment is overdue, the competent collection agency may transfer the case to the court for collection based on the higher tax amount at the time of the tax arrears or determination, and shall be punished in accordance with the following provisions.

(1) If the payment is overdue by more than one month, a fine of 15% of the amount of tax recovered shall be imposed.

(2) If the payment is overdue by more than two months, a fine of 30% of the amount of tax recovered shall be imposed.

Article 15: The recovery of fines and suspension of business under these regulations shall be carried out by the court by ruling.

Appeals may be filed against the preceding ruling within five days, but no further appeals shall be allowed. The court may set a deadline for the person subject to the penalty to pay the fine and the amount to be recovered, and if the payment is overdue, it shall be enforced.

Editorial

### Commemorating American Independence

Today, 171 years ago, the American colonies united thirteen states, bravely resisting the high-pressure policies of Great Britain. Although militarily they were in the darkest period, the Continental Congress issued a "Declaration of Independence" on that day, declaring that the politics of all countries should be based on the inherent rights of mankind, and that freedom and equality should be the highest guiding principles. From then on, July 4th is not only the National Day of the United States, worthy of warm celebration by the American people; but also the greatest day in modern history. For more than 170 years, the demands of all nations for independence and liberation and the demands of people in all countries for political democratization have been in full swing, and it can be said that they have been inspired and influenced by this Declaration of Independence. Therefore, every year when July 4th arrives, we not only celebrate American National Day, but also pray for the future of human freedom and equality. We look back on the past and deeply understand the difficulty of starting a business and founding a country, and we look squarely at the current international environment and feel even more that the future of mankind is full of thorns. Taking advantage of American Independence Day, we would like to express our usual expectations for the United States.

First, the United States is a newly emerging country that first awakened and rose up. In the history of modern political thought, it first revealed the inherent rights of mankind and sang the slogans of freedom and equality. Subsequently, revolutionary movements in various countries surged, demanding national liberation and independence externally, and demanding freedom and equality for the people internally. It can be said that they were the result of the influence of the American Revolution. Therefore, for more than 170 years, the American Revolution, in the United States itself, has been completely successful. The United States has not only been liberated from British rule, but none of the principles revealed in its Declaration of Independence have not been realized. Today, the United States is leading all countries in the world to work together to create world peace. But from afar, for more than 170 years, the ideals that the United States has longed for have not been fully realized. Looking at today's world, how many nations are still subject to the rule of other countries and cannot talk about freedom and equality at all; and looking at the political situation in various countries, there are also many countries where the people are still manipulated by a few people and cannot talk about democratic politics at all. The United States is in a leading position internationally, and it cannot but bear a special responsibility for world peace and the basic rights of the people. The United States should redouble its efforts to promote itself and others, so that all nations can be liberated and not controlled by any country; so that the people of all countries can enjoy the rights of freedom and equality and no longer be threatened by any totalitarian regime; in this way, people can truly believe that the United States participated in the two world wars indeed "for democracy." In order to fulfill its responsibilities, the United States government should take a long-term view of the entire world and implement a foreign policy that should not be divided into Europe and the United States, let alone Europe and Asia. We feel that the current crisis in the world lies in ideological conflicts. Although the United States is a newly emerging country with only more than 170 years of history, the thoughts of the American people are still nothing more than the two major meanings of the independence revolution—nationalism and democracy. Moreover, its longing ideals have not yet been fully realized. Therefore, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov criticized the American-style democratic politics as 18th-century democratic politics. Although this is Molotov's satire, we cannot but recognize the current hidden worries of the United States. The US authorities must be especially vigilant, face reality squarely, and maintain that the United States will always be a newly emerging country, always standing at the forefront of the times.

Second, the United States sincerely hopes that the post-war world can truly enter a new era of peace and democracy, which no one can deny; but the US government authorities are well aware of the post-war crisis, that some nations are currently being interfered with and oppressed by other countries; that the people of some countries have no freedom at all; and that world politics cannot be democratized, and there is no peace to speak of internationally. In order to help other countries resist external threats, and at the same time to help the people of other countries build democratic, unified, and powerful countries, President Truman proposed the aid bill to Greece and Turkey, which has become the Truman Doctrine known to everyone today. Weighing the Truman Doctrine from the current international situation, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, you cannot criticize it, but from the actual foreign policy of the United States, the scope of implementation of the so-called Truman Doctrine is limited to one corner of Europe. The "European Aid Plan" proposed by Secretary of State Marshall is considered by everyone to be the second chapter of the Truman Doctrine, which is a good explanation. With such generosity, it is logical that it will be unanimously welcomed by European countries and will never be distorted or accused of harboring imperialist ambitions by the United States to help other countries. Standing in the position of a third party, and speaking fairly, the misunderstandings between countries are caused by the incomplete US policies. Therefore, we cannot but tell the US government that any policy or any doctrine has its integrity and continuity, otherwise it will not become a policy or a doctrine. The best way to stop slander is to cultivate oneself. The United States should reflect on itself. Helping the recovery of Europe is necessary, and helping Asia also has the same need. Why does the United States only want to help Europe? It is inevitable that the Soviet Union will suspect the intentions of the United States. Now that the foreign ministers' meeting of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union has broken up unhappily, Secretary of State Marshall's European aid plan will have to be reconsidered.

In short, today's world needs the help of the United States, not only urgently, but also in a large amount; on the contrary, post-war America, for the sake of world peace, and for the sake of its own future, also needs to help the recovery of various countries in the world, because the prosperity of the United States does not completely rely on its domestic consumption, but is built on the world market. Therefore, it is hoped that the war-torn countries that are seeking US assistance will know how to regenerate themselves before they can get help; that is, those who help themselves will be helped by heaven. The United States, which is helping other countries, must also understand that helping others is helping oneself. In order to achieve its goals for its far-reaching ideals, assistance to other countries cannot be subject to any conditions. The United States needs to give special consideration to the current situation in China.

Finally, July 4th is also the National Day of the Republic of the Philippines, and we are willing to celebrate the National Day of the Philippines with the same feelings, and hope that China and the Philippines will work together to jointly maintain lasting peace in the Pacific!

### Britain and France Decide to Convene a European Conference to Discuss Secretary Marshall's Aid Plan for Europe; the Soviet Union is Also Invited to Participate; the Date is Set for July 12th and the Location is Still Paris

[Our Report] Paris, 3rd Broadcast: Britain and France will convene a general assembly of 24 European countries. The date is set for July 12th and the location is Paris. They will discuss Secretary Marshall's plan to revive Europe. Invitations have been issued to European countries, with the exception of Spain.

[Our Report] Paris, 3rd Broadcast: The 24-nation European conference is scheduled to convene on the 12th. The purpose is to quickly formulate a plan to be submitted to the United States before September 1st.

Further News: The French side today sent an invitation to Soviet Minister Bogomolov, along with a letter hoping that the Soviet Union will change its attitude, not insist, and participate in the European recovery effort.

[Our Report] London, 3rd Broadcast: Britain and France issued a joint communique stating: The British and French governments decided to invite European countries (excluding Spain) to participate in drafting the European recovery plan, reviewing the resources and needs of each country, so that each country can have the right to decide freely. The communique did not mention a word about the failure of the Soviet Union and the British-French-Soviet tripartite meeting.

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] British Foreign Minister Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault met again today, probably to continue discussing US Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan for European recovery. At the same time, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has set off to return home. This has made the disagreement between Britain and France and the Soviet Union on the Marshall Plan even more dramatic.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] US officials today believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the European recovery effort was also expected, but senior diplomatic circles are particularly depressed by it. US officials hope that Britain and France will not close the opportunity for the Soviet Union to participate when proceeding alone.

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] It is expected here that Bevin will return to London on Thursday afternoon, and it is believed that Bidault will fly to London on Friday or Saturday. A British-French joint invitation will be issued a few days later, inviting all European countries other than the Soviet Union to participate. According to the opinions of diplomats here, the real reason for the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate is that it is deeply afraid that the success of the Marshall Plan will weaken its control over most of Eastern European countries. It is reported that the question of which countries may participate has not yet been discussed. It is believed that the countries that may participate will include Luxembourg, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, the Western-occupied areas of Germany, Denmark, and Norway may also be included. Sweden is difficult to determine due to its geographical proximity to the Soviet Union. It is also believed that some countries, such as Czechoslovakia, are in a difficult position due to Molotov's decision, because it is a well-known fact that the Czechs are willing to participate in the Marshall Plan. The Soviet Union's aid to these poor countries cannot match that of the United States, but it is questionable whether Eastern European countries dare to offend the Soviet Union and accept the British and French invitations. According to observers, one of the most significant results of this meeting is that France has for the first time since 1944 clearly stated that it shares its fate with the West, and even expressed hostility to the goals of the Soviet Union. This sudden shift to the right is likely to cause serious internal friction in France, where the Communist Party is the only political party of the rightest force in the country.

### After the Failure of the British-French-Soviet Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Europe Will Be Divided into Two; British Officials Believe the Future is Particularly Pessimistic

[United Press, Paris, 2nd] After the Soviet Union refused to participate in Marshall's European economic recovery plan on the 2nd, Europe was divided into two from the Baltic Sea, along Stettin in northern Germany to Trieste in eastern Italy. As far as is expected, during the four-month-long dream period when the four-power foreign ministers' meeting opens in London in November, Western countries will engage in the work of the Marshall Plan, while the Soviet Union will find ways to strengthen its position behind the "Iron Curtain."

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The State Department tonight has fully prepared to proceed with the Marshall Plan to help European recovery, regardless of the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with Britain and France. Senior officials in London frankly admit that the British Cabinet is extremely pessimistic about the future of the Marshall Plan. Although Britain and France intend to proceed as planned regardless of the Soviet Union, any plan is very likely to miscarry without the support of the Soviet Union and its allies. Therefore, the United Kingdom has prepared to greatly reduce imports in case the Marshall Plan fails.

### Lie Expresses Regret over the Failure of the Paris Conference

[United Press, Lake Success, 2nd] UN Secretary-General Lie expressed regret when he heard the news about the breakdown of the Paris Tripartite Conference, and told a press conference that the United Nations will continue to work on this to implement Marshall's European recovery plan.

### Britain and the United States Will Allow Germany to Increase Steel Production; Secretary Marshall Refuses to Comment on the Failure of the Paris Conference

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The United States expected early on that the Soviet Union would refuse the British and French plan to aid Europe. Although Secretary of State Marshall refused to comment on it at a press conference today, he revealed information that the United States and Britain will instigate a recovery plan regardless of the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate. He briefly stated: The British and American occupation zones in Germany will soon announce revisions to their industrial production standards, and will allow steel production to increase to 10 million tons per year, which is double the tonnage agreed by the four powers. Although Secretary Marshall did not state that Britain and the United States had expected the Soviet Union to refuse to participate in this European aid plan, the imminent announcement of industrial production can prove that the two countries have indeed made preparations to promote the recovery of Germany. When asked about his views after the failure of the Paris Conference, Secretary Marshall refused to comment.

### Right-Wingers Pound Tables and Yell: Absurd Drama in the French Parliament; Black Forest Party Case Serious

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] During a meeting of the French National Assembly tonight, when Premier Ramadier mentioned the recently exposed "Blue Plan" rebellion plot, Lannelongue, leader of the right-wing Republican Liberty Party, accused the premier of defaming the right-wing members of the National Assembly, leading to a heated verbal battle. The assembly hall was thrown into chaos, with constant pounding of tables and yelling. The assembly broke up in discord.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] Since the exposure of the "Black Forest Party" treasonous conspiracy in France, an investigation is underway, but all information is being kept strictly secret. The case appears to be more serious than initially imagined. It is reported that the Minister of the Interior, when reporting on this case to the cabinet this morning, stated, "This is not merely the discovery of a secret arms depot." As for the names of the suspects, the Minister of the Interior refused to announce them before obtaining sufficient evidence. However, the activities of one key suspect, Chasseur, son of the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been revealed. In addition, the dismissal of General Larminat, Commander-in-Chief of the French Colonial Army, is one of the most shocking decisions made by the cabinet today.

### New Indonesian Cabinet Formed; New Prime Minister is Sjahrifoeddin; Progressive Muslim Salim Appointed Foreign Minister

[United Press, Yogyakarta, 3rd] After a week of consultations, the Indonesian Socialist Party, Labor Party, and Nationalist Party finally agreed today to form a coalition cabinet led by Sjahrifoeddin, a member of the Socialist Party and former Minister of Defense. President Sukarno then announced the appointment of Sjahrifoeddin as the new Prime Minister, succeeding Sjahrir. Sjahrifoeddin, 40, has served as a cabinet member since the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia. Although he belongs to the same party as former Prime Minister Sjahrir, he is not part of the moderate faction. Generally, Sjahrifoeddin is considered the politician most capable of controlling the Indonesian army. The recent cabinet crisis that forced Sjahrir to resign occurred because Sjahrifoeddin personally refused to support him. When the Japanese invaded Java, Sjahrifoeddin was sentenced to death, but Sukarno managed to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment. He regained his freedom after Japan surrendered. Later, he was imprisoned by the Dutch authorities for a year for engaging in national movements.

[United Press, Yogyakarta, 3rd] It is reported that Gani, a member of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, and Sitiadjie, a member of the Labor Party, have been appointed as Deputy Prime Ministers to assist the new Prime Minister Sjahrifoeddin in forming the cabinet. Sjahrifoeddin and Gani will also retain their positions as Minister of Defense and Minister of Economy, respectively. The progressive Muslim Salim will serve as Foreign Minister. Salim is currently working to gain recognition of the Republic of Indonesia from the Arab League.

### British Dominions Office Renamed; Titles of the British Monarch Will Also Change

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Dominions Office will be renamed the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and the Commonwealth Relations Office, because some people both within and outside Britain believe that the term "Dominion" can cause misunderstanding about the relationship between the United Kingdom and other countries within the Commonwealth. The agency's political reporter, Weyden, also stated that after the term "Dominion" is abolished, the titles of King George VI in relation to the Dominions will also change. The King's original title, "George VI, King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas," will now be "George VI, King of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand."

### Tensions Gradually Increase in Japanese Parliament; Katayama Tetsu Calls for Cooperation; Yoshida Raises the Issue of a Two-Party System

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] On the third day of the Japanese Diet session, Yoshida, President of the Liberal Party, began by questioning the government. The main points were: (1) Democratic countries must adopt a free economy and need appropriate economic policies. What decisions has the government made in this regard? (2) Regarding the restoration of foreign trade, is the government adequately prepared? (3) The most serious problems currently are unemployment countermeasures and the import of industrial raw materials. Is the government fully prepared for this? (4) It is generally considered fair for the politics of democratic Japan to be managed by two healthy major parties, but what is the government's course of action? I would like to know the details. Prime Minister Katayama responded: (1) While it is not impossible to have politics managed by two major parties, at present, national unity and cooperation are needed to overcome the various crises. (2) In view of the importance of trade, we are determined to devote all our efforts to ensure its smooth progress. (3) The import of raw materials is indeed necessary, but decisions can only be made after the peace treaty conference.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] In the House of Councillors, regarding land reform and immigration issues, Katayama replied: Land reform aims to abolish landlords and implement land reform, and efforts will be made to solve basic problems.

Immigration Policy

Regarding the immigration issue, measures most suitable for our nation will be adopted. Subsequently, Ichimatsu Sadakichi raised questions about democracy, the official price system, and food requisition. Katayama replied: Democracy differs from totalitarianism; it is a movement of the entire people demanding freedom. Currently, only a portion of the people enjoy freedom, while the majority of the people have no freedom to speak of. In order for the entire nation to enjoy freedom, those who currently enjoy freedom exclusively should endure and sacrifice their excessive freedom. A national pact has been made, and efforts are being made to achieve its realization.

Price Control System

Regarding the issue of officially set prices, Wada, Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, replied: The system of officially set prices cannot be stopped under the current economic conditions. Regarding the food issue, Minister of Agriculture Hirano replied: Improvements to the rice requisition system are planned for the rice harvested this autumn.

Reparations Issue

[Associated Press, Tokyo] Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry, Mizutani Chozaburo, replied to the Diet on the 3rd, stating that Japan has requested the Allied authorities to consider the industrial equipment in the reparations because the removal of industrial equipment will "seriously affect" Japan's recovery. Mizutani also requested that the Japanese government should faithfully implement the Allied's reparations decisions. He expressed his hope that the Allies would impose the "minimum" reparations on Japan, guaranteeing Japan's "minimum" living standards in peacetime.

### U.S. Economic Aid Plan for Korea Being Drafted

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Marshall recently stated: The U.S. economic aid plan for Korea is similar in nature to the aid for Greece and Turkey. It is currently being drafted and will be submitted to Congress for discussion.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] Rhee, the representative of the U.S. military government in Korea, announced to the press yesterday that the military government has proposed that the U.S. provide Korea with a $540 million loan for its reconstruction within three years. Furthermore, the negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Seoul have given rise to reasonable hopes that an agreement to establish a unified Korean government can be reached.

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Rhee declared that there are some separatist elements in South Korea who refuse to participate in the negotiations, which is detrimental to the Korean people. Syngman Rhee is one of them.

### Amendment to Local Tax Law Causes Difficulties for the Bureau of Finance; The Vast Majority of Households in This City May Be Exempt from Property Tax

[Our Dispatch] According to sources, the Central Government's amendment to the various local tax laws includes a provision in Article 6, Section 2 of the property tax regulations, which stipulates that "houses for personal use by residents, not exceeding one room per person," are also exempt from property tax. After receiving this new regulation, the local financial authorities believed that Shanghai was experiencing a serious housing shortage and that land was extremely valuable. Many residents lived in houses for personal use with no more than one room per person. Granting exemptions would significantly impact tax revenue. After research, it was believed that there was a typographical error and it should have read "not exceeding one room per household." An electrical request for interpretation was sent to the Ministry of Finance in March. The Ministry of Finance also believed that this provision was not practical and had already amended the proposal, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved by the Legislative Yuan with the reply: "No amendment is needed." This means that exemptions should still be based on the original amended regulations, i.e., any citizen using a house not exceeding one room per person can be exempt from property tax. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that this matter is of great importance, related to local tax revenue and the burden on all citizens. It is still under detailed study and amendment. Before the amendment, the original exemption standards will still be followed, i.e., any citizen using a house not exceeding one room per person can be exempt from property tax. The above instruction has already been received by the Municipal Bureau of Finance. However, according to reliable sources, the Bureau of Finance believes that this case is related to local tax revenue and is extremely difficult to handle. Since the housing shortage in this city is so serious, most people use no more than one room per person. In other words, most households in this city can be exempt from property tax. Therefore, the municipal financial authorities will argue with reason and strive to get the Legislative Yuan to amend the proposal as it is.

### First Batch of Japanese Reparation Warships Arrives in Shanghai; Three Destroyers and Five Escort Ships, Totaling Approximately 10,000 Tons; Docking at Gaochangmiao, Ceremony to Be Held on the 6th

[Our Dispatch] The first batch of eight Japanese warships and one escort ship as reparations to our country, piloted by 250 Japanese sailors led by Okada, with Navy Staff Officer Zhong Hanbo, a major in our delegation to Japan, and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Cossa as escorts, set sail from Sasebo at noon on the 1st and arrived at Gaochangmiao anchorage at 6:00 PM yesterday. A grand reception ceremony and flag-raising ceremony will be held at the Jiangnan Shipyard on the morning of the 6th.

At around 5:30 AM yesterday, the naval watchtower outside the Yangtze River estuary spotted the silhouettes of these nine warships. The naval authorities here sent General Staff Zhuang Huaiyuan, Commander Lin Binglai of the Dinghai warship, and Commander Chen Shu of the Puan warship, leading more than a hundred naval soldiers on two reception ships and Jiangfang boats, to wait outside the estuary in advance. At 2:00 PM, the nine warships arrived at Wusongkou, and our naval officers and soldiers boarded the ships to take over and led them into the Huangpu River in order. The escort ship "Wakataka" led the way, followed by the reparation ships "Yukikaze", "No. 14", "No. 194", "Kaede", "Hatsukume", "No. 67", "Yotsuzaka", and "No. 25". From 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM, the ships passed through the Bund area one after another, and the citizens on the riverside gathered to watch, all with smiles of victory. At around 6:00 PM, they arrived at the waters near the Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochangmiao and anchored.

The Eight Ships Are Still Relatively New

Among these eight reparation warships, three are destroyers and five are escort ships. They are all painted dark gray and appear quite old. The styles are different, and the sizes vary. The heaviest ship weighs 2,490 tons, and the lightest weighs 900 tons, with a total tonnage of 10,460 tons. The ships all fly the Japanese merchant flag and the international E flag, a red and blue reparations flag with green edges. The ship type, tonnage, and year of manufacture of each ship are as follows: "Yukikaze", destroyer, 2,490 tons, completed in 1938; "Hatsukume", destroyer, 1,580 tons, completed in 1945; "Kaede", destroyer, 1,530 tons, completed in 1945; "Yotsuzaka", escort ship, 1,020 tons, completed in 1944; "No. 67", escort ship, 1,020 tons, completed in 1944; "No. 215", escort ship, 1,020 tons, completed in 1945; "No. 14", escort ship, 900 tons, completed in 1945; "No. 194", escort ship, 900 tons, completed in 1945.

Encountered Heavy Fog En Route

After the ships docked, the reporter visited Major Zhong Hanbo. According to him, they encountered heavy fog en route, and the operation of the "No. 215" warship was also temporarily disrupted. In this four-nation lottery, the UK received 9,340 tons, the U.S. received 9,220 tons, and the Soviet Union received 9,530 tons, all less than our country. Although the number of warships remaining in the Japanese Navy after the war is still considerable, most of them are dilapidated. Among them, those that can be utilized, up to now, include 25 destroyers and 67 escort destroyers, totaling 92 ships. After the consent of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, they were evenly divided, and each country received 23 ships. The second batch of eight ships as reparations to our country is expected to sail to China by the end of this month. The dispatch of these eight ships to Shanghai was ordered by the Allied Headquarters in Japan, and Japanese sailors were ordered to deliver them, with a separate escort ship accompanying them. This escort ship will only stay in Shanghai for 72 hours and then transport all the Japanese sailors back to Japan. Zhong will then return to Tokyo to report to the Chinese delegation to Japan.

### Profit Tax for the 36th Year; Account Audits to Be Suspended Immediately

[Our Dispatch] The simplification of tax collection procedures for the 36th-year profit tax, which has been strongly advocated by the business community and representative bodies of this city, has been agreed upon by the Ministry of Finance to implement simplified standards on a trial basis. Over the past half month, the nine-member group of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has continuously consulted with the Direct Tax Bureau, Director Wang Fuzhou, and Director Lou Guo on various technical issues related to the standardization of the blessings, originally scheduled to be implemented today, but some issues remain to be discussed, and the date has to be extended. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce again sent a letter to the Direct Tax Bureau the day before yesterday, requesting a speedy resolution of the percentage of sample account books for simplified standards, how to leniently determine depreciation, inventory, and expenses, and budget allocation issues. It is reported that the Direct Tax Bureau has inquired about the request of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and has stopped the overall audit of accounts immediately.

### Falsely Accused of Theft; University Student Files a Lawsuit

[Our Dispatch] Feng Zhuzhu, Deputy Manager of Donglai Bank, entrusted He Deqi, the former Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, to sell a Western-style house at No. 45 Shengpingwei, Maoming Road, in early May of last year. The asking price at the time was 470 million yuan. Tao Ying, a university student, learned of this and introduced Zhang Xuemin and others to see the house on May 9th of this year. Feng's son led the tour. The next day, Tao, accompanied by lawyers Feng and Chen Rizheng, went to negotiate, but Feng changed the price to US$65,000, which at the time was equivalent to more than 600 million yuan, exceeding the original price by more than 200 million yuan, leading to a quarrel. Feng went out to call the police, claiming that there were robbers, and the police station dispatched a large number of police officers to arrest Tao and others. After clarifying the situation, they were released. However, Tao was unwilling to accept this and filed a lawsuit yesterday at the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing Feng Zhuzhu's son of disrupting order and falsely accusing them of theft. The District Prosecutor's Office will summon both parties for questioning in the coming days.

### Sending Six Teams to Various Buildings; Investigating and Dismantling Intercom Telephones; 19 Homes Confiscated; 18 Homes Suspected of Illegal Installation

[Our Dispatch] Starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, together with technical personnel from the Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company, divided into six teams of eight people each, went to the Securities, Gauze, and Overseas Chinese Buildings to cut and dismantle illegally installed intercom telephones. As of 1:00 PM, the companies found and confiscated included four companies in the Gauze Building: Jitai Yarn Thread Company, Changyu Company, Yuanxingchang Company, and Changji Company. Other companies, including Jinlong, Chengmao, Zhenxiang, and Jinkang, are suspected of illegal installation. In the Overseas Chinese Building, there are five companies: Dakang, Hengyongyuan, Xinji, Liji Gold Company, and Yimao. In the Securities Building, there are ten companies: No. 302, No. 323, Zhongxin, No. 362, No. 363, Daxing, Zhengda, Dafa, Shunfeng, and Fuda. Fourteen other companies are suspected of illegal installation. According to Xu Youzuo, the head of the Economic Section, the number of intercom telephones found and confiscated today (i.e., yesterday) was not large because the report had been published too early in the newspapers, and merchants had been alert and had mostly dismantled them themselves. However, the Bureau will continue to monitor closely. As for the results of the inspection of the trading houses, they will be presented by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank at the next economic meeting before they can be announced.

### Determined to Curb Rising Prices; Encouraging People to Report Information

To ensure quick rewards for informants, they plan to borrow from the Central Bank first, and if the information is accurate, the rewards can be issued first. Wu also revealed that there have already been many secret reports, and he hopes that citizens will actively report information. Finally, Wu declared that in the future, in addition to the Economic General Meeting, group meetings will be adopted.

### Heat Sets Record This Year; Today May Be Even Hotter

[Our Newspaper's Report] The weather in the city has been unusually hot and muggy for several days. Yesterday, the highest temperature reached 95 degrees Fahrenheit, setting a new heat record for this year. The time was around 2:00 PM. The lowest temperature also reached 76.9 degrees, which was around 6:00 AM. The reason for the mugginess is that a strong low-pressure system in the Pacific basin is moving towards mainland China. At the same time, the southeast and southwest winds in southern China are strong, carrying the humid heat of mainland China to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Currently, the area from the Yangtze River to the coastal areas of North China is shrouded in a low-pressure system, so the heat flow will be difficult to dissipate within one or two days, and today may be even hotter than yesterday. According to the highest temperature record for July in the past 70 years, it was 104 degrees in 1934 of the Republic. The weather forecast released by the Meteorological Observatory is recorded below: Yellow Sea: Cloudy, hot, thunderstorms, morning fog, fresh south to west winds, moderate waves. Central China: Cloudy, clear, hot, morning fog, local evening showers, moderate south to west winds. Shanghai: Cloudy, clear, hot, haze in the morning and evening, Yangtze River downstream, evening thunderstorms, moderate south to west winds.

### Reader Consultation; Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Stubborn, Difficult-to-Cure Malaria

Huang Zhenxin asks: My father is over sixty years old and has always been in good health. Recently, his physical strength has suddenly declined. He has been suffering from malaria for nearly a year, and it occurs whenever he works excessively. He did not pay attention to it at first, and it would heal on its own after a day or two. Since the beginning of summer, the condition has become more severe, occurring every day or every other day, greatly damaging his health. May I ask how this disease should be treated to be cured?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin] (1) You must first examine the blood to see if there are malaria parasites present. If it is malaria, use "Quinine pills" or "Atebrin." They must be taken according to the doctor's instructions to be effective. Sometimes, injecting arsenic preparations is also effective. In short, it is best to consult a doctor.

(2) High Blood Pressure

Chen Shaoqin asks: I suffered from high blood pressure two years ago, and examinations showed that there were no diseases in the heart and urine. After medical treatment, it is still sometimes high and sometimes low. Now a friend tells me that taking alum can cure high blood pressure, but I do not know (1) whether this statement is reliable? (2) whether regular consumption is harmful to the human body? Please provide detailed instructions for my benefit.

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin] (1) Alum has not been mentioned in pharmacology in relation to high blood pressure. It is commonly used as an internal medicine for diarrhea, a gargle for pharyngitis, and a cleansing agent for vaginal discharge. (2) The internal dosage of alum is 0.3-2 grams. If taken in large quantities, it can cause burning pain in the mouth and throat. It can also cause vomiting and diarrhea.

(2) In the next semester, the Colleges of Law, Agriculture, Engineering, Liberal Arts and Sciences, and Medicine should set up more examination areas and expand enrollment. (3) Adjust personnel fairly and practically, eliminate the weak and retain the strong, as the foundation for the new Yingshi University. (4) The students have been petitioning and running around for several months, all for the sake of the school's future. Their motives are pure and their goals are accurate. Please guarantee the safety of the students. It is reported that the new president has replied to the above four points with "permission to consider," and the students are quite satisfied with this move by the new president. The turbulent situation of Yingshi University for several months may stabilize from now on.

It only took him an hour to defeat Pears, and Pears had no resistance in the last two sets. His superb skills are amazing, and the championship this year will definitely belong to Kramer.

### Increased Pressure, Speculation Retreats Shanghai Stocks Fall Across the Board Yongsha Meiya Falls Below the Daily Limit

Yesterday, unfavorable conditions plagued Shanghai stocks. The implementation of a 50% cash margin requirement, power restrictions, and the removal of intercom phones left no room for recovery. The bulls could only liquidate their positions with pain. The downward trend intensified. Although there was some recovery due to financial institutions bargain-hunting and short-sellers covering their positions, the hopeless environment and the authorities' removal of intercom phones discouraged activity. Both trading volume inside and outside the exchange decreased significantly. Aside from falling to the limit, Yongsha Meiya traded far below the limit. There is little hope for a recovery in the short term. The opening sentiment was already weak, and most stocks opened lower. Yongsha opened at a low price of 8700 yuan. Due to Yongsha's capital increase, the situation was favorable, and some short-sellers covered their positions. After the opening, transactions for Yongsha were bought by numbers 172, 173, 91, 76, and 177, while transactions for Yongsha were absorbed by numbers 24, 108, 73, and 224, gradually recovering to a current delivery price of 8450 yuan and a deferred delivery price of 8950 yuan.

At this time, the spread between current and deferred prices rose from 370 yuan to 450 yuan, so current delivery Yongsha could not exceed the opening price. Numbers 32, 163, and 85 sold current Yongsha at high prices, and numbers 163, 142, and 199 also sold deferred Yongsha, and the market weakened again. Tongyi by number 180, current Meiya by number 89, Xinho by numbers 17, 73, and 133, current Yongsha by number 35, deferred Meiya by number 105, and current Xinguang by number 142 were gradually pushed to the daily limit. Deferred Yongsha gradually fell to the daily limit of 8390 yuan. Numbers 54 and 24 bought at low prices, and deferred Yongsha rose to 8550 yuan. At this time, numbers 76, 36, and 160 were still selling, and the price fell again to around 8400 yuan. Later, number 177 and number 8 absorbed current Yongsha on behalf of the banking sector, and numbers 95 and 31 also bought, while numbers 218, 94, 228, and 8 also bought deferred Yongsha. Although number 212 and 131 sold a considerable amount of current Yongsha, after 10 AM, current Yongsha recovered to 8350 yuan and deferred Yongsha to 8750 yuan. Numbers 97, 231, 70, and 17 sold current Yongsha, and number 14 also sold deferred Yongsha, and number 85 also closed their positions. Zhongs's lowered to the daily limit by number 160, and deferred Yongsha fell back to within 8600 yuan. After 10:30 AM until 11:15 AM, the market was sluggish, and transactions were sparse. Current delivery Yongsha hovered around 8250 yuan, and deferred delivery yarn hovered around 8600 yuan. The outside interest rate still opened within three corners or so, and the removal of telephones was intensified. The Stock Exchange also issued a notice ordering all brokers not to engage in outside transactions, and people remained nervous. The popular stocks deteriorated further, and their enthusiasm waned. At 11:30 AM, the selling wind started again, and numbers 94, 23, 35, and 157 sold. Current Yongsha by number 154 and 203, and deferred Yongsha by numbers 32 and 223, all hung at the daily limit. Deferred Xinguang by number 131, and Yonggong by number 191, all hung low to the daily limit. After that, the market collapsed. Yongsha by numbers 223, 65, and 148 selling current Yongsha, fell to 7750 yuan, and deferred Yongsha fell to 8050 yuan. Current Meiya at 430 yuan and deferred Meiya at 450 yuan were transacted. Datong, Business, Match, Zhongfang also fell to the limit. As a result, compared with before the close, current stocks such as Yongsha, Xinho, Meiya, Xinguang, Yonggong, and Jingfu all fell to the limit. Hua, Dong, Xing, Zhongfa, and Xinhua each fell by about half. Business, Match, Tongyi, Datong, Zhongs's all fell to the limit. Xinya fell more than half. Zhongfang recovered after falling to the limit. Innerwear, Cement, Lian, and Jinglun each fell by 10%. Deferred stocks such as Yonggong fell by half, Yongsha, Xinho, Meiya, Xinguang, and Jingfu all fell to the limit, and Huafeng fell less than half. In the outside market, old stocks such as Zhabei, Huashang, Zhonghua, and Nanyang decreased slightly, and Dasheng, Wuzhou, and Shijie were flat.

### Limited Transactions for United Bonds and Foreign Stocks

Yesterday, no one cared about public bonds, and few operators were active, so there were only hundreds of thousands of transactions. Tong Bing opened at 8500 yuan, and 360 rooms sold more than 400,000, immediately falling to 7300 yuan, and then slightly stabilizing. As a result, compared to the pre-close, A, B, and C each fell 400 yuan, Tong Ding fell 600 yuan, and Tong E fell 700 yuan. Amidst the investigation of the black market, the future is difficult to boost.

Yesterday, normal transactions of foreign stocks were temporarily suspended due to the authorities' removal of intercom phones, which made activity inconvenient and transactions extremely limited. Yisha opened at 85,000 yuan and fell to 82,000 yuan before closing. As a result, compared to the pre-close, shipping fell 10%, paper fell slightly, and the remaining stocks each fell about 5%.

### Arbitrage Transactions Greatly Diminished

The current delivery spread yesterday for Yongsha rose from 370 yuan to 450 yuan, then fell to 270 yuan, closing at 300 yuan. Numbers 185, 156, and 231 posted, while number 177 and the banking sector, including numbers 178, 56, 207, 45, 220, 11, 142, 31, and 112, added to their positions. Deferred delivery lacked activity due to the heavy burden on the Securities Finance Corporation, and transactions were not numerous. After 11:30 AM, the price fell to a low, and the interest rate ranged from 1.2 to 1.9 corners. Xinho ranged from 953 to 190 yuan. Xinguang ranged from 7 yuan to 8.5 yuan, and Huafeng retreated from 5.5 yuan to 4.7 yuan.

### Securities Exchange Prohibits Dummy Transactions

The Shanghai Securities Exchange announced to all brokers that the government has strictly prohibited the operation of gold and U.S. dollar transactions, and that black market dummy transactions in securities also violate the law. Most brokers are well aware of the overall situation and know what to avoid. At a time when the government is strictly cracking down, a special warning is given, and it is hoped that they will further self-examine themselves to avoid punishment.

### Uneven Arrivals from Various Places Rice Continues to be Weak Flour Sales Increase then Decrease again

Yesterday, more than 10,000 dan of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets. Most of the arrivals were long-grain rice from the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, with shipments from Shashi, Hankou, Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang, as well as from northern Jiangsu. In the southern market, japonica rice fell by 35,000 to 10,000 yuan, and indica rice also fell by 10,000 to more than 10,000 yuan. White Yuan was still scarce and lacking in transactions, while customer Yuan was the most sluggish. The trend in the northern market was weak.

Flour sales turned sluggish, plummeting by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Bran also fell by a small amount, 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were active during the peak season, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were in short supply, continuing to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Tea beans were scarce in both supply and demand, and the market was stable.

Red beans turned flat, and the price was fixed. Raw peanuts saw weak sales and became stagnant. Sesame was scarce and continued to be firm, still heading towards its peak. Sorghum rose secretly, corn from the north was unchanged, falling back 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, and medium-grade corn fell wildly by 10,000 yuan.

The oil market saw weak demand from shops, and transactions were cold. Raw soybean oil fell back by 10,000 yuan, sesame oil was flat, and green oil and rapeseed oil also fell by 10,000 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil sales were very sluggish.

Loan Measures for Flour Mills Undetermined

According to information from the flour mill industry, applications for loans for the purchase of wheat have not received a definite answer to date. The mills are eagerly awaiting the Ministry of Food to decide on loan measures in order to obtain sufficient raw materials and maintain production. The Ministry of Food has had several loan measures, but none have been decided upon yet. As a result, the loan has been repeatedly delayed. Currently, the mills are only relying on free funds to purchase a small amount of wheat, so production is intermittent. Yesterday, representatives of the city's five major flour mills contacted the National Bank to negotiate loans, but to no avail because the authorities' loans had not been decided. The industry is currently urging the authorities.

Batch of Soybeans to Arrive in Shanghai

The Central Trust Bureau ordered 10,000 tons of soybeans from the Northeast. To date, only 2,400 tons have been shipped. The remainder has been affected by the war in the Northeast, and imports and exports are restricted, so these soybeans cannot be exported. It is reported that the Bureau's Northeast branch is working to ship 3,600 tons from the Northeast, which will arrive in Shanghai this month. The remaining 4,000 tons are still being shipped. After shipment to Shanghai, all of the soybeans will be delivered to the oil extraction industry to produce edible oil and regulate market supply and demand.

Tendering for Flour and Siamese White Rice

The Central Trust Bureau is holding a public tender for over 900,000 pounds of water-damaged flour and over 50,000 market jin of inferior Siamese white rice. The procedures are as follows: (1) Those who wish to bid can go to Room 322 on the third floor of 74 Renji Road to inquire about the price and obtain "Tender Notice." (2) Viewing period: 9 AM to 12 PM and 2 PM to 5 PM on the 8th. (3) Bidding deadline: Before 11 AM on the 10th. (4) Bidding opening date: 11 AM on the 10th.

### New Plan Decided for Purchasing Export Goods

The 15th meeting of the Export Promotion Committee was held in the Central Bank meeting room on the 1st. The issues discussed that day did not reach a conclusion. The meeting continued on the 2nd and ended in the afternoon. It is reported that the issues discussed at this meeting were: 1. The purchase of export goods; 2. The purchase and sale of raw silk. Regarding the former, a new plan has been decided and submitted to the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and National Economic Commission for approval. Regarding the latter, a separate group has been formed to review it. It is reported that the purchase method in the future will entrust export merchants to handle it, in order to achieve cooperation between officials and merchants and jointly solve difficulties. Chen Guangfu, the vice-chairman of the committee, took the purchase plan to Beijing on the evening of the 2nd to discuss it with the relevant departments in the central government, so that the current deadlock could be broken quickly.

### Representatives of the Silverware Industry Complain to the Social Affairs Bureau

[Report from this Newspaper] The silverware industry, seeing that the resumption of business has been delayed until now and that the central government has not issued a clear order, finds it difficult to maintain business if it continues like this, and the livelihood of workers will also be cut off. Yesterday afternoon, representatives were sent: Jie Gen, Yao Guiqing, Chen Dezhang, and Wu Pengnian, four representatives met with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated their appeals, and asked them to forward them to the central government to find out if there is any way to continue to maintain the industry. Otherwise, they will simply lay off workers to avoid dragging them down. Director Wu promised to raise this issue at this week's municipal meeting.

According to Director Wu's words to reporters, he will ask Mayor Wu to telegraph the central government before the central government has approved it, asking them to find a way to remedy the situation. This is because the city's silverware industry employs more than 30,000 workers, and if calculated on the basis of a family of three, if they are laid off, 100,000 people will have no means of living, which will become a serious social problem.

According to people in the silverware industry, the business of silverware and silver utensils usually accounts for only one-fiftieth of the total business. If only silver business is operated, it is impossible to maintain. Moreover, few people exchange silver bracelets and rings and wear gold jewelry, and it is difficult to guarantee that silver will not have a black market.

### Cotton Market Price Downstream

Yesterday's spot cotton market, due to the weak opening price of cotton yarn and the slack demand from yarn mills, market sentiment was soft. Although the city's inventory is low, reports from various parties in recent days indicate that the authorities are determined to suppress prices, so the incoming side is becoming cautious. In the afternoon, the closing price of cotton yarn slightly improved, yarn mills took some demand, and customer groups also added some, the market was weak but firm, and transactions were slightly stronger. The offer price of each stall was 1.98 million for Lingbao cotton sent to the factory, and 1.6 million for Hankou coarse velvet. The stock price was 1.57 million for Chongtongzhou, 1.85 million for Shashi, 1.9 million for Lingbao. 1.93 million, 1.94 million to 1.95 million, 1.64 million for Hankou fine cotton, 1.62 million for Tongzhou, 1.65 million for Hankou, and 260,000 to 280,000 per group for Zhoupu seed cotton.

### Measures Determined for Handling Pledged Tea from 1946 Loans Expire and Should be Redeemed, No Extensions Allowed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The United Four Banks held its 347th board meeting this morning, presided over by Vice Chairman Zhang Qun. Attendees included Directors Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Xu Kan, Chen Guofu, Chen Qitian, Zhao Dihua, Li Shumin, and Secretary-General Xu Boyuan, Director Wu Rencang, Director Gu Chunfan, and General Manager Shou Miancheng. In addition to approving 81 loan cases, they later passed the 1946 tea loan case, the measures for handling pledged box tea, and the measures for promoting the 1947 tea loan, excerpted as follows:

(1) Measures for handling pledged box tea from 1946: The total amount of tea loans in 1946 was originally approved by Deputy Chairman Song as 7 billion yuan. After the tea merchants made box tea, the market price abroad was lower than the domestic cost. They also requested that the box tea be used as collateral at 70% off to transfer it into a box tea pledge loan in order to end the tea loan. During November, the Farmers Bank and the Central Bank agreed and repeatedly increased the pledge loan, totaling 20 billion yuan. This box tea has been shipped to Shanghai for nearly a year, and it should be urgently planned for sale to avoid stagnation. The following four points have now been decided on: (1) From July 10th, the box tea pledge loan will expire and no extensions will be allowed. If the tea merchants do not have the funds to redeem the tea, the collateral will be disposed of. (2) From now until July 20th, tea merchants may apply to the China Trust Bureau to purchase the box tea. (3) Before the purchased box tea is exported, the China Trust Bureau should consult with the competent authorities to re-inspect all of it. Tea that does not meet the standards may not be exported. (4) Other export box tea from various places that has been shipped to Shanghai in 1946 may also apply in accordance with this method and be purchased by the China Trust Bureau.

Measures for Promoting this Year's Tea Loan

The total amount of the 1947 tea loan is 28 billion yuan, which has been successively loaned by the Farmers Bank. The remaining 53.9 billion yuan for transportation and sales loans for export locations should be approved and released by the Farmers Bank. The government has a purchase plan for major export goods, and tea is also one of the purchase targets. In order to cooperate with the government's policies, the following three points have been approved: (1) The scope of purchase includes all tea that meets export standards and cannot be transported and sold by tea merchants. (2) The purchase price is calculated based on the cost of production and transportation plus legal profit. The main organizer presides over the bidding. (3) Purchase deadline: Tea merchants who borrow from the Farmers Bank may apply for purchase at the time of expiration if they have no way to prepare funds for redemption in order to repay the loan. They may not re-apply for purchase a second time.

### Cigarette Market Sentiment Turns Firm

Yesterday, the cigarette market turned firm. After the opening, there was a strong demand from the shopkeepers in the market, and the asking prices were firm. The bulls had been almost completely wiped out, selling, watching, and the market rose.

American cigarettes were flat, while loose cigarettes all decreased slightly.

### Yarn Market Weak then Firm

Yesterday's cotton yarn market, due to the authorities' strict price controls and inspections of yarn and cloth merchants, market sentiment was weak and transactions were very weak. After the opening of the market, some floating households settled their positions, and prices fell. Near the closing, local dyeing and weaving factories bought in, and some also absorbed purchases at low prices, so prices rose again. Twenty-count Shuangma yarn once fell to 9.4 million yuan, but finally closed at 10.1 million yuan, an increase of more than 20,000 yuan compared to Monday. Except for a slight decrease in 42-count and 40-count fine yarn, the prices of coarse yarn such as 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count all rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

(3) If foreign exchange settlement is required for the necessary expenses of cotton yarn exports, such as electricity fees and insurance fees, the Central Bank will approve the supply.

### Next Taiwan Sugar Allocation Price to Increase by One-Quarter

It is reported that since the recent adjustment of the Taiwan dollar exchange rate to a ratio of one to sixty-five, Taiwan Sugar's costs have increased by 25%. The allocation price of medium-grade granulated sugar this period is 400,000 yuan. It is said that in the 23rd allocation next week, the price of sugar in each grade must be increased by at least one-quarter, and the allocation price of medium-grade granulated sugar will be sold for 500,000 yuan per 100 "jin".

Another report: Yesterday, the 22nd quota of Taiwan Sugar remained the same, and the price also lacked change. However, the market for white sugar was tighter. Peruvian sugar was 6,780,000 yuan, and 20 medium-grade granulated white sugar was 6,000,000 to 6,100,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half-car white sugar was 6,340,000 yuan, Xingchi red sugar was 5,780,000 yuan, and at the same time, local sugar was slightly looser. Shantou green sugar was 420,000 yuan, a slight increase of 5,000 yuan. Mianchi red sugar was 470,000 yuan, a slight increase of 12,000 yuan. Xinghua white Gaozhuang was 5,580,000 yuan, followed by 5,500,000 to 5,450,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar was 4,450,000 yuan, all with a slight increase of 12,000 yuan, totaling more than 500 "gong". Diao green sugar was 380,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Relatively Active

The first half of the year's settlement period for silver money businesses has swiftly passed. Yesterday, the tea market situation for domestic sales, in addition to the local street shops and the Suzhou and Guangdong gangs, continued to inquire. New buyers from Fengjing and other areas also frequently approached, making the market more active and colorful than before the holiday, and the prices were also extremely stable. Only Wuchang Dadechang and other tea companies were still absorbing export tea, while the rest were inevitably hesitant. Therefore, the holders of goods tried to stabilize, and the price did not fall. According to people in the industry, the French Yongxing Foreign Company is now consulting with the sellers regarding green tea such as Chun Mee. If a solution can be found, a considerable transaction may occur.

### Soap Sales Mostly Decline

Yesterday, the daily necessities market opened very lively in the morning, with prices fluctuating slightly. However, by the afternoon market, a general floating of supply appeared on the market, and the market atmosphere suddenly weakened. In the end, Guben soap retreated by 15,000 yuan per box compared to yesterday, to 455,000 yuan. Arrow knife soap was 450,000 yuan, also down slightly by 10,000 yuan. Huangxiangmao, Guanghua, Henry, and Cow Brand soaps all fell by 12,000 yuan.

The match market, due to increased costs and a shortage of raw materials, prices frequently rose, and it was heard that the factory prices were also about to be adjusted, causing people to be optimistic and prices to rise sharply. As a result, Beauty Brand increased by 150,000 yuan per box compared to the previous day, to 3,100,000 yuan. Phoenix and Ningbo also rose by 100,000 yuan, while Nanjing, Tiger, and Caiju, etc., rose by 58,000 yuan.

### Revised Restriction Measures for Private Car Imports

[This newspaper news] The Import Management Committee revised two articles of the restriction measures for foreign travelers bringing private cars into the country, effective yesterday, as follows: (1) Travelers bringing private cars into the country must have proof that they have owned and used the car for more than six months before departing from abroad (excluding Hong Kong and Kowloon) to be eligible to apply for import. However, those departing within one month after the announcement are temporarily allowed to follow the old rules. (2) Travelers entering the country from Hong Kong and Macau are not allowed to bring private cars into the country. However, those departing within two weeks after the announcement are temporarily allowed to follow the old rules.

It is reported that the United States also originally stipulated that travelers must have proof that they have owned and used private cars for more than six months before exporting them to be eligible to apply for export. Now that the provision has been canceled, our country has added the restriction measure in terms of withdrawal management.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### Preface to "Collected Medical Essays of Fan Shi"

— Yu Yunxiu

Mr. Fan Shouyuan, in his eyes, could not tolerate the chaos and filth of our country's medical affairs. He raised his pen, which could sweep away thousands of troops, and loudly appealed in society for about twenty years. He is now dividing his past to recent writings into five collections, namely the first collection of speeches, the second collection of reviews, the third collection of casual talks, the fourth collection of common sense, and the fifth collection of miscellany, and compiling them into a book called "Collected Medical Essays of Fan Shi," which is about to be published. I have two feelings about the publication of this book.

The first is that our society is not progressing. Almost everyone knows and admits that Chinese culture is backward, and medicine is one of the cultures, so of course it cannot but be backward. Knowing the backwardness and admitting the backwardness, but not having the power to promote it, reform it, unify it, wash it, and even stir it up even more, this is what we cannot tolerate in our eyes and cannot but loudly appeal for. If we could thoroughly understand the reason for the backwardness and strive to improve, catch up, then in these twenty years, the situation would have changed greatly, and Mr. Fan's loudly appealed sound piece would have been a cliché, as if there was no need to broadcast it again. But now, standing up and looking at the environment, those who wildly talk about empty idealistic philosophy are still like that, those who blindly believe in vulgar experience are still like that, those who diagnose diseases by taking the pulse are still like that, those who prescribe prescriptions with traditional decoctions are still like that, and they strive for balance in medical administration and laws, and seek inferiority in academic qualifications. The former is used to defend against coercion, and the latter is used to breed followers, completely centering on their own partial interests, and ignoring the rise and fall of the country, the interests of the people, the international reputation, and the progress and retreat of academics. This style is extremely popular, so for twenty years, progress has stagnated, and it is still the original color of chaos and filth. Following that, Mr. Fan's loudly appealed record has also lasted for twenty years, as if it is still brand new and there is a need to broadcast it again. Under this feeling, I am embarrassed to congratulate Mr. Fan, but instead want to mourn for society.

The second is that people in our society do not understand too much. I often say that speaking requires someone on the other side. Zhong Ziqi was a confidant of Bo Ya's "qin" (zither). After Zhong Ziqi died, Bo Ya broke the "qin" and stopped playing it. This story is what we often use, so Zhuangzi has the saying "Loud sounds do not enter the ears." "Li er" means vulgar ears and eyes. Now the immaturity of the thinking of the Chinese people is really alarming. There are still people who stick to metaphysics from the sixth and seventh centuries, treating it as their precious possession, and being arrogant and boastful. In such a society, telling them scientific truth will not make them listen to us calmly. The root cause is that they do not understand our speech. How many people have resonated with Mr. Fan's loudly appealed for twenty years? Try to look at the stagnation and non-progress of medical affairs to test how much effect our words have had. The act of breaking the "qin" is a profound reflection of society. Several of my colleagues often think that criticism of old medicine is a useless act. They all feel that there is no one to listen. In such a society, Mr. Fan insists on speaking tirelessly and enthusiastically broadcasting his sound piece. Under this feeling, I have no time to be sad for Mr. Fan, but instead want to cry bitterly for society.

Despite the stubbornness of society, despite the immaturity of society, Mr. Fan also clearly understands that the Chinese people are difficult to awaken, and also clearly understands that hard work yields little success, but he perseveres and is tireless, what is the reason for this? I solemnly declare: this is a manifestation of patriotic enthusiasm, worthy of twelve points of admiration! Chen Men evaluated Confucius and said: "Is it difficult for those who know it cannot be done and do it anyway?" How much pain does this sentence contain!

### Talking about Allergic Reactions (Allergie)

— Shou Wuqing

Recently, Shanghai Newspapers reported that a doctor injected a local anesthetic and electrocuted a patient with "dian zheng" (epilepsy), and died due to an allergic reaction to Nuofuke Yin (Novocaine brand name). The prosecutor, after insight into medical principles, announced that he was not guilty, and the medical community applauded. Readers may not understand the meaning of allergic reactions in detail. If unfortunately encountering this situation, patients often misunderstand, causing medical disputes, or even resorting to the court, citing the provisions of causing death due to professional negligence, and attaching civil lawsuits for compensation, blaming the doctor, it is necessary to explain special reactions.

Allergy is a specialized medical term, caused by the patient's special constitution, Allergic Constitution. The so-called special constitution is an unusual feeling. Someone has abnormal dynamics under certain circumstances. In other words, without a special constitution, there is no special reaction (or allergic reaction). There are no statistics on special constitutions in medical books, but in fact, at least one or two out of every thousand people have it. This constitution is rich in congenital heredity. From father to son to grandson. From mother to daughter to nephew. However, the milder degrees of special reactions are often not noticed by patients. Such as urticaria (skin) caused by eating vegetables, fish, shrimp, etc. Abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea (gastrointestinal) caused by eating clams, snails, crabs, etc. Chronic seeping eczema caused by drinking human milk and cow's milk (infant milk rash). Other examples include asthma caused by eating chicken eggs, and hay fever caused by smelling pollen (nervous). The special proteins contained in each food stimulate the patient's nerve cells, causing an abnormal reaction.

Drug-induced special reactions are not uncommon. Those who take a small amount of aspirin and produce a large amount of dirty liquid, those who take a small amount of pyrimidine and their temperature drops sharply, those who take quinine and develop red rashes, those who take hormones and develop skin patches, those who take painkillers and feel more severe headaches, those who take a small amount of eye medicine and fall asleep for a long time, those who drink a lot of yellow wine and not only do not get drunk, but become ecstatic. All of these only describe the most minor special reactions. As for serum injections, common allergic reactions are very rapid. Try injecting a small amount of serum directly into the muscle. In an instant, the face swells, the head becomes as big as a bucket, the eyelids and lips swell and are about to burst, the larynx and glottis, all edema, difficulty breathing, suffocation, cyanosis. However, in life-threatening diphtheria, this type of constitution exists. If diphtheria serum is not injected cautiously, it is difficult to achieve a cure. Therefore, nowadays, patients with traumatic obstruction rarely use serum injection therapy except when absolutely necessary. Even the currently popular penicillin and new drugs for lung disease have the potential to cause special reactions in people with special constitutions (such as chills, high fever, vomiting, rashes, etc.). In the past, it was heard that milk muscle injections (shock therapy) caused extremely dangerous special reactions, and injections of amnyding, silver, and vitamin B caused death. All of these were caused by patients having special constitutions and developing special reactions.

In short, allergic reactions are caused by special constitutions. Special constitutions are the body's allergic reaction, and the underdevelopment of the nervous system and abnormal feelings are the underlying causes. This underlying cause cannot be described by quality or quantity, nor can it be tested by sitting cushions, electrometers, chemical methods, etc. Doctors can hardly predict it during hasty clinical visits. However, similar feelings are occasionally discovered unknowingly in daily life. If it has already happened, then treat it immediately. Mild symptoms are not a problem. For severe illnesses that cannot be salvaged, the doctor is not responsible. Unfortunate facts of the past may be seen again in the future, and it is not uncommon to have special reactions from a medical perspective.

### Hydrophobia

— Chen Yuan

Hydrophobia is another name for rabies. In recent years, various medical publications and magazines have discussed it a lot. Now I will discuss the name of the disease, and I think it will not be considered superfluous. That is, first, why is "rabies" also called "hydrophobia"? In fact, there are many precedents for one disease with two names! For example, malaria, isn't it also called intermittent fever? The name malaria belongs to the traditional original name, while intermittent fever refers to one of its characteristics, named entirely with symptoms. Because everyone agrees with it, the two names are used together to this day. By analogy, the meaning of hydrophobia and rabies is the same. Rabies can be called the traditional name, while hydrophobia can be called the symptomatic name. This is because the most noticeable and earliest symptom shown by rabies patients, especially unique to humans after contracting rabies but not present in diseased dogs or diseased cats, is this hydrophobia phenomenon. Speaking of symptomatic naming, it is convenient for people to understand the meaning of the words, and to understand the disease naturally when they see the name. Let's talk about malaria first; its fever has a temporal nature. There is fever on the day of onset, and no fever on the day of rest. Because there is a certain period of time between the first fever and the subsequent fever, it is also called tertian fever for those that recur every other day, and quartan fever for those that recur every two days. It is truly descriptive and makes people very alert. Now, using hydrophobia to describe people with rabies is the same. Because patients in the onset of the disease must cause spasms of the pharyngeal muscles when they see any liquid. Not only can they not swallow this liquid and send it to the esophagus, but the shape is extremely painful, as if the liquid is something the patient fears. However, how can the environment be far away from liquids? Especially water, which is indispensable for life; how is it possible to keep the patient from approaching water? Therefore, patients with rabies must have symptoms of hydrophobia, which is discovered by people. Just give it another name, call it hydrophobia, and everyone thinks it is natural. In fact, hydrophobia symptoms are just a phenomenon of difficulty swallowing for ordinary patients! The difference is that ordinary sore throats still can barely drink liquids at first. It is not until the illness is severe that they cannot swallow liquids. Hydrophobia, on the other hand, cannot drink water from the beginning. And at the beginning of the illness, all solid foods may still be swallowed; the more they see liquids, the more difficult it becomes. Especially when taking medicine, it is most embarrassing. Many patients are discovered to have hydrophobia because of difficulty drinking medicine!

Second, hydrophobia symptoms are a characteristic of rabies patients. In ancient China, no one proposed it and discussed it. Turning over ancient books, there are few specific records, which is really unbelievable. On the contrary, there are absurd and unreliable fallacies circulating in society. Especially in the mouths of village old women, there are many superstitions. For example, saying "after a person is bitten by a mad dog, a puppy is born in the abdomen" is still deeply rooted in people's hearts. In this way, in all levels of society, misrepresentation is spread, which really makes people unable to understand! From the point of view of common sense, it is a joke that humans can have dog fetuses. Even among dogs of the same race, why do the male and female mate without using the reproductive organs? There is no reason to become pregnant due to biting with teeth. This absurd fabrication, I don't know who it started from? But no one has ever come out to doubt it; but no one has ever confirmed it, which shows that there are all followers in society. Therefore, it can be thought that the observation power of the ancients was very weak. Rabies can indeed be said to be a terminal illness, and everyone should have observed it in detail and investigated it long ago. If the ancients could pay attention in a comprehensive way, then symptoms such as hydrophobia should have been discovered long ago, so why turn a blind eye? But now the most obvious and unique characteristics have been ignored, isn't it regrettable! As the author speculates, this is entirely the confusion of the ancients. Because hydrophobia symptoms are already expressed in the early stage of the patient, when the mind is clear, but the patient's psychology does not have the self-awareness of fear of water. Because the patient does not recognize that water is a long thing, so bystanders do not take it seriously. Later, as the illness worsened, not only would seeing water cause spasms of the pharyngeal muscles; at the same time, the chewing muscles would also spasm. Therefore, although the patient cannot eat or drink; on the outside, they can see unconscious actions such as empty swallowing and empty chewing. Further, it is also possible to discover abnormal states such as biting bystanders and biting objects. At this time, it is almost similar to the phenomenon of crazy dogs. Everyone is paying attention to the development of its neurological symptoms, and they do not have time to investigate the relationship between hydrophobia and non-hydrophobia!

Third, are hydrophobia symptoms necessarily present in rabies patients? This question, of course, need not be doubted. Anyone suffering from rabies will definitely show this symptom. Because when rabies virus occurs, the first to be affected is the various muscles of the throat. At this time, the nerves in this part are abnormally sensitive. Slight excitement will cause spasm; therefore, food is blocked and difficult to swallow. Especially for drinks, it is especially difficult to swallow. Later, the range of spasms gradually expands, and the chewing muscles; facial muscles; and even the whole body muscles, all spasm. And consciousness gradually disappears, and becomes crazy. However, the illness is still progressing, and finally it becomes paralysis. For a while, it seems that the madness is reduced, and the disease has improved. The spasms of each part stop; the swallowing action is not difficult, and they can slightly swallow some liquid, and their mind and spirit are also much settled. But good times don't last long, and soon the whole body enters a state of paralysis; therefore, the heart and breathing stop together, and in the end, they cannot be saved. It has not been heard that anyone can escape death. However, in fact, there are also a few patients who enter a state of paralysis as soon as they get sick. Any spasm phenomenon has not been expressed, and they have already lost their lives. This is of course an extremely serious case; and the lightning strike type of other infectious diseases; is somewhat similar?

### Physiological Hygiene of the Five Sensory Organs (Part 2)

— Bai Ding

(2) Eye Hygiene: The eyes are for seeing things. The importance of the eyes to the body as a whole is even greater than that of the ears. Without this pair of round eyes, we would not be able to see anything; we would be blind. Even with eyes, if their tissues or functions are impaired or damaged, our vision will be reduced or lost altogether. Now, let me write a few tips on how to protect your eyes hygienically.

1.  Eyes should be protected to prevent external dust and smoke from blowing into them. If they do get into the eyes, take immediate steps to remove them. When removing them, do not rub with your hands, so as not to damage the cornea of the eyeball. Instead, close your eyes temporarily and let the tears flow out. Foreign objects such as dust and smoke will then be washed out with the tears. If this doesn't work, turn the eyelid upwards and gently remove the foreign object with clean cotton or a brush.

2.  On hot summer days, avoid opening your eyes too wide in strong sunlight, or wear colored sunglasses to protect your eyes from strong light. Do not go suddenly from a dark place to a bright place.

3.  Each person should have their own towel and washcloth to prevent the spread of trachoma (please refer to my article "How to Prevent Trachoma").

4.  Get enough sleep and avoid insomnia. Both short sleep duration and sleepless insomnia can impair the eyes. These are a few hygienic methods for protecting the eyes.

(3) Nose Hygiene: Because the nose controls smell, it can also be called the hygiene of the sense of smell. It is also quite important, and yet often overlooked by most people. Now, I will list a few hygienic rules concerning this.

1.  It is not advisable to smell strong fragrances or odors for too long, as prolonged exposure can numb the olfactory nerves and impair their normal function.

2.  Excessive cigarette smoking should be avoided, as it can dull the sense of smell.

3.  Avoid sudden transitions from cold to hot places, or from excessively hot places to excessively cold places, as this can cause nasal congestion, and even lead to colds and other illnesses.

4.  Do not shave your nose hairs during haircuts, as they serve as a natural protector for the nose, blocking foreign objects from entering directly and regulating the temperature of the air during breathing.

5.  On days when the air is dry, wipe the inside of the nasal cavity with a damp cloth or warm water.

6.  If the nose is accidentally injured and bleeds, take steps to stop it. There are two methods: (1) A passive method: insert a soft piece of paper or cotton into the nostril. At the same time, lie with your head tilted back and place a cold, wet towel on your forehead; (2) An active method: pour cold water into the nasal cavity to gradually constrict the blood vessels, which will stop the bleeding on its own. If it does not stop, seek medical attention immediately to avoid delay.

(4) Hygiene of the Tongue: This small piece of tongue also requires a discussion of its hygiene. The hygiene of the tongue refers to how to protect the taste function of the tongue. I will list a few points as follows:

1.  Extremely cold or hot food and beverages can impair taste, so pay attention to this first.

2.  Be careful not to bite your tongue while chewing, as this can spoil your enjoyment of food.

3.  Excessive smoking and drinking can dull the sense of taste. Young friends who love smoking and drinking should take note.

4.  Favoring one particular flavor in food can easily lead to habituation and dull the sense of taste.

5.  When there is a coating on the tongue, it is often difficult to distinguish the taste of food. Apart from illness, working or engaging in nighttime entertainment often leads to a coated tongue. Mahjong enthusiasts should pay attention to this.

(5) Hygiene of the Skin: This was previously mentioned in the section on excretory hygiene, so please refer to the above article. However, people in certain occupations should pay attention to the skin or sensory function used for touch. For example, doctors can examine the condition of internal organs by palpating through the skin and muscles. In entertainment, people who enjoy mahjong often use their fingertips to feel for certain tiles.

### Personnel and Treatment in the Public Health Sector

— Yu Zhengxing

Some people say, "In China, things are set up according to the person, while in foreign countries, people are used according to the task." It can be seen that Chinese society is centered on personnel. In Chinese administration, the focus is on whether the relationships between people are harmonious, rather than on whether the institutions are closely connected. Therefore, the success or failure of an undertaking depends on the "person," not on the organization, plan, or method. Naturally, "the government thrives when the person is present, and the government ceases when the person is gone" has been regarded as a classic!

In Chinese society, there are not only factions, but also cliques within factions, and subgroups within cliques. When faction A gains power, faction B is abandoned. When faction B comes to power, faction A is dismissed. Therefore, "when one person gains power, ten thousand people enjoy blessings." The existence of this phenomenon only intensifies mutual suspicion and contradictions, and cancels out strength. It only deepens the decay of matters and provides no benefit. This should be broken.

We often find that the same people receive different treatment. In the same area, one may be ranked high in organization A, but the opposite may be true in organization B. Naturally, it is even more different in different places. The difference between local and central governments is often quite large. Of course, this is a method of encouraging advancement in local work, but the excessive difference in ranks can disrupt the personnel system. I also agree with rewarding those who have worked in local areas for a long time, but I oppose destroying the integrity of a system. In particular, the treatment enjoyed by many people who use factional relationships or nepotism is different. This is despised by those with aspirations and considered shameful by those with blood!

In the entire public health sector, the issue of treatment shows inequality. In fact, the general treatment is already low, which is undeniable. However, some receive an additional 30% or 50% based on the salary standard, while others receive nothing at all. We also see that within the same organization, some are given increases due to different work departments. This unequal treatment, displayed before our eyes, will inevitably stimulate work emotions and affect work efficiency. At the very least, it will be believed that the public health sector is either corrupt or bureaucratic. The hopelessness of the future is evident.

Having drafted this, based on my limited views, I make the following suggestions:

1.  Value Talent and Do Not Rely on Factions: Now I would like to quote Mr. Hu Dingan's words, which I believe have already been seen. Scholarship has no national boundaries, and truth has no two paths. Those engaged in academic work must first have a broad mind and a humble heart, eliminate personal feelings, and choose with an open mind. As the saying goes, "White can be accepted and adopted, and sweet can be accepted and harmonized." Moreover, given the current situation in our country, with so few medical talents, such a great social need, such urgent suffering of the people awaiting relief, and such a thirst for medical academic knowledge, we should unite our strength and focus our will. Among colleagues, we must not have a sense of superiority or narrow-minded views. We should have fairness and integrity, and reasonable strategies to reduce the childish behavior of currying favor with those in power, and increase the friendly emotions of being kind and approachable. We should uphold the spirit of "scholarship deepens when temper is calm," widely connect, and sweep away the previous factional concepts and prejudices for the sake of medical scholarship. Now is the time to show the bright attitude of "clouds disappearing and smoke scattering, the sun rising and the sky becoming clear," the so-called "all under heaven are one family." We should select the virtuous and employ the capable, so that people can be matched with appropriate tasks, and tasks are suitable for people. This should be the strategy for employing people in the future, and we can no longer repeat the past, with uneven work and leisure, and unbalanced power, which hindered the progress of undertakings.

2.  Establish a New Personnel System: The foundation for selecting the virtuous and employing the capable lies in knowing people well and making good use of them, and using people in a fair and reasonable manner. Today, putting the word "private" at the beginning has led to the advancement of petty people and the alienation of the virtuous. In the medical and public health sector, it is necessary to establish good discipline in the future, and the personnel system must be rebuilt. On the one hand, their professions should be guaranteed, and on the other hand, their functions should be defined. So that a technical person will not be rejected in their work due to personal feelings. In terms of treatment, if a certain treatment can be enjoyed in place A, the same treatment should be available in place B, without the situation of place A being too high and place B being too low. At the same time, we should prevent opportunistic people from finding opportunities and seeking luck. Whether it is central or local, all should be equal, with no special cases. Naturally, giving special subsidies and allowances to those who work in local areas should be considered separately. However, its basic principles should not be allowed to be shaken, and should be consistent throughout the country, without further divergence.

3.  Encourage Young Talents: Many people see themselves as loving, cultivating, and promoting young people, but in reality, they are the least understanding of young people, and even use and destroy them. As a result, many young people become disheartened. Many young people with ideals and hopes, who are kind-hearted, are unfortunately tortured, and become "prematurely mature" with a gray attitude, abandoning hope, giving up ideals, drifting with the tide, and following the old ways. We believe that this is not only the misfortune of the young people themselves, but also the misfortune of society and the misfortune of undertakings. Therefore, for a new young person, if they are recognized as having potential, creativity, and a future, they must be taught, supported, and molded, so that they become people with hope and greater achievements. A person's age is limited, and in the process of transition between the old and the new, the continuation of undertakings and the discovery of ideals must rely on the efforts of young people. Therefore, cultivating young talents is necessary, and this is the only way to have hope for the future of China's medical and public health undertakings.

4.  Improve the Treatment of Medical Personnel: "Not starving to death, not eating enough, not freezing to death, not wearing warm clothes" has become a common saying among public servants. However, those with many children are in danger of starving and freezing to death. Five months ago, a doctor who graduated in 1942 expressed his willingness to serve the country's public health work, regardless of remuneration or position, but could not fully devote himself to public service. This is because he can earn 4 million yuan a month by practicing for three hours a day. This shows that the treatment of technical personnel is too low, and daily life cannot be maintained. Even if they are willing to serve the government, for the sake of "life," they cannot but seek their own way out and plan to practice privately. Therefore, I hope that the government will reward technical personnel generously. "You can't expect a horse to run fast without feeding it." If a technical person is worried about food, clothing, and housing, how can he have the mind to research, invent, or treat patients with peace of mind? It is simply a pipe dream. An enlightened administrative authority should ensure that these medical and public health technical personnel have a stable life, so that they can work hard for their careers with peace of mind. At the same time, only in this way can outstanding talents be recruited. In the future, when the public medical system is implemented, managing private practice and banning private practice without improving treatment will probably still fail. Quickly improve and stabilize the lives of medical personnel!

"Employing one capable person is better than employing ten rice-eaters." In order to pursue work efficiency and hope for the development of undertakings, whether in terms of personnel or treatment, it is more beneficial to obtain a capable talent at a high price than a "cheap" fool. Therefore, in the future, in terms of personnel, we should not only select the virtuous and employ the capable, reward the good and punish the bad, but also cultivate capable talents and recruit capable talents. Whether in terms of systems, facilities, or treatment, we should provide convenience for capable talents. If we value talent in this way, the people will be motivated, seek practicality, and not be fond of false fame, and there will naturally be hope for building undertakings.

Some may think that what I have discussed above is a problem of the entire Chinese society, and not just the medical and public health sector. If the entire society is not improved, single-sided efforts may have little hope. I believe that this is the prevailing thought of "following the old ways," and this is the idea of being birds of a feather flocking together. If the medical and public health sector, as an academic and professional group, does not first correct itself as a demonstration, and uses the entire society as an excuse, it really shows that it is not making progress. And this lack of progress, existing in academic and professional groups, is shameful!

In order to pave a smooth road for the implementation of the public medical system, it is right and proper to demand the rationalization of the personnel system and to demand the improvement of the treatment of medical personnel. Government authorities who care about the health of the nation, legislators who pay attention to the prosperity of the country, pay attention, pay attention to improvement!

### Wang Tao, the "状元 of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and His Works

— Shen Dingjun

Formerly Collected the Juju Zhenban Series for This Newspaper

Wang Tao, originally named Wan, styled Libin, sobriquet Lanjun, also known as Lanqing, and Ziju. Later, in his autobiography, he also said that his original name was Libin, which was changed to Han, styled Lanjin. He was from Changzhou, Wu, and his family lived in Fuli. He sat for the imperial examination but was registered in Xinyang. Therefore, in the records of Kunxin Qingying, there is Wang Han's inscription. After his letter to the Taiping army was discovered, he changed his name to Tao, styled Ziquan (also written as Quan), sobriquet Zhongtao, and in his later years he retired to Guangdong, calling himself the Hermit of Tiannan. He was born in the eighth year of the Qing Dynasty's Daoguang reign (1828 AD) and died in the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign (1890 AD), at the age of sixty-three. His father's name was Xixian, sobriquet Youzhi, who was also a Xinyang graduate. His mother, Zhu, gave birth to two sons and one daughter, with Tao being the second son. His sister married into a certain Wu family in Wujun, and his younger brother's name was Guiqing, who died young, leaving a widow and an orphan. Wang Tao's first wife was Yang, styled Mengheng, and his second wife was Lin. After marrying Wang Tao, Tao renamed her Huaiheng to show that he did not forget his first wife. Yang was the daughter of the local Lian Caiting and the sister of the talent Xintuan. This relationship between Wang and Yang is not known in detail even by the Yang descendants today. Tao had only one daughter and no son. His daughter married into the Qian family of Wucheng, and later made his daughter's son his grandson, calling him Youquan.

In his youth, he truly suffered from poverty and illness. All the expenses for medicine and other things were provided by his mother's pawning of belongings and diligent spinning. He was very fond of books and studied together with his fellow villager Xu Qi (styled Renhu) under the tutelage of Jinxi Di Mingjing. (There is the Chaoshi Poetry Collection, also by a fellow villager, who happened to be residing in Jinxi. Jinxi is another name for Chenmu.) Tao was unrestrained in nature and looked down on everything. At the age of twenty-two, he suffered the loss of his father, and his family became even poorer. He went to Shanghai alone and served at the Mohai Printing Bureau run by the Englishman Walter Henry Medhurst, holding a very low position, and spent several years in depression.

In his nineteenth year, Wang Tao failed the Jinling examination and abandoned writing exam essays, resolving to study the classics and history. However, he enjoyed wandering and, while sitting for the examination in Jinling, he became acquainted with two schoolmistresses, Ren Suqin and Miao Aixiang. When he saw the famous courtesans He Xiang and Suqing on the Huai River, he was also fascinated. In the preface to his self-edited "Anecdotes of Romance," he also said, "When I was young, I liked to write oblique sentences, and I was proficient as soon as I put pen to paper." In his "Heng Hua Guan Poetry Record," there is a dream poem with the line, "The blue courtyard and red walls were originally close, but coming again may not be separated from the human world." And he wrote of excitement, "New thin gauze is still afraid of heat, secretly wiping fragrant sweat to avoid strangers." These two poems are very charming. In his twenty-fourth year, his pleasure trips became even more frequent, with flower selections and song invitations every day, and his unrestrained reputation became known for a time. In the preface to his "Record of Leisurely Travels in Hai Zou," he also said, "In the spring of Xinhai (the ninth year of Xianfeng), I engaged in some pleasure trips, and my unrestrained reputation suddenly became known. I selected flowers, opened wine, invited songs, and tapped the beat. I wrote articles on skirts and asked for fans, and I was indifferent to transmission. Therefore, the clinging catkins became duckweed drifting with the water." After reading the above poems and articles, one can see his tender feelings and thoughts.

Wang Tao was very depressed when he failed the examination in his early years. Moreover, with the corruption of the Qing government and the growing momentum of the Taiping army, he used the name "Huang Wan" in the first year of Tongzhi to write a letter to Li Xiucheng, the loyal king of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, advising him to make peace with foreign countries and use foreign forces to conquer the Central Plains, and offering a plan to seize Shanghai. Unfortunately, the loyal king did not adopt it, but from then on, there was a misrepresentation of Wang Tao as the "状元 of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Later, the book he submitted was obtained when the Qing army broke through the seven fortresses, and he was ordered to be arrested. He escaped to Shanghai and received the protection of the Westerner Walter Henry Medhurst. He responded to the call of his Western friend James Legge and, in August of that year, took his family to Guangdong, and later lived in Hong Kong for two years. In the sixth year of Tongzhi, he traveled with his Western friend James Legge to Scotland in England to translate and revise Chinese classics. Later, he traveled to various Western countries and was welcomed by people there. He returned to China in the ninth year of Tongzhi and still hid in Hong Kong, not daring to return home. In the twelfth year of Tongzhi, the Hong Kong "Circulation Daily" was founded, and he served as its editor. In the fifth year of Guangxu, he traveled to Japan and had close contact with Japanese literati. In the eighth year of Guangxu, he returned to Shanghai and returned home once to talk with Xu Qi and others about their separation. Two years later, he moved his family from Hong Kong to Shanghai and took the position of editor at the Shen Bao newspaper office, and founded a woodblock movable type printing office in Shanghai, called the Tao Yuan Bookstore. - Xu Qi's "Xing Hu She Diao Tan" was printed with the bookstore's woodblock movable type. In the thirteenth year of Guangxu, he was already sixty years old and served as the head of the Shanghai Gezhi Academy. He reversed the previous academy's practice of teaching scholars with classics and history and instead taught people to focus on science, hoping to store materials for the country and turn the weak Qing court into a strong one.

In his later years, Wang Tao saw that the world was becoming more and more wrong, so he devoted himself to writing. If we flip through the "Literary Examination" of the Wuxian Chronicle, we will see that Wang Tao's records are about thirty or more kinds, more than 370 volumes. Not only can it be said that his writings are as tall as his body, but he is also knowledgeable in both Chinese and Western cultures. The books he wrote are recorded as follows:

Sixty volumes of "Collected Explanations of the Spring and Autumn Zuo Tradition," three volumes of "Examination of the Spring and Autumn Shuo Wang and Months," one volume of "Discrimination and Correction of the Spring and Autumn Solar Eclipse," one volume of "Spring and Autumn Shuo Wang Table," twenty-four volumes of "Collated Notes on the Imperial Qing Classic Explanations," one hundred and twenty volumes of "Four Ming Supplements," eight volumes of "National Dynasty Classic Records" (also written as twelve volumes), one volume of "Brief Records of China-England Trade," three volumes of "Taiwan Affairs Secret Anger Records" (also written as four volumes), six volumes of "Ying Yuan Miscellaneous Records," twenty volumes of "Re-edited Record of the Franco-Prussian War," twelve volumes of "Record of the North and South American War," four volumes of "Western Ancient History," four volumes of "Western Affairs," twelve volumes of "Re-edited French Strategy" (also written as twenty-four volumes), six volumes of "Record of Travel to Japan" (also written as three volumes), eight volumes of "Random Notes on Wandering" (with illustrations), twelve volumes of "Song Yin Miscellaneous Records" (with illustrations), eight volumes of "Yu Yong Yu Tan," twelve volumes of "Dunku Jiangyan," one volume of "Lao Xiang Zhui Yu," one volume of "Elementary Explanation of Heavy Learning," three volumes of "Firearm Flow," one volume of "Origin of Western Astronomy," one volume of "Optical Illustration," one volume of "Outline of the New Learning of Gewu," one volume of "Examination of Western Works," six volumes of "Heng Hua Guan Poetry," four volumes of "Mei Zhu Ci Chao," eight volumes of "Tao Yuan Chi Du Xu Chao," twelve volumes of "Tao Yuan Chi Du," twelve volumes of "Tao Yuan Wenlu Wai Bian."

In addition, the National Beiping Library has seven volumes of Wang Tao's handwritten books, including Eastern Travel Draft Records and Hua Guan Diary, and fragments of reading notes. (See Beiping Wax Museum Journal) Of the above books, I have only seen a few. And in the preface to his Huayang San Gao, written in the ninth year of Guangxu, he said: "A fire last year reduced half of my life's writings to ashes." Judging from this, Wang Tao's works must have been lost a lot, and it is difficult to grasp the whole picture.

Looking at Wang Tao's life as a whole, although he was poor in his youth, lived in exile in middle age, and was frail in his old age, he was unable to develop his ambitions and died with regret. However, the friends he made were all famous figures at home and abroad. Wherever his footprints went, except for the New World, there were traces of him. Moreover, his writings were so rich that he was truly admirable. He was truly a strange figure of his generation! In his personal life, although he enjoyed pleasure trips, he strongly opposed concubinage to continue the family line and advocated the system of one husband and one wife. He also despised the stereotypical essays of the imperial examination, although he may have felt this way because he failed the examination. However, in view of the daily decline of national affairs and the uselessness of exam essays, he dared to publicly oppose the career that the whole country regarded as a path to advancement, which also shows his extraordinary courage and knowledge. However, after his letter to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was exposed, he still repeatedly defended himself, hoping for something, which was a bit too enthusiastic about fame and profit.

Wang Tao once collected the Juju Zhenban Series for this newspaper. In the preface to his "Dun Ku Yan," he said:

"In the year Yihai, the owner of Zunwen Pavilion had the ambition to collect books of strange records, and sought me out. I returned to Yixiepu, and made friends with those overseas. I traveled to the Pearl River, and selected from them directly."

Yihai was the first year of the Qing Dynasty's Guangxu reign. Since he said "traveled to the Pearl River," it is thought that his traces were still in Lingfu. This is a self-description, so it should be reliable history. The rest are not recorded in the literature. (This Newspaper Data Room)

### On Literary Criticism

— Hu Guangdong

One

In a Chinese society that is poor in literary works, literary criticism, which is the task of promoting the content of literary works, also appears desolate. The problem with current literary criticism is the lack of critical spirit, in other words, the attitude of critics is not objective enough and not enthusiastic enough.

Two

Lu Xun once said, "What we need are solid, clear, and truly knowledgeable critics of social science and literary theory." Indeed, if a literary critic lacks a knowledge of social science and does not understand the social life factors in literary works, then I can guarantee that his excavation work will be low-energy and slow.

The conditions that a critic must possess are a service-oriented outlook on life and a scientific worldview. This can be said to be the weapon of criticism and the measuring instrument of truth.

Three

Creators are workers, and critics are mentors. This so-called mentor is not a pedantic old gentleman whose enthusiasm has waned, but a person who possesses rich knowledge and enthusiasm. With his strength, he can point out the direction that literary workers should take.

Excavating the value of the works of warriors can be said to be the main task of critics. Shi Nai'an's "Water Margin," Cao Xueqin's "Dream of the Red Chamber," Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," Goethe's "Faust," Gorky's "Mother," etc., these works were able to become immortal works in the minds of the people because they were the result of repeated criticism by critics. It can also be said that this is the result of the critics' excavation.

Critics are sensitive to the general readers.

Four

Those who talk about means cannot become critics because criticism is never about praising to the heavens or suppressing to the depths, but about extremely fair and serious analysis.

Criticism has depth. Superficial criticism, merely scratching the surface, is worth zero in terms of value. Critics stand on the basis of scientific and objective judgment and radiate unparalleled heat and emotion towards literary works.

Five

In a stagnant society, we look forward to the emergence of good works and solid, objective literary criticism.

### Miscellaneous Writings from a Waterside Village in Early Summer

Pond

A small pond, a sparkling pond, a lovely green pond. —

In recent days, this pond has become so beautiful, so charming. This pond has become so beautiful and so charming with the changing seasons and the arrival of the vigorous and abundant summer.

The small bushes on the edge of the pond cover it with a dense, cool, green shade. The green duckweed blooms with small white flowers, sparsely scattered throughout the pond. Newborn fish come to the surface in groups to frolic, without any concern. At dawn and dusk, this pond is even more the arena of the good singing frogs, broadcasting enthusiastic summer hymns. ...

I say that the pond is an elegant little window of the season. In the time of the arrival of this vigorous and abundant summer, the pond is full of life, full of color and sound.

Lake

The lake is the eye of the earth, the mirror of the universe.

The lake in early summer is full of green water. The lake light in early summer is so bright that it is hard to open your eyes.

The lake has an open and cheerful mind that can contain everything:

A mountain, a corner pavilion, a cloud, a sail, a flying bird, a falling sunset, can all cast their traces here for a while or a long time.

The people who live by the lake love the lake; the lake also loves these people who live near it.

The lake reflects the lives of the people by the lake: content with poverty and happy with the Way. The fate of the lake and the people by the lake are tied together.

### Swallows Fly in Pairs

— Xie Caiqin

### Small Courtyard

— Xuan Jianren

In the small courtyard, some flowers are planted. I can't quite name them, but their colors are red, yellow, purple, white... competing for beauty. Butterflies and dragonflies fly around, making the small courtyard lively. The walnut tree from the neighbor's yard leans over, its leaves lush and green, with young green fruits hanging on the branches, three or two... so endearing.

In the morning, I look at the flowers; each flower has glistening dewdrops. Flowers bloom and wither; isn't life also like this? They say flowers can understand language; can they understand my melancholy? At night, I enjoy the cool breeze in the small courtyard. The chirping of insects in the corner of the wall reminds me of the troubles of life. I think of a string of lost colorful dreams, and I sigh.

Suddenly, I look up to see a sky full of stars.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 333

— Ye Jingfeng

It turns out that at this time, the American intelligence department had discovered that this dock worker was actually the third prince of Germany, a valuable asset. Exchanging him for four high-ranking military officers was worthwhile, and the German side was very flexible, even willing to add further incentives. However, the American intelligence department had other plans. They weren't concerned about the additional incentives but demanded that Germany first hand over the four captured generals to the Swiss Foreign Ministry for safekeeping. Secretly, they also made arrangements to secretly assign a top-notch spy, disguised as a low-ranking officer who didn't understand a word of German, to sneakily release the third prince from prison. The condition was to escort the third prince back to Germany, in exchange for a reward and a military rank.

At that time, Germany's spy network in the United States was quite extensive. As long as he could get out of prison, escaping back to Germany wouldn't be a problem. Furthermore, the American intelligence department provided special assistance, allowing them to steal a small airplane to fly to Mexico, and then take a train to Brazil in South America. Once in Brazil, a German submarine would be waiting to take them back home.

Why did the American intelligence department do this? The reason was to easily send this top-notch spy to Germany, disguised as the third prince's savior. From then on, the American spy lurking in Berlin had a new force to rely on and could even access the heavily guarded German military headquarters. (This is also a single-line operation).

The reason for mentioning this episode is to explain that when a special-class spy "single-line" operative appears, there must be a fixed posture. For example, the German third prince appears in a low-level social role, such as a dock worker, changing his name and hiding among the dock workers. However, in the German high-level spy headquarters' records, there must be a file for this third prince, with a note. This file and note, apart from the minister in charge of spies, for the sake of strict secrecy and the safety of the spy, internal secrets, no one can know, only the headquarters' single line, directly connected abroad. As for the spy dispatched by the United States, he appears as a military traitor. Only the highest authority and the minister know about this. Although the scandalous news of this traitor spread like wildfire, it was merely a smokescreen.

But it should be understood that the actions and procedures for sending out spies in this way are relatively simple; however, if something goes wrong and rescue is needed, how is this secret instruction conveyed? Outsiders, looking at it from the perspective of movies and novels, think that using wireless code or other means of communication to deliver the instruction to the location of the incident abroad is a success. However, in reality, there are no such convenient and simple things. Moreover, military procedures are extremely complex, and spy operations and instruction delivery are even more complex than military ones.

There are, of course, pre-arranged methods for delivering instructions, which we won't discuss. But what is the actual form of the instruction? The first point is naturally the code. Is this code so easy to use? First, it must be subtle; second, it must be clear and definite; and third, it must be brief. These three conditions are troublesome enough. The only way to meet these three conditions is to use a substitute name method, just like algebra uses ABC and XY.

Shanghai Jottings

### American Independence Day

— Shilang

Today is American Independence Day, and we would like to use this short article to express our congratulations.

The American people freed themselves from the shackles of their nation and, with perseverance, defeated the British and declared independence. Now, there are one hundred and seventy-one years of history.

The American people—this glorious nation—deserve admiration for their boldness and straightforwardness; they never fear hardship, and they never bow their heads to obstacles. In the Second World War, thanks to its uniquely favorable environment and abundant resources, America today is leading the way, guiding the nations of the world toward freedom and peace.

But the whole world now has a kind of anxiety, thinking that the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union is inevitable, and that a third, more cruel, and more cold-blooded world war will definitely break out. With the current intense gunpowder atmosphere in the international arena, and the sharp exchanges in the diplomatic maneuvering between the United States and the Soviet Union, the strong wording gives every nerve ending in the world a terrible premonition:

"War is unavoidable!"

Every chess piece, every step, and every angle reveals the tense stance between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Has the color of war really formed? Must the soldiers who have just washed away the blood from the trenches and suffered physical and mental trauma cross another battlefield?

This seems too cruel. In order to maintain the progress of the world and human culture, the American people and their wise leaders have a heavy responsibility to remove the smog-filled barriers before them!

Free Discussion

### Confucius's Teachings Are Not Outdated

— Jin Changkang

After reading Mr. Lu Xun's article "Duke Zhou and Confucius" a few days ago, I was filled with sympathy. We see that the troubles and disasters of the world today are caused by a lack of respect for Confucianism and a lack of understanding of the Confucian classics. This is a fact, not outdated thinking. Why? Because Confucius shouted for human justice!

Basing his teachings on the truth of the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, and Man), he established classics and teachings, and formulated the great laws for governing the world, not just to pass on his own writings. It should be known that there is only one truth in the world. Because it is the truth, and because there is only one, it has no temporal, racial, or regional limitations. Therefore, Confucius's classics and teachings are so vast that the world cannot contain them, and so small that the world cannot break them. They are accurate wherever they are applied, stand upright between heaven and earth, and can be a model for all ages. That is their meaning.

We must also recognize that Confucius's teachings are to teach people to follow the truth of humanity, to promote human progress, and to create a world of great harmony and peace, with absolutely no outdated elements. The "Zhong Yong" (Doctrine of the Mean) says: "Confucius said: To like to act on one's own opinions, and to be fond of taking one's own way without advice, though one may be of low station and mean employment, will bring calamity upon one's self." How thoroughly he speaks! But since the time of Confucius until now, this world has been circulating and killing each other, progressing from a local to a global scale. The science of killing has progressed from ignorance to the point of almost destroying the entire world. This evolution of humans devouring each other is all caused by selfishness and self-reliance. It is even more savage than the primitive barbarism, destroying the path of human justice and opening up the demonic path of advancing in name but retreating in reality, and a lack of rational progression. All this is not allowed by Confucius's classics and teachings, so they are demoted to the ranks of the foolish and contemptible. The so-called "To be born in the present age and turn back to the ways of the ancients; such a course will bring calamity upon oneself" is Confucius's theory of evolution. The main point is to teach people not to drive backwards. However, Confucius taught people not to drive backwards, with standards and without blind following. So he does not use the words new and old to make judgments of right and wrong. Therefore, he said, "Review the old and know the new." Only in this way will one not obliterate the truth because of the new.

### Summer Night—Talking About Fireflies

— Yiren

At night, I was enjoying the cool breeze in the garden with my children. Fireflies flew by, flashing their light. The children eagerly used their fans to swat at them, catching many and putting them in a bottle to play with.

The older child, who loves to read, told his younger sisters the story of Che Yin reading by fireflies. They didn't believe it, saying, "How can such a small light from a firefly be used to read?" The older child said, "If you gather enough of them, just like the ancients said, 'A gathering of mosquitoes can become thunder,' then we can also gather fireflies to become electricity." Hearing this new idiom, "gather fireflies to become electricity," I couldn't help but laugh, thinking that his two years in high school hadn't been in vain. A little girl, who was in the fifth grade of elementary school, pestered me to tell her a story about fireflies too.

I suddenly remembered Yuan Shikai's strange act with fireflies, so I said to them, "The story I'm going to tell is the opposite of what your brother told you. When Yuan Shikai was young, he was most afraid of studying. The teacher beat him, and he hated the teacher, so he secretly planned to harm him. One night, he waited by the side of the road that the teacher had to pass on his way home. The grass by the road was very deep, hiding his small body. A few days before, he had stored a whole bottle of fireflies. At this time, he poured them all out, rubbed them with his hands, and then smeared them all over his face, so that his face was covered with flashing firefly light, like a monster with a shining face. When the teacher's footsteps slowly approached from afar, he suddenly jumped out of the bushes, catching the poor teacher off guard, scaring him so much that he fell ill when he got home."

The children laughed for a while, and then scolded Yuan Shikai for being a bad guy. The older child said, "No wonder he wanted to be an emperor and betray the country later. It turns out he was a big villain when he was a child."

"There was another emperor who had an interesting encounter with fireflies, and that was Emperor Yang of Sui. In the summer, he issued an order in Jinghua Palace, requisitioning dozens of bushels of fireflies. As a result, every family in the capital sent people to the countryside to catch them. It took several days to satisfy the emperor's desire. Do you know what Emperor Yang did with these dozens of bushels of fireflies? He took all the flying fireflies to the top of a high mountain and released them all at once, so that tens of thousands of small lights flew all over the mountains and fields. There seemed to be more of them than the stars in the sky. It was really fun!"

"Why was Emperor Yang being playful like a child?" the little girl asked.

"Many ancient emperors were great villains, who loved to waste the strength of the people to satisfy their personal entertainment. Emperor Yang's antics were relatively harmless, but other emperors did many things that were very harmful to the people, which are too numerous to tell. Yuan Shikai's story of using fireflies to scare the teacher is of course extremely hateful. The reason we oppose autocratic emperors is that many of them love to do unreasonable, cruel, and vicious things." I thus reached a small conclusion for the children's firefly stories.

### The Troubles of American Veterans

— Gongtao

An American veteran wrote a letter to the representative of Indiana, in which he said:

"The army stipulates that after I return home, I can no longer wear my uniform, otherwise I will be considered 'impersonating a soldier.' But the shop assistants tell me that they don't have clothes that fit me, and the policemen say that I can't walk naked on the street, saying it's illegal. I'd also like not to go out, but I can't find a house to live in, and I can't even buy a wooden bucket because of the lack of wood. I was injured, so my physique is not up to standard, and I can't rejoin the army. What can I do!?"

### Thinking of the Good Old Days

— Hulu

The rise of thieves

Strange news is constantly seen in the newspapers. I once heard of robbers building foreign-style houses; I also heard of thieves contributing good fields; thieves are actually dressed as rich old men!

Excellent brains, kind hearts, it is difficult for this world to avoid hunger! How many empty-handed masters are there, accustomed to cleverly hiding their clothes and hats!

### The Red Hair Country

— Ji Ming

When Jian Qizi did not mention Wang Yuyang, the "Luan Yang Xia Xia Lu" (Luan Yang Summer Records) all contained stories of the "Red Hair Country," roughly saying that the people of the Red Hair Country were good at sailing and at recognizing treasures. However, they were of a dark and alarming nature, fond of killing and stealing property, so although they repeatedly requested mutual trade, the Chinese court did not permit it. That year, merchants from the Red Hair Country requested from the local officials that they be granted a piece of land to serve as their lodge. The local officials granted it, but when the opened the clothes to view, they had spread several acres of land, the residents relied on translation, and were looted and went. I examined this "Red Hair Country", which is now Portugal. Earlier, in the fourteenth year of Jiajing during the Ming Dynasty, the military commander Huang Qing, due to bribes from the Portuguese, requested that Macau be used as a trading port, marking the beginning of the Portuguese entering Macau for mutual trade. Later, in the thirty-second year of Jiajing, the Portuguese merchants used the excuse that their tribute goods had been flooded and requested land to dry them, thus occupying an increasing amount of land. In the first year of Wanli during the reign of Emperor Shenzong, Macau officials once again accepted bribes from the Portuguese, building a wall at the narrowest point of the Macau Peninsula as a boundary, with the Portuguese paying a rent of five hundred taels, marking the origin of the Portuguese rule over Macau today. What is recorded in the books of Yuan and Wang may be a mistake from the thirty-second year of Jiajing. Both gentlemen considered themselves to be learned Confucians, yet their ignorance of "foreign affairs" is evident here. Today, there have been repeated discussions about the return of Macau, but the Portuguese have procrastinated, and have not been able to grasp the key points. I wonder if the people of the Red Hair Country today are still like those described in the past?

### American Miscellany

— Xu Shuyuan

Courtesy and Reciprocity in America

Chinese old scholars have a saying, "If etiquette is lost, seek it among the barbarians." Like China, an ancient country with 5,000 years of culture, everyone has read the "Book of Rites" in vain, so that students do not greet their teachers when they see them, and sons do not bow to their fathers. Instead, the Americans' Sir, Daddy, and Honey sound so polite. The "Young man, this way is polite" seen on the Chinese opera stage was originally a tactic for dealing with women, and no one said it to a teacher or father.

Americans value etiquette the most, but they are not exaggerated. They must send greeting cards every season for celebrations and birthdays. These greeting cards cost from five cents to one dollar each. It is a gift but cannot be considered a heavy gift. The Chinese way of giving gifts is different, and there are some banks that cast gold into loquats to send during the Dragon Boat Festival, which has degenerated from etiquette to bribery. The "etiquette" mentioned in the Book of Rites has long been lost, and maybe that "etiquette" has crossed the ocean to America.

There are many kinds of gifts that Chinese people give, including cars and foreign-style houses, American dollars and gold bars, bank gift certificates, and beautiful concubines and beautiful concubines. Gifts from Americans include greeting cards, chocolates, cosmetics, jewelry, and clothing items. Men can buy bras and shorts for their lovers; women can buy pajamas and slippers for their lovers. This kind of gift, at most a few US dollars, is already a very generous gift. Some parents send watches or graduation commemorative rings to their daughters in college, and some send pianos, which is a wealthy style and not very common, but pianos in America cost only three or four hundred dollars, which is only the price of a gold loquat.

Scientific Essays

### Swallowtail Butterfly

— Jia Zuzhang

"Eyebrows curled like iron wire, wings haloed with golden jade, it comes first to vie with the beauty of flowers, suddenly goes, leaving no trace like a ghost."

Su Shi's poem about the ghost butterfly is about what the "Gu Jin Zhu" (Notes of Antiquity and the Present) calls "having a size as big as a bat, or black, or with blue spots, named Fengzi (Phoenix Child), also named Fengche (Phoenix Chariot), also named Guiche (Ghost Chariot), living in Jiangnan citrus orchards." Now general zoology books call it the swallowtail butterfly, probably derived from the two names Fengzi and Fengche. The "Guihai Chongyu Zhi" (Records of Insects and Fish of Guihai) calls it "Guiren Yun Yuanwu Chan (Ghost Man Cloud Dark Cicada)," which clearly still refers to the swallowtail butterfly.

Now, folklore says it is the incarnation of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, and there is a tragic love story circulating. Zhu Yingtai was an only daughter. Her parents loved her like a pearl in their palm and treated her like a son. She wore men's clothing and studied in the school, just like Mulan joining the army, and was not recognized. Usually, she had the best relationship with her classmate Liang Shanbo, and over time, love developed, but Liang Shanbo did not know. Later, Zhu Yingtai quit school and returned home, and became ill, troubling her parents to seek medical treatment in various ways, but with no effect. It was not until her condition became critical that Zhu Yingtai revealed her innermost thoughts. When her parents heard this, they hurriedly sent someone to notify Liang Shanbo. However, clouds and mountains blocked the way, and the journey was long. By the time Liang Shanbo arrived, Zhu Yingtai had already passed away. Liang Shanbo, with a sad and guilty heart, went to the grave to mourn, and the grave suddenly cracked open, burying Liang Shanbo. Zhu Yingtai's parents hurriedly hired people to excavate, but they did not find their bodies, only a pair of beautiful butterflies flying out. From then on, they could often be seen flying together on flowers. This story was already recorded in the Ming Dynasty, and can be found in the "Shantang Skao," which says: "It is popularly said that large butterflies must be in pairs, which are the souls of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. It is also said that the souls of couples can be turned into butterflies, which is all incomprehensible."

As for the story of Han Ping and his wife, it originated earlier than the story of Liang Shanbo and his wife, and is found in the "Sou Shen Ji" (Records of Searching for Spirits), which says: "The Song official Yu Ping married a beautiful woman, but King Kang of Song seized her. Ping committed suicide. His wife secretly rotted her clothes, climbed the stage with the king, and threw herself off the stage. The people on the left and right grabbed her, but their hands turned into trees." It is also said that they turned into mandarin ducks (see my book Birds and Literature). Whether they turn into mandarin ducks or butterflies, they are symbols of deep human feelings.

The swallowtail butterfly is a family of large and beautiful butterflies, with the hind wings extended into tails, generally flying gracefully, like a phoenix, so it is named Fengzi. The larvae are harmful to citrus leaves and are easily found in gardens, relatively close to humans, and easily attract attention.

But such a beautiful and common butterfly, with beautiful names such as Fengzi, has rarely been cited in Chinese literature. According to the "Wenchang Zalu," only Han Hen's poems have used the word Fengzi. The poem is "Goose sips female yellow mouth, Phoenix child lightly and gracefully paints waist." In just seven characters, the characteristics of the swallowtail butterfly are vividly described.

As for being called the ghost butterfly, it is probably related to the legend that Han Ping or Liang Shanbo and his wife turned into butterflies after their deaths; or because its color is black.
