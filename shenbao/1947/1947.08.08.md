### Preliminary Conference on the Peace Treaty with Japan Set for September 10th; US Attempting to Reconcile Differing Views Among Nations

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, July 7th (Broadcast) – According to well-informed sources, the preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan has been set for September 10th to avoid conflicting with the dates of the United Nations General Assembly. If the Soviet Union continues to insist on its original proposal, the conference will be held without Soviet participation. It is reported that Britain and Australia have suggested that the initial talks be conducted by foreign ministers, a proposal to which the US has expressed agreement.

[Central News Agency, Washington, July 6th] – Marshall stated today that the United States has received replies from ten countries regarding the US invitation to convene a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan. While the countries hold differing views on how to proceed, they all agree on the need for swift action. Marshall said at a press conference today that the United States has not yet responded to the suggestions made by various countries regarding future attendance at the conference. The US is seeking a way to reconcile these differing views. The US has not yet responded to the Soviet Union’s proposal to hold a foreign ministers' conference instead of a meeting of representatives from the eleven Far Eastern Commission countries. Marshall did not indicate when the meeting would be held, but it is widely believed that the originally scheduled date of August 19th has been postponed.

[Central News Agency, New York, July 6th] – The New York Herald Tribune argued in an editorial for an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, but stated that if the treaty prevents the completion of America's plans for Japan, then it would be better not to conclude one. The newspaper stated that the absence of a treaty has severely hindered efforts by MacArthur to revive Japanese industry and establish a solid economic foundation for the Japanese government. It said that the prospect of certain industrial sectors in Japan being used as reparations caused anxiety, making it nearly impossible to restart many factories. These factories, it said, could be given to China or the Philippines as reparations within one or two years. The newspaper further stated that there are many difficulties with the peace treaty, such as the Soviet Union's opposition to the US proposal to have the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission draft the treaty and decide by a two-thirds vote. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union insists on Moscow's veto power over all treaty terms, seeking to achieve its consistent goal of controlling the East and expanding its influence. Commenting on China's suggestion that the treaty's decisions require the agreement of at least three of the most directly affected countries, the newspaper said that this suggestion clearly stems from the extreme fear among Chinese people of the resurgence of a strong Japan and the recurrence of another Sino-Japanese war.

Since the 6th, the National Army has surrounded them in the narrow area of Dongkou, Yuncheng, and Daimiao.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, July 7th] – The battle in western Shandong has entered a tense climax, with the remaining Communists being squeezed by the National Army forces into the area around Liangshan Marsh, mentioned in the novel "Water Margin".

### Discussion on Impeachment of Elected Officials at the Supervisory Committee Symposium

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – The Supervisory Committee of the Control Yuan held a symposium on the morning of the 7th and focused on discussing the issue of impeaching centrally elected officials. In the past, during the period of political tutelage, the impeachment of elected officials was proposed by the Control Yuan and executed by the Central Supervisory Committee. However, the current government is a tri-party government, so it cannot be handed over to the Supervisory Committee. Furthermore, elected officials are not civil servants, so it cannot be handed over to the Central Government Officials Disciplinary Committee either. The meeting was unable to provide a concrete solution on how to handle this matter and will ask President Yu to seek instructions from the National Government. The meeting adjourned at 10 AM. Many supervisors attended the symposium on the 7th with great enthusiasm. Yu Youren was unable to attend due to a trip to Shanghai.

### National Government Commends Wang Jiarang

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th] – The National Government issued an order on the 7th: The Executive Yuan submitted a report from the Ministry of National Defense regarding Wang Jiarang, the commander of the 13th Regiment of the 13th Army of the Army, who died in action resisting the enemy. It was verified that this was in compliance with the regulations of the Martyrs of the War of Resistance and requested that the matter be referred to the Control Yuan for review and a commendation order be issued. It was found that Commander Wang Jiarang fought bravely against the enemy during the Central Plains Campaign in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), making outstanding contributions. He later died valiantly in the Linru war zone, which is deeply regrettable. He should be commended by a commendation order to recognize his loyalty and martyrdom.

### Democratic Constitutionalist Party Announces Separation from Democratic Socialist Party in the United States

[Central News Agency, New York, July 6th] – The San Francisco headquarters of the Chinese Democratic Constitutionalist Party in the United States announced today that the party has completely separated from the Democratic Socialist Party. The reason given was that the internal divisions within the Democratic Socialist Party have made it impossible for the Democratic Constitutionalist Party to continue the merger. The party also announced that they have resumed their status as a fully independent political party and will establish their headquarters in Shanghai. The Democratic Constitutionalist Party sent a telegram to Zhang Junmai, denouncing the disputes between the centralist and reformist factions within the Democratic Socialist Party, stating that the divisions within the Democratic Socialist Party have rendered the merger with the Democratic Constitutionalist Party meaningless. The original intention of the merger between the two parties was to promote cooperation between the two parties in seeking national liberation. The Democratic Constitutionalist Party has a large number of members both in China and in the United States. The party's predecessor was the Constitutional Monarchist Party. The party merged with the Democratic Socialist Party in 1945 when Zhang Junmai came to San Francisco to attend the United Nations Conference.

### Wan Yaohuang Goes to Guling for Talks; Hubei Province is Peaceful; Efforts Will Be Made to Restore and Rebuild in the Future

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – Wan Yaohuang, Chairman of Hubei Province, left Nanjing by plane for Xunyang on the morning of the 7th. After a brief stop in Guling, he will return to his post. Before his departure, Wan spoke to our reporter about the recent situation in Hubei, stating that there are no Communist bandits left in Hubei, and all counties are peaceful, providing a good environment for post-war restoration and reconstruction. The province suffered greatly during the war, especially in western and northwestern Hubei, which were severely devastated. In some county towns, only one-tenth of the buildings remained intact at the time of victory, and most county and city buildings were more than half destroyed. The Hanyi Highway, a vital transportation route, was heavily damaged by the Japanese in order to maintain their supply lines. Within five or six miles along the line, all residents were killed and all villages were razed. In the past and for some time to come, the main task of the provincial government is how to engage in restoration and reconstruction, turning the ruins back into paradise. He came to Nanjing this time to attend the grain conference and the administrative and conscription symposiums. There were no difficulties in the execution of Hubei Province's conscription and grain tax payments. The administrative symposium allowed the central government to deepen its understanding of local politics, which is of great benefit to the future improvement of the system and the coordination of work. Wan expressed his gratitude to the Han City press for their good guidance of politics, and regretted that he was unable to host the Beijing-Shanghai press corps in the province. When discussing the equestrian statue of Chairman Chiang in front of Zhongshan Park in Han City, he praised the sculptor Liu Kaiqu for his exquisite skills.

[Our Dispatch, Guling, July 7th] – Wan Yaohuang arrived in Guling at 4 PM on the 7th after flying from Beijing to Xunyang. He is scheduled to fly to Hanyang in three days. Wan made a special trip to Guling to inquire about his son's illness after completing his official duties in Beijing. Our reporter, who arrived here on the same plane as Wan, interviewed Wan about his gains from going to Beijing and his thoughts on the central government's measures. Wan said: "We feel that China's politics today has already stepped towards democracy, and we are very willing to follow the central government's intentions to implement it, so that the central and local government orders can be coordinated."

### Representatives of Industrial Groups in Shanghai State Their Opinions on Trade with Japan, Petitioning the Government in Nanjing, Hoping the Government Will Take the Initiative

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – The Shanghai Industrial Association, the National Machinery Industry Federation, and other groups sent representatives Hu Boxiang, Mao Shengdong, and 13 others to Nanjing to petition the government regarding the opening of trade with Japan. After arriving in Nanjing on the morning of the 7th, Hu and others went to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other agencies to petition. Director Chen Fang, Secretary-General Gan, Secretary-General Lou, Minister Chen, Minister Gu, and others received them. The representatives stated their opinions on opening trade with Japan, explaining that China's industry and commerce were affected by the dumping of Japanese goods before the war and could not develop. They suffered significant losses during the War of Resistance and have not yet recovered. Therefore, they had previously requested the government to postpone opening trade with Japan. Now that the government has partially opened trade with Japan due to national policy and international situation, the industrial and commercial sectors have put forward the following opinions, hoping to be adopted: (1) Since the government has decided to open trade with Japan, it should adopt public opinion, consult thoroughly, and determine the specific plan for this partial opening of trade with Japan as soon as possible, so as to take the initiative and benefit the country. Anything that can be manufactured domestically should not be allowed to be imported from Japan. At the same time, raw materials should not be supplied to Japan to manufacture goods and then sell them to China, creating an industrial Japan and an agricultural China. (2) The representatives of business must determine their powers, vow to serve the group, and eradicate the attempt to seek personal gain. State-owned and private, without distinction, business and industry, work together, the organization can be sound, officials and the people can avoid isolation. (3) In order to prevent smuggling and fraud, the organization of anti-smuggling agencies should be strengthened, with the full assistance of industrial and commercial groups and the joint reporting of the people of the whole country. State-run progress is extremely rapid, and it may not be impossible to compete with Japanese goods. The government should adopt more protective policies for the Nanyang market. Director Chen and others said that they would be able to adopt the opinions of the industrial and commercial sectors and explained that the restrictions on opening trade with Japan this time were extremely strict, and imports from Japan would not be as easy as imagined. At the same time, the government would also strictly prevent smuggling. The representatives were very satisfied with what they heard. Also, the Capital Chamber of Commerce hopes that two or three places can be allocated to Beijing for sending representatives to Japan.

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – The Shanghai Industrial Association and all Shanghai industrial trade associations petitioned in Nanjing for the issue of quota allocation for raw material imports. Tian Heqing, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Industrial Association, also reported on this to the press.

In general, both the Philippine and Chinese business communities have little enthusiasm for reopening trade with the former enemy Japan.

Acheson Refuses to Provide Information on Japanese Trade

[Associated Press, Tokyo, July 7th] – The US representative, Acheson, chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, today refused to provide the Soviet representative with information on Japan's foreign trade and production outlook, on the grounds that the detailed and extensive information required by the Soviet Union could not be compiled and published in a special form. This is the first time that a formal application to the committee from the four-nation delegation has been rejected by the United States. The Soviet side, represented by Kislenko, asked Trefyanko what kind of goods and how many would be exported by Japan this year through private trade and government exchange. What are the Japanese government doing to increase the production of raw materials and export goods, what are the reasons hindering the development of production, and how do they plan to increase production. Acheson replied: MacArthur's headquarters publishes monthly occupation reports, and the Supreme Commander also publishes in detail the various developments in Japan and the occupying forces. The various groups under the headquarters also regularly issue reports on the progress of their specific work.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th] – At the request of the Soviet delegation, the 38th Control Japan Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 7th to discuss the issue of Japanese exports. First, Chairman Acheson expressed his opposition, saying: "The Soviet side has requested the provision of information on Japanese trade issues, but the committee is not an agency for collecting information." General Shang Zhen, head of the Chinese delegation, also argued: "MacArthur has not expressed any opinion on the Control Japan Committee before deciding to open Japanese private trade without authorization, and we cannot but be concerned about this. Therefore, the committee should put forward information on trade issues." The meeting adjourned without a conclusion.

### Method for Compiling the Number of Votes for Female Legislative Candidates

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th] – The National Assembly Delegates and Legislative Yuan Members Election Headquarters has recently provided the following explanation regarding the method for compiling and verifying the number of votes obtained by female legislative candidates: Article 14, Paragraph 2, of the Enforcement Rules of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law stipulates that the registration of female candidates should be made to the provincial and municipal election authorities. The provincial and municipal election authorities should immediately notify the election authorities in each district to announce the names of all female candidates in the province on the election ballots in each district for voters to choose. In addition, Article 5, Paragraph 3, of the same law stipulates that the number of votes obtained by female legislative candidates should be calculated separately. Therefore, in the province where the female voting district is located, each district should send the number of votes cast for each female candidate to the province for compilation. In provinces that are not divided into districts, each county or city or equivalent area should send the number of votes cast for each candidate to the province for compilation. Municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan should compile the votes directly through the municipal election office. All should follow the above regulations and calculate the number of votes obtained by female candidates separately, without mixing them with the votes of other candidates.

### Election Headquarters Sends Letters to Provinces and Cities, Setting a Deadline for the Establishment of Election Offices

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – The general election is about to begin, but not many provincial and municipal election offices have been established. Those in charge of the election say that this may be due to transportation issues, as the official seals issued have not yet arrived. The Election Headquarters has sent letters urging them to be established by a deadline. As for the expenses of the election offices in various localities, they will be temporarily covered by the provincial treasuries. The Election Headquarters has requested the central government to allocate funds for transfer. Regarding the question of how to remedy the fact that county election offices cannot handle the election affairs of legislators in the future, he said: The election of legislators is indeed organized by the district election offices, but the chairman of the district office is concurrently held by the commissioner. Therefore, to suit the facts, the responsibility can be assigned to each county in the administrative system to prepare a list of voters. In fact, each county magistrate will also be appointed by the district office to participate in the work in a nominal capacity and assist in the vote counting and supervision to complete the election of legislators.

[Our Dispatch, Hangzhou, July 7th] – Chairman Shen returned to Hangzhou last night.

### Hong Kong and Our Government Conduct Economic Negotiations and Cooperate to Stop Smuggling in South China

[United Press Hong Kong, 7th] A Hong Kong government spokesman announced tonight that the Hong Kong and Chinese governments are now in negotiations to establish a financial agreement to aid China's economic recovery. It is also heard that Lord Keynes, a former advisor to the Bank of England and current advisor to the Central Bank of China, and Thomas, the financial advisor to the British Embassy in China, are also meeting here to discuss issues related to the two countries.

[United Press Hong Kong, 7th] A Hong Kong government spokesman said that the Hong Kong government has handled 500 smuggling cases since the spring of this year.

[Associated Press Hong Kong, 7th] Senior Hong Kong government officials are now carefully studying the issue of smuggling in Hong Kong in order to cooperate with the Chinese authorities. Colonial Secretary McDougall told the Associated Press that the remarks made by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao in Nanjing in June are now receiving close attention from Hong Kong, and it is expected that the Hong Kong government will issue an announcement soon. Vice Minister Ye said at a press conference in Nanjing that the Chinese government wanted to obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government to prohibit smuggling activities in South China, but has not yet been successful. However, we should remember that another senior Hong Kong government official (Superintendent of Imports and Exports) Hemsworth told the Hong Kong court on the 5th that the Hong Kong government very much hopes that this port will not be used as a base for smuggling to harm China's economy. The statement was made at the time of the court's opening trial regarding the 15 tons of goods of unknown origin found on the Xinjiang vessel. It is believed that the Hong Kong government's response to Vice Minister Ye's statement will point out that smuggling incidents are caused by Chinese people and are tacitly approved by Chinese officials, army, and navy personnel. The British newspapers here also pointed out in editorials that the blame should be borne by China itself.

### Wedemeyer Arrives in Qingdao from Shenyang; Citizens Submit Over a Hundred Letters of Opinion; Special Envoy to Fly to Jinan Today and Return to Nanjing in the Afternoon

[Our Newspaper Qingdao, 7th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party flew from Shenyang to Qingdao at 11:30 this morning, landing at Cangqou Airport. Mr. Wedemeyer, dressed in a blue-grey suit, took several photos with the welcomers after disembarking, and the Chinese Air Force band played the Chinese and American national anthems. Mr. Wedemeyer then traveled with Admiral Cooke and Consul Spock to the city to General Cooke's headquarters for lunch. In the afternoon, at 1:30 PM, Special Envoy Wedemeyer's party, accompanied by Cooke, went to inspect the Naval Academy, where a fire drill and artillery shooting exercise were taking place. The skills were pure and skilled, which Wedemeyer greatly praised. At approximately 3 PM, they returned to the consulate and held a meeting with Consul General Spock and all staff members, lasting over an hour, during which they discussed the situation in Shandong. Subsequently, they began receiving representatives of American businesses and church representatives, followed by Speaker of the Municipal Council Li Daifen, China Bank Manager Kong Shi, Zhongshan University Professor Meng Yunqiao, etc., for a total of half an hour, during which each person provided Special Envoy Wedemeyer with various written materials. At 8 PM, the Wedemeyer delegation attended a banquet hosted by Consul General Spock. Also, this morning, those who went to the airport to welcome the group included Mayor Li Xianliang, Chairman Ge, Commander Ding Zhipan, and representatives from various sectors, news reporters, and dozens of others.

[Another Dispatch] On the eve of Special Envoy Wedemeyer's arrival in Qingdao, citizens of Qingdao sent over a hundred Chinese and English letters of opinion to the U.S. Consul General in Qingdao in their private capacities, to be left for Special Envoy Wedemeyer.

[One Report from Jinan, 7th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party are scheduled to fly from Qingdao to Jinan at 9:00 AM on the 8th and fly to Nanjing at 3:00 PM that afternoon. All sectors in Shandong are preparing a grand welcome and providing various important materials.

Special Envoy Wedemeyer Confers with Chief of Staff Chen Before Leaving Shenyang

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 7th] Wedemeyer left Shenyang at 8:50 AM on the 7th to fly to Qingdao. Wedemeyer expressed his gratitude to old friends such as Liao Yaoxiang and bid farewell to Mayor Jin and other well-wishers. The special plane took off amidst the music. The delegation stayed in Pan-tian for a total of 39 hours and 20 minutes.

[United Press Shenyang, 7th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer held talks with Chief of Staff Chen Cheng overnight. Chen arrived in Shenyang yesterday afternoon and held closed-door talks with Wedemeyer from 8:00 PM last night to 2:00 AM this morning. According to unconfirmed reports, Chen Cheng will replace Xiong Shihui as the director of the Northeast Headquarters, commanding various armies to cope with the sixth offensive that the Chinese Communists are expected to launch within a few weeks. It is a coincidence that Chen suddenly flew to Shenyang from Nanjing at this time. According to the same report, Xiong will succeed Li Zongren as the director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, and the post of Chief of Staff will be held by He Yingqin, who is currently in the United States. However, the latter statement is purely speculation. After Chen met with Wedemeyer at the hotel, he held a meeting with Xiong Shihui and Acting Commander of the Security Forces Zheng Dongguo early this morning. Wedemeyer then departed for Qingdao in a four-engine transport plane, and the only military officer who saw him off at the airport was Liao Yaoxiang, the commander of the New Sixth Army. Wedemeyer spent the whole day investigating here and obtained a large number of documents proving that the Soviet Union had provided material assistance to the Chinese Communists.

It is also learned that in the reports received by Special Envoy Wedemeyer from various sectors, it was learned that the Communist army's fifth offensive had destroyed 1,100 meters of roads, and 190 meters of the railway between Shenyang and Changchun were destroyed. Forty meters had been repaired within one month after the Communist army's retreat.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 7th] Colonel Hutchin, the director-general of the Wedemeyer mission, told reporters on the 7th that the Wedemeyer mission will return to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 8th. During this week, he remained in Nanjing to sort out the letters received, maintain contact with various parties, and received an average of at least 50 letters or more per day in seven days. These letters were either general greetings or statements of facts and suggestions. He has processed them separately and will submit them for reference after Wedemeyer returns to Nanjing.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 7th] When the issue of opening up property tax was brought up for discussion at the tenth meeting of the National Economic Commission on the afternoon of the 7th, the members spoke enthusiastically and raised many questions.

During the meeting, opinions were exchanged for over an hour on how to make the imposition of property tax effective and practical. Finally, it was decided that the Political Consultative Conference and the Legislative Yuan had both made suggestions on this matter. In order to gather wisdom and benefit from everyone's ideas, it was decided that in the shortest possible time, Secretary-General Shao of the Political Consultative Conference, Vice President Wu of the Legislative Yuan, and Vice President Wang of the Executive Yuan would invite councillors, legislators, and the speakers of the Shanghai and Nanjing Municipal Councils to hold an enlarged symposium to discuss the matter together, and the National Economic Commission would first formulate the main points for discussion. The meeting will be held in the short term, and after a resolution is reached, measures will be drafted and implemented after the legislative process is completed. Another important proposal discussed at the meeting was the factual procedure for the economic reform plan. This procedure was completed on the 6th and 7th, and is divided into matters to be implemented immediately, matters to be prepared for implementation, and matters that have already been implemented and need to be strengthened. In addition, there are also provisions for points that require new laws or amendments to existing laws. When this proposal was discussed at the meeting today, it was decided to use the criteria in the plan for operating industries to divide them into several groups. Industry, agriculture, and finance will each form separate groups for separate study. In addition to the participation of members and relevant departments, experts from outside the meeting will be invited. After the groups have studied the matter, they will submit it to the National Economic Commission and then to the Executive Yuan or the Duty Meeting. If legislation is required, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. Today's meeting was presided over by Zhang, and after the meeting began, the head of the Engineering Commission, Shen Yi, reported on the work of the past year, involving lines, highways, the design of Yellow River governance, and the design of the capital's construction. The members asked questions one after another, and Shen provided key answers.

### Water Levels Continue to Rise in Various Rivers in Northern Jiangsu; Several Sections of the Canal Embankment in Suqian Breach; Government Allocates One Billion and 10,000 Boxes of Canned Goods for Disaster Relief

[Our Newspaper Xinpu, 7th] The government allocated 1 billion yuan and 10,000 boxes of canned goods to relieve disaster victims in the flood-stricken areas of northern Jiangsu.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 7th] The water level of the Central Canal in northern Jiangsu has continued to rise sharply in recent days. Several sections of the embankment in Suqian have breached, and the water level of the Inner Canal is stable. According to the Construction Department, the Central Canal is rising rapidly due to the Yi and the Si rivers. The water level in Suqian reached 30 meters on the 3rd, which is 23 centimeters higher than in 1921. The dike between Sujiafang and Lijian in the canal has breached, and the Huangdun Lake area west of the dike is flooded, with a water level 1.8 meters higher than that of the canal. The Canal Engineering Bureau has urgently telegraphed the lower reaches of the river to drain water and remove obstacles in the rivers in Pei and other places to facilitate discharge into the sea. The Xiang Canal (i.e., between Huaiyin and Yangzhou) is rising more slowly due to the stable water level of the Huai River. The water is rising sharply, and the embankment near Zhuang has been washed away by the river water and is mostly damaged. The situation is under investigation. If the river water continues to rise or it rains, there will be breaches. The county government is now working hard to repair it.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 7th] The Ministry of Water Resources received a telegram from Su Zhuren Wang Maogong on the 6th at 6:00 PM on the 7th, stating that the Yishui, Si, Huai, and Yellow Rivers were all rising sharply, the situation was dire, and the flooded area was expanding daily to approximately 10 million mu or more, affecting 1 million and several hundred thousand people. Please send funds urgently. This situation has not occurred in the past ten years or so. Minister of Water Resources Xue has sent Engineer Ma Liang of the Jinghe Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau. Sui Su Yao went to Xuzhou and then to the disaster area to inspect.

[Our Newspaper News] According to travelers from Xuzhou to Shanghai, Xuzhou has been sunny for several days, and the weather is as cool as early autumn. The water levels of the old Yellow River and the rivers in the suburbs of the city that run through the city have been gradually decreasing. However, after six weeks of continuous rain, the disaster in the counties under Xuzhou has been formed, and the severity of the disaster is unprecedented in 70 years. Two-thirds of the autumn crops have been submerged in the water. Among them, the disaster areas in Pi County, Su County, Tongshan County, and Que Mountain County are the most vast, and they have almost become a swamp. The disaster victims are exposed to the wind and dew and are waiting to be fed. In addition, due to the recent surge in water levels in various rivers, the river water has flooded, causing many highway bridges and roadbeds on the Xu (Xuzhou) Hai (Jiuzhou) Lin (Yi) Xin (Anzhen) and Xu (Xuzhou) Jin (Xiang) highways to be washed away. The highest authorities here have strictly ordered the relevant county governments to send laborers to repair them day and night.

After Chairman Shen strongly requested in Nanjing to reduce the purchase by a quarter, the province and counties could retain more than 1.33 million dan out of the original 2.55 million dan collected in Zhejiang.

Editorial

### Professor Fei Fei's Illusion!

Professor Fei Fei, a famous American professor, recently published an article in the July issue of Harper's magazine after returning to the United States from a trip to China last year. Entitled "It Is Time to Withdraw from China," the article pointed out that the United States has only three ways to prevent the Soviet Union from invading China: (1) China should reform its politics and establish a government supported by the people, and implement social reforms to prevent extremists from inciting revolution; (2) Given that the first path takes a long time, the United States must station troops on the Chinese border to prevent the Soviet Union from invading China; (3) The United States should withdraw its labor force from China, maintain true neutrality, and declare to the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union must not take advantage of the situation after the United States withdraws from China. Professor Fei Fei also said that the first path is the safest, the second path is impractical and will not be supported by the US media, and the third path is feasible unless a third world war is inevitable.

Professor Fei Fei was invited by the Chinese Ministry of Education to come to China to give lectures for up to six months. Based on his research on Far East issues and the actual situation in China, he should not be so ignorant. However, after reading Professor Fei Fei's work, we cannot help but express great surprise. Professor Fei Fei traveled in China for six months and gave speeches to Chinese intellectuals in various parts of China. Some of our readers have personally heard his speeches. But it is strange that Professor Fei Fei observed the actual political situation in China through tinted glasses. Intentionally or unintentionally, he wanted to make a side defense for the Chinese Communist Party, saying that they were land reformists, not violent revolutionaries, and even in some places, he not only scratched the surface but also called a deer a horse. When Americans on the other side of the Pacific see Professor Fei Fei's report, they will believe it to be true. But from the perspective of our Chinese readers, we really don't know what Professor Fei Fei saw in China. Professor Fei Fei's words can be considered as the same reports from American left-wing reporters. We might have nothing to say if Professor Fei Fei had published this kind of remark without coming to China for on-the-spot investigation. But Professor Fei Fei came to China for investigation for six months, but he also echoed others' views, which makes us have to doubt his title of "Far East Expert".

Professor Fei Fei's lack of clear understanding of the actual political operation of China, and his distortion of facts everywhere, we will not discuss for the time being, and let discerning people distinguish for themselves. Even in terms of the three ways for the United States to prevent the Soviet Union from invading China, Professor Fei Fei is indeed seemingly right. First, Professor Fei Fei hopes that China can reform its politics and implement social reforms to prevent the expansion of the Communist Party's power. He stands in the position of a friend of China and gives advice to China, and we should accept it humbly. It can also be said that no one in China's ruling and opposition parties is completely satisfied with the current reality, and no one does not want to find a way to improve it. There are already symbols of reform in politics, economy, and society. As long as the CCP does not obstruct it by force, the success of this reform will inevitably be faster. However, although we believe that China's politics and society need thorough reform, we do not believe that China's political reform can prevent the Soviet Union's invasion. To be honest, the reason why the Soviet Union is trying to invade China is not in China, but in the Soviet Union's own development and its plan to dominate the world. Unless China joins the Soviet Union's embrace, the Soviet Union will not stop its support for the CCP.

Second, Professor Fei Fei believes that the United States can only prevent the Soviet Union from invading China by stationing troops on the Chinese border. He himself also knows that this method is not approved by the US media. Knowing this, he still wants to put it forward. On the one hand, it is tantamount to insulting China's national character. On the other hand, it seems to be intentionally arousing the American people's feelings of oppression towards China. Some time ago, President Chiang Kai-shek told some American reporters that he hoped that they would not abuse their power to issue remarks that hurt the friendship between China and the United States. We also hope that Professor Fei Fei will do the same.

Third, Professor Fei Fei advocates that the United States withdraw from China, maintain neutrality, and declare to the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union must not take advantage of the situation. Whether the United States withdraws from China or maintains pure neutrality is a matter for the United States, and the US authorities can decide freely. No one can force the United States. But after the United States withdraws from China, if the United States wants to use a declaration or statement to prevent the Soviet Union from taking advantage of the situation, I wonder how many "gentlemen" can abide by these "gentlemen's agreements?" What's more, under the current US-Soviet relations, whether in Europe or the Far East, the United States and the Soviet Union stand in opposing positions due to different interests and cannot reach an agreement. Does Professor Fei Fei intend to layout for the Soviet Union in the Far East by putting forward this kind of proposal at this time? We have no intention of forcing the United States to join in the Far East, but we can assert that if the US government really adopts Professor Fei Fei's wishful thinking, then the United States will inevitably make an irreparable mistake in the Far East in the future! For the sake of permanent peace in the Far East, and also for the sake of the interests of the United States in the Far East, we must have a serious defense against Professor Fei Fei's illusion, so that the people of China and the United States will not be shaken by him!

### The Third Father's Day

Today is the third Father's Day.

When the Second World War was coming to an end, celebrities from all walks of life in Shanghai initiated the August 8th Father's Day in order to comfort the fathers of the fallen. According to the plan at the time, they not only hoped that the whole country would unanimously promote Father's Day, but also hoped that it could be promoted to the whole world and become an international holiday. When the second Father's Day was approaching last year, they believed that this move was a pure expression of national integrity during the War of Resistance and was very necessary to promote. In addition to jointly submitting a request to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to be forwarded to the central government for approval and to be circulated throughout the country, they also jointly sent letters to the ambassadors of the four allied countries, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, in China, informing the people of the allied countries to promote it together.

Father's Day has only had a short history of two years since its inception, and it has not yet been formally approved by the central government in China. Although people in countries around the world have the same heart for the virtue of repaying kindness and respecting relatives, countries have not unanimously stipulated August 8 as Father's Day. Therefore, the advocacy of Father's Day is still a long way from the initial ideals of the initiators. It is precisely because of this that we have a greater need to actively promote and practice it. The act of repaying kindness and respecting relatives is not only an inherent virtue of our nation, but also what Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek want to promote at a time when the world is changing and customs are fading. Chiang Kai-shek said in his "Repaying the Country and Thinking of Relatives": "Only our ancestors emphasized filial piety first in saving the country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen replied: We have our own way of establishing a country in China. We cannot simply imitate the superficial aspects of foreign countries, let alone copy the ways of imperialists. Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace are the inherent spirit and morality of our country, and filial piety is especially emphasized in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. It can be seen that the way to establish a country in China has always been based on filial piety. The greatest filial piety is to respect relatives, followed by not humiliating them. The so-called respecting relatives means to carry forward the legacy of our ancestor, the Yellow Emperor. The so-called not humiliating means not causing our parents to be in danger." The most obvious difference between humans and animals is that they know where they come from and do not forget the kindness of their parents. "A gentleman devotes himself to the fundamentals. Once the fundamentals are established, the way will be born." There is no one in the world who can forget their roots and talk about making friends, loving the country, or the world being one family. We can almost say that all morality begins with filial piety. From this, it can be seen that Father's Day has a profound meaning and is really worth promoting widely.

The United States initiated Mother's Day at the end of World War I. Due to the active promotion of people of insight from various countries, it has long become an international holiday. The meaning of Father's Day is no less than that of Mother's Day. Mr. Stuart Leighton, the US Ambassador to China, also expressed his support for China's promotion of Father's Day. He said: "Benevolence and filial piety are virtues of the world. I deeply admire your country's initiation of Father's Day, repaying kindness and respecting relatives, and eliminating the scourge of war. I will definitely convey this to the people of my country and promote it together." Therefore, it is very possible for Father's Day to be promoted to countries around the world and become an international holiday in the future, and the Chinese people, who obey filial piety, should have the spirit of not shirking their responsibilities. We should work towards this goal and carry forward the virtues of benevolence and filial piety in China, spread them to the whole world, and realize the great ideal of our sages, respecting the elderly as we respect our own elderly, and caring for the young as we care for our own young.

### UNRRA Materials Originally Scheduled to be Shipped to North China Frozen at 88,000 Tons; Workers on Yellow River Levee Restoration Have All Withdrawn

[Our City News] UNRRA announced: Since the UNRRA Washington headquarters announced on July 28 that relief materials to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude in China and to areas controlled by the CCP would be suspended, UNRRA has notified all materials stored in various ports that were prepared for shipment to remain in their original locations temporarily. The relief materials that have been frozen include 50,000 tons planned to be shipped to CCP-controlled areas and 38,000 tons to North China. They have all been suspended since the ban was issued. UNRRA attaches great importance to the restoration work on the Yellow River dikes. However, recently, due to the lack of security for the lives of UNRRA staff in the area, they have all withdrawn. However, in Hubei, UNRRA still has 65 staff members stationed in place.

### China's Autumn Grain Harvest This Year May Increase by 100 Million Piculs; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Releases Estimated Figures

### U.S. Military Advisory Group Hosts Journalists, Reports on American Soldier Murder Case, Public Trial Possible Next Weekend with Death Penalty

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] The U.S. Military Advisory Group held a press conference at 3:00 PM on the 7th in the group's conference room. Colonel Hess Ting, Chief of Staff of the group, Colonel Gope Te, Director of the Office, and Lieutenant Colonel Mikel, Head of the Military Law Group, attended and reported in detail on the handling of the tragic case of the American soldier dumping [the body] outside Guanghua Gate, and the military judicial review process. They stated: After American soldiers commit crimes, they are under the jurisdiction of military law and are tried according to the provisions of military criminal law. A certain crime is reported to the commanding officer, who, based on the severity of the circumstances, organizes a military court of varying scales to file a public prosecution and conduct the trial. The accused can freely choose a civilian lawyer or a military public defender to defend them. After the case of Chinese people being harmed outside Guanghua Gate occurred, the facts of the crime were immediately reported to General Luke, the commander of the military advisory group, and the criminals were detained. After seven days of investigation, the evidence of the crime has been fully collected, and preparations for the trial have been completed. Military court personnel, including Colonel Gradeko and thirteen others, have been appointed as judges, clerks, prosecutors, and a defense team (headed by Major Weiss). A public trial will be held at the Lichi Society next weekend. Journalists are allowed to observe the proceedings and are now entrusted to the Executive Yuan Information Bureau for arrangements. The criminals Adorey and Fan Ni were charged a few days ago with jointly murdering two Chinese citizens. The penalty for their crime is life imprisonment or the death penalty. However, the military court may, based on evidence discovered sufficient to determine that the criminals' crimes are lighter, change the charges. Then "murder" will be replaced by "manslaughter." What is the maximum penalty for "manslaughter"? Unintentional homicide carries a three-year prison sentence, while intentional homicide carries a ten-year prison sentence. According to military law, a person who is sentenced to more than six months in prison is dishonorably discharged from the military. However, the authorities responsible for reviewing the case can order a reduction in the sentence. Colonel Hess Ting hopes that the media will introduce the characteristics of the U.S. military's speedy trial procedures and stated that they will invite some people as private individuals and do not intend to invite our officials to send personnel. According to sources in our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our side will submit evidence and suggestions based on the investigation at any time.

[Reuters London, 7th] The Conservative Party does not believe that the measures announced by Prime Minister Attlee can extricate Britain from its economic crisis, so it may vote against the government's measures when it concludes the debate today. The Conservative Party believes that the measures announced by the government are not sufficient to represent the national unity effort necessary to cope with the crisis, and their content is scattered, making it difficult to achieve results. However, government officials believe that the bill presented this time has enabled the government to take a broad stance sufficient to cope with any needs of the national economy.

### Key Points of the British Prime Minister's Speech: Elucidating the Government's Economic Policy

[United Press International, London, 6th] British Prime Minister Attlee delivered today to the House of Commons the most important speech since Britain entered the war in 1939, urging the nation to wage a "New Britain War" against the threat of economic collapse. He stated that the current New Britain War cannot be won by a few people alone but requires the sincere cooperation of all parties to achieve victory.

Churchill's speech on Monday, which stated that the Labor government wasted American loans, was an "unfortunate remark," but it is not necessary to reply. What needs to be stated is that such unfortunate remarks will cause a reaction and harm the country. The claim of wasting American loans is not credible. With loans from the United States and Canada, Britain and the world can buy time to recover, which is beneficial not only to us but also to the world. We originally hoped that this loan would last until 1949 or even 1950, when our country's economy would have a chance to improve and become balanced. However, the current fact is that this loan will be used up before the end of this year, due to the trade deficit, which has led to the depletion of U.S. dollars. Attlee then listed the country's economic policies as follows:

(1) Immediately reduce foreign purchases, by at least 12 million pounds. (2) Only purchase essential foodstuffs from abroad. (3) Increase the unit value of non-essential food rations. (4) If ration quantities need to be reduced, Britain will implement a rationing plan that prioritizes heavy industry workers. (5) Restrict the supply of food and drink in bars and hotels. (6) Reduce the value of luxury goods imports to 5 million pounds. (7) Reduce timber imports, limiting their value to 10 million pounds. (8) Purchase cotton on a long-term basis. (9) Reduce overseas travel allowances from October 1st, reducing the original 75 pounds for twelve months to 37 pounds for fourteen months, and children's allowances to 20 pounds. (10) The allowances for merchants traveling abroad will be strictly limited. (11) Gasoline allowances, which originally allowed for 300 miles of driving per month, will now be reduced by one-third. (12) Gasoline allowances for commercial vehicles will be reduced by 10%, all starting from October 1st. (13) Limit the remittances of foreign film merchants, and the amount of remittances shall not exceed 25% of the profits from their films. (14) By December, 133,000 troops stationed overseas should be withdrawn, and a total of 200,000 troops must be withdrawn by next March. The reduction in military personnel should not affect foreign policy or defense policy. (15) By the end of next March, the British army will be reduced to one million men (according to previous decisions, it is planned to reduce it to 1,087,000 men), so that 420,000 men and women can engage in 15 months of industrial production work starting in March. (16) To promote production, efforts will be made to extend working hours.

British Troops Stationed Abroad Will Be Gradually Withdrawn

[Reuters, London, 6th] Prime Minister Attlee announced today that after 200,000 troops stationed abroad are scheduled to be recalled by the end of next March, it is believed that those on the withdrawal list will not be limited to British troops stationed in India, Greece, and Italy. In addition to the aforementioned three locations, British troops stationed abroad are also distributed in Germany, Palestine, and other parts of the Middle East. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied that British troops stationed in Germany will be withdrawn soon, and judging from the current situation in Palestine, British troops will not be withdrawn for the time being in order to maintain security. Observers believe that if Attlee's planned program is implemented as scheduled, it must be because he is confident that the Palestinian issue can be resolved peacefully within the United Nations framework this autumn, and the situation in Germany will no longer require the presence of a large number of British troops.

### Gunshots in the New Chen Police Station Office: Police Officer Commits Suicide After Being Humiliated. Pan Lianbi, Implicated by His Wife's Crime, Resented It and Shot Himself to Death. The Family Claims That the Police Station Handled the Matter Improperly and Will File a Lawsuit.

[Reported by this newspaper] A suicide case occurred in the office of the first section of the New Chen Police Station at 4:20 a.m. yesterday. The deceased was Pan Lianbi (see photo), the chief of the third section of the Penglai Police Station in Nanshi, 54 years old, from Tianjin, who had served in the police force for more than 20 years. The cause of his death is very tortuous, and police officers deeply mourn his death. During the enemy and puppet period, Pan had contacted Wu Shaoshu and served in underground work. Therefore, after the victory, Wu gave him a small four-inch pistol as a souvenir. It is believed that Pan used this gun to commit suicide yesterday morning.

Pan's suicide was due to the fact that he wanted to smoke opium and was secretly reported, which led to his anger and this action. Pan was employed at the Penglai Police Station in Nanshi, and his residence was at No. 10, Lane 21, Chengdu Road, so it was under the jurisdiction of the New Chen Police Station. The initial course of events was that the New Chen Police Station received an anonymous letter, secretly reporting that Pan Lianbi and his wife were involved in drug use. The first section chief, Lu Tonghua, dispatched four police officers to search the residence at 9:45 p.m. the night before. At that time, Pan was already asleep, and his wife, Wang, was smoking opium in the pavilion because she had a stomach ailment. The police officers of the New Chen Police Station, with the evidence in hand, insisted on taking the two to the police station. Pan argued that his wife, Wang, was the one who was smoking opium and requested that only his wife be taken to the station for questioning, but the police refused to allow him to stay behind. The police officers did not grant his request, and the situation lasted for an hour. They also ordered him to put his fingerprints on the record and insisted on taking him to the station. At this point, Pan angrily said, "Okay, I'll go with you, but please wait a moment while I change my clothes." At this time, Pan had the idea of death and secretly hid the pistol on his body. After being taken to the New Chen Police Station, Pan and Wang were detained, and Pan Lianbi was placed in the office of the first section. At this time, Pan was alone with a lamp, and the more he thought about it, the more resentment he felt. At 4:30 a.m. yesterday, he resolutely pulled out his pistol and committed suicide, aiming at his temple with a loud bang. He fell to the ground, blood gushing out from his right temple. After the incident, the police station rushed Pan to the police hospital for treatment. He died at 5:30 p.m. yesterday without being cured. The bullet remained in his skull and was not removed. The body was transferred to the Changde Road examination site at 10:00 p.m. last night.

Family Members Express Mismanagement

Pan had served in the police force of this city for more than 20 years, and he was kind and amiable in his interactions with others. His death was quite bleak. He left behind three wives and three adopted daughters, but no sons. After the incident, reporters visited the family. According to them: (1) The police should have gone with the baojia chief when searching the residence, but the police station did not do so. (2) Pan was a public official and had no intention of escaping, so why force him to put his fingerprints on the record, which was insulting and caused him to commit suicide. (3) If it was believed that Pan had committed a crime, he should have been searched after being taken to the station. He had a pistol on his body, but they did not know, which was a mistake of the police station. (4) Wang was the one who was using drugs, and Pan Lianbi's crime was only hiding a criminal, which was a minor offense. There was no need to immediately take him to the station. Therefore, it must be considered that the police station handled the matter improperly. It is heard that Pan's family will file a lawsuit against the police station according to the law.

### The Shipping Association Appeals Again: Fight for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Seats

[Reported by this newspaper] Du Yong, chairman of the National Shipping Association, sent a second telegram yesterday to Chairman Chiang, Premier Sun, President Zhang, and Minister Gu, requesting the government to allow the shipping industry to participate in the National Assembly with three representatives and the Legislative Yuan with five members, as the implementation of the constitution is approaching. At the beginning of the association's establishment last month, representatives from local associations proposed that the shipping industry should strive for seats in the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan for professional groups to participate in politics. Representatives were sent to Beijing to petition successively, and their reasons were: (1) The shipping industry has multiple relationships with industry, commerce, and economy, which is different from purely commercial groups. (2) The shipping industry is an independent unit and is not affiliated with any commercial institution. (3) During the Anti-Japanese War, 90% of the national flagships were sacrificed. After the victory, they handled the repatriation work and contributed a lot. The shipping industry has made greater contributions to the country than any other professional group.

### The First Cholera Case Enters the Urban Area

[Reported by this newspaper] The first cholera case in this city this year was discovered on the 2nd of this month.

He felt unwell that night and did not seek medical treatment. On the morning of August 2nd, he began to vomit and diarrhea. Due to financial difficulties, he could not afford medical treatment. He went to his cousin's Shunxing Tea Garden at No. 3, Huai'an Road, and was sent to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road for medical treatment at 4:00 p.m. He is gradually recovering and is still being treated in the hospital. It seems that the patient was infected near Jiangyin.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Food Distribution Committee held its fourth committee meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday at the Lawyers Association, chaired by Chairman Wu Kaixian. The implementation measures for the distribution of edible oil to industrial workers in Shanghai, the detailed rules for the implementation of rice distribution to professional workers, and the issue of rice distribution to the poor were amended and approved. The main points are: (1) The amount of rice to be distributed to the poor in the first phase has been reviewed and completed, and 55,687 shi and 5 dou of rice should be distributed. The handling fee for rice shops is changed to 1,500 yuan per shi. (2) Public rice shops for the poor will be set up in each district. The original plan was to set up one shop for every 500 shi of rice, but now it is decided to set up one public shop for every 200 shi of rice. (3) The original plan for the distribution of rice to the poor was to distribute pure broken rice. Now, because the market price is gradually decreasing, and the difference with the price of rice distribution is not much, it is decided to improve the quality of rice distribution to three-quarters of Burmese rice and one-quarter of broken rice. The distribution price and transportation costs are still 178,000 yuan per shi. (4) Rice distribution to the poor in the first phase has already begun. If each district does not go through the application procedures, it will be considered as a waiver, and the rice to be distributed will be equally distributed for the second phase of rice distribution in other districts. (5) The price of rice distributed to professional workers is 240,000 yuan per shi, plus transportation, warehousing, and sales fees, totaling 250,000 yuan. The distribution procedures are the same as the assistance for the poor's rice sales. (6) The distribution of oil to industrial workers is two catties per month. Because the index for July has been compiled, it will be implemented from August. (7) The request of the Rice Industry Association that each rice shop should receive a legal profit of 6% for handling the distribution of rice to professional workers was rejected.

It is reported that the bandit was about 25 or 26 years old, spoke with a Hunan accent, and was of medium build. At that time, he showed a "Song Chenwei business card from the Second Section of the Economic Section of the Police Station" and asked to talk to the manager. After being led in by the clerk, he suddenly said to the manager, "I am not a public official, but a member of the underworld. Today, I have come with five brothers, and four of them are still guarding outside the door. Because I have long admired Fang Jiuxia, I have come to borrow 100 taels of gold and demand that it be handed over within five minutes, otherwise I will kill you." After the manager begged, he agreed to 30 taels. After the bandit succeeded, he rushed out of the door. When the people in the jewelry store chased out to see, the bandit's claim that there were four people outside the door was actually a bluff. However, because it was noon and the road was crowded, the bandit escaped without a trace after a slight delay. After the police station announced the incident, fearing that unscrupulous people would take the opportunity to extort money, it announced that in the future, all staff members sent out by the Economic Section will hold a formal "attendance certificate" as proof.

### Yang Anren's Reasons for Disagreeing with the Conviction: Denies Intentionally Giving Others the Opportunity to Seek Profit

[Reported by this newspaper] The two defendants in the Jin Chao case, Yang Anren, former deputy director of the National Bank Business Bureau, and Zhan Yunsheng, chairman of the Shanghai Gold Industry Association, were previously sentenced to seven years and four years of imprisonment by the District Court, respectively. Both of them filed applications with the District Court for a new trial. The reasons for Zhan's appeal were recorded in this newspaper on July 29. Yang's reasons for appeal were also sent to the District Court yesterday. His reasons for appeal stated: "The original judgment pointed out that there were errors in the National Bank's gold trading procedures, but according to the decades of practice of Chinese and foreign banks in the gold market, gold transactions are based on paying the money first and then taking the goods. As for the fact that the National Bank received more than 2.5 billion yuan in bank drafts to offset the cash when secretly selling gold on February 8, bank drafts have become a habit in various industries to replace cash, and it has also been adopted by various government agencies. Also, February 8 was the last day for the government to allocate gold to the gold industry. The National Bank collected a large number of bank drafts to offset cash, so that Tongfengyu Gold Company was not affected by the suspension of allocation on February 10. The National Bank's主管 authorities did not know that February 8 was the last day of allocation at that time. The original judgment said that it intentionally gave Zhan Yunsheng the opportunity to seek profit, but there is a lack of active evidence."

However, the parties involved in the case, including 8th Company Commander Wang Tingyun, 9th Company Commander Ren Yafu, and Platoon Leader Li Yutai, did not travel with them and are temporarily staying at the regimental headquarters awaiting interrogation.

### ### Private Demolition of Air Raid Shelters; First Trial Yesterday; Rui Baogong Lent the Money; Time After Construction Began

[Our Report] Rui Baogong, Dean of General Affairs of Fudan University, Zhang Guoxian, Principal of the National General Primary School, and foremen Che Jigui and Guo Ruimao, etc., were accused of illegally demolishing large air-raid shelters. The case was heard for the first time yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Mei Erhe. Zhang Guoxian stated: "In order to expand the National Continuing Primary School, I discussed demolishing the air-raid shelters with Fudan in November last year. Before construction began, I borrowed one million yuan from Fudan as wages. Two-thirds of the demolished bricks and tiles would belong to the school for construction purposes, and one-third would be given to the foremen as wages."

Rui Baogong stated: "The location of the air-raid shelters was the site of the former Shanghai University, which was allocated to Fudan. Zhang wanted to demolish the air-raid shelters to expand the primary school. I stood on the educational standpoint and was very sympathetic, but did not agree. As for the loan of one million yuan, I lent it to him privately. The money was lent twenty-some days after the construction started and had nothing to do with wages." Foreman Che Jigui stated: "I signed a contract with Zhang to demolish the air-raid shelters. Rui Baogong urged me several times to finish the work quickly. No one interfered during the demolition. The school took one-third of the demolished bricks and tiles, and I took one-third as wages. When I transported these bricks and tiles away, Fudan refused to issue a certificate, so the police questioned me." Guo Ruimao's statement was similar. Witness Yu Shuzhi testified that Rui did tell Zhang that he had to report to the relevant authorities. The court adjourned the hearing, stating that the case was still under investigation.

### ### Famous Northwest Drug Traffickers Busted in the Dasing Hotel; Five Criminals Arrested, 18 Ounces of Heroin Seized

At the end of last month, Chief of the Army General Staff Chen Cheng secretly telegraphed Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, stating that there was a large-scale "Northwest Gang" drug trafficking organization in this city, scattered in various hotels, ordering a swift crackdown. Commander Xuan received the telegram and ordered the Investigation Department to take charge of the case. Director Tao then instructed the First Brigade to conduct a thorough investigation. After several days of careful arrangement, it was finally discovered in the late night of the 2nd of this month that there were five people from Ningxia in the Dasing Hotel on Simalu, whose behavior was suspicious. An investigation was immediately launched, but nothing was found. Unexpectedly, just as they were at a loss, a quarantine certificate was suddenly picked up in the corridor. The name and place of origin filled in on the certificate were Ma Xingzong, 19 years old, from Ningxia, and a photo was attached, which matched the sixth name on the secret arrest list opened by Chief of Staff Chen. Without showing any signs, the appearance of the passengers was secretly checked. It was indeed similar to Wang Jinshi, who lived in Room 28. At this point, it was determined that Wang was an alias of Ma Xingde. On the morning of the 3rd, they entered Room 28 and searched, finding five criminals: Ma Xingde (alias Wang Jinshi), Ma Zhongde (alias Ma Ming or Ma Mingwu), Tian Zhiyuan (alias Tian Xingkui), Yang Shouren, etc., and seizing 18 ounces of heroin in a special compartment in a leather suitcase. The people and the goods were then escorted to the brigade headquarters for strict interrogation. According to Ma Xingde's confession: They are indeed well-known "Northwest Gang" drug traffickers. The leaders are Chen Zhaokui (alias Chen Ying), Ding Zhanlin, and Guo Shenglv, etc., totaling fifteen people. Except for the three criminals Chen, Ding, and Guo, the remaining twelve are all accomplices. The drug trafficking location is secretly purchased from Peiping and then brought to various parts of the Northwest for sale. On July 19, he was ordered by the principal offender Chen Ying to bring heroin in Peiping, along with Yang Shouren, Ma Yifang, Tian Zhiyuan, Ma Zhongde, Li Shengwang, Wang Shengsan, Ma Fang, Ding Zhanlin (the principal offender), Guo Lu (the principal offender), Ma Tianguo, etc., to Shanghai. At that time, they lived in the Zhongnan Hotel, Dasing Hotel, and Oriental Hotel. At that time, each criminal carried a large amount of drugs. The other criminals, Chen Ying, Yang Xueren, Zhang Fengxuan, Ma Yongzhi, Ma Xuedong, Wang Yihe, Yang Wengui, Hai Yuzhen, and Ma Junqing, etc., are still in Peiping in charge of receiving goods. However, Ding Zhanlin, Guo Shenglv, and others arrived in Shanghai on the 25th and left Shanghai the day after, turning to the Northwest, leaving only five of them in Shanghai, who were arrested when the case broke out. The Investigation Department has sent telegrams to security agencies in various places to assist in the arrest of the principal and subordinate offenders who have left Shanghai one after another. A group of people will be transferred to the local court for strict handling today.

### Victory at Linqu

[Our Reporter Li Tian in Jinan] Barely half a month after "unveiling the prelude to the great counteroffensive," and in the last week of this fiery July (starting from the 24th), Chen Yi, with his seven columns of 150,000 troops, launched this year's largest "counteroffensive" on the Shandong battlefield against the city of Linqu, a transportation hub. The flames of war, like this fiery July, spread fiercely.

Linqu is a small city located on the west bank of the upper reaches of the Mi River. A tributary of the river flows north of the city and meets it two miles away. A highway connects to Yishui and Linyi in the south, and to Yidu, Shouguang, and Yangjiaogou in the north. In addition to materials and soldiers from northern Shandong passing through this place to the remote mountainous areas, supplies from a certain group relocating from Lüda across the Bohai Sea were also unloaded at Yangjiaogou and transported to the mountainous areas via Linqu. Therefore, Linqu is actually the general transportation hub for the CCP in Shandong. At the beginning of July this year, the deceitful army made a foray, and then gave up immediately. However, the army occupied the city again. The original city, which had been thoroughly destroyed by the National Army when it occupied it, and whose area was less than half of that of Tai'an.

General Li Mi

After entering the city with his six regiments, in addition to clearing out the communist bandits and comforting the refugees, he first started to repair the fortifications and rebuild the city walls. But in the end, the time was short. How much could be done in 36 hours? Therefore, apart from completing some necessary field fortifications, the so-called permanent fortifications were actually out of the question. From 9:00 p.m. on the 24th, the bandit army first used five columns and a part of the local team to attack the four passes regardless of sacrifice. Among them, the attacks on the North Pass and Qushan, which is one kilometer east of the city and can overlook the entire city, were the most fierce. However, all the soldiers in the city, under the command of General Li Mi, were able to regard death as home, advancing without retreating. The city walls were therefore ensured. From dawn on the 28th, the communist bandits increased their troops by two columns, totaling seven columns including the fast column and the 2nd, 6th, 7th, 9th, 3rd, and 5th columns. Except for the 3rd column stationed at Sanchakou as the general reserve team and to block the National Army from Namma from going north, the remaining six columns joined the attack. Especially the heavy artillery of the fast column constantly bombarded the city, and most of the houses in the city were destroyed. More than a thousand bandits broke into the North Pass. Sergeant Jianzhong was forced to carry three injuries, but he still fought to kill the enemy and did not retreat. Battalion Commander Hou Xijin and Zhou Yu-kuan were also inspired by the regimental commander and did not retreat despite being wounded.

Therefore, the three armies obeyed orders and the morale was greatly boosted, and at about 4:00 pm, all the remaining bandits who broke into the city were annihilated. Upon hearing the news, the highest authorities issued a special order to distribute 300 million yuan in consolation money, ordered to be transferred by Wang Yaowu. On the night of the 28th, the communist bandits intensified their offensive, and the east and west sides of the city were broken into three times by the bandits, but all were repelled. On the morning of the 29th, the sky suddenly became overcast and it rained heavily. The communist bandits took advantage of the difficulty of activity of the national air force and launched a full-scale attack. In the fierce battle until night, except for Qushan in the east of the city and a corner in the south of the city, which were still held by the National Army, the rest fell into the hands of the communist bandits. At this time, the National Army in the city had been struggling for five days and nights. There were no supplies or ammunition inside, and no reinforcements outside. At this point, the war had reached its most critical moment. Finally, relying on General Li Mi's command, calm operations, and at the same time, the air force defied the worst climate, dividing day and night, giving bombs to the bandits and supplies to the defenders, in addition to rice and flour, and agreeing to the defenders' request, transporting a large number of bullets and cannons from Jinan, they finally survived the last departure. On the 30th, they first repelled the bandits from the east and west gates. On the 31st, they went north from Naxieyuezhuang, and from Changle and Juxian southward

Two-Way Army

First arrived at the line of Muhu Mountain and Nigu Mountain eight kilometers east of the city, and the upper and lower five wells ten kilometers west of the city, giving the attacking bandit army a counter-encirclement. The communist bandits initially struggled, but by 5:00 pm on the 31st, the National Army's encirclement was getting smaller and smaller, and the defenders in the city, with the arrival of the response troops, fought more and more bravely. They first lifted the siege of Qushan in the east of the city. The bandit armies, seeing that the general situation was over, began to break through in three directions. One route, with one and a half columns, broke through and fled to the southeast towards Liushan Village and Jiangyu. Another route, with one and a half columns, broke through and fled to the northwest towards Zhuyai. The main force, about four columns, fled north towards Yidu. One division that had originally occupied the North Gate was annihilated by the National Army because the order came too late. The bandit army division commander and more than a thousand of his troops fled back to rescue and struggled to the death before breaking through and fleeing. By the afternoon of the 1st, the National Army pursuit troops had already docked at Yidu and Liushan Village. When the National Army cleared the battlefield, they found more than 9,000 bodies of bandits left behind, and more than 5,000 wounded soldiers. Together with the officers and soldiers who died later, the number of casualties of the bandits in the past eight days was

At Least 40,000

More than people, and the stream of the Mi River was stained red by it. And the National Army casualties were only two regiments and one battalion, creating the largest victory since the Great Search in Siping Street. This victory not only eliminated some "combat power" of the bandits in Shandong and ensured the past victories of the National Army, but also stabilized Changyi. (Li Mi's troops are the elite of the National Army in the Changyi area. If Linqu is not defended and Li's troops are "eaten," Changyi will inevitably be unable to defend itself. The impact on central Shandong and even the entire Zhou is not difficult to imagine.) And it also eliminated the "fighting spirit" of the bandits in Shandong. Although Chen Yi has reorganized more than a dozen local teams in Jiaoxi into ten independent brigades again, attempting to regroup after the Qing Sha rises (the second half of August) for the last fight, the main force of the Shandong communist bandits (whether Chen Yi's or Liu Bocheng's), after the various large and small battles in the fiery July, is obviously facing the eve of the German collapse, which is an undeniable fact. And with the coming of August (unless the Shandong communists increase their troops again from the Northeast or Hebei and Shanxi), at least south of the Jiaoji Railway, the communist bandits, in addition to imitating the past in northern Jiangsu and dividing into several small groups to engage in a wandering life, cannot have any decisive impact on the Shandong situation or even the overall domestic situation. This is a well-known fact. (1st)

The refugees in the Pixian disaster area, which was the worst hit, were in a pitiful situation. Many of them died of starvation on trees and roofs after not eating for several days. A few days ago, a woman in the northern township, in order to avoid the water, climbed a willow branch. Suddenly, she went into labor and safely gave birth to a son. However, due to being scorched by the sun and rained on, and being exposed to both heat and cold, both mother and child died together. The tragic situation was so severe that those who heard it were saddened.

Wang Baozheng, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, Liu Pingjiang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Senate, Dong Shang, Chief of Finance, Lu Xiaobo, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce, and Jin Chongru, Executive Director of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, etc., received the press in Zhenjiang on the 4th to report on the disaster. Chairman Zhu expressed his grief and compassion, and repeatedly emphasized the importance of relief work in a kind and caring tone, saying that saving the people is the natural duty of revolutionaries. Secretary-General Liu Pingjiang reported that the people in the various counties of Xuzhou have suffered in recent years from the burden of military supplies, engaging in repairing dikes, digging trenches, building cities, and dredging rivers, all in the communist bandits' traitorous military actions. Faced with the current tragic natural and man-made disasters, and the righteous actions of the people of Northern Jiangsu to serve the country and support the government for the suppression of the rebellion and nation-building, the people of Northern Jiangsu have really not failed the country, and the government should not sit idly by and do nothing when they are suffering this great disaster.

### Call for Voices: Transforming into Candles of Light, Illuminating Refugee Homes

After Su Bei Refugee Association Standing Director Jin Chongru reported on the impending crisis of future Yellow River disasters and the overall disaster that Su Bei would face, he once again made a passionate appeal to the reporters present, asking them to report the flood situation in detail and recite a five-character poem: "May the hearts of reporters transform into candles of light, not illuminating silk-clad seats, but illuminating refugee homes!" After listening, the reporters responded with a round of applause.

Natural disasters have arrived, and man-made disasters have not ceased. The suppression work in the Su Bei Pacification Area urgently needs to be advanced. It is heard that the bandits in Binhai and Guo Xiahe are actively preparing to seize grain and coerce the disaster victims. Commander Li Mo'an of the First Pacification Area of Nantong and Commander Zhang Xuezhong of the Huaihai Pacification Area of Huaiyin are both planning a thorough suppression during the hot summer. According to concerned people, although the strength of the National Army in Su Bei today needs to be increased, it is undoubtedly sufficient to monitor the remaining bandits and advance to suppress them at the opportune time. The most worrying thing at present is that the self-defense forces in various counties cannot be effectively utilized. Deputy Commander of Security Mai Baoshan once publicly pointed out that the self-defense force has become a tool for urging rent and settling accounts, and a lackey of local tyrants and evil gentry. The Communist bandits even ridiculed the self-defense force as an "escort of honor for weddings and funerals," a military arsenal that does not require labor. Reporters believe that if this point is not quickly addressed and reformed, there will be little success to speak of.

### Dongtai · Xinghua: "Quick Monkeys" Plummet to 90,000 Yuan Per Load

The early rice in the lower reaches of the river has already entered the market. The "quick monkeys" harvested in Dongtai and Xinghua counties are said to be selling for only 90,000 yuan per shi, a very low price. Therefore, the villagers are once again worried about low grain prices hurting farmers. Those who are accustomed to hoarding grain for profit have already pointed their arrows at food. In the past week, grain prices in Zhenjiang have been quite chaotic, but the general expectation is that unless the early rice in Jiangnan is fully harvested and the flood does not continue to expand, the rice price can remain within the 250,000 mark. Grain prices have already been severely stimulated by the floods.

The summer clouds are not yet gone, and the heat is gradually dissipating. The price of melons has fallen to 500 yuan per catty. However, the various industries in Zhenjiang City are still in a midday sleep. The long, asphalted Daxilu Road is quiet and silent, resembling a small town in the countryside. This is because the operating expenses of businesses are increasing day by day, while the purchasing power of consumers is weakening day by day. The commercial market is as still as stagnant water, with only the political departments showing a glimmer of vitality, as conscription and grain administration have been actively launched. The government is busy surveying disasters and providing relief, and preparing for universal suffrage. As the autumn wind is about to rise, rumors of a light tax reform of the Jiangsu provincial government have spread in Beijing, but according to well-informed sources, this move seems to be still pending.

### China Trust Bureau Convenes Meeting to Discuss Oil Production Methods

Seeking Increased Edible Oil Production to Support National Mobilization Plan

[Our Newspaper Report] The Central Trust Bureau convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM to discuss ways to increase edible oil production. Attendees included representatives from the Central Bank (Pan Jiufen, Shen Zhurui), the Agricultural Bank of China (Wang Botian), the China Plant Oil Factory, and the Plant Oil Refining Industry Association of the Third District (over ten representatives in total), presided over by Wang Yinpu, the chief of the Bureau's Audit Department.

The main focus of yesterday's discussion was how to coordinate with the National Mobilization Order, entrusting relevant production agencies to secure a large quantity of essential daily necessities to ensure sufficient supply for consumption, while also changing the past reliance on loan-based methods to increase production. The China Plant Oil Factory was instructed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to increase edible oil production by 20,000 dan, and the Four Banks Joint Office approved a commissioned production arrangement with China Plant Oil to increase production. Subsequently, the Central Bank's President Zhang requested an expansion of the production plan, specifically increasing the target from the planned 20,000 dan to 30,000 dan. The Bureau carefully discussed the novel method of commissioned oil production, and the results were satisfactory. The implementation details will be finalized soon.

### Mayor Concerned About Edible Oil Supply

Mayor Wu Guozhen has expressed great concern regarding the supply of edible oil in the city. He met with Zhang Decheng and other representatives from the China Plant Oil Factory at the mayor's office in the municipal government yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM to inquire about the situation. Zhang and others provided detailed reports on the supply and price of edible oil, and also reported that the factory had previously lent 7,000 dan of edible oil to the Civil Food Allocation Committee for the purpose of widely distributing oil, which led to a temporary suspension of regular distribution starting on July 12th. Subsequently, fearing fluctuations in the market price of edible oil, the factory also sold 2,567 dan of rapeseed oil to the market continuously from the 1st to the 6th of this month to stabilize prices. Now that the Civil Food Allocation Committee has decided to only distribute oil to industrial workers, the borrowed 7,000 dan can be returned. Therefore, the China Plant Oil Factory will soon be able to resume the distribution of edible oil through 600 retail oil stores.

Finally, Zhang and others analyzed the reasons for the rising oil prices, stating that the fluctuations were largely due to rampant smuggling in South China. Raw oil from Qingdao costs 800,000 yuan per load, and after adding 50,000 yuan for shipping to Shanghai, it costs 850,000 yuan. However, prices in South China are even higher, making smuggling very profitable. Another reason is that although the new soybeans are available, the quantity is small, and inventories are low, leading to an imbalance between supply and demand. Private oil factories are now buying rapeseed and switching to rapeseed oil production. Therefore, while the supply of raw oil is insufficient, the supply of rapeseed oil is expected to be adequate in the future.

### Arbitrage Interest Rates Plummet, Shanghai Stocks Remain Stagnant

Shanghai stocks remained stagnant yesterday as major off-exchange investors turned bullish, interest rates opened low at 1.2 and 1.65 fen, and money was loose and cheap, making arbitrage very inexpensive. Buying gradually recovered. Although there were unfavorable developments along the way, the opening and closing situations were extremely stable. Popular stocks like Yongsahong showed signs of rebound, while miscellaneous stocks were less optimistic. The overall trend remained stagnant.

The market opened high in the morning due to the large difference in exchange rates between forward and national banks, and news that the Tianjin Stock Exchange would also open soon, boosting investor confidence. Yongsahong opened at 135 yuan, and after the opening, numbers 133, 186, 235, 89, 160, and 12 all advanced, while numbers 14 and 2115 advanced in ready Yongsahong, and the market climbed to 231 yuan. Numbers 97 and 235 sold ready Yongsahong, and numbers 224 and 223 also closed out positions at high prices, forcing the price down to around the morning opening price.

After 10:00 AM, with the addition of positions by numbers 207, 12, and 157, numbers 225 and 230 also acquired current delivery Yongsahong, gradually stabilizing the market. However, the next most popular stocks did not benefit, and Huafeng Enamel suffered even more under the heavy selling pressure from number 220 and the Industrial Bank. Extending to after 10:30 AM, it was heard that a banking group was aggressively buying off-exchange, and numbers 231, 116, and 207 absorbed positions on-exchange. Numbers 95, 116, and 130 then advanced in ready Yongsahong again, and the forward-date Yongsahong briefly rose to 234 yuan. Numbers 2113 advanced and then exited, and numbers 218, 235, 103, and 155 also supplied shares for sale, while numbers 147, 235, and 97 continued to sell ready Yongsahong, forcing the price back down to 227 yuan. Meiya fell back below the 400 yuan mark again, ultimately remaining mostly flat, with limited price increases. Numbers 116 and 125 absorbed positions again, and numbers 32 and 130 also acquired current Yongsahong. By closing time, the popular stocks were in a slightly better position. Yongsahong closed at 227 yuan and 231 yuan.

After the close, asking prices were lower, with forward Yongsahong retreating to around 230 yuan. Compared to the previous closing prices of ready delivery stocks, Huafeng suffered a slight decline, Xinhua fell by 0.5%, while Yonggong, Xinhe, Meiya, Xinguang, Yongsahong, and Zhongfa rose slightly, Jingfu and Qinxing remained flat, Xinya fell by slightly less than 10%, and Guohuo Cement, Datong, and Lian remained flat, Zhongfang, Tongyi, Zhongsheng, and Rongfeng rose slightly, and underwear, Jinglun, and matches fell slightly. Among the forward delivery stocks, Huafeng was flat, Meiya rose slightly, and Yongsahong, Xinguang, Yonggong, and Jingfu all rose by slightly less than 0.5%. The other old stocks remained relatively stable.

In the ready forward arbitrage market, banking groups were still mostly buying at a premium yesterday, with limited trading and interest rates ranging from just over 6 fen to around 1.1 jiao. Among them, the Yongsahong premium retreated from 6.5 yuan to close at 5.2 yuan. Meiya's high was 12 yuan, the low was 10.5 yuan, and it closed at 11 yuan. Xinguang rose from 3 yuan to 4.5 yuan, closing at 4 yuan. Huafeng fell from 2.5 yuan to close at 2 yuan.

### Government Bonds Rebound, Foreign Stocks Mediocre

Government bonds also rebounded yesterday, with trading volume increasing to around 7 million yuan. Unified C Agricultural opened at 10,900 yuan. After number 360 sold, it covered positions, and although numbers 552 and 230 sold, numbers 550 and 503 both added positions, causing the price to rise sharply, stabilizing slightly after reaching 11,900 yuan. A and B also rose from 7,400 yuan to close at 8,000 yuan, an increase of 700 yuan for A, B, and E compared to the previous close, Unified C rebounded by 1,000 yuan, and Unified D also rose by 600 yuan.

Foreign stocks were mediocre yesterday. Ewo Silk fluctuated by no more than 2,000 yuan. Guangdong investors bought Ewo Silk, while foreign firms sold. Securities firms bought British American Tobacco, which was sold by banking groups. Wool was also supplied by banks. Ewo Silk opened at 86,500 yuan, fell to 84,500 yuan, and then rebounded to close at 86,000 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Wheelock Marden and Indo-China Steam Navigation rose slightly, China Paper and Ewo Brewery remained flat, Ewo Silk, British American Tobacco, Yieh Hsing, and China Steel lost slightly, while Shanghai Telephone fell by less than 0.5%.

### Sluggish Rice Market, Japonica and Indica Continue to Decline

Yesterday, a total of about 6,300 shih of rice arrived in the north and south markets, but the market remained sluggish, and the trend continued to decline. Japonica rice and early thin rice both fell by over 10,000 yuan. The influx of new Japonica rice led to a sharp decline of over 10,000 yuan, with medium-grade and lower-grade rice falling into the 40,000 yuan range. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice both fell sharply by 100,000-200,000 yuan. Indica rice lacked buyers, and rural merchants were absent, leading to a further decline of 100,000-200,000 yuan.

The sluggish trend of flour resulted in a slight decline of 1,000 yuan. Bran sales were clear and sluggish, falling by another 300-500 yuan. Summer cakes rural sales had become sporadic. The season for new autumn crops was approaching, and fertilizer sales were coming to an end. There were occasional inquiries from other areas in Taiwan, but transactions were limited, and the market was mediocre. Soybean arrivals were sold in exchange, and the situation was stable. Mung beans remained sluggish, gradually becoming slightly cheaper. New mung beans from Sichuan, Zou, and eastern Zhejiang arrived in Shanghai, but the future outlook remained unfavorable. Red beans were firm. Yuan wheat was sold as soon as it arrived, and there was little impact. Corn from North China became active again, rising by another 10,000 yuan. Deliveries of red sorghum were weak, and prices fell by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Sesame remained weak, and deliveries from various regions continued, indicating a downward trend. Shelled peanuts from South China continued to be processed, advancing by 10,000 yuan. Broad beans saw slight movement from out-of-town merchants and local streets but remained stable. The price of English beans remained unchanged. Flour mills were buying wheat at 148,000 yuan, and the standard for medium-grade wheat was still based on moisture and ash content.

In the oil market, interest from Guangdong merchants waned, and local streets also lacked significant buying interest, with only sporadic small transactions. All oils declined by 100,000-200,000 yuan.

### Reasons for the Closure of Hong Kong Zhenghe Bank

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 7th] Following the sudden announcement on the 6th that Zhenghe Bank was suspending operations, those involved in the banking industry expressed shock. The bank opened last year, with its main business focused on serving overseas Chinese. According to sources, the reasons for the bank's closure are as follows: (1) Two months ago, the bank sold a large amount of national currency at low prices, and this currency was mostly remittances from overseas Chinese in other regions. Recently, the currency rose, and the bank's received remittances were due for payment. (2) A long-distance trading company affiliated with the bank recently suffered excessive losses. (3) After the closure of the Shantou branch of the long-distance trading company, depositors rushed to withdraw their funds. (4) The bank's opening costs reached 300,000 Hong Kong dollars, accounting for 20% of the paid-up capital (1 million Hong Kong dollars). (5) The bank adopted a standalone development strategy, with no connections to other banks, leaving it isolated and without support. Creditors have already held meetings to discuss how to recover their losses.

### Textile Adjustment Group Meeting Held Yesterday, Reducing Negotiated Prices for Fine Count Yarn, Lower Than Last Price by 200,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper Report] The Textile Adjustment Negotiated Pricing Group held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Many committee members attended, with Rong Erren serving as the acting chairman. After discussion, the original negotiated prices were deemed too high due to the recent weakness in yarn prices. After renegotiation, the price of 10-count yarn was set at 6.82 million yuan, and the price of 16-count yarn was set at 8.62 million yuan. The above negotiated prices remained unchanged. 20-count yarn was priced at 9.6 million yuan, 32-count yarn at 12.8 million yuan, and 40-count yarn at 14.4 million yuan, all 200,000 yuan lower than the previous negotiated prices.

[Another Report] According to informed sources, the fact that market prices for fine count yarn have been lower than the negotiated prices recently is due to the Textile Construction Company's extensive sales. The majority of the output for yarns of 20 counts and below comes from private factories. Recently, sales have been sluggish, causing market prices for coarse count yarns to be higher than negotiated prices. Therefore, it is hoped that private factories will also comply with the agreed-upon sales, so as to jointly cooperate to suppress yarn prices.

### Coarse Yarn Shows Slight Rebound

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was still mediocre at the opening. Later, Guangdong merchants slightly reduced their inventory, and local dyeing factories and weavers absorbed yarn of 20 counts and below. By the end, the market rebounded. As a result, 42-count double-ply Lanfeng fine yarn continued to fall by 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 16.65 million yuan. Baoguang Shuiyue and 40-count Jixiang Baoguang, 32-count double-ply Fengnian, and other fine yarns all decreased by 30,000-100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse rebounded by 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 12.2 million yuan. Zhuanbian Shuyin also rose by 150,000 yuan, to 1.045 million yuan. Zong Jincheng Red Thread, Tian Funu Double Happiness, and 16-count Guangming Sanming Tian Funu Hailong, 10-count Thread Ziche Jinbao Star, and 6-count Dasheng and other grain yarns all rebounded, ranging from 100,000 yuan to over 100,000 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Still Lacks Improvement

The cotton cloth market remained sluggish and lifeless yesterday. Out-of-town merchants still lacked purchasing interest, and local merchants only made small replenishments. By the close of the market, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth had fallen to 419,000 yuan, down 4,000 yuan from the previous day. Wufu, Lanji, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and other grades also decreased by 2,000-3,000 yuan to 6,000-7,000 yuan. The markets for other unbleached cloth, coarse cloth, and Biji cloth were also lackluster. Shilin cloth, Taohuawu, and Baimao printed cloth saw slight reductions in factory prices.

In addition: The China Textile Construction Company continued to sell cloth yesterday, selling a total of 2,200 bolts, with 73 applications. Two local manufacturers purchased 240 bolts. 71 cloth shops purchased 1,960 bolts. The listed item was still one type of Five Cotton B-branded fine cloth, with the price reduced to 362,000 yuan, and Jumping Carp Biji cloth at 420,000 yuan. It is also heard that the company will be transporting a large batch of cloth to South China for sale within this month.

### August Civilian Coal Allocation Totaling 5,000 Tons

[Our Newspaper Report] The total amount of civilian coal to be supplied by the Fuel Management Committee in August is still set at 5,000 tons. The allocation price may be adjusted appropriately based on actual costs.

### Social Affairs Bureau Plans to Request National Bank to Restore Original Fuel Oil Quota, Reduced to 2 Million USD in Third Quarter

[Our Newspaper Report] In April and May of this year, a fuel oil panic occurred in the city, with unscrupulous merchants hoarding and speculating, leaving citizens with nowhere to buy fuel. Furthermore, due to illegal merchants mixing gasoline into the fuel oil, fires broke out repeatedly. Although the problem was very serious at the time, the actual supply and demand were relatively balanced. After the Social Affairs Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Fire Department jointly took appropriate measures, the situation was quickly resolved. However, the consumption of fuel oil was lower during the second quarter due to the summer season. In the third quarter, as autumn and winter approached, the demand for fuel oil gradually increased. The Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the Temporary Import Management Committee requesting an increase in foreign exchange allocation.

Now that reports indicate that the fuel oil quota for the third quarter has been reduced to 2 million USD, a 30% decrease from the 3.3 million USD in the second quarter, fuel oil panic is bound to reappear. The actual supply is insufficient, making it difficult to stabilize the market. Furthermore, artificial fuel oil is of poor quality and extracted from diesel fuel, which will lead to diesel re-entering the black market, benefiting unscrupulous merchants.

In light of this, the Social Affairs Bureau plans to request the Central Bank to approve the restoration of the original fuel oil quota in order to stabilize the market. According to relevant sources, restoring the original import quota should not be a problem, and the city's fuel oil supply should not be at risk.

### Silk Weaving Industry Holds Subcommittee Meeting Opposing Increased Price of Artificial Silk, Awaiting Approval from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs

The silk weaving industry has been opposing the China Trust Bureau's increased allocation price of rayon. After sending representatives to petition the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau, the issue has garnered attention from various parties. According to sources from the association, silk weaving industries in Hangzhou and Suzhou have also sent representatives to Shanghai to hold a subcommittee meeting with local representatives yesterday afternoon to review countermeasures. They decided to continue striving for a reduction in the allocation price. Otherwise, over 400 silk factories in the city, as well as their counterparts in Suzhou and Hangzhou, are prepared to halt production in protest. They are currently awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant agencies. Sources have also revealed that the authorities are carefully considering a thorough approach to the allocation of rayon and may adopt measures similar to the control of cotton yarn, whereby the authorities entrust silk factories to weave silk fabrics using rayon, and then sell the finished fabrics entirely through the China Trust Bureau, in order to prevent merchants from hoarding and speculating.

Rayon Market Fluctuates, Factory Management Stable

Yesterday, the rayon market fluctuated. Number 120 Kosan Yukomyo opened at 24.8 million yuan in the morning and closed at 24.5 million yuan on the selling side, representing a decline. The price then rebounded in the afternoon, with a final transaction price of 24.9 million yuan, resulting in a decrease of 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

The factory management market remained stable yesterday, with very few transactions. C-grade was offered at 29.2 million yuan, and D-grade was offered at 8.8 million yuan. The asking price for dry silk was the same as yesterday. Silk goods rose after the market opened due to large purchases and short covering.

### China Trust Bureau Disposes Enemy Assets Worth Over 900 Billion Yuan

[Our Newspaper Report] According to information from the China Trust Bureau, the value of enemy and puppet assets disposed of by the bureau totaled over 900 billion yuan by the end of July this year.

Exports were almost entirely special products, with timber exports accounting for 17.2 billion yuan, tea for 3.1 billion yuan, and paper for 2.7 billion yuan, indicating an improvement in the price of timber.

### Taiwan Sugar Market Weakens Again

Yesterday, the Taiwan sugar market weakened again. The reporter noted that all of the transactions were for medium white sugar, and due to the lack of strong buying interest, the market did not fare well. The association's list prices were 550,000 yuan for medium white sugar and 555,000 yuan for Taiwan red sugar, both down slightly by over 10,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half white coarse-packaged sugar was priced at 680,000 yuan, and oil-extracted green sugar was priced at 420,000-30,000 yuan, with very few transactions. Xinghua white sugar was priced at 570,000-80,000 yuan, and Xinghua red sugar at 420,000 yuan, with a total of 200-300 baskets traded. 50 baskets of Hainan red sugar were priced at 425,000 yuan, and 50 bundles of Diaoqing sugar at 340,000 yuan.

### Dim Tea Market

Various teas for domestic sales have seen a decline in activity since the connection and acquisition by local merchants and out-of-town traders. The demand appears to be temporarily satisfied, resulting in a relatively sluggish market. However, sentiment remains positive, leading to a stable but stagnant situation. As for foreign tea houses, there has been no improvement in transactions. The trend remains calm and unfavorable due to the firm stance of the goods owners.

### Anglo-American Cigarettes Rise in Price

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with firm sentiment. Anglo-American cigarettes saw brisk trading, and the market atmosphere was lively. Due to strong demand, "Ten Great Britain" brand cigarettes rose to 9.76 million yuan, a rebound of 230,000 yuan from the previous day. "Old Knife" brand cigarettes also rose by 120,000 yuan to 7.55 million yuan. "Five Flowers Ha" cigarettes also saw a rise of several tens of thousands in customs price.

Among Chinese-branded cigarettes, "Brandy," "Crest," "Red Gold," and "Red Man" brands saw relatively strong sales, with prices rising by 200-300 to 500-600 yuan per carton. "Beautiful Gold," "Gu Quan Lu," and "Change Axe" brands remained stable. "Camel," "Lucky Strike," and "Morely's" cigarettes saw little change. "Listening Head" cigarettes such as "Cavendish," "Three-Five," and "Water Doctrine" brands rebounded by 500 to 1,000 yuan due to scarcity.

### Active Spot Cotton Market

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was active. Due to the previous day's purchase offer from the Textile Construction Company, many in the trade sold cotton due to long-standing trading relationships. However, the offered prices were not high. Lingbao cotton reached a maximum price of 2.15 million. Customers felt that the Textile Construction Company's offer was lower than private factories, and sentiment was weak, so they dared not raise prices. Those with urgent cash needs also sold off their cotton. Traders actively covered their positions, and both buying and selling were brisk in the market. Various firms traded Lingbao cotton at 2.12 million, 2.13 million, 2.14 million, 2.15 million, and 2.175 million. Han fine cotton traded at 1.95 million, 2.02 million, and 2.03 million. Shashi cotton traded at 2.065 million, Laohekou cotton at 2 million, and Shandong Toray Silk at 2.1 million. Pudong fire engine cotton traded at 1.725 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton traded at 315,000 per load.

Another news item: The China Merchants Bureau's Cai E ship sailed to Qingjin yesterday, loaded with a large batch of foreign cotton, including 500 bales for Qingdao and more than 6,400 bales for Tianjin. A slight pullback is expected. This cotton is being transported by the China Textile Corporation.

### Timber Market Conditions

### Reader Consultation

Legal Clarification

Dismantling Doors and Windows, Moving Furniture: Two Households Show Off Their Power, People Suffer Amidst Roof Noises

Dear Editor: My father rented a house at a certain location in August of the 27th year of the Republic of China. There was no lease agreement at the time. Later, the landlord, Sun, sold the house and moved with it to a house on Nanchang Road, living in a large room with three machines and one large item. The monthly rent was paid monthly and never in arrears. Later, at the landlord's request, they moved to a smaller room. My father tolerated this due to his circumstances. Now that my father has gone to Japan for work, Sun's family is using the excuse of taking back the house for their own use, forcing them to move into a small, cramped room, taking advantage of them and making threatening remarks. Now I have several questions and would like you to answer them: (1) Is it illegal for Mr. Sun to take back the house for his own use under the pretext of self-occupation? (2) Is it illegal for Mr. Sun to dismantle doors and windows and move furniture without permission? How should we deal with this? (3) If we take this matter to court, can we win?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan Answers] (1) Taking back for personal use requires providing concrete evidence. (2) Before legally terminating the lease, if the landlord dismantles the doors and windows of the rented house or moves the tenant's belongings without authorization, and if there is violence, coercion, or obstruction of the exercise of rights, a report can be made to the police station for the crime of obstructing freedom. (3) The court should base its judgment on the facts, evidence, and the law.

### The Father

— By Bjornstjerne Bjornson, Translated by Cao Guoping

People all said that this man was quite wealthy and influential in the parish; his name was Sandor, Oflaas. One day he was in the pastor's study, a tall and enthusiastic man.

He said, "I have a son, and I want to have him baptized."

"What do you want to call him?"

"Finn—after my father."

"Who are the godfathers and godmothers?"

"They are all relatives of Sandor, all unanimously recognized and proven to be the best men and women in the parish."

"Is there anything else?" the pastor asked, looking around. The farmer (Sandor) hesitated a bit, and finally opened his mouth:

"I would very much like to let him perform the baptism himself."

"Then on the day of the week, right?"

"Next Saturday at twelve noon sharp."

"Is there anything else?" the pastor asked again.

"Nothing else." The farmer twisted the hat in his hand as if he were about to leave. The pastor stood up.

"Alright!" the pastor said, walking towards Sandor; he shook his hand and looked at him with a serious look and said:

"God has given you this child, he is your only happiness."

Sixteen years later, Sandor revisited the pastor's study.

"Really, your years have passed very happily, Sandor!" the pastor said with surprise and joy, because he had not changed his old appearance at all.

"This is because I have no worries." Sandor replied.

The pastor was silent, and after a moment he asked, "Why are you so happy again tonight?"

"The reason I have come is for my son, who will be formally confirmed tomorrow."

"He is a clever child."

"Before I hear the number of the seat he deserves in the church tomorrow, I don't want him to be allowed into the church."

"He will get the first place." the pastor said.

"I heard. Here are ten dollars for you." Sandor said.

"Is there anything else I can do for you?" the pastor stared at Sandor and said.

"Nothing else."

Sandor went out.

Eight years passed like flowing water. One day there was a commotion outside the pastor's office. Many people wanted to go in, and Sandor was the first to enter.

The pastor greeted them and paid his respects to Sandor.

"Have you come to attend this evening party? Sandor."

"I have come here to ask you to have the letter announcing the wedding period printed for my son, he is going to marry Karen, Storiten. She is the daughter of Jude Meng, who is standing next to me now."

"Oh, she is the richest girl in this parish."

"They say so…" the farmer replied, stroking the hair on the back of his head with one hand.

The pastor stood quietly for a while, as if deep in thought. Soon, without any comment, he recorded the names of the two people in the book, and signed his own name below.

Sandor put three dollars on the table.

"I only need one dollar." the pastor said.

"I understand this, but he is my only son, and I want to do things generously."

The pastor took it.

"Sandor, this is the third time you have come here for your son's affairs."

"But now I have settled his lifelong problem for him." Sandor folded his pocketbook and said goodbye to the pastor.

Those people followed Sandor slowly out.

Two weeks later, the father and son were boating on the lake. It was a quiet and peaceful day. They were going to Storiten's house to discuss and plan the wedding.

"This transverse thwart is not very stable," the son said, and stood up to level the plank.

Soon, the thwart he was sitting on vibrated and slid under him. He stretched out his hand to grab something, shouted, and fell out of the boat.

"Hold tight, son!" the father shouted frantically, jumped closer to him, and threw out the oar.

His son tried three times unsuccessfully, making him gradually panic.

"Wait a moment," the father shouted, struggling to rock the boat closer to his son.

Then the son struggled hard on the surface of the water, finally looked at his father and sank.

Sandor could hardly believe that his son had drowned; he held the boat pole, staring at the spot where his son had sunk, as if his son would float to the surface again. Some bubbles rose to the surface of the water, gradually increasing, and finally one large one burst; the lake waves returned to smooth tranquility like a mirror.

For three days and three nights, people saw the father circling the scene of the accident, shaking, forgetting to eat and sleep; he was scooping the lake water in order to get his son's body. On the third morning, he found it, held it in his arms, and carried it to the mountain of his own home.

One year after this incident, one late autumn evening, the pastor heard several people looking carefully for something in the corridor outside the door. The pastor opened the door, and a tall and thin man, with a hunched body and pale hair, walked in. The pastor had to carefully look at his face for a long time before he could recognize him.

It was Sandor!

"Why are you still walking so late?" the pastor said in front of him.

"Yes, it is, it is earned." Li said, taking a pair of pants. The pastor also sat down, as if waiting for something, silent for a long time.

Finally, Sandor said;

"I have some things with me that I would like to give to the poor. This is a share of my son's inheritance, and I hope it can be invested to generate interest."

He stood up, put the money on the table, and then sat down again.

"This is a large sum of money." he said.

"This is the price of half of my land, which I have already sold today."

The pastor sat quietly for a long time, and finally he asked;

"Sandor, what do you intend to do now?"

"Something better."

They looked at each other for a moment, Sandor's lowered eyes were pinned by the pastor's gaze. Immediately the pastor said gently:

"I thought your son finally brought you true happiness."

"Yes, I thought so too." Sandor said, looking around, two large teardrops slowly flowed down his cheeks.

Author's Biography—Bjornstjerne Bjornson (1832-1910) was a poet, novelist, playwright, orator, and political commentator. He engaged in literary work in the early 20th century, and he had innate intelligence. Considered along with Ibsen as the two greatest Norwegian writers. This "Father" is the most brilliant short masterpiece, worthy of showing the author's talent. Although the text is short, the meaning is extremely rich, and it can be called profound. (Translated from Bjornstjerme Bjemson Complete Works “The Father”)

### Feelings on Father's Day

— Zhang Yiqu

In the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Yu and other colleagues, Yuan Xilian, Chen Qingshi, Mei Lanfang, Shi Zhifu, Lu Ganchen, Yan Duhe, Fei Mu, and Fu Wenshou Luo Junzi, jointly initiated the August 8th Father's Day, hoping to repay virtue and respect parents, and eliminate the scourge of war. Unexpectedly, after the initial pacification of foreign troubles, internal strife arose again, human relations were lost, and material desires ran rampant. Looking at the difficult times, poetry cannot fully express my meaning.

Eight operas wash away enemies in the Milky Way, but family strife cannot wash away new tear stains,
Swords and silk are distant dreams, beasts in clothing are vaguely neighbors;
Thousands of miles of homesickness bring constant sorrow, a hundred years of nation-building begins with kinship,
When autumn comes, tell the osmanthus trees to sing together for the evergreen Father on this festive occasion.

### Dad

— Lianzi

Today is Father's Day, and it is also the day of the Autumn Solstice. I imagine that this afternoon, at the moment of the Autumn Solstice, Dad will surely be happily distributing watermelons to his daughters, and I believe that at this time he will definitely think of his daughter who is missing him here. The eight years of wartime exile have made us suffer enough. In order to fulfill Dad's three desires of guarding the festival, my eldest sister and I used the weak strength of two girls to support this family with difficulty. Not to mention eating melon to relieve the heat, we didn't even have food to eat when we were at our poorest, but I never forgot to buy a watermelon for Dad on the Autumn Solstice, even if it was just a small one. I know Dad would not forget our family's tradition for generations—the whole family eats a little watermelon on the Autumn Solstice! I can't bear to watch Dad feel uncomfortable on this only festival of the year, for not having a slice of watermelon to share with his children.

I remember one day, Dad came back from the outside, the sorrow on his face was even heavier. He tried his best to avoid my inquiring gaze, but finally, with a trembling voice, he quietly said to me: "Child! There are rumors outside that your second brother has been killed in battle. I dare not publicize this news, for fear of making your grandmother and mother anxious, because in our poor family, we can no longer..." I was stunned by this shocking news, but when I saw Dad's worried face, I endured my tears and comforted him: "Dad! I don't think we can easily believe the rumors, I'm afraid someone is deliberately spreading rumors." Dad grasped my hands tightly and nodded with a half-believing look, but from then on, the anxiety hidden in Dad's chest made his body even thinner and weaker.

The war dragged on day by day, and our suffering deepened. June 12th—this is also a day forever engraved in my heart—there was not a grain of rice in the house, and not a penny in our pockets. "What are we going to use to cook?" Mother said anxiously. I searched east and west, and suddenly found half a tube of yeast for making noodles. I exclaimed with joy, I said. "Mom! Let's use it to make cakes to eat!" Mom, the eldest sister, and the younger brother all knew that this was not good food, but other than that, what better food did we have? I just thought that grandmother was old, how could she swallow this rough food? Dad had been sick in bed for two days, how could he eat this sour and hard cake? Suddenly, I thought of the two pieces of candy that a colleague had given me in my pocket, which I had originally prepared to bring back to Dad, who was sick, so I crushed the two pieces of candy, wrapped them in two cakes, and baked them softly. I gave them to Grandma and Dad. Grandma couldn't bear to eat them alone, so she gave half of them to her little brother, who was looking at the hot cake. I don't know if Dad was hungry, or if he hadn't tasted sweetness for a long time? After eating, he said he wanted to eat another one. But how could I make another sweet cake? Little brother didn't know whether it was to please Dad, or whether he thought the cakes were all sweet? He secretly took a cake to Dad. Dad took a bite of the sour and hard cake, and he understood. When we and Mom were discussing how to make another sweet cake, Dad came, and he saw the two candy wrappers on the table, and understood everything even more. He said with tears in his eyes, "Poverty can take away all my enjoyment, but it can't take away my children's filial piety to me; what sumptuous feast in the world can be more delicious than this sweet cake?" Dad's joyful and poignant words moved us and brought tears to my eyes. I wanted to avoid my face so he wouldn't see the tears hanging on it, but in a moment of panic, my hand that was pressing the cake didn't press on the cake but pressed on the hot pot and burned out blisters. Dad lovingly pulled my hand over and carefully bandaged it with some medicine. Bathed in Dad's kindness and love, a smile appeared on my tearful face, and everyone was amused by my appearance of being both sad and happy. We ended this simplest and most sumptuous lunch in this mood of alternating crying and laughing.

The news of the victory came so suddenly that we were so surprised that we were suffocating. Dad did not forget his second brother in his joy, and a faint shadow of worry still lightly covered his cheerful face.

That day, as we were discussing how to return to our broken home (because relatives in the countryside wrote that our house had not been completely burned down), a green-clad man stuffed a letter in through the crack in the door. I quickly ran to pick it up. When I saw the name of the sender on this travel-worn envelope, I couldn't help but jump up and down, "Ah! Dad! This is a letter from my second brother!" Tears of joy blurred my vision. Dad tore open the letter with trembling hands and read it with all his strength, as if he were a sacred pastor, reading the solemn Bible. The old grandmother in the corner of the house also listened restlessly, laughing and crying with joy! On the last piece of letter paper, there was also a money order attached, which solved our problem of returning home.

We hired a boat, moved our simple and broken luggage, said goodbye to the house where we had depended on each other for seven years, and returned to our hometown with a light heart. The small trees we planted eight years ago had grown lush and pleasant, and they swayed in the wind as if welcoming the return of the masters who had been separated for eight years. Dad stood among the weeds beside the flower bed, supporting a chrysanthemum that he had loved deeply before and that was still living old now, looking at Dad's white hair scattered in the west wind, I thought of my former strong father, and the eight years of chaotic life. Not only had it added to his decline, but it had also deepened the old age of his soul! Just like this frost-resistant chrysanthemum, buried in the weeds!

This year's lunar New Year's Day is Dad's sixtieth birthday. We all brought gifts and went home to celebrate his birthday. Because of the suffering of living under someone else's roof, we arrived home in the evening of the Lunar New Year's Eve in a torrential rain. Grandmother tried to make a fire so that Mother could quickly make some snacks for us to fill our stomachs and drive away the cold. Mother was cutting the meat vigorously, and Dad suddenly remembered something and went to the room to get a lot of candy to distribute to us. When I saw the wrapper of this bag of candy clearly, I admired Dad's memory as much as mine, because I had not forgotten this candy for making cakes for Dad, and there were still many hidden in the box, ready to be given to Dad as a gift. My fourth brother also noticed, we threw ourselves into Dad's arms, shedding tears of joy under his caress, until Mom called us to eat snacks, then we left Dad lovingly.

When Dad was young, he poured all his energy into his ten children, but today, when all ten children have grown up, has he ever enjoyed a little bit of his children's happiness? Thinking of this, I couldn't help but feel ashamed again.

### Father's Day Song

— Zhong Ruzhou

Sing to the Father!

Children!

Who gave us the vitality of life?

Who used strong arms to support us,

Leading us to pursue the true meaning of life?

Salute the Father!

Children!

The Father's love,

Is hidden in deeper and more distant care,

He let his own sweat and blood drip by drip,

Brew into the sweet nectar of life,

Nourishing every piece of land where we grow;

So that our lives,

Are as bright as the sun,

More gorgeous than the rosy clouds.

Pay tribute to the Father!

Children!

He will use the steel knife of the spirit,

To carve the life of history

With fresh blood;

Use tireless labor,

To weave the glory of the motherland;

When we grow up,

We will inherit

This great achievement.

Cheer for the Father!

Children!

Today,

Let us raise the golden cup of history,

To celebrate my Father's divine torch

That will never be extinguished.

### Shanghai's Abscess

— Shi Lang

Anyone who has seen "Sunrise" knows that there is a "Golden Man" who never appears on stage, but issues orders from behind the scenes, ruling his own "kingdom."

There are many such people in Shanghai, but they are not as exclusively unscrupulous as you might imagine. Because these people have some knowledge of literature and music, why can't they also feign elegance?

Like Ximen Qing, a familiar figure, he is skilled in both martial and literary arts. He can associate with those in power and collude with local bullies.

Therefore, the "gangster" sued by more than two hundred businesses along Avenue Edward VII is seen as quite normal and peaceful by Shanghainese.

It seems that as long as Shanghai exists, these "movie stars" should also exist.

This is like a person "drinking poison to quench thirst." One day, he can no longer sustain his life with medicine. On his fleshy face, there is a lack of vitality.

Such people are like "abscesses" growing on the bodies of Shanghainese. They have been around for too long, and it seems they should exist. Therefore, the lawsuit by more than two hundred shops on Avenue Edward VII gives us a sense of surprise.

Can we fundamentally remove the "abscess" on Shanghai's body through surgery? This is a terminal illness, and only with the determination of both doctor and patient can it be fundamentally cured.

### Introducing Two Female Ambassadors

— Rong Guan

Madam Pandit and Madam Kollontai

Since the provisional government of India announced the appointment of Nehru's sister, Madam Pandit, as India's first ambassador to the Soviet Union, female ambassadors representing their countries abroad have no longer allowed Madam Kollontai to be the sole pioneer!

Shen Bao reported on the 4th, citing a London broadcast: "India's first ambassador to the Soviet Union, Madam Pandit, took a flight to Fissco on the 3rd." As the telegram indicates, this first female ambassador of Asia, Madam Pandit, was born in 1899, ten years younger than her elder brother Nehru. Although she is also a "old" woman of forty-eight! She has a "weather-beaten" face, graying hair, and a medium build. She, her brother, and her husband, Mr. Pandit, have all been involved in the struggle for India's independence, and she has been arrested and imprisoned three times. Mr. Pandit's life ended due to the setbacks and hardships of the revolution, but his mother is still alive and is now over ninety years old. Her daughter, Xi Xueliya, is accompanying her to the Soviet Union this time. In the past, Madam Pandit was in charge of education in her birthplace of Allahabad, and she also served as the president of the All-India Women's Association and represented India at the United Nations General Assembly. At the United Nations Conference in San Francisco last year, although she participated as a representative of the Indian people, her appeals and activities for India's freedom and independence won the sympathy of the world. Mr. Mao Shuqing, the Shen Bao's special correspondent in the United States, praised her in his New York correspondence as the most successful speaker among the twenty-odd chief representatives. (See the Shen Bao of November 30th last year.) Her English is very clear in every syllable, although there is a bit of an Indian accent mixed in, but it is not annoying to listen to. Recently, she served as the Minister of Health of the United Provinces. Her reputation in the country is comparable to that of the late British Minister of Education, Miss Wilkinson. With such a woman with rich political work experience taking on the new position of India's first ambassador to the Soviet Union, she can undoubtedly be competent and happy. Her success is not only the happiness of the Indian people but also the glory of all East Asian women!

Speaking of Madam Kollontai, her name is even more familiar to the world: she is the world's first female diplomat and also the first female ambassador stationed abroad. She was born in 1872 in the home of a wealthy landowner in Russia. Her husband, Alexander Kollontai, was a nobleman. Although she broke away from her stubborn family at the age of eighteen and dedicated her youth and life to the women's liberation movement. She spent more than twenty years in exile. She attended university in Germany, specializing in economic issues and women's issues. In 1917, she left Germany to engage in the anti-imperialist movement, but she was soon arrested by the government and imprisoned in a dark hell. Fortunately, the October Revolution in the Soviet Union rescued her, and she began to be reused by the new government, taking on work in education and other fields. In 1921, Madam Kollontai was appointed as the ambassador and trade representative to Norway. In 1926, she was transferred to be the ambassador to Mexico. In July 1930, she was transferred to be the ambassador to Sweden, and has remained there until now. Madam Kollontai is indeed a remarkable figure. She is a versatile, knowledgeable, and capable woman: she is a diplomat, educator, expert on women's issues, and a talented writer. She has two famous works that have been introduced to China: "Red Love" and "Three Generations of Love." She believes that career should be more important than love, which may be the reason for her success. She has even more extensive writings on women's issues and is considered the theoretical authority on women's issues.

### Exhibition of Private School Achievements

— Fang Ren

The exhibition of private school achievements, sponsored by the Municipal Bureau of Education, opened on the 5th at the Jiaozhou Road Experimental Private School. The participating units reached 120, the exhibition rooms occupied eleven rooms, and the participating exhibits totaled 11,774 pieces, which can be said to be a grand spectacle.

The achievements of each unit are roughly divided into three parts: one is administrative, such as daily logs and registers; the second is instructional, such as homework and test papers; and the third is promotional, such as manuscript purchases and newspaper clippings. In addition, the Experimental Private School also handles promotional district business and has a model of land and buildings in the promotional district, which is very outstanding.

It is said that many experts have been invited to judge the achievements participating in this exhibition, so there is no need to add much. Now, after a cursory glance, the reporter will briefly express his impressions as follows:

(1) The development direction of the achievements of various private schools is very uneven. A few only use student homework and test papers to fill the space, which is inevitably a bit monotonous. In fact, student homework and test papers are very easy to collect, while administrative and promotional achievements are subject to continuous records and cannot be fabricated arbitrarily, so they are rare and valuable.

(2) The exhibited achievements should be limited to the scope of the unit's own responsibilities. If they are irrelevant, they should be omitted. For example, one or two show silk fabrics, belts, light bulbs, cigarettes, and thermos bottles produced by factories as exhibits, which is too broad and inevitably loses the original nature of the exhibition. Because private schools do not have courses such as factory work, and such industrial products cannot be made with the existing equipment of the school; therefore, they seem superfluous.

(3) Statistical charts should focus on accurately representing numbers and clearly showing proportions. The brightness of colors, the quality of paper, and the sophistication of the project are secondary. A few schools neglect the former and focus on the latter, which seems unnecessary.

In addition, regarding the layout aspects, the Experimental Private School has a unified and harmonious look because it has set aside three separate rooms; the other units are jointly displayed, and some have few achievements but occupy a large area, while others have many achievements but are cramped in a corner; also, the size, horizontal and vertical orientation, and height of the charts are all left to their own development, and the points of unity and harmony seem to have been neglected.

### Leading the Way

— Hu Lu

Pilgrims to Putuo were kidnapped, and two hundred million yuan was used to get them out of danger—see a Japanese newspaper in this city in August.

On the sacred mountain, on the sacred mountain, Buddhist teachings are boundless, pilgrims compete to seek new blessings and longevity, the water and land rituals at the temple cause trouble, and life and death are at stake.

Rich guests, rich guests, think of becoming immortals once they are rich! They don't know that the Compassionate Guanyin is stingy with her ferry, ferrying back and forth on big king boats, two hundred million turns into wasted money!

American Miscellany Xu Shuyuan The War Brides of American Soldiers

War brides are the inevitable product of "war." War brides can be called genuine or non-genuine. For example, if a soldier marries a woman during the war, she is of course a genuine war bride. If a businessman marries a woman in the rear while escaping hardship, she cannot be considered a genuine war bride because her husband never fought in the war but only escaped to avoid it. The number of American war brides can break world records. Millions of American soldiers went to Europe and the Pacific, most of them unmarried men. When they arrived in England and France, due to the harmony of customs and habits, coupled with the loneliness in the military, and the scarcity of men in England and France, this large group of young and strong American men naturally became the coveted objects in the eyes of English and French women. On one side, Luo Fu had no husband, and on the other, the envoy had no wife, so they naturally hit it off. Moreover, America is a paradise in the eyes of women around the world, and everyone wants to marry a strong American husband. After the peace, American troops withdrew from Europe, followed by ship after ship of war brides and Victory Babies. Tens of thousands landed in New York each time, and they were transported for a full two years before tens of thousands of war brides and Victory Babies were brought over.

The English and French lost both their wives and soldiers in this war, but the Americans gained hundreds of thousands of outstanding people without any effort. These hundreds of thousands of new population were, of course, the result of the hard work of American soldiers. American women inevitably felt jealous of these new sisters-in-law because they had taken away the fiancés of American girls, but what could be done about the "fait accompli"? Chinese-American soldiers and American soldiers stationed in China also married many war brides in China. These Chinese women who married American soldiers, including dancers, socialites, Jeep girls, and daughters of modest families, were also quite numerous. They have now been sent to the United States in batches by special American government ships. The last batch of about one hundred people gathered in Guangzhou, transferred to Hong Kong, and sailed across the ocean to the United States. Most of these Chinese war brides cannot speak English, so taking care of them along the way is quite troublesome. More than four hundred people have already departed from Shanghai for the United States. Each time, senior American officers were sent to lead the team, and translators were selected to take care of them on board. These Chinese women had never set foot abroad in their lives, and some had never even left Shanghai. They knew nothing about the new family life in the United States. The escorts set up an English literacy class on the ship and taught them to read "O-P-C-T" and speak simple English every day. After the ship arrived in New York, the escorts' responsibilities were not yet over. They also had to send them to their new families in various parts of the United States and complete the formal transfer procedures. About 40 percent are in Chinatown in New York, 40 percent are in Chinatown in San Francisco, and the rest are scattered throughout the United States. There are also many speculators who took advantage of their brief relationship with American soldiers to pretend to be war brides and go to the United States. Therefore, the American authorities must verify the marriage certificate. Therefore, at a certain time, they were busy trying to obtain proof documents. These proof documents were more valuable than the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' passports because those who obtained the proof documents could not only securely obtain American citizenship but also arrive safely in the New World for free.

### Idle Chat in the Bean Arbor

— Fang Wuzhi

Tang Ju said to Lord Xinling: "There are things that cannot be known, and there are things that cannot not be known; there are things that should not be forgotten, and there are things that cannot but be forgotten."

His original intention was: I cannot not know other people's hatred of me; I am dissatisfied with others, but I cannot let others know; I cannot forget people's kindness to me; I cannot but forget my kindness to people.

In today's era of reprinting and selling "Thick Black Philosophy," there are things that can be known, and there are things that cannot be known; there are things to be forgotten, and there are things that cannot be forgotten.

Pretend to be deaf and mute to other people's hatred of me, things that cannot be known; my hatred of people, wanting to put them to death, things that can be known; remembering little of others' kindness, things to be forgotten; speaking about my kindness to people whenever I meet them, things that cannot be forgotten.

Who is it that says, "Wuji respectfully receives your teaching" as Tang Ju did?

The Duke of Windsor abandoned the throne for love. This is the most triumphant citation by those who advocate "unconditional love." But these are all past events.

Some women use the other party's status, reputation, and wealth as conditions. In fact, these conditions are just the price of "selling themselves."

"Rosy cheeks and white hair set off each other beautifully," which is precisely the result of multiple transactions opened or secondarily concluded in the love market.

### In Memory of Huating (Part Two)

— Yin

—An Introduction to Martyred Journalists

He could get colleagues who liked to be alone to go to the street with him, half-reluctantly; he could get friends who were taciturn to open up to him, whether they wanted to or not. If two people were feeling suffocated in a room, as soon as he arrived, those two friends would be like withered weeds, covered with morning dew, not growing immediately, but with hope of revival.

He was like yeast in friendship, which could make a bun benefit from his action; tall, fluffy, vigorous, and full of vitality; he could also make a steamer of steamed buns be pushed by him, the steam was steaming, and they collectively exerted themselves.

Therefore, at any most important time or occasion, with his few words, he could make the stubborn become honest and the cowardly become upright; the passive become active, and those who sat up rise up and act. He could not only speak, but also do. Whether it was coughing, talking and laughing, a gesture, or a footstep, they were all manifestations of his whole body's vitality.

Because of this, Huating hated evil like an enemy and never compromised. What his heart hated, he often gnashed his teeth, and his expression was stern. Not only did he show it in his face, he simply wanted to resort to force. Those who understood him naturally didn't care, but because he was too straightforward and lacked restraint, he was finally taken advantage of by his enemies, which is very regrettable.

Like other patriotic martyrs, Huating did not engage in production during his lifetime, and he was very impoverished after his death. No one supported his wife and children. Five years ago, he played the main role in a tragedy. Who knew that five years later, the national victory he had hoped for had long been achieved, but his family is still shrouded in dark clouds and gloom; the government's commendation and society's respect cannot stop the crying of his children or break through the cold atmosphere. They still have no source of funds for even the simplest living and educational expenses.

A few weeks before Huating's death, one day, he said to Langxuan with great emotion, "My children are young, what will they live on if something happens to me?" Another day, he sat alone at his writing desk, and for no reason, he wrote dozens of "family education" characters horizontally and vertically on paper. Huating was naturally optimistic and full of courage in life. He usually didn't know what melancholy and depression were. These two things can be said to be the subconscious expression of his inner self. We can easily imagine his mood at the time.

Can we completely lower the curtain on Huating's tragedy so that his children can be immersed in the glory of their father's sacrifice for the country, while avoiding being the objects of worry that their father was worried about while he was still alive?
