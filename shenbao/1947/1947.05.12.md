[Report from this newspaper's Xuzhou Office, 11th] The National Army, which recovered Laiwu, continued on the 11th to pursue the defeated communist army along two routes, Laiwu-Boshan and Laiwu-Tusi Pass. In the afternoon, they successively recovered Xiaoyi Village, five kilometers northeast of Laiwu, Qin Village, six kilometers northwest of Laiwu, and Jiangjia Building. The National Army, which swept the mountains southwest of Laiwu, captured Xujia Village, seven kilometers from the city, and Xiangshankou and other high grounds on the 11th. Meiyang was also recovered by the National Army.

[Report from this newspaper's Jinan Office, 11th] The National Army, taking advantage of their victory, recovered Tusi Pass, a key point north of Laiwu, at 2:00 PM on the 11th, and continued to mop up the surrounding area. By the evening of the 11th, the communist army had been cleared within ten Chinese miles northeast of Tusi Pass and retreated towards Zibo while fighting. The National Army is continuing to pursue them. Wang Yaowu's troops, who were flanking from Zaoyuan Temple to the east, arrived near Mingshui on the 11th. It is expected that the two National Army routes will officially converge between Tusi Pass and Mingshui.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 11th] The Chinese National Army in Shandong achieved a great victory. After the National Army regained control of Laiwu County, the severely damaged main force of the communist army is now fleeing through Boshan and Zichuan towards the vicinity of Zhangdian. Another part of them is fleeing through Tusi Pass towards Zuwen Town (north of Tusi Pass). After this fierce battle in Laiwu, the communist military situation in Shandong is gradually approaching its end.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th] The battle in the Yimeng Mountains is nearing its end. The war situation in Shandong Province is gradually developing towards the central section of the Jiaoji Railway. After the National Army gained control of the entire western, southern, and northern Yimeng Mountains, the eight remaining cities in the northeast and southeast corners, Zichuan, Boshan, Linqu, Anqiu, Yishui, Juxian, Zhucheng, and Rizhao, are currently being mopped up by the National Army. The communist army, which fled northeast from Laiwu, declared that they would re-invade Weixian in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway and establish a new base in Laiyang on the Shandong Peninsula. The National Army is now taking advantage of their unsteady breathing and vigorously pursuing and annihilating them.

[Another dispatch] Yishui and Juxian were already within the artillery range of Tang Enbo's army corps on the 10th. Tanbu, west of Yishui, and Xiazhuang, Jiehu, Aishan, and Pingse, southwest of Juxian, are now occupied by the National Army.

[Report from this newspaper's Xuzhou Office, 11th] The National Army, advancing towards Juxian along the right bank of the Shu River, reached Baidichou and Xiaodian, nine kilometers southwest of Juxian, on the 11th. Another National Army route searched and suppressed Dadian, fourteen kilometers southwest of Juxian, and almost completely annihilated more than 2,000 communist troops near Xiadian at 1:00 PM.

[Report from this newspaper's Xuzhou Office, 11th] The National Army at Mengyin Village on the Laiwu-Xintai highway continued to sweep the remaining communist troops in the surrounding steep mountainous areas on the 11th. Taohuayu, five kilometers west of Mengyin Village, Qingquan Ridge, seven kilometers away, Gaoyu, and Huangshan, Daxiao Shangyu, three kilometers southeast, were all captured by the National Army.

[Report from this newspaper's Jinan Office, 10th] According to a military observer, although the Shandong communist army still controls four columns on the rear side of the National Army, the Second Column in Yishui and the Seventh Column in Dadian, south of Juxian, have been mostly annihilated by the National Army's First Army Corps, and their combat effectiveness is extremely weak. As for the Ninth Column north of Mengyin, it is under close surveillance by the National Army. The Sixth Column has been surrounded in Dabianqiao, between Xintai and Sishui, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them all. In addition, the Zhang Guangzhong unit of the Lunan Military Region of the Communist Army, consisting of more than a thousand people in the mountainous area southeast of Yanzhou, are all guerrillas and militias and are not worth worrying about. In total, the communist army's losses in this battle should reach at least one-third or more. Finally, regarding the future movements of the Shandong communist army, there are three possible paths: (1) cross the Yellow River and flee north, (2) engage in another decisive battle with the National Army on the Jiaoji Railway, and (3) break up into smaller units and continue to hide in the Yimeng Mountains, choosing favorable times and locations to wear down the National Army.

### Urgent Measures to be Amended: Allocation of Goods to be Expanded; Adjustment of Public Utility Prices Under Consideration

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 11th] The authorities are conducting a detailed study of the effectiveness of the economic emergency measures implemented thus far. According to authoritative sources, certain aspects of the plan are likely to be amended. With the cost of living already unfrozen, it seems unavoidable that subsidy policies will be reintroduced, and changes to the method of allocating goods are also deemed necessary. There are also many other areas that require further discussion. However, measures such as the control of gold and currency will continue to be strictly enforced. It is also rumored that prices for various public utilities may be slightly adjusted in the near future.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 11th] A senior official from the Executive Yuan told reporters on the 11th that the authorities are considering expanding the scope of the goods allocation program so that workers and ordinary citizens can universally benefit from it. However, the variety of goods allocated may be reduced. Currently, the allocation system is only implemented in Nanjing and Shanghai. In the future, it may be expanded to six or seven major cities, including Peiping (Beijing) and Tianjin. Regarding the adjustment of salaries for public school teachers and civil servants, a final decision is expected at the upcoming Executive Yuan meeting next week. Educational institutions and other departments have suggested adjusting salaries regardless of region, while establishing a separate method for allocating goods so that benefits are equal. The Accounting Department of the Executive Yuan is currently working on both regional and non-regional adjustment plans. Whether or not adjustments will be regional is currently unknown. However, it is believed that after this adjustment, the living standards of general public school teachers and civil servants will be significantly improved.

### Ministry of Finance Entrusts Post Offices to Handle the Collection of Reserve Funds from Banks and Money Shops

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] To manage banks and money shops across the country, control credit, and regulate finance, the Ministry of Finance implemented a measure in 1944 to collect ordinary deposit reserve funds from commercial banks and money shops. This business was originally handled by the Central Bank itself or entrusted to the four banks. However, the Central Bank, considering that the branch networks of the four banks could not be universally implemented, specifically entrusted post offices in areas without the four banks to handle the matter. It is reported that the Postal Remittance Bureau has issued a notice to all second-class and above post offices across the country to universally accept the entrustment and assist the government in implementing financial policies.

### In Order to Reduce Issuance and Absorb Floating Capital, the Government Will Issue Special Short-Term Treasury Bills; Methods Under Study

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 11th] To reduce issuance and absorb floating capital, the authorities will issue special short-term treasury bills in the near future. Detailed methods are currently being studied by Yu Hong-jun, Zhang Jia-ao, and others. It is reported that these treasury bills may have a term of one to three months, with interest rates the same as the highest in the market. National banks will be responsible for them, and commercial banks across the country will handle redemption procedures. Purchasers will buy them at 80% or 85% of face value in cash, and they will be redeemed at full value upon maturity. A financial expert analyzed the advantages of these new treasury bills to reporters on the 11th, pointing out that the key to ordinary treasury bill issuance is the level of interest. The sales of US treasury bills have been affected due to interest rate considerations. The special short-term treasury bills to be issued in the future will have the same interest rate as the market, and the credit of national banks is generally higher than that of ordinary banks. This is equivalent to fixed-term deposits, and it is believed that they will be able to absorb a large amount of floating capital. After the issuance of these treasury bills, there will be at least the following beneficial effects: (1) reduced issuance, (2) floating capital will not rush to purchase goods, prices will stabilize, and interest rates will fall accordingly. Finally, he optimistically stated that if the authorities can simultaneously advance in controlling prices and stabilizing the currency value after the issuance of special short-term treasury bills, the economic situation will not be difficult to improve.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 11th] The Peiping (Beijing) City subscription and sales amount for the 1947 short-term treasury bills and US dollar bonds is US$10 million, of which US dollar bonds account for one-quarter and short-term treasury bills account for three-quarters. According to the person in charge of the subscription and sales committee, the prospects for subscription and sales in Peiping are very optimistic, with many subscribers within the first two days.

### Xue Du-bi Returns to Beijing and Speaks; Yellow River Treatment Project to be Completed by Mid-July; 67 Billion Spent on Closing the Breach

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 11th] Minister of Water Conservancy Xue Du-bi and his party returned to Beijing on the morning of the 11th and will report to the Chairman on the inspection of the flooded area. When reporters interviewed Xue, asking him to discuss the inspection situation, he said: Regarding the Yellow River breach closure project, the closure project has been completed, and the current project is to raise the height of the embankment, which is being carried out by tens of thousands of workers daily and is expected to be completed by the end of May. The embankment repair project can be completed by mid-July, and the Yellow River treatment project will come to an end. The fundamental treatment plan had a planning organization last year and is being researched and formulated. Regarding the reorganization of the flooded area, six survey teams have been sent to conduct a comprehensive survey of the entire flooded area, followed by the reorganization of the river course. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA) has also drafted a "Revival Zone" plan for the reorganization of the flooded area, which will be designed and implemented jointly by various institutions such as the Water Conservancy, Land Administration, and ERRRA. Xue said that the total expenditure for this breach closure project was 67 billion. Xue said that refugees seen on this trip include flood victims returning from the flooded area and refugees fleeing from the Communist-controlled area. They have no clothes, no food, and no shelter, which is extremely tragic. Fortunately, the ERRRA's sub-office in Henan has set up refugee relief funds, congee kitchens, orphanages, work-study schools, and factories everywhere, so that refugees can return and have a place to rely on. The factories are especially well-coordinated by taking local materials to make what is needed. However, the most important thing at present is the stability of order, which still requires a solution to political problems.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Xue Du-bi told reporters that according to the conversations with refugees who fled from the Communist-controlled areas of Puyang County and other places in the flooded area, he learned that the Communist army regards people's lives as if they were grass. Every county holds meetings and takes struggle actions, brutally killing the people. There is a cruel torture called the "Chiang Kai-shek pole," which involves tying the "struggled against" person to the top of a tenon, then cutting the rope, causing them to fall from the air into a pre-set forest of knives or sharpened wooden poles. The horrific death is appalling.

Editorial

### Closely Watching the Development of the Japanese Political Situation

After the Japanese elections in April, the new constitution will be officially implemented starting May 3rd. The "Constitution of the Empire of Japan," promulgated in Meiji 22 (1889), will have ended its 58-year life. According to custom, the current cabinet should resign within 30 days after the general election. In accordance with Articles 67 and 68 of the new constitution, the Prime Minister should be elected by the Diet. The first Diet session after the general election is scheduled to convene on May 20th, and Emperor Hirohito has ordered Yoshida to convene the Diet on the 28th. Therefore, this two-and-a-half-week period is a time of intense political upheaval in Japan, and all changes and developments depend on this stage. So far, the most notable developments in the Japanese political situation are: first, the purge of Finance Minister Ishibashi, which dealt a major blow to the Liberal Party; second, the activity of the Socialist Party, hoping that the Diet will decide to appoint a prime minister from their party; and third, the growing consensus among the Liberal, Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties regarding the formation of a unified national cabinet. These developments are all new factors that will determine Japan's future political situation and are worthy of our close attention.

We had predicted that the conservative forces would gain an overwhelming advantage in the Japanese elections in April. The growth of conservative forces is not only unfortunate for Japanese democratic politics but also a disaster for future Asian peace. As expected, the victory of conservative forces in the local administrative head elections in Japan has become a foregone conclusion, and the elections of the central Diet and local assemblies also reflect the Japanese public opinion that Japanese politics is still actively leaning towards conservatism. The results of the election for 150 members of the House of Councillors on April 20th are as follows: Liberal Party, 32 seats; Socialist Party, 29 seats; Democratic Party, 24 seats; National Cooperative Party, 6 seats; minor parties, 5 seats; Communist Party, 1 seat; independents, 53 seats. In summary, conservative forces hold 109 seats, the left wing holds 30 seats, and the centrists hold 11 seats. The results of the election for 466 members of the House of Representatives on April 25th are as follows: Socialist Party, 143 seats; Liberal Party, 133 seats; Democratic Party, 126 seats; National Cooperative Party, 31 seats; minor parties, 16 seats; Communist Party, 4 seats; independents, 13 seats. In summary, the socialists have emerged as the largest party, holding the most seats in the lower house. The Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Yoshida, lost the most seats in the lower house, and the Democratic Party, led by Shidehara, ranks third. The parties representing conservative forces have slightly declined, but the combined seats of the Liberal and Democratic parties, which share the same lineage, still outweigh those of the Socialist Party. The fixed number of members for the national local assemblies is 2,495. The election results announced on April 30th covered 2,484 members, including 517 from the Democratic Party, 469 from the Liberal Party, 414 from the Socialist Party, 133 from the National Cooperative Party, 177 from minor parties, 3 from the Communist Party, and 771 independents. If divided into left and conservative, the conservative parties hold 1,622 seats, while the left wing holds only 562 seats. Clearly, the Japanese public opinion institutions, from the central to the local level, are dominated by conservative forces, and the future political trend is very clear.

Given the overall trend of the elections, who will be responsible for forming the cabinet after the opening of the new Diet? Will it be led by the Socialist Party, or will a coalition government be formed by three or four parties? The trends can be observed before the opening of the Diet, and decisions can be made after the opening of the Diet. After the announcement of the House of Representatives members, the parties remained silent, but the Socialist Party held frequent meetings and discussions, deciding that "our party deeply feels the great responsibility of being the largest party after the general election and is willing to devote all efforts to realizing a national political system." They advocated that after Yoshida submits his resignation on May 6th, the party chairman, Katayama Tetsu, should lead the cabinet formation movement. The left wing of the party insisted that Katayama should serve as the future prime minister and recruit other parties to form a coalition government. The right wing of the party recognized the strength of the conservative forces and the possibility of regaining leadership in the Diet, and even the possibility that Yoshida might use "purge" orders to remove the seats of the Socialist Party. Therefore, they strongly advocated that Socialist Party members do not need to serve as prime minister in the future coalition government, but only request to head the four ministries of Finance, Agriculture and Forestry, Labor (not yet established), and Economic Stabilization. Yoshida of the Liberal Party stated that he would never cling to the position of prime minister, but on the 6th, he delayed the date of his resignation, apparently with other plans. Shidehara's attitude was "inaction," and key members of the Democratic Party generally opposed Katayama serving as prime minister, with even Ashida Hitoshi believing that Katayama's appointment as prime minister was impossible. The party conflicts among the Japanese are fierce, but their spirit of unity in "loyalty to the emperor and love for the country" can be above everything else in today's situation. Therefore, the contradiction of their party interests may change from opposition to unity. On May 3rd, the day the new constitution was implemented, all parties unanimously appealed to remember the difficulties of the times and demanded to jointly create a new Japan, filled with the spirit of perseverance and determination to rise again when facing a cliff. From this point of view, we predict that the evolution of the Japanese political situation will recover to stability after a short period of intense upheaval.

Some people predict that the current Japanese political situation has many contradictions, and conservative forces will definitely prevent the Socialist Party from forming a cabinet. We believe this kind of speculation is wrong. Let's look at the facts: Yoshida should have resigned on the 6th, but Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Joji announced on the 6th that the resignation would be postponed, and the Socialist Party and other parties did not express any objection. The 20th was the date for the opening of the Diet, but Emperor Hirohito suddenly ordered a postponement, indicating that the Japanese parties and the Japanese regime must obtain out-of-session coordination before the opening of the Diet, so as not to have infighting and struggles in the Diet. On the 8th, Yoshida and Katayama held talks, and on the 9th, the leaders of the four parties held a meeting, and immediately issued a declaration after the meeting: "In view of the importance of the current situation, all parties are willing to abandon their prejudices and realize a four-party coalition cabinet, in order to jointly bear the responsibility of overcoming the difficulties." This declaration is earnest and sincere! The Socialist Party, Liberal Party, Democratic Party, and National Cooperative Party are the four major parties in the Japanese political arena today. With the coordination of the heads of the four parties, whether Katayama will serve as the next prime minister, or Yoshida will remain in office, or Shidehara or Ashida will serve as prime minister, are all unimportant questions. The most important thing is that they can quickly abandon their prejudices, compete in the formulation of policies, look at the content of the policies, and then decide on the preferred candidate. The Liberal Party holds this view, and the Socialist Party also advocates the same. Therefore, the Japanese political situation in turmoil is now showing signs of calmness. Due to the coordination of the four parties, which party will lead the formation of the cabinet? Who will serve as prime minister? These are not serious issues in the political situation. Therefore, the future cabinet will definitely be successfully organized as a coalition government without the Communist Party, with each party jointly governing and jointly bearing national responsibility, which is almost certain.

The current stage of Japanese politics can be said to be the beginning of a new era. Although this page of history is new, the characters are still old, the ambitions and aspirations are still old, and there is a lurking kind of terrible undercurrent. Most Japanese people aspire to be Goujian, especially politicians aspire to be Fan Li. This ideological undercurrent is now growing on the Japanese archipelago, and we should be especially vigilant about the Japanese political situation.

### Heated Debate Between US and Soviet Representatives on Future Status of Palestine; Result Submitted to 15-Nation Subcommittee for Review

[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] The United Nations today at least temporarily shelved the compromise proposals of the Philippines, Iraq, Colombia, and India, and appointed a new ad hoc committee to break the deadlock on the Palestinian independence issue. When the United States opposed Soviet and Arab demands for the United Nations to draft a plan for immediate Palestinian independence, the dispute was referred back to the subcommittee for discussion. US Representative Johnson told the 55-nation Political Committee that no country opposed Palestine declaring independence at an appropriate time, but the timing issue could only be decided after the Inquiry Committee thoroughly studied the Palestine issue. Soviet Representative Gromyko spoke twice, insisting that the United Nations should immediately promote the independence of Palestine and should not just engage in empty talk. Johnson argued that the United States was not "uncompromising" and was willing to have the Inquiry Committee decide whether to propose that Palestine declare independence at this time. The Inquiry Committee is currently being organized and is expected to submit a report in September. After several compromise proposals and amendments were put forward, the Political Committee canceled the meeting originally scheduled for this afternoon and organized another subcommittee. The new subcommittee includes the previous eleven members of the subcommittee, plus representatives from Iran, India, Colombia, and the Philippines. The 15-nation subcommittee then held a closed meeting and is scheduled to present the results of the discussion to the Political Committee on the 11th.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] The United Nations has been discussing the Palestine issue for two weeks, but the main issue, the future status of the Holy Land, has not yet been resolved. Judging from the opinions of all parties, there are two possible solutions: one is to divide Palestine into two states, Jewish and Arab, and the other is to entrust the Holy Land to a United Nations agency for five years. Opinions within the Jewish community are also not unified. It is reported that some Zionists support partition, but on the condition that the land obtained by the Jewish and Arab states should be equal. Another faction believes that once partition is accepted, it will be impossible to reverse it, so they oppose quickly accepting the partition proposal and prefer to entrust it to the United Nations first. Rabbi Silver, chairman of the Zionist Organization of America, also believes that it is not advisable to establish a Jewish state until a sufficient number of Jews have immigrated to obtain a majority of the population. Currently, there are only about 600,000 Jews in the Holy Land, while there are more than one million Arabs. As for the Arab countries, they demand immediate independence in order to maintain their majority advantage.

### Documents Suddenly Released Amidst UN General Assembly Meeting Proving Huseini Conspired with Germany

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th] Several copied archives were released here today, proving the process of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Huseini, colluding with the Axis powers. Among them is a letter from Huseini to Himmler, the leader of the German political police, regarding their plan to jointly reduce the Jewish population. At the same time, Nazi documents seized from the Japanese and Italian embassies and Huseini's private files also revealed that the Arab leader had spread Axis propaganda to Muslims from Morocco to Indonesia and planned to organize an Arab army to assist the Nazi army in combat.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 11th] The vice-chairman of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee, Huseini, is scheduled to fly to Cairo today to meet with the chairman of the committee, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Huseini. The talks will likely be related to the developments of the UN General Assembly meeting. It is said that Vice-Chairman Huseini will personally go to New York to attend the United Nations meeting.

### US Promoting New Plan to Modify Lend-Lease Act in Peacetime Enabling European and Asian Democracies to Achieve Economic Self-Reliance

[United Press, Washington, 10th] The US government is now attempting to shift the focus of the "Truman Doctrine" from the theory of the anti-communist crusade to economic measures to rebuild Western Europe and the democracies of the Far East. Officials believe that the "Truman Doctrine" is America's world policy, and they will make this plan a peacetime Lend-Lease Act measure. Truman's current concern is how to prevent economic collapse in Western Europe and the Far East. Senior officials firmly believe that the most important way to reduce the communist forces in Western Europe and the Far East is to enable the countries there to be economically self-reliant. Undersecretary of State Acheson recently gave a speech in Cleveland, calling for the immediate revival of the economies of Germany and Japan and calling for certain economic measures, such as extending the wartime export control law. This speech was the first step in starting this transformation movement.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Walter Lippmann, a Washington Post reporter who is often seen as reflecting the views of the State Department, predicted that the US government will have to restore some form of lend-lease system within the next twelve months. Lippmann said that the living standards in Europe may collapse across the board. In the coming months, at most twelve months, the United States will have to restore some form of lend-lease system, which will require at least $5 billion annually, and this lend-lease aid will inevitably have to continue for several years. Lippmann believes that Undersecretary of State Acheson's speech in Cleveland two days ago was the first step in announcing this plan to the American public. Acheson's words confirmed the belief of those in charge here that the world will soon face a general shortage of US dollars, and officials also believe that unless a foreign aid plan that is broader than the aid to Greece, Turkey, and Korea is implemented, many countries will inevitably feel an unprecedented shortage due to the lack of US dollars. It is reported that the countries currently lacking US dollars not only include Britain and France, but also countries such as Sweden and Mexico, which have always been seen as prosperous, are also facing the same crisis. Currently, many countries have already spent all their money to buy goods, and the US federal gold reserves recently increased by $150 million in one week. Therefore, only the United States can provide assistance to other countries.

### Truman Doctrine Coincides with Hoover's Recommendations

[United Press, Washington, 11th] According to today's news, former President Hoover, about 28 years ago, when he was serving as Director of Relief in Europe, proposed a plan very similar to the "Truman Doctrine." Hoover suggested that the United States use all possible means to help Europe overcome post-war economic difficulties, but he put forward the following conditions: that the United States "must insist that any country that is not determined to stabilize its domestic financial and political situation cannot be given assistance." The discovery of this recommendation was due to the State Department publishing its tenth volume of documents on the 1919 Paris Peace Conference.

### Greek Foreign Minister Praises US Aid Plan

Amnesty Measures Being Negotiated with the US

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 10th] Regarding US aid to Greece, Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris commented, "It is inappropriate to call it 'relief' or 'aid.' In fact, it is an extension of the Lend-Lease Act, and its purpose is to make democratic principles triumph among the United Nations, especially among the countries that suffered heavy losses during the war. Greece has now become a very important air base, and this alone is enough to make the United States concerned about Greece reasonable. In addition, there is also a strategic issue. The last war has proven the unreliability of defensive positions, but Greece will surely become a powerful vanguard for directly penetrating the iron heart of the Middle East."

[United Press, Athens, 11th] The Greek government "generally" agreed to the US proposal for international supervision of amnesty in order to attract an estimated 15,000 guerrillas in the mountains to return. However, a condition was put forward in a note to US Ambassador to Greece MacVeagh, namely, that the UN-supervised amnesty method recommended by the Balkan Inquiry Committee must be cancelled. MacVeagh asked the United States to clarify its proposal as merely a "pure amnesty." It is expected that the US reply will be submitted early next week. It is reported that although the US proposal is only a suggestion, it contains a threat that the US will terminate aid to Greece to support the US proposal.

### Molotov Accepts US Conditions; US Determination to Aid Korea Unchanged; If All of Korea is Unified, Aid will be Extended to the Entire Territory

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Although US officials welcomed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's acceptance of the US conditions for reopening the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea, they considered it not entirely unexpected. They believe that the Soviet Union's agreement to the US conditions for the meeting is the ultimate result of the US's tough stance on the Korean issue. The only question is when will this be realized. The US assumes that the Soviet Union's willingness to do so will be conditional on the situation in their northern occupied zone. However, Molotov's acceptance of the US conditions is not enough to change the US's determination to provide massive economic aid to Korea. If Korea has been unified when this aid is implemented, it will be extended to the entire territory. Molotov's refusal to allow all political groups in Korea to freely express their opinions according to the proposal in Marshall's letter of May 2 and acceptance of the most generous conditions ever allowed by the United States is seen as his clever choice.

### MacArthur Releases Report on Occupation of South Korea

US Doing Everything Possible to Promote Korean Independence

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] MacArthur released the US military's report on the occupation of southern Korea for February today, stating that the US military authorities there have appointed more Koreans to important government positions in preparation for the country's complete autonomy in the future. The Koreans' opposition to trusteeship is very strong, and they long for independence as soon as possible. US military commander Hodge expressed great sympathy for this and stated that the United States is doing everything possible to promote it. The US military authorities have repeatedly stated that they will do their best to enable Koreans to freely preside over all departments of their government. The US military government has thoroughly discussed issues such as agriculture, forestry, finance, industry, commerce, government reorganization, and election law with the Koreans. Production in southern Korea has greatly improved.

### Undercurrents Lurking in Japanese Political Situation; Conservative Factions Striving; New Cabinet Policies Will Cause Disputes

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The Bihara faction of the Democratic Party believes that if a common front of conservative elements from all parties is possible, then the Democratic Party should serve as prime minister. The new faction of the party also believes that the issue of the prime minister should not be decided separately from the issue of the ratio of cabinet posts. Therefore, the result of the four-party secretary-general meeting on the 12th will be that the conservative elements will seize the initiative, and they will decide their attitude after the Socialist Party puts forward a plan to deal with the political situation, including the ratio of cabinet posts.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] Regarding the issue of the Socialist Party forming a cabinet, although a coalition cabinet was unanimously approved at the four-party representative meeting on the 9th, the basic knot seems to still exist in the struggle between conservative forces and socialist forces, that is, the future of Japanese politics tending to the left or the right. Although the four-party secretary-general meeting has been scheduled for the 12th, such basic issues cannot be decided by a few meetings. Currently, the parties are mostly adopting a reserved attitude on issues such as policies, the choice of prime minister, and the ratio of cabinet posts. For example, regarding policies, the Liberal Party will still base itself on its original policies. In addition, the National Cooperative Party still insists on: (1) advocating the enactment of the Agricultural Cooperative Association Law based on the democratization of the rural economy; (2) the new yen issue should be legalized at the four-party meeting; (3) opposing state ownership of important enterprises; and (4) establishing an elementary school system for workers.

Then Princess Margaret took over and was ordered to steer the ship 25 degrees to the right. The princess looked at the gauge and turned the rudder to restore the ship to its original course.

### Britain's High Debt; Bevin's Confidence Remains Strong

[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in a speech in his Woolwich constituency today, "When I returned from Moscow and passed through Berlin, I saw that the city was still in ruins two years after the end of the war. Therefore, I don't feel complacent about victory, but rather feel that the people who caused the war suffered the most tragic consequences. I sincerely hope to preserve all the remaining things and the essence of humanity in order to prevent war from breaking out again. We have now mortgaged almost everything we have and sold everything off, leaving us destitute. We now have a domestic debt of 2.5 billion pounds and a foreign debt of nearly 3 billion pounds, but we are not discouraged by this. On the contrary, we feel that we should still be a great leader in the world, morally leading the world, so as to contribute to the progress of mankind."

### British Cabinet to Hold Meeting: Thorough Examination of Indian Situation; Governor-General to Announce Political Transfer Plan on Schedule

[Reuters, London, May 10th] Lord Ismay, special envoy of Governor-General Lord Mountbatten, is scheduled to depart for New Delhi on Wednesday or Thursday. The British Cabinet will hold a comprehensive discussion on the Indian situation on Monday or Tuesday, so that Lord Ismay can convey the British Cabinet's response to the report submitted by the Governor-General to Mountbatten.

[Reuters, Simla, May 10th] It was announced here today: Governor-General Lord Mountbatten is scheduled to inform Indian leaders of the plan to transfer power to India in New Delhi on the 17th of this month.

The Indian leaders invited to meet with the Governor-General include Nehru, Vice President of the Indian Interim Government, Jinnah, President of the Muslim League, and Singh, Sikh leader and Minister of Defense of the Indian Interim Government. In addition, the Governor-General has invited representatives of the Indian princely states who participated in the negotiations on the issue of the states joining the Constituent Assembly to meet with him on the afternoon of May 17th.

### Muslim League Considers: Changing Attitude

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, May 11th] It has been learned that the Muslim League has agreed to reconsider its decision to take direct action made in July 1946. As a result of this action, a round table conference will be convened between Indian political leaders and Governor-General Mountbatten on the 17th of this month to study the British government's issue of transferring power to the Indians.

### Exchange of Notes Between Britain and Siam: Does Not Involve Land Issues

Former Siamese Prime Minister Arrives in Washington for Discussions

[Reuters, London, May 10th] Authoritative sources here stated that the exchange of notes between Britain and Siam in Bangkok only involves enemy property in Siam and the return of Allied property by Siam, and does not involve land issues. The exchanged notes are actually a supplement to the peace agreement signed between Britain and Siam on January 1, 1946, which stipulates that Siam declares any land taken from Britain by Siam after December 7, 1941, to be invalid. The contents of the recent exchange of notes include: (1) Siam should hand over Japanese property and other enemy property within its borders to the Allies for disposal; (2) Siam should return the property rights and interests of countries that declared war on Siam in Siam; (3) Siam should provide adequate currency as the maintenance fee for British troops in Siam.

[Central News Agency, Washington, May 10th, United Press] Bidyaphorn Bunnag, former Siamese Prime Minister and political advisor to the Siamese representative on the neutral arbitration committee responsible for the Vietnam-Siam border demarcation, arrived here today. Mr. Bidyaphorn indicated that he will stay for about a week to engage in consultations.

### France and Vietnam Explore Peace: Gradually Entering Concrete Stage

[Reuters, Saigon, May 10th] Peace explorations between the French and Viet Minh sides have been underway here and outside Vietnam for three weeks. It is expected that after Vietnamese Governor Bollaert arrives in Hanoi on Wednesday, this peace exploration work will become more concrete. Reliable sources said that a letter containing the Viet Minh government's peace proposals has been delivered to Mousse, Bollaert's personal representative in Hanoi. After Mr. Bollaert arrives in Hanoi, he will stay for three days, during which he will deliver a public speech, the content of which will be of great importance to the Vietnamese political situation. Mr. Bollaert is scheduled to leave Vietnam for Paris on May 26th and will not be able to return to Vietnam until mid-June. The final solution to the Vietnamese situation will have to wait until Mr. Bollaert returns to Vietnam from France.

Viet Minh's New Party Quite Active

At the same time, as preliminary negotiations become increasingly tense, several small Vietnamese parties have united to form a new party called the "All-Vietnam Alliance National Front" in order to negotiate with the French authorities. The party issued a declaration today, claiming that former Annam King Bao Dai is the leader of the new party, and stated that they have made contact with official intermediaries. The party's goal is the same as that of the party led by Ho Chi Minh, which is to unify and make the Viet Minh independent within the French Federation, but the new party denounces Ho Chi Minh's government as a communist and totalitarian regime, and therefore expresses its opposition.

### Madagascar Uprising: French Cabinet Resolves to Dissolve "Renovation Movement"

Malagasy Natives Launch Large-Scale Attacks, Fail

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, May 10th] The French cabinet held a meeting today, chaired by President Auriol, and immediately decided: (1) to dissolve the Madagascar Renovation Movement; (2) to ban the Madagascar Idealist Youth Association; (3) to establish a wheat purchasing committee. The Cabinet expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the Renault car company labor strike.

It is said that the main target of the native attack was the city's prison.

### Disclosure of Nazi Invasion History: Inner Story of Hess's Flight to England; Attempted to Persuade Britain to Accept Peace

[Reuters, Washington, May 10th] The US Army Department's massive eight-volume history of Nazi aggression was published today, revealing in detail the inside story of Hitler's Deputy Führer Hess's flight to England. After Hess arrived in England, he suggested to the Duke of Hamilton that he guarantee the territories of the British Empire in exchange for Britain's recognition of Germany's control over Europe. Hess also stated that Germany had no ambitions for the Americas and that the so-called German threat was nothing more than a fantasy, and Hitler's interests were limited to Europe. Hess also said that if Britain accepted peace, the United States would definitely be angry, because the United States' real intention was to inherit the British Empire. Hess suggested that Britain could have complete freedom of action within its empire, but Germany's former colonies should be returned to Germany. The Duke of Hamilton also said that when he discussed Germany's peace proposals with Hess, he also talked about the Irish issue. Hess said that he had never mentioned the Irish issue when talking to Hitler, and Ireland was irrelevant to Germany in this war, so he expected Hitler would not consider Anglo-Irish relations. The Nazi invasion history also revealed that the Nazi Air Force may have already been conducting high-altitude reconnaissance of the London area as early as 1939 or even 1938.

### Churchill Decorated in Paris Military Hospital

After French Prime Minister Ramadier read out the award certificate, he pinned the medal with the green-edged yellow ribbon on Churchill's uniform and kissed him on both cheeks. Thousands of people on the terrace cheered and part of the diplomatic and military officials shouted "Long live Churchill". Churchill shook hands with the French Prime Minister again, smiling broadly.

### Mayor Wu Returns to Shanghai After Seeking Instructions in Nanjing: Reaffirms Resolution to Stabilize Society; Points Out That Rationing Based on Headcount Can Be Implemented This Month After the Thaw; Those Who Take the Opportunity to Cause Trouble Will Be Severely Punished

Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai yesterday morning by overnight express train from Nanjing and attended a banquet hosted by Director of the Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang for the city's press at noon. During the banquet, Wu reported on his trip to Nanjing to seek instructions from the central authorities on policies to deal with the city's commodity prices and stabilize social order.

Wu first stated: The first thing that the four million citizens of the city need now is stability. However, the unstable phenomenon that occurred in May of the lunar year has reappeared. Unreasonable and unlawful actions are occurring from time to time, causing widespread instability throughout the city. Democracy should be based on abiding by the law. If one does not abide by the law, then how can one achieve democracy? How can one talk about democracy when one shouts democracy but exceeds the law? Democratic countries also have sanctions against the people, but they are sanctioned by law. Now that Shanghai's martial law has not been lifted, the government is determined to stabilize social order. In the future, those who are unreasonable, unlawful, and disrupt social order and peace will be severely dealt with according to the law. Those whose circumstances are serious will be handed over to military law according to the martial law, this is one.

Secondly, the central and local governments are determined to do their best to find solutions to the problems of rising prices and people's livelihoods. In the commodity price conference yesterday, a decision was made on the method of unfreezing and adjusting the workers' living index. It is stipulated that those with a base salary of less than 30 yuan will be paid according to the index, and those with a base salary of more than 30 yuan will be discounted at each level. This decision does not need to be approved by the Executive Yuan. Starting this month, workers' salaries can be implemented according to this method. Currently, the base salary of general workers in Shanghai is much higher than before the war. If all base salaries are paid according to the index, then factories will not be able to bear the burden and the entire industry will be in total collapse. On the one hand, the government is protecting the lives of workers, and on the other hand, it is considering the burden on factories, so it decided on this method. Otherwise, factories will be forced to close down due to the inability to bear the burden, and all workers will be unemployed, which will make the problem even more serious. Therefore, those who shout for unconditional unfreezing of the cost of living index today are not friends of the workers, but enemies of the workers. If there are other backgrounds that want to use the wage issue to create instability in Shanghai, then they are enemies of all the citizens of Shanghai. We should know that the current economic crisis is extremely serious, and both labor and management and all parties must make mutual sacrifices and concessions to overcome this difficult situation. Regarding the rice issue, the government authorities have given careful consideration. On the one hand, it requires low rice prices so that social life is not affected, and on the other hand, it fears that rice prices will be too low, causing the adverse effect of "cheap grain hurting farmers." Since the rice rush occurred, the municipal government has released 170,000 bags of rice to date. Because the allocated price is too low, 12 rice shops have had accidents due to citizens crowding and rushing to buy. Only five or six of them are serious. There are more than 2,000 rice shops in Shanghai. Now, those who have had accidents in the rice rush are still less than 1%, which does not seem to be too serious. In order to avoid crowding in the allocation and sale of rice in each rice shop, the government has decided to improve the allocation and sale method. Workers in factories, public and church personnel, and boarding students in schools will all be directly allocated rice by the municipal government. For the poor, the government will set up distribution stores and allocate rice based on headcount. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau is still staying in Nanjing, continuing to discuss the detailed methods of allocating and selling rice with the relevant authorities. It is expected that he can return to Shanghai by overnight train today (that is, the 11th). This method can be implemented in the city next week.

Finally, what must be solemnly stated is that the government is determined to maintain social order and stability, and to strictly enforce the rule of law. From today onwards, those who take the opportunity to cause trouble for the normal business of legitimate grain merchants will be severely dealt with. Rice merchants who beat people will also be strictly punished according to the law. As for the rice market, in addition to the North Market, which has already resumed business yesterday, I will convene the person in charge of the South Market for a talk tomorrow morning and send military police to protect it. The resumption of business tomorrow (the 12th) should also be no problem.

### Dong Xian Guang Receives Press Circle: Hope for Assistance to Government to Stabilize Hearts of the People; Assistance Promised for Difficulties of Press Circle

Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang and Deputy Director Deng You De arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing one after another the night before last. Yesterday afternoon, they hosted a reception for the city's press circle at the International Hotel for the first time. Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan were invited to participate, with a total of more than 60 people attending. Dong said in his speech: I have not yet formally assumed the position of Director of the Information Bureau, and the Information Bureau has not yet been formally established. The tasks of the Information Bureau are now on my shoulders and those of the two deputy directors. Given the occurrence of the rice rush and the seriousness of other situations, I urgently wanted to come to Shanghai to meet with you all. I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet with my colleagues and old friends today. In the future, please give more assistance to the government's administrative measures, especially in stabilizing people's hearts. Before the implementation of constitutional government, the power of newspapers is extremely great, and there are also many people who rely on the leadership of public opinion. At this time of fluctuating public sentiment, I deeply hope that when you write news comments and produce headlines, you will strive to be careful and avoid stimulation, so that the psychology of the people can be relatively stable. To give an example, such as the rice problem, due to the people's anxiety, those who have rice are unwilling to sell it, and those who have no rice are rushing to buy and store it. In such a situation, no matter how much rice there is, it will never be enough. Similar situations require the assistance of the press to stabilize people's hearts. The central and local governments are now determined to gradually seek solutions to various issues that are closely related to the people. Please give more assistance from the public opinion circle, and I hope you will give more guidance to the Information Bureau. If the press circle has any difficulties, I will also do my best to help solve them. Please also help the Information Bureau with the same effort.

After Mayor Wu announced the measures taken to seek instructions in Nanjing to deal with the city's commodity prices and stabilize social order (see above), people from the press circle successively expressed their opinions, and Director Dong and Mayor Wu responded separately.

Speaker Pan Expresses Four Points of Opinion

Speaker Pan Gongzhan contributed four points of opinion to the government authorities for stabilizing social order: (1) The current phenomenon in Shanghai of not talking about law but talking about force, if allowed to continue, will mean that Shanghai has no future, the entire country has no future, and it will fall into an irreversible situation. Since the mayor is determined to stabilize the community, he should immediately, under the guidance of the central government, work with the garrison headquarters to stop all illegal actions and deal with them according to the law. This measure will definitely be supported by the city's citizens. Recently, the demonstrations and petitions of the masses have hindered public transportation and social order, which is inappropriate. Any matter should be based on right and wrong. Today, right and wrong are not discussed, but only the number of people is used to compare strength. How can social order be stabilized if this is the case? Therefore, this point must be corrected. (2) All government measures should be considered from a broad perspective and should not add any more unstable factors. Before formulating laws and regulations, the central government must first carefully discuss them with the local authorities to avoid difficulties in implementation. (3) It is hoped that commodity prices will not continue to rise, and it is hoped that the central government will immediately decide on a method to stabilize commodity prices. However, before the method is decided, please ask the central government officials to say less. Because Shanghai is a speculative market, every word and deed of the central government officials can be used or misinterpreted by speculative merchants as good material for raising prices and stimulating the market. The index method decided by the commodity price conference is extremely reasonable, but it must be strongly implemented by the government and unanimously supported by people from all walks of life, and fully cooperated with the government to be smoothly promoted. Finally, Pan asked Mayor Wu to pay attention to the issue of "poor people" being allocated rice and should be specially and carefully considered with the Social Affairs Bureau, the scope of the so-called "poor people," so as to avoid disputes due to inconsistent standards.

Cheng Cangbo then spoke, requesting that the government's responsible authorities stabilize the press circle itself before seeking social stability. Deng Jixing of Xin Min Pao and Wang Jihua of Lianhe Wan Bao expressed sympathy for Cheng's call.

Technical Difficulties Should Be Understood

Hu Jianzhong spoke, in principle accepting Director Dong's statement to avoid publishing news with stimulating factors, but asked for understanding of the difficulties of news workers in technically handling news, inevitably there will be too much or too little. However, even if there is improper handling in technique, the motive is pure and without other intentions and should be understood. Finally, Cao Gubing, Li Zikuan, Zhang Cangping and others expressed their opinions separately. Cao Gubing expressed sincere gratitude to Director Dong for being willing to help the press circle solve difficulties. Li Zikuan asked the responsible authorities to pay attention to solving the problem of newspaper supply.

### Refusal to Sign Contract for Allocated Housing: Mayor Responsible for Negotiation

Zhang Cangping stated that for public and church personnel allocated housing, the stipulated unified rental period has expired. Although the Executive Yuan has clearly stipulated that existing tenants can negotiate with landlords to sign a lease and continue to live, most landlords and rental agents are unwilling to continue signing contracts with existing tenants in order to profit from high renewal fees and are trying to take back the houses to rent them out again. As a result, tens of thousands of public and church personnel living in allocated housing in the city will be homeless, which is a serious social problem, and asked Mayor Wu to properly resolve it under the principle of "stabilizing social order." Mayor Wu said that he had invited various property owners to talk a few days ago, hoping to negotiate leases with existing tenants. Most of the property owners agreed, only hoping to appropriately adjust the rent. If tenants currently living in allocated housing are rejected when negotiating a lease with the landlord, they can report to me, and I will be responsible for negotiating on their behalf. The reception ended at around 2:00 pm.

### Reclaiming the Racecourse: A Citizen Suggests Participating in the Conference; Issuing Lottery Bonds; Repaying Principal with Added Interest

The third conference of the city's Senate will be held this month, and the issue of reclaiming the racecourse will be hotly discussed again. The council recently learned that a citizen named Leng Qing suggested in his procurement plan for buying back the property rights of the Shanghai Racecourse, vaguely stating: It is appropriate to follow the pre-war aviation lottery method, issuing a lottery bond to purchase the property rights of the Shanghai Racecourse, that is, using its income storage for the needs of purchase, at the beginning of the implementation, the relevant authorities should invite the Jockey Club, the Sports Federation, local impartial people, and land experts, etc. to carefully deliberate on the existing land area of the racecourse and its above-ground buildings, seeking a fair and accurate estimate as a basis, however, this bond its nature should be different from the aviation lottery method, adopting the policy of repaying the principal with added interest. After a certain number of years, it can repay the principal with added interest according to the general bank deposit interest rate. If so, the lottery winners are of course fortunate, and those who do not win also do not lose the guarantee on their investment. In order to be reasonable, the municipal government and local business community people should jointly organize a lottery bond fund management committee to purchase racecourse property rights, responsible for the safekeeping. In addition, six concrete methods are suggested and submitted to the conference for a public resolution.

### After the New Ying Ping Ran Aground, It Sailed to Qingdao and Encountered Danger Again, Was Seriously Damaged and Ran Aground on Bawang Beach, All Passengers and Crew Have Disembarked

The "New Ying Ping" ship of the Tongfu Shipping Line, on the morning of the 8th, loaded over 3,000 tons of materials from the Relief Administration in Shanghai, and sailed to Huludao, Yingkou and other ports. While sailing to the Shandong Peninsula, it hit Erjiao Reef (transliteration). After all the crew members tried to find a way, they attempted to sail back to the nearest location, Qingdao, and urgently sent an "SOS" to seek help from all parties. The Hubei ship passing by the area, as well as US naval vessels from Qingdao and nearby Japanese ships, rushed to rescue. According to the latest telegram: After the ship ran aground, it planned to sail to Qingdao, but due to serious damage to some parts, it ran aground on Bawang Beach near the coast. Most of the passengers and crew have disembarked on the nearby coast. Currently, Tongfu Shipping Line is working with the Shanghai agent of London insurer, Mr. Lao Yi, to contact all parties for assistance.

### Our Merchant Ships Are Poorly Equipped, Drivers Cannot Remain Silent, Hoping the Government Will Improve to Avoid Being Ridiculed by Friendly Nations

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchant Marine Drivers Association hosted reporters at 4 pm yesterday. The chairman of the association, Jin Yueshi, reported that because our country's merchant ships are poorly equipped, the chances of accidents are higher, and the sacrifices after accidents are also heavy. The general public does not understand the truth and often accuses the drivers of not fulfilling their responsibilities, not knowing that the equipment on our country's merchant ships does not meet the standards. For example, a ship carrying 300 people only has life-saving equipment for 100 people. How can there not be a scramble for life when encountering danger, leading to tragedy? Furthermore, many of the passenger ships now are converted from cargo ships. Our country signed the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea in 1922. Recently, the UK invited our country to participate in revising the International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea. If we do not strive to improve, wouldn't we be ridiculed by friendly nations and treat human lives as a joke? We appeal for the following: (1) The Legislative Yuan should formulate regulations on passenger ships as soon as possible. (2) The Control Yuan should impeach the navigation administration agencies that do not meet the standards. (3) Please ask the government to clearly stipulate who has the right to obtain life jackets and board lifeboats first in the event of danger. (4) The government should clearly stipulate the highest standards for domestic life jackets and boats, and their detailed terms. (5) Each time a ship sails, the navigation administration agency should send personnel to inspect the actual conditions of passengers and cargo together with the captain. Finally, we should declare to the society that the crew cannot be held responsible for any consequences arising from non-standard life-saving and fire-fighting equipment. A copy of the British ship life-saving equipment standards was distributed as a reference for our country to formulate standards in the future.

### Murder Case of a Chef in Shanghai Middle School, the Murderer Was Escorted to Shanghai from Anhui

[Report from this newspaper] On the morning of April 8th, at around 6:00 AM, a male corpse was found strangled in the river in front of the Shanghai Middle School gate on Humin Road, South Shanghai. After investigation by the Longhua Police Branch, it was found that the deceased was Li Guojun, a chef from Anhui in the school. At the same time, it was discovered that Lu Shoulu and a Zhao surname, both employees from the same hometown, had fled without a trace. It was believed that they were highly suspected. Details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that Xu, the head of the branch, ordered Lin Deming, the head of the criminal division, to lead police officers to Hefei, Anhui for a two-week investigation. Finally, Lu Shoulu was captured in the Feifengchi Bathhouse in Dongmiao Street. After interrogation, it was confirmed that Lu was the murderer. He was escorted to Shanghai a few days ago and brought to justice. The other Zhao surname is still being pursued.

### A Murder Case Occurred Over a Bowl of Meat

[Report from this newspaper] Yang Chengshan, a 25-year-old Muslim from Shandong, and Xu Jiaoxin, a close friend who studied at the same school in the past, jointly opened the Xiesheng Stationery Store at No. 1903, Duolun Road, North Sichuan Road. Both of them lived in the store. One day during a meal, there was pork in the dishes. Xu persuaded Yang not to follow religious rules and eat meat. Because of this trivial matter, the relationship between the two broke down. Soon Yang withdrew his shares and lived in a warehouse on Lan Road. After Yang left, Xu also regretted it and had no intention of operating alone. He transferred the store to his brother Xu Chengshou, and left Shanghai to work in a bank in Fujian. Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM, Yang passed by the store and saw that the business was very good, which greatly stimulated him. He went directly to the beef stall opposite the store, grabbed a sharp knife, broke into the stationery store, and slashed Xu Chengshou's head, arms, and buttocks five times, causing serious injuries. Lin Guoding, the owner of the Taili Western Clothing Store next door, heard the noise and rushed over, immediately hugged the murderer, and took away the sharp knife. At the same time, the police also arrived. The injured person was immediately sent to the hospital, and the murderer was taken to the police station. After interrogation, the above situation was learned, and he was detained pending transfer to the District Procuratorate for investigation.

### The Administrative Court Is an Independent Institution, and It Is Still Appropriate to Maintain the Original System. Ma Junshuo Explains Five Reasons

[Report from this newspaper] After the implementation of the Constitution and the enactment of the new Judicial Yuan Law, there are various opinions on whether the administrative adjudication agency should be changed, that is, whether the administrative court system should be abolished. The reporter talked with Mr. Ma Junshuo, a famous lawyer in this city, yesterday. He believed that it should not be abolished and that it is still appropriate to maintain the original system. The reasons are as follows:

(1) Administrative litigation is a litigation between the people and government agencies, and its purpose is to sanction illegal actions of government agencies. All government agencies in the country, from local government agencies to the central five yuan, can be defendants in administrative litigation. There should be an independent agency of considerable scale dedicated to handling it. Our country has had administrative adjudication agencies since the Republic of China. If it is abolished after the implementation of the Constitution and merged with ordinary judicial agencies to become a court of the Judicial Yuan, it would lose its original independent and detached position. (2) There is no distinction between administrative law and common law in the United States, so the Supreme Court handles administrative litigation cases concurrently. However, in our country's system, administrative litigation is completely different from civil and criminal litigation. Before filing an administrative lawsuit, administrative reconsideration and further reconsideration procedures must be followed. No lawsuits can be filed with local or high courts. Therefore, if the administrative court is merged with the highest level of ordinary judiciary, it will form a system where the top is combined and the bottom is separated, causing the system to be chaotic and powers to be mixed up. (3) Currently, the administrative court adopts a one-level, one-trial system, while ordinary judicial agencies adopt a three-level, three-trial system. If they are merged, it would be difficult to say that it is appropriate in terms of organization. (4) The current Administrative Court Organization Law stipulates that the Administrative Court is divided into two or three courts, with five judges in each court. When the constitutional era arrives, administrative litigation cases will gradually increase, and there is still a need to expand the organization. If it is abolished, and only one court of the Judicial Yuan is used to handle the administrative litigation cases of the people of the whole country, it may not be possible in reality. (5) To adjudicate administrative litigation cases, it is necessary to have a full understanding of the administrative organization and the implementation of administrative affairs. At the same time, there is no codified administrative law to refer to, and the current administrative laws and regulations are not enough to resolve all administrative disputes. If ordinary judicial officers also serve as administrative adjudication positions, there may also be problems in terms of ability. To sum up, it is still appropriate to maintain the independent institution of the Administrative Court, he said.

### Flight and Weather: Meteorologist Huang Xiaqian Gave a Broadcast Speech Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] This newspaper held the sixth special Sunday broadcast yesterday at the Yuanchang Heming Radio Station, inviting Dr. Huang Xiaqian (pictured), a member of the National Defense Science Committee of the Ministry of National Defense and Director of the Department of Meteorology at the National Central University, to broadcast "Flight and Weather." Excerpts from his speech are as follows:

Last Christmas, three planes crashed in Shanghai, and several other planes crashed afterwards, resulting in significant losses. Even in early spring last year, several planes crashed. Unfortunate aviation events clearly occur more frequently in winter. Everyone is very relieved these days, and aviation can be said to be peaceful. Moreover, not only is it peaceful now, but I can tell you in advance that you can rest assured to take planes for a while. So why are there so many incidents in the aviation industry in winter? I can tell you clearly that this is not what superstitious people call "destiny" or "luck," but due to "weather." With these lessons, we should pay attention to the relationship between weather and flight.

Generally speaking, the weather is worst in winter throughout the year. The reason why the most unfortunate events in the aviation industry occur in winter is because of this. The following are some of the harmful factors of winter weather for flying: (1) The weather is cloudy and rainy, and the cloud layer is very low. Sometimes the bottom of the cloud is connected to the top of the mountain, and the plane crashes into the top of the mountain when it flies out of the cloud layer. General Dai Zhu's death last year was due to this reason. Sometimes the bottom of the cloud is almost connected to the ground. Meteorologists call this "ceiling zero." The plane cannot see the runway in the air and cannot land. When the gasoline runs out, it can only crash. The reason for the crash of the three planes in this city last Christmas was this. (2) There is fog on the ground. Although the weather is sunny above, the ground is shrouded in fog. The plane cannot find the airport and runway in the sky. Either the oil runs out and it crashes, or it collides with the mountains or other obstacles near the airport and crashes. The crash of a plane near Qingdao in January this year was due to this. (3) The temperature in the cloud layer is too low, and the wings of the plane freeze when it passes through it. Losing control, it naturally cannot fly forward and crashes. The cargo plane that crashed on the south bank of Chongqing in February this year was due to this reason.

The above-mentioned low clouds, fog, and frozen clouds are most common in winter. The occurrence of many unfortunate events in the aviation industry in winter has become a natural result. The weather will be clear and warm in the future, so I judge that such events will decrease, which can be called a good time for everyone to take a plane. However, in summer, there are also thunderstorms, which can often lead to plane crashes. Pilots and passengers should be careful. Fortunately, there are meteorological observations and forecasts about the weather conditions in various places and future weather conditions. The airline authorities should organize more meteorological services, and passengers should check whether the airline has weather information. If everyone pays attention to the weather, the unfortunate events in aviation can be reduced.

Broadcast Singing, Many Programs

The sixth Sunday broadcast hosted by this newspaper was held yesterday at the Yuanchang Heming Radio Station. In the morning, Dr. Zhong Zhihe lectured on "The Latest Treatment Methods for Tuberculosis," and Secretary Zhong Xian lectured on "The Story of Our Lady of Lourdes."

### More Than 2,000 Students of Jiaotong University Are Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Today to Petition, and Will Submit Eight Requirements to the Ministry of Education

[Report from this newspaper] The Student Autonomy Association of National Jiaotong University hosted the press yesterday afternoon at the Gongzhuo Hall of the school to report on the reasons and purposes of the strike and petition against the Ministry of Education's decision to suspend the two departments of Navigation and Marine Engineering of Jiaotong University, and called on the society to sympathize. It is said that the Ministry of Education discriminates against Jiaotong University in many ways, such as: (1) Last year, the Railway Management College of Beiping Jiaotong University and the Tangshan Branch were also ordered to separate and become independent from Jiaotong University. (2) Jiaotong University has more than 3,000 students and only more than 400 professors and staff, while Central University, which has a total of more than 5,000 students, has more than 1,300 faculty and staff. (3) Jiaotong University's monthly funding is only 10 million yuan, while its expenses reach 50 million yuan. In addition to the insufficient number of professors and staff salaries, it has to lose 70 million yuan every month. In the past, it was used from the rehabilitation funds, but the rehabilitation funds of more than one billion yuan have also been used up. Other universities in the country, such as Zhejiang University, have received an extra subsidy of 5 billion yuan, and Central University has received 2 billion yuan for faculty and staff's winter clothing. Other national universities also have more funding than Jiaotong University. (4) The Ministry of Education not only does not allow Jiaotong University to continue running the two departments of Marine Engineering and Navigation, but also does not allow the establishment of the two departments of Textile and Water Conservancy. Whether the Chemical Engineering Department can continue to run is still under consideration. However, other universities are ordered to expand, such as Fudan University adding a Fishery Specialist Department, and Tongji University adding a Law School. For the sake of protecting Jiaotong University, the students of Jiaotong University could not bear to see Jiaotong University being destroyed. They have submitted letters and petitions and sent representatives to Nanjing several times, but they have all failed. Therefore, they decided to protest with actions and decided to submit eight requirements to the Ministry of Education: (1) Jiaotong University should live up to its name and become a Jiaotong University. The various colleges and departments of Jiaotong University should not be divided, and the development of Jiaotong University should not be restricted. (2) Marine Engineering and Navigation should not be suspended. (3) Water Conservancy, Textile, and Chemical Engineering must continue to be established. (4) Jiaotong University should not be discriminated against. (5) Request to increase Jiaotong University's funding. (6) Request to increase Jiaotong University's equipment and school buildings. (7) Request to replenish the number of Jiaotong University professors and staff. (8) Request to increase Jiaotong University's public funding and quota. The school protection committee also severely corrected the remarks made by Fang Zhimou, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education, the day before yesterday, and supplemented Dean Wu's written remarks as follows: (1) The Ministry of Education claimed that the two departments of Marine Engineering and Navigation originally belonged to the Chongqing Ship School and should be returned to the original school for management after rehabilitation. The students believe that there is an urgent need for talents, and it is feared that simultaneous training in both schools will not be enough. How can they be reduced instead? (2) Minister Zhu and Director Zhou did express that they intended to specialize Jiaotong University and change it into an engineering school. Colleges and departments that are not engineering-related will be considered for adjustment. The students believe that it is not reasonable to specialize one school of Jiaotong University while expanding other schools. (3) Minister Zhu did express that the name of Jiaotong University was when it belonged to the Ministry of Communications, and it is no longer appropriate now. The Ministry of Education's spokesperson's claim that "there is no such thing at all" is actually going back on his own words. Also, it is reported that more than 2,000 students of Jiaotong University are scheduled to go to Nanjing today (the 12th) to petition and launch a school protection movement. It is claimed that they will never give up until they achieve their goals.

### Improving Education for Overseas Chinese in Siam: Our Ambassador to Siam Proposes Six Demands; Siamese Government's Response Achieves Partial Resolution

[Our Nanjing Dispatch] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, considering that diplomatic relations between China and Siam have been restored, but the Siamese authorities' discrimination against Chinese education has not been thoroughly improved, has sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting it to instruct the Embassy in Siam to negotiate. It has been learned that our Embassy in Siam has proposed: (1) According to the provisions of the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty, overseas Chinese should enjoy the freedom to establish schools to educate their children. Before the issue of Sino-Siamese nationality is resolved, overseas Chinese should be free to choose Chinese or Siamese schools for their children who have reached compulsory education age. (2) The qualifications of principals and teachers of Chinese schools, after being certified by the Chinese Embassy in Siam, can be employed to teach subjects other than Siamese language courses, without the requirement of having a certain level of Siamese proficiency. (3) All Chinese schools that enroll students of compulsory education age should use Siamese to teach Siamese language, Siamese history, and geography. Chinese national language, Chinese history, and geography should be taught in Chinese (Chinese subjects should have at least twelve hours per week). Other subjects may be taught in Siamese or Chinese at will. (4) Chinese textbooks used in Chinese schools that have been reviewed and approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education will be exempt from review. (5) School buildings and equipment that were previously occupied or borrowed by the Siamese authorities after schools in various places were closed down should be returned, and compensation should be paid for any losses. (6) The Siamese government is requested to use a portion of the educational donations paid by overseas Chinese each year as subsidies to reward Chinese schools. The above points have been submitted to the Siamese government for a response, and it is reported that partial resolution has been achieved, with the remainder still under negotiation.

### Mayor Wu Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Decision Made to Improve Rice Rationing; People in Production Areas Have Weakened; Tin Rice Has Fallen Back

Mayor Wu took the night train to Beijing last Friday to attend the National Price Conference, which has been made public. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning.

The improved rice rationing plan may be announced and implemented today.

After Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai, he immediately notified Qu Zhenhua, chairman of the Rice Industry Association, by telephone, instructing him to reassure his colleagues that the municipal government would provide close protection, and that rice grabs and shop attacks would be severely punished. Actions by rice merchants to hoard and speculate will also be severely punished.

In recent days, more and more ships have arrived at the north and south markets, and there have been no obstacles along the way. According to rice merchants, it is very likely that rice prices will fall below 200,000 yuan. However, the rice shops are still refusing to purchase the rationed rice thrown out by the Relief Bureau. It is heard that Mayor Wu has severely warned them about this matter.

According to a report from the Wuxi production area received by the rice market yesterday, tin rice (white rice) has fallen back to 242,500 yuan per stone.

### Rampant Smuggling of Tung Oil in South China; Export Promotion Association Plans to Request Implementation of Measures

The Export Promotion Association recently received a telegram from its Guangzhou office stating that tung oil smuggling is rampant in the area. The Hong Kong government announced that tung oil exports in the first quarter of this year reached over 17,000 tons, while customs reports show that only a few dozen tons of tung oil were exported through Guangzhou during the same period. As a result, prices in foreign markets have fallen from 3.2 cents to 2.8 cents, which has a significant impact on legitimate exporters. Exporters generally resent the authorities' tolerance of smuggling. It is understood that the association is now drafting two proposals for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval and separate implementation: (1) Sichuan has 20,000 tons of tung seeds, which will be transported to Shanghai along the Yangtze River. In the future, Shanghai is still planned to be the largest port for tung oil exports. (2) A Chinese Merchants Import and Export Management Committee will be organized, jointly composed of import and export institutions, customs, and local authorities. Due to the special international relations in the area, the Guangzhou side has decided to independently adopt certain measures before cooperating with the Hong Kong government in anti-smuggling work. The Export Promotion Association will strengthen the work of the Guangzhou office, reward informants, increase security forces, and strictly carry out anti-smuggling activities.

According to a certain authority in the export industry, before the war, England and the United States were the main markets for intestine casing exports from Jiangxi, with an average annual export value of approximately US$12 million, which later decreased to over US$8 million. This intestine casing is used by foreigners not only to make surgical sutures and gut strings but also to make food products, with a very wide range of uses. The northwestern provinces of China all produce intestine casings, with Gansu Province having the largest production. The province can produce an average of about 500,000 pieces per year. Currently, due to the extremely high purchase prices in Shanghai, there is not only no profit to be made, but losses will be incurred. Therefore, intestine casing exports have essentially come to a standstill.

### Mexico Lowers Gold Export Prices

[Reuters, New York, 10th] It was learned today that the Bank of Mexico has lowered its gold export prices by approximately 2 and 1/6 percent since the 9th. The new price for a 50-peso gold coin is approximately US$47.938, which is equivalent to approximately US$39.763 per ounce of pure gold. New York merchants were deeply surprised by this price reduction. Yesterday's reduction in the gold price by the Bank of Mexico was the third price reduction since the beginning of March. During this period, Mexico's asking price has fallen from US$42.92 per ounce to yesterday's US$39.76. It is understood that based on yesterday's asking price of US$47.938, the demand for 50-peso gold coins has rebounded strongly.

### HSBC Shares in Demand

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 10th] Over the past few days, HSBC shares have been in great demand in the stock market. Today's bid price was HK$2,000, and morning trading once reached HK$2,050. According to a well-known broker here, this stock has reached an unprecedented high price. Another authoritative source stated that HSBC shares cannot be purchased on the London market.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Revisions to Tobacco Leaf Management Regulations

The Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Trade Association, because of the difficulties in implementing 4 of the 15 articles of the Tobacco Leaf Management Regulations distributed by the Price and Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, specifically requested the Commodity Tax Bureau to revise four points: (1) To request a change in the items on the original and duplicate receipts (regarding Articles 7 and 8 of the Tobacco Leaf Management Regulations); (2) To request exemption from obtaining permits for separate transportation of tobacco leaves sold locally (Article 10); (3) To request that semi-monthly reports be changed to monthly reports (Article 12); (4) To request that the Bureau should jointly audit accounts with the responsible trade association (Article 14). It is understood that the Commodity Tax Bureau submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry instructed that the opinions of the Tobacco Leaf Association on the proposed revisions to points 1, 2, and 3 are feasible and approved for revision. However, regarding point 4, the audit of accounts, the tax authorities, in order to assess the actual sales and inventory of goods, may inspect the goods and audit the books when necessary, based on the tax rate, and there is no regulation requiring joint handling with the trade association, so the original provision should be maintained and not revised.

In addition, Article 3 of the Regulations clearly states: "Shanghai area tobacco leaf merchants, regardless of Chinese or foreign merchants, should uniformly fill out an application registration form and attach the local competent authority's permit for construction, and request the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau to issue a registration certificate, which will be reported to the tax authorities for record." The association should notify all members to bring their Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau business registration certificates as soon as possible. Those who have not yet been approved should bring a receipt from the Social Affairs Bureau acknowledging their application for registration from their respective businesses to the Bureau to complete registration, in order to comply with the procedures.

The Tobacco Leaf Trade Association believes that the Commodity Tax Bureau will soon implement the Tobacco Leaf Management Regulations, and all member businesses should go to the Bureau to complete registration. However, there are still many members who have not applied for a business registration certificate from the Social Affairs Bureau. The association will notify all members to go to the Social Affairs Bureau as soon as possible to avoid delays.

### From "Disaster Relief First" to "Suppress Bandits First"

— Dispatch from Changsha, May 5th, by Our Correspondent in Tingzhou, Huang Chao Ru

Last year's autumn harvest in Hunan Province was estimated to be 70% of normal. Southern Hunan harvested 70%, and families should have been well-fed. In addition, a large amount of relief supplies were transferred to Hunan Province, so the disaster victims should have recovered. However, the current situation in Hunan is that not only are families not well-fed, but the severity of the disaster is no less than last year.

The most common problem in rural Hunan now is the lack of funds, seeds, and draft cattle. Because the disaster relief work was insufficient during last year's disaster, the only way for disaster victims to survive, besides eating grass roots and tree bark, was to resort to high-interest loans. As a result, everything harvested in the autumn was used to repay the loans, and the situation of having nothing left over was already apparent early on. The relief supplies went into the pockets of a few people, and not only did Hunan's construction not make any progress, but the disaster victims did not receive the benefits of "work-for-relief." Now, the disaster-stricken situation in last year's disaster areas has not diminished.

Grain Shortage; Disaster Difficult to Avoid

Mr. Zhou Lan, a prominent figure in Hunan Province, recently returned to the province from his native Qiyang, Hunan. When talking to visiting reporters about the disaster situation in southern Hunan, he spoke from the perspective of the people and witnessed the current situation in rural southern Hunan. Therefore, his conclusion was, "This year is not as satisfactory as we had hoped, and the disaster in southern Hunan may recur." Yes, the recurrence of the disaster in southern Hunan this year will be an unavoidable fact. If you don't believe it, be careful when the grain is short; the facts will tell us what will happen.

After Chairman Wang shouted the slogan "Disaster Relief First," he followed it up with "Suppress Bandits First." When he shouted the slogan "Suppress Bandits First," Hunan was plagued by frequent bandit alarms. But at that time, the bandits were just small scattered bandits, causing minor disturbances, and were not a major problem. Who knew that after this slogan was shouted, the bandit alarms in Hunan progressed from scattered bandits to organized communist bandits? Currently, the communist bandits are rampaging in the mountainous areas of western Hunan, which have long suffered from communist disasters, causing everyone to turn pale at the mention of bandits. Even the central government is paying attention to this.

Li Xiannian's Troops Return to the Deep Mountains of Western Hunan

The communist army that invaded western Hunan this time is the remnants of Li Xiannian's troops, led by Li Renlin and Wang Dinglie, with about 2,000 people. They crossed the Yangtze River from Xingshan, Hubei, around the Lunar New Year last year. At that time, it was publicized that this group of remnant bandits had been eliminated. Who knew that after a month or two, they suddenly invaded western Hunan from the Hefeng area of Hubei, once reaching Dongting Creek between Yuanling and Taoyuan, preparing to sneak across the Yuan River. After strict prevention, they began to retreat westward. Western Hunan is full of mountains, barren land, and poor people, and the people are fierce. There is a situation where civilians and bandits are indistinguishable. When the communist bandits invaded this area, it was like fierce tigers entering the mountains and dragons getting water. Although the military and militias shout about suppression every day, they have not been able to harm a single hair on their heads, so they come and go freely, as if there is no one there. The number of people has now increased, and there is no mention of any success in the suppression at the moment.

Extinguishing Sparks; Increasing Political Power

A few thousand communist bandits are not worth paying attention to. As long as the government can increase its military power a little, I believe they can be completely resolved. What is worrying is that the invasion of Hunan by Wang and Li's bandits is different from ordinary banditry. As of now, there have been very few reports of harassment in the places they have passed. Their effect is measured, and the political significance outweighs the military significance. In western Hunan, which is both "poor" and "ignorant," after being incited by them, there is indeed some cause for concern. A single spark can start a prairie fire. If it cannot be extinguished early, who can guarantee peace and security on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou? And extinguishing this spark with military force alone seems insufficient; political power should also be increased simultaneously. How to increase political power? Chairman Wang's stable style, when applied to peacetime, especially in Hunan after a long illness, is still suitable for the needs. But to deal with communist bandits, a bold and decisive approach is necessary. As long as the politics are clear and the local area is stable, no matter how much the communist bandits "talk sweet nothings," they will not be able to gain a foothold. If you drive away the sparrows for the sake of the forest or drive away the fish for the sake of the deep water, it would be too bad and too dangerous. Time is the most precious thing. We hope that the Hunan authorities will seize the time and achieve a major victory in suppressing bandits with equal emphasis on politics and military affairs!

### Like a Snake Swallowing an Elephant; Like a Fish Tempted by Bait; Liu Bocheng Invades Northern Henan

— By our reporter Fan Shiqin, dispatch from Zhengzhou, May 5th

After the Yellow River returned to its old course, Liu Bocheng had no way to steal chickens and dogs along the Longhai Railway in eastern Henan, so he ran to the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan to do good deeds. He always couldn't get past this railway. If he couldn't find trouble on the Longhai Railway, he would play tricks on the Pinghan Railway. As a result, the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan was filled with the flames of war, and countless souls cried out in vain.

Liu Bocheng truly has the heart of a snake. He wants to swallow the nearly 500 li of the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan in one gulp. The plan is to do it like this: blow up the Yellow River Railway Bridge, take a long section of the railway from the Yellow River Railway Bridge to Anyang Road into his hands, and then, as soon as he opens his mouth, won't he swallow it all into his stomach? He has tried this in late March and early April, but the result is that an elephant cannot be swallowed by a snake.

Sun Refuses to Surrender; Insists on Defending His City

If he can't swallow it whole, then he can only cut it up and eat it piece by piece. This is what Liu Bocheng is doing with the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan now. Therefore, after his initial defeat near the Yellow River Railway Bridge, he concentrated his forces and changed course to Jixian, the intersection of Qingluo and Pinghan Roads. As a result, he didn't take Jixian, but he took Hongxian, and the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan was cut into two sections by him. After this, he will naturally eat Tangyin first, and then Anyang.

It took Liu Bocheng twenty-seven days to eat Tangyin, which was hard enough for him. Originally, he didn't want to pay any price to eat Tangyin. At first, he thought that Tangyin was surrounded by him, and he could sit back and enjoy the benefits with just a "letter of persuasion to surrender." However, Sun Dianying, the national army soldier defending the city, was also a tough man. After receiving Liu Bocheng's "letter of persuasion to surrender," he wrote a "letter of refusal to surrender" to him, saying in the letter: "If you have the guts, attack your way; if I have the guts, I'll defend my way; if I don't have the guts, I won't defend my city, and if you don't have the guts, you don't need to talk nonsense."

Kite Gambit; A Legendary Story

At this point, Liu Bocheng used a kite trick to distribute leaflets to the city, saying that the city must be very panicked, so it's "better to surrender." Here, I heard a legendary story. It is said that Sun Dianying used a rope to hoist a communist into the city, treated him to a big meal, and even invited him to see a play. Then, he used a rope to hoist him out of the city. At the time of parting, Sun Dianying said to the communist: "Brother, you can see the situation in the city. Go back and report it."

This dramatic story was still spread by Sun Dianying's office, using this story to illustrate the communist army's "persuasion to surrender" and Sun Dianying's "refusal to surrender," which is a truly excellent masterpiece. There are stories of beheading envoys who refuse to surrender in history, but their subtlety is not as good as Sun Dianying's invitation to envoys to refuse to surrender. Sun Dianying issued his will a few hours before the city fell, and there has been no news since. It remains to be seen whether Sun Dianying's character will step down from this era's stage or will step up again, depending on his fate.

Tangyin and Anyang are just the bait on the hook. Liu Bocheng is currently redeploying outside the column, and his purpose is naturally to eat these two pieces of meat. The column's defenders are the famous Li Tietou (Zhenqing). How that martial drama will play out is not worth talking about. Let's get down to business and talk about how Liu Bocheng's gluttony will make millions of people in northern Henan food for his chopping board.

The war situation in northern Henan is obviously that the national army is taking a defensive position. Soon, the national army will definitely change to an offensive position. At that time, it will be the end of the gluttonous Liu Bocheng. Tangyin and Anyang are just bait on a hook. One day, the national army will firmly grasp the fishing rod from the Yellow River Railway Bridge to Xinxiang. At that time, it will be impossible for Liu Bocheng to spit out the bait he swallowed.

The Jinpu Railway is the same. In the overall war situation, the national army is advancing in a straight line, opening up this railway, and uniting the north and south. The communist army is advancing in a horizontal line, destroying this railway, and uniting the east and west. Therefore, the intersection between east, west, north, and south is the place of confrontation. Heaven says: Those who walk in a straight line will prosper, and those who walk in a horizontal line will perish. Heaven also says: Those who gain heaven will survive, and those who defy heaven will perish.

### Amidst the Drums of War, Refugees in Shanxi Province Express Their Feelings

— Dispatch from Taiyuan, May 5th, by our correspondent Zhong Shu

Amidst the extremely tense situation where the sound of war drums is heard throughout Shanxi, I would like to report to the readers about the unprecedentedly tragic events suffered by the people: The Chinese Communists have always boasted of "the people" and "democracy," but in reality, the people not only do not want to accept their "benevolence" and "democracy," but on the contrary, wherever the Communist army arrives, the people flee in fear. People leave their hometowns, abandon their property, and even abandon their children along the way. Their pain is truly beyond imagination. Recently, tens of thousands of people have fled to Taiyuan from various places. The rest are scattered in Xinxian in northern Shanxi, Shouyang in central Shanxi, Jixian, Qixian, Taigu, Linfen in southern Shanxi, Yuncheng, etc., creating a major political burden. (1) People from Mengxian said that they had experienced the Communist Party's ten years of rule. As soon as they expected the national army to arrive, they could easily leave. Now that the national army is withdrawing, they have no choice but to follow the national army westward. Although the county magistrate and military and political leaders have insulted them, there are still tens of thousands of people who have followed the county government westward, and there are even more who have automatically dispersed in all directions. Now, within 20 li around Mengxian City, there is not a single man, woman, or child left. One day, two large carts of old and young men and women were traveling to Ganhe when they unfortunately encountered a unit of the Communist army, who immediately strafed them with machine guns. In an instant, no one, neither people nor animals, survived. (2) People from Zhaocheng said that when the national army withdrew, the able-bodied men in their county first volunteered to follow the army as self-defense forces to assist the national army in combat, and then the old and young also fled to Linfen together. (3) People from Dingxiang said that Duan Longguang, a self-cultivating farmer in Liuhui Village in the county, had his fields confiscated by the Communist army, his houses were distributed to people who followed the Communist army to settle old scores, and he was ordered to demolish them immediately, otherwise they would be set on fire. He was also forced to hand over 150 silver dollars. Duan couldn't come up with the money, so he was hung for two incense sticks (until two incense sticks burned out). Duan was honest and simple and was respected by the villagers. The entire village petitioned, but the Communist Party still refused. In desperation, everyone collected 150 yuan by contributing three or two yuan each, and only then did the matter end, but Duan's hands had already been dislocated.

### Across the Yalu River

— A dispatch from Shenyang by our reporter Zhao Zhan, May 1st

Taking a train from Shenyang to Andong, we departed from the Liaozhong Plain, traveled southeast along the Changbai Mountains, and traversed through majestic mountains and beautiful scenery. In late spring, the weeds and wildflowers, the mountains nurturing water, and the green landscapes, were sure to delight people. The small rivers were slowly rippling with yellow waves.

Shadows of Transportation

On the An-Shen Railway, we enjoyed California's sweet raisins, a small box costing fifty yuan in circulating currency, which could be considered cheap and good.

The city of Andong, located on the banks of the Yalu River, is a prominent point, its food supply relying entirely on shipments from Shenyang, making the An-Shen Railway its lifeline. The An-Shen Railway opened to traffic in January, was interrupted in February, and repaired again in March. During the twenty days of interruption, grain prices doubled. After the resumption of traffic, grain prices dropped slightly, but there was still an upward trend. The future of transportation is not optimistic, and "grain shortage" remains a shadow over the lives of 300,000 citizens.

The An-Shen Railway is 260 kilometers long, and the number of bridges and tunnels is the highest in the Northeast. The longest, the Fujinling Tunnel, is 4,884 feet long. When the National Army entered Andong in December last year, the Communist Army thoroughly destroyed it before retreating. After emergency repairs, the bridges were all made of sleeper frameworks. During the summer flood season, these temporary pontoon bridges would inevitably be washed away. This is the most urgent problem in Andong. However, due to financial and material difficulties, the transportation authorities are helpless to carry out timely repairs.

Political Situation in An-Tung

Andong has a total of fifteen counties and two cities. The National Army recovered eleven counties and two cities, but in March, the Communist Army invaded and occupied five northern counties including Jinchuan. In terms of the recovered areas, only two counties were completely taken over, namely Andong and Zhuanghe. Most of Andong is mountainous, and grain production could originally be self-sufficient, but after the war, it relied entirely on aid from other provinces, which increased the difficulties of the Andong provincial government. Chairman Gao Xibing can be said to be a pro-people official. Recently, he firmly resigned due to his inability to solve the people's suffering, but his resignation was not approved. He himself is an industrial talent, a native of Fengcheng, Andong, 51 years old, a graduate of Lowell Textile University in the United States, and has served as the Director of the Xinjiang Construction Department. He is a big man with a compassionate heart.

Andong is indeed extremely poor. The average farmer does not have two months of food reserves. Under the coercion of the spring famine, spring plowing is hopeless. Spring is a period when farmers transition from hunger to death. During the year and two months that the Communist Army occupied the area, they issued 30 million yuan in "Northeast Promissory Notes," prohibiting the use of other currencies and forcibly stipulating that the exchange rate between circulating currency and Northeast Promissory Notes was two to one. As a result, the wealth of the people was plundered. Chairman Gao said that in his hometown of Fengcheng, seven households cannot find 500 yuan in circulating currency, which shows the extent of the people's poverty. This year, Andong's land tax has been suspended, and the farmers are very grateful for the central government's kindness.

Andong's education recovery has been relatively good. The cultural level of the recovered areas is relatively high. The recovery of middle schools has reached 80% of the original state, with more than 9,600 students. The recovery of national education has reached 60%, with more than 105,000 students. During the Communist Army's occupation, boys and girls attended the same schools. Now, boys' schools and girls' schools are being implemented separately.

Three Major Specialties

Andong, a fertile border area, has long been coveted by the Japanese for its rich products. The Japanese once dreamed of building a beautiful industry here. Andong's most valuable products are wood, tussah silk, and tobacco; the minerals here include coal, iron, gold, copper, and lead, but the quality of the coal is poor. The iron ore is of good quality but the yield is low. The gold reserve is about two metric tons. Soybean oil is also a major product.

In the northern counties of Changbai, Mengjiang, and Fusong, there are still ancient forests that are thousands of years old, dense and lush, blocking out the sunlight, covering an area of about 4 million cubic meters. If fully utilized, there would be no problem in supplementing 200,000 railway sleepers needed each year in the Northeast, and there could be a large amount of timber for export. Currently, it is under the control of the Communist Army, and the source of timber is completely cut off. The reporter visited the Andong branch of the Northeast Production Administration's lumber mill. The factory was originally the Pseudo-Manchukuo Mudanjiang Timber Industry Co., Ltd., jointly founded by the Kwantung Army and the Pseudo-Manchukuo Ministry of Industry. It could build large wooden ships with a load of 300 tons and was very large in scale. The Production Administration took over the materials of this factory to maintain the lives of more than 300 old and weak workers. Eighty percent of the factory was destroyed by the Communist Army. Now, there are only over a hundred unfinished ship frames, lying in the factory like fish bones.

Tussah silk is a type of silk that grows on tussah trees. Andong's production accounts for 70% of the country's production and 50% of the world's production. The tussah silk industry was not developed in the Pseudo-Manchukuo era. The intention was that the Japanese were afraid of resisting the sales of Japanese silk. The Japanese destroyed one-third of the tussah trees. Mr. Li Youshan, Director of the Andong Construction Department, said: "We can restore one-sixth this year, and we hope to restore all of them next year." The reporter visited the Minsheng Processing Factory No. 1 of the Andong Provincial Government, which produces tussah silk. The factory was originally founded by the Japanese Nishihara Fuji Gas Company in the seventh year of the Republic of China and was one of the two major tussah silk factories in the Far East (the other being in Tokyo), with a capital of 10 million yuan. It originally had 9,500 spindles, producing 45,000 catties of tussah silk per month; now it has 2,000 spindles, producing 10,000 catties of tussah silk per month, and the products are transported and sold to Shanghai.

Tobacco is a promising product, produced in Xiuyan and Fengcheng, with a quality comparable to Guizhou tobacco. Fengcheng's monthly tobacco tax is 100 million yuan. I visited the paper mill taken over by the Committee (Note: this is Zhao Zhan, this reporter), and they were all dilapidated and difficult to resume work.

The Yalu River is under strict blockade, truly "white waves flowing in vain, no shadows of sails." On the opposite bank is Sinuiju, North Korea, and the 3,098-foot-long Yalu River iron bridge is closed off by a silk net. Climbing Zhenjiang Mountain, a famous scenic spot in Andong, a panoramic view of the great river is in sight, arousing emotions! Regarding the issue of navigation on the Yalu River, our side is negotiating with the Soviet army, and navigation is expected to resume soon. Before the September 18th Incident, the police power of the Yalu River was entirely in our hands. Now the situation is different. If anyone dares to boldly sail on the river, the Soviet army will shoot, thus causing suffering to our fishermen and North Korean fishermen, whose livelihoods have lost their guarantee. It also blocks the outlet of timber from the upper reaches of the Yalu River.

The government attaches great importance to the issue of water police. The Andong Water Police Bureau has been established, and water police are being trained. Forest police are also being prepared for training.

### Art and Craftsmanship on the Rise: International Offset Color Printing Exhibition

— A dispatch from Leiden on the 2nd

The International Offset Printing Exhibition recently held at the Gemeente Musea in The Hague has a banner with the words "Als de steenen spreken" (If the stones could speak). The venue displays lithographic printing presses and a huge stone, 1.2 meters high and 84 centimeters wide, to show that the world's latest web offset color printing originated from the old-fashioned lithography, but is more exquisite and magical than lithographic prints.

Full Range on Display, Including Products from the UK, USA, and USSR

Lithography is gradually being eliminated in the European market, and it is being replaced by offset rubber plates. The zinc plates commonly seen in Shanghai, China, if not printed on paper plates, with a 2.2 cm thick base plate nailed under the zinc sheet, can only be flat printed, and the printing speed is not high. Now, the zinc plate used for offset printing with fine patterns is a large zinc plate as thick as tinplate, a whole sheet measuring 1.4 meters long and 1.1 meters wide. If the image is 16 cm long and 11 cm wide, each whole zinc plate can accommodate 40 images for simultaneous printing. For color printing, the standard is usually up to six colors. The image to be printed is divided into six large plates, and printed six times. The maximum limit is 12 colors, which requires dividing the image into twelve plates, each printed with one color. When printing, the zinc plate with the front image is fixed on the roller of the web press and dyed with a color of ink, which is transferred to the rubber plate on another roller to form a reverse image, which is then transferred to the paper to be printed, resulting in a front image. The printing speed is very high. By using the rubber plate to gradually transfer the different colors of ink onto the paper surface, no matter how rough the paper is, it can easily penetrate and appear clearly. If it is a color photograph, it is even easier to rely on offset rubber printing to see the true beauty of nature. In terms of printed matter from European countries, from valuable ancient paintings and illustrations in books to cheap can labels, and even advertisements and toys, all other printing methods have been abolished and replaced by offset rubber printing. The more copies printed, the cheaper it becomes. Color printing requires at least 50,000 or 100,000 copies, otherwise it is too uneconomical. The exhibits in this exhibition, in addition to those made in the Netherlands, include those from the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, and other countries.

Ten Categories: Old Books, Famous Paintings, Calendars

In short, there are ten categories: (1) Calendars. (2) Attractive travel brochures for land, sea, and air travel, usually 22 cm long and 11 cm wide. (3) Various advertising posters, vertical ones 95 cm high and 62 cm wide, with an illustration of the exhibition hall's general layout. (4) Wall posters that are changed periodically in theaters and cinemas. (5) Offset rubber plate reproductions of ancient paintings and famous paintings. (6) Advertisements or wrapping paper for fruits and vegetables that are enlarged and finely printed from films made by three-color cameras. (7) Direct color printing on various cans. (8) Tea, coffee, or chocolate candy packet paper. (9) Children's toys printed on thick cardboard to prevent damage. (10) Illustrated label collections that enlighten children's scientific knowledge. Each finely printed color label is about 6 cm high and 4 cm wide. This is a special type of entertainment that Chinese children cannot easily enjoy. It is a wonderful advertisement from large companies in developed countries serving the public, a step further than the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin" character cigarette cards from British and American tobacco companies. Generally speaking, Western children like to eat chocolate candy, and each package contains a label, on which flowers and birds are printed. Collecting them for a long time can complete the whole set. The original factory prints and gives away a detailed explanation of hundreds of flowers and hundreds of islands every year, providing about 200 labels for pasting. Having one in hand is like reading a specialized book, which not only nourishes the mind but also improves knowledge.

Wolf's Model Attracts the Most Attention

The most eye-catching item in the entire venue is the model of the photographic plate-making process created by M.J. Wolf of Paris, France. It is divided into four rooms: the washing and drying department after photographic fixing, progressing step by step, and using white, yellow, and black colors to show the high and low light levels in each room. The institutions and groups participating in the exhibition and competition include photographers, graphic artists, plate-making departments, typesetting foundries, paper wholesalers, poster printing companies, packaging can factories, printing houses, publishing departments, advertising companies, city museums, etc., which shows the flourishing of new social undertakings in the West.

Please Repair the Decayed Wires Quickly

The wires in Wenxianli, Lane 170, Fuxing Middle Road, have been in disrepair for many years. The rubber outside the wires has fallen off. Touching the cement wall on rainy days causes a slight numbness, which is probably due to leakage. Most of the houses in this lane are old, and there is a danger of fire at any time due to electrical leakage. Therefore, please ask the electric company to send someone to inspect and repair it as soon as possible to prevent fires and ensure the safety of the people. Please also inform us of the address of the electric company so that we can directly request it. (Resident of Wenxianli) Editor's note: The Shanghai Electric Power Company is located at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road. Please contact them.

The Lights in Jixiang Lane are Dim

Editor:

I live in Jixiang Lane, Doushi Street, Nanshi. The lights in the lane are dim and people cannot see each other's faces, especially at the entrance of the lane, where it is even darker. Pedestrians often bump into each other. However, the area near the main road is as bright as a picture (because it is a newly built shanty town connected to street lights). Please ask the China Merchants Electric Company to change the connection as soon as possible so that the residents of the lane can regain their light and be endlessly grateful.

Spring and Autumn

### Postscript to "Lucky Grass of Dan'an"

— Gu Yiqiao

Mr. Wang Ciqing of Liangxi having already published his "Plum Villa Collection," widely circulated and praised, someone asked me, "Mr. Ciqing's elder brother, Mr. Fuqiao, was known in his time for his talent and unrestrained spirit. Are his poems and essays available to be read?" I replied in the affirmative: "Have you ever read the sixty-year self-preface of the Qingniu Daoist? The preface says,

'I collected the poems I wrote from youth to old age, deleted nine out of ten, and kept them as old drafts, only for my own enjoyment.'"

Thus, the remaining works are originally less than one-tenth of the total. Moreover, Mr. Fuqiao returned to the Daoist mountains in the year of Yi Mao, enjoying a life of seventy-five years. During those fifteen years, who knows how much more was discarded? Now, seven years have passed since Mr. Fuqiao's death, experiencing great changes. Who knows how much of the surviving drafts remain after the calamities? Therefore, the publication of "Lucky Grass of Dan'an" should not be delayed.

Mr. Fuqiao once wrote a five-character律詩 (regulated verse) for the "Plum Village Collection." When Yang Lingzhou, Uncle-Consort, read the line "High fame mistakenly led to white hair," he clapped the table and exclaimed in admiration, immediately requesting a matching verse for his own fiftieth birthday poem. Now, examining the surviving drafts, the lingering echoes still remain. Is this not fortunate?

"The elegant demeanor of the Director of the Imperial College has ceased, how many autumns have the remaining volumes weathered? The old men of the Guanshan region weep, the abandoned palace is filled with sorrow for the millet and sorghum. The writing is straight, pursuing the green history, high fame mistakenly leads to white hair. The desolate Yu Kai-fu lies ill, remembering the southern state." The self-preface also says:

"Mr. Wu Yannong and I are bound by a friendship that transcends life and death. He praised my poems as being between Loujiang and Xincheng, this is one true friend. Mr. Hou Xiangqian praised my 'Wandering in Aiyuan' lyrics, saying, 'The rhythm is short, and the rhyme is long, resembling Zhu Zhutuo's 'Selling Flowers' lyrics on Yuhuatai,' this is one true friend. Mr. Hua Ruoxi met me in the capital, calling me 'Poet Fu.' When we parted at Maple Bridge, he earnestly promised to meet again later, this is one true friend. Mr. Yang Fanfu appreciated my mountain travel poems, especially the line, 'If you are tired of night travel, lend me a stone bed and cloud,'...this is one true friend... Mr. Du Zihui saw my Five Ancient Verses titled 'Dragon Pool Delivering Rice Picture,' and praised it for its rigorous form and not being unworthy of a master, this is one true friend. Mr. Tao Duanyi regarded me as a pine and cypress in the cold winter, this is also one true friend."

Alas! The "Wandering in the Amusement Park" lyrics, the mountain travel poems, and the "Dragon Pool Delivering Rice Picture," all these works have now been scattered and lost. Heaven has taken away this culture, is it not a pity!

Mr. Fuqiao's given name was Jingrong, his courtesy name was Fubo, and another courtesy name was Shaoquan. He was born on the winter solstice day, the sixth day of the eleventh month of the year Ding Chou, during the Ugly hour (1-3 AM), in the official residence of Xinzhou. Therefore, he called himself Qian Seng, and later called himself Erquan, Danweng, Old Man Fubai, and was also known as Qingniu Daoist. His grandfather, En Huan, whose courtesy name was Leshan, also named Peilun, was dispatched to Hubei as a county magistrate. When he arrived in Wuchang, the city was already surrounded, so he led his son Xie, along with family members Ding Gui and Wu Fushou, and rappelled down the city wall to enter. When the city fell, he died in street fighting. The matter was reported to the emperor, who posthumously named him Wumin, established a dedicated ancestral hall, granted sacrificial rites and burial, and bestowed a hereditary title of Yunqiyu and a biography in the Hanlin Academy. He was married to Madam Yang, the daughter of National Student Suizhang. Her father, Tingzhen, whose courtesy name was Ziquan, also named Ganchen, was a Supplementary Tribute Student on the Shun Tian list in the year Xianfeng Yi Mao, also inheriting the Yunqiyu title, and was appointed as the Prefect of Shinan Prefecture and Wuchang Prefecture in Hubei, gaining a reputation for his administration, and was enshrined in the Temple of Famous Officials. He was also married to Madam Li, the daughter of Zhongqian Gong, a Juren (recommended man) of Ren Wu, who died in the line of duty in Conghua County, Guangdong, and was posthumously named Ganglie. In the year Tongzhi Xin Wei, the tenth year, Mr. Fuqiao was only seven years old. He was bedridden on a boat in Jingli. Two years later, he began to take refuge at the Yellow Crane Tower. In the year Guangxu Ding Chou, at the age of thirteen, he followed Prefect Ziquan to his post in Shinan Prefecture, where he began to write. On his birthday in the year Ji Mao, he composed the lyrics to "East Wind First Branch":

"In the past, I encountered the sun's birth. (My birthday happens to be on the winter solstice) Now I meet the snowy sky. It has been fifteen years. To be considered still young at night, today is no longer childish. Time flies, reading under the curtain, please start from now on. You must surround the stove, melting and casting poetry and books, roasting and studying history." (Half)

In the year Ren Wu, at the age of eighteen, Huang Zongshi Tifang, a student of the Wuxi County School, was selected as the top Xiang student in the prefecture. He was appreciated by Teacher Wang Han of Xuyi, and was added as an increase student after passing the annual examination at a higher level. He was appreciated by Teacher Wang Yiwu of Xiangze, who also published the "Six Xiangzhong Lyricists." Afterwards, he repeatedly took the imperial examinations in the north and south, but failed five times. He once wrote a poem:

"How can I have a Cheng Lian's three-foot zither? I dare not say there are few who understand my music in the world! I only follow the intentions of my teachers, not to comfort my parents' expectations!" In the year Gui Wei, Prefect Ziquan was transferred to Wuchang Prefecture. In the year Bing Xu, in the third month of spring, he resigned from his post and returned to his hometown. He married the eldest daughter of Yang Zuozhou, the county instructor of Liyang, a fellow townsperson. In the eighth month, Prefect Ziquan succumbed to a serious illness and passed away at the young age of fifty-one. At that time, Mr. Fuqiao was twenty-two years old, and Mr. Ciqing was only eighteen! They strictly followed the ancient rituals, their grief exceeding the norm, weeping continuously for a hundred days, and not eating meat for a hundred days. The villagers all praised their filial piety, but Mr. Fuqiao and his brother still felt it was not enough. In the year Wu Zi, people from Shinan who were going to take the autumn examination requested that Prefect Ziquan be enshrined in the Temple of Famous Officials. Mr. Fuqiao then traveled to Chu, writing "Traveling at Night" lyrics, using the rhyme of "Why do the clouds lightly scatter":

"Dream of home scatters in an instant. So desolate, I wake up and still see the bright moon and twinkling stars. Separated by a long, long river, not to mention the countless sounds of autumn. Looking back, the clouds over Henggao are broken. I remember sitting and sleeping, leaning on my pillow for a long time, gradually the Jade Rope is low in the Silver River. Darkly changing the green of my temples. In the year Geng Yin, he traveled with his brother-in-law, Mr. Yang Weiyun, to the Ren Cao Hermitage, visiting the ruins of Guanhua Pavilion, and composed a Five Ancient Verses using the rhyme of the Xu Shu Ting Ji (Exposing Books Pavilion Collection) climbing Xushan:

"Liang Fen once sat here at night, his heart filled with a hundred emotions; Though his ambition was strong, he could only write in vain after climbing high. Buying wine to dispel poverty and sorrow, he relied on a close friend; Life after life, green is pre-destined, friendship is admired since ancient times; Leaving a shadow in the empty hall, a manifestation of Vimalakirti. ... We climbed again, still leaning on the dangerous railing, two hundred years of elegance, the hills and valleys collapsed in an instant; Only the ruins of the abandoned pavilion remain, the name Guanhua unchanged; A guest described his travels, surpassing Heng in the south and constant in the north; Hometown is just a short distance away, yet I laugh at my lack of experience. ..."

In the year Gui Si, his mother, Madam Li, passed away. Mr. Fuqiao buried Prefect Ziquan and Madam Li at Ma'anwu in Huishan, and wrote a biography:

"I only hope that every word is based on fact, not daring to falsely praise my parents or slander them. It is up to the gentlemen who write in this era to examine it."

Ziquan was granted the posthumous title of Duke Wumin for dying in the line of duty in Wuchang. Madam Li was the second daughter of Duke Ganglie, who died in the line of duty in Conghua, a fellow townsperson. Her nature was inherently respectful and compliant, and she served Madam Hu Tai, the concubine, from a young age. In the autumn of Jia Yin, when Duke Ganglie died in the line of duty in Guangdong, amid her grief, she took care of her mother and stepmother, acting in accordance with propriety. She did not prolong the mourning with Buddhist monks, following the instructions of Duke Ganglie! In the year Gui Hai, at the age of twenty-nine, she came to return to Prefect Ziquan. Two years later, in the year Yi Chou, Fuqiao was born; two years later, in the year Ding Mao, his eldest daughter, Qingfen, was born, who later married into the Chen family of Chengjiang. Two years later, in the year Ji Si, Mr. Ciqing was born; two years later, in the year Xin Wei, his second daughter, Huifen, was born, who later married into the Feng family of Kunling. Madam Tai had always been frugal in clothing and food, never wasting a single coin or piece of silk. If she was presented with light, warm, sweet, and crispy items, she would distribute them to the elderly and young. Her younger brother, Mr. Li Yuyan, was a famous teacher in the county, and my father and uncles all studied under him. Her younger sister married into the Tang family of Xizhang, and died early without children. She provided for them without interruption, treating her step-nephew as her own nephew.

In the year Guangxu Jia Chen, the thirtieth year, Mr. Fuqiao revisited Ren Cao Hermitage, recording it in a poem:

"Ten years ago, I swept the moss here, bringing my son again today: The old Guanhua Pavilion, where is it? Where is the jade green in the middle of the sky? Birds peck at the green and red mountain fruits, the monk says the yellow and white chrysanthemums bloom. I heard that Tiger Hill can be seen in the distance, I will turn my head back step by step down the mountain."

At this time, Mr. Fuqiao's eldest son, Zugeng, was nine years old, his second son, Zucong, was six years old, and his eldest daughter, Minfang, was four years old. The following year, Yi Si, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, Mr. Fuqiao took his children boating on Huilu, and wrote a Five Ancient Verses to record the trip:

"This year, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, the sun is warm and the wind is clear, I call my children to eat breakfast and order a boat to leave the north city; Slowly reaching Jiangjian, Huangbu suddenly appears bright; Passing the bridge, I recognize the characters on the pillar, counting the melon sheds through the trees; Looking up at the changing white clouds, looking down at the green water level; One oar changes one scene, discussing and commenting with my children; Before I know it, the Bi Shan mountain appears, already seen in front of me; How soaring are the Nine Dragons? The pagoda rises above the clouds, docking the boat at the foot of Dragon Mountain, the mountain laughs as if welcoming me. ..."

In the year Xuantong Ji You, the first year, he wrote "A Record of the Third Visit to Ren Cao Hermitage," sighing and saying:

"When I brought my son Zugeng to this hermitage for the third time in the first year of Xuantong, the so-called 'jade green in the middle of the sky' had been almost completely cleared away; the halls and buildings were no longer the same as before, making me sigh even more! If Mr. Liang Fen and Rong Ruo have spirits, someone will surely advocate elegance and rebuild this pavilion! I will wait and see."

Sixteen years later, in the year Yi Chou, his brother-in-law Yang Shouzhan Weiyun rebuilt Guanhua Pavilion, setting up a shrine to Liang Fen and Rong Ruo, as well as local sages; Fan Fanshan once wrote a fu (prose-poem) to celebrate it.

In the year Xuantong Xin Hai, the third year, Mr. Fuqiao's third son, Zuxiu, was six years old. He was born with a beautiful appearance, his eyebrows and eyes like a painting. After four years, he contracted a serious illness, lingering in bed for more than a year, and finally passed away, causing endless grief! His farewell verse for his son went:

"Alas, my son's life is entrusted to the dust, there is no way to save him, my face is full of tears; I will take cinnabar as a mark on his arm, may he come to my house again in the next life!" In the summer of that year, the Wang clan genealogy was revised. My maternal grandfather, Jin Cheng Gong, and my two maternal uncles, Fu Bo and Ci Qing, were in charge of the matter, not collecting Ding donations. My maternal grandfather contributed twenty-three yuan, and my two maternal uncles, Fu Bo and Ci Qing, each contributed fifteen yuan.

In the year Minguo Yi Mao, the fourth year, he obtained the calligraphy scroll of his grandfather Duke Wumin, seventy-one years before. He wrote an invitation for poetry:

"Jingrong indulged in seclusion in his early years and took refuge in Zen in his middle age, with his grandfather's style. He was ashamed of Liang Gong's descendants, striving for ambition, and embarrassed by Fubo's grandson, fearing the legacy of both generations. Suddenly, he re-examined his grandfather's old traces. Burning incense to appreciate it, he did not tire of doing it a hundred times, tracing and admiring it, almost ten thousand times. He felt that the structure was rigorous and the spirit was secluded. In the year Jia Chen, during the Dragon Boat Festival, the Stone Spring washed the inkstone, and the fragrance remained on the corner seal. The wild water entered the pond, and he hand-copied the sentence 'Still in his infancy'. From the moment it touched the paper to the signature, there was no deviation, no slackness. It should be treasured forever, how can it be accidental?..."

The following year, Bing Chen, he obtained the calligraphy scroll of his father Duke Minghuan, thirty-six years before. He wrote an invitation for poetry:

"Heaven is too cruel, taking my father away in his prime; Things have their destination, grieving over the relics on the day of return. The sharp edges and corners, the brush rushes like dragons and snakes, the formation is vertical and horizontal, the wrist is like a wind and rain; obtaining the essence of Mi Dian, inheriting the true transmission of Xi Xian. Many beautiful Ci words, the lingering fragrance of twenty-eight sounds has not faded, from Geng Chen to the present, the ink has been new for thirty-six years. Heaven and earth protect and preserve it for a long time, it is unique in the family history, it is the old servant's collection of the Three Buddha Pavilion in Chu, and the supplementary ink of the Yue Ting inscription in Shizhou. ..."

In the seventh year of the Republic of China, there was a Wu Wu draft, in the eighth year, there was a Ji Wei draft, and in the ninth year, there was a Geng Shen draft, all of which have been printed. The Xin You draft and Ren Xu draft are planned to be compiled but not printed. What remains now is "Mountain Travel Showing Cong Er" in Xin You, which has seven ancient styles:

"This year, I have not worn mountain climbing shoes, it is not bad to travel on this day! Chrysanthemums are thin, crabs are fat, new wine is delicious, put it off for another month to make the Double Ninth Festival. ..."

Also, he remembers visiting Ren Cao Hermitage in the rain in the past, using the old rhyme of Jia Chen:

"I used to come to Cao An in the past, suddenly tidying up the cliff, there is no dust; Birds peck at the green and red mountain fruits, the monk says the yellow and white chrysanthemums bloom; The leaky thatched roof is not afraid of thirst, the chestnut garden has a good harvest to warm myself. Pointing to Tiger Hill in the misty rain, I turn my head back step by step down the peak."

In the year Jia Zi, the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he wrote the "Sixty-Year Self-Preface of the Qingniu Daoist," and also wrote four seven-character律詩 (regulated verse) for his own birthday, the first of which said:

"The winter solstice is when the sun is born, I was born then, I dare to say I was blessed by nature! My illnesses often burdened my parents, and my lack of talent is not enough to navigate the world; My father worried during my capping ceremony, and my mother died this year, listening to the sad wind; I pity myself for being lonely and thinking about Yi's teachings, I am ashamed to inherit the past and carry on the future!"

In that year, his eldest sister, Qingfen, died at the age of fifty-eight. Qingfen married Chen Jun of Jiangyin Yijin. After the marriage, she went north to visit her parents-in-law. When she arrived in Yangliuqing, her husband fell ill and died during the journey, she was so saddened that she wanted to die. When she arrived in Beijing, her parents-in-law encouraged her to keep her chastity and adopt a son for her husband. For thirty-six years of hardship, she was fortunate to have her brothers Fu Bo and Ci Qing, their deep family affection was comforting!

In the year Geng Wu, Madam Yang's middle sister, Huanfen, turned sixty. Huanfen married Zhang Yun of Jiangyin, who wrote "Shao Xuan Poetry Collection". Huanfen's matching works included "Remembering Rong Studio Poetry Draft". Two years later, in the year Ren Shen, her third sister Yunfen turned sixty. Mr. Fuqiao wrote a sentence on behalf of the young Madam Pei to congratulate her, saying:

"Setting up a towel is a good time to enjoy the wine, the sisters are separated by Yan Tai; Since we parted, we have been suffering from lovesickness, wanting to reach out and shake hands."

"My sister will be seventy next year, I am happy to see her old and healthy and up to date; I know that the Lai Cai dance is continuous, I envy the heavenly joy of family." At that time, Mr. Fuqiao was sixty-eight years old, and Madam Yang was sixty-seven years old. Liang and Meng were side by side, both near the ancient age of seventy, which was enough to envy the world. Later, Mr. Fuqiao lived to be seventy-five years old, and Madam Yang lived to be seventy-seven years old, living a peaceful and old age, which can be called a fairy couple!

In the year Xin Wei, for the fiftieth anniversary of my late father's death, Mr. Fuqiao wrote:

"Alas! How many years has my brother-in-law Huinong been dead? I still remember my seventh uncle once said to me: 'Huinong has always been enthusiastic about his work and generous in helping others. His deeds cannot be buried. Why don't you write a biography for him to tell his story?' Can I promise? ... Huinong is my sister Qing, and even more so with a marriage connection, how can I not say a word to fulfill my sister Songfen's trust?..."

Gaisheng gave his beloved daughter to my eldest brother Yuqi in marriage, so he was also a relative of my father. The meaning of the writing was not fully expressed, so I ended with a seven-ancient chapter:

"The Hu Tou Men's fortune is now thriving, he should not have died so quickly, my Huinong; The garden is full of jade and the steps are full of orchids, suddenly losing shelter, I grieve for the frosty wind! ... How virtuous is my sister, stopping her tears and rising, I dare not shirk the heavy burden of a thousand catties? I must make sure that the inheritance of one family is continuous, though he is dead in the sky, it is as if he is not dead!..."

Alas! My late father died at the young age of thirty-five. My brothers and I are incapable, and we want to rely on Mr. Fuqiao's poems and essays to pass on to the world. Mr. Fuqiao's nature is calm and indifferent, and he has experienced great changes. Although he is over seventy years old, he still does not want to use poetry and essays to live in the world. Now, my brother and sister-in-law have asked me to organize the surviving drafts and arrange them in chronological order. After thirty years of an orphan's blood and tears, I can finally rely on the poems and essays of the elder to make the Huai Chun Pavilion stand tall under the three lights (sun, moon, and stars), then my father will not be dead! This is also my mother's wish. How dare I not record it with tears.

Respectfully written by Gu Yuxiu of Shenxi Xishan, in the spring of the first Ding Hai year of the Republic of China.

### Scenery (Oil Painting)

— Tang Yunyu

### Visiting Mi Fu's Tomb at Helin Temple

— Shi Chongpeng

Among the landscapes of Jingkou, Jinshan, Jiaoshan, and Beigushan are the most famous. The author visited them twice last autumn and recorded several poems and paintings to ask for guidance from Mr. Ni Zhuhua, my fellow artist. Mr. Ni said that the Bamboo Forest Temple and Helin Temple in the southern suburbs of Zhenjiang have secluded rock sounds and lush trees, which are different from the three mountains; and there is the tomb of Mi Fu Nanggong of the Northern Song Dynasty, which can be used to commemorate. I yearned for it. At the end of last month, after visiting Suzhou, I transferred to Jingjiang and made a half-day trip in a hurry.

Bamboo Forest and Helin are far away from the river. Without climbing high, there is no way to appreciate the beauty of the Yangtze River. This is why the Bamboo Forest Temple has the "Yijiang Pavilion". The Jingkou Landscape Records states: The Mi Fu Temple is on the left of Helin Temple. Today, I came here with Mr. Zhu to explore. The temple has collapsed and there is no trace. I only saw a pile of yellow earth, the artist's resting place. The stele is still there. Examining its text, it records the beginning and end of the repair of the tomb by Lian Guoshi Ji Mi Wanzhong in the Ming Dynasty. Mi Yuanzhang loved the landscapes of Jingjiang so much that he chose to live here when he was alive and was buried here after he died. The inscriptions on the stele are from Chen Jiru Meigong's handwriting, which is especially precious. I and Mr. Zhu lingered under it, unable to bear to leave. I imagined Nanggong's obsession with mountains, and it is appropriate that his paintings were excellent, the crown of the Northern Song Dynasty. His person and his affairs can be called a good story in the art world for thousands of years.

Nanggong's calligraphy is one of the four great masters of the Song Dynasty, the so-called Su, Huang, Mi, and Cai. Nanggong has a unique charm of dragons flying and phoenixes dancing. His paintings are misty and ethereal, forming a unique style, which is regarded as the master of an era. However, not many of his works have been handed down, especially landscapes. According to the "Picture Witness Records", "Zhi Ji", "Xuanhe Painting Spectrum" and other painting histories, there are only a few works such as "Haiyu Temple Picture", "Small Landscape", and "Yuande Empress's Lost Shoe Circle", in which the trees are shaded, the layers are clear, and the figures, pavilions, houses, bridges, fishing boats, etc. are extremely delicate. I am afraid that they are no longer in the world. I have seen the authentic Nanggong "Spring Mountain Rui Pine Picture" collected by the Palace Museum. It is a colored paper, about one foot and two inches high and one foot and six inches wide. The pines are graceful, with varying shades of color. There is a grass pavilion under the pine. The brushwork of the whole picture is extremely simple and ancient. The distant peaks are divided into main and subordinate, the moss is dotted with Mi points, the clouds are filled with clouds, the artistic conception is rich and thick, and a little light red is applied, with green, calm and powerful, which is completely different from those who use thick brush and wet ink to imitate Mi in later generations.

However, Yuanzhang loved to make ink plays. He did not use a brush exclusively for painting, or used paper tendons, or used sugarcane dregs, or used lotus houses, and waved them at will without any restraint. The paper did not use sizing alum, and he did not use a brush on silk. Therefore, his excitement came with the pen, and the artistic conception was full. Drawing on raw paper is easy to collect the interest of ink halo changes. It can be seen that Yuanzhang's ink play is not as woven as "Haiyue Temple Picture", etc., and the imitation of later generations is all here and not there.

Yuanzhang's paintings were passed down by his son Youhong Huer, who was known as Xiao Mi in the world. He decorated the clouds and mist, kept the family law and was able to maintain his innocence. Among the Yuan people after him, Gao Kegong Fangshan specialized in learning Yuanzhang, and his achievements were so exquisite that he was unparalleled for a time. Fang Congyi Fangzhi, a Taoist, devoted himself to the two Mi, and was unrestrained and refined, entering the realm of extraordinary. Chen Baiyang's landscape paintings in the Ming Dynasty also participated in the Mi family method. Although Dong Siweng did not specialize in learning the two Mi, he had a lot of Nanggong's breath, using Shixiu Runwen Jie, becoming a late Ming Dynasty Jijiu. After the Qing Dynasty, there were no lack of Mi students, all of whom lost their horizontal and vertical lines. The Mi school of landscape painting has almost become a lingering sound in Guangling!

Writer Anecdotes

### Chesterton

— Zhongqi

The British writer G. K. Chesterton was chatting with a few friends one evening when they asked each other what kind of books they would like to have with them if they were left on a desert island.

"The Complete Works of Shakespeare," one writer said without hesitation.

"I choose the Bible," another inserted.

"What about you?" someone asked Chesterton.

"I would choose..." Chesterton replied, "The Shipbuilding Guide by Tom Si."

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 506

— Ye Jingfeng

When Tsurumi saw this uninvited guest, he was smiling and standing in the middle of the room. But he had never seen this stranger before, and he couldn't help but be stunned. Especially surprising to him was that no one in Shanghai knew he was Tsurumi except for a few friends who had come to visit. Moreover, the visitor used the Japanese pronunciation "猪玀米" for the name "Tsurumi". And this pronunciation, if said in the Shanghai dialect by a Northerner, would have some deliberately playful meaning. Although Tsurumi was stunned at the time, he understood this playful meaning; because when they were young, when the author was in Japanese elementary school, the author had told him the Shanghai pronunciation and meaning of his name, and often shouted out this tone to joke with him.

Tsurumi should have been a little angry at this visitor for making fun of him like this, whether intentional or unintentional; but he couldn't bring himself to be angry: What was the reason? Because at first glance, her voice was sweet and crisp, and she herself looked just as sweet and crisp; her cheeks were like two small apples, and her round big eyes fully revealed the girl's coquettishness; she wore two small braids, one hanging behind, and the other stubbornly supporting itself in front, which made her even more mischievous. In Tsurumi's eyes, she was probably only sixteen years old or so.

Just under this brief glimpse, the scene of his first meeting with Ji Yaoqun five or six years ago suddenly touched Tsurumi's mind. In other words, the small shadow of this girl in front of him and Ji Yaoqun five or six years ago were exactly the same: both were healthy and beautiful, both were lively, both were innocent. The only difference was that Yaoqun showed a full of depression in his demeanor under the evil forces of the Japanese invaders in the Northeast, while this girl had a face full of giggling and mischief.

"Oh!..." At this time, Tsurumi's emotions were probably a mixture of surprise, doubt, astonishment, bizarreness, plus a trace of curiosity, and a little bit of wishful thinking. This mixed feeling made Tsurumi, who had been through the storms and had a broad mind, a little confused: His mouth, which was usually eloquent and able to speak eloquently, was now so dull that he couldn't say a word, as if half of his tongue had been cut off.

In his journey of life for the past twenty years or so, he had a Kikuko, but she was like a sister, and there was no need for a man to deal with a woman in a special way. When he met Yaoqun that day, Tsurumi was thinking deeply and planning a secret organization, seeking talents eagerly; moreover, although he was not high in the General Staff Headquarters at that time, his potential power was not small; for Yaoqun, it was a situation of sympathy and assistance, and the situation and ability could also lift heavy things lightly, so the posture of dealing with Yaoqun was extremely frank and natural, although it was inevitable that a little bit of male and female feelings were mixed in. Tsurumi didn't feel any difficulty in dealing with it.

Later, when he met Pingzi in Tokyo, Tsurumi was ready to bet everything and had long put life and death out of his mind. In dealing with Pingzi, there was only the distinction between enemy and friend, and there was no distinction between men and women, so he didn't feel any difficulty in dealing with her. When he was attacked by the imposter Kawashima Yoshiko in Beiping, Tsurumi's imagination was completely "soldiers come to block, water comes to earth", and he didn't care whether the other party was a woman or a man.

### Unpleasant Pleasantry

— Feng Zikai

On the way back from victory and demobilization, on a steamer from Hankou to Nanjing, I witnessed an unpleasant "pleasantry."

In my cabin, there were over a dozen bunks, men and women mixed together. My family occupied five bunks, and I was on the edge. Across from me was a middle-aged woman and an infant. Once, I saw this woman changing the infant's diaper. When she unfolded the diaper, what caught my attention was a large patch of red. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a Japanese flag. This flag was small, used as a diaper. The red sun was perfectly positioned to receive the infant's buttocks, not too big, not too small, as if custom-made. I blurted out! "Ah! It's a Japanese flag!" The woman said triumphantly, "Yes! His father brought it back from the front line. There are many, and I'm using them as diapers!" She flipped open the quilt to show me, and indeed there were several pieces. I looked at the one she had taken off, a pile of yellow feces right in the center of the red sun, the sides soaked in urine. I shook my head and sighed. The woman became even more proud, saying, "We suffered under them for decades. Today, it's time to turn the tables (turning the tables means revenge, not sure if this is the correct writing, to be verified.) and vent some anger! Hahahaha." I joined her with a "Hahahaha." Another person nearby said, "It's indeed a pleasantry!"

I remembered: Before the war of resistance, when Japan invaded China, the Chinese people hated Japan. Some even cursed the Japanese flag as a menstrual cloth. They said, "Among the world's flags, the Japanese one is the easiest to make. When a Japanese woman menstruates, she uses a handkerchief to block her genitals. The next day, she pulls it out, and the red circle in the center of the handkerchief becomes the national flag." Although this curse was vicious, it was just talk. Now, using the Japanese flag as a diaper is actually being put into practice. This is truly a "pleasantry!" But I feel so unpleasant!

This kind of behavior is too atrocious! It's like a hooligan cursing someone, or a mischievous child playing a prank. The past Japanese were indeed extremely atrocious. But how can we be like them? An ancient saying goes: "Do not dwell on old wrongs, thus resentment will be rare." A common saying: "Enmities should be resolved, not created." Now that they have surrendered, we should forget old wrongs. Only then can we show our character and maintain world peace. That's why I felt unpleasant after seeing that "pleasantry," because it is related to our character and hinders the future of world peace.

But later I thought again: Menstrual blood and urine, from a scientific point of view, are no different from saliva and mucus, with no distinction between high and low, noble and base. If everyone in the world viewed it that way, then it wouldn't matter. May 7, Year 36.

### A Small Drink in Chang'an

— Ke Ren

Tai Bai's Drinking Place

The Eight Immortals Temple outside Xiaodongmen is said to be where Lü Dongbin met Han Zhongli; the initial motivation for building the temple was based on the popular mythology of the Eight Immortals. The incense is still thriving, and on good days in spring and autumn, women from the countryside flock to it. A few steps east of here, there is a large stone tablet, deeply engraved with the five characters "Tai Bai's Drinking Place"; next to it is a thatched shed with several rows of low-legged benches. An old man tends a pot and sells rice wine; it is said that his family has been doing this for generations, for nearly a hundred years. The wine is sweet and mellow, suitable for drinking by the bowl, but it is quite potent; the wine referred to as "Tai Bai's斗酒" belongs to this category. The area around the Eight Immortals Temple is already a remote part of the suburbs, yet gentlemen and ladies still flock to it, as if startled, because this old man's rice wine is truly a unique delicacy in Guanzhong.

Chicken Shreds and Wax Meat

Wax meat is a special method of curing and smoking pork; the meat is in the shape of a disk, with red and white colors contrasting, extremely cooked and tender; using it to pair with wine is infinitely flavorful. It is sold everywhere in the market of Chang'an, with various small shops and stalls, but the best is sold by a butcher shop in Jisi Guai in Dongguan. There are three or four butcher shops in Jisi Guai, and the one referred to here is the tall-doored one on the south side of the road. Many of Chang'an's famous small drinking places have no names, and the scenery of the old capital is naturally different.

Old Ma's Waxed Mutton

The Northwest is a base for Muslims, and halal signs are displayed everywhere in the market. The cooking of beef and mutton is quite exquisite.

Waxed mutton is similar in nature to ordinary cured beef, with a slight taste of soy-braised meat, but it has a unique method and a world of its own; it can be called a fine product for pairing with wine in the cool autumn weather.

The most exquisite production and sale is by "Old Ma's"; however, there are many imitations, such as "Old Old Ma's," "Genuine Old Ma's," like the Wang Mazi scissors shop in Beijing, confusing people and making it difficult to distinguish the real from the fake. An insider told me that the one at the east entrance of Zhuba Market on West Street is more refined; and the quality of the finished product depends less on the chef's skill and more on whether the person buying the raw meat has sharp eyes; it is necessary to study what kind of mutton is suitable for making fine products.

Zhuba Market Mutton Soup Restaurant

In the Northwest, steamed buns are commonly called "馍 (mo)," and "泡 (pao)" means to soak; therefore, "羊肉泡馍 (yangrou paomo)" is a dish of steamed buns soaked in mutton soup. This kind of mutton soup is made from sheep's head, trotters, liver, mutton, etc., stewed into a "whole sheep fresh soup"; it must be added with a little chili to enhance the flavor and to suppress the fishy smell.

The steamed buns are made from pure flour and without any other ingredients. When soaking, the diner first tears it into small pieces, and then asks the waiter to take it away and add soup; if it is cut with a knife, it is feared that the soup will not easily penetrate.

It is said that the most famous mutton soup restaurant is the one at the south entrance of Zhuba Market.

Male A: This room's walls are covered with spots.

Male B: The last tenant living here was an inventor - he invented an explosive.

Male A: Oh, these spots on the wall are traces of the explosive.

Male B: Not the explosive, the inventor.

### Chaplin to Create New Type of Film

— Lian

Charlie Chaplin told reporters in New York on the 9th that he intends to create a new type of film that will be popular around the world, like his past silent films.

Chaplin now intends to eliminate subtitles and sound inserts in his new film, and replace them with explanations of actions and dialogues in the audience's native language. When the narrator speaks, the actor's voice should be faded. It is said that in his new film "Monsieur Verdoux," there are large sections of dialogue that cannot be translated into subtitles. Unless the audience understands English, they will lose the entire effect. This new method is the third and final stage of Chaplin's artistic evolution.

### How to Solve the Rice Crisis

— Yi

Following the rice frenzy in Hangzhou, Wujin and Suzhou also experienced rice rush, and unexpectedly Shanghai could not escape this exception. On the 7th, civilians rushed for rice, and on the 8th, rice merchants beat people and damaged shops.

The rice merchants' suffering has its root causes, but the civilians' shop smashing and rice snatching was originally motivated by temporary indignation and was not intentional. Now, the rice merchants are not settling the matter fairly, but retaliating with action, gathering crowds under the guise of petitioning, beating people and destroying shops, stepping into the legal net. Not only will those who previously sympathized with the rice shops being beaten feel cold, but even the government will find it difficult to protect this action as legal. Mayor Wu's reply to the rice industry representatives is telling. The rice merchants are digging their own graves, which is deeply regrettable!

For the current plan: Although rice merchants have police officers protecting the sale of rationed rice, in my opinion, this is not thorough enough. The best solution is to temporarily nationalize all rice shops in the city, concentrate the rice and grain in the hands of the government, plan as a whole, or immediately implement grain distribution based on population, supervised by district chiefs in conjunction with local gentry, institutions, factories, schools, and public educators, supervised by their superiors or responsible persons; In this way, rice merchants can clear the accusation of being "rice worms", the government can try out the distribution policy, and the people can trust the government's supply of "people's food."

On the contrary, if civilians beat shops today and rice merchants beat people tomorrow, there will be endless entanglements and no peaceful days. Those in politics in Shanghai will not have time to handle other affairs and will have to focus on "mediation" and "suppression" every day. If it spreads abroad, it will be discussed that Shanghai has degenerated to a barbaric period. I hope the government will adopt this.

### Play Onstage and Play Offstage

— Meng Long

Quite by chance, I watched Peking opera, which I hadn't watched for a long time, and it was Tong Zhiling's "best show" – Spinning Cotton.

This play has been popular for a long time. I remember it was once banned, supposedly because its content was "too that way." At the same time, as soon as the ban was issued, the play became even more popular, and Tong Zhiling's name was established both inside and outside the opera world. It is said that recently she nets more than 800,000 for each time she spins cotton. This time, she performed at the Tianchan Stage for 36 days, with a contracted salary of 80 million, which shows how popular her performances are!

I feel that the "劲 (jin - vigor)" in Tong Zhiling's performance is certainly not the right path for art, but it is not as terrible as some frivolous people say. It's just that the audience is too "sensitive." They are used to associating a "cherry mouth" with a certain part of a woman's body, just like when reading "Jin Ping Mei (金瓶梅)", the sound of Pan Jinlian calling "Dada" will uncontrollably make them "longing in their hearts."

To be honest, sitting there, I didn't find anything surprising or strange about Tong Zhiling's performance onstage. What I found curious was the play being performed by the audience offstage. A young man in his twenties from the foreign settlement, when he was absorbed in watching, seemed to be flowing with an expression that he couldn't suppress, and he unconsciously beamed, gaped, sighed, and shouted for joy in a strange voice. There was also an old man in his fifties sitting in the row in front of me, who, while watching Tong Zhiling, said solemnly, "What kind of play is this! It's outrageous!" If it weren't for the fact that we were in the theater, he would have burst out in a torrent of abuse, as if nothing less would be enough to suppress his anger. Shaking his head, scoffing, and waving his sleeves were still considered polite. However, I thought: Maybe this gentleman wanted to use this to stabilize his own "chaste" heart?

It was originally an insignificant play, but there were so many viewers, and there were so many faces and psychologies of such viewers, one kind of fluttering and carefree frivolity, and another kind of terrifying seriousness. So I had the above observations and expressed them, even if it is a kind of "scene" in the opera world.

### Dagger Behind a Smile

— Zikai

The other day, a newspaper published a special dispatch from Beiping, saying that there was a drama evening during Peking University's May Fourth Commemoration Week. When "A Woman and a Dog" was performed, someone went on stage to question: It is clearly a human, why is it titled "A Dog"? When another play, "Triumph," was staged, the audience was moved to tears because of the play's tragic and indignant plot. However, one person applauded and laughed loudly, causing public outrage, and they wanted to beat him severely, which was stopped only after mediation. After reading these two things, I really find them humorous. It's like in the legend, when Cao Cao is performed on stage, someone wants to drag him down and whip him. If this were used in humorous writing, it could be considered excellent. The stage and the audience becoming one, which originally showed how deeply moving the drama was, is a good thing. In modern drama, there are even special cases where the audience becomes the actors. However, the above two situations are another matter.

A play titled "A Woman and a Dog" is originally a kind of humor, but unfortunately, the person watching the play took it seriously. Although this matter itself is more humorous than the drama, at that time it was not humorous at all. Conversely, another play was probably a tragedy, so the people watching it took it seriously and shed tears of sympathy. However, when the audience was unanimously in tears, one person alone felt a sense of humor and applauded and laughed loudly. This bit of humor he revealed was unbearable to the serious majority, which aroused public outrage and they wanted to beat him severely. Imagining that time, this humorous spectator would not be able to continue being humorous.

Looking at these two things together, we get the impression that the current society has lost its normalcy. Abnormal things are constantly happening. Taking a humorous play seriously to the point of going on stage to question is abnormal; everyone being sad and crying while someone applauds and laughs loudly is also abnormal. Someone applauding and laughing loudly while the crowd is enraged and wants to beat them severely is also abnormal. Another impression is the inability to tolerate each other. Humorous people ridicule the serious, and serious people cannot tolerate humor. The latter is especially a common problem in the current world. The last impression is the collapse of customs and traditions. The spectator going on stage to question is a clear example. Perhaps my words are not clear enough. But we can all see that there is a trend right now that is overthrowing everything, good and bad, indiscriminately, creating a kind of chaos. This is not a revolution, but it is worth everyone's vigilance. We must at least save those things that are worth leaving behind.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

The battle for the seat next to the driver began fiercely.

Almost everyone who was sitting on the driver's platform was immediately driven down, and Lan and Feifei were no exception.

"Isn't anyone allowed to sit here?" Zhang Chang was not convinced. He rushed over first, staring at the tall, thin driver who was yelling at Lan and Feifei to get off the truck, and questioned him loudly.

"No one is allowed to sit here! What are you going to do about it?" The driver squinted his eyes, lowered his face, and replied arrogantly.

Zhang Chang, full of youthful energy, was about to fight this arrogant driver.

"Mr. Zhang, you really are a child!" Lan had already jumped down from the driver's platform and stopped Zhang Chang with a smile. "I didn't want to sit here in the first place. Wouldn't it be more lively if everyone sat in the back?"

Zhang Chang glared angrily and clenched his fists, staring at the driver. Although the driver was even more arrogant than him, he saw that the person who had occupied the seat was so polite and had already taken the initiative to get off the truck, so he didn't want to make trouble. He just snorted in his nose and hurriedly turned around to greet another short, fat woman with many large and small packages in her hands to get on the truck. He was afraid that if this money-paying customer didn't get on the truck, the seats Lan and Feifei had given up might be occupied by someone even more ruthless or with a bigger background.

"Sisi, play with Uncle Zhang! I'll go up to the truck and take a look first." Lan was as calm as if nothing had happened, and handed Feifei to Zhang Chang – in order to prevent him from fighting with the tall, thin driver again – and then happily climbed to the back of the truck.

The driver's seats of the other four trucks had already become a mess.

Zhang Chang, his anger still not extinguished, held Feifei's hand, still standing in place, staring wide-eyed at the driver and the fat woman who was getting on the truck.

"I'll do it, I'll do it!" The tall, thin driver was fawning with a smile, taking care of his big customer, rushing to put her many packages away, and even folding his old clothes and pressing them on the wooden plank as a cushion.

"Damn it! I don't know how much money he took!" Zhang Chang thought in his head.

But just as the driver was about to help his big customer get on the truck, something disappointing happened. A flurry of high-top leather boots came from the left. The one walking in the front was the young Director Xiong. Behind him was a thin man in his middle age wearing a very exquisite suit, holding a very elaborate cane. On the right was a woman who was half his age and not very beautiful. In the back were a high-ranking military officer wearing an eagle crown and a sword, and two orderlies carrying a few simple pieces of small and exquisite luggage.
