### Economic Reform Plan: Preliminary Comprehensive Review; Decisions Made on Both Increasing Revenue and Reducing Expenditure

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] A subcommittee review meeting composed of the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Four Joint Offices made a preliminary comprehensive review with reference to the economic reform plan and the national mobilization guidelines. The details are as follows:

In terms of fiscal revenue, increase tariff sources and raise tax rates. In terms of expenditure, reduce unnecessary institutions. The expenses of various agencies will not be increased unless they have been approved and deemed necessary. Local finances should strive for self-sufficiency, rectify existing taxes and tax rates.

Loans from banks and bureaus should be targeted at industries that produce daily necessities for the people. The loan method should be based on ordering and lending real objects in principle. The control of national banks and private banks will be strengthened at the same time to prevent smuggling and capital flight. In addition to strengthening anti-smuggling funds and expanding anti-smuggling strength, domestic remittances will be fully allocated by the Central Bank. With regard to the control of finance, measures for controlling urban finance have been drafted. Inspections of the business operations of banks and merchants will be strengthened, and violations of regulations will be strictly prohibited. The establishment of branches will be restricted, customer accounts will be investigated, loan targets will be specified, and loan uses will be reviewed. All these have been clearly defined.

In terms of commodity prices, the basic policy is to control materials. The regulation of cotton yarn and cloth will be handled by the Cotton Textile Regulation Committee, using cotton to control yarn and yarn to control cloth as a means. The price will be determined by the joint negotiation of various manufacturers based on market supply and demand, and its allocation will be mainly targeted at the reproduction industry.

The China Textile Company is responsible for the supply of cooking oil, which will be implemented in Nanjing and Shanghai for the time being. For the distribution of fuel coal, several large coal mines are designated to increase production, which will be uniformly charged by the Fuel Management Committee to supply various public utilities and transportation coal. If there is surplus capacity, it will be used for civilian purposes. Its supply is also limited to Nanjing and Shanghai for the time being.

In terms of increasing production, the disposal of enemy and puppet factories that have not been sold should be accelerated, either by repairing them or dismantling them, so that each piece of equipment can be used to its maximum effect. It is hoped that Japanese reparations factories can be properly coordinated with production. Establish industrial and mining equipment warehouses in various important areas so that materials can be smoothly regulated and stored. Local industry and commerce guidance offices can participate in the preliminary review and post-event inspection of industrial and mining loans in various places.

In terms of international trade, due to the large number of existing institutions and the decentralization of powers, it is better to organize a unified institution to handle everything. The purchase of export materials will be increased, the scope of export bills of exchange will be expanded, and export costs will be reduced.

In commercial management, in addition to supporting legitimate commerce, speculation and hoarding will be strictly prohibited. In order to revitalize the capital operation of various commercial firms, the revaluation of assets and the increase of equity capital will be accelerated. In order to find a home for idle funds in various places to avoid harming the market, securities markets will be established in major cities as appropriate.

### Various Parties Are Not Optimistic About the Sino-Japanese Trade Issue

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Various circles in China are quite indifferent to the hope of Sino-Japanese trade after August 15. They are quite dissatisfied with MacArthur's policy of subsidizing Japanese export trade. It is heard that the Executive Yuan will convene representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss the Japanese export subsidy policy. The business community is deeply afraid that this subsidy policy will lead to Japan's dumping policy and hinder Chinese industry. Officials pointed out that the United States opposed the incentive policy of the former President of the Executive Yuan, but the United States is considering taking the same measures for defeated Japan. As for the future of Sino-Japanese trade, it is generally believed that it is not very bright. Most of the Japanese export goods are on the list of Chinese import prohibitions, and China cannot supply Japan with the goods it needs, such as soybeans and coal. In addition, there are difficulties in exchange rates. So far, there is no specified rate between the Chinese legal tender and the Japanese yen. All transactions are calculated in US dollars, which is also considered impractical because China's foreign exchange reserves seem to be inadequate. However, various steps have now been taken to prepare to participate in trade with Japan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided to request the National Federation of Commerce and Industry and the Industrial Association to submit a list of 192 traders each, so that the government can select 64 from them. This number is what the Allied Headquarters allowed China to propose. Among them will be eight overseas traders.

### Liu Kejun Discusses Quotas, Says Extremely Careful Approach Taken

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After the passage of the constitutional regulations, there has been considerable dissatisfaction from various parties regarding the allocation of quotas for National Assembly delegates and legislators. Professional organizations, women's groups, and overseas Chinese organizations have all raised concerns, believing that the quota allocation needs revision. On the 15th, our reporter interviewed Liu Kejun, convener of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, to inquire about these opinions. Liu stated that the Legislative Yuan had considered both legal principles and factual circumstances when discussing the quota allocation. Each committee member took the discussions very seriously, and every decision was made after lengthy deliberation, ensuring fairness. Regarding the allocation of legislator seats for professional representatives, the final number was set at eighty-four, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan, thus having full legal basis. The quota of five seats for merchant groups is also limited by the factual situation. According to the original plan, agricultural and labor groups were supposed to be allocated 60%, but this has been reduced, demonstrating that various aspects were taken into consideration when the Legislative Yuan discussed this type of allocation. As for the requirement for national women's organizations to have five branches, this was initially proposed by a female legislator, whose original intention was to promote the healthy development of women's organizations. The committee members believed that the intention was excellent and therefore approved it. Women's organizations can still register, and there is still time to establish branches in various locations. Regarding the allocation of quotas for overseas Chinese, during the discussions in the Legislative Yuan, everyone from President Sun down advocated for an increase. In fact, the quotas have already been increased, so it cannot be said that it is unfair.

### Communist Troops Break Faith and Destroy Yellow River Embankments; National Army Resolves to Fight Back; UNRRA Personnel Involved in Restoring Embankments in Communist Areas Should Withdraw Immediately; General Chen Notifies Cleveland

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces have broken faith and crossed the Yellow River to invade, destroying the embankments. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng notified UNRRA's China Office Director Cleveland of this in a memorandum on July 8th. The memorandum is recorded as follows: "To Director Cleveland: Regarding memorandum No. 614 from Zhang Hao dated July 1, it has been found that the Communist Liu Bocheng's forces have violated the ceasefire agreement and deceived contacts by using the guise of embankment restoration to expand their rebellion. Therefore, the previous request from General Egerton for the government to guarantee no military threat from government forces in recent weeks is ineffective. UNRRA personnel assigned to embankment restoration work in Communist areas should withdraw immediately. Otherwise, the government cannot be held responsible for any unexpected damages suffered by the restoration workers. As for the reasons for the Communist Party's breach of agreement and breaking faith, please inquire with the Communist side for clarification. This is to notify you for your information and action, and please provide a reply. Respectfully, Chen Cheng, Chief of Staff."

Furthermore, the military spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense issued a statement on the 15th, stating: As the Yellow River flood season approaches this year, the government previously agreed to the embankment restoration plan proposed by UNRRA's China Office Director Cleveland, organizing a joint committee and agreeing that both sides would immediately cease all military actions in the Yellow River coastal area. The government's actions were purely out of concern for the lives and property of millions of people and to prevent an unprecedented disaster. Therefore, a general order was issued to the National Army in the Lu-Yu area to temporarily cease pursuing the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces, who were about to be pacified, in order to build the river embankments and prevent flooding. Chen Cheng officially replied to UNRRA General Egerton from a military command standpoint, guaranteeing that Yellow River embankment restoration workers would not be subjected to military threats, and provided three suggestions for UNRRA's attention: (1) UNRRA should guarantee that no Communist armed forces are mixed in with the personnel participating in embankment restoration work in the Communist area; (2) The number of wooden boats used for embankment restoration at each crossing point should be limited to fifty; (3) The joint committee must be actively established, and offices should be set up in each work area on the north bank of the Yellow River in Lu Province. Subsequently, the government dispatched Major General Ye Nan of the Ministry of National Defense to participate in the joint committee on behalf of the government. While rushing to repair the embankments day and night, Liu Bocheng's subordinate Yang Yong led more than 5,000 troops across the Yellow River from Shilipu near the Grand Canal on June 22nd, and Liu Bocheng's five columns, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th, also crossed the river near Wuxizhuang, ten kilometers south of Puyang County, at 12:30 AM on June 30th, taking advantage of the National Army's withdrawal to seize crossings and cover the subsequent troops to continue crossing south, occupying Beiwangzhao, capturing Youcheng, and besieging Yuncheng. It is reported today that more than 30,000 Communist bandits have crossed the river. Such actions, using UNRRA's embankment restoration as a guise to cross the river, breaking faith, and seizing opportunities, have caused unexpected damage to our defending soldiers and civilians along the Yellow River. Therefore, we solemnly declare that, for the sake of self-defense and for the sake of the lives, property, and security of millions of good people in the Lu-Yu area, the National Army will resolutely fight back and will not be restricted by UNRRA General Egerton's "government guarantee of no military threat from our forces in recent weeks." Furthermore, from today onward, all UNRRA personnel engaged in embankment restoration in the Lu-Yu area should immediately withdraw to safe areas. Otherwise, the government cannot be held responsible for any unexpected damages suffered as a result.

### Isoya Re-Examined Yesterday, Debate Concluded, Sentencing Set for the 22nd

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Japanese war criminal Renzo Isoya was re-examined by the War Crimes Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense yesterday morning, and the debate was conducted. It began at 9:15 AM and concluded around 12:00 PM. The court ordered the debate to be concluded and set the sentencing for the 22nd.

Defense Lawyers Present Two Points

Court President Shi Meiyu, the judges, and others attended the court. After the opening was announced, the appointed defense lawyers Yu Shuzhen and Chen Hanqing stood up to present their opinions. Wang stated: The defendant submitted a defense statement on the 12th, stating that the defendant still had many pieces of evidence in Japan that were en route to Nanjing. Is there a need for the court to conduct further investigations on this matter and change the date of the debate? Chen stated: According to the defendant's claims, he is a loyal follower of our late Premier, strongly advocating Sino-Japanese friendship and making contributions to the Chinese revolution. Could Mr. Dai Jitao be invited to testify? Judge Shi replied: Regarding the two points mentioned, after deliberation, the first point, that the defense statement has not yet been received by the court; the second point, regarding the defendant's crimes against humanity, we can determine this based on his usual moral behavior, without the need to summon Mr. Dai and others to testify. As for the issue of the defense statement not arriving on time, we can extend the debate time, but cannot change the date.

Isoya Presents a Set of Old Arguments

At this time, the prosecutor began his arguments, listing his crimes. Isoya then began his defense. First, regarding the expulsion of civilians in Hong Kong, he defended himself by saying that the evacuation of the people was out of the people's voluntary return to their hometowns, first registering with the civil affairs department and then handling the selection of their hometowns, which was voluntary and not forced. The other part of the exiled were bad elements, and for the sake of protecting the order of the majority of the people, the exile of criminals occurred, but no civilians were exiled. Next, regarding the war crimes, he argued as in the investigation court, only saying that his concept of Sino-Japanese friendship has never changed, and he has shown this in China and Hong Kong. He claims that all war crimes attributed to him do not match the time and place. Then, regarding the crimes against humanity, Isoya still claimed that all illegal acts of the army were unrelated to him. Finally, regarding the implementation of the poisoning policy in Hong Kong, he said that when the army entered Hong Kong, there were many opium dens in Hong Kong, and there were many opium smokers, so he decided to adopt a gradual reduction method and register them and sell opium publicly, without any intention of poisoning. Then, he submitted the defense statement to the court, and it was already 11:40.

Two Lawyers Defend Responsibly

The defense lawyers then stood up to make defenses on his behalf. Attorney Chen first denied the "war criminal" title of Isoya, saying that Isoya was no longer a war criminal when he came to China and should be studied by the court. The remaining three defenses: (1) The crime of violating peace is inferred from Isoya's work that he must have participated in the Japanese invasion plan, but this is only speculation and not a fact, so it is not established; (2) The constitution of war crimes and crimes against humanity does not match the evidence of time and place. Regarding the poisoning of Hong Kong, it is believed that Hong Kong already had a popular opium epidemic and should not be responsible for the poisoning; (3) The matter of exiling civilians was to exile bad elements who disrupted public order to protect the safety of the majority of the people and did not exile civilians. The conclusion is to ask the court to judge leniently. Attorney Wang denied the points of violating peace, publicly selling opium, harming civilians, and exiling civilians, and emphasized that Isoya had loved the Republic of China since he was a child and was a loyal follower of the Premier, advocating Sino-Japanese cooperation, and had no aggressive ambitions for our territory. The debate ended at about 12:00.

### Fu Jiaojin Believes Yellow River Flows Through Sichuan Province Claim is Baseless

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] When a reporter inquired with Fu Jiaojin, Director of the Department of Territorial Affairs of the Ministry of Interior, today about the claim that the upper reaches of the Yellow River flow through Sichuan Province, he stated: The Yellow River originates from the north of the Bayan Har Mountains, flows through Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, and then turns east into Shanxi and Henan. The claim that it flows through Sichuan Province has been rumored for a long time and is outdated. The areas near the borders of Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan are mostly forests, high mountains, and dangerous obstacles, with sparse population. The area has always been inhabited by the Lolo people, with little contact with the outside world. This area is commonly known as the Lolo Region. Although the boundaries of the three provinces have been delineated, they have not yet been clearly surveyed. The claim by Ma Biwei that the Yellow River flows through Sichuan Province has no factual basis. Mr. Fu also stated: The Department of Territorial Affairs will soon send personnel to survey the undefined borders of various provinces, cities, and counties in the country to determine their boundaries and the scope of their jurisdiction.

### Hankou Commodity Tax Bureau Illegally Collects Taxes, Embezzling Over 4 Billion Yuan; Citizens Report, Evidence of Receipts, Account Books, etc., Confirmed

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] A shocking corruption case in the Hankou Commodity Tax Bureau has recently been exposed here. The case was initiated by citizens reporting the bureau's illegal collection of cattle hide taxes. After more than 40 days of investigation by Sun Lilu, a supervisor from the Ministry of Finance, it was found that the collection of taxes on raw cattle hides was indeed unauthorized. The bureau was ordered to return the taxes. It was also discovered that the bureau illegally collected "inspection fees" ranging from 500 to 3,000 yuan per package for items such as tobacco leaves, local wine, flour, cotton yarn, and sugar. Statistics show that the monthly private collection of disguised taxes exceeded 500 million yuan, and the total amount embezzled from November of last year to June of this year was at least over 4 billion yuan. As a result of the fraud and smuggling, the national treasury suffered even greater losses, three times this amount. Mr. Sun solemnly stated: He has obtained receipts from the tax collectors and other account books containing "black fees," which serve as solid evidence for this case.

Afterward, according to Vandenberg, President Truman believed that there was no need to convene a special session of Congress this autumn; however, he reserved the right to convene a special session of Congress in the event of an emergency. Looking at the world from the White House meeting, it can be seen that the world today is still lingering at the crossroads of war and peace. If we observe the future trends of the world with a pleasant attitude, we may not be able to be optimistic, at least in the recent five or ten years, no country dares to lightly talk about war, and no country's people are willing to go to war. Therefore, no matter what, a "no war" peace can ultimately be maintained for five or ten years. However, the weather is unpredictable, and the international situation is ever-changing. No one can predict the development of the world political situation; especially the United States, which bears the responsibility for world security, is currently making plans for a rainy day. This really makes us unable to be optimistic.

Recently, the most noteworthy measures taken by the United States to actively prepare for future wars include the following: (1) The United States Department of the Army has drafted a six-year plan to store military raw materials on the American continent that are difficult to obtain but necessary when war breaks out again; including rare metals recently discovered in the Soviet Union, India, and Africa, as well as petroleum imported into the United States from the Middle East. (2) Based on the conclusions obtained from the atomic bomb test on Bikini Atoll, the United States Navy believes that only submarines can avoid atomic bomb attacks and has begun to build a super submarine fleet, which can be used for reconnaissance and transportation in the future. (3) All the islands previously held by Japan in the Pacific Ocean have significant military strategic value in future wars and will be transferred by the United Nations to the United States for sole trusteeship. The United States Congress has drafted a bill, which has been passed by both houses and will soon be submitted to the White House for President Truman to sign.

The United States is actively preparing militarily to cope with major international changes in the future. Although this is a passive approach and increases the risk of deepening the international situation; however, on the other hand, since the United States has no way to eliminate international opposition politically, diplomatically, or economically, thereby promoting international understanding and cooperation, and jointly maintaining permanent peace, it naturally has no choice but to make plans for a rainy day in the military in case of emergency: or because of the strength and sufficient preparation of the United States, it can instead eliminate other countries' ambitions for aggression, the so-called "stopping war with war, eliminating war with war." When we recall the general history of the eve of the outbreak of World War II, the weakness of peace-loving democratic countries was sufficient to encourage the arrogance of aggressors. General historians believe that if the fascist Japan, Italy, and Nazi Germany had been severely attacked when they began their aggression, World War II might not have broken out; even if it had broken out, if democratic countries had been fully prepared earlier and had the ability to stop Japan's aggression against China and Germany's aggression against Poland, World War II would not have lasted so long. Therefore, the recent plans made by the United States for a rainy day are, in any case, worthy of our attention.

Nearly two full years have passed since the victorious end of the war, and the evolution of the international situation has been deteriorating, which is really disappointing; wartime allies fought for victory, and victory was finally achieved; after the war, the allies created peace, but not only did they fail to achieve anything, but instead made peace leave this world, getting farther and farther away. President Truman, in view of the seriousness of the world situation and believing that some countries are threatened by external forces, specifically proposed to Congress the plan to aid Greece and Turkey, helping them develop strong forces sufficient to resist the intrusion of external forces, which has become the Truman Doctrine known to everyone today. If we are fair, the purpose of the Truman Doctrine is also to maintain world peace; however, the Truman Doctrine has unexpectedly aroused a profound reaction from the Soviet Union. Hungary first experienced a coup d'état, and similar events occurred in Bulgaria and Romania, making some Balkan countries even more controlled by the Soviet Union, and the phenomenon of European division has become increasingly blatant. If this terrible trend is not reversed, it will lead to a more serious crisis in the world. Secretary of State Marshall, in view of the failure of the Truman Doctrine, also had the intention to change the course of American foreign policy, and gave a speech at Harvard University at the beginning of last month, proposing the United States' plan to economically assist the recovery of European countries, the motives of which are two: (1) to include the Soviet Union in the scope of the US aid to Europe plan, in order to test whether the Soviet Union has the sincerity to cooperate with the United States; (2) to assist the European countries devastated by the war, so that their societies, economies, and politics will not collapse, which would be conducive to the growth and development of the Communist Party. However, the result obtained after the publication of the Marshall Plan led to the division of Europe. Not only did the Soviet Union refuse to participate in the European Economic Conference, but the Soviet Union's eight vassal states also rejected the invitations from Britain and France. The Soviet Union also announced the "Molotov Plan," attempting to organize an economic group in Eastern and Central Europe; from then on, Europe was clearly divided into two major groups, either black or white.

Under such circumstances, the European Economic Conference will naturally not have good achievements. The United States needs to spend about 200 billion US dollars to assist Europe, and American taxpayers have long called for reducing their burdens. Seeing the actual situation in Europe, they are even less willing to use large sums of money on Europe. Therefore, looking forward to the future of Europe, it feels even more gloomy.

### The Urgent Housing Rent Problem Awaiting Solution

The housing rental problem is one of the most urgent problems awaiting solution at present, and it is also one of the most difficult problems to solve. Today, the municipal government will invite relevant parties to discuss it together. What the plan is and what the result will be are still unknown. We believe that if this problem is to be effectively solved, the following four points must be taken into account:

1. A comprehensive plan must be made, and one cannot only think of one side. It is a fact that the real estate industry is currently unprofitable, and it is also a fact that there is a serious housing shortage and it is difficult to find a house: no one is building new houses, no one is repairing old houses, kind owners are enduring losses and are at a loss, while those who are cunning and vicious are extorting in every way, repeatedly increasing rents, and openly exceeding the rent rate stipulated by the municipal government, even by a thousand times or even ten thousand times. Therefore, if the municipal government wants to implement regulations on rent rates, it must take into account the interests of all parties, and make appropriate and reasonable decisions, so that it can be promoted smoothly and in accordance with the circumstances.

2. Orders must be obeyed and not just become empty words. As mentioned above: kind people suffer losses, and vicious people extort in every way, which is due to the fact that laws cannot be implemented automatically. Therefore, after agreeing on a uniform rent rate, it is necessary to simultaneously agree on effective enforcement measures, and closely coordinate with judicial authorities to earnestly implement them, so that those who abide by the law are protected, and those who violate the law have no way to act recklessly, and then this newly revised rent rate will have meaning. Otherwise, an empty piece of paper is equivalent to the current situation, and it will definitely not improve the current rental situation, nor will it alleviate the suffering of both parties, and it may even make things worse.

3. The bad habit of tenants seeking profit must be corrected. Currently, most kind landlords are suffering losses, while many tenants, the so-called second landlords, are occupying other people's property, demanding various fees, renting at high prices, and earning unjustifiable profits. There is no justifiable reason to explain these situations. Now, for the sake of protecting the general tenants, if the landlords still need to be subject to considerable restrictions, then the second landlords similar to the landlords should be strictly restricted, so as to show the fairness of things. Otherwise, favoring one side and neglecting the other will only protect the second landlords, increase the landlords' disappointment, and will not help alleviate the suffering of the third tenants.

4. Paying rent in foreign currency and in kind must be strictly prohibited. The government has long prohibited paying rent in foreign currency, but in reality, it has not disappeared. As for paying rent in kind, due to the excessive fluctuations in commodity prices, this trend has gradually spread from the inland to Shanghai. This not only damages the credibility of the legal currency but also deepens the burden on the tenants. Regardless of whether the rent rate is adjusted or not, this matter should be strictly prohibited to protect the welfare of the majority.

The so-called rental problem is actually too complicated. The landlords demand that the restriction on rent should be based on the provisions of Article 97 of the Land Law, which is based on the law. Whether a fixed-term lease contract should be extended indefinitely is also a legal issue. And opening up the ban on mortgaging real estate, and setting up a land bank to finance long-term funds are even more related to solving the housing shortage and activating finance. We suspect that the municipal government is only focusing on what is most urgent, and may not have time to do so, so we will only briefly contribute our views on the rent problem for the authorities' reference.

### Britain and the United States Watch the Development of the Situation in Greece, Allied Fleet Sails to Athens, Security Council Convenes Emergency Meeting, Greek Government Forces Turn Favorable in Epirus

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: The Greek Minister of Air Force recently announced: In the Epirus area, the situation has turned favorable for the government forces. The Greek guerrillas who went south to attack Genoa have been contained by the government forces' pincer offensive. The Greek Senate also stated that a certain army has a tendency to launch a "new strategy" from Yugoslavia.

[United Press, Athens, 15th] Military sources stated today: A decisive battle in northern Greece is imminent. Government forces have seized multiple strongholds on the Vouchi River Valley road leading to Ioannina, the capital of Epirus Province, and the pincer encirclement of the leftist guerrillas who went south from Konitsa two days ago will be closed.

[Reuters, Athens, 14th] Greek government forces have won the battle of Korçë and have completely gained the initiative. American, Australian and Soviet representatives of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Team have flown from Thessaloniki to the war zone for inspection. A senior government official believes that the offensive in Korçë is related to the Greek Communists' attempts to establish a "free government." There is now a definite plan to declare the Communist Party and all parties colluding with the Communist Party to form a "free government" illegal. These plans include continued arrests, occupying the headquarters of leftist political parties, and closing down Communist and leftist newspapers.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: According to the Greek newspaper Estia, a large British and American fleet (including an aircraft carrier) arrived today in Piraeus, southwest of Athens.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting today on the invasion of Greece. American representative Johnson warned that the council must immediately stop discussing other issues and address the Balkan problem. Johnson stated that the United States is paying attention to the new developments in the Greek situation. According to the Greek ambassador to the United States, he was ordered by his government to notify the United Nations that a powerful enemy force of armed soldiers invaded Greek territory from Albania on the 13th of this month, and there were irregular troops and international brigades organized by the Communist Party, which are now concentrated on the Albanian border.

[United Press, London, 15th] A Foreign Office spokesman stated today that the British government is currently investigating reports of an "international brigade" invading Greece. If it is proven that such a brigade exists, Britain and the United States will jointly file a complaint with the UN. British and American military and political authorities in Greece have exchanged information on this serious change in the situation. It is difficult to predict whether British troops will be ordered to join the fighting.

### Completion of Organization of Various Committees; European Conference to Adjourn; Resource Surveys of Each Country to be Completed by September 1st

[Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 15th Broadcast: The heads of the economic conference of sixteen European nations recently declared: Although the US Congress will not be able to take action on the Marshall Plan before winter, the collaborative organization for the revival of Europe will continue to proceed. French officials declared: The original plan of the sixteen European countries participating in this conference to complete the surveys of their respective national resources and dollar needs by September 1st remains unchanged.

[United Press Paris, 15th Dispatch] The European Economic Conference convened its third plenary session today to discuss the draft organization of five technical subcommittees and a secretariat proposed by the Rules of Procedure Committee. This plenary session will be the last one before the end of August. Chairman Bevin indicated that everything is proceeding smoothly.

[United Press Paris, 14th Dispatch] The working committee of the European Economic Conference unanimously passed the final draft for the implementation of the Marshall Plan today, designating the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands as members of the executive committee, and resolving the list of candidates for the four technical subcommittees as follows: Food and Agriculture—United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, and the Netherlands. Steel Industry—United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, Norway, and Turkey. Transportation—United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, and Turkey. Fuel and Electricity—United Kingdom, France, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Turkey, Sweden, and Switzerland. The list of candidates for each committee will be submitted to the third plenary session on the 15th for formal approval. According to French sources, the session on the 15th is likely to be the last one before the end of August, and further sessions will be convened after the work of the committees is completed. The Cooperation Committee will be attended by all sixteen participating countries and will have overall supervisory power over the decisions of the Executive Committee. The Working Committee also approved the establishment of a secretariat, with French representative Serroulle as Secretary-General, starting work on the 16th. Sweden was not included in the Executive Committee this time, and except for the Fuel and Electricity Subcommittee, it did not participate in the other three subcommittees. Steel is one of the country's major industries, but it is not named in the Steel Industry Subcommittee, which is particularly noteworthy. At the same time, a spokesman for the Dutch delegation stated that the Netherlands would promote the inclusion of western Germany in the European Recovery Program. It is said that Germany is the Netherlands' natural hinterland, and its western part must join the organization of sixteen countries, so that the French occupation zone and the British and American occupation zones can be combined into one. In addition, the Soviet Union continues to be very concerned about the progress of the conference. Although the Kremlin is deeply unhappy with the conference, it is still paying close attention to it.

### Soviet Ambassador Visits Italian Foreign Minister

[Reuters Paris, 14th Dispatch] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza had a thirty-minute conversation with Soviet Ambassador to France, Bogomolov, today at the Italian Embassy. An Italian spokesman said: The Soviet Ambassador's visit was an informal visit and was not pre-arranged, nor was it at Bogomolov's request. Sforza and Bogomolov met in Salerno, Italy, during the war, when Bogomolov was the Soviet envoy to Italy. Sforza came to Paris to attend the European Economic Conference and left a card to greet Bogomolov, who personally visited the Italian Embassy this morning. It is reported that the two may have discussed the European economy and the Italian peace treaty. Also, Sforza has already met with former French Prime Minister Blum.

### Marshall Delivers Speech; Explains Necessity of US Aid to Europe; Relationship Between US and Allied European Nations Faces Turning Point

[Agence France-Presse, Salt Lake City, USA, 14th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech to the Governors' Conference here tonight, warning the American people that if American aid does not arrive, European countries may change direction to the detriment of the United States. Once the United States recognizes this fact, it will certainly provide such assistance. In this regard, it is necessary for the government to obtain full support from the public. Marshall said: It is a difficult task to make ordinary people clearly understand international issues. Unless it is an eloquent speaker like Churchill, it is impossible to combine diplomatic rhetoric with pressing reality to make ordinary people understand the truth of the matter. The American people should give enthusiastic and sympathetic understanding to Europe's efforts to overcome national barriers and solve common economic problems.

The American people must make a decision on the current world situation, and this decision will have a profound impact on the future development of the situation. Our relationship with the traditional allies of the Old World is at a turning point, and this level should not be ignored. If we do not complete the task of assisting these countries to adapt to the needs of the new era, we must sit idly by as these countries change direction, contrary to their own traditions and our traditions. If so, the United States' position in the world will change dramatically. To date, efforts to restore the European economy have not been successful, but their benefits are greater than generally recognized. The United States can now more accurately estimate the needs of European countries and is carefully studying the implementation of various possible solutions from the perspective of American interests.

### Bevin Returns to England Today

[Reuters Paris, 15th Dispatch] British sources believe that Foreign Minister Bevin may return to London today or tomorrow to attend the Transport and General Workers' Association meeting in Hastings on Thursday. If the Paris Conference can develop according to the planned schedule, the leaders of the delegations can entrust experts to carry out the work of the committees after today. After reaching this stage, Bevin will entrust the affairs to Mr. Frank, an expert in the British delegation, to be responsible for carrying it out.

### Poland May Reconsider Its Attitude Toward the Marshall Plan

[Reuters London, 15th Dispatch] Kaplica, a spokesman for the Polish Embassy in London, said: If the institutions established by the Paris Conference are within the scope of the United Nations institutions or the European Economic Commission, Poland may reconsider its attitude toward the Marshall Plan.

[United Press London, 14th Dispatch] A Polish government spokesman recently criticized the economic conference held in Paris at a press conference here, saying that one of its main purposes was to revive Germany. He also explained the reasons for Poland's refusal to participate, saying that Warsaw had received secret intelligence that the conference had been arranged in advance, so it was more or less a "puppet" conference.

### Republican Leader in US House of Representatives Advocates Independent Congressional Investigation of Overseas Situation in Order to Formulate Foreign Aid Bill Next Year

[United Press Washington, 15th Dispatch] It was learned today that a group of Republican members of the House of Representatives are advocating that Congress conduct an independent investigation of the overseas military and economic situation in order to formulate any bills related to foreign countries in 1948. The investigation will be based on a bill drafted under the guidance of the House Republican Standing Committee and will be implemented by a special committee designated by Speaker Martin. According to Martin, the Republicans believe that Congress should collect its own information when discussing the Marshall Plan or other plans related to foreign countries, and should not rely entirely on the reports provided by various executive agencies and political committees. The special investigation committee to be established will include representatives of the House committees related to administrative affairs and foreign plans, conduct investigations at home and abroad, seek direct information, and submit it for discussion when Congress convenes in January next year. Congress must know the needs of various countries and the United States' ability to meet these needs. In addition to the advice provided by the two committees within the State Department and one committee outside the government recently established by President Truman to investigate the overseas situation, we should also obtain other opinions.

### Stassen Vigorously Advocates Elimination of the American Communist Party; Firmly Supports the Marshall Plan

[United Press Washington, 15th Dispatch] Republican presidential candidate Stassen advocated on the 15th that a carefully considered and effective plan be formulated to convince the Kremlin that there is no hope for the Communist Party to infiltrate and control the United States. Stassen firmly supports the Marshall Plan and demands that Congress take action before adjourning so that the government has the power to pre-order $500 million worth of industrial equipment. Stassen also said, "We have not abandoned the eight Eastern European countries that refused to participate in the Paris Conference."

### Republican Congressman Mason Advocates Cutting off Relations with the Soviet Union; Only One Congressman Advocates Stopping Relief to Eastern Europe

[Reuters Washington, 14th Dispatch] Several Republican congressmen are advocating an economic blockade against Eastern European countries that refuse to participate in the Marshall Economic Recovery Plan or refuse to cooperate with the United States. Illinois Congressman Chiperfield stated that he advocates that the United States sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and isolate it until the Soviet Union is prepared to cooperate. Congressman Dickson of the same state advocated that Eastern European countries that refuse to participate in the Marshall Plan should not be allowed to receive relief from the $350 million war-torn country relief plan. Wisconsin Congressman Byrnes revealed that he had written to the President, requesting that relief to countries that refuse to participate in the Paris Conference be stopped.

### United States Stops Food Exports to Czechoslovakia

[Reuters Washington, 14th Dispatch] Secretary of Agriculture Anderson mentioned the wheat agreement between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia at a press conference today, saying that the United States does not intend to supply any food to Czechoslovakia at present. The United States does not intend to supply grain to countries that can obtain adequate food supplies from elsewhere. Although Anderson did not accuse the Soviet Union of not supplying food to needy countries, he said that the Soviet Union has a large surplus of grain available for export this year. Anderson also said that there is no hope for the British and American zones in Germany to become self-sufficient in agriculture. When Anderson mentioned the refusal of several European countries to participate in the economic cooperation conference, he said that the United States, regardless of political relations, always acts with compassion, and he truly does not know how much more compassion the United States needs. Anderson also revealed that in his report on his inspection of Germany this time, he will focus on increasing the production of Ruhr coal in order to increase Germany's exports and exchange for food imports.

### England Rejects US Invitation to Discuss Ruhr Coal Problem

[Agence France-Presse London, 14th Dispatch] Regarding the US government's invitation to the United Kingdom to hold a conference in the British and American occupation zones to discuss increasing coal production in the Ruhr area and determining the new industrial levels of the British and American occupation zones, it was recently learned from responsible sources that the British government has rejected the US invitation. The British government would rather temporarily postpone discussing these issues until the European Economic Cooperation Conference is over.

### Differing Opinions within Japanese Cabinet on Nationalization of Coal Mines

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 15th Dispatch] The issue of national management of coal mines in Japan seems to be sufficient to affect the survival of the Katayama Cabinet. There is no complete consensus within the cabinet regarding the objects and methods of its management. Furthermore, there is a considerable distance between the proposals of the Socialist Party and the Democratic Party, and it is difficult to maintain cooperative relations with the party unless a compromise is reached. Under these circumstances, in order to seek cooperation with the party, a liaison meeting of the three factions of the party was held on the 14th, and the members of each party explained their basic opinions. Furthermore, the views of cabinet members from the Socialist and Democratic parties within the government are also different, so a compromise should be reached at this time through appropriate methods. Therefore, Nishio also participated in the liaison meeting of the three factions in the capacity of representative of the government, and it seems that considerable time will be required to reach this compromise, and it is impossible not to draw out this group meeting, otherwise it may develop into a political issue.

### MacArthur Plans to Retire to His Hometown After the Signing of the Peace Treaty with Japan

[US News Agency Washington, 14th Dispatch] Assistant Secretary of State for Administration, Fliflet, said in a speech to a small committee of the House of Representatives today that civil administration agencies may be established in the American occupation zones in Germany, Japan, and Korea, under the jurisdiction of the State Department within a period of one year or eighteen months. If this change is realized, the US military will withdraw from the occupation zones, leaving only a few guards, pending the signing of a peace treaty. Several thousand military personnel in the occupation zones will be transferred to the State Department, and some departments of the State Department will also be expanded as a result.

### Attlee Explains India Independence Bill

[Reuters London, 14th Dispatch] The House of Commons' review of the India Independence Bill has entered the committee stage. During the discussion, members requested the Prime Minister to clarify the meaning of the term "independent dominion" in the bill. Prime Minister Attlee replied that, according to the Statute of Westminster, dominion means complete independence, and declared that the wording in the India Independence Bill will not change the complete independence and autonomy of India and Pakistan.

At the beginning of the discussion, Conservative member Butler declared regarding Hyderabad. He clarified that the Conservative Party does not intend to delay the bill, but there are several points that need to be clarified. Undersecretary of the Department of India and Burma, Henderson, replied that the three island groups of Andaman, Nicobar, and Laccadive will become part of the Indian dominion. The preparation for independence of these islands must seek the opinions of other related dominion governments (the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are located in the Bay of Bengal; the Laccadive Islands are located in the Arabian Sea). Berar, under the jurisdiction of the Hyderabad state, will still belong to Hyderabad.

Hopes for Continued Cooperation After Division of Indian Army

Prime Minister Attlee further explained the division of the Indian Army, saying that it was a necessary result after the partition of India, but he hoped that the two dominions could engage in the greatest cooperation in defense affairs. He also hoped that the British officers serving in India could continue to serve, and believed that the Gurkha troops originally in the Indian Army could continue to be under British command.

### Secret Gold and Dollar Black Market Busted in Triple-Housed, Multi-Gated Den on Third Floor Next to Huiluo Company on Nanjing Road; Ten People, Including Masterminds, Accomplices, and Customers, Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] The police department's economic section yesterday busted a large-scale secret gold and dollar black market trading organization. This organization was meticulously arranged and acted cunningly, but it finally could not escape justice.

No. 88 Nanjing East Road, next to Huiluo Company at the intersection of Sichuan Road, is a three-story building. The Harris Restaurant is on the bottom floor, and the second and third floors are offices for commercial firms and companies. The staircase of this building is in the middle and never sees sunlight all year round. It is dark, winding, and quite mysterious. No. 7 on the third floor is the location of the gold and dollar organization. On weekdays, a signboard of "Hong An Securities" is hung outside the door. Unsuspecting people naturally think it is a legitimate securities firm. However, its interior is arranged like a machine, with so-called rooms within rooms and doors within doors. There are a total of five interconnected rooms. The trading place is in the innermost room, while the outer rooms are for negotiation and bargaining, and a staff member is assigned to listen to the phone and contact buyers and sellers. Transactions are made in the inner room after an agreement is reached. Customers who frequent the place are both Chinese and foreign, and they have been operating secretly for quite some time.

A week ago, the economic section of the police department received a secret report from an informant, informing them of this organization. They immediately dispatched officers to conduct a detailed follow-up investigation and confirmed the facts. Therefore, yesterday morning, Section Chief Xu Youzuo of the section led officers Shen Jialin, Jing Qinghai, and more than ten economic police officers to begin the operation. They departed from the police department at 11:30 a.m. and arrived at the location at 11:45 a.m. To avoid alarming the suspects, armed police temporarily ambushed downstairs, while plainclothes police officers, including Shen, pretended to be customers and entered No. 7 on the third floor, heading straight to the inner room. At this time, the staff in the outer room planned to ask them where they were going. Shen and others vaguely replied, "Looking for someone named Wang," while quickly rushing to the inner suite. By the time they arrived, the door to the inner suite was locked from the inside. Those trading inside had already heard the commotion outside and were frantically hiding gold and dollars in secret drawers. However, Section Chief Xu had already been watching the movements in this inner suite from another room where he could see, so it was clear where the gold and dollars were being hidden. At the same time, he called the armed police downstairs to come upstairs.

Two Telephone Lines Cut Off

At this time, the staff in the organization were extremely cunning and cut off two of the three privately installed intercom lines. The police discovered and prevented the remaining one from being cut. This intercom was extremely busy, with Chinese and Westerners constantly asking about the black market price of gold and dollars.

Under the spot search, US$4,751 in American dollars, four large gold bars, twenty-three small gold bars, three gold bracelets, twenty-one gold rings, one gold lock plate, and HK$190 in Hong Kong dollars were confiscated. In addition, three gold bracelets, one small balance scale, one diamond-studded gold plate, and one small diamond ring were found on the bodies of customers in the outer room.

Two Other Masterminds on the Run

This organization was formed by three partners: Jiang Chengqi, Huang Yaoting, and Jiang Chengliang. Huang and Jiang had already left at the time, so they were not apprehended. Mei Chengqi, the accountant Chen Lizhang, the telephone operator Ding Bingzhang, the runner Wu Guochang, customers Shen Xirong (jeweler), Xi Xianglong (trainee at the Belgian Sabena foreign firm), Du Shaoceng (clerk at the Argentine Embassy), Huang Zuhong, Lai Lesheng (trainee at the Huatai Hotel), and Zhang Gongpei were all arrested on the spot. All the suspects are currently being held in the police department's detention center for further interrogation.

It was also resolved that the Industrial Association and the City Chamber of Commerce would jointly petition the highest economic authorities to relax the application for import using self-provided foreign exchange and to relax the ban on the transshipment of goods from Guangzhou issued by the South China Branch of the Import Management Committee on July 1 this year. Finally, sixteen articles of the rules of procedure for the review of the allocation of quota raw materials were adopted.

### Yu Shuping Officially Appointed as Director; Zhang Shi Promoted to Deputy Director

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Shuping's official appointment as Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department was formally announced at yesterday's Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting. At the same time, Zhang Shi, the original Director of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, was promoted to the position of Deputy Director.

### Comprehensive Income Tax May Be Applied with Lenience

Regarding the comprehensive income tax, the Ministry of Finance has already instructed the Bureau of Direct Taxation to begin collecting it. According to the person in charge of the Bureau of Direct Taxation, the collection procedures are extremely complicated. The tax bureau must comprehensively assess an individual's salary income, bank deposit interest income, profits from investments in various enterprises, and rental income from an individual's real estate, such as properties and furniture. After deducting the individual's necessary family expenses, the bureau will then determine the amount of tax payable. This investigative procedure is extremely cumbersome, and it is difficult to ensure completeness. Therefore, to facilitate collection, the bureau plans to submit a simplified tax collection method to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The main points of the method are two: (1) Among civil servants, only senior personnel will be subject to comprehensive income tax. (2) For all general taxpayers in society, the bureau will request nominations from the Senate and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to select those with affluent lifestyles to be taxed.

### Mysterious Radio Station Specializing in Sending Secret Codes, Three Main Culprits Arrested, Accomplices at Large, Drug Use Suspicions Also Discovered

[Reported by this newspaper] The police局 recently cracked a mysterious radio station, arresting many suspects and drug users, who are currently under interrogation. The incident occurred when a police officer, on duty at a post on Zhongzheng Middle Road the other day, noticed a group of people carrying a black leather bag, looking flustered. He immediately stepped forward to inspect them and found more than 20 brown envelopes, all containing telegraphic codes (different from ordinary telegraph codes). Besides the envelopes, there was nothing else. Considering their suspicious behavior, he took them to the police局 for investigation. They identified themselves as He Rongfu from Guangdong. These letters were delivered by Feng Yuanyi from a radio station in Anlefang, Jing'an Temple Road, to Liao Xien at the radio station at 526 Zhabei Road, but he was arrested on the way. However, the contents of the codes are unknown. Subsequently, the Bureau investigated the aforementioned locations. Feng Yuanyi had already escaped, and only Liao Xien and He Hongjun, He Rongfu's father, at No. 30, Lane 359, Huashan Road, were apprehended. When searching He's home, it was discovered that He Hongjun was smoking opium. He and others were taken into custody, but the main culprit, Feng Yuanyi, is still at large, leaving the case a mystery. Whether there is political motivation or connections to underground banks is still under careful investigation by the Bureau. According to reporters' investigations, the radio station charges 5,000 yuan per word for sending telegrams on behalf of customers.

### Female Student's Startling Dream: Climbing Over the Wall and Entering a Lady's Chamber at Night, Proposing Marriage with a Gun, Kneeling in Supplication

[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Chengde, a native of Ningbo, runs the Chengtai Construction Factory at 33 Wuyi Road. His second daughter, Chen Zhizhu, 22 years old, is intelligent and beautiful, and is currently a senior at St. John's University. A young man named Zhai Wanli, a native of Rugao, lives at No. 154, a neighboring building to the north. He is 19 years old and a freshman at Soochow University. He saw the girl's beauty and was amazed by her. When they met, they would occasionally exchange a few words, but the girl was quite reserved, and he had no way to express his admiration. On the night of the 30th of last month, driven by passion, Qu, carrying a handgun, climbed over the wall and entered Zhizhu's bedroom. The girl was awakened from her dream. Zhai knelt down on both knees and proposed to Chen. Under Zhai's threat, Chen feigned agreement at the time and tricked him into handing over the gun. The next day, the girl told her parents about what happened last night and reported it to the Changning Road Police Substation, which arrested Zhai. He was sent to the local prosecutor's office yesterday for questioning by Prosecutor Ding Tongjun. According to Zhai's confession, "I really love her, so I resorted to this tactic. I carried a handgun because I thought it was very impressive. The gun belongs to Liu Jiliang. I obtained it last year from a naval friend, Wang Kaiyuan, for 300,000 yuan as collateral. It has no license and no bullets inside." He was released on bail pending trial.

### Wen Lantting's Retrial Scheduled, Ji Xizong Testifies: Serving in Pseudo-Positions Was Approved on Record

[Reported by this newspaper] Wen Lantting, one of the "Three Old Men" of Shanghai during the enemy-puppet period, was accused of being a traitor and sentenced to eight years in prison by the High Court. After review by the Supreme Court, the case was remanded for retrial because it was necessary to investigate in detail whether Wen Lantting's appointment to the pseudo-positions was approved by the Central Government in advance or submitted for approval afterward. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday. Wen Lantting was unable to attend the trial because he was seriously ill and receiving treatment at the Red Cross Hospital on Huashan Road. His defense lawyer appeared in court on his behalf. Ji Xizong, a specialist of the Central Party Headquarters, testified that he was ordered to come to Shanghai in June of the 30th year [of the Republic] to work as a commissioner of the Central Statistics Bureau stationed in Shanghai, concurrently serving as a member of the Special Party Department of both roads. He met Wen through an introduction. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he received approval from the Central Government to further engage Wen Bantting in work, mainly to provide economic intelligence. During this period, Wen served as the chairman of the pseudo-Municipal Chamber of Commerce in January of the 31st year [of the Republic], the chairman of the pseudo-Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association on May 6th of the 32nd year [of the Republic], the chairman of the Cotton Control Association in October of the 32nd year [of the Republic], and the chairman of the pseudo-Commercial Control Association in June of the 33rd year [of the Republic], all with the approval of the Central Statistics Bureau. Because Shanghai was filled with enemy influence and the situation was extremely chaotic at that time, I used his official position to cover up underground work. At the time, Wen did retain a large amount of cotton yarn materials. In May and June of the 32nd year [of the Republic], a secret radio station was set up in Wen's house to communicate secretly with the Central Government. Detailed information can be obtained by writing to the Central Statistics Bureau for verification. After Ji finished testifying, the defense lawyer stood up and said: "The defendant is very ill and needs a caretaker to assist with urination and defecation, so he is unable to attend court. Can the court send someone to question him at his bedside to facilitate an early resolution of the case?" The court ordered that the motion be submitted for consideration.

### Far East International Military Tribunal Judge, Dr. Mei Ru'ao, Passes Through Shanghai, Discusses the Truth of His Driver's Arrest

[Reported by this newspaper] Dr. Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese judge representative of the Far East International Military Tribunal, has returned to Shanghai from Nanjing after returning to China for a work report during the tribunal's summer recess. The reporter recently met with Mr. Mei at his residence and talked about the Tokyo telegram carried in domestic newspapers on the 18th of last month regarding the arrest of Mr. Mei's car driver. Although the matter was trivial and has passed, the telegram at the time was brief, and the people of the country were unclear about the truth, leading to much speculation. Some said that the arrested driver was Chinese and the arresting military police were Japanese. Some domestic newspapers even used the headline "A Strange Incident in Tokyo", which led to the spread of misinformation and deepened misunderstandings. The reporter asked Mr. Mei about the actual situation at the time. Mr. Mei smiled and said: "This was originally a minor and accidental incident, only because the Tokyo telegram was too brief and somewhat exaggerated, which caused the concern of the people of the country. Since you asked, I will tell you the actual process of what happened at that time."

Mr. Mei said: "The eleven judges of the Far East International Tribunal, although nominally appointed by Macron, are actually recommended by various countries and represent their own countries. Therefore, these eleven people form a special group in Tokyo, enjoying special honors and treatment. Each person occupies a suite in the luxurious Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, including an office, a living room, and a bedroom, all equipped with air conditioning (the only residence with air conditioning in Tokyo). In addition, each judge is also allocated a latest-model sedan car by the Allied Headquarters, with national emblem markings suspended in the front and rear. The drivers are all sergeants from the 8th Army Automobile Brigade of the US Army stationed in Japan. Mr. Mei's driver is US Army Sergeant Charles. These judges' special cars are painted with red numbers, with the President of the Court being number one, the United States being number two, China being number three, England being number four, and the Soviet Union being number five. When driving through the city, even if they violate traffic rules, the military police are not allowed to stop them halfway, but only to record their number for later negotiation. This is to respect the status of the judges and avoid obstructing their official duties."

"Since the tribunal's opening 14 months ago, the court has convened daily at 9:30 AM. The judges take cars from their residences at 9:15 AM to the court (the old site of the Ministry of the Army), which takes about 10 minutes. At 9:15 AM on June 17th, Mr. Mei planned to go to court on time, but the driver Charles was not at the residence. The waiter searched everywhere but could not find him. It was already 9:30 AM. He called the car general management office, but they also did not know where the driver was. After further inquiries to the automobile brigade to which he belonged, it was learned that Charles had violated military regulations due to a minor matter in early March. He was summoned by the US military police headquarters at 9:00 AM that day. Charles did not inform Mei or notify the general management office to send another vehicle. After learning about it, the place sent Mr. Mei to court, but it was already after 10:00 AM. To maintain etiquette, Mr. Mei informed President Webb with a note explaining the reason for his lateness after arriving at the court. Mr. Webb thought that Mr. Mei was unhappy and expressed indignation on his behalf and announced loudly in public: 'The military police headquarters summoned the judge's driver without notifying the judge, which is close to contempt of court'. At that time, the prosecutor and the defendant's lawyer were debating and were interrupted by the trial, so the small thing became big, and the telegram was spread, known to the world."

Mr. Mei continued: "This matter is very trivial and accidental, but the British and Americans are accustomed to the spirit of the rule of law and respect judges, so it is not surprising. The Chinese people mistakenly thought that Mr. Mei's driver was Chinese and that the military police were Japanese, but in fact, there are no soldiers in Japan, let alone military police, and even the police are not allowed to carry guns without the permission of the Allied Headquarters."

The International Tribunal began its six-week recess on June 27th, lasting until August 4th. Mr. Mei is scheduled to go to Japan at the end of the month and will attend a welcome meeting for the faculty and students of the Law Society of Fudan University.

### Military Service Symposium, Director Xu Addresses, Suggesting Educated Youth Join the Army to Complete the Important Task of National Construction

[Reported by this newspaper] The military service symposium hosted by the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government was held at the department's office on Tanggu Road yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Mayor Wu attended and presided over the meeting. Xu Siping, Director of the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Yin Chengzuo, Deputy Director, made a special trip from Nanjing to Shanghai to participate. After Chairman Wu reported on the significance of the symposium, Director Xu addressed the meeting, briefly stating: (1) Conscription is being carried out universally in various places this year. (2) Because Shanghai is a commercial and industrial area, the number of conscripts is relatively small. (3) Shanghai's conscription is still in its initial stages, and all preparations must be adequate, so it is later than other places, starting on August 1st. (4) The administration of military service in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas is mainly based on volunteers, with conscription as secondary. He then explained Chairman Chiang's instructions on the administration of military service, emphasizing the need to strengthen publicity efforts to ensure that every household is aware of it, and that efforts should be made to ensure fairness and strengthen the people's faith. He further explained that military service laws and regulations have been simplified, and that the military service associations in various places today are civilian organizations that assist the government in promoting military service, hoping to exert their dynamism. Xu also said: "I have suggested to the Central Government that we should launch a new campaign for educated youth to join the army to complete the important task of national construction."

### Manufacturing Fake Gold Bars, Mixing Proves Exposed, One Offender Recently Released and Arrested, One Offender Fled

Pitiable Vendors' Savings Over the Years, Purchased Counterfeit Items Without Knowing Whereabouts

[Reported by this newspaper] Xiong Wenbin, a native of Shaoxing, is 42 years old and lives at No. 201 Zhaozhou Road in the Nanshi District. He is a coal store clerk and has always been unstable. A month ago, Xiong met his friend Shi Qinghe on the road. Shi was a craftsman at a certain jewelry store. During their conversation, Shi suddenly revealed his intention to make fake gold bars to cheat money. Xiong felt that it was profitable and was delighted by the prospect. The two immediately agreed to cooperate and decided to use Xiong's home at No. 201 Zhaozhou Road as the factory.

The next day, Shi brought another craftsman and necessary tools to Xiong's home and began to manufacture. The method was to make fake lead gold inlaid with silver. The gold content was 8.8 parts, and the silver content was 1.2 parts. They first made three small gold bars, each weighing one tael. Shi took them to be stamped with hard seals. Two bars were faked to be from the Lao Tianbao Jewelry Store, and one was faked to be from the Dafengheng Jewelry Store. Because their techniques were superb, the fake gold bars were difficult to distinguish from the real ones when roughly inspected.

Once manufactured, they found a way to mix them in. First, they pawned one to Chen Yu, the son-in-law of an old lady living at No. 100 Baishoufang, Lujiabang Road, and shared the proceeds. Half a month later, they sold the remaining two bars to Lin Zhigang, who set up a fruit stall at the entrance of Yaojianong, Zhongqun Road. However, at this time, Xiong Wenbin had been detained by the local procuratorate on suspicion of another case. Both of these fake gold bars were sold by Shi Qinghe.

At this time, the 4th Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters had received a confidential report that someone was manufacturing fake gold bars and sent personnel to investigate. They learned the details, but Shi Qinghe had already fled upon hearing the news. Xiong Wenbin was released by the local procuratorate on the 12th after being detained for 13 days. At 11:00 PM on the 13th, he was arrested by inspectors from the 4th Brigade at the intersection of Xijia Road and Xundaogai. After interrogation, he confessed to the above without denial. He was sent to headquarters yesterday for investigation according to law. Shi Qinghe, who is on the run, is still being actively pursued.

The physical evidence in this case, the three fake gold bars, are not yet fully accounted for. One of them was pawned to Chen Yu, the son-in-law of Mrs. Wei. Chen did not know it was fake and pawned it to a person named Luo Shaoyi. The other two were sold to fruit vendor Lin Zhigang. Lin stopped setting up his fruit stall after buying the fake gold bars, or may have brought the gold bars bought with his savings over the years back to his hometown. If that is the case, it would be tragic.

### Soviet Evacuation Ship Unauthorizedly Carried Cargo and Passengers to Shanghai: Violates Our National Shipping Rights; Awaiting Central Government Instructions Before Deciding; First Batch of Evacuees Expected in Early August

It is learned that the formalities for the first batch of 1,000 people returning to their country will be completed within three days.

Among the passengers were six Taiwanese and two children who boarded in Dalian, as well as a British businessman. Except for the American who had a passport, the others had no supporting documents. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relevant authorities believe that it is a violation of our national shipping rights for foreign ships to carry cargo and passengers from one place to another within Chinese territory without the consent of the Chinese authorities. At the same time, the list of crew members was not approved by our consulate when the ship departed from Vladivostok to China, which is also inappropriate. However, the authorities in this city have not yet made any specific statement on this case and will make a decision after receiving instructions from the central government.

Luxurious and Splendid: Unseen in the Philippines

The "Eriklik" will carry a small number of Chinese and Soviet diplomats back to Vladivostok in the next one or two days and will return to Shanghai again at the end of this month to then transport the evacuees. This ship is a German war prize obtained by the Soviet Union during the war. It is an extremely luxurious and modern passenger ship, weighing 22,000 tons, with a capacity of approximately 2,000 passengers. The ship is well-equipped, unusually comfortable, with a dance hall, grand dining room, swimming pool, and first-class cabins with suites including rooms for living, bathrooms, and servants, much like a small apartment. It is even more luxurious than the American President's ship, which can be called one of the most impressive vessels ever seen.

Moutai Agency: Import Procedures

Before the war, import and export and customs declaration procedures for Soviet ships in Shanghai were handled by the Hongyun Company. After the resumption of navigation after the victory, it is now handled by the Transportation Department of Moutai Foreign Firm. Therefore, the import and export procedures of the "Eriklik" are also handled by this firm, while the registration of evacuation tickets is handled by the Tongjilong Foreign Firm on behalf of the Soviet Consulate General.

### Education Symposium; Only Discussed Higher Education Issues Yesterday; Decided to Extend the Meeting by Half a Day to Continue Discussion Today

The Higher Education Group was chaired by Wu Yifang. The Secondary Education Group was chaired by Cheng Shiyu. The Social Education Group was chaired by Ying Ganli.

The chairman of the Higher Education Group reported on the group meeting, followed by speeches by more than 20 people, including Wu Yifang, Ou Yuanhuai, Cha Liangjian, Yuan Dunli, Cheng Shiyu, and Yu Xiaocang. As a result, two major cases were resolved regarding higher education: (1) How to cultivate a good academic atmosphere. It was resolved that the occurrence of student unrest was due to the unrest in the current situation and the bad social atmosphere, and the responsibility does not only lie with education. In the future, all parties should actively cultivate a good academic atmosphere to eliminate student unrest, guide students onto the right track, and pay attention to the following points: (a) Increase academic interest, encourage academic research, and enrich teaching and living facilities, and improve the treatment of teachers; (b) Implement the combination of training and education. In addition to the Training Committee and the Training Department being responsible, the deans and department heads should also be responsible for training, and professors should be asked to be jointly responsible at any time; (c) When students pay attention to and study national politics, they should develop correct political concepts, cultivate a democratic style, and practice democratic procedures. However, students should concentrate on their studies during their studies and should not engage in actual political activities, let alone overstep the bounds, affecting the school and social order. The Training Committee and the Training Department should actively guide student autonomy activities, especially to arouse their sense of responsibility for their views and behaviors. (2) The issue of distinguishing between the nature of vocational schools and universities. It was resolved that: (a) Vocational schools aim to cultivate practical talents, and universities aim to study advanced academics and cultivate specialized talents. The goals are different, and the nature is naturally different. They should still be established separately according to the statutory purpose; (b) Vocational school graduates should also be awarded degrees, the names of which will be considered later; (c) At present, university education should focus on enriching content and should not be expanded without a plan or preparation. The discussion adjourned at 7 pm, and the issues of the Secondary Education, Social Education, and Comprehensive groups were not discussed. It was decided to extend the meeting by half a day and continue the discussion on the morning of the 16th before closing the meeting.

The final A division match will begin at 7:15 PM, with a contest between two strong Chinese teams, Hua Yan and Yong Sha Hong. Since the beginning of the competition, Hua Yan has two wins in two matches, forming a confrontation with the Soviet Union. Yong Sha Hong has also only lost once to the Soviet Union, so today's match is very important. Hua Yan's star player Zheng Zhiqing has not been affected since returning to Ping, and Yong Sha Hong, in order to create a balanced situation, will go all out. The main player Zheng Yiquan is expected to make a comeback and join the battle. A fierce battle is expected. Hua Yan will face the Soviet Union this Friday. After this match, the general trend will be seen at a glance. The schedule for today is recorded below:

Hua Yan vs. Jin De Blue (Women's Division) 5:30 PM

Yong Sha White vs. Russian Expatriates (B Youth) 6:15 PM

Hua Yan vs. Yong Sha Hong (A Division) 7:00 PM

### Tonight's Table Tennis Finals - Shanghai Star Faces Post A

The 16th scene of the 2nd Table Tennis League Finals will begin at 8:00 PM tonight at the Yokohama Bridge Central Hall. The match will be between the champion of Division 1, Shanghai Star, and the champion of Division 4, Post A. The referees are Li Longbiao and Chen Jimao, and the record keeper is Hu Shansheng. Over the past three weeks, the 15 finals matches have all been between the champions and runners-up of each division. Generally speaking, the champions of each division seem to be able to advance smoothly, but unexpectedly, many upsets have occurred, such as Lian Xing's big win over Post A, and Lu Team's consecutive wins over Hua Lian and Post A, proving that table tennis skills are developing rapidly. Tonight's match has entered the fourth week of the program, and the champions of each division will meet in order, and the battle will become more and more intense. Shanghai Star's dominance remains the same this season. The skills of the main players Xue Xuchu and Chuan Qifang have reached their peak. The other players are also very strong. Post A is a veteran team, but unfortunately, they have had an unfavorable start, being defeated by the two new teams of Lian Xing and Lu Team, greatly reducing their vigor. They are facing the fierce and skilled Shanghai Star tonight, and their chances of winning are slim. The names of the two teams tonight are recorded below:

(Shanghai Star) Xue Xuchu (Captain), Chuan Qifang, Wang Changhou, Yu Cheng, Cheng Aixin, Huang Zisong, Huang Zhijun, Huang Gaoyuan, Li Zongpei.

(Post A) Wang Zhuanzhang (Captain), Liu Zaoshi, Li Guangyao, Zhou Xintang, Zhuang Kunrong, Jiang Chunshan, Yu Chunrong, Zhang Qihong, Lu Zongyu.

### Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee Stipulates Supplementary Measures for Joint Yarn Allocation - Priority Allocation to Local Mills for Advance Orders from Out-of-Town Mills - Purchase Price of Yarn Spun by Executive Yuan's Flower Allocation Office Determined

[Special Dispatch] The Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee has stipulated four supplementary measures for the joint allocation and sale of cotton yarn, and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association has sent letters to its member factories to inform them. The contents of these measures are as follows: (1) Advance orders for yarn submitted by out-of-town yarn mills should be given priority for allocation to local or nearby counties for the re-manufacturing industry. Customers should hold an advance order stamped with the seal of the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee and pay the price at the business location of each factory to obtain a warehouse receipt for picking up the goods. After allocating yarn according to this principle, each factory should transport any remaining yarn to Shanghai, and first designate a delivery location. (2) During the effective period specified in the advance order, customers should complete the purchase procedures at each factory within the specified period. Failure to do so will result in the order being voided. (3) Each yarn mill should stamp the returned advance order with a stamp indicating that the warehouse receipt has been issued and the date, and send it to the Sixth District Association for record. (4) Advance order coupons for which customers have not completed purchase procedures by the deadline should be submitted by the customer to the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company for transfer to this committee for verification. Furthermore, regarding the fourth item of returning warehouse receipts, the Sixth District Association has recently sent a letter to its customers requesting that they submit a copied form to the association for verification when returning the receipts.

In addition, regarding the purchase price of yarn spun by the Executive Yuan's Flower Allocation Office in April, May, and June, the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee has calculated and determined the purchase price for each count of yarn, with each type of yarn divided into five grades for pricing. 20-count A is 6.5 million yuan, B is 6.34 million yuan, C is 6.17 million yuan, D is 6.01 million yuan, and E is 5.85 million yuan. 21-count A is 6.75 million yuan, B is 6.58 million yuan, C is 6.41 million yuan, D is 6.24 million yuan, and E is 6.07 million yuan. 22-count A is 7.06 million yuan, B is 6.88 million yuan, C is 6.72 million yuan, D is 6.53 million yuan, and E is 6.35 million yuan. 32-count A is 9.56 million yuan, B is 9.32 million yuan, C is 9.08 million yuan, D is 8.84 million yuan, and E is 8.6 million yuan.

[Further Report] The Pricing and Finished Product Sales Task Force meeting was not held yesterday due to unforeseen circumstances. It is expected that the outline of the entire yarn and cloth adjustment plan will be announced today.

### Yarn Allocation Will Be Under Unified Distribution - Rumors of Cotton Cloth Purchases Are False

[Reported by Our Newspaper] A person in charge of the re-manufacturing industry and cotton cloth business met with Mr. Liu Siying, the acting chairman of the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee, yesterday to discuss the implementation plan for adjusting the supply of yarn and cloth, to present opinions, and to request instructions on policies. It is reported that the following points were discussed.

(1) The joint allocation of cotton yarn has increased in quantity. However, the restrictions imposed by the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company due to the weak yarn source in the past have not been lifted. A request was made for a reasonable amendment. For example, there are hundreds of small factories, and the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company has not allowed them to participate in yarn allocation because of their small equipment and limited manpower. Nine re-manufacturing industry associations have submitted written proposals requesting group allocation, but they have not been approved. Taking only the Tianjin factories as an example, there are about 600 looms. Forcing them to rely on the black market is detrimental to adjustment. Furthermore, cloth factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, Wuxian, and Changshu only participated in yarn allocation last month. However, the factories in the suburbs of this city have not yet received allocation. This is also an unreasonable disparity. Mr. Liu attached great importance to this and promised to make unified distribution.

(2) In principle, there is no problem with custom spinning and weaving. However, it is hoped that the key points can be grasped for the custom weaving method. The patterns and grades of goods are inconsistent, and management is not easy. If custom weaving is carried out across the board, the government may not be able to penetrate so deeply into the private sector, and the re-manufacturing industry will have the suffering of wanting to stop but not being able to. Recently, the cotton cloth market has caused rumors of cotton cloth purchases. Public sentiment is uneasy, which is contrary to the original intention of adjustment. A request was made for clear instructions. Mr. Liu stated that the government will never do this and hoped that the industry would be informed to rest assured. Regarding the custom weaving method, due to the complexity of the matter, a more detailed discussion will be held on another day.

(3) The allocation and sale of cotton cloth will be one aspect of the adjustment measures. However, it is not the same as the Great Rear Area during the War of Resistance, with a vast area and connected trade routes. It will be difficult to be thorough with universal direct allocation and sale. Furthermore, auxiliary institutions are insufficient, and social survey statistics are lacking. What the government puts out may not necessarily be what the people receive. It is hoped that the focus will be on the big picture and that a serious effort will be made. Mr. Liu said that the trend of speculation and hoarding must be stopped. Equitable distribution and benefits must be directly accessible to the public. He promised to discuss the method in detail again and asked that industry support be conveyed in principle.

(4) The implementation plan for adjusting the supply of yarn and cloth is related to the nation's economic plan, the lifeline of industrial production, and the commercial sales standards. It is hoped that the opinions of the re-manufacturing industry and the cotton cloth industry will be valued to seek sincere cooperation between the government and business, and between production and sales. Mr. Liu expressed his pleasure at this and solemnly stated that the government is doing things for the people and is very willing for the relevant industries and businesses to have practical methods for adoption. He promised to convene a forum with the responsible persons of the yarn and cloth industry within a few days to gather wisdom and benefit from each other.

### Artificial Silk Fluctuations Minimal - Factory-Managed Silk Fabrics Are Generally Weak

Yesterday, the price of artificial silk did not change. It was weaker at the opening but recovered to a high level, similar to the previous day's price. 120-count Takayama Yuko was initially offered at 27 million yuan, and there was no lack of absorption at low prices, which led to an increase. The closing price at noon was 7.5 million yuan, and the final opening price in the afternoon was 7.8 million yuan. The prices of Toyo and Tianqiao were also no different from the previous day.

Yesterday, factory-managed silk fabrics were still weak. Although the wartime price of high uniformity was similar to the previous day, there were no transactions. Several medium-grade small lots were offered at prices between 30 million and 100 million yuan. High-grade small lots were offered at 32 million yuan, and there were also transactions. The quoted price of dry warp did not move, and there were no transactions.

Yesterday, silk fabrics were unusually soft due to falling raw material prices and limited actual sales. Bed covers and checkered crepe uniformly plummeted. The lowest price for Dachen bed covers was 1.45 million yuan, but then it improved slightly, selling for 1.55 million yuan. The lowest price for Huaqiang bed covers was 1.4 million yuan, and then it traded for 1.45 million yuan. Dachen checkered crepe opened at 37,500 yuan, and finally fell to 6,700 yuan. The next-day price was 6,900 yuan. All other goods were weak. High-end Huajin crepe traded for 25,000 yuan.

### Export Promotion Committee Discusses Silk Export Issues

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a regular meeting yesterday morning, chaired by Chen Guangfu. The issue of silk exports was discussed in detail at yesterday's meeting, but no conclusion was reached. The meeting will continue to be held from 4:00 PM this afternoon to make a final conclusion.

### Weak Cotton Market Clearing Prices

Yesterday, spot cotton transactions were scarce, and the market was very weak. The industry's sentiment was weakened due to tight money and falling yarn and cloth prices. Yesterday, yarn mills and customer associations' absorption was relaxed, and the amount of chips on the market suddenly became abundant, and prices also rebounded slightly. The price offered for delivery to factories was 2.07 million yuan for Guide cotton. The warehouse delivery price was 2.02 million yuan, 2.2 million yuan, 2.22 million yuan, 2.25 million yuan, 2.26 million yuan, and 2.27 million yuan for Lingbao cotton. Guide cotton was 1.96 million yuan, 2.03 million yuan, and 2.07 million yuan. Zhoupu seed cotton was 345,000 yuan per dan.

### Sluggish Rice Sales - Japonica and Indica Continue to Decline

Yesterday, a total of more than 3,500 piculs of rice arrived in the North and South markets, and sales were extremely sluggish. There were no buyers, and Japonica and Indica rice continued to plummet by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. White rice also fell by another 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.

Flour sales were strong, plunging by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran was also reduced by 1,000 yuan. Bean cake sales also weakened accordingly, falling back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yingkou cake plummeted by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Soybean buyers remained unmoved, and local views turned negative, falling by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

Wanzhe South Seas absorption continued, gradually soaring, rising by 10,000 yuan. Both domestic and foreign sales of broad beans were sluggish, and sources continued to arrive, falling by another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn, on the other hand, moved slightly in the North, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while medium grades remained flat.

There were very few transactions of raw peanuts, and prices fell by 10,000 yuan. Sesame was the only one that stood out, rising by another 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Garbanzo beans remained stable.

Shantou continued to fluctuate. Vegetable oil fell by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan due to the Guangzhou buyers stopping. Raw oil and soybean oil rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan as Ningbo buyers took delivery. Sesame oil remained flat, while Qing sesame oil was firm.

### Rediscount Committee Approves Loans - Total Amount 8.5 Billion Yuan

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The 16th regular meeting of the Rediscount Committee of the Central Bank was held at 3:00 PM on the 15th in the conference room of the committee. Fourteen people, including Qin Runqing, Pan Shouheng, and Wu Kejia, attended.

### Principles for Wheat Loans Changed

Some Flour Mills Change to In-Kind Loans

[Reported by Our Newspaper] It is reported that the principles for wheat loans, which have been brewing for a long time, have been determined, but approval for late transport has not been obtained. It is now heard that the original lending principles have been changed again. The main points are as follows:

(1) Wheat loans will continue to be handled as before. Except for the five major flour mills in the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, Fuxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong, the original principle was to loan 1 billion yuan to other factories with a daily output of 1,000 bags. It has now been decided to change to in-kind loans. Detailed methods are awaiting final approval at the Nanjing Joint Office meeting this Thursday.

(2) The government will separately handle wheat purchase loans of 300 billion yuan. The Grain Department will entrust flour mills in various districts to handle wheat purchases with this fund. It is heard that the five factories, including Fuxin, account for more than 50% of the 300 billion yuan loan.

(3) The Gongji Office is a joint organization of the five factories, including Xin, and acting as an agent for the Grain Department to purchase wheat is part of the office's business.

### Securities Firm Registration - Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders to Stop

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the Shanghai Securities Commercial Association has issued an order stating that the nature of securities firms is to apply for registration with social organizations in accordance with the Company Law or the Commercial Registration Law. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to state that the association has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and that securities firms are engaged in business operations. Except for brokers who have been approved by the Shanghai Securities Exchange, who can apply for registration in accordance with the Company Law or the Commercial Registration Law, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has not approved the registration of brokers who are not securities exchanges but are engaged in the above business. If the reports are true, the registration of non-broker securities firms should be suspended, pending proper planning before further instructions are issued.

### Cigarettes Continue to Fall Broadly

Yesterday, the cigarette market was filled with selling cries, and buyers hesitated. Some buyers sought to enter at low prices, but buying interest was not strong, leading to a sharp decline in the market. In the afternoon, it was also heard that China Tobacco Company would also distribute "Quanlu Axe" brand cigarettes, and the market situation became even more downstream. As a result, ten-pack British cigarettes continued to fall sharply by 420,000 yuan per case compared to the previous day, falling to 8.32 million yuan. Old Knife cigarettes also fell sharply by 320,000 yuan to 7.18 million yuan. Five Flowers also fell by more than 100,000 yuan. The prices of other merchant cigarettes, such as Mei Li Jin Shu, Quanlu, Double Axe, Brandy, and Red Gold, all fell uniformly by 800 to 2,500 yuan per carton. Fifty-pack Jialike and Three-Five cigarettes also fell by 1,500 to 2,500 yuan per tin. However, the prices of American cigarettes, such as Morris, Six-Root, and Camel, remained stable due to the lack of supply.

### The Stock Market in China Remains Stable: Yong Yarn Experiences Initial Weakness but Recovers

The China stock market showed some fluctuations yesterday. Yong Yarn shares initially struggled and appeared to be on the verge of collapse. Retail investors engaged in short selling early in the day but covered their positions before the close, resulting in mixed gains and losses. Xinyi and Maya shares, driven by competition between the yarn and stock certificate groups, were actively traded and experienced significant gains, likely due to the potential for increased stock bonuses. Among the smaller stocks, only Xinguang showed activity, while the rest remained stable. Among miscellaneous stocks, Xin Ya experienced the largest drop, while the others showed mixed performance. Overall, the stock market initially weakened due to tight credit conditions but stabilized as credit eased.

In the morning, the market opened lower due to significant differences in interbank lending rates from the previous day, causing anxiety among investors. When trading of Yong Yarn shares began, there was a large volume of supply, causing the price to fall to 98.50 yuan. Although the price was later pulled up to 103.00 yuan, shares numbered 185, 156, 76, and 36 were sold again at 101.00 yuan. Shares numbered 223, 71, 219, and 171 were bought continuously, showing some struggle, while shares numbered 85, 76, 65, 157, 69, and 102 were sold again at 99.50 yuan. Shares numbered 177, 85, and 129 were bought on the dip, while share 117, despite frequent short selling, easily rose to around 111.00 yuan. Eventually, at 11:00 AM, Yong Yarn shares fell to 97.00 yuan due to aggressive selling by shares numbered 117, 104, 102, 50, 153, 12, 223, and 169. However, trading in Yong Yarn shares was thin, with the lowest price only reaching 97.00 yuan. Subsequently, Xinyi shares were aggressively bought by shares numbered 224, 14, and 162, causing a sudden surge, and Maya shares also quickly rebounded after being bought by shares numbered 231 and 91. Investor sentiment quickly turned positive, and Yong Yarn shares were bought by shares numbered 157, 105, 2231, 180, 177, 154, 73, and 218 to reach 102.50 yuan. Shares numbered 157, 223, 117, and 172 briefly sold small amounts at 99.80 yuan, while shares numbered 231, 117, 185, 156, 65, 223, 14, 152, 183, and 203 actively bought in. Share 230 even bought cash Yong Yarn shares, causing the price to rise to a high of 104.80 yuan and 102.30 yuan at 12:15 PM. After shares numbered 218, 169, 82, and 232 sold off, share 171 also offered cash Yong Yarn shares, causing a slight retreat to around 102.50 yuan. The market closed at 103.20 yuan at noon, and bid prices remained stable after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, spot Yong Yarn shares, Xinguang, and Qinxing shares rose slightly. China France shares remained flat, while Hua Feng and Jingfu shares declined slightly. Xinyi and Maya shares each rose by more than 50%, while Yonggong shares fell by 50%, Xin Ya shares fell by 10%, and Lianan shares fell by 50%. Wuhe Innerwear shares declined slightly. Datong Cement and Tongyi shares remained flat, while China Silk, Jing Car, and Match shares rose slightly. Commerce and Rongfeng shares each rose by around 50%. In Shanghai-traded shares, Xinyi rose by more than 50%, Maya rose by 50%, and Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing shares rose slightly. Yong Yarn and Yonggong shares declined slightly, while Hua Feng shares fell slightly. Off-market old shares such as Dasheng, Huashang, and Huacheng rose by 50%, while the rest remained stable.

### Government Bonds Experience Another Decline; Foreign Stocks Show Mixed Performance

Government bonds declined again yesterday after the Chamber of Commerce's proposal for repaying government bonds at multiple times their face value was rejected by the Ministry of Finance, causing a shock to investor confidence. However, there was still some buying interest after the decline. Unified C bonds opened at 68.00 yuan in the morning, reached a high of 71.00 yuan, a low of 65.00 yuan, and closed at 68.00 yuan. Rund and Room 503 offered supply, while Rooms 552 and 358 selected. Trading volume was around 2 million. As a result, compared to the previous day, Class A, B, and D bonds each fell by 700 yuan, Unified C bonds fell by 1,000 yuan, and Unified E bonds also fell slightly by 900 yuan.

Foreign stocks showed mixed performance yesterday. Yisha opened at 7 and rose to 71500 yuan to close. Although foreign buyers acquired, the concentration of funds from Northern banks and gangs was not large. Compared to the previous close, paper stocks rose slightly and generally reported slight declines. Trading was sluggish, and the process was 10,000 yuan, with the lowest price being 69,000 yuan, split between Ping Tang.

### First Silkworm Cocoon Loan of the Year: Over 8.8 Billion Yuan for Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces; Shanghai Region to Begin Signing Contracts This Morning

The China Farmers Bank's first round of spring cocoon silk reeling loans for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is estimated to be 8.87576 billion yuan, covering 77 manufacturers, including 24 in Zhejiang, with a total loan amount of 4.1008 billion yuan; 46 in Wuxi, with a total loan amount of 3.488904 billion yuan; 3 in Suzhou, with a total loan amount of 617.28 million yuan; and 4 in Shanghai, with a total loan amount of 668.64 million yuan.

The highest loan amount is over 860 million yuan, and the lowest is 15 million yuan. The bank has issued notices to its branches in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places on the 15th to process the loans immediately, and the Shanghai region is scheduled to begin signing contracts on the morning of the 16th.

Silk Reeling Trade Association Schedules Meeting to Discuss Important Matters

[Our Reporter] The Third District Silk Reeling Industry Association is scheduled to hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Bank Club at 3:00 PM today. It is reported that the meeting will focus on the following two items: (1) The Wuxi County Council's request to replace the person in charge of the local silkworm cocoon production and sales association. During the handling of this year's spring silkworm purchase, the association decided on the rice price based on the ratio of four dans of rice for one dan of cocoons. However, the rice price fluctuated during the purchase, causing significant losses to silkworm farmers. They are now unanimously requesting compensation and the replacement of the person in charge of the silk cocoon guidance association stationed in the county. The meeting will discuss solutions.

(2) This year's spring cocoon processing factories originally hoped that the authorities would allow them to deduct 10% for their own original advances and 10% for legal profits from the raw silk processed, and actually pay 80% of the total silk reeling amount. However, this request has been rejected by the Four Joint Offices and will also be submitted for discussion.

### Customs Fees Increase Fourfold

[Our Reporter] The Jianghai Customs has announced that, starting today, all customs fees (including miscellaneous fees at this port) will be collected at four times the current amount.

### Foreign Tea Merchants Active; Export of Tianzong Fine Eyebrow Tea

[Our Reporter] According to tea magnate Mr. Zhu, China's tea exports to France and Morocco each year are considerable, but due to the inverted price differential between domestic and foreign sales, exports have long been sluggish and unable to flourish. Recently, the French-owned Yongxing Foreign Firm in this city, in order to actively expand its market, has been selling overseas regardless of cost. It is reported that they have already negotiated the sale of 900 tons of Fine Eyebrow green tea to that region, with delivery expected by mid-August at the latest. The price is extremely low, at only about 47 cents per pound in US dollars.

[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 14th] Zhejiang tea sales had previously stalled due to prices being below cost, leading to factory closures. It is now learned that the French-owned Yongxing Foreign Firm plans to export large quantities to Morocco, so the market price has increased to over 400,000 yuan. Tea merchants' request for an additional 180,000 yuan subsidy from the China Trust Bureau has failed, so they are now trending towards free trade. Last year's tea stocks can now be sold, and tea merchants are optimistic, so tea factories have generally resumed operations.

[Another Report] Recently, in the foreign tea market, in addition to special grade, Fine Eyebrow, and tribute green teas being sold actively, local exporters have also been inquiring about low-grade black teas and scented teas, causing the market to gradually become more active and sentiment to improve. However, transactions remain sparse as sellers insist on their prices. As for various domestic sales teas, sales continue to be strong, and the market is stable with little movement, with a continuing positive outlook.

### Golden Needle Mushrooms Decline in Price

Since the new golden needle mushrooms entered the market, there have been continuous arrivals, but sales have been slow, causing prices to gradually decline. Goods previously priced at 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan are now selling for less than 900,000 yuan, a drop of more than 30%.

Buyers Wait and See, Bulls Sell Off; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Plunge; 42-count Blue Phoenix Falls Below 20 Million

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a sudden tightening of credit, causing buyers to wait and see. Bulls sold off one after another, and news that the Shenxin Factory had released 20-count Double Horse yarn further dampened sentiment, causing the market to continue to decline. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell below the 20 million mark, reaching a low of 18.7 million yuan, a sharp drop of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn also fell slightly to 12 million yuan, a drop of 800,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn was 10.9 million yuan, also down 800,000 yuan. The remaining 16-count Guangming Tiannv, 10-count Tong and Jun, and 32-count Blue Phoenix Silver Moon and other coarse and fine yarns all fell by varying amounts of 200,000 to over 1 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was also affected by tight credit conditions, with large off-market players selling off. In addition, the general floating bulls were concerned that the authorities were strictly investigating warehouses, causing small white cloths to plunge by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Furthermore, the Textile Construction Company's cloth sales had a large amount of chips, resulting in an oversupply in the market and further weakening market sentiment. As a result, 12-pound Longtou, Wufu, Blue Chicken, and Yanghe fine cloths all fell by 17,000 to 25,000 yuan. Bleached cloth and yuan serge also fell by over 10,000 yuan, while dark-colored cloth, blue cloth, and shilin cloth markets remained stable.

### Textile Construction Company Cloth Sales

[Our Reporter] The China Textile Construction Company sold a total of 10,120 bolts of cloth yesterday, as usual, with a total of 309 purchase orders. 18 manufacturer customers purchased 1,320 bolts, and 291 cloth dealers purchased 8,800 bolts.

### Soap Sales Increase, Prices Decline

Yesterday's daily necessities market saw a sharp decline. The initial asking price for Huang Xiangmao soap was 340,000 yuan, but there were few buyers. The selling pressure increased at noon, and the price fell to 335,000 yuan, with some fellow traders engaging in mutual transactions. Trading was even more sluggish in the afternoon market. As a result, Xiangmao soap fell to 325,000 yuan, a drop of 16,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Guben soap also fell slightly to 470,000 yuan, a drop of 20,000 yuan. Jiandao soap fell by 15,000 yuan to 460,000 yuan. The remaining Guanghua, Niupai, Dingfeng, and other soaps all fell by 5,000 to 45,000 yuan.

The match market also declined, and trading was exceptionally thin. Meili, Fenghuang, Nanjing, Ningbo, and other brands all saw declines of 20,000 to 40,000 yuan.

### Government Procurement of Export Goods: Determined Not to Unduly Suppress Prices

Exporters Often Unwilling to Provide Actual Costs

[Our Reporter] After the Central Trust Bureau began purchasing tung oil and bristles on behalf of the government, the general sentiment in the local export community was that the purchase prices were too low. At the same time, they hoped for two things: (1) Do not purchase in the production areas domestically; (2) Continue to entrust or resell to exporters for export, so as to maintain the business operations of general exporters.

Yesterday, a reporter consulted a person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau on this matter. The person said that the Central Trust Bureau is carrying out the government's orders and has no subjective opinions on the purchase itself. The purchase prices are determined by the Purchase and Export Commodities Price Review Committee, which carefully consults and decides on the basis of accurate quotations from various places every day, so there is absolutely no undue suppression of prices. Furthermore, national banks and bureaus are doing their best to facilitate the financing of domestic and foreign transportation and sales of export commodities. For example, exporters can first obtain acceptance when purchasing in production areas, and can also handle mortgage lending when export commodities are being transported to various export commodity distribution centers, and can also handle packaging loans when exporting. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that all the funds used in the transportation and sale of export commodities are provided by national banks and bureaus. However, general exporters are unwilling to provide the actual costs of export commodities. Even when financing is urgently needed due to inconvenient capital turnover, they insist that market prices be used as the standard. Otherwise, they will hold onto the goods and not sell them in order to obtain windfall profits from occasional exchange rate changes. Therefore, he hopes that all exporters can start from the perspective of using government funds in the past, and they will naturally not regard the current purchase prices set by the government as unreasonable. As for the two suggestions made by exporters to have exporters act as agents for foreign sales, the Central Trust Bureau is very willing to consider them and is currently being discussed by relevant parties.

### Inside Story of the Zhen'an Bloodshed: County Magistrate Sentenced to Death for Breaking the Law

— Our Reporter Mai Ye

Airmail from Xi'an, 9th

A Great Tragedy of Five Lives

"The County Magistrate notified all agencies: It has been reported that more than a dozen communists are engaged in activities in the city recently, curfew tonight." ... "The County Magistrate said that there are many communist and democratic league members in the county, you must be careful." ... "Around 5 PM, sentries were posted on the streets, and no one could move." ... "Extra guards were all over the streets, and the County Magistrate's guards were all in plain clothes." ... "The County Magistrate notified the guards to set up machine guns around the county seat, and ordered shooting in the city, no movement, no one allowed to pass." ... (The central figure was Sun Junbo, then the County Magistrate of Zhen'an County, Southern Shaanxi. The time was May 1st.)

The Shadow of the Net Slipping Through at Court, Sun Junbo First Spoke Eloquently of "Revolution One," then Recounted the Romance of the Austrian Princess. Conclusion: "If I am found guilty, I will commit suicide in court." Sun refused to be photographed by anyone, and the courtroom was very dark, so this is the only "shadow of the net slipping through," obtained by the reporter through effort. (Sent by Our Reporter Mai Ye)

A Tense Scene Simultaneously, "Armed guards were stationed around the residence of Li Weihan, (Chairman of the Zhen'an County Council)," "The Chairman (several duties, one after another (went out from home) to observe, but were prohibited from moving by the County Magistrate's guards," "Senator Zhu Benlian came out of Li's house, and was also forbidden at the door," "The County Magistrate said to his three guards, Don't let these four (forbidden at the Chairman's door) move, if they move, shoot them!" ...

Another Scene: "The Chairman (in the house) finished eating, took a cigarette, and went to stroll on the street, just arrived at the door, heard the County Magistrate's guards say: "Don't move, the County Magistrate's orders!" Then the County Magistrate came, slapped the Chairman twice, the County Magistrate fired a shot, and said "Why don't you (referring to the guards) fire?" The Chairman ran backwards, and a pile of blood flowed in front of the back door, and he collapsed in the vegetable garden." At this time, "Guards fired randomly from all sides." "When the County Magistrate fired, shots rang out from all around, as if one call brought a hundred responses." Among the four people forbidden in front of the door, a certain worker named Zhang Dongcheng was shot to death, Senator "Zhu Benlian was shot in the left leg and escaped into a civilian residence, fortunately preserving his life." "(The Chairman's) worker Wang Dekun (from home) fled to a mile outside the South Gate, and the County Magistrate ordered people to chase and shoot him." ...

Furthermore, at that time, "County Council Secretary Wan Wuying heard gunshots from within the council, and saw police officers swarming in, so he fled to a certain civilian residence, the County Magistrate ordered the Police Chief to lead police to search Wan's house without success, and then searched civilian residences everywhere, and finally captured Secretary Wan, tied him up and brought him to the County Government, and then dragged him to Chairman Li's residence. At around 9 PM, the County Magistrate ordered (Wan) to be dragged to Chairman Li's corpse to be shot!"

Four Dead, One Injured

——This is how the Zhen'an bloodshed of four deaths and one injury occurred. To ears long numbed by news of chopping and killing, four lives may not be "stimulating" enough, "Sun Junbo, as the County Magistrate, is responsible for guiding democracy, should respect public opinion to lay the foundation for constitutional governance, but instead used his power to shoot and kill Li Weihan, the head of the representative body, and Secretary Wan Wuying, etc., should be given an aggravated punishment according to the law." These few aphorisms in the verdict can be supplemented by the lament of Judge Xu Zhiyuan: "The occurrence of this bloodshed is not only the misfortune of the victims, but also the misfortune of the nation, which is preparing for constitutional governance!" Therefore, the malice of his crimes, its background, its breeding ground, its conditions, and even its teachings, all deserve attention.

Multi-Angle Grinding

Of course, the sensational point of this case, and in reality the fuse of the bloodshed, lies in the existence of a 26-year-old female teacher, Wang Huimin. Sun said that his "marriage" with her was legal, but those who witnessed the "ceremony" said it was no more than a declaration of cohabitation, and the judge used even clearer words in the indictment and judgment: "Rape." No matter what, she lived "in cohabitation" in the County Government for two months and died of poisoning, adding a "sexual tragedy" to this era's tragedy. But this interlude was not solely performed by her. Like Jin Ba's existence without appearing in Cao Yu's "Sunrise," Lu Ling or Wang Min's fate was clearly due to coercion. Inside and outside the courtroom, we heard enough on one hand of blaming bureaucratic politics, and on the other of cursing local bullies and evil gentry; parents blaming others for poisoning their daughters, and the "son-in-law" satirizing the "father-in-law" for wanting to sell his daughter, and even wanting to demand 800 million yuan for her death. Although the events are complex and subtle, when combined, they are nothing more than the conflict between officials and gentry, plus the multi-angle grinding between paternal power and "husband" power, which are equally limitless. Thus, including her, five lives were sacrificed without words!

Sexual Crime Case Transformed

This was originally at most a sexual crime case, but it quickly transformed. Because at that time, people in Zhen'an used various names to expose Sun's corruption and illegal acts to the Shaanxi Provincial Government; another case said that Sun had forced Wang Xiaolan to divorce Jia Zishan; and Wang Huimin's father also accused Sun and the Fan couple of abduction and murder in court. These cases, when combined, were indeed quite shocking. Furthermore, because the Zhen'an County Council and the province's senators in the county unanimously revealed Sun's behavior; and the documentary evidence that Wang was divorced due to Sun's pressure was said to have been forced by Chairman Li to have the witness sign and seal, Sun deeply hated the County Council and the few central figures who opposed him.

Murderous Trap

At the end of April, the Provincial Government agreed to the request of the Zhen'an County Council and sent a special commissioner, Ma Zhuoran, to Zhen'an to secretly investigate on the ground. If he had handled it well, things would not have deteriorated so badly. Unexpectedly, before he entered the county, County Magistrate Sun knew about it and sent a special person out of the city to greet him respectfully. After arriving in the city, he sent people in the name of protection, but in reality to monitor him, and also met with Ma every night to provoke and instigate him. Sun very cleverly said: "Chairman Li wants to assassinate you, Commissioner Ma," who would have thought that Ma would indeed fall into Sun's trap and turn into a joint hatred of Chairman Li and Secretary Wan? Things had reached this point, "Sun Junbo realized that Ma could help him with his plan to kill people, and became even more active." He first fabricated martial law on April 30 as preparation for the killing. At 5 PM the next day, Sun and Ma went to find the Chairman together, Sun fired the first shot at the Chairman in front of Li's residence, and Inspector Ma was also present. The judge sentenced Ma as an accomplice to murder, based on these points. Sun's actions that afternoon were, of course, stimulated by receiving the telegram from the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs suspending him from duty and awaiting investigation due to the case at noon that day.

Private Shackling

Female Lead Wang Huimin Arrives in Zhen'an

Wang Huimin was originally in Xi'an, Sun Junbo claimed that she was his ten-year lover, and she went to Zhen'an in December of this year in response to an invitation to "marry." At that time, her parents did not seem to completely oppose the marriage, but only advocated "conditional retention." These two points are not very important, and there is no solid evidence after the fact, but the two characters, Fan Weishi and his wife Zhang Tianzhen, were inserted in between. Fan was the then head of the Preparatory Division of the Zhen'an Youth League. He wrote a letter entrusting his wife to deliver it to Wang Huimin, saying that a position as female youth leader was left vacant, and asking Wang to come to Zhen'an. The letter said: "County Magistrate Sun is my classmate, and our relationship is very harmonious. I am like a second master, and there is nothing I cannot do." "Zhen'an will become our paradise."

Wang indeed went to Zhen'an with Sun, and bought wedding supplies in Xi'an before leaving, but she happened to forget to buy a marriage certificate! Upon arrival, "This woman slept with the County Magistrate on the first day, and the guards said that the County Magistrate had brought his wife" (partner testimony). A "wedding ceremony" was held the next day, which the judge later considered an illegal wedding. Pitifully, this County Magistrate's "wife" was "not free to go out" from then on; "There were guards at the bedroom door"; Letters sent to the "wife" 'must first be given to the guards, and clerks were not allowed to enter.' After two months of dragging on like this, this "First-Class Madam" (the satirical term used by Sun's defense lawyer) finally committed suicide by swallowing poison! Did she take it herself? Or was she forced to take it? There is currently no evidence. The judge ruled definitively: 'Her poisoning was indeed caused by rape, and therefore she committed suicide out of shame and anger, which is highly certain.' Even more pitiful is that the daughter died in Zhen'an, and the father, still in the dark, wrote a letter asking her to return to Xi'an for the wedding ceremony!

Another small matter can also show Sun's character: The day before the bloodshed, a Zhen'an telegraph bureau staff member sent a telegram from Xi'an to Chairman Li that seemed to contain innuendo, and Sun shackled the messenger and detained him for more than ten days. This is the third charge that the prosecutor charged Sun with in addition to murder and rape leading to death: unlawful detention, depriving people of freedom.

Sun Junbo Declared, "I Will Commit Suicide if Sentenced to Death," Did Not Fast After Hearing the Sentence But Wanted to Live

After one interrogation hearing and three debate hearings, the Xi'an District Court announced on the 7th of this month: "Sun Junbo abused his official authority and jointly committed murder, sentenced to death, deprived of political rights for life. Abused his official authority, raped, causing the victim to commit suicide out of shame and anger (referring to Wang Huimin's death), sentenced to 12 years of fixed-term imprisonment, deprived of political rights for 10 years. Abused his official authority to unlawfully detain and deprive others of freedom of movement (referring to the detention of the telecommunications bureau staff member), sentenced to 1 year of fixed-term imprisonment, shall be executed with the death penalty, deprived of political rights for life. Yang Xutang and Yang Baojun (both Sun's guards) jointly committed murder, sentenced to death, deprived of political rights for life. Ma Zhuoran (Provincial Government Inspector), Luo Zhen, Zhang Zhizhong (these two were also Sun's guards) jointly committed murder, each sentenced to 10 years of fixed-term imprisonment, deprived of political rights for 10 years. Fan Weishi (Head of the Preparatory Division of the Zhen'an Youth League) jointly intended to abduct a woman for adultery, sentenced to 3 years of fixed-term imprisonment, deprived of political rights for 3 years. Zhang Tianzhen (Fan's wife) and Han Shijun are innocent. One Browning pistol and 15 bullets confiscated."

When questioned in court, Sun declared, "If I am found guilty, I will commit suicide in court." His attitude was stubborn, and he actually scared all of the plaintiff's defense lawyers into walking out of the courtroom. That day, he did not appear in court for the verdict. He complained to reporters in prison, and also said that he would fast to apologize to the people. But in fact, he did not completely fast, but his appetite was severely reduced in a state of hysteria. He is preparing to appeal in order to seek "life"!

No matter what kind of person Wang Huimin's father is, the reporter believes that his words are quite objective: "How the Zhen'an bloodshed is sentenced is no longer my personal problem of whether I can avenge my daughter. It is truly a touchstone between the spirit of the rule of law and bureaucratic politics."

### New Review of the United Nations' Two-Year Work

July 8th, Shanghai United Translation

The world is changing rapidly, with new developments in certain locations appearing almost daily as newspaper headlines. This has been especially true in the two years since the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco on June 26, 1945, and Japan was about to surrender. Before modern history adds new records, we will review the significant developments of the past two years. This review must proceed according to the organization and growth of the United Nations, as the United Nations is the international body responsible for addressing the most pressing issues of our time.

Introduction

Never before in history has there been an international organization as vast in scale and scope as the United Nations. The massive structure outlined in the Charter has now taken shape and is functioning. The sheer volume of international discussions that have taken place is unprecedented. In New York alone, over two thousand meetings have been held in the past year. This fact in itself may be the primary achievement of the United Nations—enabling politicians from various countries to discuss their problems face-to-face, with the world as their audience.

However, it is only natural for the world to demand more concrete results. Two years is a short period, merely a blink of an eye in history. But the world's needs are extremely urgent, as humanity is at a critical juncture in its destiny, and the major decisions affecting human fate cannot be delayed.

The establishment of the United Nations aims to achieve multiple goals. To use a common saying, the mission of this collective organization of sovereign states is to save humanity and make life worthwhile. As stipulated in Article 1 of the Charter, these goals are: to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly relations among nations; to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character; and to be a center for coordinating the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.

In less than two years, what work has the United Nations actually done to achieve these goals? It is impossible to review every task that has already begun or will soon be initiated. However, the following will demonstrate the organization's major responsibilities and the results achieved to date.

Security Council Handling Of

The First Major Event

Was the Iranian issue. The Iranian government complained to the Security Council, accusing the Soviet Union of interfering in its internal affairs and violating the 1942 Treaty of Alliance by stationing troops in Iranian territory, stating that this situation could lead to international friction. The Security Council raised this issue on January 19, 1946, and discussed it in London and New York. It was not until Iran reported that Soviet troops had withdrawn that the Security Council ceased discussion of the matter on May 22, 1946, but it still "retains this issue."

A few days later, the Security Council began its work when the Soviet Union brought the situation in Greece to the attention of the Security Council, stating that the continued presence of British troops in Greece implied interference in that country's internal affairs. After two Security Council meetings and statements from both parties, the Security Council considered the matter closed.

In August 1946, the Greek situation became a problem again when Ukraine complained to the Security Council that the policies of the Greek government threatened peace. The Security Council held twelve meetings to continue discussing the complaint, but all four resolutions proposed were rejected on September 20, and the issue was removed from the Security Council's agenda.

In December 1946, the Greek issue was raised again in the Security Council, this time by the Greek government, accusing Greece's neighbors—Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia—of aiding guerrillas in northern Greece in fierce fighting, thereby endangering public order and Greek territorial sovereignty. After lengthy discussions, with several heated debates, the Security Council unanimously resolved on December 19 to establish a Balkan Investigation Committee to determine the facts of the alleged violations along the borders of Greece and the other three countries.

### Reader Consultation

Legal Translation Questions

(1) Inheritance Without Descendants

He Zhongyi asks: My mother has two aunts, the elder married a Xue, and the younger married a Zhou. The younger aunt had no children. The uncle died in 1944. At that time, because there were no direct blood relatives, lineal nephews, brothers, or parents, the entire funeral was handled by the younger aunt, and her assets were also managed by the younger aunt. Now, because the aunt is getting older and her spirit is declining, and she has no one to accompany her, she intends to adopt her elder sister's daughter, Xiuying, as her adopted daughter. Please advise: (1) Can the younger aunt legally inherit her husband's estate after his death? (2) If she can inherit this estate, does it become the younger aunt's private property? (3) Can the younger aunt legally designate an heir? (4) If she can designate, are there gender restrictions on the designated person? (5) If there is no gender restriction, can a married woman be designated? (6) If so, what procedures are required legally? Is it necessary to file with the local court? (7) Are these designated actions subject to the Zhou family's restrictions?

[Lawyer Jiang Bingfan's reply] (1) The spouse can inherit the husband's estate. (2) Property inherited is naturally the private property of the individual. (3) You can designate an heir. (4) There is no gender restriction on designating an heir. (5) A married woman can be designated as an heir. (6) There are no specific legal procedures, and there is no basis for applying to the court for recordation. (7) The act of designating an heir is not subject to others' restrictions.

(2) Property Dispute

Jian asks: Mr. Jia is over seventy years old. His first wife bore him one son and two daughters. The two daughters died after marriage and both had children. The eldest son died the year after he got married. He has a posthumous daughter who is now an adult. Mr. Jia's second wife is still alive and has a son who is also married and has children. Now, due to family discord, the eldest daughter-in-law, Yi, wants to divide the family property, but Jia does not agree. Jia has jewelry worth over a thousand yuan, deposited in two firms under the name of the eldest daughter-in-law. There are two deposit books. In 1937, Jia withdrew the money to engage in commerce without Yi's knowledge, but the deposit books are still in Yi's possession. Please advise: (1) Can Yi demand an immediate division of property? (2) Can Yi use the deposit books to claim the deposit from the two firms?

[Lawyer Jiang Bingfan's reply] (1) Because Jia is still alive, inheritance has not yet begun, and a division cannot be claimed. (2) Yi can demand the money withdrawn from Jia, and cannot directly claim the debt from the bank.

### New Information on the Biography of Hudson

— Zhao Jingshen

William Henry Hudson, the British biologist and writer, died in 1922. His childhood was spent on the South American plains, where he studied the region's animals and plants. In 1885, he wrote the two-volume novel "The Purple Land." In 1892, he wrote "The Naturalist at La Plata" (note: this area is in Argentina). His famous work is "Green Mansions: A Romance of the Tropical Forest" (note: this book is available in the Modern Library series), which discusses his knowledge of birds and animals and the magic of the Celts. In 1925, Prime Minister Baldwin built a bird sanctuary in Hyde Park in his memory, and Jacob Epstein sculpted a symbolic statue for him.

There are contradictions in Hudson's works. The biographical portion revealed in his works can be said to be both abundant and scarce. Each of his books contains autobiographical chapters, often plagued by homesickness, recalling the bird songs of years ago or the endless years on the South American plains. But these memories are timeless; they are unrelated to the calendar and can belong to any dawn or summer within a long period of time. Hudson is both rich and stingy; his memories are vivid and charming, which is richness; his events lack definite locations, which is stinginess.

Hudson rarely wrote the dates on his letters. His friends were also unable to know his year of birth. In his later years, he seemed to focus on the beauty of the land he loved, wanting to forget the passage of time. As a result, the events of his past became a secret. Morley Roberts, the friend who wrote his biography, could only guess the year he went from his birthplace to England, and still guessed wrong by four years. There are many missing years and blanks in Hudson's biography.

Hudson's adolescence to adulthood was around 1860, when he lived in Argentina. He went from South America to England in 1880, during which time he had been to Patagonia. If we are willing to take the trouble, we can find an exact date in the annual report of the Smithsonian Institution: in 1866, Hudson collected specimens in Buenos Aires. Three years later, Hudson paid for bird skins, but there are no records after 1870.

After World War II, someone visited Dr. A. Wetmore, a clerk at the Smithsonian Institution, who mentioned finding eight letters in the archives, six of which were written by Hudson. These letters had been hidden for eighty years and have only now come to light.

Two days after Christmas in 1865, Hinton Rowan Helper, the American Consul in Buenos Aires, wrote a letter to Dr. S.F. Baird of the Smithsonian Institution, introducing the young Hudson to him as the Assistant Secretary of the Institution. At that time, he was twenty-five years old, from which we know that Hudson was born in 1841 and lived to be eighty-three years old. Helper was also a famous figure at the time. His anti-slavery "The Impending Crisis," published in 1857, sold widely. His letter said, "Hudson is an aesthetically minded ornithologist who wishes to be employed to collect birds. He says himself that he can satisfy anyone who employs him, and I believe him. He says that he has collected for his own amusement but has not yet served the public. He wishes to serve your institution or any museum, American or otherwise. I would like to act as a faithful intermediary for both parties."

Baird's reply stated that he "would like to see the birds collected by Hudson and help him arrange them." He pointed out which small birds would be of the greatest scientific interest, and the letter was dated February 2, 1866.

More than a year later, Hudson's reply reached Baird, on February 12, 1867. The letter was written on September 5 of the previous year, in Conchhas, about twelve miles from Buenos Aires, where he grew up and lived at the age of sixteen. From the newly discovered letters, we know that Hudson lived there around the age of sixteen.

Of Hudson's six letters, the first is the longest and most interesting, saying, "Mr. Helper showed me the letter you gave him, asking me to collect birds. I had hoped to have two or three hundred types before September, but I was disappointed; I wanted to collect winter birds, which are rare in this season. I traveled many miles and did not find a single specimen. The birds I sent are still those I collected before, mostly known to biologists. It is too early to collect summer birds, and I don't think I will collect anything in two or three weeks, so I have to present what little I have. I don't believe these things will reach you completely undamaged because I don't have the experience for this kind of work; but even if there is a loss, it may not be too much. I hope to send you more specimens when your next letter arrives. I want to try to get ostrich eggs and a box of snail shells, of which I believe there are only four types in this city. Because you did not mention writing bird names, I only marked the male and female of each type on the edge of the wrapping paper; but if you need it, I can make a description of each type in the future, adding its habits. These birds were all shot by me with a gun within eight miles of the city of Buenos Aires. You say that small birds are best for scientific use. If I search carefully, I can find a lot of small birds in the Ze Lin Nong along the river, some of which I am afraid have never been known before. You must know the geographical state of Buenos Aires, which is a wide, almost treeless plain, where birds and animals have no shelter from the cold winter winds or the scorching summer winds. So this place is not suitable for collecting, purely for the sake of loving nature, I hope to change to another place. I will use all my time to pursue this work. In addition to birds, I am also willing to collect fossils, insects, grasses, etc."

Hudson said that there are only four types of snails in Argentina, but there are nearly four hundred types. His second letter was dated June 1867, mentioning that there was a "blackbird" in the paper box, sent with the bird skin. He hoped that Baird would examine it carefully; he was convinced that this was a previously undiscovered new specimen. Nine months passed. In his fourth letter (the location is still Conchhas, the date is March 15, 1868), we heard Hudson's disappointed cry. Baird's reply did not mention his blackbird at all. Hudson mentioned that Dr. Burmeister, curator of the Buenos Aires Natural History Museum, "would like to know what name you would give this blackbird." It is probably that Hudson hoped to put his own name on it.

Twenty-five years later, Hudson began to write his "Idle Days in Patagonia," recalling his South American bird-hunting dream: "I hope to find new specimens, such as a beautiful bird, such as a wryneck, a meadowlark, etc., but this bird must never have been seen by human eyes, nor has it been named. I don't know if other ornithologists have such great feelings; as for myself, I even dream of a new bird at night, actively seen by me; such a dream is beautiful to me, and I often feel sad when I wake up. This bird in the dream is often gray, brown or other stable colors."

In this paragraph, we hear the accelerated sound of the poet's feelings. Then, the disappointment in the letter can be imagined. Now we know that this blackbird is the Argentine cowbird, scientifically called Molothrus rufoaxillaris, which was discovered by an American scientist who discovered the bird only a few months earlier than Hudson, preventing Hudson from realizing his dream early. It was not until a few years later, in Patagonia, that he collected a surprising bird, which was named after him, called Cnipolegns hudsoni.

The Smithsonian Institution still retains many of the birds that Hudson collected around 1866, and people can tell at a glance which ones were collected by Hudson. Because everyone else's legs are facing backwards, he puts his legs forward.

Hudson mentioned in his fourth letter that he enclosed a photo, which has also never been published.

Leaving Conchhas was Hudson's highest wish, which can be known from the four letters he gave to the Smithsonian Institution. In June 1867, he said: "If I stay at home, I will not be able to collect completely." In March of the following year, he reported: "Maybe I will leave Conchhas." On June 3, 1868, he had already decided in his heart. In his last letter, he said, "Now I am troubled by miscellaneous affairs and cannot concentrate on collecting. But I still have the wish that soon I can use all my time to pursue the scholarship I love. Naturally, I am going to leave Conchhas, because there are no new specimens to be found here anymore."

Apart from Patagonia, we don't know where Hudson traveled. After 1868, the curtain fell again. But in the two-year period from December 1865 to June 1868, due to the discovery of museum letters, this curtain rose again, and we know the period when Hudson collected bird specimens; his hopes, plans, and previously questioned parts are all known.

The young woman Fang Zhen died of lung disease in Fuxing Park. Although the incident is not enough to be a lesson, her calm arrangement before her death was quite charming, so I pity her with a poem. (See today's newspaper for details)

Do not be sad about burying your delicate body; you have seen through the world and are even more heartbroken. The most touching thing is the lingering perfume, which still makes the ghost fragrant all over.

The inscription on the tombstone is simple and thought-provoking. The little birds and delicate flowers are silent. Where have the violent storms gone? How pitiful that such a beautiful figure has fallen!

### Foot Kiss

— Sikong Wuji

To ROZA

In every most inadvertent place.

I send out my distant thoughts;

On every strange smile,

I am trying to find the bud of my misty heart.

In the ant-like crowd of tourists,

I am particularly aware of loneliness,

When I am lonely, I only close my singing mouth.

The water of Taihu Lake is as misty and vast as

My elusive thoughts.

The willow branches on the shore are like your soft hair

Floating across my face;

And fluttering through my trembling soul.

How much poetry is hidden at the intersection of water and sky!

Turning my head, I am left behind the line of sight

I gently, gently explore the road ahead;

I am surprised that my thoughts shattered the leaves.

With how many dreamy footprints

I stealthily kiss your fragrant trail.

Sikong Wuji

### Maple Bridge

— Yang Daming

Familiar bridge

Familiar maple leaves

Everything remains the same

Old dreams are like rainbows

Lonely shadows

Lonely memories

Twelve years of war and displacement

The songs of the past have been buried

A falling pebble

Stirs up ripples

Are they the wrinkles of longing

Or the tear marks in my heart

A tear of longing

A pearl of the night

I am willing to sprinkle ten thousand pearls as a gift

To illuminate the smile of your childhood

### Owl

— Luo Yingfeng

Resting in the deep forest

Hesitating on the tall branches

The sun does not know your dwelling

Like an ancient recluse philosopher quietly thinking

Despising the brilliance of spring

Despising the chirping of the morning

When the autumn wind howls in the night

Use sad songs to make the village tremble

### Smoke

— Mai Jun

A piece of blue sea,

Rippling with the boat of thought;

This strange and mysterious voyage,

The small boat often rises in the blue!

Some say it is a source of inspiration,

Creating many beautiful poems;

Some say it is a symbol of life,

The magnificent waves suddenly wither.

But I believe in one sentence,

It is the true incarnation of Venus;

This light jade body and graceful dance.

Is comforting my lonely heart!

### Bed

— Wang Deyun

Life gives you fatigue, bed gives you rest; life gives you suffering, bed gives you comfort; life gives you the ugliness of reality, but bed gives you the beauty of dreams.

"Introspection in the Deep Night" happens at the dead of night when you are lying in bed; the joy of reading a book under a blanket on a snowy night also happens when you are in bed; "Listening to the wind and rain all night in a small building" even depicts the elegance of a poet on a couch; "Bright moonlight before my bed" evokes homesickness, making one feel deeply melancholic.

Bed: it is the window on a rainy day, the umbrella under the scorching sun, the nanny of life, the mother of the sick.

Far-reaching thoughts and truth are the places where the spirit rests; the bed is where the weary body rests; it gives you memories, introspection, wisdom, and even rebirth, joy, and comfort.

Therefore, a weary body certainly needs a bed; an unhealthy and distorted mind even more needs the nurturing and management of a mental bed.

Life cannot be separated from the bed. The relationship between the bed and life is too close. People spend almost half of their time entrusting themselves to the bed. Although dreams occur on the bed, the terrors of the human world are indeed even greater than dreams. Although ancient people once uttered the bold saying that a great man should be wrapped in horsehide and die on the battlefield rather than in bed, in fact, the "horsehide" and "battlefield" they referred to are also "beds," but more lofty and grand places of trust.

I believe that the truest emotions and truest faces of people are revealed when they are sound asleep in bed. Daytime is contrived and artificial (hence Lu Xun's "Ode to the Night at Night"), while night is exposed and genuine. A person's daily life is both tedious and treacherous. Only when you return home with a body and mind full of weariness and disappointment and lie on the bed can you no longer need to deploy your "worldly" skills, nor be meticulously cautious about anything anymore. You can freely relax your body and mind, and indulge wantonly and unreservedly. Although some people believe that people's sleeping postures are detestable, might the true face of Lushan still not be charming? The same goes for dreams. Who can believe that the grand and dignified conversations of the daytime are more real than the dream artistry of midnight?

Truly, those who have beds are blessed. Friend, when you leisurely light up a cigarette and lie quietly on a comfortable Simmons mattress, have you ever thought of the wanderers who brave the stars and moon and eat frost and dew?

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 347

— Ye Jingfeng

The guest choked with emotion, lifting his wide sleeve to wipe away his tears. The handsome, robust energy of his youth in school, the British gentlemanly demeanor of his middle age, not a trace of these could be found on him at this moment. From the time he was robbed at Changxindian until today, it has been only about ten days in total. Changxindian, Beiping, Tianjin, the situation has turned upside down, becoming a grim and ghostly world. He, Engineer Wu Dingyuan, has also completely turned into a ghost.

Indeed, he had borrowed a pistol from "04" and, after leaving the hospital room at Xiehe Hospital, wrote us a letter saying that he was going to seek revenge, to kill Japanese devils. The last news we received was that he had rushed out of Xizhimen. At the same time, another piece of news said that the Japanese army was also fighting our army outside Xishimen at that time. Based on our deduction at the time, we believed that he must have sacrificed himself.

"Brother Dingyuan," I suppressed my emotions, "How did you get here?"

"That's a divine story—a living deity enlightened me!" In his sorrowful tone, a trace of humor remained.

After he sneaked out of the hospital, he heard the sound of artillery fire deafening the sky outside the west city. He knew that the Japanese invaders were flaunting their power there. Without further consideration, he got into a rickshaw and told the driver to run west. Near Xibianmen, the rickshaw could not pass. The garrison troops were gathering there, preparing to rush out of the city and, together with the reinforcements, fight a bloody path to break through the encirclement. Staying in the city would mean being captured.

He was the only civilian running with the army. His sick body could not keep up with the troops. Although he ran for a few miles, his strength gave out, and he fainted by the roadside. When he woke up, he only felt a pair of hands massaging his head. Gradually, he discovered that the place he was sleeping was not like a hospital, nor like an ordinary residence. There was a divine seat, an eternal lamp, a bell, and a . Although the light was dim and he could not see the four walls clearly, he guessed in his mind that this was a small temple. What was especially confirming was that he discovered that the person massaging him was an old Taoist priest.

He exchanged a few words with the old Taoist and learned that he had been unconscious for three or four hours. The old Taoist noticed that he was ill and asked people to carry him to the temple—Sanqing Temple—a small, poor Taoist temple. There was only one old Taoist and one old incense keeper in the temple. The old Taoist said that he knew a little about pulse diagnosis and had taken his pulse. He knew that he was out of balance after the illness and that he would be fine after a few days of rest.

Two days later, the old Taoist told him that the city and the outside of the city could temporarily be at peace. Beiping had been controlled by the Japanese. As long as he did not "resist," there would be no danger. He did not keep any secrets from the old Taoist, telling him his experience and the tragic deaths of his six or seven family members, and saying, "This sick body of mine is useless alive. I must risk this life to kill a few devils to avenge my wife and children."

The old Taoist, however, had another set of philosophical ideas: "This is a calamity; 'what is destined cannot be avoided.'... But 'it is better to live shabbily than to die well!'... As for revenge, if you take revenge with a sick body, it is better to wait until your body recovers... Moreover, Sanqing Lao Ye (Li Lao Jun) does not advocate revenge, but he also does not allow demons and monsters to run rampant. Therefore, there is Erlang Shen under the throne of Lao Ye, who is specially in charge of subduing demons and eliminating monsters. It is better to ask for a divination to see the opinion of Sanqing Lao Ye and Erlang Shen. It is more certain..."

### Stopping "School Shops" from Extorting Money

— Shi Lang

A few days ago, the Municipal Bureau of Education published the list of primary schools with open finances in the newspaper. This is a declarative measure, worthy of emulation by all parties. However, this is only a passive act of recognition. In the active aspect, the education authorities should more strictly announce the list of schools with undisclosed finances, so that they may be more cautious. More importantly, the education authorities should send personnel to supervise and audit school funds in order to completely clarify the severely chaotic financial situation of Shanghai's schools.

Taking the example of primary school students in the Sixteenth District Central National School reporting the school authorities, they revealed the following points:

(1) The upper semester has not yet ended, yet the fees for the next semester must be paid; (2) If they are not paid, expulsion from school is threatened; (3) Various fees are collected from students in a manner close to extortion, soliciting various donations; (4) False items are set up, and various construction fees, book fees, etc., are forcibly extorted.

This kind of "school shop" atmosphere must be jointly investigated by the Bureau of Education, the Council, and local impartial people. Its steps should at least adopt the following points:

(1) Allow students of all ages to present evidence and facts to report and accuse;

(2) Allow parents to list the items and amounts of various unreasonable fees forcibly collected;

(3) Allow teachers and staff to list the school authorities' deductions of salaries and all the dark sides of school administration.

Merely a document from the Ministry of Education announcing the regulations for the payment of miscellaneous fees for primary and secondary schools in the next semester is not enough to wash away the various "irregularities" of public and private schools of all sizes, nor is it enough to wash away the general parents' fear of paying fees for their children's enrollment.

The education authorities should launch a school cleanup campaign without delay to bring all schools in Shanghai into a normal and reasonable state!

### How to Relieve Sorrow?

— Translated by Ming Sen, written by American E. Dickert

Almost everyone is depressed at times.

The most necessary thing to relieve or reduce this periodic nameless melancholy is self-discipline; the second is understanding—understanding the truth.

First, you must sincerely decide that you really want to overcome this depressing mood. Second, you must understand that this depression is common rather than abnormal—almost everyone has it. Scientists have already discovered that happy and depressive emotions have a certain periodicity. Emotional highs and lows can be charted and the next "depression period" can be accurately predicted. Pathological depression and decline are also caused by the deterioration of this natural cycle.

Although depression and unhappiness are natural and periodic occurrences, you can try to relieve or reduce them. To eliminate this depression, all people can be divided into two major categories, and you must be able to fall into one of them: either you must face your depression head-on, find out its cause and take action to deal with it—or you must escape it, and use other activities to drive it out of your mind.

For people who find it difficult to admit their mistakes, "escape" is probably a worthwhile method. As for other people, if they escape reality, they will feel guilty.

To determine which type of person you belong to, try to answer the following questions: "Do you truly secretly admit your shortcomings? Are you able to make sincere self-criticism?" If you can do these things, then your most satisfactory way should be to face the cause of your depression and use action to eliminate it. If your answer is no, then you are probably better off trying to escape those occasional feelings of depression or resentment.

"Understanding the truth" is a necessary procedure to deal with depression. For example, if you carefully explore the reasons for your inner guilt, you may find that it is because you promised to take your wife and children to play, but did not do it. In such cases, you should take them out for a fun trip tonight or on the most recent holiday. By acknowledging your mistakes and correcting them, you can eliminate that guilt.

However, sometimes, the causes of your depression may be external circumstances that you have no way to change immediately other than to find them out—in that case, you can use a "substitute correction method." For example, if you are a woman and you feel disappointed and unhappy because you have not been invited to join a gardening club, what can you do? You can find a way to replace it: cook a particularly delicious dish for your family to prove that you are not incompetent. A better remedy is to start cultivating the best exotic flowers and plants in the area. Or discuss your problems with close friends. Never ask for sympathy. Only wise consultation will help you see that you are not the only one who has had such feelings.

The "low tide" of depression is not difficult to recognize when it strikes. If you are someone who has to escape, you should try to avoid thinking about the problem that is bothering you, and instead turn your mind to some activity that you love and are good at. Put your energy into doing it—whether it is a game, reading the newspaper, hard work, or sleeping.

A housewife I know has realized that "hard work on housework can drive away any of my worries." When the emotional low tide strikes, she works hard to clean the house, tidy up the rooms, and wash everything.

Another woman I know has exactly the opposite treatment. She said: "When I am in a bad mood, I want to leave home and change my environment! Go to the movies, look at the shop windows. I immerse myself in external things and forget my troubles."

I also know a man who uses sleep to get through his "depression period," just like a drunk after drinking.

What method you use to escape your depression seems to be irrelevant—as long as it can make you concentrate.

I also want to introduce something: a "depression diary." The next time you feel bad, start keeping this diary, and write in it every time thereafter. First record the date when your depressive emotions began, then record how you feel, what you determine its cause and reason to be, and how you plan to cure it.

This kind of diary will become a record. If you take it out and review it during a period of depression, it will remind you that you have been in such a bad mood before and eventually overcome it. It will also show you which treatments are effective and which are not. And writing out your depression will also help you forget it.

Banquet donations changed to a tax starting at ten thousand yuan

Foreign money tycoons, golden spendthrifts, crowd the restaurants day and night, swallowing large pieces of meat and fish, adding two or three at a time!

### MacArthur in Japan

— Bao Zhongqi

From the Japanese perspective, Rick Worser has been recognized as a symbol of Japan's new democracy, a living God. They believe that all the rights they have today were bestowed by MacArthur alone. To express their gratitude, thousands of Japanese people write letters to MacArthur, thanking him for his food, protection, and democracy.

MacArthur rarely appears in Tokyo, not even often inspecting the troops. Therefore, not only is it not easy for the Japanese to see him, but neither are his subordinates. Outside the gate of the US military headquarters, there are often many American soldiers and Japanese people holding cameras trying to capture a shot of MacArthur, but military police and police make it difficult for them to get close.

MacArthur gets up at 7 am every day, eats at 8 am, and then spends most of his time reading books. At 11 am, he goes to the US military headquarters to work, where he regularly reviews important documents and those letters from Japanese people. Apart from his chief of staff visiting him every morning, and foreign resident delegations occasionally meeting him once, MacArthur is "lonely" in Tokyo. In the past two years, Hirohito has only met with him two or three times.

MacArthur's recent policies for governing Japan, such as opening up Japan's private foreign trade, allowing Japanese fishing boats to sail to Antarctica for whaling, entrusting Japan with responsibility for mining on Palau Island, and restoring Japan's industrial equipment, have made the Japanese even more respectful of him.

### Lonely Journalism

— Hei Zi

I often dream that we have such a newspaper that can truly be national, that can allow every Chinese person to see it when they get up. But this dream is ultimately just a dream. Newspapers with 100,000 to 200,000 copies have already become the largest newspapers in our country, how far away are they from sales of several hundred million to several million copies? Therefore, I still doubt that there is a sufficiently large newspaper in our country that can be said to be truly national. It is already very good to be able to have a newspaper seen in major cities across the north and south of the country. Therefore, I admire the British "News of the World," whose circulation of 7.5 million copies accounts for one-sixth of the total population of the British Isles. That is to say, on average, one in six British people buys a copy of "News of the World." This is a very large circulation, probably already approaching the saturation point of one newspaper per household.

Generally speaking, a newspaper can be distributed to one household on average, which can be used as the highest circulation ideal for current social magazines. To achieve this goal, of course, requires huge capital, numerous talents, and a sound and rapid distribution system. More importantly, it requires a serious attitude and fair commentary. In this regard, the success of "News of the World" is attributed to its editorial policy, as pointed out by the New York Times in the United States.

We all know that a correct editorial policy must be to praise the good and criticize the bad, but in a society that does not respect public opinion, it is often regarded as personal preferences. Therefore, destroying newspapers will also become a "fashionable trend." Originally, society's support for the newspaper industry was not strong enough, but it was given spiritual blows and material destruction, which naturally made our country's concentration more symbolic.

In the past, incidents of destroying newspapers have emerged one after another in various places. The "Fuxing Evening News" in Kunming was destroyed by morning school students, and the "New Life Daily" in Anqing was robbed and destroyed by thugs. Now, the "Da Bao" in Ningbo has been ordered to suspend publication for three days by the Zhejiang Military Administration District and the county government because of its comments on the conscription system. Not long ago, a newspaper was destroyed, and its host even came to Shanghai to appeal, which also illustrates how fragile the objective foundation for the long-term development of our country's newspaper industry is.

Scientific Essays

### The Emergence of Butterflies

— Jia Zuzhang

In the ancients, who claimed to "investigate things to attain knowledge" but actually "did not know without investigating," the metamorphic process of larvae becoming pupae and then pupae emerging as butterflies was felt to be confusing and unable to be grasped concretely. The earliest record is in Zhuangzi's "Supreme Happiness" chapter, which says: "The root of a bird's foot is a grub, and its leaf is a butterfly." The "Heavenly Omens" chapter also says: "Butterflies are Xu, transforming into insects, born from rotting leaves, their shape like a shed skin, their name is Qu Duo." This is a record of generative transformation and cannot be considered to have understood the metamorphosis of butterflies. Later, the "Records of Searching for the Supernatural" said: "When wheat becomes butterflies, wings are born, eyes are formed, the mind is present, this is from unknowing transformed into knowing, and the qi is changed." "Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang" says: "Scholar Gu Feixiong saw a broken green skirt in a tree dwelling when he was young, which then turned into a butterfly. Zhang Zhoufeng, an official in the Ministry of Works, said that if lilies are closed and their calyxes are covered with mud, they will transform into large butterflies overnight." These are all just assumptions.

The most detailed and accurate record of actually seeing emergence is probably the explanation of cabbage white butterflies and swallowtail butterflies in Erya Yi: "Now the green worms in vegetables crawl on green walls or plants in spring, securing themselves with silk. One night, looking at them, they have corners. In six or seven days, their backs split, and they shed their skins to emerge as butterflies. The large butterflies scatter their eggs on citrus, which become green worms. After a long time, they transform into large butterflies." The "Zezhou Records" also says: "In the autumn of Chongzhen Gengchen, the trees on Xicheng Mountain were covered with worm shells, like human figures, three inches long, green, with clothes and sleeves complete, and black velvet threads through the armpits, like puppet ropes. Monks in the mountains took them to hang in their rooms. In spring, the green shells split, and a butterfly flew out, which was very interesting." This describes the shape of the pupae in great detail, but unfortunately, it does not explain the shape of the butterfly, so it is impossible to trace back to what kind of species it is.

The "Records of the Northern Household" has a record of charming butterflies. Although it is not known what kind of butterfly is referred to, it has valuable practical observations of the metamorphic process: "Lingbiao has crane grass, a vine flower. It blooms in summer, its shape like a flying crane, its wings and spurs are all complete. It is said to be a charming grass. Picking and drying it is used instead of facial rouge. A pair of worms grow on the vine, eating the leaves. They are collected into powder boxes and fed with leaves. When they are old, they shed their skins and become butterflies, red and yellow in color. Women collect and wear them, like delicate bird skins, making people charming and happy, and they are called charming butterflies."

After listing the explanations of various butterfly transformations, the "Compendium of Materia Medica" added a conclusion: "These are all based on what they have seen. They do not know that all insects shed their skins when they are old and transform into butterflies and moths, just as silkworms must emerge. Rotten clothes and objects also produce insects and transform." This is a very reasonable explanation. But then it says: "The transformation of plants, flowers, and leaves is caused by qi and wind. Their color also depends on the color of the flowers and leaves eaten by the insects and the color of the things they transform into." That falls into the mist of generative transformation again.

When silk moths first emerge, their wings are wrinkled, and their bodies are weak. They must rest for a considerable amount of time before they can spread their wings and fly. Yang Wanli has a poem about observing the transformation of things, which describes the state of an emerging butterfly very vividly: "The newly born butterfly has not learned to fly, its curly hair and wet powder sleep on the flowering branch. Later, borrowing the power of the wind and light, it does not remember the time of being foolish and drunk."

### American Miscellany

Hotels have become a necessity in American life because many small families do not cook for themselves, but eat out. American young couples rarely have the patience to cook, either burning the noodles or stewing the chicken soup dry. Moreover, cooking for themselves, buying vegetables becomes a major event. In inland China, vegetable vendors bring vegetables to the door. In the United States, they must go to the grocery store to buy them. Americans do not have the habit of using baskets, so they clamp large loaves of bread under their arms and hold chickens, fish, milk, eggs, grapes, and cabbage in their hands. Of course, those with cars do not need to carry them themselves, but when the housewife goes shopping, the car has already been taken by her husband to the office. If it is a small family of two people, it is better not to cook for themselves. Restaurants are concentrated in the downtown area, and coffee shops are almost on every street. Coffee shops have food, but sandwiches can also fill the stomach.

Restaurants are divided into several types. There are noble hotels attached to large hotels, where there is a band accompanying the Qin during meals, and the minimum is three and a half yuan per person in guided places. Ordinary restaurants without bands are about two yuan per person. Larger coffee shops also provide food. The most economical and generous is the self-service cafeteria. The scale is extremely magnificent, enough to accommodate more than a hundred people for dining. After entering the door, line up in a row, taking plastic plates or lead plates, knives, forks, and glass cups. When walking to the food distribution counter, take any dishes you want, such as braised beef, noodles, chicken soup, cold dishes, ice cream, coffee, pastries, etc. When passing by the accounting lady, she writes the price of the food on a piece of paper and hands it to you. Then find a place to sit down, and pay the money to a lady who collects money after you finish eating. Generally, it costs about one yuan per meal. There is no tip here. If you go to other restaurants, not only are the dishes more expensive, but you also have to give a tip of 10% to 20%.

We Chinese people give tips of one or two yuan in order to win face for the country. If ten people are dining together, giving ten or twenty yuan in tips is already very generous. The YMCA canteen is a more economical place, but there is only one YMCA in each city, while self-service restaurants are everywhere. The cold drink counters in drugstores also provide sandwiches and long, round breads with sausages. Americans call that liver-colored artificial sausage "hot dog." American women like to eat that kind of thing the most, but if you ask her if she wants to eat sausage, she will blush and feel embarrassed. That thing is neither delicious nor elegant. (Twenty)

### Is This Tolerable, What Is Intolerable?

— Xiang Jun

"On June 25, 1947, the British government held a boxing match in Plymouth. They invited diplomatic envoys and military personnel stationed in Britain from various countries to attend. The grand occasion, with over 200,000 people, was rarely seen after the war. Our 600 naval personnel stationed in Britain also arrived on time and were placed at the forefront alongside military personnel from other countries. As the flags fluttered in the breeze, the flags of Britain, America, the Soviet Union, France... and other countries stood proudly side by side, but the Chinese flag was conspicuously absent. Just as we were about to question this, the British side suddenly requested that we move to the back. Only afterward did we learn that they had moved British female soldiers to the front row. At this moment, the audience's emotions were already high and clamorous, following the tension of the boxers. Suddenly, from the ranks, we heard Mr. X's sorrowful and indignant cry: 'Look, look—our national flag!...' Under the gaze of thousands, we saw a huge 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth' national flag being spread flat on the boxing ring—trampled under the feet of the boxers. The 600 Chinese naval personnel, witnessing this insult to their motherland, were all filled with grief and indignation, and tears streamed down their faces. They immediately questioned the organizers, whose reply was, 'I don't know.' So, they indignantly returned to their camp together—(i.e., the Renown cruiser). They telegraphed our ambassador to Britain, requesting a strong and effective protest, but there has been no response to date. All believe that this incident was not accidental. If a reasonable and satisfactory public response is not received, they are willing to return to China immediately as a whole, and will request the people of the nation to unanimously refuse to accept the 'gift' from the 'Great' British Empire of outdated and dilapidated warships. ... "Excerpt from a friend's letter.

Regarding the above news, our government should immediately issue a serious protest.
