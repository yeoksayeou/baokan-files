### Fierce Battle in Jiaodong, National Army Achieves a Great Victory, Situation in Northeast Becomes Increasingly Clear, Tensions on Beining Road, Zheng Dongguo Flies to Jinzhou

(Report from Qingdao, this newspaper, 11th) After eight days and nights of fierce fighting on the borders of Gaomi, Changyi, and Weixian, the National Army has achieved an unprecedented victory in the Jiaodong battlefield. Li Jianji, commander of the bandit's Second Column, was killed, and over 25,000 bandit troops were annihilated, with a large amount of military supplies captured. This battle, which began on October 3rd, saw the remnants of the bandits gather approximately 100,000 troops from various main forces in eastern Shandong and southern Shandong to concentrate their attack on the Fanjiaji position. The defending troops of Huang Guo's division, with only four regiments, held their ground against more than ten times their number of bandits, awaiting reinforcements. Thanks to our large air force providing assistance day and night, and reinforcements from various locations advancing non-stop, by the morning of the 9th, our troops had completed the encirclement on all sides. With the assistance of the air force, we launched a general offensive against the bandits. The defending troops at Fanjiaji also took the opportunity to counterattack bravely. By nightfall, the bandits had suffered heavy casualties and were on the verge of collapse. By the morning of the 10th, the remnants of the bandits were forced to flee in three directions. Their Ninth Column fled north, seemingly returning to the Dazeshan area, while the Second and Seventh Columns fled southwest towards Zhuyang and Jingzhi. The siege of Fanjiaji was lifted, and this battle concluded victoriously. The Jiaodong campaign is expected to be completed smoothly.

(Report from Jinan, this newspaper, 11th) The National Army, coming from Pingdu to reinforce Taitou, eliminated communist resistance along the way and joined forces with Wang Lingyun's National Army in Taitou on the 11th.

(Report from Changchun, this newspaper, 11th) The situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly clear. The battle between Tieling and Kaiyuan is the biggest key to the change in the war situation. Currently, reinforcements from within the pass are pouring into the Northeast, so the communist bandit's fate will be determined within a week. The communist bandits in Songbei seem to have new actions. They have been mobilizing on a large scale near the Songhua River, leveling all the trenches they had previously dug to prevent the National Army from advancing.

(Report from Shenyang, this newspaper, 11th) The weather is cold and rainy, and the war has not stopped. The bandits have no power to capture major strongholds on the front lines and are now harassing weaker areas, seemingly considering new strategies. On the northern front, the bandits are focusing on Tieling, gathering forces to besiege it, and also using scattered units to launch sneak attacks on the railway connecting Tieling and Shenyang. The Dalongfu Bridge, north of Wenguantun Station, eight kilometers north of Shenyang, was suddenly attacked by over a thousand bandits at 11 PM on the 10th. The traffic police resisted forcefully. After about an hour of fighting, the National Army rushed to reinforce and drove the bandits back. On the western front, the bandits intensified their attack on Xinlitun. The National Army's forces were weaker, and Xinlitun was captured by the bandits before noon on the 9th. Xinlitun is a key point connecting Jinzhou, Dahushan, Jincheng, Beining, and Tongliao. Fuxin coal production is also transported through here to Shenyang. The Hongluoxian highway station, about sixty kilometers southwest of Jinzhou, was captured by a part of the bandit's Twelfth Brigade on the 10th.

(Another Telegram) Zheng Dongguo, accompanied by Shu Shicun, commander of a certain army corps, flew to Jinzhou on the 11th to take command. The fighting on the Beining Road has become tense again.

(Central News Agency, Shenyang, 11th) After the elite army arrived in Yingkou, the morale of the people was greatly boosted, and the fighting around Yingkou subsided.

(Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th) The National Army in Jilin and Changchun has effectively controlled the entire area south of the Songhua River in the Jilin-Changchun area. The National Army in eastern Jilin still controls major strongholds such as Wulajie, Longtanshan, and Dafengman. There are no large bandit traces within fifty kilometers along the Jilin-Changchun line. The National Army in Changchun tightly controls the two major strongholds of Nong'an and Dehui within a hundred kilometers to the northwest.

### Fierce Fighting Begins on the Outskirts of Luoyang, Songbu and Huang'an Captured in Eastern Hubei

(Report from Kaifeng, this newspaper, 11th) Military news: A part of the bandits besieging Luoyang, about a brigade in strength, attacked the area around the West Gate bus station last night under the planned enticement of the National Army. The National Army dispatched a large number of tanks from the West Gate, using intense firepower to attack the bandits. At the same time, the reserve forces ambushed at Guandizhong also joined the annihilation battle with great speed. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered over three thousand casualties and collapsed. Another bandit force of unknown size is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army in the area east of Luoyang.

(Report from Zhengzhou, this newspaper, 11th) The true face of the communist bandits attacking Luoyang has been revealed. There are 20,000 bandits near the West Palace, engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. Gunfire is also very intense near the West Gate.

### Communist Bandits Captured in Beiping

Confessed to Being Important Members, Case to be Announced Soon

(Central News Agency, Beiping, 11th) This city recently cracked down on an important communist bandit organization, including Meng Xian Gong and Li Gongyi, students of Peking University, and Tian Cong, a teacher at Beiming Girls' High School, who participated in communist bandit activities. After being arrested and interrogated, all confessed to being important members of the communist bandits, responsible for stealing information from military and government agencies and carrying out sabotage. The evidence is solid, and they have written confessions detailing their involvement in the Communist Party and their tasks. At this critical moment of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, the Chang Bureau attaches great importance to this case and will severely punish them according to law. The details of the case will be announced soon.

Central Government Makes New Arrangements for Military Operations to Suppress Bandits in the Northwest

### British Prime Minister Sends Letter to President Zhang, Hoping to Promote Sino-British Friendship, Parliamentary Delegation Busy with Receptions in Nanjing

(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) The British Parliamentary Delegation arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 9th and immediately paid respects to Chairman Jiang and his wife, and dined with them. At 10 AM on the 10th, a special press conference was held at the British Ambassador's residence. Ambassador Stevenson introduced the delegation members to the reporters present one by one. The delegation leader, Lord Ammon, said in his speech: the delegation is extremely happy to meet with members of the press, so they held this meeting as soon as possible, hoping that the reporters can convey their joyful mood of coming to China during the Double Tenth Festival and the British people's earnest concern for China to the Chinese people. He then answered reporters' questions, saying: they are very concerned about the current situation in China. The general British public cannot understand why China has not yet achieved stability after winning the War of Resistance. China's war has greatly hindered Sino-British trade. British newspapers cannot publish as much news about China due to space limitations, but this does not mean that they are not concerned about China. They hope that this situation can be improved when the British economic situation improves. The general economic situation in the UK is very difficult, but now the whole country, regardless of party affiliation, is working together to increase the development of import and export trade. They believe that overcoming difficulties cannot rely on foreign aid; the UK must rely on its own efforts. As for the delay of the Sino-British trade agreement, he believes that it is a mistake in official correspondence. The vast majority of British people are willing to re-establish Sino-British business relations and strengthen Sino-British trade. If sufficient transportation and a safe environment can be obtained, there is still much that can be done. At 11:30 AM, accompanied by Ambassador Stevenson, the delegation went to the National Government to sign the congratulatory book. At noon, they visited Mayor Shen Yi at his official residence on Beiping Road and attended a banquet. In the afternoon at 3 PM, they went to the National Assembly Hall to attend the group wedding ceremony of 253 couples as honored guests. They were all very interested in this new social cause of frugality. They then visited the Xiaguan Capital Power Plant and the workers' welfare society. Dr. O'Malley, who is a doctor, was particularly interested. At 5 PM, they went to the International Friendship Association and attended a grand cocktail party invited by Vice Minister Liu Shishun. In the evening, they visited Vice Chairman Sun and stayed for a banquet at his residence. At 11 AM, they visited President Zhang Qun and Vice President Wang Yunwu, and then went to the Senate to visit Secretary-General Shao Lizi. They all still remembered the friendship of the Senate's visit to the UK during the war and deeply admired the contributions of the Senate. They visited Central University, Ginling Women's University, and Jinling University. At noon, they were treated to a lunch by Chen Yuguang (principal of Jinling University), chairman of the Nanjing City Council. In the afternoon, they visited the Central Hospital and the Children's Welfare Society. Dr. O'Malley, being a doctor, was particularly interested. At 5 PM, they attended a cocktail party hosted by Secretary-General Hang Liwu of the Central Culture Association, which was attended by 200 people. The music group of the Central Broadcasting Station performed wonderful entertainment programs such as Chinese music "Spring River Flower Moon Night," "Ambush from All Sides," and "New China Overture." Delegation leader Sir Ammon gave an impromptu speech, praising Chinese music greatly and expressing his admiration for the association's work in promoting Sino-British cultural exchange. In the evening at 8 PM, the entire delegation attended a banquet hosted by President Zhang Qun. The 12th was the delegation's third day in Nanjing. In the morning, they visited the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and had a lunch there. In the afternoon, they visited the Sun Yat-Sen Mausoleum and toured scenic spots such as Tanmu, Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, and Xuanwu Lake. In the evening, they were treated to a banquet by Ambassador Stevenson and his wife.

(Reuters, Nanjing, 11th) The British Parliamentary Delegation brought a letter from Prime Minister Attlee to President Zhang Qun, which expressed the hope that the delegation's visit would further promote friendly and sympathetic relations between China and Britain.

Vice Chairman Sun immediately expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Legislative Yuan and the Chinese people, and sent a separate letter of thanks in reply.

### US House Committee Delegation Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing, Visited Chairman Before Departure

(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) The US House Military Expenditure Audit Committee delegation, including Congressman Cole and six others, flew to Nanjing from Qingdao by special plane at 11:30 AM on the 10th. Ambassador Stuart, General Rooks, Rear Admiral Mourey, and our Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao went to the Daxiaochang Base to welcome them.

### Adjusting the Salary of Public School Staff, Executive Yuan is Synthetically Discussing, Difficult to Implement According to the Cost of Living Index

(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) After the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and professors from Peking University separately proposed specific opinions on the method of adjusting the salary of public school staff, the Executive Yuan is now comprehensively studying the three methods, since the deadline for the March 1st adjustment has arrived. Chen Kewen, Accountant General of the Executive Yuan, told reporters on the 11th: the method of adjusting according to the cost of living index is very appropriate, but there may be some difficulties in the implementation. Because the cost of living index not only differs from place to place, but also differs at the beginning and end of the month in one place, it is impossible to adjust every half month. If so, it should still be implemented by district, and the average of the index should be used as the standard. This method is not much different from the current method of adjusting by district on March 1st. The Executive Yuan is carefully studying a reasonable method that is easy to implement. Also, the adjustment method proposed by the Legislative Yuan was sent to the National Government on the 9th, and some people praised it. Some members of the Control Yuan believe that this method is very reasonable. The increase for low-level public school staff is less than double, and the increase for senior staff is even less. The Ministry of Social Affairs has also recently formulated a method, which is slightly the same as the method of the Legislative Yuan, but the base number is 40 yuan. It is also learned that the Executive Yuan will propose a method of adding a base number of 840,000 and 3,000 times, and it may be discussed at the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting next Tuesday, because the adjustment must be implemented starting in November.

### Actual Foreign Debt Payable by Our Country Totals Nearly 200 Million US Dollars, Accounts of US Lend-Lease Materials Being Cleared

(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan issued a reliable message on the 11th, stating that our "Wartime Government Foreign Credit Loans," "Wartime Financial Assistance Loans," and "Post-War Government Loans" total over US$734 million in government foreign debt. If the unused portion and the "Financial Loans" that have not yet been repaid are removed, the government's actual foreign debt payable is approximately US$194 million. The total amount of principal and interest to be repaid this year is over US$37 million (of which US$20 million is to be repaid with agricultural and mineral products). As for the US Lend-Lease materials, President Truman reported to Congress on December 27 last year that the portion lent to our country was over US$1.55 billion. However, the US military used a lot of it themselves. According to unofficial estimates by the Ministry of National Defense, the actual amount received by our country is only worth over US$900 million. This is currently being cleared by both China and the United States in Washington. It cannot be included in the current debt amount until an agreement is reached. An editorial in a Shanghai newspaper on the 22nd of last month, entitled "Our Foreign Debt," stated that "the total amount of wartime foreign debt is approximately US$3.2 billion. After the war, to purchase civilian Lend-Lease materials, an agreement was signed with the United States for long-term repayment over 30 years, totaling US$58.9 million. This huge debt amount, compared to the average national income of the five years before the war, accounts for approximately 45% of it." This is inconsistent with the facts, and the figures are even more different.

Rooks Will Go to Nanjing Tomorrow to Pay Respects to Chairman Jiang

In the meetings in various places, they encouraged each other to suppress the rebellion and build the country to commemorate this National Day with great significance. The citizens of Yantai, which had just been recovered, were particularly happy and excited. Sui Zonglin, chairman of the Yantai Chamber of Commerce, said in his report that the citizens of Yantai had been longing for the government's rescue for ten years and will work hard to revive the city under the government's leadership in the future. (For overseas celebrations, see page 2, column 1)

### Bullitt's Emergency Aid to China Proposal, Chinese and American Public Opinion Attaches Great Importance, We Welcome MacArthur as Military Advisor

(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: After the important essay by former US Ambassador to France and the Soviet Union, Bullitt, was published, various parties believed that Bullitt had a deep understanding of the current situation in China. The essay has attracted the attention of Chinese and American public opinion. It is believed that its results will be of great benefit to enhancing understanding and friendship between China and the United States. (For the full text of Bullitt's essay, see page 2)

(United Press, Nanjing, 10th) Political leaders here unanimously welcomed Bullitt's proposal for large-scale aid to China. Dong Xian Guang, director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, said: Bullitt's article is very timely and stimulating and will definitely help clarify some misunderstandings about China.

(Associated Press, Nanjing, 11th) Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang, said: "All Chinese people welcome Bullitt's powerful and insightful suggestions. If General MacArthur can serve as China's military advisor, not only China but the entire Far East will benefit from it."

(United Press, Tokyo, 10th) Regarding Bullitt's proposal, which was seconded by Congressman Cole, head of the Congressional Military Inspection Group, to appoint MacArthur to oversee the $1.35 billion aid to China plan, MacArthur himself remained silent, and MacArthur's headquarters had no response. Both of them had long talks with MacArthur, but the results were not announced.

(Associated Press, New York, 10th) Howard Newspaper commented on Bullitt's emergency aid to China proposal on the 10th, saying: "China is our oldest, closest, and most reliable friend in Asia. Therefore, today China has become the target of the Soviet Union, just as it was the target of Japan before. The responsibility and benefits of aiding China are very clear. The only thing is that we may be too late."

### Marshall Writes to Various Organizations to Promote Good Relations Between China and the United States

Marshall also wrote to various American organizations promoting Sino-American friendship on the 36th National Day of the Republic of China, saying: We can believe that the Chinese people will undoubtedly face the future with heroic determination to realize Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals. Marshall's letter reiterated the traditional friendship between China and the United States and was a powerful boost to the appeals of American civil organizations. According to a survey of editorials in American national newspapers, in the week ending on the 4th, comments on the situation in China still expressed concern about China's internal difficulties, and direct support for the Chinese government has increased compared to before.

### The Government Fully Supplies Materials to Save the Price Surge, Sincerely Hopes that the People Can Help to Overcome the Economic Difficulties Together

(Report from this newspaper) The economic and financial situation in Shanghai over the past two weeks has shown unprecedentedly drastic fluctuations, and all major cities in the country have been affected by it. The national economy and the people's livelihood are facing a serious threat. The reporter specially visited a leader in the economic and financial circles to inquire whether the central authorities will have new measures to deal with the current economic changes. I was informed: the recent price fluctuations are due to the widespread formation of the psychology of hoarding materials. Therefore, the current emergency plan is not just empty talk, but to make a careful supply of sufficient materials. Actual work is used to break the psychology of distrust of the monetary system, so as to save the price surge. The so-called actual work is to step up assistance in various aspects and increase the supply of materials. For example, in this period of scarcity of rice, in addition to the rice allocated to professional workers, we have also negotiated with the Ministry of Food to allocate a part of the rice to be sold to the general public. In terms of cloth, it has also been agreed that UNRRA will supply 200,000 dan of cotton to make up for the shortage of raw materials. All of this shows that the Chang Bureau is earnestly working to increase the supply of materials step by step, so there is no need to worry about the lack of normal needs. The leader then analyzed the causes of the recent economic changes and said: in the next few months, our country's economy may still have difficulties, but I hope that the general public can actively assist the government, then the difficulties can be overcome. The authorities will no longer add icing on the cake for enterprises that have already "made a fortune," and the current main economic strategy of the country is still on how to reduce the suffering of the general public from high prices.

### Analysis of the CCP's Strategic Evolution

— Yu Xin

From the victory of the Anti-Japanese War to the present, from the perspective of a military science researcher, I believe that the evolution of the CCP's military strategy can be divided into three major stages: and these three stages are actually strategies that are getting worse and worse. In Guan Nei (inside the passes, referring to inland China), the first two stages have come to an end. The third stage is just beginning.

From August 10, 1945, when the news of the enemy's surrender spread, for about three months, it was the first stage of the CCP's strategy. The general objectives of this stage were "seizing opportunities created by sudden changes," "striving for the fruits of victory," and "sharing the world equally." At this time, the CCP overestimated its own strength; the sudden surrender of the enemy gave it tremendous spiritual encouragement. Therefore, it wanted to complete the overall control of North China in the process of accepting the surrender, and further use the strength of the Central China Military Region and the East China Military Region to threaten Wuhan and Shanghai. Therefore, strategically, it adopted the method of comprehensive offensive and partial defense, in order to seize important strategic strongholds north of the Yellow River. The first target was Gui Sui, which straddled Shanxi and Mongolia; and the forces east of the Taihang Mountains were also strategically mobilized against the four major strongholds of Ping, Jin, Ji, and Bao at the same time. Therefore, the slogan that the CCP put forward to its cadres at this time was "Be brave, be brave, and be brave again!" "Advance, advance, advance again!" The meaning was that politically, it wanted a sharp turn; militarily, it wanted to accomplish everything in one go.

However, this strategy required "being able to attack" as its prerequisite. Therefore, as soon as Mao Zedong left Chongqing, the battle of Suiyuan-Baotou was launched on a large scale, and the encirclement of Ping, Jin, Ji, and Bao also began at the same time. However, unfortunately for the CCP, the first test of this strategy ended in a ruthless failure. The consistent facts proved that the CCP's military strength could not only not launch a frontal attack, but also caused the overall military deployment to be disjointed due to blind attacks, heavy casualties, and errors in deployment. Therefore, under the cover of the CCP's delaying policy of negotiating while fighting in political consultations, it prepared for its second stage of strategy.

From July 1946 to July of this year, it was the second stage of the CCP's strategy. The general objectives of this stage were: "defend the acquired positions" and "establish a protracted war." And it put forward the slogan of "preparing for a fifteen-year long-term war" to stabilize the internal situation and wait for major international changes. Therefore, strategically, it adopted the method of partial offensive and comprehensive defense, in order to defend the large area of land that it had seized during its victory. Then, taking this as a base, it would develop as opportunities arose. Therefore, the slogans it put forward to its cadres at this time were: "Oppose mountain-stronghold mentality" and "eliminate bandit ideology!" The meaning was that going up the mountain and becoming a bandit was a last resort. Military power must be able to flourish in several stable spaces. The loss or shake of space, in the final analysis, is also the loss and shake of combat power. This is the experience and lesson that the CCP summarized from the Jiangxi era.

However, this strategy also required "being able to defend" as its prerequisite. However, from the National Army's recapture of Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, the Yimeng Mountains, and even a series of facts in northern Jiangsu and the Jiaodong Peninsula, it proved that the CCP could not defend.

The CCP not only could not attack when advancing and could not defend when retreating militarily, but also, even in places where the National Army had not yet arrived, such as central Hebei, northwestern Shanxi, and southeastern Shanxi, social production stagnated, materials were exhausted, and the people's resentment was shaken due to the CCP's excessive military exploitation, forming a situation where there was no defense to retreat to politically. Therefore, the CCP had to start its third stage of strategy.

The CCP's third stage of strategy began in July of this year when Mao Zedong shouted the slogan "The only way is to fight out." This strategy replaces the strategy of offense and defense with "roaming." This is the old road taken by bandits in history! Its goal is to avoid decisive battles by roaming and preserve some strength: at the same time, it destroys society by roaming, and maintains its own survival from the chaos of destruction. The successive southward crossings of the Yellow River by Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Chen Yi and other units are evolutions of this strategy. However, this strategy contains four contradictions that cannot be resolved. First, in the roaming, it cannot complete the organizational control of society, and therefore cannot cultivate new combat power. Second, Napoleon said that "military victory lies in the feet," but his "failure also lies in the feet"; because the consumption of troops from excessive maneuver is often greater than the consumption of combat. Therefore, it is not easy to maintain the original combat power by roaming. Third, in terms of guerrilla warfare, it mainly depends on the organization of the masses. The fundamental reason why the CCP has gained local advantages in some battles in the past may also lie in this. But this condition is lost in the roaming. Fourth, the result of destruction by roaming will inevitably arouse great resentment from the people and strong self-defense forces. The bandit Li Zicheng was eventually annihilated by a small number of villagers, which is the inevitable result of roaming bandits. Therefore, this is definitely not the road that Mao Zedong originally wanted to take, but objective conditions cannot but force him to take this old road. This road is the road of mountain-stronghold mentality and bandit ideology that he himself opposed. As long as he believes that his strength is sufficient in a certain area, he will immediately abandon this last road. Therefore, the CCP's sixth offensive in Guanwai (outside the passes, referring to Manchuria) is again his hope to partially restore the strategy of the first stage under international support. Because Mao Zedong thought that if he was fully forced to take the third stage of strategy, that would be his greatest tragedy!

### Bullitt's Impressions of Visiting China

— Full Text

Preventing any one country from dominating China and mobilizing its 450 million people to oppose us is a matter of the utmost importance to the United States.

Only Japan and Russia threaten to dominate China. The United States has opposed either of these two countries when they became more dangerous aggressors. Japan is no longer a strong country. But the Soviet imperialists, who inherited the imperialism of Tsarist Russia and use the CCP as a tool of Soviet power politics, intend to turn China into an appendage of the Soviet Union. Not only China's territorial sovereignty but even its independence is in danger. For the sake of American self-defense, we must

Take Action

to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating China and mobilizing its manpower to oppose us.

Can China be kept out of Stalin's reach? Of course, it can. China's independence is of great interest to the United States. Compared with the price we pay to maintain its independence, the price we pay is really insignificant.

What method? Before answering this question, let us first review the history of the past 20 years and some current situations, which will help us answer the above question.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek succeeded in the Northern Expedition in 1928, and the power of the National Government spread throughout the country. From 1928 to 1937, although there was the Japanese seizure of the Northeast in 1931 and the communist disturbances, it was a period of great progress. By 1937, China's tax revenue had tripled compared to before, and the state treasury's revenue and expenditure were almost balanced. The New Life Movement launched by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek infused fresh blood and creative ideals into many Chinese people, especially young people. The communists were in Shaanxi, in a desperate situation, and seemed to have no power at all. Many people believed that although China had lost the Northeast, it would soon be able to restore its national strength and achieve economic soundness.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is wise. In the autumn of 1934, President Roosevelt sent the author to visit China. The report after the visit is still on file in President Roosevelt's private files. In several long conversations, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek made inferences about the future of China and the Far East. His vision and wisdom were unmatched by any previous politician. He

Asserted that Japan

would not allow China to restore its national strength and would attack China again because China's restoration was proceeding too smoothly and too quickly, and it could catch up with Japan. He said that Japan would launch a war of aggression against China at the latest in 1937. The war broke out in 1937. He said that the war would start with some minor incidents between Peiping and Tianjin. Later, it did happen near Beiping at the Marco Polo Bridge. He said that he would resist in North China and then give up. He would defend the Yangtze River basin and then give up. He would fight in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan and then give up. As a result, he would establish the capital in Chongqing, Sichuan. At that time, he had invested 100 million yuan to build small-scale arsenals in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places in Sichuan. He said that the Japanese would never be able to set foot in Sichuan. He said that he would never make peace with Japan as long as he was alive. As a result, Japan would definitely be defeated. This is the entire history of 1937 to 1945.

At that time, he also predicted that after Japan's defeat, if he was still alive, he would face the greatest difficulty in his life. The country was devastated, the people were exhausted, and leading China to peacefully build a democratic government and modernize China's ancient culture was his wish, but he felt that it was more difficult than defeating Japan.

He also foresaw this very clearly. A French proverb says it well: "Foresight is important in politics!" Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has foresight.

In November 1943, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in Cairo. After the meeting, the following joint declaration was issued:

"Cairo Declaration. December 1, 1943. President Roosevelt, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill."

"The purpose of the three countries is to deprive Japan of all the islands it has seized and occupied in the Pacific since the beginning of World War I in 1914, and to return to China the territories that Japan has stolen from China, such as the Northeast, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands."

However, fourteen months later, on February 11, 1945, President Roosevelt, Chairman Stalin, and Prime Minister Churchill betrayed China and signed the

Secret Agreement

This agreement sacrificed China's sovereignty over the northeastern provinces to Soviet imperialism. No treaty signed by an American president has been more unnecessary, more shameful, or more harmful than this agreement. Because there was absolutely no factor in the world at that time that could prevent Stalin from declaring war on Japan at the last moment, and we wanted to make him participate in the war, so our allies made great sacrifices, so this was unnecessary. Because no sophistry in the world can convince a sober-minded person that we have not violated our promise to China in Cairo, so it is shameful. Because we gave Stalin the most effective weapon to dominate China and opened the road to future wars in the Far East, it is infinitely harmful. (Continued on page 5)

### Basic Principles of the Partition of Palestine: US Expresses Support, Willing to Assist in Maintaining Security in the Region During the Transition Period. China Hopes the UN General Assembly Will Handle With Caution.

[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine is meeting today. The debate is expected to be so fierce that it will overshadow the intense verbal sparring between the US and the Soviet Union over the Balkans issue.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 11th] The United States today formally proposed support for the plan to partition Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, but with "some amendments and supplements." US Representative Johnson told the Special Committee on Palestine, "The United States is willing to participate in a viable political solution for the establishment of a UN in Palestine. The US delegation supports the basic principles of the partition and immigration plan unanimously recommended by various countries. However, to make the plan more effective, it is willing to propose some amendments and supplements. The US delegation firmly believes that there must be some geographical corrections, such as Jaffa, which is clearly an Arab city and should therefore be included in the Arab state. The US delegation recommends that the United Nations should ensure that all residents of Palestine, regardless of region or nationality, can enjoy access to ports, waterways, and electricity without discrimination, and that Arabs and Jews should have equal economic opportunities." Johnson continued, "The United States will assist in maintaining law and order in Palestine during the transition period, and US troops may also be available if obligatory police forces are needed later. However, it is hoped that the formation and abolition of such forces must be in accordance with caution." Johnson stated, "According to the final analysis, the ultimate solution to this issue depends on the Palestinian people themselves. If a new political structure is to last, the people themselves must be able to bear the responsibility of maintaining domestic order. For many years, Palestine has consistently experienced violence against the authorities and opponents, and now, due to the failure to resolve this complex issue, the trend of violence is even worse." Johnson concluded, "The reason why this issue has not been resolved to this day is that the countries concerned have failed to reach a basis for agreement. To seek a fundamental solution to the problem, the opinions of the world should be listened to most carefully."

[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu declared today that China is quite hesitant to support the division of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. Such a move is difficult to justify in terms of history, law, and justice, and may lead to armed conflict. The committee should find other ways to seek a solution acceptable to both parties in the dispute.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th] As the Palestine case heats up, Britain suddenly makes a surprising move, suggesting on the evening of the 10th that all 57 members of the United Nations should take "emergency measures" to fairly absorb a portion of the displaced people around the world. Britain made this suggestion to the United Nations Palestine Committee on the eve of the United States issuing a major policy statement on the Holy Land.

### Palestine in a State of Alarm: Arab Armies Deploy on the Border; Jewish Underground Army Prepares to Take Self-Defense Measures

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 11th] Although news of Arab armies gathering on the border has spread, the overall situation in the Holy Land remains stable.

[United Press, Beirut, 10th] The armies of five Arab countries began to take action today, implementing the Arab League's resolution last night calling on all Arab peoples to defend Palestine with manpower and financial resources and to oppose the Zionist movement. Spokesmen for the Lebanese and Syrian armies said that the armies of the two countries bordering Palestine began moving at midnight yesterday, transferring to the vicinity of the border to guard against terrorist acts and Jewish conspiracies.

The Transjordanian army, known as the largest and best-equipped in the Middle East, has also begun to concentrate along the banks of the Jordan River at six floating camps. In addition, Egyptian troops are preparing to enter the Sinai Desert, and Saudi Arabian cavalry have, at the request of the Egyptian government, crossed the border into Egypt to participate in the iron ring blockade of Palestine.

[Reuters, London, 10th] The Palestinian Jewish Council has issued a statement declaring that if the Arabs attempt to seize Palestine by force, the Jews will engage in self-defense.

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 11th] Authoritative sources in Damascus and Beirut said on the 11th that the so-called gathering of large armies in various Arab regions bordering the Holy Land was a "wonderful fantasy." They pointed out that the Arabs do not intend to launch a decisive military action before the United Nations makes a decision on Palestine. Grand Mufti al-Husseini and Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy Pasha went to Damascus to meet with Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli.

### Arab League Conference Moves to Amman

[Reuters, Beirut, 10th] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha said that King Abdullah of Transjordan fully agreed with the Arab League Council's decision that when Britain withdraws from Palestine, neighboring Arab countries should provide the Arabs of the Holy Land with military, moral, and economic assistance. The Arab League's "war preparation" secret talks will move from Lebanon to the Transjordanian capital of Amman on the 12th, where the chief representatives of the seven members of the League, namely Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, will secretly discuss with the King of Transjordan detailed measures to assist the Arabs of the Holy Land.

### Lebanon Receives Husseini, Britain Protests

[Reuters, London, 9th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government has protested to the Lebanese Foreign Office through its Middle East representative Evans regarding the fact that the Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, flew from Egypt to Beirut, Lebanon, and informed them that the Lebanese government's decision to receive Husseini had created an unfortunate impression in Britain.

[Reuters, London, 10th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain would probably not protest to Egypt about Husseini's flight to Beirut to attend the meeting, as Egypt had guaranteed last year that Husseini would not engage in political activities in Egypt, which did not include prohibiting him from leaving Egypt.

### Britain Pays Close Attention to the Situation in the Holy Land: If Armed Conflict Occurs Between the Arab and Jewish Peoples, It Will Consider Revising Treaties with Egypt and Two Other Countries

[Reuters, London, 10th] A Foreign Office spokesman said, "Rumors that Egyptian, Syrian, and Lebanese troops are advancing towards the Palestinian border do not affect Britain's decision to withdraw from Palestine if a solution without Arab-Jewish agreement is not reached. We sincerely hope that the Jews and Arabs can reach an agreement to avoid bloodshed."

[Associated Press, London, 11th] A British Foreign Office spokesman recently stated that if the trend of armed conflict develops near the Holy Land, Britain will consider revising its treaties with Egypt, Iraq, and Transjordan, which include clauses regarding the supply of British weapons to these three countries. However, the spokesman declared that Britain does not believe in the possibility of armed conflict, and if Britain believes that there is a threat of war between the Arabs and Jews, it will submit the matter to the Security Council.

### US Mediterranean Fleet to Visit Greece

[Reuters, Athens, 9th] The US Embassy announced that the US aircraft carrier "Leyte" will lead the 6,000-ton cruiser "Juneau" and the 2,000-ton destroyer "Massey" to visit Athens within two weeks.

### Kurdish Riots on the Turkish Border

Communists Support Behind the Scenes

[Reuters, Istanbul, 9th] Ali reported that a major riot by the Kurdish tribes in the Cizre district near the Turkish-Syrian border, where the Turkish and Iraqi railways connect, was launched by a Kurdish chieftain, intending to declare an independent Kurdish state. Communists support this independence movement. After the failed uprising of the Kurds in Iraqi territory in 1945, their leader Barzani led his troops to flee into Iran. Tonight, they were severely suppressed by Iranian troops. At the same time, some chieftains who supported the Kurdish independence movement have surrendered to the Iraqi government.

### Balkan Monitoring Committee: 11 Countries Including China and the Soviet Union Elected, Headquarters Located in Thessaloniki

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th] Disregarding the prior opposition of the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries, the United Nations Political Committee voted 32 to 1 to elect 11 countries, including China, the Soviet Union, Poland, the United States, Britain, France, Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, Australia, and Pakistan, to the Balkan Special "Monitoring" Committee. Twelve countries abstained, and twelve other countries did not participate in the vote. It was also resolved that the headquarters would be located in Thessaloniki, and work would begin 30 days after the UN General Assembly approved the case.

### Princess Juliana of the Netherlands to Be Sworn in as Regent on Tuesday

[United Press, The Hague, 10th] Crown Princess Juliana [of the Netherlands] is scheduled to be sworn into the regency on the 14th of this month in Parliament. At the same time, Parliament unanimously passed a law today allowing Queen Wilhelmina to temporarily relinquish her duties due to health reasons.

### Truman Clarifies Position: The United States Has No Intention of Dominating Any Country, Currently Rushing to Raise US Dollars to Intensify Aid to Europe

[United Press, Washington, 9th] President Truman, when hosting the press today, responded to the Soviet Union's most recent accusations of "US imperialism," saying that the United States has no intention of economically dominating any country or any continent. The government is currently rushing to raise US dollars for emergency aid to Europe.

No Way to Allocate Assistance to France for the Time Being

As far as France is concerned, there is no way to allocate funds to provide assistance for the time being. When the President spoke of the establishment of the new Communist International, he said that Under Secretary of State Lovett had fully expressed his views on this matter, and that he believed that what the United States had always hoped for was lasting peace and prosperity throughout the world for the benefit of all countries.

### US Food Conservation Movement Faces Possible Total Failure

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] US officials expressed serious concern that President Truman's voluntary food conservation movement may face total failure. To date, restaurants across the country have failed to comply with the President's call to set aside meat-free, egg-free, and poultry-free days each week.

### French Foreign Minister Returns Home, Claims US Has Guaranteed Assistance

French Prime Minister's New Measures Meet with Poor Response

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] French Foreign Minister Bidault, after returning from the United States, told the French people who were protesting Prime Minister Ramadier's "saving the franc" austerity plan that the United States had morally guaranteed to provide France with transitional assistance. He said at the airport, "I am very pleased with what Washington has done or is preparing to do." Bidault is expected to announce the details of the US aid plan for France over the weekend. French newspapers unanimously condemned Ramadier's remarks yesterday that "national spending must be reduced by 23 percent, and we must implement quotas and levy heavy taxes on scarce goods."

[Associated Press, Paris, 11th] The drivers' union suddenly went on strike on the 11th, allowing only a few lines to run one car per hour, leaving millions of people unable to move. A large number of police officers have rushed to the station to maintain order.

### French-Vietnamese War Intensifies

[Reuters, Hanoi, 10th] Semi-official French sources said that the large-scale military operation recently launched by the French army in the Tokyo region against the Viet Minh forces has made smooth progress on all fronts. In addition to announcing the occupation of Son Tay in the northwest, the French army communique also announced the occupation of Thong An and another important city, Hue Binh. The French forces in Hanoi and Hue Binh have joined forces. The French army's actions are mainly carried out by paratroopers. According to unconfirmed reports, Viet Minh Finance Minister Ly Van Huu has been captured by the French army.

[Reuters, West German, 10th] Agence France-Presse said that former Annam King Bao Dai will soon meet with senior French officials in Vietnam to discuss the Vietnamese political situation. The meeting will take place on a neutral ship.

### Yugoslavia Announces Decision to Sever Diplomatic Relations with Chile: Soviet Ambassador to Chile Attacked But Unharmed

[United Press, Yugoslav Capital, 11th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a formal statement today announcing Yugoslavia's decision to sever diplomatic relations with Chile. It is said that the Chilean government accused the secretary of the Yugoslav embassy in the capital of Argentina, Gaska, and the chargé d'affaires in the capital of Chile, Konga, of being diplomats from a "Moscow satellite state," colluding with the Chilean Communist Party to disrupt Chile, and expelled them from the country. This constitutes "an extremely arrogant defamatory act" against the Yugoslav government and "violates the basic principles of international relations," and is clearly part of "a planned act."

[United Press, Chilean Capital, 11th] President Videla today reiterated his unwavering belief in eliminating the Communist Party's control over the working class and ordered the strict implementation of coal rationing and the storage of fuel for military use. It is said that the current coal mine strike was instigated by the Communist Party at the instigation of foreign countries, with the aim of undermining Chile's security in the Western Hemisphere.

[Associated Press, Chilean Capital, 10th] Soviet Ambassador to Chile, Tsukov, was shot at here on the 10th. The assailant drove a very fast car and fired eleven shots at the ambassador, who was fortunately unharmed. The Chilean government immediately apologized to the Soviet Embassy.

### Deadlock in Tariff Negotiations Expected to Be Broken: Britain Reportedly Making Concessions to the US, British-US Trade Agreement to Be Signed Soon

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] British officials here said that a British-US trade agreement could be reached soon. British Ambassador Lord Inverchapel visited Secretary of State Marshall in New York. Responsible parties believe that the British ambassador intends to inform Marshall of Britain's new recommendations on reducing US tariffs and British imperial trade preferential tariffs in order to reach an agreement with the US.

State Department officials also revealed that when US Under Secretary of State Clayton visited London, he told Cripps that after Britain refused to make concessions, the US Congress and government would be negatively affected by the aid to Europe plan. It is generally believed that the breaking of the deadlock in British-US tariff negotiations is mostly due to Clayton's warning.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Authoritative sources said that the United States has put forward new recommendations that are expected to break the deadlock in tariff negotiations. It is reported that the new US recommendations are particularly favorable to British shipping merchants. The United States can therefore expect the UK and Commonwealth countries to reduce, or in some cases completely abolish, trade preferential limits, so as to be closer to the original US recommendations.

### Soviet Representative Fiercely Criticizes US Foreign Economic Policy

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th] Soviet Representative Arutiunian delivered a lengthy speech in the United Nations Economic and Financial Committee on the 10th, condemning the United States' foreign economic policy. The Soviet Union accused the US "ruling class" of promoting "the Marshall Plan in Europe and the MacArthur Plan in Japan," which are actually two parts of completing the world's sole plan. The United States attempts to rebuild Germany's war potential, rebuild Greece as a base for US expansion in Europe and the Middle East, and "restore Japan's imperialism." Arutiunian severely criticized the British-US decision to raise the industrial standards of western Germany, saying that this move directly violates the Potsdam Agreement and aims to rebuild the Ruhr region as a base for the US expansion plan in Europe. Arutiunian also blamed the United States for Britain's economic situation. The United States often attaches "intolerable conditions" to its aid to other countries. The United States is using Britain's current financial difficulties to force Britain to adopt policies that are harmful to its interests in the name of aid.

### Imposing Business Tax on Food Will Increase the Burden Only on Citizens. Two Groups, the Commerce Association and Others, Will Hold a Meeting Today to Launch a Nationwide Appeal by Grain Merchants for Exemption from Taxation

[Our Newspaper] Grain merchants previously requested exemption from business tax on food, and the central government approved a one-year exemption, which expires at the end of September this year. Taxation will begin from October 1st, with a tax rate of 15 per mille. Grain merchants from the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, jointly appealed to the central government in July for exemption from taxation. The Ministry of Finance rejected the appeal. The preparatory offices of the Republic of China General Chamber of Commerce and the Republic of China Grain Business Association Federation are scheduled to hold a meeting at 2:00 PM today at 377 Minguo Road to discuss launching representatives from chambers of commerce and grain merchants in various provinces and cities across the country to appeal to the central government again for exemption. The preparatory offices of the National Chamber of Commerce and the Grain Merchants Business Association Federation hosted the press last night to report on the process of requesting exemption from the business tax on food. According to Zhen Hua, executive director of the Shanghai Rice and Grain Association, food has never been taxed, as is the case in various countries. Overseas grain shipments to China are exempt from import taxes, etc. Especially at a time when rice prices are fluctuating and food is severely in short supply, taxation will have a serious impact. At present, Shanghai's daily consumption of rice is 15,000 shi. If the market price is 800,000 per shi, the tax per shi is 12,000 yuan, totaling 180 million yuan per day. The daily consumption of miscellaneous grains is 6,000 dan. If the market price is 400,000 per dan, the tax per dan is 6 yuan, totaling 36 million yuan per day. The daily consumption of flour is 12,000 bags. Cargo tax has already been paid when it leaves the factory. If food business tax is also required, with a market price of 240,000 per bag, the tax per bag is 3,600 yuan, totaling 43.2 million yuan per day. The total tax revenue is 259.2 million yuan, which is the food business tax that Shanghai should pay every day. This does not affect the interests of the grain merchants themselves, but increases the burden on ordinary citizens. Moreover, rice and grain go through rice milling merchants, wholesalers, transporters, distributors, sales area wholesalers, and retailers from the place of origin, totaling six times of business tax to be paid, which will eventually be added to the citizens who buy food. The heaviness of the burden is self-evident. At present, the central government believes that there are two reasons why exemptions cannot be granted: If food business tax can be exempted, other daily necessities merchants will follow suit and request exemptions as precedents. Food business tax is a local tax, and exemption will affect local finances. However, in the first point, the nature of each industry is different, and there will be no precedent. The government does not need to worry about this. In the second point, the local government's financial budget has not included food business tax, so exemption will not affect it.

### Two Reasons for Gasoline Price Increase: Recent Increase in Foreign Exchange Rate and Collection of Tariffs, Explanation from Person in Charge of the Transportation and Management Committee

Regarding the increase in gasoline prices, according to the person in charge of the Gasoline and Diesel Allocation Committee of the Transportation and Management Committee! All fuel is imported from abroad, and when the foreign exchange rate changes, it will inevitably change accordingly. Otherwise, the cost of the oil company will not be enough, which will inevitably lead to a reduction in supply. After the exchange settlement method was changed on August 18, gasoline needed foreign exchange, and the exchange settlement was based on the market price. Its cost was about three times higher than the original official price. The Committee repeatedly negotiated with the oil companies and advised them not to increase prices too drastically. In order to maintain stable oil prices, the oil companies agreed not to increase prices in proportion.

Recently, the increase in the exchange rate has indeed increased the cost of importing fuel. In addition, starting from the first day of this month, the Ministry of Finance announced that a tariff of 50% would be collected on gasoline imports. Due to these two reasons, the oil companies have repeatedly applied for price increases. The Committee will investigate its actual costs and verify the regulations. As for tariffs, it is a national tax revenue. There was this tariff before the war, and the current tax rate is the same as before the war. Before the war, the selling price of gasoline was nine cents to one yuan per gallon. The current selling price is 25,500 yuan. Compared to other commodity prices, it is relatively low. However, gasoline imports consume national foreign exchange. Recently, the United Kingdom has reduced the number of automobiles and restricted personal oil use, which is a last resort to save national foreign exchange. At this difficult time in our country, we sincerely hope that the people of the country will follow the example of the United Kingdom and save as much gasoline as possible to reduce the expenditure of national foreign exchange. The adjustment of gasoline prices is within the scope of the authority of the Import and Export Management Committee and has nothing to do with the Central Bank.

### New Canadian Ambassador to Shanghai Holds First Reception for Reporters Yesterday, Discussing Friendly Relations between the Two Countries

[Our Newspaper News] The new Canadian Ambassador to China, Dai Weishi, arrived in China in May. He recently arrived in Shanghai for the first time from Beijing. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, he formally hosted reporters at the Cathay Hotel for the first time and made a statement, saying: "I feel deeply honored and also feel a great responsibility to assume the position of Canadian Ambassador to China at this time. Because I believe that these years are one of the most important pages in Chinese history. China and Canada have many things in common, and have always been friendly over the years. This war shortened the war and saved the lives of many people in allied countries because of China's heroic resistance. I believe that all allied countries must be grateful to China. But we express our regret for the domestic disputes that China encountered after completing the war of resistance. I hope that China can end the war as soon as possible and move towards the road of restoration and national construction.

Trade between China and Canada began more than fifty years ago. Canada supplies more than 50% of China's newsprint. Although Canada's own production has decreased, it will still reduce supplies to other markets and supply more to China. At the same time, railway sleepers, flour, timber, mining tools, etc. are all important commodities for trade between China and Canada. And under Canada's price control, its prices have risen very slightly compared with the end of the war. On the Chinese side, Canada needs Chinese wool to make carpets, [missing character] tin to make steel, pig [missing character] to make brushes, as well as walnuts, peanuts, handicrafts, etc. Therefore, I firmly believe that mutual trade between the two countries will increase in the future.

Regarding the peace treaty with Japan, our country is also paying close attention. We are very eager to know that Japan will never use its aggression policy again.

He also reported that although Canada's contribution to Asia during the war was not as great as that to Europe, the Canadian Navy assisted the US military in fighting in the Far East, and the sacrifices were also quite significant. During the war, Canada donated US$2.5 billion in supplies to the Allied countries, of which 40 million yuan was supplied to China, all drawn from Canadian people's taxes. In addition, the Canadian China Wartime Relief Fund Committee donates millions of US dollars in cash and materials to China every year. Now that the war has ended, this committee has been renamed the "Canadian Aid to China Committee" to continue its work in assisting China.

In addition, in the United Nations, Canada's contribution to China ranks third in the majority. After the war ended, Canada loaned US$60 million to help China's reconstruction. Canada has a population of only 12 million people, so every person is proud of their donations to help China. There are currently about 40,000 overseas Chinese in Canada. They are diligent in their work, very frugal, and very friendly to the Canadian people.

Dai is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to Beijing. During his stay in Shanghai, he also plans to visit the United Nations and discuss the [missing character] after the end of the United Nations with UNRRA Director General Rooks.

Later, because of his bad character, Shen stopped using him, and he harbored resentment in his heart and planned revenge. At 6:00 PM on the 15th day of the seventh month of the old lunar calendar this year, He borrowed 20 million yuan from Shen Rong on the grounds of getting married. Shen refused, and there was a fierce quarrel. As a result, he only borrowed 1 million yuan, and Shen issued a bad check. He was even more resentful. It happened that another apprentice, Shen Huada, was also laid off and unemployed. They conspired to kill Shen to vent their anger, and He invited his cousin-in-law Pan Hesheng to help. At about 2:00 AM on September 16 this year, He and others sneaked into Shen's bedroom and hacked Shen to death with an axe. Shen's wife was also seriously injured. Later, the police station arrested the three murderers one after another. They confessed to the crime.

The elementary school is completely free and enrolls over 600 students, all of whom are children of employees of the five factories.

### Observations of Mr. Bullitt's Visit to China (Continued from Page Two)

The contents of the Yalta Agreement are as follows:

"Agreement Regarding Japan:" The United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain agree that within two or three months after Germany's surrender and the end of the war in Europe, the Soviet Union will join the Allied side in the war against Japan, under the following conditions:

" Outer Mongolia shall maintain its current status as the Mongolian People's Republic.

" The rights of the Soviet Union violated by Japan in 1904 shall be restored: a) The southern part of Sakhalin Island and its adjacent islands shall be returned to the Soviet Union. b) Dalian shall be opened as an international commercial port, guaranteeing the Soviet Union's preferential interests in the area, and the lease of Lushun shall be restored as a Soviet naval base. c) The China Eastern Railway and the South Manchuria Railway, which are vital transportation routes to Dalian, shall be established as a joint Sino-Soviet company, jointly managed by the two countries, and it is understood that the Soviet Union's preferential interests must be guaranteed, while China retains its full sovereignty in Northeast China.

" The Kuril Islands shall be handed over to the Soviet Union.

"The agreements concerning Outer Mongolia, Dalian, and railways shall be subject to the approval of Chairman Chiang. The US President shall accept Chairman Stalin's opinion on this and seek to obtain his consent.

" The leading powers agree that the Soviet Union's demands must be fulfilled unconditionally after Japan is defeated. The Soviet Union hopes to sign the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Chinese Nationalist Government to provide military assistance to China to liberate it from Japanese occupation. Signed in Yalta, Soviet Union, on February 11, 1945, by Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill."

The first clause in the agreement means that the

Communist country

established by the Soviet Union in the Outer Mongolia region of China will forever be separated from China.

The second clause recognizes the "rights" that Russia obtained in Northeast China after the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 through brutal force. The so-called "rights" that the US government has always denied its validity and rejected by our "Open Door Policy" have thereby become legal, which tramples on the policies of John Hay and Theodore Roosevelt.

The second clause's b and c sections not only give the Soviet Union "preferential rights" in Dalian, an important port in Northeast China, and complete control over the Lushun naval base, but also give it preferential rights over the railways connecting the Soviet Union to Dalian, dividing the northwestern and southern parts of the Northeast provinces in half.

This is as if the United States' allies secretly reached an agreement with the Soviet Union, allowing the Soviet Union to obtain "preferential rights" in New York City, completely control the naval port defending the city, and also give it the "preferential rights" over the central railway connecting the Great Lakes region to New York City. Under such circumstances, even if someone seriously tells us that we still have full sovereignty in New York State, we must wonder how to fulfill this promise, which is really a bit incredible. Before the Red Army

looted Northeast China

of industrial equipment worth about two billion US dollars and loaded it away, Northeast China's industry accounted for 70% of the entire China. Its importance to China is no less than that of New York State to the United States. The Chinese feel that our way of fulfilling the Cairo promise is really too strange.

The two paragraphs after the second clause contain even more vicious contradictions. In the previous paragraph, President Roosevelt agreed to seek Chairman Chiang's approval for the Soviet Union's desire to encroach on the heart of Northeast China, while in the second paragraph, the three powers agreed that the Soviet Union's demands "must be fulfilled unconditionally." In other words, regardless of China's consent or not, it must be implemented. This kind of clause directly harms China, a loyal ally who began to resist Japan in 1937, and its ridiculousness and baseness are unprecedented in American diplomatic history.

All Americans know that after we joined World War II, President Roosevelt's foreign policy and his hope for the realization of world peace were based on a fantasy that he could transform Stalin's Soviet imperialism into democratic cooperation. Although President Roosevelt had said on February 10, 1940: "Anyone who has the courage to face the implementation knows that the Soviet Union is under

dictatorial rule

, its absolute nature is no different from any dictatorial country in the world," yet in formal international exchanges, he regarded the Soviet Union as a "peace-loving democratic country," as if calling a tiger a lamb would turn the tiger into a lamb. The tiger did not turn into a lamb; it swallowed half of Europe and extended its claws to China and Korea. Before President Truman delivered his speech on February 12, 1947, the US government had always adopted a ridiculous attitude, regarding the Soviet Union as a peace-loving democratic country, and the Chinese Communist Party as merely land reformers who did not obey Moscow. This point of view has created a series of bizarre actions for us in the Far East. (To be published tomorrow)

### A Shangri-La Discovered in the Old Guangshan Mountains of Peng County

### Eight Institutes, Eighteen Years of Work: Report from the Academia Sinica Memorial Meeting

— Li Shuhua

Today, our institute is holding its 18th anniversary celebration. We did not want to hold a large celebration, and we did not dare to trouble all parties, so we did not notify all parties in advance. Originally, the 18th anniversary of our institute was September 9th of this year. At that time, it was too late, so it was decided to postpone it for one month. Today is October 9th, the day before National Day. Therefore, holding the 18th anniversary celebration today also has the significance of celebrating National Day in advance.

Our institute began preparations in November of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928) and was officially established on September 9th of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929). As of September 9th of this year, it has been a full 18 years. Our institute currently has a general office and eight research institutes: Physics, Chemistry, Pharmacology, Physiology, Zoology, Botany, and History. Our institute and the National Northwest United College jointly established the China Northwest Botanical Survey Institute. Before the War of Resistance, our institute had a Geology Research Institute, which was a collaboration with the Geological Survey Institute of the Ministry of Industry and was entirely led by Mr. Weng Wenhao. When the War of Resistance broke out, our institute faced financial difficulties, and Mr. Weng advocated: "Funding is temporarily suspended, but the relationship remains." The funding for the Geology Research Institute was temporarily suspended, but the relationship of investigation and research remained the same.

From Stability to Turbulence

From the 18th year of the Republic of China, our institute was established.

From the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929) when our institute was established to the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) was a period of stability. During this period, the research institutes of our institute completely focused on pure research work. Although they often conducted field surveys, collections, or excavations, they were always looking for materials for research in the laboratory. During this period, our colleagues at the institute made significant contributions in the academic field.

From the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) to the present, the past ten years of work have involved relocation, work during the War of Resistance, restoration, and the restoration of original work after the war. Before the July 7th Incident, our institute first moved the Physics and Pharmacology Research Institutes to Shanghai, and the Botany Research Institute to Wugong, Shaanxi. The relocated departments continued to work as usual. After the fall of Beiping and Tianjin, the work of our institute in Beiping came to a standstill. The general office of our institute and the Physics, Chemistry, Physiology, Zoology, and History Research Institutes moved to Kunming. Important books, instruments, and medicines were salvaged from Beiping after its fall, passing through Tianjin, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Haiphong to reach Kunming. We were able to work in Kunming for more than eight years, entirely relying on these salvaged books, instruments, and medicines. This salvage was truly a miracle! Later, the Radium and Pharmacology Research Institutes in Shanghai also moved to Kunming. A portion of the Botany Research Institute also moved to Kunming. During the War of Resistance, our institute, in addition to laboratory work, especially focused on applied research, while also paying attention to investigations and research with academic or economic value.

From Victory to Restoration

After Japan surrendered, our institute sent Mr. Qian Linzhao and Mr. Su Bingqi to Beiping to take over. The departments of our institute gradually returned to their original locations in the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946). The original buildings of our institute in Beiping had been occupied by the enemy and puppets, and were heavily damaged during the takeover, but have been gradually repaired. The books, instruments, and furniture left by our institute in Beiping were heavily damaged and lost. Fortunately, the first batch of 247 boxes of books and instruments arrived in Beiping from Kunming via Changsha, Hankou, Shanghai, and Tianjin on January 27th of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), allowing the research institutes to resume most of their work. Currently, the second batch of 162 boxes of books, instruments, and medicines has been transported from Kunming to Shanghai, and will soon be transported back to Beiping. In addition, there are about six or seven hundred more boxes of books and specimens in the Northwest, and books and instruments in Shanghai, which we cannot afford to transport back all at once. During the restoration, our institute purchased two private houses to use as staff dormitories. Mr. Su Chengqi contributed the most to the purchase of these dormitories. (To be continued)

### Prices Soar in Other Ports, Buying Interest is Strong: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Reach New Peaks, Rayon Up 15 Million Compared to Before the Holiday

[Our Report] Yesterday, although there was the news that yarn registration was beneficial to the yarn market, the market still rose frantically, because yarn prices in other ports were high, and Jinhan and other gangs had a strong intention to import. Local dyeing and weaving factories added raw materials due to the high price of cloth, and their appetite was very strong. Combined with new buyers participating, the market momentum was soaring. In the end, 42-count yarn rose by a huge 5.4 million yuan compared to before the holiday. It also created a new peak of 25 million yuan. 20-count special changes immediately rose by 2.2 million yuan, light changes immediately rose by 2.24 million yuan, 16-count Guangming rose by 2.26 million yuan, and the prices of other counts of thick and thin yarns also rose in unison by more than 2 million yuan to 2 million yuan.

Another report: Yesterday's cotton cloth market: The opening was flat and the undertone was firm, but because actual sales were very smooth in various places, and there were also outside parties coming in to purchase, Fang Jian sold low-end fine cloths, and the listed prices were greatly increased, but there were not many varieties. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth has not been supplied for a long time. Private dyeing factories and cloth factories have also reduced sales due to increased labor and material costs, resulting in a consistent rise in the prices of all cloths. In the end, all grades of fine cloth rose by 356,000 yuan compared to before the holiday, serge surged by 67,000 to 155,000 yuan, Shilin cloth also rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, and other bleached coarse cloths and colored cloths all reached new peaks.

Rayon has been hovering for several days, and it rose madly again yesterday. 120-count Asahi brand shiny 3A goods were only 61 million yuan at the opening, and 1A goods were 68 million yuan, but because news of favorable purchases from all parties frequently came, the rise continued. By the close of the midday market, the spot price had reached as high as 73 million yuan, and the afternoon price was sold at 76 million yuan, an increase of 15 million yuan compared to Thursday.

The factory quoted a retail price of 57.8 million yuan yesterday morning, but because rayon rose madly, people's hearts were prosperous, and everyone raised prices in unison.

Spot Cotton Rises

Yesterday's spot cotton market was firm and prices rose again. Because yarn and cloth rose sharply, people's hearts were high, and there was a strong desire to absorb. Because flower prices were too high, yarn factories were reluctant to import, so transactions were not prosperous, and most transactions were sporadic. The highest price for Lingshi was 4.46 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Huoji rose by 200,000 yuan, and other grades also followed up by about 100,000 yuan.

Yesterday, a total of more than 19,800 stones of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The market situation was very chaotic due to the rise in prices in the mainland and fluctuations in prices outside the market. Japonica and indica rice rose in unison by 450,000 yuan, and high-quality japonica has exceeded the 700,000 yuan mark. The allocation of flour is still only No. 3 flour, and the price remains the same, but there are many buyers in the market, and few suppliers, so the price has risen wildly by more than 10,000 yuan. The bran owners are also firm, with prices rising sharply by more than 10,000 yuan.

Soybean cakes are not left behind, and also follow the rise by 10,000 yuan. The stock of soybeans is low, and buyers are firm, continuing to rise by 230,000 yuan.

### Active Domestic Tea Sales

Domestic tea, which has been in high demand in this city and the Suzhou-Wuxi area for a long time, continued to be actively traded yesterday, further boosting confidence. Sellers are consistently raising prices, leading to a continued price increase. Although there have been inquiries about export varieties from exporters, prices have not been relaxed due to the impact of low overseas tea prices. Holders are increasingly firm in their willingness to sell, creating a situation of standoff between supply and demand, and transactions remain sluggish. Market sentiment is resistant to inactivity, with a general upward trend, but Keemun black tea, with ample supply, is in a holding pattern.

Hunan Tea Exports

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 10th] Tea is one of Hunan's export goods, with Anhua and Linxiang having the largest production. Since the war, sales have sharply decreased. After the victory, many tea companies were established, and the varieties have been improved daily. For example, Anhua black tea can already rival Keemun, but it is a pity that the products are not consistent. The Hunan Tea Company has already shipped tens of thousands of dan through Shanghai, which can be exported abroad. It is expected that sales can increase in the future.

### Market Sentiment Is Lively, and Ronghua Stocks Are Easy to Rise but Difficult to Fall

Yesterday, stimulated by the rise in gold, banknotes, and the black market, Chinese stocks showed a trend of being easy to rise but difficult to fall. Both China Merchants and Zhabei Cement had a large number of buyers, announcing a price ceiling, especially with the support of bank assistance for Zhabei Water and Electricity, which was even more profitable. Yongsha and other stocks retreated after rising, and it is still difficult for the trend of miscellaneous stocks to be universally good.

Morning Opening

Showing promise, No. 116 bought after the opening, and No. 94 and No. 130 respectively closed out spot and forward Yongsha. The price once fell from 308 yuan and 316 yuan to a low of 308 yuan for spot and 316 yuan for forward delivery. The black market for gold and banknotes was surprisingly hot, and the market sentiment was unstoppable. Under the absorption of No. 180 and others in Zhabei, it was very strong. No. 14 and others bought spot Yongsha, No. 32 and others bought forward Yongsha. China Merchants, Zhabei, and Cement were raised by No. 231, No. 152, and No. 149, respectively, to the price ceiling. The off-site interest rate also fell to 1.95 and 2.4. At 10:30, it rose to a high price of 326 yuan for spot and 330 yuan for forward delivery. After 10:40, there was news of loans again, and No. 85 and others sold off one after another, and began to fall back. Spot Yongsha was sold by No. 24, and forward delivery was closed by No. 218. Many retail investors also sold, and near noon, it fell to a low of 315 yuan and 319 yuan. No. 45 and others bought one after another, and then closed at prices of 319 yuan and 323 yuan. Zhabei was still absorbed by No. 152 and No. 180 and stood at the price ceiling. The rise in underclothing stocks was also high. As a result, compared with the spot stocks last Saturday, Zhabei rose to the price ceiling, and China Merchants Cement rose to the limit and then retreated, squeezing up by about 10%. Underclothing rose by 10%, Huajing Lunhao by 50%, Xinhua China Silk slightly fell, Hengying was flat, and the rest were slightly up. In terms of spot stocks, Meiya rose by less than 50%, and the rest were slightly up. The old stocks in the off-site market, except for Dasheng and others, were still flat, and the rest were trending upwards.

### Gradual Improvement in Exports: Optimistic Prospects for Our Raw Silk; Expected to Increase by 50,000 Dan Within Three Years

For this year's raw silk, the government has already started purchasing and is finding ways to sell it to various countries. According to Mr. Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Silk Company: There is no problem with this year's raw silk exports. Spring silk can collect 15,000 dan, and autumn silk was originally planned to be 5,000 dan, but due to price reasons, only 30% was collected, about 1,500 dan, totaling only over 16,000 dan. An American silk merchant alone purchases 500 dan of our raw silk every month. The United States currently has 60,000 bales of Japanese silk in stock, but still orders from us, which proves that our raw silk is still needed by Americans. The reason for this need is that our quality is higher than that of Japan. Our raw silk has its place in the international market.

At present, calculated according to the black market, our raw silk can be fully exported. Even calculated according to the market price, it is gradually approaching the actual cost, so the prospects for raw silk are quite optimistic. If we can continue to implement the silk weaving guidance plan, we will definitely be able to increase by 50,000 dan within three years, and can restore the pre-war quantity of 100,000 dan in five years. Domestic sales are also gradually increasing. Not only can silk and socks be woven, but silkworm cocoons can also be used for silk quilts and cotton robes, with a wide range of uses. General concerns are not a problem.

### National Bonds Slightly Rise, Foreign Stocks Rebound

Public bonds rose slightly yesterday. The unified bond C opened at 15,200 yuan in the morning. 552 and Dachengxing advanced to 15,900 yuan. 360 and 555 sold off, falling to 15,100 yuan and then selling. As a result, compared with before National Day, Class A and B bonds rose by 200 yuan, Class C and D bonds rose slightly by 100 yuan, and the unified bond E rose by 500 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 5 million.

Foreign stocks rebounded again yesterday due to the stimulation of gold and banknotes. Yisha opened at 180,000 yuan in the morning, reaching a high price of 190,000 yuan, and then struggled around 183,000 yuan. Bank assistance and retail investors bought in large numbers. As a result, compared with before National Day, Jardine Matheson and Swire rose by 10%, Yeguang Paper Industry and Copper Industry each rose by 50%, Yibier and Shipping were flat, and the rest rose slightly.

### Banks and Bureaus Continued to Ease Credit

[Our Dispatch] National banks and bureaus continued to issue 20.4 billion yuan at the bill exchange yesterday, and credit continued to ease.

In the small exchange, 34.1 billion yuan was withdrawn. In addition to the Bank of China withdrawing 75.1 billion yuan, most other banks and bureaus were contributing funds.

### This Year's Zhejiang Cotton and Linen Can Be Expected to Collect 80-90%

[Our Dispatch] Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, recently returned from inspecting the cotton and linen production areas in Zhejiang. According to him, this year's Zhejiang cotton and linen production area is drier, so it is expected that about 80-90% can be collected. This year's cotton production in the province is expected to reach about 350,000 dan. Among them, Dex cotton accounts for more than 10,000 dan, Tuo cotton accounts for more than 40,000 dan, and the rest are local cotton. The previous market price was mostly calculated based on the rice price, with Dex cotton at 10 jin of rice per jin, Tuo cotton at 7.5 jin of rice per jin, and local cotton at 6 jin of rice per jin. Recently, the rice price in the cotton production area is about 3,500 yuan per jin. In order to actively promote and expand next year, cotton production can reach 800,000 dan. In terms of linen production, the original target for this year was 300,000 dan, and now about 200,000 dan can be harvested. Compared with Indian and Taiwanese linen varieties, it is the most popular. Currently, one dan of linen is about half a dou.

### Agricultural Bank's Agricultural Loans for This Year Total Over 900 Billion

Loans for spring and autumn totaled over 400 billion, followed by cotton loans, which totaled over 130 billion. Ordinary agricultural loans totaled 100 billion, tea loans over 80 billion, tobacco loans 28 billion, plus various reconstruction loans in the Yellow River flood area, totaling over 900 billion.

Future business will continue to promote national policy, with production as the main loan target, because the only urgent task for our country today is to increase production. Fertilizers needed for grain production will be given special attention.

The morning loan plan for next year is being drafted and will be sent to the Four Banks Joint Office for final approval. The principles will not change, only technical issues and the amount of agricultural loans will be increased or decreased. However, the bank's funds are limited, and it is currently difficult to meet the needs of all parties, but it has fully fulfilled its responsibilities in the overall national policy.

### Tung Oil Shipped to the Soviet Union for Barter

The Central Trust Bureau is actively preparing to ship barter goods to the Soviet Union since the contract was signed. It is reported that tung oil is the main barter material from the Bureau to the Soviet Union. One thousand tons of tung oil in barrels were shipped from Shanghai the day before yesterday, and another 500 tons can be shipped by the end of this month. There are also 3,500 tons of tung oil in bulk, which the Bureau is purchasing from Sichuan and other places, totaling 5,000 tons. After this batch of tung oil is shipped, other materials will be shipped.

### National Grain Merchant Representatives Petition the Central Government Again

The initiators' meeting of the National Federation of Grain Trade Associations was held at 2:00 p.m. on the 10th at the South Rice Market. Grain associations from all over the country sent representatives to Shanghai to participate, with a total of more than 60 representatives. As a result, Huang Tongsheng, Chuan Changyu, Wan Molin, Wang Xingpu, Chen Jiali, Cai Yushu, Zhang Chao, Zhang Jingwei, Qu Zhenhua, and other twenty-one people were appointed as preparatory commissioners to organize the preparatory committee and promote all preparatory affairs. The discussion on continuing to request the government to exempt grain business tax lasted for a long time. It was unanimously believed that this was not a matter of grain alone, and directly and indirectly affected people's livelihood greatly. When a bag of rice is transshipped and sold, its business tax can be levied as many as three or four times, which is also one of the reasons for the rise in rice prices. Wang, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, is scheduled to convene representatives from chambers of commerce and grain associations from all over the country at 2:00 p.m. today to hold a joint meeting to discuss the matter in detail, and will send several representatives to Beijing again on behalf of merchants from all over the country to petition the government, requesting the government to immediately order the exemption of grain business tax in order to stabilize the people's food and the people's hearts.

### Character Depiction in "Ode to the Luo River Goddess"

— Li Baifeng

When I lecture on fu (rhapsody) in school, I often feel a common phenomenon that is almost the same everywhere. Needless to say, Qu Yuan's "Li Sao" is not as easily accepted by students as his "Nine Songs." Even Geng Zishan, the great master of fu, his "Lament for Jiangnan" and "Small Garden Fu" are not very popular with students. At that time, we were still fighting the war of resistance, and the scenes of displacement in "Lament for Jiangnan" can be said to be vividly written, but the students did not like it. Maybe it was because their understanding was not enough, or they had too little personal experience, I thought at the time.

However, whenever I talked about Cao Zijian's "Ode to the Luo River Goddess," surprisingly, it was always very popular with students. This is naturally not because I have any unique insights into the Ode, and the students are not stubborn stones either. They naturally find it easier to understand a divinely depicted article than some overly solemn and abstract articles. Therefore, it also enlightened my attention to and research interest in the depiction of figures in the Ode to the Luo River Goddess. Because of this attention (I have always been good at reading books without seeking thorough understanding), I realized that this Prince Chen Si, of whom people said, "The world's literature is one stone, and Zijian alone gets eight dou," made his name famous with the Ode, but it was just a piece of brocade assembled from various sources. However, he also has one advantage, that is, his plain sketches and group portraits of characters are all written so vividly and logically clear. Only this point, in terms of the composition of the writing and the depiction of figures, should be in the first class.

Here, for the sake of saving space, I will first talk about the advantages of his depiction of figures, and then give a few examples to see the organization and arrangement of this kind of sentence structure and the origin of the adjectives, so as to be used as a brick to attract jade for the erudite gentlemen who are interested in studying the "Ode to the Luo River Goddess":

The beginning of the Ode to the Luo River Goddess is no different from the atmosphere of the Wei and Jin Dynasties, so we don't have to pay attention to it. It is just a brief introduction saying how he passed the Luo River and wrote the fu because of his feelings for Zhen. However, in these short forty-one characters, it clearly tells us that it is just: "Feeling for Song Yu's story of the goddess of King Chu, I then wrote this fu." It can be seen that everything is a dream art of the daytime, and what he sees and hears are all completely fictitious. This was the beginning of the abuse of fu at that time, and it is not enough to be used as a basis.

First of all, what Cao Zijian showed us was a number of portraits of beauties, from far to near, with clear layers. In the section "Yu gao zhi ri" (On the day I told him) below, first is a plain sketch of an outline, and from "bian xian de zhong" (her proportions were well-balanced) onward, it is meticulous brushwork. The two sentences "Pian ruo jing hong, wan ruo you long" (Light as a startled swan, graceful as a swimming dragon) describe the "dynamic" state of the goddess when viewed from a distance. The two sentences "Rong yao qiu ju, hua mao chun song" (Radiant as autumn chrysanthemums, flourishing as spring pines) describe her static state. The following two sentences, "Fang fo xi, ruo qing yun zhi bi yue; piao piao xi, ruo liu feng zhi hui xue" (Seeming to float like light clouds veiling the moon; drifting like swirling snow in a flowing wind) also describe the former in a static state and the latter in a dynamic state. After this general description is finished, he uses two sentences to especially show the goddess's beauty when viewed from afar and up close: "Yuan er wang zhi, jiao ruo tai yang sheng zhao xia; po er cha zhi, zhuo ruo fu qu chu lu bo" (Viewed from afar, she is as radiant as the morning sun rising from the rosy clouds; observed from close up, she is as dazzling as a lotus flower emerging from rippling water). This kind of plain sketch of a figure can be said to be perfect.

Next, Cao Zijian used the meticulous painting method of Qiu Shizhou's meticulous beauties to meticulously sculpt a statue of the goddess of the Luo River, first writing from the figure to the face, and then returning to the clothing. It is truly a subtle description of classicism. Let's try to see:

"De zhong xiu duan he du, jian ruo xue cheng, yao ruo yue su" (Her height and shortness were well-proportioned, her shoulders like they were carved, her waist like tied silk); (describing the figure) "Yan jing xiu xiang, hao zhi cheng lu, fang ze wu jia, qian hua fu yu" (Her slender neck and fair nape were exposed, no fragrance was added, no powder was applied); (describing natural charm) "Yun ti e e, xiu mei lian juan, dan chun wai lang, hao chi nei xian; ming mou shan lai, fu cheng quan" (Her cloud-like hair was high, her slender eyebrows were connected, her red lips were bright, her white teeth were fresh; her bright eyes were good at glancing, her cheekbones supported her cheeks); (describing facial beauty) "Huan zi yan yi, yi jing ti xian, rou qing chuo tai, mei yu yu yan" (Her ringed posture was beautiful, her demeanor was quiet and her body leisurely, her soft emotions were graceful, charming beyond words); (describing beauty of demeanor) "Pi luo yi zhi chan xi, er yao bi zhi hua ju, dai jin cui zhi shou shi, zhui ming zhu yi yao ya; jian yuan you zhi wen qun, ye wu shao zhi chang ju" (She wore a silk robe of bright colors, earrings of jade and jasper, headdress of gold and kingfisher feathers, adorned with bright pearls to illuminate the belt; she walked on patterned shoes, trailing a mist-like skirt); (describing beauty of clothing)…"

This whole section is deliberately writing out the "static" beauty of the goddess of the Luo River, and below it describes her "dynamic" state and the relationship of the honor guard:

"Hu yan zong ti, yi yao yi xi" (Suddenly she gives way to her body, to invite and frolic); (moving like a fleeing rabbit) "Zuo yi cai mao, you yin gua qi" (Leaning on a colorful staff on the left, shielding with a hanging banner on the right); (honor guard)…"

Following closely, he also writes out his own feelings of "delighting in her beauty" and the action of "entrusting words through subtle waves," so the two hearts are in tune, close yet distant, written as if in a daze, hazy:

"Yu shi luo ling gan yan, xi yi pang huang, shen guang li he, zha yin zha yang" (Therefore the goddess of the Luo River was moved, drifting and hesitating, her divine light separated and converged, sometimes dark and sometimes bright); (the goddess's inner contradiction is manifested in her external image) "Song qing qu yi he li, ruo jiang fei er wei xiang" (Raising her light body like a crane standing, as if about to fly but not yet flying); (manifestation of an uneasy wavering psychology)"

Having written to this point, Cao Zijian suddenly writes with divine brushstrokes, turning movement from stillness. Having written that the goddess of the Luo River is moved and without a master, he continues with a long sigh to express eternal longing, or to decide on the company of her sisters; this is the most subtle way to write about a daughter's attitude. Therefore, it seems that eight dou of literary thoughts gush forth like a spring, suddenly rising and falling like a rabbit, and the pen like a swimming dragon directly pours out without reservation. This kind of pen that suddenly turns from the depiction of one person to the depiction of a group portrait, touching upon every branch and leaf, is truly impossible to catch up with:

"　　　　　　, ming　　chang" (summoning each other); "wei xi qing liu, ke　　qing, huo cai ming zhu, huo shi　yu" (Playing and laughing in the clear stream, they are admirable, some picking bright pearls, some picking jade feathers); (describing the dynamic state of the gods - group) "Ti xun fei niao, hu hu ruo shen, ling bi wei bu, luo mo sheng qing; dong wu chang ze, ruo wei ruo an, zi zhi nan qi, ruo wang ruo huan" (Their bodies are as swift as flying birds, and their movements are as sudden as gods, crossing over with subtle steps, their gauze skirts produce joy; their movements have no constant rules, sometimes dangerous and sometimes safe, their stopping is difficult to predict, sometimes going and sometimes returning); (describing the movement of the group - detailed writing, exhausting the ability to be boundless and hazy; the four "or" words in front, and the four "ruo" words in the back, echo each other, precisely because it is in conjecture, so using this kind of hesitant words, all the more increases its hazy beauty) "Han ci wei tu, qi ruo you lan, hua rong e nuo, ling wo wang sun" (Holding words yet unspoken, their breath is like a secluded orchid, their beautiful faces are graceful, causing me to forget my meals…); (describing a state of dazzling colors)."

From the above paragraphs, we can clearly see how Cao Zijian used the form of a narrative poem (I always like to compare fu to narrative poems, of course, in the past, the lyrical component in fu was still very heavy, perhaps because the Chinese nation has always valued the purely lyrical form?)

In these paragraphs, we can undoubtedly see that he focused on the depiction of figures; (of course, in "Gao Tang Fu," "Deng Tuzi's Love of Beauty Fu," and "Goddess Fu," they are also written in this way, which was naturally not created by Cao Zijian; regarding this aspect, we will briefly discuss it below) First of all, he writes out the distant and close appearance of the goddess of the Luo River, then writes the outline, then adds color, then writes from static to dynamic, and then writes the group portrait… Such a well-organized description is really worthy of our attention.

Regarding the benefits that the "Ode to the Luo River Goddess" gained from its predecessors, there are truly too many to count. Here I will only list a few key points and briefly cite them. If the reader has a mind to do so, it will not be difficult to understand the source of the words and sentences.

First of all, Cao Zijian's section of setting up the conversation, simulating the response between the edge of the Luo River and the driver, can be said to be completely using the old rules of "Gao Tang" and "Goddess" fu. Try to see:

"Hu yan si san, fu ze wei cha, yang yi shu guan, du yi li ren, yu qi zhi pan, nai yuan yu zhe er gao zhi yue: 'Er you guan yu bi zhe hu, bi he ren si, ruo ci zhi fei ye?' Yu zhe dui yue: 'Chen wen qiao he luo zhi shen, ming ri Mi Fei; ran ze jun wang suo jian, wu nai shi hu? Qi zhuang ruo he, chen yuan wen zhi'…" (Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River)

"Xi zhe, Chu Xiang Wang yu Song Yu you yu Yunmeng zhi tai… Wang yue: 'Xi zhe xian wang, zeng you Gao Tang, dai er hua qin,' Wang yue: 'Shi wei gua ren fu zhi'…" (Gao Tang Fu)

"Chu Xiang Wang yu Song Yu you yu Yunmeng zhi pu… Qi ye wang qin, guo meng yu shen nv yu, qi zhuang shen li, wang yi zhi, ming ri yi bai yu, Wang yue: 'Qi meng ruo he?'…" (Goddess Fu)

Here, we can see that the "Gao Tang" and "Goddess" fu both say the same story of King Xiang of Chu and Song Yu traveling in Yunmeng. The settings can be said to be completely similar, perhaps one thing was derived into two. As for the bathing goddess fu, it borrows no more than two points from the former: (1) using the dialogue between two people, followed by a fu on the beauty of a woman, (2) using the goddess to express secluded thoughts. In terms of narration, there is not much influence. But in the back, there are many places enough to see that Cao Zijian used the descriptive methods of his predecessors:

"Yuan er ting zhi, ruo zao feng he ming xi yun zhong; po er cha zhi, ruo zhong pa shu rong yao chun feng" (Listened to from afar, it is like a phoenix and a lark harmonizing and playing in the clouds; observed from close up, it is like many flowers blooming and illuminating the spring breeze)…" (Qin Fu)

"Yuan er wang zhi, jiao ruo tai yang sheng zhao xia; po er cha zhi, zhuo ruo fu qu chu lu bo" (Viewed from afar, she is as radiant as the morning sun rising from the rosy clouds; observed from close up, she is as dazzling as a lotus flower emerging from rippling water)…" (Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River) "Qi shi lai ye: Yao hu ruo bai ri chu chu zhao wu liang; qi shao jin ye, jiao ruo ming yue shu qi guang" (When she first comes, she shines like the white sun initially coming out to illuminate the house beams; when she advances slightly, she is as bright as the bright moon spreading its light)…" (Goddess Fu)

"Qi shi chu ye: Mang xi ruo song zhi, qi shao jin ye, zhe jin ruo jiao ji, yang mei zhang ri er wang suo si" (When she first emerges, she is blurred like a pine branch; when she advances slightly, she is as clear as a beautiful woman, raising her sleeves to block the sun and look at what she thinks of)…" (Gao Tang Fu)

The above are rough descriptions of the goddess in four fu (Qin fu describes the beauty of sound), and below we will look at their meticulous paintings:

"……Huai zi wei tai, bu ke sheng zan……Qi sheng shi ye: Ze luo zhi qi hui sheng wen zhang, ji fu miao cai zhao wan fang; zhen zhi yi, bei gui chang, li bu duan, xian bu chang, bu yi yi xi yao dian tang; hu xi gai rong, wan ruo you long cheng yun xiang……Gu fa duo qi, ying jun zhi xiang……Wen run zhi yu yan……Mei juan juan yi e yang xi, zhu chun zhuo qi ruo dan; su zhi gan zhi zhi shi xi, zhi jie tai er ti xian……" (Goddess Fu)

"……Chen jian jia zhi zi, zeng zhi yi fen ze tai chang, jian zhi yi fen ze tai duan; zhuo fen ze tai bai, shi zhu ze tai chi. Mei ru cui yu, ji ru bai xue; yao ru shu su, chi ru han bei……" (Deng Tuzi's Love of Beauty Fu)

"Nong xian de zhong, xiu duan he du, jian ruo xue cheng, yao ruo yue su; yan jing xiu xiang, hao zhi cheng lu. Fang ze wu jia, qian bi fu yu……Xiu mei lian juan, dan chun wai lang, hao chi nei xian……" (Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River)

As for the pen that writes about the mutual affection of the two, there are also quite a few similarities. Try to see:

"Sai yu wei er qing yu xi, yuan jin xin zhi juan juan……Chen jia ci er yun dui xi, tu fen fang qi ruo lan. Jing jiao jie yi lai wang xi, xin kai kang yi le huan; shen du xiang er zhu jie xi, hun qiong qiong yi wu duan." (Goddess Fu)

"Dong zhu chun yi xu yan, chen jiao jie zhi da gang……Kang luo mei yi yan ti xi, lei liu jin zhi lang lang……" (Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River)

Of course, these are not treating Cao Zijian as a literary plagiarist, because since the Han and Wei dynasties, it has indeed become a fashion to quote each other to prove one's point. For example, in the nineteen ancient poems, "Qing Qing He Pan Cao," "Qing Qing He Bian Cao," "Qing Qing Ling Shang Bo"… "Zhong You Chi Su Shu," "Nu Li Jia Sun Fan," etc., then it can be known that one person cannot shift the trend of the times.

The Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River naturally benefited from more than just these few articles. Traces can be found in the "Shuo Ren San Zhang" in the Book of Songs, the "Mountain Spirit" in the Chu Ci, as well as the Xiao Fu, Qin Fu, and Sheng Fu… We should not use this to spread rumors about Cao Zijian. It is precisely because of this that we know what is called "integration"!

In short, the artistic integrity of the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River is flawless, especially in using such a short fu to depict the image of a person. It not only shows that the skill is very deep, but also that the writing comes from divine inspiration! In addition, the strength of the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River is that Cao Zijian injected true emotions into it. Therefore, the article is written with poignant emotion and continuous thoughts, which is also beyond the reach of the superficial and exaggerated literature of the Wei and Jin dynasties.

Miscellaneous Notes from the Listening Frog Pavilion

The wild recluse Zai Shu says: "Du Fu's poems often did not conform to the rules, so matters that did not conform to the rules were called 'du zhuan' (杜撰, fabricated). However, looking at the popular expressions 'du tian' (杜田, fake field) and 'du guo' (杜國, fake country), the 'du' here means 'false.' For example, saying 'du jiu' (杜酒, fake wine) of one's own weak wine. This is the same meaning as 'du zhuan'."

Note: The characters 杜 (du) and 土 (tu) were commonly used interchangeably in ancient times. The Poetry Classic's "Xiao Yue" (鴞) says, "Che bi sang tu" (徹彼桑土, tear up that mulberry land); Guo Pu's annotation in the Fang Yan (方言, Regional Words) quotes it as "Che bi sang du" (徹彼桑杜). Also, the Poetry Classic's "Da Ya Mian" (大雅綿) says, "Zi tu ju qi" (自土沮漆, from the soil of Ju and Qi); Yan Shigu's annotation in the Hanshu (漢書, Book of Han) says that the Qi version of the poem says, "Zi du ju qi" (自杜沮漆). Also, "xiang tu" (相土, inspect the soil) is also written as "cheng du" (乘杜), and Yang Liang's annotation in the Xunzi (荀子) says, "Du is the same as tu." The Qing Teng Shan Ren's Lu Shi (路史) says, "Du, ben tu pu. Sang tu guo tu, bing yin qu sheng, gu xiang yan she tu er zhi yong du." (杜本土普。桑土國土，並音去聲，故相沿捨土而直用杜, Du originally means earth. Sang tu and guo tu are both pronounced in the falling tone, so people followed the custom of abandoning tu and directly using du.) The modern scholar Zhu Qifeng's Ci Tong (辭通) Volume 13 says, "Du cong tu sheng, gu yu yi tong tu, zuo yi tu you zuo yun du ye." (杜從土聲，故宇亦通土，作義土又作雲杜也, Du takes its sound from tu, so the word is also interchangeable with tu, meaning earth and also cloud du.)

Thus, what the world calls "du zhuan" is like saying "tu zao" (土造, made of earth), meaning it has no basis in the classics and comes from one's own private ideas. Homemade wine is called "du jiu," and creating words out of thin air is called "du zhuan," both meaning that they have no basis. Therefore, one should not simply say that it means "fake wine" or "fake creation."

Also, "Xiang Shan Ye Lu (湘山野錄) records that when Sheng Wenpiegong wrote the Shen Dao Stele for Wen Jie, Shi Canzheng Zhongli urgently asked, 'Who wrote it?' Sheng passed away and said, 'Du zhuan' (度撰, guessed). The whole hall burst into laughter. Since Wen Su was before Du Mo, he knew that the saying 'du zhuan' had existed for a long time."

Note: The response in the document is extremely clear. The so-called "du zhuan" means "zi zhuan" (自撰, self-composed). Later generations, not understanding that du and tu were interchangeable, seeing the words "du zhuan," insisted on dragging out a person named Du, such as Du Mo, to fabricate historical events, creating wild and distorted interpretations. The eras are inconsistent and impassable, thus causing the doubts of the Xiang Shan Ye Lu.

Creating a historical event about Du Mo as the root of the term "du zhuan," which is impassable, and then dragging out the affair of Du Tingguang, saying, "The Taoist canon has 5,000 volumes, but only the two volumes of the Tao Te Ching are genuine, and the rest were all composed by the Shu Taoist Du Tingguang, hence the term 'du zhuan'" (see Xiang Shan Ye Lu), is also uninformed.

No poet can write about something he has never experienced. — Ibsen. Xian Song

### One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"To tell you the truth, I've seen a lot of people like those two kinds. It's possible to find one or two people as beautiful as you and as capable as that young comrade in those packs of foxes and dogs. But they can't be as upright and steady as you two. Those guys, more or less, carry five parts wickedness and five parts baseness…"

This guy suddenly coughed violently, probably because he spoke too quickly and choked on his trachea. He hurriedly helped himself, grabbed the teapot and teacup on the table, waited on himself, and swallowed a big cup.

"…Later, when I got to the restaurant on Nanma Road, I inquired about the three kinds of dim sum you two ordered. Although they were quite substantial, including the small account, they only cost one yuan and twenty-three cents, which made my previous assumptions even clearer. But I still couldn't grasp what you two were. When I got to Bridge No. 2, you two parted ways, which then confirmed two points. You're either secret agents working for the Japanese or Chinese secret agents. But the former is just a reference. Like I said, with your two's mettle, you absolutely can't work as running dogs for the Japanese. Those things, ten out of ten, are all crooked-eyed and have the bones of a dog… So you two must be on the side of the Chinese…"

"That young comrade is really amazing. His legs can truly be called flying legs! I was riding my bicycle and almost ran out of breath. I caught up in front and followed you for about two miles before I was sure of your actions. That young master is overly alert, and even with someone as experienced as me, dodging here and there, I still couldn't escape his attention. On the one hand, I was still worried about this end, so I hurried back…" Speaking of which, this guy cracked open his purplish-green thick lips again, and slanted his two sunken eyes, giggling:…
