### Economic Emergency Measures Plan to be Submitted to National Defense Committee Today for Discussion; Finance Minister Yu Discusses Recent Gold Rush Factors

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a dinner at his official residence at 8:00 PM on the 15th for key government officials, including Yu Yu-jen, T.V. Soong, O.K. Yui, and Wang Yun-wu, all of whom accepted the invitation. During the dinner, they discussed important economic and political issues at length, and the gathering adjourned around 10:00 PM.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The main topics for discussion at the Supreme National Defense Committee meeting to be held at 9:00 AM on the 16th will be the election law drafted by Wang Chong-hui and emergency measures to address the current economic situation. If the election law is passed by the National Defense Committee, it will still need to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The government's drafted economic emergency measures have been finalized after two discussions by the Economic Policy Research Committee of the Central Party Headquarters on the 15th. That evening, Premier Soong presented them to Chairman Chiang for review, and they are expected to be submitted to the special session of the National Defense Committee at 4:00 PM on the 16th. Fundamental solutions will be considered at length and implemented later. The first meeting of the Economic Policy Committee was held at 10:00 AM on the 15th at the Central Party Headquarters, attended by T.V. Soong, Tai Chuan-hsien, Hsu Kan, Chen Lifu, Xiao Zheng, O.K. Yui, Liu Jianqun, He Zhonghan, Huang Yuanbin, Lou Tongsun, and Li Junlong. Chairman Chen Lifu made a comprehensive review of the gold speculation and price issues. The majority agreed that the price issue should be addressed fundamentally and not be limited to public educators or a few locations. The first meeting adjourned around 1:00 PM, and the meeting continued at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, still chaired by Chen Lifu. After a two-hour meeting, a final decision was made on the economic emergency measures.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The government will stop production loans to prevent speculators from manipulating them.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Yu Hongjun attended a special session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th to report on the causes of the current gold rush and the measures the government will take to address it. He stated that various government departments have been busy drafting a comprehensive plan to stabilize the financial situation and secure the people's livelihood, to control prices and suppress speculation from both positive and negative aspects, in order to eliminate the various factors disrupting the financial situation. This plan is expected to be submitted and announced at the special session of the Supreme National Defense Committee on the 16th. He believes that the market will inevitably tend to stabilize after implementation. Yu stated that gold policies should be adapted to the times and circumstances, and that the current policy does need to be re-evaluated. The government's implementation of the gold policy aims to absorb floating capital, to restore confidence in the legal tender, and to stabilize prices. Although gold prices are not related to commodity prices, they can have some impact on people's confidence. In the past one or two years, China has used this policy to absorb a considerable amount of floating capital, but since the end of last year, a gold rush has been triggered due to the following two reasons:

(1) Several Shanghai businesses distributed welfare funds, with each person receiving 2 to 3 million, which suddenly increased floating capital and led to a rush to buy gold.

(2) Rumors spread that the central bank's gold reserves were empty, but the fundamental reason was the machinations of floating capital. This is a manifestation of the overall economic problem in the financial sector. To solve it, one cannot focus solely on the financial aspect. The entire plan is being drafted by the Ministries of Finance, Food, Social Affairs, and Economics, and it can be submitted tomorrow. Yu solemnly pointed out that the central bank still holds a large amount of gold reserves, enough to meet market needs; however, the entire gold policy is under review; therefore, whether to continue to sell large quantities in the future is still under discussion. Situ Dede asked him to announce the amount of gold reserves and asked if the government had statistics on the floating capital. Yu said that the central bank's gold reserves are sufficient to meet market needs. As for the amount of floating capital, it cannot be verified because it is constantly moving. However, the government will take effective steps to limit it from concentrating in Shanghai from remote areas.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] After a resolution, Pan Xulun explained the current economic measures at the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th, pointing out that if the economic situation continues to deteriorate due to the gold rush, the government will be forced to consider taking some regulatory steps to stabilize prices. During the war, the government implemented controls in the rear, which greatly contributed to the control of prices in various places. Recent events in Shanghai have also proven that controls have a good impact on prices. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is now considering how to use the existing valid regulatory laws to prevent hoarding and speculation. Pan believes that in this extraordinary economic period, tolerating excessive freedom will only worsen the situation; however, China has a vast territory and many types of materials, and regulatory work that only addresses minor issues will inevitably be ineffective.

### Exchange Rate Between Taiwan Currency and Legal Tender Changed to One to Sixty

Xiong Shihui told reporters.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Ganza Office, met with more than 20 reporters in the office's conference room on the 14th. He answered all the questions raised one by one. Regarding the central government's negotiations on receiving Dalian and Harbin, Xiong replied that there were no diplomatic issues regarding the two cities and there was no need to negotiate further; he was only awaiting government orders before proceeding to take over.

Q: The communist troops are currently harassing everywhere in the Northeast. Will there be large-scale movements?

A: In terms of the strength of the national army, the communist troops cannot take any action in the Northeast; however, the highest authorities hope to resolve the issue of reception through political means as much as possible.

Q: What is your opinion on the export of soybeans from the Northeast?

A: Soybeans should be exported in large quantities, but due to price fluctuations within the country, there is a huge price difference for soybeans. I hope to obtain profits from this price difference, but without stimulating other prices. Reporters continued to ask about the candidates for deputy director of the office. Has the central government made a decision? Xiong said that the central government has not yet announced it. Finally, reporters inquired about the changes to the boundaries of the nine provinces and regions in the Northeast. Xiong said that it was too early and that he intended to adjust the small, intertwined areas after all nine provinces had been taken over.

### Communist Troops Cross the Songhua River; Qitamu Falls Again

[Our Changchun Office, 15th] The communist offensive north of the Songhua River has begun again. Qitamu, on the west bank of the Songhua River, was captured again yesterday by communist troops crossing the river. Using more than 20 horse-drawn carts, they looted grain and destroyed the local police station's communications equipment.

[Our Changchun Office, 15th] On the 13th, communist troops in mixed uniforms invaded Xizhuang, Wuxuantong, ninety miles east of Jiutai.

### Measures for Rationing Daily Necessities; First Priority Given to Public Servants and Their Families; Students, Military Police, etc. to be Handled Separately

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Responsible persons from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Food, and other agencies continued to meet at the Ministry of Economic Affairs at 3:00 PM on the 15th to discuss the rationing of daily necessities for public educators. After some minor revisions, the draft was fully approved. It may be submitted to the National Defense Committee on the 16th. Today's meeting was chaired by Pan Xulun, and the measures for rationing daily necessities for public servants were also discussed. It was reportedly decided that each public servant and their family can receive five dou of rice, one dan of coal, two catties of sugar, five zhang of blue cloth every six months, four catties of salt, and three catties of oil per month; if approved by the National Defense Committee, it will also be implemented from March 1st. The prices will be based on the end of December last year. Furthermore, this rationing is temporarily limited to public educators, and students and military police will be handled separately. The rationing measures for employees in production and transportation will also be studied.

### Marshall Hosts Reporters, Reviews China's Economic Situation, Says Currency Value Has Less Impact on Farmers

[US News Agency, Washington, 15th] US Secretary of State Marshall made a statement on China's economic problems at a press conference, as follows:

"China's currency system has long been in a dire state, and it is becoming increasingly serious. When I first came to China, the exchange rate was 1,600 legal tender to one US dollar. The situation was already extremely serious at that time, and it is even worse now.

When reviewing the state of China's currency system, one point is worth considering: the majority of the Chinese population are farmers, and they are not as directly affected by the currency system as the American people. The situation is extremely serious in Shanghai and Nanjing, but in rural areas, farmers cultivate and eat, and their relationship with economic difficulties does not seem to be very close."

A reporter asked Marshall what impact it would have on US import and export trade if China banned the circulation of US dollars. Marshall believes that opinions on this are inconsistent in all aspects, so it is difficult to make a hasty conclusion.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Secretary of State Marshall announced today while hosting reporters that economic advisors at the State Department have advised him not to interfere with this matter. However, whether the US government should aid China, and if so, the nature of the aid, has not been decided. There is also no indication when aid can be implemented. Mr. Marshall just had a top-level meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is said that they discussed most of the troubled areas of the world and reported to the committee that the world situation is very dangerous. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said that Mr. Marshall's report was very informative and exciting. Mr. Marshall spoke with the committee for an hour and a half, but he did not want to announce the details.

US Export-Import Bank Denies Loan Rumors

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The US Export-Import Bank today denied rumors circulating among Chinese people in Shanghai that "the US government will be willing to lend 500 million early to China." A spokesman for the bank said, "As far as I know, that report from Shanghai has no basis whatsoever." In April 1946, the US Export-Import Bank allocated $500 million for possible future loans to China to aid in China's reconstruction plan. The bank is the only institution that the US government can order to lend to China. According to US political elbow officials, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, while theoretically able to lend to China, is practically unable to do so.

### Xu Xiangqian's Nephew, Zhang Junde, Defects

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th] Zhang Junde, a cultural and educational cadre in the Health Department of the CCP's Southern Hebei Detachment, is Xu Xiangqian's nephew. Realizing the Communist Party's conspiracy to bring disaster to the country and unwilling to be tainted, he resolutely surrendered to the government and wrote to his uncle, earnestly explaining the advantages and disadvantages.

### Report of Fang Xianjue's Capture is Inaccurate

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] A reporter recently inquired with relevant departments of the Ministry of National Defense about the report of Fang Xianjue's capture. According to reports, this is a rumor and there is absolutely no such thing.

### Councilors Committee Reviews Financial and Economic Proposals; Principles Agreed Upon, to be Discussed Again Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Councilors Committee held a meeting of the Financial and Economic Proposal Review Committee at 9:00 AM on the 15th, attended by more than ten people including Fu Sinian, Qian Gonglai, Yin Shuxian, and Luo Heng. Chairman Mo Dehui announced that the committee had received a total of nine financial and economic proposals, eight of which related to gold policy and price stabilization, and one related to foreign exchange. The discussion was not completed in the morning and continued in the afternoon. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM. It is reported that after the conclusions were organized, they will be submitted to the Councilors Committee for discussion on the 17th. The main points of the two important proposals and conclusions are as follows: (1) Yin Shuxian and others requested the government to quickly dispatch impartial people to thoroughly investigate the selling price of gold and foreign exchange in order to stop the rise in prices. The method is as follows: A. Please ask the government to quickly dispatch socially impartial people or entrust this committee to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the numbers of gold and foreign exchange sales and investigate whether the central bank president, Bei Zuyi, has engaged in fraud. B. All merchants who hoard and speculate and improperly purchase large amounts of gold and foreign exchange should be punished with the death penalty for the crime of disrupting the financial system, and their property should be confiscated. C. Please ask the government to re-examine the gold policy and suspend all gold and foreign exchange trading until regulatory measures are formulated. (2) Da Pusheng and others proposed suppressing price increases. The method is as follows: A. Prohibit gold trading. B. Implement a planned economy. C. Implement the collection of property taxes to increase national revenue. D. Please ask the government to send personnel to investigate how much bureaucratic capital is operating and at the same time investigate who is manipulating the financial system to allow gold and US dollars to wreak havoc and publicize it in various newspapers. E. The gold rush has caused prices to suddenly increase by seven or eight times or more. The real situation of the people's suffering should be reported to Chairman Chiang. The main points of the conclusions obtained from the discussion are as follows: (1) Please ask the government to strictly stipulate that gold and US dollars must not be used as a medium of exchange. (2) Immediately suspend gold trading. (3) Those who use gold or foreign currency to order goods or purchase houses domestically should be punished for the crime of disrupting the financial system. (4) Foreign exchange must not be traded in the market. (5) Please ask the government to have the Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and Councilors Committee jointly organize an investigation team to investigate the real situation of foreign exchange. (6) If the results of the investigation are true, they should be severely punished.

### Legislators Formally Recommend Government Nationalize Gold, Control Foreign Currency; Legislative Yuan to Invite Premier Soong to Attend Next Week's Meeting

Many Questions on Gold Policy

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Legislative Yuan held a special meeting on the morning of the 15th to review the gold policy. President Sun Ke presided over the meeting, attended by more than 70 legislators, Yu Hongjun, and Pan Xulun. At the consultation meeting, each legislator severely criticized the government's gold policy, unanimously believing that this policy not only failed to stabilize prices but also led to an increase in the prices of all goods and should be stopped immediately. Zhou Yizhi pointed out that the method of deducting gold savings certificates was inappropriate, believing that this would cause the people to lose confidence in the government and was extremely unwise. As for the foreign exchange adjustment, it should have been implemented two months ago. Repeated delays caused overseas remittances to flee to Hong Kong. The recently implemented export subsidy policy actually harmed genuine producers. Chen Guyuan criticized the government for only helping unscrupulous capitalists to profit and for fueling bureaucratic capital. The government's previous adjustments to foreign exchange all had underlying reasons. Last Mid-Autumn Festival, because some unscrupulous merchants had difficulty obtaining festivals, they adjusted foreign exchange to help them get through the festival. As a result, the price of gold rose from 180,000 to 280,000. At this critical juncture, the government should take emergency measures to make a thorough change in its policies in order to save some vitality for the country. Wei Tingsheng said that the so-called gold policy cannot become a policy at all. Its initial intention was to stabilize prices, but the result was to lead to higher prices. It is inherently contradictory and unprecedented both domestically and internationally. He believes that the government abandoned the right path and did not start with issuing public bonds, but only focused on issuing banknotes, which led to a dead end.

Exchange Rate Too Low, Exports Stagnant

At the same time, the exchange rate is so low that goods cannot be exported, and foreign goods are constantly coming in. Industry and commerce cannot survive, and the countryside is withering away. Floating capital is flocking to the market, causing such a big wave. Situ Dede believes that if the government has no statistics on the total amount of floating capital, it will be difficult to achieve results by continuing the gold policy. According to his estimate, the total amount of floating capital concentrated in Shanghai solely for gold trading is as high as 90 million. Sun Jiulu pointed out that after the implementation of this foreign exchange subsidy policy, the US dollar is equivalent to a 75% price increase, and the price of gold also rises, resulting in the current gold rush. Zhong Tianxin and others also expressed dissatisfaction with the various measures of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, believing that the Ministry only focused on raising prices and did not adopt controls. The government loudly advocated supporting private factories, but private factories could not survive, which was painful for relatives. Chen Changheng and others believed that in order to cope with this gold rush, the government was rumored to be drafting an emergency measure, which would be best if it could be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review first. The proposal of Liu Butong and others to nationalize gold and US dollars was discussed at today's meeting and it was decided to send it to the Finance and Economics Committee for review. The resignation of the nine-member committee has been approved.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The 314th meeting of the Legislative Yuan continued from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM this morning, reviewing the government's financial and economic policies. President Sun Ke chaired the meeting, and Yu Hongjun and Pan Xulun were invited to attend. Yu answered many questions and left the meeting at 10:40 AM. Pan Juechang then gave an overview of the economic situation. He also answered questions about the profits of the China Textile Company and the recent situation of the Fuel Management Committee for an hour. Finally, President Sun announced that a special meeting would be held next Thursday or Friday, inviting Premier Soong to attend and report on financial and economic development facilities. Earlier, Minister Yu had conveyed to the Legislative Yuan that Mr. Soong had decided to come to the Legislative Yuan for instruction in two weeks. Legislators are collecting materials and preparing to ask questions.

Reasons for Two Major Proposals

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Legislators Liu Butong, Li Qingchen, Cheng Yuanzhen, Jian Guansan, Chen Haicheng, Chen Zifeng, Dai Xiujun, Huang Yunsu, and others submitted the following two proposals by temporary motion. After discussion, it was resolved to submit them to the Finance and Economics Committee for review. The original proposals are as follows:

(1) It is recommended by this Yuan that the Supreme National Defense Committee order the Executive Yuan to close the gold market, stop gold trading, and nationalize all gold. The reasons are as follows: - Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, gold and legal tender have been completely separated. The government's use of the gold policy to reduce the amount of legal tender must be effective under the condition that currency inflation stops. Now that currency inflation cannot be stopped, the gold policy has lost its effectiveness. If this policy is continued at present, it will lose the country's useful gold and provide opportunities for wealthy classes to speculate and make money. 2 Although gold and legal tender have no associated relation at present, the rise in gold prices can still stimulate prices, but the fall in gold prices cannot make prices fall. This is the fact that these occured for several months. In recent times, the Floating capital has been causing trouble, competing to buy gold, causing the price of gold to skyrocket and prices to rise as well. If there is no gold transaction at all and other methods are used to bring Floating capital into the normal track, there will be no such phenomenon. After the gold market is closed, the government will announce a gold nationalization policy and prohibit gold exports. Those who have gold can automatically hand over the gold to the state, and the state will give it a corresponding price or government bond coupons at a corresponding price.

(2) It is recommended by this Yuan that the Supreme National Defense Committee order the Executive Yuan to announce that all foreign currencies should be nationalized and implement a planned foreign trade policy. The reasons are as follows:

1 The malpractice of buying and selling foreign currencies is the same as the gold policy, so it should be stopped. After nationalizing all foreign currencies at a corresponding price, foreign nationals holding foreign currencies should exchange them for legal tender at our central bank to curb speculation in domestic foreign currency trading and avoid stimulating prices.

2 The current method of controlling foreign exchange in our country is that exporters must sell the foreign exchange they earn to the central bank at a legal price, and importers must apply to the central bank. However, because the legal price is too low, exporters suffer too much losses, which affects export trade. Therefore, the government now has a policy of subsidizing exporters by 100%. However, regardless of the effect of this method, its impact is to make wealth more concentrated and the distribution more uneven, which is not beneficial to the country and society.

3 Importers can make huge profits from importing goods due to high domestic prices. Although there are restrictions on application procedures, for the purpose of profit-making, they can still smuggle or collude with application agencies to engage in fraud, which cannot be limited. Therefore, in order to eliminate malpractices, import trade should also adopt a planned system.

### National Army Enters Linyi Yesterday; Remnants of Communist Troops Flee in Three Routes; Nationalists Also Recovered Dingtao in Western Shandong at the Same Time

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] After four hours of fierce fighting, the National Army entered Linyi, an important town in southern Shandong, at 7:00 AM on the 15th. The remnants of the communist troops fled to Mengyin and Sishui in the northwest of the city. The National Army entering the city comforted the people while clearing the remnants of the communist troops in the city, and sent powerful troops to track and pursue them.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The remnants of Liu Bocheng's communist troops continued to retreat across Dingtao towards Yuncheng. The National Army recovered Dingtao on the afternoon of the 15th and took advantage of the victory to pursue them, hoping to completely resolve them on the south bank of the Yellow River. It is said that Liu led more than 10,000 rear personnel to escape to Shouzhang on the north bank of the Yellow River three days ago.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 14th] The main force of the communist troops Xie Si and Xie Jiu divisions defending the front of Linyi began to retreat to the mountainous area southeast of Linyi on the 14th. There are no major communist troops harassing within Ganyu. Furthermore, the National Army moving south from Xinzhai entered the outskirts of Mengyin on the 14th.

[Our Jinan Office, 14th] In central Shandong, the National Army advancing to near Aoyang Town south of Xintai was greatly reinforced by communist troops, and a part of 5,000 communist troops fled north from Mengyin, attempting to attack the flank of the National Army. Therefore, the battle in the area is still ongoing in the original area, while the outskirts of Jinan are as calm as ever.

National Army Enters the City; People Rejoice

[Our Jinan Office, 15th] The elite troops of Li Tianxia and Zhang Lingfu, two of the five tiger generals personally cultivated by Wang Yaowu, formally recovered Linyi City at 10:00 AM on the 15th. Linyi is the base of the New Fourth Army, the second strongest force of the CCP, and also the location of the CCP's East China Bureau, the pseudo-Shandong Provincial Government, and the Shandong Military Region, that is, the CCP's military and political center north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River. Its importance to the CCP is second only to Yan'an and exceeds Jiamusi in the Northeast. It is also the Yan'an of East China. The defeat of the communist troops in Linyi is of great significance and has a serious impact, not only far exceeding the previous failures in northern Jiangsu and Zhangjiakou, but also far exceeding the failures in Siping Street and Changchun in the late spring of last year. Linyi has been occupied by communist troops for seven years. Today, when the city saw the light of day once again, the people rejoiced madly. Chen Yi led the remnants of the troops to flee in three routes to the Yimeng Mountains. One route fled from Mengyin to Sishui, one route rushed from Liangqiu to Zou County, and one route from Fei County also went to Sishui. According to his intentions, or will have a slightly rest and reorganize in the mountainous areas of southern Shandong, and then cross the Jinpu Railway to flee westward and join Liu Bocheng. Because Wang Yaowu's army group has firmly blocked the northern foot of the Yimeng Mountains, it is impossible to go north. Chen Yi's New Fourth Army originally had six basic divisions, four new divisions, three liberation divisions, and ten columns. According to official estimates, the total number of losses is 16 brigades, seven columns, and six regiments, which is about the total military force.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The center of the Beijing-Shanghai war has shifted from southern Shandong to northern Jiangsu. 100,000 communist troops are fiercely attacking Xinpu west of Haizhou. There is a major battle in the vicinity. When reporters asked the Ministry of National Defense spokesman about this, they were informed that this was completely untrue and was a communist rumor.

### Statement by the Democratic Socialist Party on Participation in Four Government Organizations; Total of 44 Personnel Selected

[Central News Agency, this city report] Regarding the participation of the China Democratic Socialist Party in the reorganized Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Party and Government Implementation Promotion Association, and Political Council, the following statement was specially issued yesterday: Since the Party's participation in the Political Consultative Conference, it has been committed to seeking peace and democracy for China, because without peace and unity, all political facilities and financial rectification cannot be started. Later, when negotiations stalled, the government announced the date for convening the National Assembly, and the "third party" gathered in Nanjing again to seek mediation. At that time, the smoke of war filled the land, and nothing could be said about peace talks without first ceasing fire. However, once a ceasefire was involved, issues such as troop deployments and local government power would arise accordingly, thus military affairs involved political affairs, and political affairs involved military affairs again, entangled with each other endlessly; and the Chinese Communist Party did not agree to the original date for the convening of the National Assembly, nor did it negotiate another date. Under these circumstances, the government intends to end the period of political tutelage and formulate a constitution, which is a step closer to democracy. Therefore, the Party nominated candidates for the National Assembly to participate in the constitutional drafting work, in order to lay the foundation for democratic politics; when the constitution was completed, the smoke of war in the country still did not subside. The government believes that there is still considerable time before the date of constitutional implementation, and issues related to constitutional implementation, such as the formulation of election laws and other laws, are beyond the ability of the government during the period of political tutelage. It is necessary for the participation and cooperation of other parties to meet the expectations of people across the country. Therefore, it was decided to reorganize the government and firmly invite the Party to nominate participants; at this transitional period, the Party can only work with a spirit of cooperation to achieve the goal of participating in the Legislative Yuan and the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, which is an inescapable duty. The duties of the Control Yuan also require some correction of the politics of the transitional period. The Political Council is an organization for collective wisdom during wartime, and various parties have long been present. Therefore, the purpose of participation is to bring politics onto the right track of democracy and the rule of law! After several discussions, the Party believes that since it participated in the constitutional drafting, participation in the preparatory work for constitutional implementation is necessary to fulfill its responsibilities. Therefore, it unanimously decided to participate in the reorganized Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, and Political Council to live up to the people's desire to gradually enter the rule of law and governance; as for bearing the responsibilities of decision-making and administration, it will wait until all parties in the country are unanimously committed to peace and democracy (February 15, 36th year).

[Also reported] The number of places for the Democratic Socialist Party to participate in the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Political Council, and Promotion Association was originally set at 34. Now, the number of participants in the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association has increased from 5 to 15. Therefore, the total number of participants from the Party in the four organizations has also increased to 44. According to Mr. Feng Jinbai of the Party, the list of the Party's participants in the four organizations, such as the Legislative Yuan, has been selected and finalized. Party members who should be elected far away in North China, the Americas, and other places have replied by telegram, and all participating personnel lists will be brought to Nanjing by Mr. Jiang Yuntian within days for submission to the government. As for the participating personnel, they will take office in Beijing as soon as the government announces their names.

[Also reported] Mr. Zhang Dongsun, Director of the Secretariat of the Democratic League, is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 19th on an American military plane to return to Yanjing University to continue teaching. His vacant position in the Democratic League will be temporarily filled by Mr. Huang Yanpei.

### American Journalist Delegation Arrives in Shanghai for Visit; Howard Believes the CCP Still Lacks Sincerity in Seeking Peace; The Group Scheduled to Fly to the Philippines and Return Home This Morning

[This newspaper reported] Mr. Howard, a giant in the American newspaper industry, and nine other American newspaper leaders, at the invitation of the U.S. Army Department, toured various regions of the Pacific. Yesterday, they arrived in Shanghai by car from Beijing. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Howard and others visited Mayor Wu at 10:30 a.m. to conduct a wide-ranging review of the economic and political situation in Shanghai, and expressed their admiration for Mayor Wu's spirit of perseverance in promoting various municipal measures in difficult circumstances. At noon, Mr. Howard and others attended a luncheon hosted by the Western Journalists Association of this city at its clubhouse in the Broadway Building. In the afternoon, they attended a cocktail party hosted by U.S. Consul General Davis, where U.S. Commercial Counselor Corder, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Smith, and American Evening Post Chief Editor Gould reported on the political, economic, and security situation in China.

According to Mr. Howard's statement to this newspaper's reporter, the American public's opposition to the U.S. government's "softening" policy toward the Soviet Union has recently become more intense. Mr. Howard also said that the American public deeply feels that it may be very difficult to organize a coalition government in China under the current circumstances, and it is also difficult to find a reasonable solution for the transfer of Marshal Marshall. He also said that Marshal Marshall's recall to the country is a natural development in the political situation. According to Mr. Howard's personal observation, the CCP has failed to sincerely express its sincerity in the ceasefire negotiations, which has led to the stagnation of the peace talks. Chairman Chiang and the central government are often constrained by the agreements in the negotiations, which allows the CCP to take advantage of military opportunities.

At 8 p.m. last night, American journalists here jointly hosted a banquet at the Broadway Building to welcome and bid farewell to Mr. Howard and others.

Mr. Howard and others flew to Beijing from Japan the day before yesterday and met with Chairman Chiang in Beijing for an hour and a half to discuss the domestic and international situation in our country. Mr. Howard and others are scheduled to take a U.S. Army Department connecting flight to Manila at 8 a.m. this morning for sightseeing and will inspect Honolulu before returning to the United States.

Mr. Howard and others, most of whom are visiting this ancient country in the Far East for the first time, went to the market yesterday afternoon to select exquisite and beloved souvenirs.

The list is expected to be submitted before the 20th.

### Our Journalist Delegation to Visit Japan

A Group of Ten to Depart Within Days

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Chinese government, at the invitation of the MacArthur Headquarters stationed in Japan, has organized a Chinese journalist delegation to visit Japan. It is heard that they will depart within days.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] The Jilin Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has now started the reconstruction project of the First Songhua River Iron Bridge, which is 440 meters long and the third-longest bridge in Northeast China.

Rice Hoarding Case Judged for Local Redistribution

[This newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] According to a phone call from Mudu: The Suzhou County Government sent personnel to the Mudu Grain Collection Office on the 15th for investigation, which lasted for three hours.

The amount of over-collected grain should be around 100,000 catties, and the signs of corruption seem obvious.

[This newspaper, Suzhou] Xu Zhuyi, the current County Magistrate of Jiading, was recently accused by someone to the local District Prosecutor's Office of two crimes: corruption and obstructing freedom.

After Xu County Magistrate learned about it, he immediately arrested the farm owner Shao Baosan and sent him to the Suzhou Higher Prosecutor's Office for investigation. However, Shao's family believed that Xu County Magistrate had falsely accused him and filed a complaint with the local District Prosecutor's Office.

### Chairman Chiang Orders the Customs to Handle Through Navigation of the Qiantang River to the Sea; Setting up Markers to Facilitate Sea Imports and Exports

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Since the ocean liner Tang En broke through the cage gate shoals and first sailed into the Qiantang River, all parties have been very concerned about the passage of the Qiantang River waterway. Mayor Zhou sent a detailed letter to Chairman Chiang about this matter. According to Mayor Zhou, Chairman Chiang has ordered the customs authorities to survey the water level and set up navigation markers to facilitate the import and export of ocean liners to the Qiantang River, so that the products of the upper Jiangxi and Jiangxi areas can be transported smoothly to Shanghai and Hangzhou, prospering commerce.

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Xue Dubi, Chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, came to Hangzhou to inspect the seawalls and went to Haining today to inspect the key seawalls along the river. According to Mr. Xue's statement to this newspaper's reporter, the Qiantang River seawall is the second largest project in the country after the Yellow River, and it is closely related to the lives and property of the people in Jiangnan. Therefore, he urgently hopes to complete it as soon as possible. However, due to funding constraints, the implementation of the fundamental plan is still pending. If the country can be safe as soon as possible, the plan can also be realized earlier. China's construction industry needs 50 years of hard work to modernize. Currently, we can only endure and work hard. As for the transfer of the Seawall Bureau to the central government, the Executive Yuan's approval still belongs to the provincial government. However, the local financial resources are insufficient and must be subsidized by the central government. Therefore, he will go to Beijing with Pi Zuoqiong, Director of the Construction Department, tomorrow to negotiate with the Executive Yuan.

Editorial

### China Once Again Suffers Humiliation!

The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting in London convened on the 14th to discuss whether China should be a convener of the peace conference with Germany. The representatives of Britain, the United States, and France unanimously advocated that the four major powers and China should all be conveners of the peace conference with Germany. However, the Soviet representative, Gusev, disregarded the opposition of the British, American, and French representatives, maintained his original stance, and reiterated his reason, stating: "Only the four major powers that signed the German instrument of surrender, namely Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, can be considered conveners of the peace conference with Germany." This resulted in the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting failing to reach an agreement on this matter.

Regarding this issue, during the final meeting of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting in New York to decide on the agenda of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes proposed inviting China to attend the next Foreign Ministers' meeting to participate in drafting the peace treaty with Germany. However, this suggestion was resolutely opposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, thus leaving the suggestion unresolved internationally. Moreover, Foreign Minister Molotov even opposed China being one of the conveners of the peace conference with Germany. The reason he gave was that the Potsdam Declaration stipulated that only countries that signed the German instrument of surrender could participate in drafting the peace treaty with Germany.

The reason given by the Soviet side is untenable, both legally and morally. Legally speaking, the most important provision of the Potsdam Declaration was to establish a Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Council to be responsible for negotiating peace treaties with the six enemy countries in Europe and proposing solutions to territorial issues arising from the end of the European war. It only stipulated that the drafting of the peace treaty should be carried out by member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council that had signed the instrument of surrender. Even the joint declaration of the three Foreign Ministers in Moscow stipulated that after the drafting of the peace treaty was completed, the Foreign Ministers' Council would convene a 21-nation peace conference to discuss the draft peace treaty and make recommendations. According to this, the drafting of the peace treaty should indeed be carried out by the countries that signed the instrument of surrender, but the peace conference to discuss the draft peace treaty should be convened jointly by the five member states of the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Council. Therefore, China may not participate in the drafting of the peace treaties with the six enemy countries in Europe, but the drafting of the peace treaties is only a part of the entire agenda and procedure. The entire agenda and procedure should be decided by the five member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council. In other words, the Soviet Union has reason to refuse China's participation in the drafting of the peace treaty, but it has no reason to oppose China being one of the conveners of the peace conference.

Secondly, in terms of morality, Germany was the main culprit of World War II and should be held fully responsible for the outbreak of the war. Although China, due to geographical factors, was unable to directly participate in the war against Germany, it fought alone in the Far East, engaging in a desperate struggle with Germany's ally, Japanese imperialism. In fact, it shared a very significant burden for the Allied countries fighting on the European battlefield. The Allied victory over Germany and China's containment of Japan, preventing it from supporting Germany, made a significant contribution. In particular, the Soviet Union, during the war, strategically yearned for Japan's participation in the war against the Soviet Union, so as to achieve a pincer attack from both the east and west. Assuming that Japan, without China's constraint, had declared war on the Soviet Union without any scruples, what tragic situation would have resulted for the Soviet Union under the combined attack of the two major powers of Germany and Japan? We dare not imagine it. Now, the Soviet Union has forgotten the contributions of its former allies and actually opposes China being a convener of the peace conference with Germany. This is tantamount to insulting the international status of its former allies. What is the moral justification for this?

Based on the above two reasons, when the Chinese government was invited to attend the London Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting at the end of last month to express its views, it sent notes to the governments of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, reiterating its consistent position and proposing two suggestions: The peace treaties with Germany and Austria should be discussed at a formal peace conference held by the relevant countries of the United Nations; all procedural issues regarding the convening of the peace conference should be discussed and decided upon in advance by all five member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council. At the same time, it explained the reason: "According to the Potsdam Agreement, the drafting of peace treaties with European enemy countries is to be carried out by member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council that have signed the instrument of surrender, but the convening of the peace conference and all procedural issues related to the organization of the peace conference should be decided upon in advance by all five member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council." The reasons provided by the Chinese government can be described as reasonable and forceful, and there is really no way to refute them. When the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting discussed this issue on the 14th, the British and French representatives also advocated that after the drafting of the peace treaty with Germany is completed, a peace conference with Germany should be convened for discussion, and the four major powers and China should be the conveners of this peace conference. This also shows that people think alike. As long as the reasons are normal and sufficient, there is no need to fear the sophistry of others. The reasons given by the Soviet representative Gusev are still the same set of arguments that Molotov made at the New York Foreign Ministers' meeting, which are obviously unreasonable and do not need to be refuted.

Molotov and Gusev are both top-notch diplomats of the Soviet era. They are not only clear-headed and sharp-eyed, but also have a deep understanding of everything. Is it possible that they cannot distinguish such a simple matter? Why do they want to oppose China being one of the conveners of the peace conference? Why does Molotov dare to despise China to such an extent? These questions are worthy of our deep reflection and vigilance!

The foreign policy adopted by our country after the war can be considered enlightened enough. In any international conference, we have consistently adopted an impartial and detached attitude. When faced with irresolvable disputes, we often act as a mediator to resolve difficulties, and we have made countless efforts to promote international cooperation and understanding in the past year and a half. The success of previous international conferences has also benefited from the strength of the Chinese representatives. It can be said that China has fulfilled its role as a bridge between the two major international blocs. In particular, towards the Soviet Union, we have strived for its understanding and friendship. In order to gain the friendship of the Soviet Union, we have made great self-sacrifices. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance further proves China's sincerity towards the Soviet Union! But why does the Soviet Foreign Minister want to insult China's international status to such an extent? We really feel puzzled.

This is not the first time our country has been insulted by the Soviet Union internationally. For example, in July of last year, the Soviet Union refused China to be one of the conveners of the Paris Peace Conference. Although this also aroused resentment among the Chinese people at the time, in order to preserve the traditional friendship between China and the Soviet Union, we endured and endured, and finally managed to dilute it. At the same time, with the mediation of friendly countries such as Britain and the United States, we were able to take turns with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to serve as chairman in the Paris Peace Conference, so it did not cause a breakdown in the feelings between the two peoples. But today, the Soviet representative has relapsed into his old ways. Regardless of the Soviet Union's intentions, it will inevitably affect the friendly feelings that the 450 million Chinese people have had towards the Soviet Union for many years. For the sake of preserving the traditional friendship between China and the Soviet Union, we have to protest against Gusev's argument of disregarding the opposition of the British, American, and French representatives and insisting on his original position, even at the cost of insulting China's international status.

### Strictly Guard Against the Resurgence of German Aggression France and Czechoslovakia to Conclude Alliance Significance of this Move as Moscow Foreign Ministers' Meeting Approaches France and Poland Also to Conclude Cultural Agreement

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The French Foreign Ministry announced today that France is about to conclude alliances with Czechoslovakia and Poland. Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister Masaryk, who came to Paris to sign the treaty, had the opportunity to hold talks with the French Foreign Ministry and believed that since both governments are willing to assist in promoting European security and world recovery and prosperity, negotiations should be held immediately to implement the joint declaration of France and Czechoslovakia in August 1944. A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that the new Franco-Czech treaty will reaffirm the validity of the previous treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries. The spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry also said that French Foreign Minister Bidault and Polish Foreign Minister Modzelewski have held talks on the conclusion of a Franco-Polish cultural agreement. When reporters asked the spokesman whether the French government wanted to unite with the Soviet Union in order to take concerted action at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' meeting, the spokesman solemnly stated that France had no intention of forming an axis with any country. France has no intention of forming a group to force other countries to accept its opinions on the German issue.

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 14th] Regarding the upcoming negotiations between France and Czechoslovakia to conclude a treaty of alliance, French Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Dejean, commented that the simultaneous announcement by the governments of France and Czechoslovakia that they will hold negotiations to conclude a treaty of alliance is sufficient to show that both countries suffered during the war and fought for their own freedom and the freedom of the world. Now, they can still respect each other and have decided to eliminate the unfortunate page of 1939 in their history, and work together with the United Nations to develop peace and world prosperity. At the same time, Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister Masaryk issued a statement saying that the joint communique issued by the governments of France and Czechoslovakia was the result of his and Clementis's meetings with French leaders in Paris. France is Germany's western neighbor, and Czechoslovakia is Germany's eastern neighbor. Both sides will definitely express great concern over the negotiations on the German peace treaty. The political importance of the Franco-Czech joint communique lies in the fact that the German peace treaty must guarantee the control of Germany and the security of France and Czechoslovakia.

### Anglo-French Alliance Negotiations Begin British Side Seems Indifferent

[Reuters, London, 14th] Formal negotiations for an Anglo-French alliance began today. Both sides formally exchanged drafts. The French draft was approved by the French cabinet this morning and delivered to British representative Sir Harvey by French Ambassador Massigli at the British Foreign Office this afternoon. It is generally believed that due to the few differences of opinion in the drafts proposed by both sides, there should not be any difficulties during the negotiations. The French draft seems to want to expand the alliance relationship to the military field, including the joint use of bases, the exchange of aviation personnel and equipment, etc. The British side does not seem to want to use the Anglo-French alliance treaty to replace the functions of the United Nations organization. However, some British officials believe that concluding a military alliance with France at present can better guarantee peace in Europe than the United Nations organization.

[United Press, London, 15th] Britain and France exchanged draft alliance treaties today, but according to the Foreign Office, Britain seems indifferent to the treaty, at least in the part relating to Germany. The point of contention may be the Ruhr question. French political leaders asked the British side to give guarantees, and the British side believed that this was a request for the Ruhr coal mines. Britain wants to postpone the Ruhr question until after the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Meeting before reaching an agreement. In Paris, a French government spokesman said that it would not be surprising if the Anglo-French alliance treaty were signed before the Moscow meeting next month. However, neither the British nor the French side has published the text of the treaty.

### French Economic Difficulties Wave of Strikes Rages Premier Ramadier Says "State Affairs are Worrisome"

[United Press, Paris, 14th] Civil servants in Paris, including the police, went on strike for four hours today, causing everything to come to a standstill. Premier Ramadier announced to the National Assembly that "state affairs are worrisome, and even the French Republic is worrisome." Transportation and communications workers, postal workers, various union officials, and other civil servants held a large-scale demonstration this afternoon, passing through the streets near the Arc de Triomphe. The procession was a mile long. The police also left their posts to join the march. Typesetting and printing workers from 32 daily newspapers in Paris had already gone on strike, so the newspapers were unable to publish. The civil servants' strike is a demonstration to achieve the demand for a monthly salary increase of 7,500 francs. The government argues that those with higher salaries cannot be increased by the same amount. Automatic telephones in Paris have stopped working, subway trains and buses are also not running, and postal and telecommunications traffic has completely stopped.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] Civil servants went on strike, including uniformed traffic police, but political and trade union figures here believe that this trend may subside. After Premier Ramadier made a strong appeal to the National Assembly, civil servants will no longer hold symbolic strikes. It is reported that the Premier has now rejected the trade union's demand for wage increases and has clarified the government's determination to continue to implement the Blum cabinet's policy of suppressing prices. At the same time, the newspaper industry strike is still continuing, waiting for the decision of the Price and Wage Commission. However, the printing workers' union is not controlled by communist forces, so its strike has no political nature.

### Philippine Civil War Hope for Resolution

[United Press, Manila, 15th] Peasant Army leader Taruc sent a letter to Congressman Fonacier today, asking to have it read to Congress, demanding an immediate cessation of the suppression. Once the military police stop their offensive, the Peasant Army is prepared to disband. President Roxas immediately answered the press, saying that the peasant problem cannot be solved piecemeal, and the pacification plan will continue. If Taruc wants to talk, his safety can be guaranteed. Political observers believe that with this sudden expression from both sides, there is hope for a resolution of the Philippine civil war.

### President Drives Tram in Person, Crowd Cheers

[Agence France-Presse, Mexico City, 15th] Mexican President Alemán drove a tram on a tour, which was seen by the public, but this is not a daily occurrence, only once. The President wanted to understand the tram operation in the city, so he sat on the platform of the tram and drove for 500 yards, and the crowd cheered along the way.

### U.S. Secretary of State Admits World Situation is Critical Reports on Diplomacy Before Senate Committee Scheduled to Depart for Moscow at the Beginning of Next Month

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a meeting today. Afterwards, Committee Chairman Vandenberg announced that Secretary of State Marshall had made a statement to the Foreign Relations Committee on the situations in China, South America, Palestine, and Europe. The statement was quite exciting in some respects.

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Marshall said today at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the world is in an extremely critical situation. Marshall later told reporters that, in addition to revealing the previous statement, he had discussed most of the world's points of contention at the meeting, one of which was the Palestine issue. In addition, preparations for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Meeting were also discussed. According to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, the Secretary of State has indeed gained a lot of experience in his short time in office, and his report is very encouraging.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] Marshall announced at a press conference that he will travel to Moscow by plane between March 5th and 7th to attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The selection of his advisors has not yet been decided.

Occupation Expenses

As for the U.S. expenses in its occupied countries, I oppose reducing them. If the people of these countries are struggling on the brink of starvation, the U.S. will not be able to continue its current occupation work. Therefore, the State Department is directly concerned about the living conditions of the people in the countries occupied by the U.S. If we reduce expenses, it will likely affect the U.S.'s position internationally. Although the world situation is extremely critical, I am still optimistic about the future.

Korean Issue

It is reported that a Soviet officer sent a letter to workers in Seoul, urging them to unite and oppose the U.S. authorities in Korea. The State Department is currently waiting for official confirmation of this news.

Relations with Poland

As for the U.S. recalling its ambassador to Poland, Lane, this does not mean that the U.S. is severing diplomatic relations with Poland. As for whether Ambassador Lane will return to his post after consulting with State Department officials, I am not in a position to say here.

Palestine

Regarding British Foreign Secretary Bevin's decision to submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations organization for handling, I am also not in a position to comment here. I believe that the relevant parties are still holding talks in London.

Greek Political Situation

Regarding the Greek issue, it is hoped that the Greek people will unite and serve the country during any period when any party has an army. The U.S. government hopes that the recent expansion of the Greek cabinet's base will symbolize that Greece has put the past behind it in order to cope with the future. It is hoped that the Greek government can issue an amnesty decree and take steps to reform its administration.

### Soviet Union Intends to Reject Our Country's Inclusion as an Invited Country to the Peace Conference with Germany Britain, the United States, and France Reject Yugoslavia's Territorial Demands on Austria

[Central News Agency, London, 14th, United Press] The Soviet Union still insists that China should not be included as one of the invited countries to the proposed German peace conference. The Soviet side stated that only countries that "signed the German surrender terms" (i.e., the four powers) may be invited countries. The French representative broke the harmony of the meeting today by refusing to consider giving Germany an opportunity to state its opinions on the peace treaty.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th broadcast: The foreign deputies of the United States, Britain, and France, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet deputy, rejected Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th broadcast: The Australian government today sent a memorandum to the Four-Power Deputies' Meeting, suggesting that Germany be established into a design group similar to the Far Eastern Commission, with the participation of all belligerent countries against defeated Germany. The memorandum opposes the "rapid" establishment of a German central government because Germany has not yet shown that it can implement democracy.

### Wallace's View Believes U.S.-Soviet Relations are Easing

[National News Agency, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, 14th] This newspaper's Slovakian news correspondent in New York recently reported that former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace met with this newspaper's correspondent today and said that the current relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is not as tense as it was in the summer of last year. My previous letter to President Truman, in which I stated my views on diplomatic relations, was helpful in clarifying the situation at that time. Now, Marshal Marshall's assumption of the post of Secretary of State has greatly improved the current situation. Regarding the policy adopted by the U.S. in Germany, the U.S. envoys in Eastern European countries are now inclined to cooperate with reactionary elements. The tendency of the occupying authorities in Germany is the same. If the four powers do not change this attitude, then German industry may not be fully utilized. I advocate that the Ruhr region should be internationalized, and that other parts of Germany should be organized into free federations. I believe that isolationism has not yet disappeared.

### Vandenberg on U.S.-Soviet Relations ... The Soviet Union has not reciprocated the U.S.'s fairness and goodwill in diplomacy.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg gave a speech at the Michigan Chamber of Commerce today, stating that the Soviet Union has not reciprocated the U.S.'s fairness and goodwill in diplomacy. Vandenberg's statement refers to the Soviet Union's disregard for the U.S.'s request to resolve the Lend-Lease accounts.

Lend-Lease Accounts

Vandenberg also said that we are willing to wholeheartedly establish a relationship of mutual fairness and goodwill between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but we rarely fail to fulfill this obligation, while the Soviet Union does not. The value of the military equipment that the U.S. lent to the Soviet Union during the war was $11.3 billion, and we never hesitated because of its great value. But for a year, the Soviet Union has completely ignored the U.S.'s four proposals to settle the accounts. The State Department's note on the 125 merchant ships leased to the Soviet Union was also ignored by the Soviet Union. The above two are just the most obvious examples. I dare say that this kind of experience cannot promote mutual goodwill and understanding.

Desire for Peace

Vandenberg continued that the U.S. government insists that the Soviet Union quickly respond to the U.S. note, and this action cannot be regarded as an unfriendly act or a loss of dignity. The Soviet Union's desire for peace is no different from the U.S.'s desire for peace. The U.S. only seeks impartiality, and our price for peace is to deeply believe that peace under the protection of the United Nations will benefit both countries. We should wholeheartedly support the United Nations, but the U.S. must maintain complete and appropriate national defense before proving that it can maintain peace. We should sincerely cooperate with the Soviet Union to seek a universal disarmament agreement, and the Soviet Union should do the same with other countries. We cannot disarm alone, or rely solely on a piece of paper. Lessons from the past cannot be repeated.

Atomic Control

This theory also applies to the issue of atomic energy. Atomic energy itself is a threat to civilization. In the years that the U.S. has held the secret of atomic energy, we should seek an international plan to guarantee that atomic energy will never be used for destructive purposes in any place. We are currently making this effort, which is the greatest demonstration of international confidence and goodwill in the history of human relations. We will never give up the atomic secret until the day when the threat of atomic bombs can be eliminated from the entire earth, and ensure that any violator is promptly punished in some way.

Foreign Ministers' Meeting

The upcoming Moscow Foreign Ministers' Meeting may promote U.S.-Soviet understanding in all aspects. Regarding this point, I further hope that the Soviet Union will abide by its promise to allow U.S. newspapers to cover the news of the meeting without restriction and to provide various conveniences without restriction, which is the most convenient and wise.

### Su Jian Persists in Concluding a Convention, Urges the United States to Destroy Atomic Bombs, Gromyko Vigorously Criticizes the U.S. Proposal

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 14th] The Security Council held a meeting tonight, with Soviet representative Gromyko firmly advocating the conclusion of an international atomic energy convention and criticizing the plan proposed by former U.S. representative to the Atomic Energy Commission, Baruch. His remarks included that Baruch's plan, which stipulated the establishment of an atomic energy agency independent of the General Disarmament Commission, was undesirable. If the five permanent members of the Security Council were to relinquish their veto power over the Atomic Energy Control Commission, it would undermine the foundation of the United Nations. The Atomic Energy Commission has yet to reach a consensus on recommendations for the control of atomic energy. The Commission has failed to comply with the United Nations Charter and the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on the conclusion of an international atomic energy convention. The conclusion of an international atomic energy convention would facilitate the work of the United Nations. However, the United States insists on Baruch's plan, preventing the convention from being established. The conclusion of an international atomic energy convention does not interfere with the atomic energy control system. In essence, the United States is currently using the continued manufacture of atomic bombs as a means of exerting pressure on other countries.

[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] Soviet representative Gromyko today severely criticized the United States in the Security Council for continuing to manufacture weapons of mass destruction, and stated that atomic energy is still being exclusively used for the manufacture of weapons, which are fundamentally weapons of aggression. U.S. representative Austin referred to Gromyko's remarks as a "minority report" and said that he would reserve his comments until he had reviewed Gromyko's amendment. Gromyko stated that the revision of the U.S. proposal could proceed, but atomic bombs themselves must be destroyed before any control is truly established.

### Two Sisters in South Africa Transform into Men

[Agence France-Presse, Cape Town, South Africa, 15th] Two sisters here, aged seventeen and fifteen, have recently undergone surgery and have become two brothers. The two sisters initially regretted not being born as boys and were overjoyed that their dream had come true. The medical community here has shown great interest in this surgery.

### The Palestine Problem Cannot Be Resolved; Britain Decides to Submit It to United Nations Bodies

[United Press, London, 14th] Foreign Secretary Bevin admitted today that Britain's long-term efforts to get Jews and Arabs to accept a compromise have failed. Palestine has been a thorn in Britain's side since the time of General Allenby. Approximately 100,000 British troops will continue to be engaged in security and be governed by the current government until a decision is made by United Nations bodies. However, Britain is now eager to resolve this issue. According to a Foreign Office spokesperson, the British government may ask the Security Council to convene a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the situation in Palestine. Although Britain has drafted an independence plan for Burma and withdrawn troops stationed in Egypt, it has not yet clearly indicated whether it is willing to propose a permanent withdrawal from Palestine. Whether the British government will submit a special plan for resolving the Palestine problem to United Nations bodies, or simply hand over all proposed plans to United Nations bodies without attaching additional recommendations, will be announced in the House of Commons next Monday.

### The Crisis of the British Coal Shortage Seems to Have Taken a Turn for the Better

Attlee Declines to Accept Aid from the U.S.

[This Newspaper's Report] London, 15th Broadcast: Hundreds of thousands of British miners and railway workers today voluntarily declared their willingness to transport coal for power and gas plants on holidays. The British coal shortage has eased today, and military vehicles loaded with coal are arriving one after another in London and other central locations lacking coal.

[United Press, London, 14th] A government spokesperson announced tonight: Current signs indicate that Britain has overcome the coal shortage crisis and has begun to resume industrial production, but the number of unemployed is still increasing. Prime Minister Attlee today discussed with the nine-member emergency committee the date for the partial restoration of electricity supply. U.S. President Truman offered to provide coal on American ships to Britain, but Attlee politely declined. He replied to Truman that the European continent needs coal just as urgently as Britain, and we cannot divert coal intended for Europe to Britain. The number of unemployed people in Britain has exceeded five million.

### U.S. Congressional Joint Committee Passes Budget Cuts

Personal Income Tax Reduced by 20%

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The Senate and House Joint Budget Committee today, by a vote of 50 to 22, passed a motion to cut $6 billion from President Truman's proposed budget of $37.5 billion for the next fiscal year. At the same time, it also followed the proposal of Representative Norcen, chairman of the House Budget Committee, to reduce personal income tax by 20%.

### British Defense Budget

[United Press, London, 14th] Defense Minister Alexander released a white paper today estimating that the British armed forces will need 1,087,000 male and female soldiers in 1948, unless the international situation improves, subject to further consideration. At the end of last year, the number of troops totaled 1,427,000. Alexander estimates the total defense expenditure budget for the 1947-48 fiscal year at £899 million, subject to change due to changes in accounting methods.

### President Truman's Mother-in-Law Fractures Her Femur in a Fall

[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 15th Broadcast: President Truman's mother-in-law, who is 94 years old, accidentally fractured her femur yesterday. It is reported that Mrs. Truman had previously fractured her femur twice, once in 1941 and once in 1943, and both times she recovered. It is not yet known whether she will recover this time.

### Manipulating Gold Prices Added to Blacklist; Evidence Collection to Ensure Severe Punishment; Personnel Decisions Made for the Supervisory Team; Hundreds of Military Police and Police Officers Assigned to Conduct a Comprehensive Survey of Trading Venues Throughout the City

[This Newspaper's Report] It is reported that, regarding the cause of this surge in gold prices, the military and police authorities, with the assistance of an economic expert and renowned accountant, have been investigating the accounts of banks and gold firms for several days. Initial research has concluded that the Central Bank's cessation of covert sales was a significant factor contributing to speculation.

Manipulating Gold Prices Added to Blacklist; Evidence Collection to Ensure Severe Punishment; Personnel Decisions Made for the Supervisory Team; Hundreds of Military Police and Police Officers Assigned to Conduct a Comprehensive Survey of Trading Venues Throughout the City

[This Newspaper's Report] Several days before the establishment of the economic reconnaissance network, the Garrison Command had already begun investigating the gold surge case, and it has now reached a stage. It is reported that after February 1st, eight or nine out of ten of the gold sold by the Central Bank were purchased by unscrupulous merchants who manipulated gold prices and monopolized the market. The authorities have prepared a blacklist of unscrupulous merchants suspected of manipulating gold and are expected to take action starting today. Zheng Jiemin, Director of the Second Department of the Military Intelligence Bureau, was ordered by Chairman Chiang to come to Shanghai to join Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu in organizing an economic supervisory team and implementing emergency measures. Since yesterday, hundreds of military police and police officers have been assigned to conduct a comprehensive survey of trading venues throughout the city, including banks, gold firms, rice shops, and stock markets, and to investigate and monitor individuals suspected of manipulation, preparing to take action at any time when concrete evidence is obtained. At 2 PM yesterday, senior military and political officials gathered again at Zheng Jiemin's residence to discuss personnel decisions for the economic supervisory team. It was decided that Commander Xuan would concurrently serve as the head of the team, with five members: Fang Zhichao, Director of the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau; Tao Yishan, Director of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Command; Wang Xinheng, Counselor of the Municipal Government; Wu Guangyun, Commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police; and Ji Yuanpu of the China Textile Corporation, responsible for planning and directing. A secretariat was established, with Li Zheng as the Chief Secretary, and Jiang Songping, Xu Youzuo, Zhang Yamin, and Wang Zhongqing as Secretaries. As for the three groups established: (1) Gold and Currency Investigation Group, concurrently headed by Xu Youzuo; (2) Food Investigation Group, concurrently headed by Wang Zhongqing; (3) Yarn and Cloth Investigation Group, concurrently headed by Zhang Yamin.

During yesterday's meeting, the "Economic Reconnaissance Network" organization methods were discussed, and it was unanimously decided to formally establish it starting today. The reconnaissance methods will initially thoroughly investigate gold trading accounts after February 1st, and the second step will be to investigate the reasons for the disruption of the rice and silk market and thoroughly investigate the main reasons for the surge in yarn and cloth prices. Once verified, they will be brought to justice.

Emergency Measures Submitted to Chairman for Review

Commander Xuan received reporters from various newspapers at the Garrison Command yesterday and stated: "The organization and personnel of the economic supervisory team were decided in consultation with the relevant leaders at 2 PM today, and emergency measures were passed. These measures are scheduled to be handed over to the Adjutant's Office of this headquarters tonight and sent to Nanjing for the Chairman to review. The contents will not be made public until the Chairman approves them. However, the economic supervisory team will continue to conduct inspections of gold, currency, food, and cloth as usual." Xuan also stated: "Regarding the punishment of unscrupulous businesses or individuals, there are also explicit provisions in the emergency measures. Any illegal businesses or individuals who are found to have evidence will be publicly announced, and they will be tried by a military court and severely punished. Chairman Chiang ordered that the names of illegal shops or individuals who stirred up trouble and created price increases must be investigated. This team has already obtained a partial blacklist and is currently collecting evidence and conducting further investigations. Once verified, they will be severely punished without leniency." Xuan hopes that people in all circles will vigorously report any illegal businesses or individuals. If reporting by letter, it can be directly submitted to the Economic Supervisory Team within the Songhu Garrison Command. If reporting verbally, one can go to the Secretariat of the team at the Garrison Command to report. Today is Sunday, and tomorrow the various groups of this team will formally implement various inspections.

### Attending the Joint Meeting of the Social and Finance Committees to Discuss the Gold Surge and Commodity Prices; Summarizing Six Conclusions; Speaker Pan Goes to the Capital to Present Them to the Authorities

[This Newspaper's Report] The Social and Finance Committees of the Municipal Council held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by Deputy Speaker Xu, to discuss suppressing commodity prices and curbing the gold and currency frenzy. Speaker Pan rushed back from the capital to preside over the meeting and took the night train back to the capital to attend the National Defense Conference. The Speaker reported on the discussions regarding the gold and commodity price case in the capital and stated that the central government believes that the recent gold surge and soaring commodity prices in the city are major issues that require careful study. Therefore, although there are currently no specific indications, there will definitely be important measures taken.

Regarding gold, the Speaker specifically reported that Chairman Chiang had inquired about the types of institutions operating gold trading in Shanghai. Subsequently, Councilors Luo Qinghua and Xu Yongzuo provided opinions that the Speaker would convey to the central government. The joint meeting discussed for three hours, and finally, Luo Qinghua, Xu Yongzuo, and Yan E'sheng summarized and published the opinions of the Municipal Council on this case as follows (these opinions are also requested to be taken to the capital by Speaker Pan to contribute to the government authorities): (1) Although there are multiple reasons for the recent gold and currency surge, it is undeniable that there has been poor planning. Combined with the pushing and assistance of speculators and manipulators, it has become an unstoppable trend. Now that the central government has decided to investigate, it is hoped that it can be done vigorously and thoroughly, ensuring that no one is wrongly accused or let off, and focusing on the main points without causing undue harassment. (2) The central government should reconsider and carefully decide on the gold policy to avoid causing public anxiety due to rumors. At the same time, there should also be appropriate measures taken for U.S. dollars. (3) The soaring commodity prices are purely affected by the fluctuations of the gold and currency frenzy. There is no real reason for the price increases, which is further confirmed by the fact that commodity prices in other cities are lower than in Shanghai. Moreover, the purchasing power of citizens is weak, and interest rates are high. If prices are raised for hoarding and speculation, there will be adverse consequences. It is hoped that people in the business community will understand this point and not follow the trend blindly, causing trouble for themselves. It is also hoped that citizens will remain calm and not engage in competitive purchasing, so that after the storm passes, commodity prices will stabilize. (4) Controlling commodity prices is an urgent measure that is essential for the current situation. However, there must be thorough consideration and detailed planning in advance, supported by a strong and effective organization, in order to achieve results and avoid repeating past failures. (5) The rationing system should be endorsed in principle. However, it is hoped that the government can grasp sufficient materials so that there can be sufficient and timely rationing when implemented to meet the daily necessities of life. If it is decided to implement it in Beijing and Shanghai first, starting with civil servants, educators, and industrial workers, and then extending it to all citizens, it will surely stabilize public sentiment and enhance its effectiveness. (6) Controlling commodity prices and implementing rationing are methods of distributing materials, but the fundamental problem lies in increasing production and enriching materials. Therefore, promoting and assisting production enterprises is still a top priority. It is rumored that the recent surge in gold prices was caused by those who obtained production loans last year purchasing gold. This is not true. It is hoped that the government will still adhere to its original intention of assisting production enterprises, estimating the quantity and value of materials that factories can produce as the basis for issuing loans, so that production can be increased, the supply of materials will be sufficient, and commodity prices will naturally stabilize.

### Standard Prices for Gold and Rice Decided Yesterday

[This Newspaper's Report] It is reported that the goals of suppressing gold and commodity prices were decided in principle at the meeting at Zheng Jiemin's residence yesterday. The gold price must return to the 5 million yuan level per tael, and the rice price must return to below 80,000 yuan per dan. Other stocks, yarn, cloth, and daily necessities should shrink back in proportion to the decline in gold prices. If rice merchants hide rice or refuse to sell, their licenses will be revoked; if necessary, the government will sell directly. There is absolutely no shortage of rice in the city, and it is estimated that it can last until September of this year.

### Zheng Jiemin Goes to the Central Bank to Investigate Accounts

General Zheng Jiemin began a thorough investigation yesterday. Yesterday morning, he went to the Central Bank to investigate gold trading accounts after February 1st. Bureau Chief Lin Fengbao reported on the gold surge. Later, because Bei Zuyi was in the capital and had not yet returned to Shanghai, Lin was unable to fully disclose the details. Therefore, the thorough investigation work will have to wait until Bei returns to Shanghai. The General has now decided to stay in Shanghai and will not return to the capital for the time being within five days.

[Another Report] Yesterday, Administrative Chief Fang of the Police Bureau, Section Chief Xu, Inspection Chief Tao of the Garrison Command, and Team Leader Qi also personally checked the quantity of gold allocated and selected cadres to go to inspect account books to investigate the real names of those hoarding and manipulating.

[Another Report] Yesterday, the stock market saw another surge. The responsible authorities are closely monitoring the situation and will take effective measures.

### Peace Movement Responds in Various Places

After the declaration of the peace movement was published, various places have automatically responded, and it seems that it will become a nationwide movement.

The mayor ordered his arrest and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### 4th Drama Festival Held Celebration Meeting; Awarded Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Prizes; 20 People Win Prizes for Improving Peking Opera

[This Newspaper's Report] The celebration meeting for the 4th Drama Festival was held at the Golden Grand Theater yesterday morning at 10 AM, with more than 400 people in attendance. Chairman Xiong Foxi gave a speech, stating that the significance of the Drama Festival is self-criticism, self-examination, looking to the future, and uniting playwrights. We should accept the advantages of various forms of drama and create new art. Six speakers then gave speeches. Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, suggested: (1) Filming the beautiful movements of various dramas for everyone to appreciate and learn. (2) Next year's Drama Festival can hold a Southeast Drama Exhibition and extend the time for observation performances. Liang Yiming, representative of the Actors' Association, hopes that both the main actors and supporting actors of Peking Opera can fulfill their responsibilities. Dong Tianming of the Entertainment Association requested that all sectors support and promote local dramas and strive for the status of playwrights. Zhang Daofan elaborated on the history and significance of the Drama Festival and stated that drama is a comprehensive art and should seek mutual assistance, cooperation, mutual learning, and further development. Zhang also revealed that Chairman Chiang's criticism of Peking Opera is that cooperation is not good and supporting actors are too poor. Tian Han expressed his opinion: First, we must unite; second, we must be prepared; third, we must have courage.

The last speaker was Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee, who expressed two opinions: (1) The "Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Prizes" were donated by Peking Opera artists who performed at last year's Chairman's birthday celebration. It is hoped that other art departments, such as fine arts, sculpture, and music, can also hold "Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Prizes." (2) Various dramas are for the people. Peking Opera was originally performed in temples and squares for public entertainment. It only developed into a court drama during the Qing Dynasty, enjoyed by a few. Today's trend should still be for the public to enjoy and for the people to be entertained.

Pan Zinong then read the declaration, presenting six demands and appeals from playwrights. Pan Gongzhan then presided over the awarding of the "Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Prizes" for improving Peking Opera. In addition to 20 people, including Zhou Xinfang and Cheng Yanqiu, winning awards, Mei Lanfang also received a flag of "Lofty Character and Integrity" for upholding righteousness and maintaining his integrity, even though he did not participate in the improvement of Peking Opera performances. The commemorative meeting ended at 12 noon.

[Another Report] From 2 to 5 PM yesterday, the Municipal Experimental Drama School held a Drama Festival celebration reception. Zhang Daofan and Gu Yuxiu gave speeches, and a drama literature exhibition was held.

### Mayor Wu and Chief Fang's Statements: Refuting the "February 9th Incident Support Association's" Distorted Account

[Central News Agency] Since the incident at the Quangong Building, all sectors of this city have paid close attention. Mayor Wu has repeatedly stated that the instigators and murderers must be severely punished. However, yesterday, the Wenhui Bao published an article titled "The February 9th Incident Support Association Refutes the Statements of Wu Guozhen and Fang Zhi," which contains many inaccuracies and is filled with wanton slander, suggesting ulterior motives. After reading it, Mayor Wu not only ordered the association to correct it but also issued a statement to reporters, strongly refuting it. The key points of the statement are as follows: (1) The meeting notice only used the name "Committee for Loving National Goods and Resisting American Goods," mimeographed and distributed to various industry unions. Why did it not specify the address or the person in charge? Was this intentional ambiguity to prepare for fabricating an incident and shirking responsibility? (2) According to the laws or customs of various democratic countries, such as the Soviet Union, public gatherings must first be approved by the government. In countries like Britain and the United States, the police authorities must be notified. According to our country's laws, people's organizations must also register with the Social Affairs Bureau. Why did this association neither register according to the law nor notify the police局 when holding the meeting? Did the organizers of this association believe they were above the laws of any democratic country, or were they deliberately creating an incident and unwilling to let the police know in advance? (3) The meeting notice clearly stated, "In order to promote national goods and save the industrial and commercial crisis." It did not state, "In order to promote national goods and resist American goods." It was issued to various industry unions, inviting them to "attend and provide guidance." However, according to reports from attendees from various industry unions, only songs like "The American soldiers won't leave, we are not happy" were sung, which had nothing to do with "promoting national goods and saving the industrial and commercial crisis." Was the notice intentionally deceiving various industry unions to encourage them to participate, while the meeting deliberately strayed from the topic, attempting to hijack the venue and incite anti-American sentiment? (4) How was the presidium of the meeting elected? In principle, the agenda should have focused on promoting national goods and saving the industrial and commercial crisis. Why was the agenda not like that at the time? Since various industry unions were invited to participate, why was their consent not sought regarding the presidium and the agenda? Is this kind of method democratic? Was it a deliberate attempt by a few people to control the meeting? (5) The meeting was neither notified to the police nor conducted according to its stated purpose. Some of the attendees were obviously deceived into attending (this point has been stated to the city government by representatives of various industry unions). Therefore, the responsibility for the disturbance of order and the loss of life should legally and reasonably be borne by the convener and the organizer of the meeting. (6) The deceived representatives of various industry unions have already petitioned the city government to thoroughly investigate the instigators and murderers. Moreover, the innocent Liang Renda was tragically killed, and many others were injured. Should the government thoroughly investigate and pursue the matter? (7) Furthermore, the so-called "February 9th Incident Support Association" that published documents in the Wenhui Bao, according to the Wenhui Bao, did not specify the address or the person in charge. Are the organizers of this association again following the methods of the so-called "Committee for Loving National Goods and Resisting American Goods," deliberately confusing black and white, inciting discord, and attempting to create an incident again?

Chief Fang of the City Party Headquarters issued a statement, the full text of which is as follows: "After reading the article in the Wenhui Bao on the 15th, entitled 'The February 9th Incident Support Association Refutes the Statements of Mayor Wu and Myself,' I find the language evasive, full of戾氣, and intentionally煽动蛊惑. At a time when the Communist bandits are endangering the country, Shanghai is the center of the nation. The security of the nation depends on the authorities and the people making painstaking efforts to govern, while those who sow discord are attempting to increase social unrest to achieve their political ends. This kind of statement is not worth answering. However, the tragic death of Mr. Liang and the loss of a young man to the nation, adding a widow to society, is extremely painful. Who did this? Who caused this? Right and wrong are self-evident, and justice will prevail. Why use sophistry? The organization of the so-called 'February 9th Incident Support Association' has no legal entities participating, and it is unknown whether it is a political group in operation. If it is to sympathize with Mr. Liang and seek redress on his behalf, then this kind of organization must first respect the stance of the citizens and not be used for political struggles. Secondly, it must respect the dignity of the law and not mix subjective opinions. Today, as China moves towards democracy, people have freedom of assembly and association, and all political parties can operate openly, which is far from comparable to the blockade in the 'Liberated Areas' of the Communist Party. I would like to reiterate my opinion on this case as a response: (1) Freedom of assembly is a fundamental principle of democracy, and Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that it cannot be deprived by anyone or interfered with by any agency. Advocating for the national goods movement can be done through open gatherings. However, the venue was changed three times, and there was no presidium or chairman (as reported in the newspapers). What is the intention behind such mysterious democracy and freedom? (2) Article 55, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations on Violation of Police Regulations stipulates that gatherings must be notified to the police局. This has been the practice in this city for many years, as it is in European and American democratic countries. How could the participants of the meeting not know this? Now, instead of blaming the convener for not notifying the police, they blame the government for failing to fulfill its responsibilities. There is nothing more颠倒是非 than this. (3) Mr. Liang participated in the meeting to promote national goods and was injured and died in a brawl among the attendees. This must be heartbreaking for the convener of the meeting. However, who is this convener? Who is the instigator of this tragedy? And who is the murderer? The government has the responsibility to protect the people and should thoroughly investigate. The judiciary has the responsibility to protect human rights and should punish the murderers according to the law. (4) Since the Liang case has been transferred to the court, everything should be left to the court to handle. Those who speak of freedom must respect the law, and those who talk about democracy must respect discipline. Those who borrow freedom are not democratic, and those who undermine discipline are not what those who advocate democracy should do. The above are my candid views and sincere advice. I have said everything I need to say and will not respond further."

### Military Police and Gendarmerie Joint Inspection Brigade: Founding Ceremony Held Yesterday

Over 400 people attended, including the commanders and deputy commanders of each brigade, military police, and police officers. Commander Xuan personally attended and delivered a speech, explaining the significance of the establishment of the inspection brigade, which lies in unifying powers and responsibilities, avoiding duplication of work, strengthening security, and avoiding harassing law-abiding citizens. The targets of inspection should be limited to those related to security, such as suspected bandits and villains who disrupt social order. As for men and women sharing a room in hotels, unless there is a suspicion of affecting security, it is not within the scope of inspection. The demeanor of inspection should be polite, peaceful, and thorough. Before a crime is proven, they cannot be treated as criminals.

### Conspiracy to Murder Husband: Two Criminals Sentenced to Death; Nodded and Smiled Upon Seeing Each Other, Stunned Upon Hearing the Verdict

[This Newspaper] The case of Gu Chengcuiyun, a female worker at Xin Shen Textile Factory, and her lover, Xu Meifang, jointly plotting to murder Gu Yucai, the husband, has been concluded after a trial by the District Court. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the verdict was pronounced, sentencing the defendants Cheng Cuiyun and Xu Meifang to death and depriving them of their civil rights for life.

After Judge Wu Shaochang took the stand, he brought up the two defendants, the adulterer and adulteress. They nodded and smiled at each other in court, unaware that their end was near. They were stunned upon hearing the verdict. The court explained the reasons for the verdict, stating that the victim was lured to Shanghai by Cheng Cuiyun, and Cheng and Xu had committed adultery. Both points had been admitted by the defendants themselves. Gu Yucai was strangled to death before his death, which had been verified by the prosecutor, leaving no room for sophistry. Xu Meifang admitted to committing the crime but claimed that Cheng Cuiyun did not know about it beforehand, obviously intending to absolve Cheng of guilt. After repeated interrogation, it was clear that the two defendants had jointly premeditated the murder, so the judgment was made as above.

She claimed that the house was her private property and had nothing to do with Shao Shijun, requesting the seal to be lifted and returned. Yesterday's judgment: In accordance with Article 234 of the Civil Procedure Law, without oral argument, a preliminary ruling was made, dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit, and the plaintiff was to bear the costs of the litigation.

(1) Chen Peisheng wrote: "There is a resident of this neighborhood, Chen Shunfu, who is over seventy years old, with no relatives or friends and no one to support him. All his property before the war was destroyed by artillery fire. He now lives under broken walls and relies entirely on the assistance of his neighbors for survival. With prices soaring, he is extremely distressed and worried about the future. I am applying for relief on his behalf. Can you appropriately grant assistance?" (Approved 100,000 yuan)

(2) Chen Wei wrote: "My husband used to be a military officer and died of overwork in your hospital, leaving behind me and three children. I rely on washing clothes for a living, but the cost of living has risen so much that it is difficult to maintain. I am being forced by hunger and cold and can only wait to die. I am now presumptuously writing to apply for relief." (Approved 100,000 yuan)

(3) Huang Zihe wrote: "I am a teacher, 53 years old this year, with a son who is only eleven years old and a daughter who is fourteen years old, all of whom depend on me to survive. I have been unemployed due to illness since 1944, barely surviving and living in a state of sorrow. Recently, due to malnutrition, my illness has worsened, and the future is bleak.

### Education Loan Committee Accounting Independence

This term is presided over by Pan Gongzhan

This term is presided over by Pan Gongzhan. Currently, hundreds of students from the Academic Security Association went to the Education Bureau to petition, raising questions such as "Why is the Education Loan not being processed this term?", "Where did the remaining loan funds go?", and "Thoroughly investigate the entire loan account."

The most famous Oxford and Cambridge universities are of a higher standard than universities in other countries around the world. They adopt a tutorial system and are divided into more than 30 colleges. Students do not attend classes regularly. Tutors assign topics, and students study on their own, have a conversation once a week, submit a paper for each subject, and occasionally invite celebrities to give lectures, which students must attend. Each student must live on campus for at least two years. Management is strict, and drinking and dancing are prohibited. After graduation, continuing studies for four years will result in a master's degree. The British Library has 60,000 volumes of Chinese books, mostly rare copies of the historical records of the Qing Dynasty. The museum houses 3,000-year-old Chinese bronze tripods and three jade decorations from the Qing Dynasty.

There are currently 122 Chinese students in France, studying medicine, agriculture, law, art, physics, music, statistics, literature, business, philosophy, chemistry, geology, religion, mathematics, electrical engineering, civil engineering, aviation, electrical engineering, mining, and ethnology. Most are concentrated in Paris and Lyon, obtaining doctoral and other degrees. During the war, the Ministry of Education provided relief, at 2,500 francs per student. Currently, there are still 70 self-funded students receiving relief. New students at the Sino-French University in Lyon receive 750 francs per person, and currently 10 people are being subsidized. Old students receive 400 francs per person, and currently 20 people are being subsidized. This time, the children of overseas Chinese in France, who did not have instructors in the tutorial classes, were subsidized 6,000 francs per person. According to the instructions of the Ministry of Education, students who have studied abroad for four years or conducted research for two years should return to China to serve. The Ministry of Education has notified embassies abroad to provide free or subsidized assistance to encourage students to return to China. Students have three concerns: (1) They aspire to pursue further research and study; (2) They are in debt and find it difficult to leave; (3) They are isolated from the domestic situation and are afraid that they will not be able to find employment upon their return, so many are unwilling to return to China.

French university faculty must serve for two years after graduating from university before being allowed to take the exam. They are first assigned to teach in middle schools, and then promoted to assistant teachers and lecturers in smaller universities, gradually becoming professors in larger universities. Teachers' salaries range from 9,000 to 12,000 francs, with an additional one-third for married individuals and a salary increase for those with children. The highest salary for professors is 80,000 to 120,000 francs. 120 francs is equal to one U.S. dollar. The heads of each department are publicly elected by the professors' association. There are more than 20 universities in France, with Paris being first-class, Lyon and Bahrain being second-class, and Lansnow being third-class.

### Ministry of Education Plans to Hold Summer Overseas Chinese Teacher Training Courses Recruit 200 Students Divided into Middle School and Elementary School Groups

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] In the summer of the 34th year of the Republic, just after the end of the European War, when the Allied forces were fully engaged in the war against Japan and the recovery of Southeast Asia was imminent, the Ministry of Education, in order to cooperate with the victory and develop overseas Chinese education, specially held the first session of the Overseas Chinese Teacher Training Course in Qingmuguan, Chongqing, recruiting ambitious young people, giving them short-term training, and sending them to serve in overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools in Southeast Asia after the recovery of Southeast Asia. After the training was completed, just when China won the War of Resistance, most of the more than 80 graduates of the association were sent to work overseas last year, with excellent results. However, recently, overseas Chinese schools have been restored and new schools have been established one after another, and the need for teachers is even more urgent. Although there are the First and Second Overseas Chinese Normal Schools in China, there is currently no suitable institution to train overseas Chinese middle school teachers. In view of this, the Ministry of Education plans to hold the second session of the Overseas Chinese Teacher Training Course to continue to reserve teachers for overseas Chinese schools to meet the needs. It is reported that 200 students will be recruited this time, still divided into middle school teacher group and elementary school teacher group. In addition to public recruitment, various ministries and commissions of the central government and normal colleges can also recommend them. The training period is two months, and accommodation and expenses for handouts and writing materials are provided. After the training period is over, those who pass the examination will be issued certificates, and they can be introduced by the Ministry of Education to serve in overseas Chinese schools in various places overseas at any time. It is learned that the Ministry of Education plans to use the summer vacation to hold this kind of training course, so that teachers from various schools can participate, and a special commissioner has been designated to be responsible for the preparations.

### The Municipal Education Bureau Solicits Bids for School Desks and Chairs Wang Qichang Factory Refused to Bid Submits a Petition to the Municipal Council to Order an Investigation into the Truth

The Property Section of the Municipal Education Bureau has recently solicited bids for the manufacture of school desks and chairs, and there has been a situation of selfishness and unfairness that is inconsistent. The Municipal Council has received a petition from Wang Qichang Wood Factory and Shanghai School Equipment Company, requesting an investigation into the truth. The original petition from Wang Qichang Wood Factory stated: "This time, the Education Bureau is soliciting bids for the manufacture of 10,000 sets of school desks and chairs. The company believes that it is fully qualified to bid, so it prepared the procedures and paid a bid bond of 1 million legal tender to register. The Education Bureau also considered it qualified and allowed it to participate, as evidenced by the bid announcement and price list. Unexpectedly, when the company went to bid on time on February 12, it was blocked by Zhuo Chunji, who used his tricks to prevent the company from participating. The facts are unbearable. Now, the company will point out its selfishness, unfairness, and inconsistency: (1) There were originally 12 bidders, and 9 were qualified after review. The company was one of the reviewed parties. However, there was a sudden change when bidding, and only 4 were allowed to participate, deliberately allowing a small number of people to manipulate and make profits. (2) Zhuo Chunji's price for each set of school desks and chairs was 113,000 national currency, while the company's price was only 91,600 yuan and 100,650 yuan, as evidenced by the filled price list, which was rejected and kept sealed. The difference between the two is more than 20,000 yuan per set, totaling more than 200 million yuan. It is not difficult to see that he deliberately wasted huge amounts of public funds." According to the original petition from Shanghai School Equipment Company, "At that time, the supervisory officials insisted that the Social Bureau's business registration submitted by the company was a temporary receipt and could not be used as evidence, and refused to allow it to participate. Although the company stated its reasons, it was not adopted, and it was even said that if there was any injustice, you could file a lawsuit. It was found that there were 9 qualified bidders participating in the bidding that day. In an instant, only 4 were allowed to participate. Lu Fushun, who had always built a reputation, felt very dissatisfied and questioned him severely, and he was speechless, so he was allowed to participate. The result of the bidding was that Yang Heji won the bid with 100,400 yuan, and then it was changed to Zhuo Chunji to contract at 114,000 yuan. The company's original bid price was 95,000 yuan per set, which is more than 200 million yuan different from Zhuo Chunji's total bid price. At this time of national revival, funds are needed everywhere. It is incomprehensible to abandon the small and recognize the big and reverse the facts."

### Ministry of Education Asks the Delegation to Japan to Unify the Names of Overseas Chinese Schools in Japan All Named Chinese Elementary School or Middle School with the Name of the Place

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Our country's delegation to Japan reported that the Kobe Chinese Tongwen and other schools requested that the names of overseas Chinese schools in Japan should be unified. For this reason, it telegraphed to inquire the Ministry of Education. Recently, the Ministry of Education telegraphed back, stating that all overseas Chinese schools can be uniformly named Chinese Elementary School or Middle School, with the name of the place prefixed. If it is a junior high school or a girls' middle school, the words "Junior" or "Girls" should be marked above the words "Middle School."

Take on the Responsibility of Educating Taiwanese Compatriots

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Our delegation to Japan previously suggested to the Ministry of Education to organize a roving educational lecture tour to go to various parts of Japan to educate overseas Chinese, especially Taiwanese overseas Chinese, who have been isolated from the culture of the motherland for a long time and urgently need to be cultivated by the culture of the motherland. After repeated consideration, the Ministry of Education believes that the faculty of domestic universities is already in short supply and cannot send professors to Japan to take on this work. At the same time, our country's consulates in various parts of Japan have not yet been established, and the overseas Chinese groups have not been restored. It would be difficult to go there at this time, but there are many scholars and experts in the delegation to Japan who can take on this responsibility. The Ministry of Education has recently informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and transferred it to the delegation to Japan, asking the fourth group of the delegation to take on the responsibility of educating Taiwanese compatriots.

### New World of Basketball Teams – Columbus's Strength Is Formidable – Shan Team's Performance Was Wonderful Despite Losing

Last night's final basketball league game was originally between the Shan team and the Encas team. However, the Encas team requested a postponement due to unforeseen circumstances. The game was changed to a friendly match between the Shan team and the U.S. military Columbus team. The match was very exciting, and the fans continued to rave about it after the game.

The Columbus team is a U.S. Navy basketball team that recently arrived in Shanghai. Recently, the person in charge of the team accompanied the Navy and Marine Corps Youth Team to the Municipal Gymnasium to watch the game and planned to hold friendly matches with various Chinese teams. The person in charge of the team said: The team will stay in China for a month. Fans are lucky. The new world of salt ball teams, Columbus, has been discovered.

The Columbus basketball team is quite strong. Sixteen players took to the court last night, and there were still three players who did not play. Each player is tall and strong, combining the strengths of the Navy and Marine Corps Youth Team and the Giants team, being both lively and fierce. They are not as rough as the Navy and Marine Corps Youth Team, nor are they as slow as the Giants team.

Columbus's offensive tactics are to have two tall players, Ashe and Clowmey, stand under the enemy's basket, where they can reach the basket ring with their hands. Others can only stand by and watch. The Shan team's performance last night was also very wonderful. Lin Weiting's long-range shots were especially impressive. In a group of iron tower-like people, he made four clean shots in a row, which was really exhilarating.

The Shan team's loss yesterday was a glorious loss. Judging from Columbus's strength, there is no team in Shanghai that can match them today. The reason why the score difference last night was so small was that the foreign generals had a lot of opportunities to show their skills by frequently substituting players. However, they were still a little short, and Lin Weicong and others repeatedly scored more than a dozen points. The Columbus veterans saw that the situation was not good and put the old squad back on the court. However, it was too late, and they only won by a small margin.

The Columbus team's uniforms are light yellow with purple-red shorts. The squad consists of Ashe (20), Clowmey (13), Bosak (4), Bubber (21), and Burke (14). The positions are center, guard, left forward, left guard, and right forward. The key to scoring the most points is Bosak (4). (German)

### Gold, U.S. Dollars, and Grain Prices Stabilize After Recent Fluctuations – Government Bonds Suddenly Surge – From 3,800 Yuan to 7,500 Yuan

[Reported by this newspaper] The rise in government bonds was even more intense yesterday. With the court's ruling and the legislators' proposals, the rumors of repaying deposits at multiple times became louder. The Tongbing bonds opened at 4,000 yuan in the morning, and there was a scramble to buy them. Hot money sought an outlet, and the price was pushed up sharply. Room 360 and Room 552, among others, also entered the market. Although some large investors, such as Chen De in Room 550 and Room 604, took profits, they could not contain the buying frenzy. The price gradually rose to 7,500 yuan at the close, resulting in a doubling compared to the previous close. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu bonds also increased by more than double, with sharp increases of 2,500 to 3,700 yuan. The total transaction volume reached over 10 million yuan.

Also, the gold market has been quiet recently, and hot money has turned to attacking Chinese stocks and government bonds. Yesterday, under the competition of many parties, the price of government bonds soared again. According to related sources, the reasons are: First, yesterday's newspaper reported that the Legislative Yuan was dissatisfied with the one-to-one repayment of government bonds. Second, the deadline for supplementary payment of overdue bond tickets has been extended to the end of March this year. In addition, there are rumors in the market that the government will issue national construction gold bonds. It is observed that before issuing new bonds, the old bonds must be settled first to maintain creditworthiness. It is said that official capital purchased a large number of government bonds at the end of last year in order to try to demand that the government increase the repayment rate. Various rumors abound, and the price of Tongbing bonds finally soared in a sea of positive news.

### Increased Arrivals – Grain Prices Continue to Decline – Edible Oil Prices are Weak and People are Pessimistic

The grain market continued to decline yesterday. After the approved price was raised, vendors from all over the suburbs heard the news and transported grain to the city. The number of arrivals in the two markets increased sharply, with a total of 2,406.5 shi, three times more than the previous day. The South Market received 2,505 shi, and the North Market received 4901.5 shi. The sample platforms, which had been without goods for a long time, were widely seen in the market yesterday. Therefore, the supply increased, and rice shops were able to replenish their stocks as usual. In addition, the military and police authorities organized an economic reconnaissance network to secretly investigate rice worms that hoarded and manipulated grain prices. Therefore, speculators had no room for activity and were afraid of being punished. They were secretly selling their stocks quickly. The serious situation no longer exists. Transactions are gradually becoming more transparent, and the situation is returning to normal. Thick and thin rice and Xian rice all fell by about 5,000 yuan. The Yinbian yuan also fell by 10,000 yuan. However, high-end white粳 rice is still in short supply.

Flour has re-entered a state of fatigue. Because the factory-supplied flour has been sufficient for local sales recently, retail stores have become sluggish. Therefore, there are very few transactions. In the early market, there were many sellers. The Lilang foreign flour was lowered to 75,000 yuan, and the Jiu Tong flour was also lowered to 39,000 yuan, but there were no buyers. Therefore, the sellers gradually lowered their prices. The Lilang foreign flour opened low at 73,600 yuan, and the Jiu Tong flour also lowered to 38,000 yuan. The Shai Tong No. 2 flour was 46,000 yuan. The prices of various brands of flour were lowered by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There were a few transactions, but the market still showed a situation of supply exceeding demand. The Jiu Tong flour was 37,000 yuan, and the Shai Tong flour was 44,000 yuan. Due to the trickery of unscrupulous merchants, the transaction of bran was secretive. It was heard that the relief agency sent personnel to the market to inquire about prices. Only large bags of overnight goods were quoted at 31,500 yuan. The situation was unusually quiet. Although there were no transactions for large and small bags, the prices were 1,000 to 2,000 yuan firmer than the previous day. There was no transaction of wheat.

Edible oil: The market is sluggish. The initial market quotation was similar to the previous market. In the end, the actual sales were slow. In addition, the news from various grain stores was pessimistic, and people were pessimistic. The traders lowered their prices. Basket peanut oil opened at 245,000 yuan and fell to 240,000 yuan. Jiton peanut oil opened at 275,000 yuan and closed at noon at 270,000 yuan, a decrease of 10,000 yuan. There were still few inquiries in the afternoon. Soybean oil and Kunshan goods also lowered by 10,000 yuan, with the price at 290,000 yuan. Small car sesame oil also fell by 5,000 yuan. Factory clear oil was 240,000 yuan, with transactions.

Miscellaneous grains: Yellow beans are still actively sold in the street. It was previously reported that the arrival of goods from the Northeast would take some time. Therefore, Dalian and Tianjin goods rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and the market was firm. Picked green beans are rare and rose by several thousand yuan. Sesame seeds are in a stagnant state, and the price is stable. Nanyang merchants are interested in green beans and continued to add 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The distilleries are purchasing red beans and corn in the market, and the prices have risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Peanut kernels are sluggish, and the market price has fallen by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Bean cake was flat and then weak. Speculators disappeared, and the price was reduced by 500 yuan.

### Discussion on Oil Rationing – No Conclusion Reached

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai edible oil manufacturers Xie Yuxiang, Li Tinglian, Zhou Weibo, and Zhang Chao visited Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon to discuss the problems of edible oil rationing in the city and the supply of raw materials for oil extraction. However, no conclusion was reached. It is heard that they will meet again at 10:00 AM tomorrow to discuss how the China Trust Bureau can continuously supply cheap raw materials and maintain edible oil production.

Also, although the price of edible oil has fallen recently following the decline in gold and silver, the cost of production in the production area has increased. The Qingdao peanut oil has risen to 250,000 yuan per dan. If it is rationed at the limited price of 170,000 yuan, the loss will be too great. It is extremely difficult to resume rationing before a reasonable adjustment is made. In addition, Zhongzhi Factory rationed 700 dan of cottonseed oil yesterday (the 15th), still at the limited price of 155,000 yuan.

### Large Quantities of Foreign Rice and Cotton Shipped to Shanghai

[Reported by this newspaper] The "Newburg" ship, represented by the American Flett Shipping Company, loaded seven to eight thousand tons of foreign rice and cotton from Santos, South America, and is expected to arrive in port around the 20th of this month.

Miscellaneous Grains and Fertilizers Shipped to Guangdong

The China Merchants Bureau's Haiyue ship sailed from Shanghai to Guangzhou Bay and Xiamen the day before yesterday, carrying more than 370 bags of beans, 25,150 pieces of bean cake, and 2,000 bags of flour to Xiamen. 1,550 bags of peanut kernels and 88 pieces of peanut oil were shipped to Guangdong. Also, the Haihu ship sailed to Guangdong the day before yesterday, carrying 1,000 pieces of cotton yarn, 1,200 bags of peanut kernels, and 230 pieces of tea oil.

### Sugar Prices Fall Sharply

Yesterday, the sugar market fell sharply with the sharp fall in gold prices. The public association's spot goods, including medium sugar white and raw sugar red, fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Four cow-carriage white fell by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Three and a half army white fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Peruvian fine sand fell by about 20,000 yuan. The 24 coarse white stack order was only 194,000 to 7,000 yuan. It was found that the bid price of the Taiwan Company was 190,000 yuan, and the profit was also limited. The crazy period of the sugar market has passed, and it is gradually entering a normal state. The price of numbered goods also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The price of Tikao was 130,000 yuan, and the price of Shunde Qing was 125,000 yuan. A total of hundreds of packages were traded. However, it is heard that the production price has soared with the Shanghai market, but after this setback, it will inevitably form a upside-down situation.

### Tea Market is Firm Amidst Quiet

Yesterday's tea market maintained a firm tone amidst the quiet. The sellers continued to have the intention of hoarding and selling at higher prices. Although the buying interest from all parties was still increasing, it was difficult to get what they wanted. Although transactions were not optimistic, the selling price was unusually firm. Recently, the Suzhou merchants have a great demand for jasmine tea and are currently planning to ask tea merchants in this city for tea samples for selection and purchase. It is also reported that Wang Yutai Tea Shop is also interested in the 34-year-old Keemun red tea. It is currently actively negotiating with the Anhui Tea Company. It is heard that the price difference is not far, and it is expected that a transaction will be reached within days.

### Paper Quota Allocation Not Yet Decided – Newspaper Orders Approved First – Quantity Included in This Year's Quota

The quota allocation for paper is still being carefully reviewed by the Import Management Committee. Because there are many types of paper, the uses must be investigated in detail. Therefore, the qualifications of paper importers have not yet been approved, and the quota allocation cannot be started. It is learned that the committee is speeding up the process and will be able to resolve everything within this month. In order to facilitate the needs of the news industry, the committee has given priority to approving the import of newsprint ordered by newspapers before the end of December last year. The quantity approved for this item will be included in this year's quota. According to the person in charge of the Import Management Committee, the purpose of including paper in the quota this time is to save foreign exchange. In the future, the import of paper will be determined based on the national needs.

### Jewelry Stores are Quiet – Refuse to Accept Miscellaneous Brands

Although the Central Bank sold gold as usual yesterday, very few jewelry stores applied because gold shops were virtually closed. The number was only fifteen bars. The jewelry industry opened and operated as usual yesterday, with the listed price being 660,000 yuan, and the purchase limit was canceled. They supplied as much as possible. However, there were very few people buying gold jewelry, and they refused to accept the exchange of gold jewelry from brands other than their own. Before the authorities announced the entire financial stabilization plan, all jewelry stores were unwilling to take risks and suffer losses. They all took a wait-and-see attitude to wait for the opportunity.

### Cotton Cloth Market Becomes Weak

The cotton cloth market was weak because Fangjian Company's fine cloth sales on Friday were all purchased according to the order. This caused the market to be flooded with spot goods, and the dyeing factories became sluggish. Yesterday, the blue chicken white cloth was sold as usual, with the price being 145,000 yuan. People were unanimously pessimistic. The price of fine cloth in each stall fell sharply by 10,000 to 15,000 yuan. The price of jumping carp bleached cloth fell by 20,000 yuan. The price of dark-colored Shilin Meiting also saw a small decrease of about 10,000 yuan.

### Gold and Silver are Calm

Although the central bank did not allocate much gold yesterday, people were still calm. The price rose slightly after falling. It opened in the morning at 5.9 million to 6.1 million. There were still some settlements. The price fell to 5.8 million. Then there were actual sales to maintain the price, and it gradually stabilized. After ten o'clock, the central bank allocated 15 bars at a price of 6.3 million. After that, the high price reached 6.6 million. Near noon, it fell back to 6.2 million. At noon, it hovered between 6.3 million and 6.4 million. In the afternoon, there was not much activity because it was Saturday. The asking price was around 6.3 million. The result was a slight increase compared to the previous close. The price of gold jewelry was 660,000 yuan. The price of silver dollars fell slightly again. The secret loan interest rate was relaxed. The secret interest rate was only about 15%.

Foreign exchange was very calm yesterday. The U.S. dollar hovered between 12,000 and 13,000 in the sunny market. There was no special change from morning to noon. There was no change in the afternoon because it was Saturday. The result was no honor or disgrace compared to the previous close. The price of Hong Kong dollar was slightly lower. The price of Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams rose to 40 yuan. The result continued to decline by 200 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 2,650 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 3,250 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 42,400 yuan. Except for the Hong Kong exchange rate, there were not many transactions.

### Central Bank to Discuss the Issue of Silk Merchants Returning Spring Loans

Since the government announced the purchase of autumn silk, which was mainly organized by the Central Trust Bureau, the factories have successively delivered their silk. As of the 4th of this month, the total amount reached 1,187 dan, including 62 dan of autumn silk and 325 dan of zero-baked cocoon silk. It is estimated that the total amount of autumn silk, including zero-baked cocoons, is about 2,800 dan. The amount purchased by the Central Trust Bureau only accounts for one-quarter. As for the reasons for the manufacturers' delay in delivery, it is known that according to the regulations of the Central Bank, those who have not cleared their spring cocoon loans must send the spring silk they have spun to the Central Trust Bureau for purchase at 3.8 million yuan per dan. Only after the spring loans have been cleared can autumn silk be purchased. Manufacturers refuse to accept the return of spring loans in cash.

Manufacturers' Opinions: According to manufacturers' opinions as follows: (1) Those who collect more cocoons will inevitably extend the spinning period. If the raw silk is spun before August and September of last year and purchased at 3.8 million yuan per dan, the loss will not be too great. If the raw silk is spun later, the cost per dan has reached 4.5 million to 5 million yuan due to the sharp increase in spinning labor costs along with the rise in prices and the burden of interest. If the current silk price is lower than 3.8 million yuan, the manufacturers have no choice but to painfully send the silk for purchase. In order to avoid troubling the government, they will no longer ask for a price increase. The current market price exceeds 3.8 million yuan. In order to reduce losses, manufacturers cannot give up the opportunity. (2) Manufacturers with weak financial resources cannot pay the 30% down payment for spring cocoon loans, insurance, and prepaid interest. They have poor capital turnover and are exploited by high-interest loans. Spring silk suffers huge losses and cannot stop production. They are forced to pawn or sell the spun silk. If they must send the spring silk for purchase at 3.8 million yuan to repay the spring loans, it is impossible. It is also learned that the Central Bank has paid close attention to this issue and has scheduled a meeting at 3:00 PM tomorrow to convene the heads of the silk reeling industry association in the third district and the spring cocoon loan office to discuss the matter. It is expected that it will not be difficult to find a reasonable solution.

### Nuclear Allocation Committee Discusses Cotton Stocks of Private Yarn Factories

In addition to approving the purchase of cotton for various state-owned yarn factories and a few private yarn factories according to emergency applications last month, the Foreign Cotton Nuclear Allocation Committee did not complete the nuclear allocation for most private yarn factories until yesterday because the declaration of cotton stocks and the calculation of forms had been completed. Therefore, the committee will convene a meeting today to discuss the cotton stocks of various private yarn factories and the nuclear allocation of cotton purchases. According to the person in charge of the committee yesterday, most of the cotton stocks of various private yarn factories can maintain production for at least two months. Although a few factories are running out of cotton, the number is very small. The review standard for this audit is also based on the principle of leniency. The committee calculates the number of days each factory is open per month (26 days) and the existing number of spindles. The spindles that have been shut down due to power outages and some damaged spindles have not been deducted.

### Yarn Market Turns Firm from Weak as Peers Take Advantage of Low Prices

The yarn market was weak at first and then firm yesterday. In the early morning, it was heard that the gold market had been virtually suspended, and the holders were temporarily panicked and sold their goods at lower prices. The price of Twin Horse brand fell to the 4 million yuan mark, and the price of Red Kui Xing brand fell to 3.1 million yuan. Then, peers took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the price gradually rose again. At the close, the former reached 4.4 million yuan, and the latter rose to 3.35 million yuan. The results were a mixture of honor and disgrace, and were roughly the same as the market price the day before.

### Cotton Yarn Quality is Poor – Textile Management's Purchase is Difficult

[Reported by this newspaper] The Textile Management Committee has been purchasing cotton yarn, and more than a dozen yarn factories have submitted their stack orders. According to the person in charge of the committee, the committee found that the F and G grade standards of the yarn samples from each factory were unqualified. In order to take into account the practical difficulties, the committee may cancel this grade in the future. Also, most of the yarn samples from each yarn factory are rated as E grade, and very few are rated as A grade. According to regulations, the purchase price of E-grade cotton yarn must be deducted by 10%. Therefore, the committee hopes that each yarn factory should strive to improve the quality of cotton yarn.

### New Buying Continues, Chinese Stocks' Rising Momentum Remains Strong

Yesterday, Chinese stocks, held by strong hands, were not released. New buying continued to pour in, and short sellers suffered another defeat. The rising momentum remained strong. At the opening in the morning, current delivery stocks still saw continued lows. When deferred delivery entered the market, there was a sudden rebound. After the opening, buying became competitive. Numbers 7, 8, 224, 152, 145, 232, 181, and 188 all entered the market. Market participants fiercely pushed up prices, causing them to rise rapidly. China General Edison first reached its daily limit. Deferred Evergreen Silk rose to 1675 yuan. Numbers 105, 91, 155, and 133 sold off and retreated to 1610 yuan. Number 224 exited and immediately re-entered. Numbers 85 and 22 came in, rising to 1660 yuan. Numbers 177, 145, 224, 204, and 186 were still selling, and it fell to 1610 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, there was a major fluctuation, hovering between 1610 yuan and 1640 yuan. Later, numbers 4, 85, 155, 14, 181, 151, 112, 84, 97, and 57 all entered the market. At 11:30, the buying momentum surged, and market participants pushed up prices without end, causing it to rebound to 1715 yuan. Numbers 188, 184, and 181 sold off rapidly at high prices, retreating to 1670 yuan. Numbers 97, 4, 57, and 17 were still coming in. Numbers 125, 129, 198, 106, 145, 188, 12, and 156 were selling. At noon, it fell from above 1700 yuan, struggling again to around 1670 yuan. There was a large crowd of longs. Off-market interest was as high as two jiao, five fen, and a half, and even three jiao. As a result, compared to the previous close, Evergreen Silk and King Fu rose by 10%, China General Edison reached its daily limit, and Sino-British, American Asia, New Light, and Diligence Industries each rose by a strong 5%. In deferred delivery, Evergreen Silk rose by 10%, China General Edison reached its daily limit, and American Asia, New Light, and Sino-British each rose by a strong 5%. Cold stocks such as Commercial Press and Match Factory rose by a strong 5%. Underwear and National Goods slightly decreased, Cement rose by 15%, and the rest rose slightly. Among the various off-market stocks, except for China and World, which remained stable, the rest each rose slightly or by 10%.

Foreign stocks also rebounded yesterday, and the various stocks were extremely stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, Steel Industry, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Broad Industries, Paper Industry, Jardine Brewery, and Navigation Industry all saw slight increases, and Jardine Silk rose by 5%.

### General Administration of Banks to Purchase Industrial and Mining Materials from the United States

In order to assist factories and shops throughout the country that have been destroyed by the war and to develop domestic industry, the General Administration of Banks has recently negotiated with the United States to order a large quantity of industrial and mining equipment, water and power plant equipment, and building materials such as cement, bricks, and lumber. It is now known that the Industry and Mining Committee of the Administration has decided to openly distribute these materials to merchants and civilians in need. Any public enterprises or industrial and commercial companies established with the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs that have suffered losses in the war and are unable to develop their businesses may apply to local branches or the four banks, including the Central Bank, China Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, as well as the Central Trust Bureau and Postal Savings Bureau. The materials ordered are divided into two types: spot goods and futures. Spot goods are paid for and taken in US dollars, and the legal tender can be converted at the official rate of the Central Bank. Futures are paid in three installments, and the receiving bank recognizes statutory interest (7 li per month), which will be calculated together when the goods are delivered.

### Tung Oil Prices Reported to Rise in Producing Areas, Coconut Oil Plummets Sharply

The market price of tung oil has risen by another 20,000 yuan per dan. Producing areas have repeatedly reported rising prices. In particular, the tung oil in Hunan and Hubei is the strongest in the country. There is no longer any exportable amount of tung oil of sufficient quality in the Shanghai market. Traders are only using it for domestic sales. According to people in the industry, with tung oil prices rising in producing areas, it will be difficult for the Shanghai market to stabilize. Yesterday, the market for coconut oil plunged sharply. The price was 500,000 yuan per dan. Many retail investors sold off. As for asphalt, due to limited arrivals and undiminished actual sales, the price remained at its original level. Although the market price of butter increased to 480,000 yuan per dan, there were not many transactions. Retail transactions were mostly at 450,000 to 460,000 yuan per dan for the best quality.

### China Textile Construction Opens Sales of Cotton Cloth

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual, a total of 10,570 pieces. There were 14 applicant factories, each with a maximum application of 600 pieces. There were 86 numbered companies, each with one package, totaling 40 pieces. Among the allocated cloth pieces, there were 8,960 pieces of fine cloth and 1,610 pieces of colored cloth.

### High Prices of Yarn in South China, Many Applications for Transporting Yarn to the South

The fourth period for transporting yarn and cloth to South China is scheduled to end on the 25th of this month. In previous periods, the number of applications for yarn was higher than for cloth. There are even more applicants this period. According to general speculation, the price of yarn in South China is higher than in this city, so merchants are competing to transport it there for sale. In order to limit the large-scale export of this yarn and cloth, the shipping authorities are still strictly handling the review process according to regulations.

### Beijing's Food Administration Formulates Five Measures

According to Nanjing News Agency, food prices in Beijing are rising. The municipal government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to formulate measures for food businesses to apply for food allocation. The contents are as follows: (1) Grain merchants should fill out an application form based on their usual business conditions, and the industry association should verify the daily quantity required, then report it to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, pay the designated bank, and pick up the grain from the designated warehouse. (2) The profit from selling allocated food, in addition to the purchase price plus transportation costs, should not exceed 6% for rice and should not exceed 5% for flour. Prices should be marked uniformly for sale. (3) The quantity and price of food supplied shall be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau in consultation with the food authorities. (4) Grain merchants should register the names and addresses of customers who purchase more than five dou of rice or one bag of flour in detail for inspection purposes. (5) The rice or flour allocated to grain merchants should be sold immediately after purchase and should not be hoarded or resold. The above regulations have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and filed with the Ministry of Food. Violations of items (3), (4), and (5) will be punished in accordance with the regulations on punishing violations of food management during the emergency period.

### Allocation of Rayon Yarn, Strictly Prohibiting Hoarding or Resale

It is rumored that the rayon yarn allocated by the Central Trust Bureau to silk yarn businesses has flowed into the black market and is not being used for production. However, this has not been detected so far. The Silk Weaving Industry Association reiterated its previous order that any business that hoards or resells allocated rayon yarn will have its allocation permanently suspended, the goods will be recovered, and the matter will be reported to the competent authority for severe punishment.

### Carbon Arc and Live Livestock Approved for Import, Supplement to the Transport Management Commission's Public Announcement

Yesterday, the Transport Management Commission issued Public Announcement No. 8, correcting two items that were omitted from the classification table.

Regarding this application, the Central Bank has approved its reclassification into Appendix (3.A). (2) Live livestock belonging to mixed and improved breeds, as well as those needed for extracting raw dairy products, originally listed in Appendix (3.B), are now also reclassified into Appendix (3.A), and are approved for import.

### Inside Story of Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty Negotiations Over the Past Six Months

— Manila, 4th Dispatch from Our Correspondent in the Philippines, Lin Shen

While enjoying the benefits of the "Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty," the overseas Chinese in the Philippines will certainly immediately recall the planter of this treaty, former Philippine Consul-General Dr. Duan Maolan.

The Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty was initiated after the liberation of the Philippines. Shortly after taking office, Dr. Duan, recognizing the rampant anti-Chinese sentiment, felt that it was imperative to establish a treaty between the two countries as a permanent solution to provide a basis for action. Furthermore, with the Philippines having declared independence, a treaty between China and the Philippines was even more necessary for the survival and protection of the overseas Chinese.

The Planter, Dr. Duan Maolan

In November 1945, Dr. Duan discussed the matter with Mr. McNutt, the highest American commissioner in the Philippines. At that time, the Philippines had not yet become independent, and diplomatic affairs were still handled within the U.S. High Commissioner's Office. Mr. McNutt immediately agreed to assist and suggested to Dr. Duan that he formally discuss the matter with then-Philippine President Osmeña. Dr. Duan then requested instructions from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, as our ministry was returning to Nanjing, there was no response for a long time.

In March 1946, the Ministry telegraphed Dr. Duan to tentatively discuss the matter of signing a treaty with the Philippines. Dr. Duan followed the order and immediately obtained the support of former Philippine President Osmeña and the Foreign Affairs Committee, which was jointly established by the U.S. and Philippine authorities at the time. However, as President Osmeña and current President Roxas were in the midst of a heated election campaign, the treaty matter was temporarily put on hold again. It was not until the Philippines became independent and current President Roxas took office.

In June 1946, our consulate finally received the full text of the treaty from our Ministry via telegram, instructing Dr. Duan to study it and consider submitting it to the soon-to-be-officially-independent Philippine government. After careful study, Dr. Duan submitted the entire draft to Philippine President Roxas. Shortly thereafter, the Philippines became independent, and the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established. Our government sent Special Envoy Gan Naiguang and Treaty Division Chief Wang Huacheng to the Philippines to attend the ceremony and planned to take the opportunity to discuss the treaty with the Philippines. However, due to Mr. Gan's short stay in the Philippines, no concrete achievements were made. Therefore, Dr. Duan continued to handle the matter. Subsequently, Dr. Duan held several consultations and discussions with Philippine Foreign Minister and Vice President Quirino. In August of the same year, the Philippine side first decided to propose amendments. The amendments to our treaty draft were as follows:

Philippine's First Proposed Amendments

(A) The following were required to be added by the Philippine side:

(1) The contracting country is a sovereign nation and has the right to promulgate any law. The residents of the other contracting country have the obligation to abide by it. (Note: If this item is recognized, if the Philippine government promulgates a law in the future stating that overseas Chinese may not engage in retail or wholesale trade, our overseas Chinese will also have the obligation to comply. This is clearly stipulated in the friendship treaty.)

(2) The two contracting countries shall not use force to resolve disputes but shall resolve them through mediation or arbitration.

(3) The nationals of the contracting countries shall not participate in political activities in the other contracting country.

(4) The contracting country may conscript nationals of the other contracting country into military service during wartime.

(5) China shall not enjoy the special privileges granted by the Republic of the Philippines to the United States.

(B) The Philippine side requested the cancellation of the following points:

(1) The security guarantee of the persons and property of the nationals of the contracting countries in the other contracting country.

(2) National treatment regarding judicial matters and tax obligations.

(3) Cancellation of the most-favored-nation treatment for entry and exit, travel, and residence, and compliance with the laws of the contracting country.

(4) Cancellation of the most-favored-nation treatment regarding schools, churches, cemeteries, etc., and the acquisition of inheritance, transfer, and disposal of movable and immovable property.

Our Side Proposes Amendments

The first and second items to be cancelled by the Philippine side as mentioned above were negotiated by Dr. Duan and Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino on the same day. The Philippine side agreed to add them at his request. Dr. Duan immediately returned to Beijing for instructions. Three weeks later, he returned to Manila and presented our side's amendments to the Philippine side. The amendments included the following points:

(1) The fact that a country has the sovereignty to promulgate laws and that the two contracting countries shall not use force to resolve disputes is recognized internationally. There are now also provisions of the United Nations Organization. This point does not need to be stated in the treaty.

(2) Regarding the previously proposed "most-favored-nation treatment," our country adopts the principle of equal treatment for the people of all countries. In order to avoid discrimination, it should be added to the text without any other intention.

(3) It is obvious that the nationals of the contracting countries shall not participate in political activities in the other contracting country. It seems unnecessary to include it.

(4) If one of the contracting countries participates in a war that is prohibited by the United Nations Organization, it would violate the intent of the United Nations if the nationals of the other contracting country had the obligation to serve in the military. Therefore, the treaty should not include it. Furthermore, friendship treaties usually do not involve conscription.

(5) China recognizes that the special privileges of the United States in the Philippines cannot be enjoyed equally, but the wording of the original article should be modified.

The Philippine side did not respond to the above amendments for a long time. Later, Minister Chen Zhi-ping arrived from the United States and the embassy was established. As of October 5, 1946, there was still no response. As Dr. Duan was about to return home to take up his new position, he paid another visit to the Philippine Foreign Minister to discuss the content of the amendments in detail. Three days later, the Philippine Foreign Minister sent the reply to the embassy. The content, in addition to deleting the stipulation that the nationals of the contracting countries shall not participate in the political activities of the other country, still disagreed with several of our proposed amendments. Subsequently, Dr. Duan was ordered to go to London to take up his new position and brought the Philippine counterpart back to the Ministry for consideration. Soon, the Ministry instructed the embassy to continue consultations according to the previous intention.

Conclusions of Further Consultations

On October 27, Minister Chen Zhi-ping and Philippine Foreign Minister and Vice President Quirino discussed in detail and reached the following four conclusions:

(1) The Philippine government agreed to cancel the stipulation that the contracting country has the right to promulgate any law and the nationals of the other contracting country have the obligation to comply with it. (Note: The rights and interests of Filipinos in our country are few, while our rights and interests in the Philippines are many. If the Philippines promulgates a law that is unfavorable to our nationals, we can also promulgate a law that is equally unfavorable to Filipino nationals to resist it. This will have no practical impact on the Philippines.)

(2) The Philippines agreed to add the most-favored-nation treatment item.

(3) The Philippine side insisted on not giving up the conscription item. (Note: There are only a few hundred Filipino residents in our country, mostly music teachers, while there are more than 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines.) The next day, Minister Chen Zhi-ping met with the Philippine Foreign Minister again to discuss the conscription issue, wanting to change the word "conscription" to "volunteer soldier," arguing for as long as three hours. As a result, the Philippine side still could not seek instructions and stayed in Beijing for 40 consecutive days. On December 10, he returned to Manila and paid a visit to the Philippine Foreign Minister the next day. After detailed discussions, the following results were finally achieved with great difficulty:

(1) The Philippine side agreed to cancel conscription.

(2) Regarding the special privileges of the United States in the Philippines, our side recognizes that we cannot enjoy them equally, but we request that if the Philippine side grants these privileges to any third country other than the United States, China shall enjoy them equally.

(3) Our side accepts "cannot use force to resolve disputes" and adds the use of diplomatic means of mediation or arbitration to resolve them.

A Little Twist Before Signing the Treaty

From this point of view, the opinions of both sides were generally consistent at this time, so both sides were preparing to sign the treaty. However, the Philippine side's final draft was delayed. It was not until January 10 of this year that it was known that there was a twist behind the Philippine side's failure to submit the final draft. On that day, three points of change were proposed:

(1) If China wants to enjoy the privileges granted by the Philippines to a third country other than the United States, the conditions must be the same as those of that third country. (Meaning that if the British obtain mining rights in the Philippines, it is conditional on allowing Filipinos to fish in British territorial waters, then China must also allow Filipinos to fish in Chinese waters if it wants to enjoy mining rights in the Philippines.)

(2) If China grants privileges to any third country, the Philippines may also enjoy them under the same conditions. (Meaning that if China grants aviation rights to the United States, Filipinos can also enjoy them.)

(3) If one party to this treaty wants to terminate it, it should notify the other party one year in advance.

Our Ministry Expresses Two Opinions

After receiving these three changes, the embassy telegraphed the Ministry for instructions. The Ministry then instructed the embassy to express the following two opinions to the Philippine side:

(1) China treats all countries equally and does not grant any privileges to any country. Therefore, the Philippine side's last request does not need to be added.

(2) If the termination of the treaty is stipulated in this way, the effective period may be one year. If it is insisted that this provision be added, a fixed effective period of ten or twenty years must be added.

The negotiations for the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty had been going on for half a year since Dr. Duan submitted the draft to President Roxas. Both sides had agreed on the main points. The remaining issues were only minor issues and textual modifications. Therefore, Minister Chen met with the Philippine Foreign Minister on January 29 of this year and then established a "four-person ad hoc committee." The Philippine side consisted of Foreign Deputy Africa and legal expert Madamba, and our side consisted of Embassy Secretary Sun and Xue Yuqi to conduct a final detailed study of the text of the entire treaty and minor details, and to determine a form acceptable to both parties for the plenipotentiaries of the two countries to sign. The negotiation process of the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty over the past six months has been as described above, and the main points of the treaty are also as described above.

Those who represented our country in the negotiations for the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty this time were former Consul-General Dr. Duan Maolan and Secretary Xue Yuqi. Those who continued their efforts and completed the matter were Minister Chen Zhi-ping and Secretaries Sun Biqi and Xue Yuqi. Those who represented the Philippine side in the negotiations were Philippine Foreign Minister and Vice President Quirino, Foreign Deputy Africa, and legal expert Madamba.

### Holding One Skill, Traveling the World: A Record of Chinese Artistic Talents in France

— Paris, February 1st Dispatch from Our Special Correspondent Wang Ren

Woodcarving Craftsman

Since Li Shizeng and other enlightened men advocated frugal study in France, numerous talents have emerged in the past 30 years. For example, Mr. Zhu Zhiqing, a woodcarving craftsman from Nanchong, Sichuan, who lives in the 11th arrondissement of Paris and runs a workshop in a quiet old house, as well as four or five unknown heroes in the artistic world with skillful hands and minds, are worth writing about in detail for their excellent achievements and broad sources of profit, to demonstrate the strength of our Chinese talents and to inspire the spirit of diligence and perseverance of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor. It is said that one of his colleagues who assists in the carving is named Ye Jin from Hangzhou. He is very good at French and also excels in arithmetic. Every night after work, he likes to study radio, excelling in both theory and experimentation. He gathers reference books and the necessary equipment, and during the day, he works as a craftsman in the carving workshop. At night, he studies diligently and has become a radio engineering talent.

Ye married in France 20 years ago, and his two sons and one daughter have all grown up. His daughter is even a lecturer at a school. The family is well-off, and he himself is as carefree as a feudal lord, enjoying human happiness, which is far beyond the imagination of those in the country who "waste their time playing mahjong and busy themselves pursuing fame and fortune."

Mr. Zhu, who supervises all the products to meet French demand, was already able to paint when he went abroad at an early age, and was proficient in figures, flowers, landscapes, and other subjects. When he arrived in Paris, because the franc was gradually rising and the external exchange rate of the national currency was falling daily, he changed his plan to half-study and half-work, attending classes at the art academy on the one hand and setting up his own woodcarving workshop on the other. His products are numerous:

(1) Carved panels, also known as openwork wooden panels. Panneaux Sculptes (such as the two central panels on the upper ends of the left and right doors of the first picture, and the central panels on the left and right bed railings of the third picture), (2) Lacquer carving, which requires lacquering the woodenware more than a dozen times until it is about two fen thick before carving on the lacquer surface.

Westerners Cherish Coromandel

(3) The lacquerware that best demonstrates the characteristics of Chinese craftsmanship is called carved thread, that is, Fujian lacquer, which is first lacquered and then carved, colored, and finely painted to create Coromandel. According to legend, during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Allied forces disturbed Beijing and plundered precious treasures, which were fully loaded and transported to the West. When the warship arrived at the Coromandel coast in eastern British India, it suffered an accident and sank. More than a year later, the objects in the water were salvaged, and everything was destroyed, but the Chinese lacquerware was still as good as new. Westerners cherished this type of lacquerware and gave it the special name Coromandel. All woodenware that is painted with Western lacquer and carved is flawed in that it is afraid of heat. Another advantage of Chinese lacquer is that it is heat-resistant, which makes it particularly popular in Western society. (4) Line engraving Laque Grave first applies lacquer, then draws, and then carves very meticulously, which is also unique to China. (5) Raised gold painting. Relier en or, (6) Relief coloring. Relief en Couleu. The above two are largely similar. (7) Gold line painting Laqued'or, first lacquer, then apply gold paint, then fine gold painting (such as the central panels on the lower half of the left and right kitchen doors in the first circle), (8) Colored painting Polychrome, which is unique to China, divided into ancient and new styles, first apply lacquer, then color, and then fine gold line painting. (9) Inlay Incrustation, first deeply carve patterns or animal, bird, figure, landscape, and other shapes on the board surface, and then fill in with shells Nacre or stone pieces Pierre. This method cannot be produced in Europe and can only be repaired (such as the delicate work on the bed frame below the second Kang bed). The carvings inlaid by the Japanese are first gilded, then inlaid with ivory or fish bones. Japanese carved thread lacquerware is modeled after Chinese Fujian lacquer and has also been improved in its manufacture, always exceeding China's, while colored paintings are made in Persia, which are largely the same as Chinese ones, except that they combine gold painting with fine painting on a gold background. The ancient woodenware of the French Louis XV and XVI dynasties is also divided into "carved thread," "raised gold painting," "gold line painting," and "colored painting." It is said that they were first obtained from the Dutch who sailed to the East, and then France imitated their methods. The most valuable old lacquerware in France is those that are first modeled in France, sent to China for lacquering, and then sent back to Europe.

French Imitate Chinese Paintings

The second best are those that the French imitate Chinese paintings and reproduce locally in Europe. Among Western arts that have benefited from modern maritime transportation and have been subtly influenced by the admiration of Chinese style, other than porcelain, only lacquerware seems to be the case. If someone with a vision collects historical materials, supplements them with illustrations, and compiles a special book on Chinese and foreign woodcarving, it will surely become popular and inspire the Chinese people's confidence in traveling the world with their skills, which is not only beneficial to people's livelihoods but also contributes to the national economy.

### Guerrilla Warfare vs. Banditry!

Before the Lunar New Year, we received an unfortunate piece of news: Yan'an has formally rejected the peace envoys' reopening of negotiations, unless the government recognizes the two conditions they previously proposed. This means the civil war will continue for a long time. Last May, when the National Army captured Changchun, Yan'an announced that they would wage guerrilla warfare for twenty years. On December 19th last year, the Wenhui Bao published Zhou Enlai's remarks: "The CCP will disrupt the government's military offensive within six months, and within a year, the entire government and economic structure of China will undergo major changes." It would be better if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could reach a decisive resolution than the current dragging situation. However, the prospect of major changes to China's entire government and economic structure is truly frightening to us ordinary people. Currently, transportation is disrupted, prices are soaring, and the people are already struggling to breathe under the pressure. If the destruction is further expanded, what kind of situation will China become? It's truly unimaginable. What the CCP calls changing the status quo is essentially extreme destruction, which is the result of guerrilla warfare. After the CCP lost Changchun, Chengde, Huaiyin, Heze, Zhangjiakou, and Andong last year, although there were still fierce battles in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong, the CCP's strategy has largely shifted to guerrilla warfare. They avoid direct conflict with the National Army, evading strength and exploiting weakness, moving hundreds of miles at a time, sometimes east, sometimes west, sometimes south, sometimes north, always unpredictable. Wherever they go, they not only forcibly conscript young men and seize resources, but also destroy everything. This situation is quite similar to the bandits at the end of the Ming Dynasty.

Since Japan's surrender in August two years ago, the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been characterized by talks and fights, fights and talks, talking while fighting, and fighting while talking. Now it has reached the point of a complete break. The government still intends to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an to reopen peace talks, but Yan'an unexpectedly rejected the offer. It seems that guerrilla warfare will continue for a long time. We are all a bit chilled by the future of the country!

Of course, the CCP has ideology and organization, which is absolutely different from bandits. However, the policies it implements and the means it adopts harm the nation's vitality and the people's livelihood. What difference is there from the impact of bandits? If guerrilla warfare continues for ten or twenty years, China will not only lose its position as one of the five great powers in the international arena, but may also fall into the eighteenth level of hell, never to recover. Therefore, we all hope that if the CCP insists on fighting, it might as well engage in a decisive resolution with the National Army, rather than roaming around like bandits, stubbornly clinging to the strategy of guerrilla warfare, only to make the people suffer. At the same time, we also hope that the government will firmly adhere to its policies and not be as indecisive in suppressing bandits as the government at the end of the Ming Dynasty. We ordinary people certainly do not want war, but we cannot bear to drag on any longer. Choosing the lesser of two evils, we would rather have a decisive resolution to the Kuomintang-Communist dispute in the short term. At the same time, we all fervently hope that a miracle will suddenly appear between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and that the two parties will join hands in cooperation and work together to put the country on the path of construction.

Spring and Autumn

### On Guan Liang's Art

— Shi Yan

Mr. Guan Liang is a versatile individual: he is a Western-style painter who has also recently been trying new Chinese paintings; he is also a skilled violinist, fascinated by Chopin's nocturnes; he has a deep understanding of Chinese opera, able to sing, perform, and compose, possessing a thorough understanding of its essence; but the focus of his life's energy is concentrated on the creative work of painting, and his reputation is also based on his achievements in painting. He has dedicated himself to the Chinese art scene for more than twenty years, and he has a profound artistic achievement. In my opinion, he has already established himself as a master. However, his current works are distinctly different from those before the war. He has deeply understood the true meaning of artistic creation, he has established his unique ideas, and he has decided on the direction he should take, so he has produced a new and unique style. This is something worthy of our attention. I have superficially analyzed it, and Mr. Guan Liang's art today has two major characteristics:

(1) Possessing Original Spirit—Art is a kind of creation, not "reproduction" but "expression." When creating an illusion of a beautiful real scene, one should not be constrained by the natural form, but only seek to faithfully imitate the original state of the object. This is "reproduction." The so-called "expression," although it also creates a false image of a beautiful real scene, the formation of this false image uses the writer's unique techniques and incorporates the writer's "personality," giving the work a unique appearance. In other words: this is the so-called "unique spirit." True art must have this kind of creative and original element. If a writer lacks the ability to express himself and only seeks likeness, then he becomes a craftsman.

Mr. Guan Liang's temperament is gentle, elegant, and taciturn. When he speaks, he is soft-spoken and slow-paced, with the demeanor of a scholar. His recent works are quite consistent with this personality. The color tone is simple, rich in a light and lively charm; the brushstrokes are concise, with a thick and solid spirit; the subject matter is even more different from the ordinary, favoring the famous scenic spots of Bashan and Shuishui. Thus, strange peaks, bizarre rocks, and huge streams all appear on his wrist, forming a realm like that of Chinese landscape paintings. Therefore, the composition also breaks away from the cliches of Western landscape paintings, and the arrangement of positions is also similar to the artistic conception of Chinese flat-distance landscape paintings. Therefore, his works show everywhere that they do not fall into the conventional and are full of original spirit.

In addition to watercolor and oil paintings, Mr. Guan Liang also likes to use domestic paper and ink to try new Chinese paintings. With a few simple strokes, he captures the momentary impression and expresses the moving figures. This attempt has also been quite successful. Some say that this is just ink play, or that it resembles Bada Shanren (Zhu Da). I will not criticize it now; however, the refined dots and lines, the contrasting colors, and the expression of the complex temporal dynamics can actually activate the paper. This unique expressive skill cannot be achieved unless the skill reaches a realm of purification. In this, one can also glimpse the author's superb technique and his original spirit.

(2) Rich in National Color—Nationality is also an essential element in artistic creation. An artist is a member of a nation or a country, and his art is naturally a product of the nation. Therefore, if a work of art lacks the elements of nationality, it is like losing its soul. The culture of a country should have the characteristics of that country, and the art of a nation should have its own unique appearance; however, among the Western-style painters in our country, those who can pay attention to this and can do it are truly rare. Since Western art was introduced into China with the tide of the times, most art workers only know how to imitate without understanding, losing the soul of the nation. They not only ignore that culture is a reflection of nationality, and not only do not know the characteristics of the Chinese national spirit; they even reject everything old in China, opposing China's inherent art, thinking it is outdated and backward. The flames of World War II awakened the consciousness of various small and weak nations, and they raised the banner of national liberation one after another, but in China, even after eight years of war against Japan, the degree of awakening of this national consciousness is not very significant, at least the art world is still in a state of semi-sleep. Logically, artists have a keen sense, and the revelation of this consciousness should be particularly strong and become the vanguard of the great era. Fortunately, a few clear-headed writers have realized that blindly learning from the West is no different from being a pawn in Western cultural aggression, and have realized that the situation in which Western painting in China is taking the place of Chinese painting is an abnormal development. If this continues, China's inherent culture will be lost, and they have realized that absorbing foreign cultures should not be swallowed whole, but should be chewed carefully and digested to become their own nourishment and become their own blood. Therefore, they turned back and, relying on their latent national consciousness, restored their efforts in their own position, using the foundation of Western painting to change their style to express the essence of the national spirit. The reason for Mr. Guan Liang's style change may not be as I said. There are more than one reason for the change, and factors such as the times, age, and thought are all related; but the trend of his change is to return to the embrace of the nation and to stand on the post of his own duty. This is a fact—a valuable fact. In his paintings, whether from the perspective of composition, color tone, or brushstrokes, they are full of tranquil, indifferent, and transcendent emotions. Although the materials are Western, the inner essence is full of Chinese style and the consistent spirit of the Chinese nation. Some believe that this is due to the influence of the Impressionist school in the late Western period, but in his paintings, one cannot find the shadows of Cézanne, Gauguin, or Matisse. Nowadays, most art connoisseurs and Western-style painters still maintain the same pace and consistent ideas. Their position is mostly Western. Writers pay attention to the West and imitate the West. Appreciators also like to compare them with Western writers when appreciating the Western-style paintings of Chinese people. This view of losing one's soul and forgetting one's motherland often arouses my potential sadness. Is it true that after the national crisis, one cannot jump out of the shackles of imitation for a lifetime? Will there never be an original writer? I feel that Mr. Guan's painting style is full of creativity. In addition to explaining it with the phrase "the revelation of Chinese nationality," other metaphors are quite far-fetched and boring.

Zhao Xigu, a scholar in the Southern Song Dynasty, once said about painting:

"Hiding ten thousand volumes of poems in one's heart, and having thoroughly viewed the masterpieces of the previous generations, having traveled almost all over the world, then can one pick up the brush. How can this be done by inferior people?"

These few words are quite thought-provoking. Because Mr. Guan likes to travel and enjoy the mountains and rivers, his mind is broad and his brushstrokes are extraordinary. The reason why his works can stand out as a unique style is probably due to this.

### Han Anyi's Oil Paintings

— Wen Zhaotong

It is a pity to say, the new art movement in China has been launched for more than thirty-five years, but relatively scientific oil painting techniques still do not attract much attention and application, and the so-called Chinese art is indeed stagnant on materials such as brushes, ink, and Xuan paper. Of course, artistic creation is not simply tied to materials, but the use of materials will ultimately determine the progress and stagnation of art.

In Western art, oil painting is the main artistic material because it has a high degree of expressive effect, and it also constitutes the main technique of plastic arts. No matter in which country, or which writer, the works that can be listed as important works of art or representative works are always oil paintings. Also, because it can be broken down into complex hues, the Impressionist movement in the second half of the 19th century also used oil painting as its main material to describe the changes in color and light.

Looking back at the progress of the new art movement in our country, oil painting was also popular for a while, but since the War of Resistance, general writers have been forced by material and life threats, and the production and research of oil painting have almost been replaced by Chinese painting. Because Chinese painting can be exchanged for money and solve life problems, although in some places, writers are catering to the psychology of the nouveau riche, the poverty of artists has also been relieved.

Of course, we can also say that Chinese painting is the superior tradition of our culture, and studying Chinese painting is a good trend. However, we rush to embrace the scientific material production of Europe and the United States. Why do we abandon the oil painting techniques and materials that have been scientifically baptized?

Ms. Han Anyi is a young writer who concentrates on the study of oil. She has been quite active in the Shanghai art scene in the past five or six years. Her works have been displayed in the Shanghai Western Painters Joint Exhibition in 1940, the Modern Art Exhibition in 1941, and the Shanghai Art Writers Association Exhibition and Victory Art Exhibition twice last year. In terms of her style, she is only following the correct path after Cézanne in the early 20th century. Therefore, the expression of texture is very solid, and this "Fish" has the characteristics of Trump's new realism. In her many landscape paintings, one can often feel the innocent interest of Henri Rousseau. This is a unique tendency of subjective expression art, and it is also a consistent tendency of modern art.

In the current stage of the Chinese art world, how few people are studying oil painting. Therefore, Ms. Han Anyi's consistent dedication to oil painting is a testament to her artistic sincerity, and we should do everything we can to promote her development and growth. Because: The creation of new art in China will ultimately make oil painting techniques one of the main factors.

It is said that Ms. Han is preparing for a solo exhibition. I will introduce it in advance to attract the attention of art lovers and also to give her some small encouragement.

### Early Morning

— D. L. Knight

### Formerly, Zheng Wuchang's landscape painting was combined with brocade and given to Lou Peilan. It was lost due to the chaos of war, and after returning to Beijing, it was suddenly found in a desolate stall. Therefore, I requested a re-inscription.

— Qian Zhixiu

Lord Lou has the vastness of China in his chest, and his passion for good things cannot be matched by anyone. He loves mountains and paintings all his life, and the Yandong factory is full of treasures. I got Zheng Wuchang's travel record, the mountains and rocks are withered and thin, and the mountains are layered upon layers. I hung it on the plain wall of your new residence, and the wind blows through the tall house with a cold rustling sound. When the island barbarians invaded, they wielded sharp spears, and the deer roamed everywhere in the anxious capital. All the officials turned into magpies flying south, and you also bought a boat to go west. Returning, the four walls are empty, but there are dusty cobwebs and spiders. You value me more, and value the painting even more, and laboriously searched the desolate stalls. My eyes suddenly lit up as if I had found an old sword, and my heart was as happy as drinking pure wine. I believe that things gather where they are liked, and events are helped by heaven, not human plans. I was born to entrust things, but things do not stay, and I have long been ashamed of being a cowherd in vain. What is there to do with the cold and tattered green felt? It is but a fleeting cloud passing before my eyes. Why should I care if the Chu bow is obtained by me? And how can the bright pearl be thrown in the dark? I inscribe a poem to repay your earnest intention, but I wish that the friendship of gold and stone will last forever with this painting for thousands of years.

### Answering Lord Jingyu, Rhyming with the Original Poem

— Zheng Wuchang

Remaining mountains and waters tell the story of China, and one corner of Ma Yuan's heart is cast. How could the affectionate scholar Qian value it so much, not losing it like a precious jewel? The smoke and clouds pass before the eyes like idle things, and it can be said that they are cultivated in seclusion with pleasure. Lord Lou has a peerless common interest, and every time we talk about the hills and valleys, the wind rustles. Don't dislike the clumsy scribbles on the barrier, and sit facing each other on the Hu bed, enjoying the scenery. In times of chaos, cultural relics are cheaper than dirt, and the west hunt and east patrol overturned the boat. Where the captive's hooves trampled, there was no complete house, only the remaining human bones and spiders. Returning to the spring city, the grass and trees are deep, why spend so much effort to search for a foot of silk? The relationship with calligraphy and painting may be destined, and getting it is so happy that the wine fills the cup. The rivers and mountains are renewed, and the painting is returned, which is a blessing from heaven, not a human plan. Thank you for loving me more than Liang Qianwei, but I am ashamed that my hand is not as good as Gu Hutou. How can I travel all over the Five Sacred Mountains and follow the raft to float on the four seas? I will write down thousands of strange and wonderful pictures and throw them all on the walls of the noble and bright. The small gains and losses cause joy and sorrow, and the friendship is testified on paper for thousands of years.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 166

— Ye Jingfeng

Mr. W, in performing his duties and in punishing his subordinates, has a heart that is as hard as steel. However, after hearing me recite these few sentences, he was already gnashing his teeth, and it looked like he was extremely angry, and a circle of redness had already appeared around his eyes. At this time, he was looking at me, meaning to let me read the letter down:

"According to Mr. Shen, my wife and two daughters committed suicide by hanging themselves, fearing that they would be trampled on by beasts. They died very cleanly, which can slightly comfort my heart; because although they died a violent death, it is still better than the more than one hundred innocent women in Changxindian who were raped by Japanese invaders and wanted to die but could not! Mr. Shen also said that the corpses of my wife and two daughters had several gunshot wounds and knife wounds, but there was not much bleeding, presumably the wounds were inflicted after they were already dead. What hatred do the enemy beasts have? They must want to mutilate the corpses? Are they angry that they did not kill them earlier and did not satisfy their bestial desires? I heard that the deaths of the two daughters were extremely tragic. They each had several knife wounds and their limbs were also torn apart. Their fingernails were curled up, and there were broken hairs and pieces of cloth left behind. It must have been that before they died, they fought bravely with the bandits to defend their flesh and blood. The bandits were many and also possessed sharp weapons. The two daughters were young and weak, but they dared to provoke the bandits' anger. They had already embraced the determination to die. The youngest daughter, Dingxiang, was only eight years old and weak. Mr. Shen said that her clothes had almost been stripped off, and there were fingernail scratches on her lower abdomen. Her eyes were wide open, and she died from excessive fright. It was also tragic. Of the whole family of seven, I am the only one left alive. What is the point of living? I have attempted suicide several times, but I was rescued by doctors and nurses. Mr. Shen said that I should reluctantly keep the remaining breath and sacrifice myself to serve the country. If the country wins, then there will be a day to avenge my family. His words are sincere and heroic, but I am in so much pain from this change that my mind is weak and my heart is sick. How can I ride a horse and kill the bandits? I heard that the bandits have already entered the city. Rather than sit and wait for death, it is better to break into the bandits' camp and make a desperate gamble with the pistol borrowed from Mr. Shen. If my wife and children have knowledge of their deaths, they will surely help me kill more bandits. Farewell, my brother. If what the Buddha said is not false, I will repay you in the next life. Your younger brother, Dingyuan, bows his head."

"Alas!" The four people sighed in unison after hearing me read the letter.

After sighing, I looked at everyone and saw that their expressions all contained a surge of anger, a ball of resentment, mixed with infinite sadness. This emotional impulse and agitation created an extremely low pressure in the room. Silence, silence, silence for more than three minutes.

"It's almost five-thirty." Mr. W looked at his watch, his voice a little hoarse.

"I support the plan for tonight's raid!" He Jian felt that his nerves were overly strained and a little tired. He picked up a chair and sat down facing Mr. W. "But…" He pondered for a moment, "But I have a little contribution. From my point of view—of course, I have not yet heard your raid deployment—I think that even if it is a raid, there is no need to be overly adventurous; excessive risk will inevitably lead to great sacrifices…"

"That's right!" Mr. W nodded constantly.

"I think the Japanese army's strength is very strong in the city and suburbs now. According to the information at noon, seventy or eighty percent of the country's regular army has been moved south of Changxindian; the remaining twenty or thirty percent are surrounded and are being depleted. This can explain the strength situation on both sides. To put it more thoroughly, the potential for special agents in our part has reached a period where they should be lurking deeper and more secretly!…" He Jian was implying that Mr. W and his subordinates should from now on change to "underground work."

"That's right!" Mr. W expressed his strong agreement with He Jian's analysis. The few of us all nodded silently.

"From this point of view, there is nothing wrong with the raid; but we must also consider the consequences of the raid: for example, how we will handle the aftermath after the raid. I grew up in Japan and have also been in the Japanese army until I was twenty-six or twenty-seven years old this year. I know that Japanese soldiers, especially the soldiers in this area, are all rascals!…"

When we heard this, we not only tacitly agreed that He Jian's words were correct, but we almost wanted to applaud and cheer if we were not afraid of disrupting this sacred tension and disturbing He Jian's thoughts.

Freedom Forum

### A Trivial Account 1946 Various Aspects of America, Brevity

— Translated by Xi Shi from the English Great American Evening News

The news figures of America in 1946 were: miners' leader Lewis, former Secretary of State Byrnes, Republican leader Taft, automobile tycoon Henry Ford II, playwright O'Neill, comedian Bob Hope, and baseball star Ted Williams.

Seven News Figures

Lewis ranked first among the seven news figures. His two leaderships of coal miners' strikes not only affected every American family, but also most European countries. The first major strike was in April, and the second was in November. Both strikes hindered America's "reconversion" plan, increased unemployment, and forced the entire nation to greatly conserve electricity and heat. The first strike ended with the federal government taking over the coal mines, and the second strike resulted in a court fining Lewis $10,000 and the union $3.5 million. Lewis ordered the workers to return to work during the appeal period. These two major strikes made Lewis the number one news figure in America in 1946.

Former Secretary of State Byrnes was the second news figure. Throughout the year, Byrnes represented the United States at various international conferences, large and small. He was the spokesman for bipartisan foreign policy, and the departure of Wallace further enhanced Byrnes' prestige. Byrnes played a most active role in the two United Nations meetings held in London and New York, the two meetings of the four foreign ministers, the United Nations Security Council meetings, and the Paris Peace Conference, making him the second news figure.

The third news figure was Taft, who was a former Republican presidential candidate. The Republican victory in November increased his importance. He is highly likely to be the Republican presidential candidate in 1948 and also highly likely to be the next president of the United States. He strongly criticized American domestic policy, advocating that the government should adopt a tough labor policy, but opposed banning strikes.

Automobile tycoon Henry Ford II is the grandson of old Ford. At the age of 29 this year, his automobile factory occupies a very important position in the American reconversion plan. He only began to take over the Ford factory in 1945. After taking power, he fired several senior executives. In 1946, his position was extremely solid, making him an outstanding figure in the American industrial sector.

Eugene O'Neill's play "The Iceman Cometh" was written in 1939, but it was not staged on Broadway until last year. It was O'Neill's first play since 1934, and it was extremely successful. Comedian Bob Hope and baseball star Ted Williams were also news figures that Americans paid attention to.

In addition to these major national news stories, many interesting small news stories emerged in America last year:

Minor, Laughable Events

In January, a thief in Boling saw an old woman at a tram stop waiting for a tram, carrying a heavy, full leather bag. He hurried forward to offer his assistance, wanting to carry the bag for the old woman. As soon as the bag was in his hand, the thief took off running, disappearing in an instant. It was just a pity that he didn't know that the bag contained the old woman's dead dog, which she was about to bury.

In February, a discharged soldier returned to his hometown in Sparta, wanting to surprise his family. He sneaked into the house in the middle of the night, ran into his parents' bedroom, turned on the lights, and shouted, "Guess who's here?" Two young people stuck their heads out of the bed, roaring and standing up. It turned out to be two strangers; his parents had already moved.

In March, a female performer in Chicago had to join the local musicians' union in order to play eight notes on the piano in a play. A man in California had to go to the hospital for a cup of coffee: because the coffee was too hot, he drank it too quickly, choked, and knocked out a set of dentures, cutting his lips. He was shocked and fell off the chair, hitting his head on the corner of the table, tearing a seam in his ear.

In April, the zoo in Biborough had to install more fences, because visitors liked to touch the lions in the cages.

The Reason for the Blue Color of Seawater

A long-unresolved problem has received new reports in the war researching and attempting to use light to combat submarines.

In attempting to find a way to resist German submarines, two American scientists discovered that there are 1.5 million dust-like particles in every cubic inch of seawater, each particle having a diameter of about one fifty-millionth of an inch. These particles can reflect sunlight to the surface of the sea. However, the light is filtered when it is reflected to the surface of the water. Water absorbs red and yellow light, leaving green, blue, and purple light, which mixes to form the indigo color of seawater.

The Almighty Aircraft L-13

Military communication aircraft can be described as a type of almighty aircraft.

Equipped with foldable wings and adjustable landing wheels, it can be towed by a military vehicle on uneven ground or loaded onto a truck. By replacing the landing wheels with sleds, it can land on snow. Or equipped with floats, it can be launched from harbor bases. Without removing the propeller, it can be towed up by another aircraft, like a glider, and then use its own power.

It can take off in 230 feet and land in 227 feet at 43 and a half miles per hour. The entire body is metal, and the wingspan is 40 and a half feet. Its name is L-13. (Translated from the February issue of Scientific Digest.)

### A Soul-Stirring Night of Hexagonal Romance

— Yun

Due to fierce competition among peers, Hollywood today seems to be popularizing grand performances with "several headliners performing at the same time." "Night of Ecstasy," which will be released at the Majestic Theater following "Since You Left," is one of the new films completed by Universal Pictures under this policy.

In "Night of Ecstasy," there are two male and female leads. Susanna Foster is the latest work of Louise Albritton, the female lead in "Phantom of the Opera." David Bruce, the male lead, we recently saw in "Can't Help Singing." Franchot Tone is even more familiar to the public. With these four collaborating on a film, the results should not be disappointing.

This is a musical comedy. Foster started as a singer, and in this film, she plays a café clerk who has a very eager "stage fever." She is eager to get on stage, even ignoring the love of the shop owner. Later, in her eagerness to get on stage, she went to a famous theater authority, claiming to be the daughter born to his divorced wife. He knew it was fake, but was bewitched by her beauty and expressed his love. However, this authority also has his lover. Seeing his lover being touched, unwilling to give in, he tried to find the divorced wife, wanting to prove that the daughter was fake. However, this divorced wife had a role to play, making the fake seem real. The authority rekindled his old feelings and wanted to relive the old days, but coincidentally, the former's current husband also heard the news and rushed over. This situation became extremely complicated. In the end, naturally, the three pairs of lovers each formed their own families, and Foster's dream of getting on stage was also realized. Hollywood filmmakers often like to use this kind of intricate relationship to create laughter. If this arrangement can be used effectively, it can indeed increase a lot of comedic effect.

Old comedian Mischa Auer also participates in this film, maintaining his consistent deadpan style. He plays a waiter in a food shop, but has a problem of not being able to "see food." This may cause a lot of jokes.

Tired of leg shows, a lighthearted comedy can also adjust your spirits.
