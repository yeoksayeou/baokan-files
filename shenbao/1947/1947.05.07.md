[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Army, under the command of Wang Jingjiu, departed from Dawenkou northward at 11:30 AM on the 6th, retaking Tai'an. The Communist 10th Column fled eastward. Communist casualties in this battle reached eight to nine thousand. With the recapture of Tai'an, the east-west lines of the Hong Army were severed again, and the encirclement of the Communists became smaller. The Jinpu Railway traffic was thus able to resume.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 6th] The National Army on the Jinpu front in central Shandong advanced with unstoppable momentum, retaking Tai'an at 11:30 AM on the 6th. The remaining Communist forces fled eastward. The National Army seized a large amount of supplies, and the battle results are being assessed. At 12:00 noon, the National Army moving north from Dawenkou and the National Army under Wang Yaowu moving south from Jieshou officially converged at Tai'an, Xuzhou. Traffic between Jinan was also officially restored. The Communist forces in western Shandong and the Yimeng Mountains have been completely isolated and dismembered and can be defeated and annihilated one by one.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 6th] A major battle to annihilate the main force of the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains of central Shandong is about to begin. The remnants of the Communist 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 10th Columns, totaling more than 50,000 men, who fled east from Tai'an and Feicheng, are currently concentrated in the triangle area of Xintai, Laiwu, and Tai'an, attempting to take advantage of any opportunity to make trouble. However, the National Army has already detected their conspiracy and quickly adopted a preemptive strategy. The Xintai National Army launched attacks in two routes on the morning of the 5th. The right-wing National Army recovered Nanshidian, 30 kilometers south of Laiwu, and the highlands north of Jindoushan at 9:00 AM on the 5th. The left-wing National Army recovered Zhushan and Dongxiyu, 20 kilometers northwest of Xintai, at noon on the 5th. This group of Communist forces is now trapped in the National Army's pocket formation and can be annihilated in one fell swoop.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 6th] The National Army in southern and central Shandong continued to advance on the 6th. Tai'an and Laiwu are both under the control of the National Army, and an offensive battle is about to begin. The main force of the Communist army is now all on the periphery of Xintai and Mengyin.

This group of Communist soldiers surrendered without being attacked. According to their confession, they were mostly militiamen who did not want to follow the Communist army when it retreated and hid in the caves, waiting for the arrival of the National Army. The National Army has comforted and accommodated them.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 6th] The National Army's mopping-up troops in central Shandong recovered Tumen, 15 kilometers east of Xintai, at noon on the 5th, annihilating more than 1,000 Communist soldiers, capturing more than 100, and seizing more than 100 long and short guns.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 5th] The Communist army entered Shouyang on the 5th. Communist Yang Chengwu abandoned the fertile areas of Jizhou and Gaoyang in Hebei, and led nine brigades, totaling forty to fifty thousand men, to invade the Zhengtai Line like frogs, fiercely attacking Yangquan and Pinding unsuccessfully, and drilling in to besiege Shouyang, engaging in fierce fighting with a certain unit that had distinguished itself in the Fenxiao campaign in the vicinity of Ceshi, attempting to strike these two powerful National Army units. However, a certain commander-in-chief in command at Shouyang and a certain general supervising the battle at Ceshi, after inflicting tens of thousands of casualties on the Communist army, safely led their troops to an area of active operations on the 5th. This strategic attempt by the Communist army has failed. The two armies are now in a standoff on the line from the northeast of Yuci through Zongai Lingjing (Meng County) to Yangxingzhen (east of Shicengguan) in Yangqu, strengthening the defense of Taiyuan.

### External Affairs Ministry to Issue Statement Clarifying Our Position on the Lushun-Dalian Issue, Gong Xuesui Reaffirms Good Neighbor Policy

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a statement soon regarding the acceptance of Lushun-Dalian, clarifying our nation's position. According to reports, Soviet Ambassador Petrov visited Foreign Minister Wang on the afternoon of the 5th to respond to our previous note. The Foreign Ministry declined to announce the contents of the Soviet response.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] Gong Xuesui received reporters at 4 p.m. on the 6th and stated, "The issue of receiving Dalian is of utmost concern to both Chinese and foreign individuals. The current government is negotiating with allied nations through diplomatic channels. Once the negotiations have a result, and the central government issues an order, we can proceed with the acceptance. Mr. Gong continued to state that the sovereignty of Dalian is clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, and not only do China and the Soviet Union have a mutual obligation to comply, but it is also of great importance to peace in the Far East. As for the key points of my administration after taking over Dalian, I will adhere to the good neighbor policy to establish friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, stabilize local order, provide relief to refugees, promote industry and commerce, and develop education as the foundation."

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 6th] Ti Xuesui visited Du Yuming on the evening of the 5th and went to various offices of the Northeast Headquarters on the morning of the 6th, and received reporters at 4 p.m. According to Mr. Xi, everyone has the opportunity to develop industry and commerce based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, and the treaty is accompanied by naval maps. The maps of the Jin City District of Lushun-Dalian are not attached, but original maps are available for reference.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 6th] Regarding the Lushun-Dalian reception issue, the crux of the matter, it is said, remains the troop deployment issue. The opinions of China and the Soviet Union have not converged. Furthermore, the Dalian municipal government feels that personnel and funding are insufficient, and a training session for reception personnel. can begin next week.

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] According to sources familiar with the situation, the Soviet response to the Lushun-Dalian issue is not satisfactory. However, the content of the response cannot be disclosed. The Soviet Union's position on the Lushun area is based on the premise that "a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed, so the state of war continues technically." China believes that this position is not in line with reality, as Japan has long been defeated and has become an occupied country. The sovereignty of Dalian and Lushun, like other areas north of Yan, belongs entirely to China, as clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty. If there are communist troops in the suburbs of Dalian and China has no troops to protect it, there is little hope of receiving the administration of the area. Merely relying on the police is obviously insufficient.

### Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters Formulates Measures to Stabilize Commodity Prices, Guan Jiyu and Others Serve as Executive Committee Members to Strictly Implement

### Editorial: Facing the Current Economic Crisis

In the past two weeks, rice prices have skyrocketed, and all other prices have risen in a straight line. The rate of increase is truly alarming, threatening everyone's livelihood, especially those who rely on salaries or wages for income, who are almost in a state of constant anxiety. Since the government implemented emergency economic measures in mid-February, the cost of living index has been frozen. However, prices have not only failed to stabilize but have continued to rise day by day. Taking rice prices as an example, they have increased two or three times in the past two months. In this state of imbalance between prices and wages, the calls for unfreezing the cost of living index have also risen with the soaring prices. This issue has not only attracted social attention but has also been emphasized by the government. According to our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, the Executive Yuan also discussed the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index at its meeting yesterday morning. It is reported that agreement has been reached in principle, but the specific measures for unfreezing are still under deliberation. It is expected that this issue will be reasonably resolved around the middle of this month. However, amidst the skyrocketing prices, in addition to the nationwide workers' demand to unfreeze the cost of living index, what concerns us most is the treatment of civil servants and soldiers who serve the country. With their meager income, they are almost unable to survive under the pressure of current high prices. The impact on the country and society will also be very close, making it impossible for us not to appeal to the government and the public to arouse everyone's attention.

The postwar economic difficulties in our country are undeniable facts, and there is no need to shy away from them. In fact, in the postwar world, even in countries like Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, after long periods of war, no country has not been plagued by food shortages and fuel shortages, and no country has not been complaining about economic difficulties. However, they mostly have good strategies and ingenious plans, and each has its own proper methods for dealing with postwar economic difficulties. For example, in Britain, the economic difficulties are no less than in our country. Foreign Secretary Bevin recently returned from Moscow and said with great indignation: The most difficult thing for Britain in diplomacy is that Britain "has neither coal for export nor goods and funds to lend to other countries."

Britain's inability to take care of itself economically can be clearly seen from this. The second is France. During the Blum cabinet, due to the high prices, labor unrest spread across the country. Therefore, it resolutely implemented a policy to suppress prices. Although it was effective for a while, by the time of the Ramadier cabinet, the policy of suppressing prices did not achieve the expected results. As a result, the workers' movement to demand wage increases arose from this. The Communist Party supported the workers' demands and voted against the cabinet's policy, which caused a huge wave in the political arena, forcing the Communist Party members of the cabinet to withdraw. This political turmoil has come to an end, but it is still difficult to predict how the political situation in France will evolve in the future. Finally, there is the Soviet Union. The rapid recovery of the Soviet Union after the war is indeed admirable, but the damage suffered by the Soviet Union during the war was too great and too deep. Therefore, it still feels considerable economic difficulties. The first issue of domestic bonds is about to be used up, and now it has to issue a second issue of domestic bonds worth 200 billion rubles. This point alone can show the whole picture of the Soviet economy.

However, in countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, no matter how scarce resources are and no matter how difficult the economy is, they can still maintain the calm of the national economic life. Especially in Britain, the daily necessities of the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation still implement the wartime rationing system. London has never experienced a black market due to the scarcity of necessities. Recently, the British people have also launched a national savings movement to help the government complete the great cause of recovery and prosperity as soon as possible. Britain has never been like our country, often experiencing waves of soaring prices. From this point of view, we dare to say boldly that although our country's economy is extremely difficult, it is by no means impossible to stabilize people's livelihoods and stabilize prices. The constant rise in prices in our country after the war has various reasons. However, the main reason is that our authorities have failed to plan comprehensively and establish a complete economic policy, only knowing how to treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. Moreover, the prescriptions for treating the head and the foot often change from morning to evening. Before the plan is implemented, a new plan is changed. Reviewing the economic policies of the past two years after the war, we cannot but point out that the economic policies during the period of President Song failed due to free trade, completely ignorant of cherishing foreign exchange, and allowing people to freely order materials from abroad, resulting in foreign goods flooding the market, industrial and commercial decline, and exhaustion of foreign exchange, making it impossible to support. Later, although it has realized and adopted control measures, the flood has already flooded, and repairing the dikes is no longer recoverable. The emergency economic measures implemented in February this year were produced in this way. However, this measure was not implemented for a long time, and President Song resigned, and the government was brewing a reorganization. It was not until the end of April that the reorganized new government was established. Therefore, this emergency measure can be said to have never been effectively implemented. Moreover, when President Zhang attended the Legislative Yuan for the first time, he frankly stated that the emergency economic measures would be revised or abolished. At the same time, the price limit for rice in Shanghai was also ordered to be abolished and allowed to be traded freely. Even the simplest-minded person would know that the government's economic policy will have fundamental changes. What's more, Shanghai has always been a speculative market, and when nothing is happening, it often has to catch wind and shadows and try to make waves. Now that they have heard President Zhang's statement, it is certainly an excellent reason for speculation. Therefore, the chaos in the market these days is indeed caused by human factors. However, the government's contradictory words and deeds cannot but bear considerable responsibility. We have to point out the following two points here to awaken the attention of the whole country.

First, we believe that the reorganized new government should choose one of the following two paths to cope with the current economic difficulties. One is to inherit the economic policies of President Song's era, strengthen economic control, and effectively implement emergency economic measures until the goal is achieved. The second is to adopt new plans and implement new methods. But if the government abandons the old road and takes the new road, we ask the government to pay attention to the following points. (1) New policies must be carefully considered and considered absolutely certain before they can be adopted. Do not try them out with an experimental attitude. (2) When policies change, be sure to keep them secret, because before and after policies change, it is easiest to cause financial turmoil. (3) To adopt a new plan, we must immediately come up with a solution and can no longer delay.

Second, we want everyone in the society to recognize the current crisis. If we do not find a way to save it as soon as possible, then in the long run, it will only create opportunities for the Communist Party. We all know that communism is not suitable for China, because Chinese society does not have a disparity between the rich and the poor. However, the current economic situation is accelerating the differentiation of society into two major classes. People who can speculate and take advantage can become rich overnight. Honest and law-abiding legitimate businessmen cannot stand in society. If this situation cannot be saved by the policy of the Three Principles of the People, then is today's society not creating opportunities for the Communist Party!

In short, the current domestic economic situation is extremely serious and has reached the edge of total collapse. However, we still believe that human power can overcome nature. As long as the whole country, from top to bottom, can recognize a common goal and work together with one heart, it can overcome all difficulties. The difficulties that other countries can safely overcome, we believe that our country will also be able to overcome safely and reach the other shore of prosperity and strength!

### Issue of Jewish Representatives' Attendance: UN General Assembly Passes Compromise Plan: Allowed to State Opinions in the Political Committee

[Agence France-Presse, New York, Flushing Meadow, 5th] The United Nations General Assembly, in plenary session today, passed a resolution by a vote of 44 to 7, with 3 abstentions, instructing the Political Committee to hear the opinions of representatives of the Jewish Agency on the Palestine issue. The resolution also stipulates that the opinions of other parts of the Palestinian people should be decided by the Political Committee, which is the result of a compromise between the Bland proposal and the American proposal. A proposal by the Czech Republic and Poland that representatives of the Jewish Agency express their opinions to the General Assembly was rejected by a vote of 39 to 8, with 7 abstentions. After the method of Jewish representatives' statements was decided, attention is now focused on the question of the Palestine High Committee's request to make a statement. It is reported that the Arab League has instructed its member states to insist that if representatives of the Jewish Agency are allowed to make a statement, the Arab High Committee must also be allowed to make a statement.

[Associated Press, New York, 5th] The Chairman of the UN General Assembly's Political Committee, Canadian representative Pearson, convened the committee to meet this morning to begin organizing the Palestine Investigation Committee.

[Reuters to Flushing, 5th] The United Nations Special General Assembly decided today to allow the Jewish Agency to present its views to the General Assembly's Political Committee.

### British Imperial Chiefs of Staff Conference: Discussing Cooperation Between the Navy, Army, and Air Force: Commanders-in-Chief of Overseas British Troops Are All in Attendance

[Central News Agency, London, 5th Special Telegram] Britain's largest postwar defense conference began today. The attendees included the Commanders-in-Chief of Britain and the British Empire, including 76 field marshals and generals, 44 naval admirals and senior naval officers, 5 marine generals, and some senior air force officers.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] British army, navy, and air force generals held a secret meeting at the Sandhurst Military Academy today, chaired by Field Marshal Montgomery, Chief of the General Staff. This is the most important military conference since the planning of the Normandy landing. British military commanders from all over the world, such as General Robertson, Commander-in-Chief of the British Occupation Forces in Japan, were summoned back to the country to participate in the conference. According to informed sources, in view of the fact that British senior generals believe that the separation of the army, navy, and air force is an outdated system in modern warfare, this conference will discuss the close cooperation between the three services. In addition, the issue of new weapons and their uses will also be discussed. As far as air power is concerned, the Commander of the Royal Air Force once said that the advent of the atomic age means the disappearance of large-scale bombing teams. It is reported that the Navy Department is still unable to determine the impact of atomic bombs on the navy. Some parties expect the navy to use aircraft carriers to carry atomic-bomb-equipped aircraft, but the problem of using merchant fleets and escort teams cannot be solved as a result.

### Turkish President Receives US Fleet Commander

[Reuters, Istanbul, 5th] Turkish President Inonu suddenly arrived here from Ankara today to receive US Mediterranean Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Billie, who is leading four US warships, including the 27,000-ton aircraft carrier Leyte, on a six-week cruise in the Mediterranean.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Voice of Jinshan broadcasted on the 6th: Turkish President Inonu reviewed the US fleet and Turkish warships that recently arrived in the Dardanelles Strait today. US and Turkish warships fired a 21-gun salute. The Turkish President delivered a speech, which stated that Turkey has a deep understanding of the friendship and importance of the US fleet's visit to Turkey. After the speech, US and Turkish naval personnel cheered loudly.

### House Begins Debate on US Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill

The Opposition Party Will Hinder All Attempts

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Political figures here said last night that when the House of Representatives begins debating Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey today, all opponents will go all out, most of whom are Wallace's supporters and old-fashioned isolationists. They all believe that spending $400 million to stop the spread of communism will ultimately be futile. Political figures also predicted that when the bill is submitted to the House, the opposition will first demand that the entire plan be sent to the United Nations. If this motion is rejected, they will probably demand that it be sent to the Military Committee for discussion, because this bill has a military nature. If both motions fail, a few Republican senators will try to remove its military clauses to cancel aid to Turkey. House leaders said that although the opponents are active, the aid bill is expected to be passed by a satisfactory majority in the House.

### Izvestia Comments on Marshall's Speech: Says Its Purpose Is to Blame the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, Moscow, 5th] "Izvestia" published a long editorial today, explaining the Soviet Union's previous clear and determined attitude, accusing the US State Department of supporting reactionaries, "encouraging hostility towards the Soviet Union," and condemning US Secretary of State Marshall for "blaming the Soviet Union" for the failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, "intending to slander." Most Soviet people believe that the US State Department is generally anti-Soviet and do not deny it, but this "Izvestia" editorial is particularly sharp. It is said that Marshall's broadcast report to the American people on April 28 about the progress of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was "untrue." Senator Vandenberg said that Marshall's speech had been discussed in advance by the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties at the White House, which shows that the general anti-Soviet sentiment is even deeper than that of the State Department. Marshall's speech has given people a "wrong impression" of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, blaming the Soviet delegation for lacking sincerity in the agreement, in order to prove the legitimacy of his own actions and arouse the American people's dissatisfaction with Soviet policy. Marshall's advisor Dulles' broadcast report on the conference's work also "distorted the facts." Marshall gave the conference an inaccurate assessment, obviously because the positions of the US and British representatives when debating the German issue were by no means a genuine guarantee of trying to establish sound peace and prevent aggression.

### The Political and Legal Situation Remains Unstable; the US May Help France Address the Economic Crisis, but Only on the Condition of Implementing Anti-Communist Policies

[Our Own Correspondent] London, 6th Dispatch: The French government's open rejection of the Communist Party is a first attempt since the liberation, and this policy is now facing a serious test. Four hundred representatives of the Socialist Party convened a national conference today to vote on the expulsion of the five Communist ministers from the coalition cabinet. If rejected, the government will collapse, and France will face its most serious political crisis in recent years.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th Dispatch] Although the political storm in France on Sunday has subsided, the political situation remains unstable as the Socialist Party convenes a national congress to make a final decision on the reorganization of the Ramadier cabinet. Political figures here say that Ramadier will likely form a cabinet without the participation of the Communist Party, in accordance with the agreement of the Socialist Party's parliamentary group. The majority opinion of the national congress will likely support this proposal, but the opinions of Socialist Party members in the provinces will also be taken into consideration. Regarding the economic adjustment measures of the future cabinet, the Radical Party will try to implement a more liberal economic policy than that adopted by the Minister of National Economy, Philip, or may propose to replace the Minister of Economy. It is reported that the parliamentary group of the People's Republican Movement held a meeting yesterday, and Vice Premier and party leader De Gaulle praised the Communist Party's understanding of the government's problems and its goodwill in seeking solutions. Some observers here speculate that if the Socialist Party's national congress refuses to break with the Communist Party, the People's Republican Movement may propose to lead the next cabinet. At the same time, political observers are paying close attention to the French General Confederation of Labor's support for wage earners and its demands for improved living conditions. People expect that the current unexpected state of calm in Paris may be followed by a situation of social difficulty.

[Associated Press, Paris, 5th Dispatch] Senior US officials announced today that the United States may step up aid to France's economic crisis, but only on the condition that Prime Minister Ramadier can unite his new non-Communist coalition cabinet. It is reported that officials from the US Embassy are drafting a detailed report on what kind of assistance the French government needs and the amount of assistance. It is expected that France will have new demands for solving food, fuel, and industrial problems, so the report must be revised before it can be sent to Washington. The decisive factor in the United States' willingness to support this new anti-Communist bulwark in Western Europe depends on whether the French Socialist Party led by Ramadier is willing to become a tool for implementing the United States' anti-Communist policy. If the Socialist Party can continue to lead the anti-Communist coalition cabinet, the United States is expected to sympathize and help it maintain economic policies such as freezing wages, curbing prices, and increasing production. Other people also said that the US attitude has been conveyed by the US Ambassador to France, Caffery, to the leaders of parties other than the Communist Party. However, it is rumored that the Communist Party may use its potential to control six million members of the trade union federation to instigate a general strike.

### French Labor Unions Launch Labor War Against the Government

[United Press, Paris, 5th Dispatch] After the French government rejected the five Communist ministers from the government, the Communist-controlled labor unions have launched a labor war against the government, and the wave of strikes and wage increase demands is spreading across the country. It is estimated that the number of strikers has reached as many as 42,000, and another 13,000 people have also proposed wage increases, and if rejected, it may also lead to strikes.

### The US Proposes a New Treaty on Defending the Panama Canal to Panama; the US Plans to Continue to Use Bases in Panama

[Our Own Correspondent] San Francisco, 6th Dispatch: Regarding the new treaty on defending the Panama Canal, the United States has proposed to the Panamanian authorities that the new treaty stipulates that the US will continue to use military bases within the Republic of Panama. During the war, Panama provided 134 bases for the US military to use to defend the Panama Canal. After the war, 98 bases have been returned to the Panamanian authorities, and the remaining 36 bases are still used by the US military for air transport and shipping safety.

### French Cabinet Meeting Discusses the Situation in Madagascar

[Associated Press, Paris, 5th Dispatch] The French cabinet after the withdrawal of the Communist Party held its first meeting today to discuss the rebellion in Madagascar, East Africa. Acting Minister of National Defense Telbos reported that the rebellion has been brought under control, but has not yet been quelled. It was immediately decided to send infantry and air force to the island for reinforcement.

Fierce Fighting

[Associated Press, Paris, 6th Dispatch] Paris received news today that French troops and rebels are fighting in Madagascar, an island in the Indian Ocean, for more than a month. In recent days, a large-scale military operation has been launched. One hundred and fifty rebel natives have been killed, and more than one hundred have been injured. The fighting is fierce along the east coast of Madagascar and in the mountains south of Tananarive. French paratroopers are engaged in combat. The natives of Madagascar seem to be aiming at cutting off the French army's transportation lines.

### There Are Signs of Peace Talks Between France and Vietnam; the French Side in Saigon Denies Calling for Peace

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 5th Dispatch] It is rumored that the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Bollaert, has begun to call on both sides to resolve the conflict between France and Vietnam peacefully. This statement has been denied by responsible persons here.

[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] The French government and the Viet Minh government may begin negotiations sometime this week to end the war. A dispatch from our Saigon office revealed that the conflict in Vietnam is expected to end soon so that negotiations to resolve the dispute can be conducted in a peaceful atmosphere; a dispatch from our Paris office also said that the French government is considering the conditions for resolving the situation in Vietnam. According to reliable sources in Paris, the Viet Minh government has tentatively explored peace with the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Bollaert, in a semi-official manner. The French government is considering the conditions for establishing a solution, and today's cabinet meeting discussed this matter. At the same time, Saigon sources said that negotiations between the French government and representatives of Ho Chi Minh's government could be held near Hanoi before the weekend, and the basis for the negotiations is still being kept secret. The sudden change in the situation in Vietnam is thought to be the result of French Army Minister Florey and Navy Minister Shekino's inspection of the military situation in northern Vietnam.

### British Paratroopers Search for Fugitives in the Holy City

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 5th Dispatch] After the prison break in Acre yesterday, British paratroopers continued to surround the Jewish areas near the city today. Criminal police from the police headquarters conducted a thorough investigation of all Jewish men. Officials announced that a total of 316 prisoners escaped, including 33 Jews and 183 Arabs. Twenty-nine Jewish prisoners who are still at large are convicted terrorists, and several Arab prisoners have surrendered.

### Eradicating Criminal Tendencies by Cutting the Prefrontal Lobe

A Major Achievement in Surgery

[United Press, Pittsburgh, 5th Dispatch] It was learned today that the work of removing human criminal tendencies by brain surgery has now been implemented, which is a major achievement in surgery. A person named Ryder, who is accustomed to theft, is 38 years old and has a long history of criminal cases dating back to 1928. According to criminal law, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment, so he asked the Allegheny County Court for permission to voluntarily accept prefrontal lobotomy experiments. In the operating room, Dr. Koskoff performed the surgery for three hours, with a court behavioral psychiatrist monitoring it. The prefrontal lobe was separated from the rest of the brain. Today, he is radiant and healthy as usual. This type of surgery is not uncommon and has been performed repeatedly in new psychiatric institutions with considerable success. However, Ryder's case is the first to be requested by a criminal. Whether Ryder can abandon darkness and turn to the light from now on remains to be proven by future behavior.

### The US Will Hold Trade Week to Seek to Expand Import Trade

[United Press, Washington, 5th Dispatch] The United States will celebrate "World Trade Week" from May 18 to 24, with the purpose of expanding import trade, rather than increasing export trade, which has been the main goal of the United States' traditional trade policy. According to the most favorable forecast currently, the export of US goods may reach 11 billion US dollars in 1947, but the estimate of imported goods rarely exceeds 6 billion US dollars, which has surprised the most outstanding economists in the United States and other countries in the world. How to make up for this gap? If a remedy cannot be found, there is a risk that the situation that caused the serious global economic depression in 1929 will reappear.

### Japanese Cabinet Ministers Submitted Resignations Yesterday; the Date of the Cabinet's Resignation Will Be Determined by the Prime Minister

[United Press, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] The Japanese government was ordered by the Emperor on the 6th to formally convene the new parliament on May 28. Some observers believe that after the Emperor designates the date of the new parliament's convening, the cabinet may resign today.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] The regular cabinet meeting of the Japanese government was still held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 6th. Prime Minister Yoshida did not attend due to illness. The meeting first resolved to convene the Diet on May 20, and then discussed the procedures for the general resignation. At this time, Cabinet Secretary-General Hayashi explained the attitude of the Yoshida cabinet regarding the general election, and then collected the resignations of the cabinet ministers, which were sent to the Foreign Minister's official residence by Sato, the Director of the Cabinet Affairs Division, and handed over to Prime Minister Yoshida. It is reported that Cabinet Secretary-General Hayashi and Cabinet Legislation Bureau Director-General Irie Shunro have also submitted their resignations to the cabinet.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] Because the negotiations on the next regime have not yet matured, according to Article 70 of the new constitution, the issue of the date of the cabinet's general resignation is likely to be postponed to the date of the new Diet's convening on the 20th. Therefore, in this cabinet meeting, it was decided to leave the date of the general resignation to the Prime Minister to handle. It is said that the cabinet ministers who have submitted their resignations will still decide on their resignation date according to the Prime Minister's wishes.

### Seoul-Busan Railway Runs Streamlined Train

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] Korea's newest streamlined train, the "Korean Liberator," made its maiden voyage on the Seoul-Busan railway yesterday.

### Marshall and Members of Congress Confer on Implementing Broadcasting Plan; House Appropriations Committee Advocates Cancellation

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall, Acting Secretary of State Axson, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, and important members of Congress held a meeting last night that lasted two hours to discuss the continuation of shortwave broadcasting to foreign countries. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain an appropriation of $31 million to carry out this shortwave propaganda plan. Congress hopes to cancel this. Marshall and Axson repeatedly stated at the meeting that the world is currently being poisoned by lies and propaganda, so people must be brought closer to the truth. The State Department spokesman declined to comment on the attitude of members of Congress after the meeting.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th Dispatch] The House Appropriations Committee today passed the subcommittee's recommendation to cancel the "Voice of America" broadcasting plan to the Soviet Union. Although Secretary of State Marshall said that he had asked congressional leaders to maintain this broadcasting plan, it was still ineffective. In addition, the Russian-language "America" magazine issued in the Soviet Union will also be discontinued.

[United Press, Washington, 5th Dispatch] House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber said today that the committee intends to adhere to its decision to cancel the State Department's "Voice of America" broadcast program to the Soviet Union and other broadcast programs to Europe and Asia after holding a joint meeting with Secretary of State Marshall from the government, industry, and Congress. According to current indications, Marshall will likely devote all his efforts to the debate in the Senate, as the Senate is usually easier to approve government funding than the House. Earlier, Marshall had summoned US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith back to the United States to hold a meeting with key congressional leaders to avoid Congress cutting funding and continuing to maintain the broadcasting program. Smith, who was first called back to the country on the 3rd, was the first to advocate that the State Department broadcast to the Soviet Union in Russian. Smith told about 25 senators and representatives who attended the meeting that many Soviet people had privately told him that the "Voice of America" had made a deep impression on them. According to his estimate, the Soviet Union will have 7.5 million shortwave radios in 1950. He also believes that this program is sufficient to overturn Soviet communist propaganda that accuses the United States of being militaristic and imperialistic.

### The Emperor of Japan Visits MacArthur

[United Press, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] Emperor Hirohito, accompanied by Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, a chamberlain, and three interpreters, went to the US Embassy at 10:15 this morning to visit MacArthur and talked for an hour before leaving. This is Hirohito's fourth meeting with MacArthur since Japan's surrender, and it is also Hirohito's first meeting with MacArthur since the implementation of the new constitution on May 3, after all political privileges were stripped. According to MacArthur's spokesman, the two only discussed "routine business." However, it is generally believed that Hirohito's visit to MacArthur after his political privileges were stripped must be a mutual congratulation on Japan's entry into this new era. At the same time, the political situation after the parliamentary election is very chaotic. It is rumored among the Japanese that the Allied Headquarters may come forward to mediate so that a coalition cabinet can be established.

### Illegal Bombing by Japanese Aircraft; War Criminals Still Try to Defend the Generals

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th, United Press Dispatch] The Tokyo International War Crimes Tribunal continued its trial today, with defense lawyers trying to absolve the Japanese Air Force of charges of illegal bombing during the so-called "China Incident." Rear Admiral Nemoto of the former Ministry of the Navy testified that the Japanese Air Force did pay attention to international air force practices and rules; he also said that although the various rules passed by the Hague Conference had not been ratified, Japan did comply with these rules during its operations in China. He also presented a document showing which targets should be bombed and which targets should be avoided. He pointed out that churches, crosses, shrines, libraries, and places unrelated to military affairs were not to be bombed. Nemoto also said that the authorities would order the Japanese Air Force to be "extremely cautious" when bombing to prevent damage to the property of third countries or their citizens. Finally, he said that deliberately bombing civilians to achieve threatening purposes was not allowed.

### The Last Batch of Japanese People From Taiwan Arrives in Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] The last batch of 2,200 Japanese people sent back from Taiwan arrived here yesterday aboard the Tainan. When the Tainan returns to Taiwan, it will carry about 100 Taiwanese people, mostly unemployed. In total, 477,000 Japanese people have been sent back to Japan from Taiwan.

### Indian Racial Strife; Gandhi Blames Britain; Says British Troops Should Withdraw From India as Soon as Possible

[Reuters, New Delhi, 5th Dispatch] Gandhi met with our reporter in Delhi today and gave a 40-minute speech. He said that although Britain's decision to withdraw from India in June next year is commendable, wouldn't it be better if Britain could withdraw immediately? Gandhi sat cross-legged. Before the reporter visited, he had continuously met with Nehru and many others, but he still showed no signs of fatigue. The reporter asked whether Britain had a moral obligation to continue to stay in India if the dispute in India had not been resolved by June 1948? Gandhi replied: It would be a good thing if Britain could withdraw immediately. Waiting another 13 months would be a disaster for India. I do not doubt the value of the British Cabinet's declaration or the sincerity of the Governor-General, but the facts are still the facts and cannot be changed by the British Cabinet or the Governor-General.

### The Oldest Human Bones in Europe Discovered

[Agence France-Presse, Hamburg, Germany, 5th Dispatch] It is reported that the bones of ancient Europeans have been discovered in the Ronaberg area, dating back to before the time of the Great Flood, which is a new discovery of human remains.

### Mountbatten's Report Suggested That India Be Divided; Some Military Experts Oppose

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th Dispatch] Regarding the report submitted by Governor-General Mountbatten to the British Cabinet through his advisor Ismay, political figures said that the report does not contain any specific solutions to India's current difficult situation, but includes several solutions, one of which can be chosen. One of them is to divide India into Pakistan, Hindustan, and several autonomous states of princes. These solutions will be presented to Indian leaders separately, or at a round table conference. In addition, according to some military experts, if Muslims establish Pakistan in the northwestern border area of India, India's national defense will be extremely difficult. The British government should accept the proposal of the cabinet delegation, that is, grant the Muslim League all possible rights, but maintain the unity of India in terms of diplomacy and transportation.

A Reliance Mentality Is Shameful

Today's India has been trained to rely solely on British power. This mentality will not be easy to change in a short time. In the next 13 months, all aspects of India should follow the lead of the British Cabinet and the Governor-General. Today, everyone hopes for the assistance of British military power, which is a shameful phenomenon. India does not have a system of self-government, only a system of forced acceptance by the people, so once Britain withdraws, India will inevitably fall into chaos. I believe that India's racial strife is the result of the British presence in India. If the British were not in India, we would inevitably have battles, but these battles would have allowed us to clarify ourselves. The reporter then asked what the relationship between Britain and India would be after Britain withdrew from India? He replied: If Britain can withdraw completely in good faith, Britain and India will be able to maintain the most friendly relationship.

The World Is Trending Towards Another Duel

Q: Can the United Nations maintain lasting peace? A: No one can deny that the world is trending towards another duel, but if everything in India progresses smoothly, the world will be able to have lasting peace.

### Stettinius Comments on the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act; Believes This Is a Negative Approach

[United Press, Washington, 5th Dispatch] Stettinius, a Republican presidential candidate for 1948, criticized President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey plan as a "negative" approach at a press conference today, and said that the United States should take a "positive and constructive path." We should not use money, arms, and technology to promote a full-scale military offensive against the Communist-led guerrillas in Greece, but should rely on economic plans to bring prosperity and thereby win the hearts of the people. I support the Senate's approval of the $400 million amendment to the aid to Greece and Turkey bill simply because I believe that "this is a bipartisan foreign policy issue." However, the only way to stop the internal division of Greece is to establish an effective economic system in the areas controlled by the current government, promote prosperity, and attract those who form factions to resist the government to return.

### The Index Will Decide to Unfreeze Wages This Month; Calculations Will Be Divided Into Eight Levels; Officials Reveal That the Current Index Is Approximately 15,000 Times

[Our Own Correspondent] Reliable sources said that the plan for unfreezing the cost of living index that Minister Gu Zhengcheng of the Ministry of Social Affairs negotiated with various parties in Shanghai this time is as follows: for wages below 30 yuan, all will be calculated according to the index; for those from 30 yuan to 40 yuan, a 5% discount will be applied; for those from 40 yuan to 50 yuan, another 5% discount will be added; and so on. As for the current index, although the government has not announced it, government officials revealed that it is about 15,000 times. The reporter asked both labor and management for their opinions on this plan, and the responses received were as follows: the labor side believes that a dan of white rice in January was only 100,000 yuan, and the current selling price is 300,000 yuan. The price increase of other commodities is also more than double. It is hoped that the calculation of the index can be consistent with the actual situation. Management believes that the base salary of most workers is currently between 30 yuan and 50 yuan. According to this plan, it is equivalent to no discount. The index has been frozen for four months, and once it is suddenly unfrozen, some factories are afraid that they will not be able to bear it. As for the price of factory products, it has indeed risen by more than double, and in principle, they should be able to bear it; however, the price of raw materials has risen by more than ten times, so as far as factories are concerned, there are also practical difficulties.

[Another Dispatch] The central government has decided to unfreeze the cost of living index and has internally decided on four measures: (1) All industrial workers in each factory with wages below 30 yuan will be calculated according to the cost of living index. (2) Those with more than 30 yuan will be discounted level by level, divided into the following eight levels: 1. 31 yuan to 45 yuan, 2. 46 yuan to 60 yuan, 3. 61 yuan to 90 yuan, 4. 91 yuan to 120 yuan, 5. 121 yuan to 150 yuan, 6. 151 yuan to 180 yuan, 7. 181 yuan to 210 yuan, 8. 211 yuan and above. Each of the above eight levels will be discounted, and the higher the level, the smaller the discount, but the difference in the discount is not very large. (3) After the index is unfrozen, if the employer is indeed unable to bear it, the labor and management can negotiate separately and re-establish the standard for issuing wages, and report it to the competent authorities for record. (4) The implementation date of this measure will begin this month. (That is, the index must be unfrozen this month). The above four measures will be implemented after the highest authorities make a final approval, so the unfreezing of the cost of living index can be realized within this month.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The competent authorities have decided on the principle of unfreezing the cost of living index.

When reporters asked about the recent situation of the conflict between the Dutch East Indies Independence Party and the Dutch government, it was stated that there were no so-called wars between the two, only disturbances and conflicts, which are still being negotiated by both sides.

When asked about his opinion on the Messber case, the ambassador said that he had no special opinion. He has confidence in the Chinese judiciary and believes that this case will be judged fairly by the Chinese judicial authorities. The ambassador also mentioned the general situation in the Netherlands after the war, saying that everything in the Netherlands has gradually returned to normal, quite rapidly. Young people are very interested in industry. However, there is a shortage of food, and the rationing system is still in place.

The ambassador will stay in Shanghai for a week and then return to Beijing.

### Pan Da Appeals Death Sentence; Vehemently Denies Presiding Over Assassinations; Provides Detailed Information on the Organization of "76"

[Report from Our Newspaper] Pan Da was charged with suspicion of being a traitor. The High Court sentenced him to death on August 19 last year. Pan refused to accept the sentence and applied to the Supreme Court for review. The Supreme Court instructed the original trial to conduct a detailed investigation on the so-called "Shanghai Evil Bully" and the creation of terrorist incidents in Shanghai, and whether the defendant had the right to directly direct this action, especially whether there was solid evidence to convince the defendant. The original judgment was revoked and returned for retrial. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday. Pan wore a gray striped suit and tea crystal glasses when he appeared in court, and his attitude was quite calm. He vehemently denied the accusations in the indictment that he had presided over the assassination incidents in Shanghai, saying that the assassinations of Wu Gengshu and Xu Tianmin of the Hollywood Casino were committed by Qian Renlong, the deputy director of the Pseudo Fourth Division. The terrorist acts in the Shanghai Concession during the period of the fall were directly directed by Ding Mocun and Li Shiqun, and he described in detail the organizational situation in "76", saying that it was divided into four divisions, three offices, four groups, and two teams. The functions of the four divisions were: the first division was in charge of general affairs, the second division was in charge of intelligence and trials, the third division was in charge of telecommunications, and the fourth division was in charge of foreign affairs. He had served as the director of the fourth division, and his work was to contact police officers in the concession and negotiate with the concession authorities on the establishment of a pseudo special police station in the cross-border road construction. After repeated questioning by Judge Xiao, the trial lasted for an hour, and it was announced that the trial would be adjourned to a later date because further investigation was needed.

### Xu Jidun Applies for Review; Obvious Evidence of Crimes Rejected

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Jidun was suspected of being a traitor, and the High Court sentenced him to ten years of imprisonment, ten years of deprivation of civil rights, and confiscation of his property in accordance with the law. Xu refused to accept the sentence and applied to the Supreme Court for review. The Supreme Court has now issued a special judgment No. 927, "The original judgment is approved." The reasons are briefly as follows: "The defendant served as the director of the General Education Department of the Pseudo Ministry of Education in April of the 29th year, increasing the Japanese language course. In September of the same year, he was transferred to the Pseudo Zhejiang Provincial Education Department. In the 34th year, he was transferred to the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Utility Bureau, and then changed to the Construction Bureau, and he continued to be re-elected, assuming actual responsibility, and his crimes of colluding with the enemy are obvious. The original trial sentenced the defendant to ten years of imprisonment because he surrendered himself, which is not inappropriate. The evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to be adopted, so the original judgment is approved, and the defendant's application is rejected."

### Police Bureau Announces Details of Student-Police Conflict

On "May Fourth" at Noon, Shanghai Law School Students Had a Conflict with Police Due to Posting Slogans

The police bureau spokesman announced the handling of the case as follows:

On "May Fourth" at noon, Li Shuxi, Lin Ziqiu, Pan Sicai, and Gu Qianji, students of the Law School, pasted slogans on the glass windows of the Free Press on Shanyin Road. Police officer No. 6163 Guo Jiaxiang was ordered to ban it and politely dissuaded them, but to no avail. Before long, two trucks loaded with about 200 students surrounded Officer Guo, and a conflict immediately broke out. Officer Guo fled to the desk in the Free Press, but the students still chased and beat him, causing Officer Guo to be seriously injured. Later, Zhao, a staff member of the North Sichuan Road Branch, received the news and rescued him, and rushed the police officer to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, students Li Shuxi and others claimed to have been beaten by Officer Guo. The police bureau believed that the fact that Officer Guo was beaten and injured was clear, and the right and wrong had been clarified. However, considering that these students were all young people, or were reckless for a while, the police handed over the students who committed the crime to Chu Fengyi, the president of the Law School, to take back. However, since the case involved injury, the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with the law.

According to the police bureau spokesman, "On the morning of 'May Fourth' at 7:30, Zhu Huiliang and other students of Guanghua University pasted slogans opposing the government's policies in the area of Haining Road on North Sichuan Road. The branch in charge ordered the shops to scrub them off and seized 140 of these slogans. Yesterday at noon, ten student representatives from Guanghua University went to the general bureau to request an explanation. After being dispatched to explain the handling process, the representatives expressed their satisfaction and left the bureau.

### Relatives of Victims of the Zhongya Ship Disaster Request Auction of Motor Sailboat

Gather at the Maritime Administration Bureau; A Dispute

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhongya ship of the Zhongya Shipping Company was burned on the Yangtze River Zhangjiazhou River in early March of this year. More than 100 crew members and passengers were killed. The company only had this one ship, and it was unable to handle it after the accident, so it closed down, so that the families of the victims had no way to obtain compensation. Later, it was learned that the owner of the company, Jin Fuya, had another motor sailboat named Jinya. The relatives of the victims detained it, intending to auction it off and use the proceeds as compensation. At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, male and female family members of the crew members went to the Maritime Administration Bureau to request recognition of the auction. The bureau was located on the second floor of the China Merchants Bureau on Guangdong Road Bund. At that time, there were twenty or thirty people, who rushed upstairs. The guard saw this and tried to stop them, causing a conflict. Fortunately, Zhu caused the disaster. Then the family members mistakenly believed that it was ordered by the Maritime Administration Bureau, so they negotiated with the bureau. After persuasion, they dispersed. The transfer of the motor sailboat has also been approved, and a disturbance has subsided.

### Four District Administrative Symposiums; Thugs Snatching Goods, Pushing Carts for Extortion; Bad Phenomena to Be Improved

[Report from Our Newspaper] Municipal Councilor Pan convened the chiefs and deputy chiefs of Hongkou, Zhabei, North Station, and North Siping Road districts and the chairmen of the district people's congresses yesterday morning to hold a district administrative symposium. In addition to general issues such as funding, awareness, shantytowns, and garbage, the representatives also raised several issues that they hoped to improve: (1) North Tibet Road and Anqing Road are important transportation hubs. It is hoped that the Municipal Public Works Bureau will repair them as soon as possible, and the North Zhejiang Road Bridge will be opened. (2) Organized thugs specialize in snatching goods from trucks and vans. When rickshaws and tricycles go up and down the bridge, a large number of street children use pushing the cart as a pretext to extort in every possible way, which is very annoying to passengers. On both sides of the road, refugees eat in the wind and sleep in the open. All these phenomena affect order and appearance, but the police turn a blind eye, and the competent authorities do not try to accommodate them. This problem is really worth paying attention to. (3) It is hoped that the district chief and the autonomous personnel below the district will increase their salaries and implement year-end bonuses. (4) It is hoped that one household registration cadre will be assigned to each Bao, and Bao Ding will be restored.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the handling of enemy and pseudo real estate in Shanghai, the Central Trust Bureau is scheduled to start re-evaluating in two weeks, and at the same time register tenants, and then sell by tender.

### Cracking Down on Counterfeit Japanese Medicine; Principal Offenders Captured; Fake Medicine Worth 500 Million; Haining Pharmacy Investigated for Purchase

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chief Kuai of the North Sichuan Road Police Branch received a book report at about 4:00 p.m. one day, saying that someone was counterfeiting Japanese Western medicine in No. 83, Lane 50, Kulun Road. Deputy Branch Chief Wang Jianxin was ordered to go to the address with Criminal Section Chief Wu Zhenxiong and staff member Cai Yanzuo to search.

All the decorations, boxes, trademarks, and medicine bottles were almost genuine. The principal offenders, husband and wife, were taken to the bureau for interrogation along with the fake drugs. According to the confession: Song Hanzhong, 29 years old, from Haimen, engaged in business. His wife, Guan Jizhen, was of the same age and from the same hometown. They admitted to manufacturing fake drugs and selling them under false pretenses. All duties such as purchasing raw materials, manufacturing, and selling were performed by their accomplice Chen Jinrong. His nephew Xiao Gen was responsible for washing bottles and other chores. Song was only responsible for packaging and other matters. Last month, Song had manufactured two kinds of Wanyou and Jiesiji Er by himself, but all the medicine bottles and signs were also handled by Chen Jinrong. In addition to the 50 boxes of Wanyou potion that Chen had sold, the Jiesiji Er he made was sold to Haining Pharmacy at No. 233 Haining Road last month. A police officer was sent to the store under the guise of buying various brands of Japanese medicine. As a result, four boxes of Xinhua Linzong and Wanli Airilisheng and two boxes of Jiesihai Er were found in the store. The owner, Yu Jixiang, was summoned to the bureau. It was learned that he and Song had worked together at Bailing Pharmacy on Dazha Road before the war. Recently, Song brought Jiesiji Er to the store for sale. Because they were in the same industry, he did not suspect anything else. The rest of the drugs were bought from customs auctions. After questioning Song Guan Jizhen, they denied participating in the work. The case has been investigated, and all the defendants will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial today. According to the police officer in charge of the case, if all the fake drugs seized are sold, it is estimated that they can earn about 500 million yuan.

### Two Cases of Rice Hoarding Transferred to Court; Commander Xuan Speaks on Hiding Rice and Refusing to Sell; Decides to Order Military and Police to Investigate and Handle Strictly

The Economic Section of the Police Bureau recently received a tip that Fu Xing Gong Rice Store at No. 269 Dajing Road in the Southern District was refusing to sell rice sold by the Social Bureau and hiding it in the stack of Dazhong Oil Shop at No. 263 next door, while selling it at black market prices. They immediately sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and found that the store still had twelve shi of white japonica rice (not rice sold by the Social Bureau), fourteen shi of Saigon rice, and four shi of Baiyuan rice, all of which they refused to sell. When questioned, the store owner Yan Jiasheng claimed that the store had been taking orders from various customers since last year, and about fifty shi had not yet been delivered, so the stored rice was prepared for customers to pick up. Police officers ordered Yan Jia[sheng] to sign a guarantee.

Continuing to Dazhong Oil Shop, they found 50 shi of rice inside. According to the shop owner Gu Zhongshan, some of the rice was purchased and stored by Tian Fu Xing Gong Rice Store, and the other part was sent by Ma Qiao Yongfeng Flower Factory for storage, but there was no evidence. Gu Zhongshan was also ordered to sign a guarantee. The Police Bureau reported this case to Commander Xuan for handling. Yesterday, the order was received: "Immediately arrest the persons in charge of each store and send them to the court for investigation."

Yesterday evening, Commander Xuan made a statement, saying: The Municipal Government has a definite source for the city's food supply and will implement rationing for public school teachers, schools, factories, and civilians.

If rice merchants arbitrarily raise market prices or hide rice and refuse to sell it during this period, creating artificial panic, the military and police will be ordered to strictly investigate and handle it. If unscrupulous elements lurking in the city secretly incite the masses, stir up trouble, and disrupt public order, they will also be severely punished. It is hoped that the government and the people will work together to ensure the peace of this city.

[Reported by this newspaper] During the city's occupation, the Rice High Beauty Dance Hall on Xizang Road was actually a major base for our underground workers, assisting our military intelligence agents in disguising themselves as porters and dancing girls to gather information on the enemy and puppet troops.

He added that if, in addition to entertainment, people could be frugal and help the poor, wouldn't that be even more beautiful?

### Social Services; Reader Consultation

Legal Questions

(1) Cuckoo Occupying the Nest

Wu Zhiping asks: A relative, Mr. A, has a shop that he produced himself. In 1936, it was rented to Mr. B. There was no lease agreement, and no witnesses. Both parties stated that Mr. A could take it back at any time if he wanted to use it himself. In 1941, Mr. A passed away, and the rent was collected by his wife, Mrs. C. In 1943, Mr. A's son (Mr. D) came of age and wanted to take it back for his own use. He notified Mr. B and asked him to move out within three months. Mr. B agreed. After three months, Mr. B said it was difficult to find a house, so Mrs. C agreed to extend the deadline by three months. After another three months, Mrs. C asked Mr. B to move out again, but Mr. B broke his promise and insisted on staying. Therefore, Mrs. C has refused to accept rent since the autumn of 1943, which is now three years. Questions: (1) Since Mrs. C's shop is indeed for her own use, can she take it back? (2) Since she has not collected rent for three years, can Mrs. C sue Mr. B for forcible occupation? (3) Since Mrs. C has considerable proof that she wants to take it back for her own use, can she make Mr. B move out?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) If Mrs. C's shop is indeed for her own use, she can take it back from Mr. B in accordance with Article 100, Paragraph 1 of the Land Law. (2) Not collecting rent for three years is different from owing rent. Before the lease agreement between the two parties is legally terminated, there is no issue of forcible occupation. Mrs. C cannot sue Mr. B for forcibly occupying the house. (3) Since Mrs. C has considerable proof that she wants to take it back for her own use, she can sue in court, requesting a judgment ordering Mr. B to move out.

(2) Debt Litigation

Ding Quan asks: (1) The law stipulates that the right to sue is for fifteen years, but should the eight years of the war be deducted from the calculation? Also, if one defendant is in the interior and the other is in the occupied area, how should the lawsuit be handled? (2) After ten years have passed since the pre-war debt, can a request be made to increase it by a certain amount? (3) Now that the defendant is in Shanghai and the plaintiff is in Changzhou, can the lawsuit be filed in Changzhou?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) If the period for exercising rights stipulated in the Civil Code or other laws could not be observed due to the war, the rights can still be exercised within two years after the implementation of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation after Recovery (this regulation was implemented on February 18, 1945). However, if the original period is shorter than two years, the rights can only be exercised within six months after the implementation of the regulation (see Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation after Recovery). (2) According to the law, it is indeed possible to request the court to increase the payment of pre-war debts, but the standard for increasing the payment should be fairly determined by the court. (3) Article 24 of the Civil Procedure Law stipulates that "the parties may agree on a court of first instance, but only for lawsuits arising from a certain legal relationship," and "the aforementioned agreement must be evidenced in writing."

### In the Great Era of the End of the Eight-Year War of Resistance, How to Be a Nation-Building Youth (Continued from the 5th)

— Zhou Jixi

Training in Scientific Knowledge

Third, to be a nation-building youth, we must have scientific knowledge. The world today is a scientific world. The power of science is enough to determine everything in the world. The Second World War, which raged across the globe, was due to Germany's scientific weapons, such as seventy-ton tanks and magnetic mines, which highlighted Hitler's ferocity and once dominated Europe for a time. If Britain had not had new anti-tank guns and the invention of depth charges and magnetic mine destroyers at the time, could it have turned danger into safety and defeat into victory? Until August of the previous year, when the two atomic bombs invented by the United States first showed their power in Japan, they forced millions of Japanese imperial troops, who had been rampaging in East Asia, to submit. The Japanese Emperor, trembling, led tens of millions of his subjects to declare unconditional surrender to us, thus ending the nearly ten-year bloody war that had swept the globe. Is this not the power of science, the decisive battle of science? Therefore, to build a strong country and survive in this scientific world, we must develop science. To develop our country's science, our country must have thousands of times more scientific workers than it currently has; and most of their work must be world-class. When there are so many scientific workers and such good results, and when scientific methods can be widely applied to solve various life problems, then science can take root and live in China. Only when this level is achieved can our economy, our politics, and our society have a solid foundation. Young friends, whether we are willing to do practical or theoretical work, there are countless interesting and important problems in science, from mathematics to biology, waiting for us to solve. Young friends who love science, for the sake of nation-building, we must bring science deep into the countryside and the border areas, and sow the seeds of science in poor and remote areas, in the vast border areas, and in the eyes and hearts of our 470 million compatriots, so that from the Heilongjiang River in the northeast to the foothills of the Himalayas in the southwest, and throughout the Chinese society, the economy, and the politics, are filled with the seeds of science, sprouting new shoots of science, blooming with the flowers of science, and bearing the fruits of science. Young friends who love science, let us mobilize together, devote ourselves to scientific research, engage in scientific construction, and build a scientific, modern, new China.

Cultivating a Democratic Spirit

Fourth, to be a nation-building youth, we must have democratic cultivation. The important meaning of democracy is to be law-abiding and to obey the public will of the majority and to abide by the laws and regulations of the state and society. The general public in our country can be said to lack democratic cultivation. Therefore, in everything, they often fail to obey the public will and abide by the laws and regulations, resulting in chaos throughout the country and society. As we approach the eve of constitutional government, we must naturally move towards the road of democracy and pay attention to democratic cultivation. Young students are the vanguard of the people and the elite of the nation, so their every word and deed should be a model for the general public, and they should pay special attention to democratic cultivation, leading the general public towards the open road of democratic constitutionalism. There are indeed many young students who can do this, but there are also not a few who lack democratic cultivation and, under the guise of democracy and freedom, do things that violate the law and disrupt discipline. Recently, it has been heard from time to time that young students in various places have stirred up troubles due to minor matters, attacked newspaper offices and shops, and even used strikes as a weapon. This is completely contrary to democracy. Because democracy is about obeying the public will and respecting public opinion; newspapers are originally the mouthpiece of the people, speaking for the people, so how can newspaper offices be destroyed? Is this not a barbaric act of destroying public opinion and betraying democracy? As for minor matters that occur within the school, they can be resolved through legal means and judged by public opinion and reason. Why is it necessary to incite unrest and even strikes? Young students have a duty to study, and parents and the country expect them to succeed in their studies and benefit the country and society, so they spare no expense to run schools every year. Now, to strike over minor matters is to deceive oneself and others, to harm oneself and the country, to abandon one's studies, and to destroy the country's future? Young students, for the sake of protecting your studies and cherishing the country's future, you must not engage in suicidal acts such as strikes again. On the contrary, you must use legal procedures, express the public will, and use the sanctions of public opinion: in a negative sense, eliminate the troublemakers and lawbreakers who harm the group within the school; in a positive sense, organize various academic research associations and engage in various group activities in a law-abiding manner to cultivate a democratic spirit, promote democratic cultivation, and then guide the public to practice local self-government, prepare for the implementation of constitutional government, and build a new China with democratic constitutionalism.

Young friends, we are living in this great era of nation-building, which comes once in a thousand years, and we should shoulder the historical mission of nation-building, forge a strong physique, cultivate a noble personality, train good scientific knowledge, and possess democratic cultivation. Then, with the spirit of "establishing oneself and establishing others, achieving oneself and achieving others," we can build a strong and democratic modern new Republic of China. (Written in Shanghai on May 4, 1947)

Last night, it easily defeated Jiaotong University 7-0, showing its prowess. In the second division, the Zhejiang Xing Team played against Post Office Three in the Post Office Ballroom. The three musketeers of Zhejiang Xing, Zhu Xuejing, Xie Pancai, and Chen Honggao, each made great contributions. From the fourth group onwards, the Post Office Three generals did not lose heart and won three consecutive cities, tying the score. In the final group, Zhejiang Xing's strong player Luo Yaonan was absent and had no substitute to replace him, resulting in forfeiture and a loss to Post Office Three. Tonight from 8:00 PM, there will be eight more groups competing, with the fourth division's China United Women's Team making its debut, facing the new army Spinning Mill Four. The former has older qualifications and experience. If Spinning Mill Four does not work hard, it may suffer at the hands of the female generals.

### Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee Discusses Import-Export Linkage System

Representatives nominated by the Export and Import Associations to study and submit opinions to the National Economic Commission for reference

[Our Report] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held its ninth consecutive meeting on May 3rd, 5th, and 6th. Chairman Zhang Jia'ao introduced Vice Chairman Chen Guangfu. Attendees also included committee members Liu Gongyun, Jin Shixuan, Ren Sida, Shen Xirui, consultants Li Rui, McGrath, Payne, Chen Junren, director of the Shenyang office, Mai Zuoheng, director of the Guangzhou office, secretaries Fang Shangui, Zhang Xu, and Shao Zhenhua of the National Bank Business Bureau, and many others. In addition to the policy responses to the South China smuggling problem, the import methods for materials required for the manufacture of export goods, and the export principles for soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, and oil extraction, which have been reported in the previous yesterday's newspapers, several other motions were discussed: (1) Regarding the adjustment of import and export trade methods discussed by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, after detailed consideration, for the sake of caution regarding the import-export linkage system, it was decided that the Export and Import Associations should each nominate three representatives to thoroughly study the information provided by all parties, formulate opinions, and submit them to the National Economic Commission for reference. (2) Regarding the barter trade between China and India, it was considered that it should be promoted urgently. It was recommended that the Central Trust Bureau represent the government to negotiate and handle it.

### Rice Boats Detained, Scarcity of Goods Arriving; Grain Merchants Ask Mayor for Protection; White Rice Retail Price Exceeds 300,000 Yuan Mark

[Our Report] The rice rush spread from Hangzhou to Wuxi, and rice merchants were afraid of their rice being robbed, so they mostly hesitated to move forward. Local governments along the way also made things difficult for rice merchants from Shanghai who went to the production areas to transport rice. Ten rice boats destined for Shanghai were detained between Qingpu and Huangdu a few days ago.

Shanghai rice merchants, concerned that the detention of rice would affect transportation and the overall food supply for the city, sent Qu Zhenhua, Cha Baosan, and Xu Songren to visit Mayor Wu yesterday morning to ask him to find a way to solve this difficulty. Mayor Wu promised to immediately telegraph the garrison headquarters to send personnel to protect the rice merchants in the production areas and to ask the local authorities not to make things difficult for them. They also telegraphed to request the release of the ten detained rice boats.

White Rice Creates New Record

The amount of goods arriving at the North and South markets yesterday was still scarce, totaling 668.6 dan. Because the market has resumed free trading and river goods have also joined the trade, the actual transaction volume was more than 5,000 dan. The asking price for white rice was 270,000 yuan for the Chang Gang and 300,000 yuan for the Xi Gang. The retail price was even higher than this, all setting new records.

The Social Affairs Bureau still sold 9,000 bags of white rice yesterday. The South Market sold 4,500 bags, and the North Market only purchased 4,320 bags. Another 180 bags were not purchased. In the past, because of the small amount of allocated rice, many citizens lined up to buy it, which often caused disputes, so they were afraid to register. The rice shops now plan to concentrate the allocated rice for each district in one place for sale and send personnel from each rice shop to jointly assist in handling it.

Rice to Be Rationed to Workers and Students

Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has soared and it is not easy to buy. In order to stabilize the food supply, the Social Affairs Bureau has reportedly formulated temporary emergency measures to implement rice rationing. According to reporters, the measures stipulate that factory workers, public and private university students, and secondary school students will have their names and national ID numbers submitted by the factories and schools to the bureau for verification and allocation of two dou of rice per person per month. In poor areas, the bureau will set up public rice sales offices for the poor in conjunction with the district police stations and district offices. Poor people in each district can purchase rice from the public sales office with their household registration certificates and all ID cards of the household. It is reported that the temporary emergency measures are being submitted to the central government for approval and are expected to be implemented in a short period of time.

Large Batch of Foreign Rice to Arrive Within Days

The foreign rice ordered by the China Trust Bureau continues to arrive. On the 5th, 2,000 tons of Siamese rice were transported by the Hai Xia ship. Another 6,800 tons of Siamese rice were loaded by the Yangon Chongxing ship on the 3rd and will arrive within days.

### Rising Prices of Flour and Grains

[Report from Our Newspaper] Edible oil prices rose and then fell yesterday, with closing prices for all vendors ending up about 10,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Our factory's soybean oil was 590,000 yuan, common barrel cooked vegetable oil was 575,000 yuan, basket crude oil was 570,000 yuan, small cart sesame oil was 600,000 yuan, and auspicious barrel crude oil was 615,000 yuan.

Flour, grains, and bean cake prices all held firm yesterday. Imported flour was 160,000 yuan, Wu flour was 110,000 yuan, and bran was 83,500 yuan, an increase of about 10,000 yuan. Dalian yuan beans were 190,000 yuan, Dalian green beans were 188,000 yuan, Pinghu Du beans were 235,000 yuan, and Chongming sand yellow peas were 185,000 yuan.

The price of various grades of raw peanuts rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Qinhuangdao raw peanuts were 345,000 yuan, Jiujiang raw peanuts were 320,000 yuan, Kaifeng raw peanuts were 330,000 yuan, Qingdao raw peanuts were 360,000 yuan, and Yingkou raw peanuts were 355,000 yuan.

Bean cakes also increased by several thousand yuan each. Shengji bean cake was 60,000 yuan, Renji bean cake was 60,500 yuan, Yuanlong bean cake was 60,000 yuan, Lizi bean cake was 61,000 yuan, Jianzi bean cake was 59,500 yuan, Yuji bean cake was 62,000 yuan, and Ying bean cake was 98,000 yuan.

### No Agreement Reached in Price Negotiations, Meeting to Resume Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The edible oil and flour price negotiation committees met separately in the afternoon of the day before yesterday and yesterday at the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Relevant parties from both industries attended, but no agreement was reached after discussions.

It is heard that the production costs proposed by the factories were calculated based on the raw material costs in Shanghai. Therefore, the calculated costs were still above the current black market prices. For our factory's soybean oil, calculated with Dalian soybeans at 185,000 yuan per "zu" (unit), the production cost of soybean oil proposed by the factory was 770,000 yuan per "dan" (unit).

For flour, calculated with wheat at 170,000 yuan per "dan", the production cost of flour proposed by the factory was 113,900 yuan per bag, which is higher than the current black market prices. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau instructed the merchants to re-examine ways to reduce costs. It is reported that people from the flour industry are scheduled to meet today to provide the lowest possible production cost of flour.

### Agricultural Bank Offers Tea Loans Based on Three Principles

Tea merchants believe that the tea loans offered by the Chinese Farmers Bank are too restrictive and have requested relaxation. According to the person in charge of the bank, the tea loans are based on three principles: first, to guide funds into production; second, to reduce costs; and third, to increase production speed. The total tea production for this year is estimated to be between 500,000 and 600,000 "dan". However, to date, over 1,600 tea merchants and tea factories have applied for loans from the bank. Their total estimated output is over 1.5 million "dan". Some of this may be inaccurate. Therefore, the bank stipulates that only tea merchants who can produce 300 "dan" of green tea or 100 "dan" of black tea can apply for loans. Also, to take into account production speed, the merchants must first purchase raw tea at cost, and then the bank will provide tea loans for repackaging and marketing. Tea merchants with small production volumes can apply for loans jointly, but no loans will be granted to tea merchants who do not meet the production requirements. Currently, loans are only being issued in Qimen, while other areas are still under production volume review.

### Increased Special Certificates to be Submitted, Chinese Stocks' Rise Slightly Weakened, Still a Few Limit-Up Stocks

Chinese stocks experienced a sudden rebound later yesterday. There was a rumor that 30% more special certificates would be collected for the next submission, and the market sentiment gradually cracked. However, China Silk and New Asia still stood firm at the limit-up price with environmental support, with many buyers still interested.

In the morning, Meiya and Wuhe opened at the limit-up price, while the other stocks saw mixed fortunes. After the opening of Diyi Spinning, stocks 224, 91, 188, 197, 129, 231, and 65 all advanced. China Silk, Commerce, and Cement also all rose to the limit. Diyi Spinning then rose to 6,900 yuan. Stocks 207, 223, 129, and 94 were sold, retreating to 6,850 yuan. Stocks 91, 180, 149, 184, 129, 145, 219, 97, and 28 showed strong momentum, rising to 6,970 yuan. New Asia also announced a limit-up, and stocks 231, 153, 155, 4, 232, and 23 were liquidated at high prices, falling to 6,830 yuan. Afterward, the trend turned to hesitation. After 10:40, foreign stocks suddenly became popular, and stocks 145, 219, 105, 16, 180, 117, 153, 12, 199, 219, 76, and 62 collectively purchased, and scattered short positions were also covered, pushing Diyi Spinning to 7,100 yuan. Stocks 145, 153, 183, 94, 60, 89, 213, and 162 unloaded, retreating to 6,720 yuan. The reason was the sudden rumor of a 30% increase in special certificates. After that, the situation was chaotic. Stocks 91 and 222 were bought, while stocks 94, 36, and 207 were sold. At noon, there was a major struggle around 6,880 yuan. However, after the close, stock 185 and others covered, and the quoted price rose to above 6,920 yuan, and the off-site quotations were high, resulting in an inverted yield curve. As a result, compared with the previous close, Diyi Spinning rose by half a percent, Meiya rose by slightly less than 10%, Xinhuo, Qinxing, and Yonggong rose slightly, Huafeng was flat, and Xinguang, Jingfu, and Xinhua declined slightly. In the delivery market, Meiya rose by slightly less than 10%, Qinxing was flat, Xinguang and Yonggong fell slightly, and Diyi Spinning, Xinhuo, Huafeng, and Jingfu rose slightly. Among the inactive stocks, New Asia, Wuhe, China Silk, and Commerce reached the limit up, Cement and Rongfeng retreated after reaching the limit up, rising by less than 10%, Jinglun and China Textile fell by half a percent, Match and Datong had small gains, and the rest generally fell slightly.

In the afternoon, due to news of continued reductions in Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraph charges, market sentiment recovered. Stocks 215 and 196 both saw slight gains. China Silk, Meiya, Commerce, and New Asia still reached the limit up. Diyi Spinning saw a high price of 7,060 yuan before falling. Stocks 49, 152, 97, 179, 183, 153, 4, and 47 were sold in succession, retreating to 6,850 yuan. Stocks 224, 199, and 100 advanced to around 6,950 yuan. Stocks 223, 160, 2, 22, 145, 77, 213, 89, 160, 154, 85, 105, 31, Ersi, and 153 were liquidated, resulting in an oversupply, retreating to 6,540 yuan. Stocks 77, 173, 97, Jiwu, and 215 took advantage of the low prices to gain, and the market stabilized near the close, with quoted prices rising to above 6,700 yuan after the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Diyi Spinning did not trade in the afternoon, Xinhuo rose slightly, Huadian declined slightly, Xinguang, Yonggong, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by slightly more than half a percent, Xinhua fell by 10%, and Meiya reached the limit up. In the delivery market, Diyi Spinning, Xinhuo, and Jingfu fell slightly, Huafeng, Yonggong, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qin and each fell by half a percent, and Xiya retreated after reaching the limit up, still rising by half a percent. Among the inactive stocks, China Silk, New Asia, and Commerce reached the limit up, China Textile, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Datong, and Jinglun each fell by 10%, and the remaining stocks had mixed fortunes. Off-site, each set a target to rise by another 10%.

### Facilitating Raw Material Purchases for Manufacturers, On-site Handling of Transfer and Re-hypothecation

### Foreign Stocks Weaken

Foreign stocks weakened sharply yesterday after rising. Securities were unloaded, and the situation became even more unsustainable in the afternoon. Yi Spinning opened at 900,000 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was strong, and the Guangdong traders bought in, reaching a high of 935,000 yuan, and British United reached over 150,000, before they began to decline. In the afternoon, they became even more weak and fearful, plummeting to within 800,000 yuan. Smaller stocks such as steel companies were even more unfavorable. As a result, compared with the previous close, steel and shipping each fell by slightly more than 10%, British United, Paper, Telephone, Reclamation, and Kaiping each fell by half a percent, and the rest generally fell slightly.

### Unified Bonds Decline

Government bonds weakened slightly yesterday. Unified Class C bonds opened at 20,000 yuan, with a high of 20,300 yuan. Although Room 503 made covering purchases, Room 552 and retail investors sold, and prices retreated to 17,800 yuan. About 10 million yuan was traded.

### Wang Longsheng Talks About the Tung Oil Export Crisis After Returning from Hunan and Hubei

Rampant Smuggling, Hong Kong Inventory Overflowing

The China Vegetable Oil Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to increase tung oil production and expand storage and refining facilities, sent its manager Wang Longsheng to Hunan and Hubei two weeks ago for an on-site investigation. Wang has now returned to Shanghai and stated that with overseas tung oil prices currently low, we must not only actively step up production, but also prioritize improving quality, reducing costs, and strengthening refining and storage facilities. The lack of storage facilities for tung oil merchants in Hunan and Hubei is the most pressing issue. The purpose of my trip was both to increase the factory's oil refining output and to serve the merchants by transporting goods from the producing areas to ships via pipelines and storing them in iron containers to save manpower and reduce consumption. After more than ten days of planning, this will be realized in the near future. For our factory's oil refining operations, the Hankou factory can refine 1,500 tons per month with storage capacity of 5,000 tons. Changsha and Changde can refine 2,000 tons with storage of 1,500 tons. Yichang can refine and store 1,000 tons each. With sound storage facilities, merchants can wait and see even if overseas market prices are temporarily depressed and sell when the price is right. Wang believes that the tung oil market price in Hankou is stable, and there is no shortage of inventory. There will be no problem even if large quantities are purchased. Smuggling is no longer easy. The facilities set up by the Transport Control Commission in South China have been quite effective. Hunan Province had a pre-war annual tung oil production of 35,000 tons. Due to wartime military unrest, production has decreased to about 20,000 tons. It is estimated that about 5,000 tons have been shipped out so far. There are also about 5,000 tons for domestic sales of "xiu" oil and "hong" oil. The remaining amount has been smuggled to Hong Kong to obtain black market foreign exchange. The routes are divided into Changsha and Changde. The actual amount of smuggling cannot be estimated at this time. However, for legitimate merchants transporting oil from Changsha to Hong Kong, including transportation costs, the resulting exchange rate back to the origin for purchasing goods has to be discounted by 40%. Conversely, the profits of smugglers are doubled. As a result, smuggling is rampant on the Hunan-Guangxi road, and Hong Kong's inventory is overflowing, creating a state of mutual undercutting. Prices are falling one after another, and foreign merchants are threatened by unstable prices, and their demand is sluggish. These are all internal crises of the tung oil market. As for external reasons, according to statistics after March, the United States imported about 20,000 tons of stored oil from China. Before the war, the United States' tung oil production was only about 7,000 tons per year. Now, it is accelerating the improvement of tung tree planting and oil extraction, which can increase to 10,000 tons. Its cost is less than two cents of a US dollar per pound. New inventions, such as the use of hard castor oil substitutes, also cost only two and a half cents of a US dollar, which is a strong competitor to China's export tung oil.

### Domestic Tea Market Active, Prices Up 20-30% From Previous

The various types of domestic tea that had been quiet for a long time saw a resurgence in the market yesterday due to a sudden surge in demand from Tianjin merchants. Initially, prices were stable, but later they spread like wildfire and became uncontrollable. As a result, the 35th-year Shanghui roasted tea soared from 350,000 yuan to 420,000-430,000 yuan per "zu". At the same time, flower Dafang tea jumped to around 800,000 yuan per "zu". Other teas, such as Zhulan tea, climbed to the high point of 1 million per "dan", an increase of 20-30% from the previous, and their positions were consolidated. Other varieties saw only sporadic sales, and the situation remained deadlocked. The foreign tea market was sluggish due to the narrow demand from buyers and the stalemate in negotiations, so trade remained difficult to boost and prices were unusually volatile. It is reported that there is currently a strong demand for tea in Europe, but due to price issues, it is difficult to export smoothly for the time being. The Xinhua Tea Company's foreign trade department will send personnel to Shanghai to inspect the actual situation of the tea market to facilitate the future export of Chinese tea.

### Distribution to Civil Servants and Teachers Expected to Begin Mid-Month

In Shanghai, it was originally scheduled to begin on the 5th of this month at the company's second retail store at 525 Jinling Road. The Civil Servants and Teachers' Distribution Items Review Committee has decided that the distribution will be based on the staff numbers of various civil service and education agencies in April. The list is currently being compiled. To facilitate the collection of cloth and avoid excessive congestion, the Textile Construction Company plans to send letters to the various agencies after receiving the list, arranging a scheduled date for them to collect the cloth money they are supposed to pay, and bring an official letter to the retail store to pay the money and collect the cloth. It is expected that the market will open and sales will begin around the middle of the month.

### Fujian Province Plans to Engage in Barter Trade with the Northeast

[Report from Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, May 5] In order to promote the sales of special products within the province, the Fujian Provincial Chamber of Commerce plans to engage in barter trade with the Northeast, exchanging Fujian tea and paper for Northeast soybeans and bean cakes. Cai Youlan, chairman of the chamber, has consulted with the Northeast Executive Headquarters, and an agreement in principle has been reached.

### Xinhua Bank's New Building Completed

Xinhua Trust & Savings Bank in this city, due to the expansion of its business, the original site was insufficient for application. The former Sassoon Building at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Jiujiang Road was purchased at a price as the site of the general Bank. It has now been renovated and will move to the new site for business on May 12.

### Sugar Market Weakens

Yesterday, the sugar market showed a soft trend due to the hope of the resumption of distribution by the Taiwan Company. Peruvian fine granulated sugar was initially 420,000 yuan, then 25,000 yuan, and finally returned to 19,000 yuan, a decrease of over 10,000 yuan. There were no changes in 24 coarse white sugar, 20 medium granulated sugar was at a small loss of 15,000 yuan, and car white sugar fluctuated little. Shantou green sugar maintained its original price due to few sales. Daoqing sugar fell by a small amount of 4,000-5,000 yuan, from 250,000 yuan to 246,000 yuan, with about 300 parcels traded. Xinghua white sugar ranged from 410,000 yuan to 395,000 yuan, and Xinghua red sugar was at a small loss of 5,000 yuan, ranging from 300,500 yuan to 290,000 yuan.

### Tobacco Industry Surges Again

The tobacco industry has been greatly boosted this year due to blocked routes and scarce goods on the market, and the recent surge has been particularly strong. Qingzhou medium-grade tobacco leaves are quoted at 15,000 yuan per pound, Xuzhou at 14,000 yuan, and Fengyang, Xinchang, and Sidu leaves are also rising in step.

[Another Dispatch] According to a tobacco merchant from Hangzhou yesterday, there are very few Sidu tobacco leaves left in the production area, and Shanghai merchants are flocking to purchase them. Each 112-pound package of loose leaves has risen to 800,000 yuan.

### Metals Rise

Since January, metal prices have been stimulated by the rise in the black market exchange rate and have been rising almost every day. The recent rise has been even sharper, and market sentiment is stronger than ever. Yesterday, people's head sanding cloth, copper pipes, and galvanized iron pipes saw the most severe price increases. Imported nails also rose by about 10%.

### Introduction to the China Stock Yearbook

The China Stock Yearbook, compiled by Wu Yitang, has been published. It is divided into two parts, the first part generally discusses the rise and fall of Chinese stocks, and the second part introduces the company content separately, and the collected data is quite rich.

### Boundless Spring Scenery on the Seine, A Picturesque View of Parisian Streets

— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

Paris Airmail, April 25th

The twenty-five short miles of the Strait of Dover separate two great European powers, turning them into two different worlds. This body of water not only divides two nations with distinctly different national characters, but also separates completely different climates and geographical advantages. In late spring, while London is still shrouded in heavy fog and seldom sees the sun, Paris is already a boundless vista of spring colors.

Anyone who has visited Paris will never forget this global city of flowers. The grandeur of the Arc de Triomphe, the flat, orderly, and tree-lined boulevards, the weeping willows along the Seine, the spaciousness of the Place de la Concorde, the elegant Eiffel Tower, and even the quaint charm of the Latin Quarter all leave an indelible impression. The French cherish beauty, art, and the appreciation of the joys of life. Therefore, Paris, honed over a century, is a city of beauty and art, offering something to admire at every turn. If London, Shanghai, and New York belong to the same type of city, then Paris, Beijing, and Suzhou-Hangzhou should be considered their opposites. The former impresses with busyness, chaos, tension, and restlessness, where people strive for money, status, and fame. The latter, however, offers a sense of peace, relief, and transcendent imagination. People live in this realm, slowly savoring the pleasures of life and seeking true beauty.

### A Lingering Question: A French Girl Speaks of Pétain

I am not exaggerating about the wonders of Paris. Two years ago, I spent some time in Paris shortly after its liberation, when everything was in disarray. The French had lost the Maginot Line in three weeks, compounded by the pain of four years of occupation. Gloom, disappointment, and discouragement filled the hearts and minds of the French people. They stood in groups in front of the National Opera House, watching young German lads leave and boisterous American kids arrive. De Gaulle had returned to Paris, Pétain was exiled, and Laval was guillotined. Most French people felt numb to the series of tragedies at that time. Until my recent visit to Paris, when a Parisian girl and I were strolling along the Seine at dusk. She said, "The French are impulsive and lack reason. The 'revolution' in the French mind is like a gust of wind, a short-lived burst of emotion. They never plan anything thoroughly." She added that "insulting old Pétain was an unconscionable act by the French people." She was in Paris at that time and knew of Pétain's dedication.

### Paris Has Changed: Vastly Different from Two Years Ago

The right and wrong of this issue may be more complex. In any case, I feel that Paris has changed significantly compared to two years ago. First, the economic prosperity, while not perfectly ideal, is undeniable due to France's industrial base and the speed of reconstruction. Two years ago, I frequented the Champs-Élysées, the Boulevard de la Madeleine, and the Montmartre area. The shop windows were empty, the restaurants had no meat or fish, nor enough bread, the hotels lacked hot water, and there were few cars on the streets. This time, the windows are filled with wool and silk fabrics, and genuine leather shoes (note: two years ago, French people wore wooden-soled shoes). Dining in restaurants, one can find everything as long as one pays black market prices. The hotels have returned to pre-war standards. The Grand Hotel and the Paris Hotel are filled with international merchants from abroad, with room rates nearly a thousand francs a day and the "No Vacancy" sign always displayed. The George V Hotel near the Champs-Élysées, formerly requisitioned by the American command, has been returned to its original owners and is now the top hotel in Paris, mostly occupied by diplomats from various countries, with room rates exceeding a thousand francs. The Scribe Hotel, formerly requisitioned by the Allied headquarters as a base for war correspondents, now occasionally sees a few Allied officers in uniform, but most guests are merchants traveling between America and France. As long as customers are willing to spend money, the hotels can provide anything.

### Public Streetcars: As Many As Eight Thousand Vehicles

After a separation of more than a year, Paris has indeed changed dramatically. The abundance of vehicles on the streets is something that was absolutely unimaginable two years ago. Most of the buses have been restored, and the yellow and green carriages are always packed. There are now as many as eight thousand "public streetcars," and hailing a "streetcar" in Paris seems more convenient than in London. On the fifth day of my visit to Paris, all the streetcars suddenly went on strike, reportedly because the government reduced gasoline rations and black market gasoline prices were too high. Apparently, the government later relented, so the next day, eight thousand streetcars reappeared on the streets, full of vitality.

### Subway Trains: Each Line is Arched

The most important means of transportation in downtown Paris should be the "subway train." I have traveled to so many places, but I admire the Paris subway the most. New York's... [omitted word], seeing the subway train makes one's head swell. The carriages are dark, the seats are not comfortable at all, and the stations and tracks are covered with fruit peels, newspapers, and even gum wrappers. When I was in New York, I often thought that Americans could defeat Germany and Japan, but no one had a way to clean the New York subway. Many people praise the London Underground for being clean, orderly, and comfortable, and for being deep enough to be used as an air-raid shelter during wartime. But I still think Paris's is better. The Paris system is good, each line is arched. Stepping into the subway from any entrance, you will never get lost. Following the map, you only need to transfer once at most to reach your destination. Some people say that the Moscow subway is like an "art palace." I have not been to Moscow and dare not comment casually.

### Borrowed Foreign Exchange: Most of It Was Spent a Year Ago

During this visit to Paris, the subway is as crowded as ever. The fare has increased from two francs to four francs per ride, and the distinction between first and second class has been eliminated. More than a dozen entrances that were closed two years ago have now been repaired and reopened. When I arrived in Paris, it was shortly after De Gaulle's speech, and the political upheaval in France was brewing intensely. I saw many political slogans posted on the walls of the subway.

I plan to report on the inside story of the political upheaval in France in my next dispatch. The current political and economic life in France is developing in a distorted and abnormal way. Most of the foreign exchange borrowed from the United States has been spent in a year, and the main items in customs import figures are food and cigarettes. France is still using troops in Madagascar and Vietnam, there are small-scale riots in North Africa at any time, and there are 300,000 to 400,000 overseas troops. Coupled with the military expenses of occupying Germany, the government's financial budget is still on the road to collapse.

### Shop Windows are Covered with 10% Discount Slogans

However, in Paris, these phenomena are hidden behind the stability and prosperity. Since the Socialist Party came to power, it has loudly promoted several things: The first is that all shops, hotels, restaurants, barber shops, clothing stores, etc., strictly implement the "10% discount movement." Each shop's door is covered with a printed slogan: "10% discount." The French are smart, and the French businessmen are even smarter. On the one hand, they strictly implement the law, and on the other hand, they first raise the prices by 10% and then sell them at a 10% discount. Most of them did this. However, the clever Prime Minister Ramadier is smarter than those businessmen. Once, he said to a French reporter, "That's good. My original purpose was not to expect them to reduce prices, but to hope that they would not increase prices. Although the price reduction did not succeed, my purpose has been achieved!"

### The Second Masterpiece: Confiscating the Property of Merchants Who Profited from National Crisis

The second masterpiece of the Socialist Party's economic measures is to confiscate the property of merchants who profited from the national crisis. Every day, the Socialist Party government's official newspaper, "Le Populaire," often discloses "for example" news: A Romanian "scavenger" youth drifted to France five or six years ago. At that time, it was when the Vichy government surrendered. This Romanian youth, because he colluded with the Germans, actually made France's "national crisis fortune" and became a multi-millionaire. After the war, he used his funds to continue to manipulate the black market in Paris. "Now, after an inspection by the Police Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior, all property has been confiscated." For example, there are almost such legendary stories every day. In his recent speeches, Prime Minister Ramadier often compares his predecessor government with the current government. He said: The Socialist Party government has the ability to subdue France's economic crisis, and it wants the people to be calm, quiet, and work hard.

### The US Dollar Plummets: Foreign Tourists Suffer Great Losses

However, Ramadier's masterpiece is not here. What he is most proud of is the recent plunge in the price of the US dollar, from the highest black market price of 375 francs to one to the current 190 to one. The Socialist Party government said: This indicates the stability of the French economy and the stability of the franc monetary system. However, insiders do not think so. Prices in Paris have not fallen, but foreign currencies have fallen. Therefore, the unlucky ones are foreign tourists. These days, French newspapers are studying the reasons for the drop in the price of the US dollar. It is a long story, and the reasons are very complicated. One of the immediate causes is that the French National Bank sold the gold it stored in Switzerland, absorbing a considerable amount of market hot money.

These deformed economic mutations are somewhat similar to China. I have been away from Shanghai for ten years. Perhaps, Shanghai's "prosperity" and extravagant paper money are comparable to Paris in the East and West. The mainland edition of London's "Daily Mail" wrote very harshly one day, saying: The British won the war, and the French did not fight. Now that the war is over, the British are bound to endure the "bitterness" rarely seen in the world, and the French are enjoying the "happiness" never seen in the world. How can this be read as fair?

Enjoyment is the nature of the French. Without happiness, there is no beauty in life. Without beauty, living is no different from dying. Therefore, "drink today, for tomorrow we die" has become the common life philosophy of the French people, especially the Parisians. Isn't it? The dance halls connected to the Champs-Élysées, the various nightclubs in the Pigalle area, the bare breasts of women, the naked legs of women, plus the decadent and nauseating music. The strong atmosphere of wine, powder, and perfume, plus the unnatural laughter of women, are all mixed together.

Winter is the season when Paris is cloudy and dormant. When spring comes, hundreds of flowers bloom on the Seine. In New York for a year, you can't hear the birds singing or smell the flowers. Once you arrive in Paris, you see green everywhere, and your tightly bound heart seems to be liberated. This morning, I hailed a streetcar and set off from the riverside in the Latin Quarter, "driving" along the banks of the Seine. The green river water reflects the green shade on the banks, shaking slightly. Dozens of granite "arch bridges" on the Seine, reflecting the warm morning sun, decorate the boundless spring scenery of this world city of flowers.

### A Four-Day Trip to Central and Southern Taiwan

— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

The restoration of Taiwan is an epoch-making event; the February 28th Incident in Taiwan can also be said to be a not-so-small major event after the restoration. Looking back now, the bloody February 28th Incident should be a terrifying day; people felt that the commotion and narrow-minded xenophobic actions of the past year and a half, in the emotional shift from eager anticipation to disappointment and resentment, might have a reaction, but what ordinary people directly felt was that the scope of the facts was not as large as that, and the bloodshed was not as much. In particular, Taichung, Chiayi, and Kaohsiung in central and southern Taiwan were the most fierce, the situation was the worst, and the time was the longest.

In a short time of one hundred hours, the reporter made the first post-unrest pilgrimage to the hinterland of these three bleeding points of the February 28th Incident.

### Survivors: Full of Thrilling Stories

The reporters left Taipei on an early express train on the 29th of last month. In the past, it was possible to buy second-class tickets and sit in comfortable seats, but now it is impossible. Even if you buy first-class tickets, you still cannot find a seat. The number of trains during the day has been reduced, and military control is in place in the evening, so it is not possible to pass through. As a result, all the passengers are squeezed into the few trains during the day.

When the reporters visited local leaders, everyone congratulated each other on surviving the catastrophe. And when each person recounted his experience during the incident, it was like listening to different thrilling stories. The stories are full of blood and tears. Obviously, the local leaders who were able to avoid accidents relied on their usual behavior, and more importantly, they were able to adhere to their positions and endure the suffering to display the sense of justice of loving the nation and the country.

Kaohsiung Mayor Huang Zhongge is a "half-mountain" (Taiwanese people satirize mainlanders as "Ah Shan," call mainlanders who come from the mainland provinces "half-mountain," and call Taiwanese women who marry mainlanders "leaning against the mountain," calling it "three mountains"), and still cannot avoid receiving threatening and intimidating gifts from thugs. When he led seven senators to visit Commander Peng Mengji at the fortress headquarters, one of the thugs was carrying a short gun and attempted to assassinate him. This scene was terrifying. Chiayi Mayor Sun Zhijun retreated to the airport during the unrest, but still risked his life to negotiate with the thugs. His wit helped him escape from the tiger's mouth. Taichung Mayor Huang Keli from Quanzhou speaks Hokkien, but in such unrest, the Hokkien language of "Ah Shan" lost its effect. He also needed to be able to speak Japanese. The thugs could not forget Japan. He escaped from Wufeng back to the city and was "concentrated" again, suffering great danger and coercion. The Taiwanese communists wanted his magic weapon: the official secret code.

### A Kind of Trial: Great Lessons in Suffering

This time, it was a lesson for both officials and civilians, and even more so a trial for the military police and constitution.

Chief of Staff Wang Jie of the Kaohsiung Fortress Headquarters recalled that it was painstaking to deal with the situation at that time. For the safety of the people, the maintenance of public security, and the protection of life and the harbor, he had to fight, but in order to obey the orders from above not to act rashly, he could not fight. He could not fight the people. To fight or not to fight, this was the most hesitant problem.

Li Shirong, the squadron leader of the Chiayi Gendarmerie District, led all eighteen comrades to escort public servants to retreat in the midst of urgent gunfire, and then re-entered the city. In the end, there was a fierce battle at the airport. The thugs threatened him in writing and by phone to surrender his weapons, otherwise "120,000 citizens can use a bamboo pole" to kill all mainlanders. Due to the weakness of the strength, weapons could be surrendered, but in order to maintain the integrity of the soldiers, they must not surrender rashly. Therefore, to surrender or not to surrender made him painstakingly consider.

The local authorities carefully adhered to and properly handled the emergency situation under the circumstances of "expedient handling," which was indeed a kind of trial. The arrival of the thugs was like a rainstorm, and both the official and civilian sides lost control. 80% of the police officers that administrative officials could command were Taiwanese, and they all abandoned their posts in the face of the enemy. A military stimulus without strength only increased the arrogance of the thugs. In the midst of suffering, we saw the division between good and bad people, and we also saw the indomitable and awe-inspiring spirit of resistance of the soldiers, and the situation of the unarmed public servants was even more pitiful.

Of these three major cities in central and southern Taiwan, the one that lasted the longest was Chiayi, and the situation was also the most tragic. 20,000 people participated. When the reporters surveyed the "battlefield" in the city, they could still see trenches and bullet marks.

What we are most concerned about are the death and injury figures. The statistics provided by the local governments are:

Chiayi: Mainlanders (Public Servants)

Dead: 11 people

Injured: 51 people

Minor injuries not included

Taiwanese:

Dead: 406 people

Injured: 131 people

Missing: 9 people

Kaohsiung: Dead and injured officers and soldiers (guarding warehouses): 31 people

Executed according to law: 14 people

Soldiers who violated military discipline: 2 people

Taichung: Mainlanders:

Injured: 50 people

Dead: 5 people

Taiwanese:

Dead: 2 people

The above is just a preliminary investigation figure. In the case of Chiayi, as far as the reporter knows, the actual number is more than this.

### Good Taiwanese Compatriots Are Still Respectable and Loveable

This incident has a common point, that is, the thugs all came from Taipei. They took trucks to various places to incite, collude with local thugs and hooligans, and political careerists took the opportunity to move around, and in the final stage, a small number of communists joined in. In various places, "General Staff Headquarters" or "Operations Headquarters" were established, and below them were several teams and several groups. And they all put forward "conditions," distributed Japanese leaflets, and Japanese-style military equipment. In addition to knives and sticks, there were also light and heavy machine guns, and even small steel cannons. They had different goals. The hooligans tried to surrender their weapons to make capital, the careerists wanted to take the opportunity to become officials, and the communists participated in discord and sabotage. Under different goals, they showed a complex, naive, and pathetic struggle and xenophobic action.

Most of the hooligans retreated from the mainland and overseas, and some were released from Fire Island. Among them, there are hundreds of thousands of people in total, and most of them are soldiers. The political careerists are all "Star People's Association" figures. Because the government was lenient, they became the "red people" of the people after the restoration. The communists were probably not members of the CCP or the Japanese Communist Party, that is, these people called "Taiwanese communists," in the midst of most of the good people, directed an unprecedented bloody tragedy under the pretext of "suppressing smuggling."

From another perspective, the good Taiwanese compatriots are still a lovely and respectable nation.

During this incident, witnessed and touched, many well-behaved Taiwanese compatriots, farmers, and workers never participated, and they also protected the place where they worked as their own business, and some even rescued mainlanders regardless of their own safety. An old man in Huwei, Taichung, hid a mainlander platoon leader and had his ears cut off. He is still in the hospital now.

### The Blood Crack Needs to Be Quickly Repaired

The February 28th Incident wrote down the record of the bloody crack between mainlanders and Taiwanese. Currently, it is the period of appeasement and village cleansing. The party, government, and military cooperate to investigate the population and collect weapons. This will be the end of the incident. During this period, the people unanimously hope that the government will be lenient and not investigate the accomplices except for the main culprits, and they also hope that there will be a public trial and a clear execution according to law. This has already been promised by Minister Bai. It is worth noting that the voice of protection for public servants is rising everywhere. They embrace a passion and cross the ocean to work for this newly born island province. As a result, their treatment is lower than that in the country and they cannot make ends meet, and they have also obtained unexpected "retribution." This complaint is waiting for the compensation of the feelings of mainlanders and Taiwanese.

We must not ignore the most important factor that contributed to the bloody incident: the reflection of Japanese thought and culture. And the people's lives are unstable due to high prices, which directly touches everyone's heart. Naturally, the re-transmission and re-education of thoughts and culture must enable the Taiwanese compatriots to imperceptibly expand their horizons and minds, and develop their love for the motherland!

The blood crack needs to be repaired quickly and properly. The new strength will be more solid than before. I hope that the February 28th Incident will be a new turning point in Taiwan.

### Tentative Suggestions for Road Construction in This City

Recently, roads in various parts of the city have been gradually repaired, and Tianmu Road is undergoing major reconstruction. I am optimistic about the city's construction and very excited. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I respectfully offer several suggestions for our municipal authorities to consider, which I disclose in this column: (1) It is necessary to open up a road through the racecourse, connecting east, west, north, and south, to alleviate traffic congestion in the central area. (2) Connect roads in the eastern district directly to the Xinza District and the West Shanghai District, so as to avoid passing through the central district roads south of the Suzhou River. (A) Connect Tiantong Road on North Zhejiang Road to Alabaster Road (separated only by a cemetery), and then connect it to Kulun Road, which will lead to the Xinza Bridge. The Xinza Bridge must be rebuilt to allow vehicles to pass, so that vehicles in the eastern district can directly reach the Xinza District via this road. (B) Widen and straighten Xinmin Road to Hengfeng Road Bridge, so that vehicles in the eastern and northern districts can directly reach West Shanghai via this road. (3) According to the current traffic situation, the roads in Shanghai must maintain a width that can simultaneously accommodate trams, cars, and various slower vehicles, so as to avoid congestion and collisions. Therefore, the main traffic lines in Shanghai should be gradually widened, and the planned new roads, as well as the central urban area, Zhabei District, West Shanghai District, and South Shanghai District, should especially have their width enlarged in advance to meet the future development needs of Shanghai. It seems that fast lanes and slow lanes should not be separated, because separation seems inconvenient and uneconomical, as can be seen on Zhongzheng Road. (4) The existing houses along the roads that have been moved back or destroyed in the war should be widened immediately, and shantytowns or wooden fences should not be allowed to encroach on the road surface again, or to build reed fences and pile up debris on the sidewalks, hindering traffic. (5) It is common to see many large and small stones, gravel, cement blocks, asphalt blocks, or mud and dirt accumulated on the sidewalks of the city's roads. It seems that the public works authorities should collect and pile them up in open spaces, storing them for other uses, because old materials are not without their uses, and it is also a way to save materials to supplement the insufficient construction funds, as well as to make the roads clean, to facilitate traffic, and to improve the appearance. (6) After the roads in the city are repaired, it is common to see stones, gravel, and stone chips left on the roadside, which often mix with garbage over time. The repaired gravel roads are often not firm and solid, and become loose, uneven, and bumpy in a few days. This is not because of reducing materials and cheating on labor, because there are surplus materials that are discarded on the roadside. This inevitably wastes labor and materials, and makes citizens feel that the municipal administration is poor. Our public works authorities should strictly supervise to avoid wasting manpower and resources. (7) There are often many garbage or dirt piles along the roads in the city, or the ditches are blocked and the water does not recede. In the morning, there are also dung carts leaking dung juice on the road, which is truly a feeling of dung and dirt. I think that Shanghai, one of the world's major cities, is truly ashamed of even a cleaner small city. Moreover, the summer season is approaching, and isn't this city promoting epidemic prevention? I think that giving vaccinations in garbage piles is not as good as clearing garbage and dirt first. I hope that our health authorities will not just promote it, but should also work hard in practice, because to talk about hygiene, environmental cleanliness is the most basic condition. (8) In order to remove garbage and excess gravel and mud bricks in this city, it is best for the Public Works Bureau to build a temporary road from Pudong along the highway to Chuansha East Coast, where a beach slopes out into the sea, roughly parallel to the coast. On the one hand, two car ferries should be built in the Huangpu River to transport cars across the river. The Health Bureau can then use this construction to transport garbage and sand, soil, bricks, and stones to the seaside, gradually accumulating them on the beach. Over time, it may form a long and narrow breakwater, and the inside of the breakwater may form a small harbor for sailboats or fishing boats to dock. Given the large amount of garbage in this city, and the fact that it has always been a difficult problem for the municipal authorities to deal with, my suggestion may be helpful in solving this problem.

### Two Army Commanders of the Divine Eagle Unit: Cultured General Sun Liren and Tough General Pan Yukun

— Our reporter Zhao Zhan

Aviation News from Changchun, One Day

In the eventful Northeast, the Divine Eagle Unit, the New First Army, which defends the borders of the motherland, has glorious battle achievements in protecting southern Songjiang. Their blood and sweat flow on the thorns on the road to the great unity of the motherland.

This is a glorious army. The fame of the former army commander, General Sun Liren, has spread far and wide overseas. He is a cultured general, and caring for the people is the fine tradition of this army. He is warmly loved by the people everywhere. It is no accident that the Divine Eagle Unit has achieved outstanding battle results. General Sun has been promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Command. He told reporters about his feelings about the promotion: I feel that the burden on my shoulders has been lightened a lot. However, his enthusiasm for serving the country and the nation is overflowing and remains firm for a long time. He said: A female reporter called him an old general, which is really regrettable, and then he laughed heartily.

The new army commander, General Pan Yumin, was originally the commander of the 50th Division of this army. He is a resolute and decisive model soldier, and also a tough general with a loyal heart and iron bones. On the front line of the Songhua River, in the Communist army's New Year offensive, Lin Biao fought him head-on several times. The defense of Dehui was the most disheartening for Lin Biao. Lin Biao besieged Dehui with tens of thousands of troops, attacking fiercely for a week without being able to take it, suffering great sacrifices and having to retreat in the face of difficulty. The reporter met General Pan in the war zone at that time. After many sleepless nights, he told the reporter with red eyes: "The Communist bandits are going against me and are deliberately looking for trouble for me." The isolated and arduous struggles of the bridgehead on the north bank of the Songhua River in the previous battles best represent the tough bones of General Pan's subordinates. Even if the Communist army pulled out their teeth, they could not pull out this iron nail. Their brilliant battle results have earned their troops the glory of being named the Zhongzheng Division, and the company that stubbornly defended the bridgehead was named the Zhongzheng Company.

At his first press conference after being appointed army commander, General Pan said: If I receive the order to take over Harbin, I will announce this good news first. It can be seen how deeply he cherishes the motherland and the nation with a loyal and passionate soul. The following is a brief introduction to General Pan's resume: Pan Yukun, courtesy name Kongxi, is from Liuyang, Hunan. He graduated from the fourth class of infantry and the fourth class of the senior class of the Huangpu Military Academy. He received training in the Lushan and Luojia Mountain Training Groups and Lamgarh in India. In 1925, he served as a probationary officer, platoon leader, company commander, and battalion commander in the newly編2nd Division. Later, he participated in the Northern Expedition and was wounded. In 1937, he was promoted to Colonel and Commander of the 83rd Regiment of the 14th Division. He participated in the Battle of Shanghai and was wounded. He was transferred to the commander of the honor regiment of the division. Then he was transferred to the commander of the 80th Regiment of the 14th Division, Brigadier General Infantry Commander, Brigadier General Deputy Commander and Director of the Political Department of the 50th Division of the Army. In February 1944, he was promoted to Commander of the 50th Division. On April 5 of this year, he was promoted to Commander of the New First Army and Commander of the Changchun Garrison.

### Maugham Promotes Emerging Writers

The British playwright Maugham (Somerset Maugham; the "gha" in this name is silent, pronounced "Mawm," and should not be translated as "Maoganmu") gave 15,000 pounds to the British Writers' Association as a fund to be awarded annually to promising writers under the age of thirty. The prize is selected by three judges from the Writers' Association. The only condition of the prize is that the writer must spend the money abroad.

Maugham said: "He can go wherever he wants. If he likes, he can go to Monte Carlo and gamble it all away within a week; or, if he is more economical, he can use the money to travel around the world for a week. This reward is for someone who has published a book, whether it be poetry, novels, biographies, or philosophy, as long as the judges think he will achieve something in the future.

"I ask the judges not to hesitate and not to be afraid of taking risks. I said that it doesn't matter if they choose the wrong nine out of ten. I think it would be very worthwhile if only one writer could really produce something every ten years that would enrich English literature.

"In short, it would be a very good average if ten writers could be produced every century."

Maugham had this idea forty years ago, when he was just starting out as a playwright. He told Shaw that the judges should not be too old, preferably not over forty. People over forty may not understand new ideas. The combined age of the three judges will probably not exceed one hundred and fifty years.

Maugham said, "I originally wanted to put this in my will. But I'm afraid I won't live that long. I can't wait, I think it's best to give the money away while I'm still alive."

Two Chinese literary magazines, "Literary Renaissance," often publish the works of emerging writers, and "Literary Spring and Autumn" recently published a special issue on emerging writers. This intention can be said to be the same as Maugham's.

### Passing Through Xinning Again (Sketch)

— KM

How serene is this small mountain town!

A masterpiece forgotten by Lope de Vega and Shakespeare,

Thrown alive into this stone urn.

It is Kathmandu under the Wuling Mountains;

It is a pictograph of Graz in a small country.

At noon, the sun rises from the peaks hanging with green vines,

Soaring straight up to the sky, to look down on people's lunch;

The fortress leaning westward falls,

How short it is, a dream!

Pomelo candy is still on the market,

The pear-shaped small berries in autumn, fragrant, sweet, and refreshing!

Now hire a boat to the Fuyi River! Across the river, in Longjian,

See the Cinnamomum camphora and nanmu trees, forming a forest of maple and nanmu,

Bananas that do not bear meat, transplanted to Lingnan,

Become fresh and tender food.

These are just the landscapes under the brush of ink painters!

Traveling east from Wugang by sedan chair, after four days of dangerous mountain roads, we arrived at a small stone rest pavilion east of the city street. As usual, there were some disabled people in the pavilion, either huddled in the corner of the pavilion or selling rice noodles and fried glutinous rice cakes. Jiao Tang got out of the sedan chair and said that the first thing to visit was the Liu family, a prominent family in Xinning (the elderly Liu Hongdu, the newly appointed member of the Legislative Yuan's Audit Committee, grew up in this ancient mansion).

Jiao Tang still remembered that during the first Battle of Northern Hunan six years ago, he had visited the Liu residence when he came here for reasons related to the front line. The buildings, pavilions, and terraces in the residence, and the pavilions and kiosks facing the ancient pond, had a bit of the flavor of the Ten Temples of Shichahai in Beijing. The towering camphor and nanmu trees and arhat pines grew around the high walls, and the painted corridors and carved beams and the elegance of the doors and walls were like viewing ancient paintings.

The Liu residence has such a ancestral elegant and leisurely environment!... It is said that their ancestors were meritorious personnel under Zeng Guofan and Zuo Zongtang, and the blessings of that time are still shining brightly today. Jiao Tang walked past the gate of the Liu residence and hesitated for a long time. It was not until the gatekeeper said, "Principal Liu! (Mr. Hongdu's younger brother) is not home yet," that he stepped straight in.

Turning from the back street to the riverside, we saw Xinning's only middle school standing in the blowing mountain wind, with willow catkins all over the walls, just shaking outward non-stop. Before long, we suddenly met Mr. Lin, whom we had known six years ago. When asked about Xinning in the five years since we last met, he said;

"What else is there to say! No one expected that the saying 'Peach Blossom Spring can avoid Qin' would not be fulfilled at all. The burning, looting, and robbery in the past six months were unavoidable every day. Most of the utensils in our house were transported from remote rural areas."

### The Uniqueness of Poets

— Yang Shi

In Tsurumi's "Biography of Byron" in Japan, there is such a passage:

In 1811, when Byron had just returned to London from traveling, he received the bad news of his mother's death. It turned out that she died because she was angry about the furniture merchant's increased price bill. Byron painfully rushed back to his castle to bury his mother. Strangely, he did not continue the funeral to the cemetery, but stood at the door and stared blankly. Finally, he called the servant Boyford to bring boxing gloves, and they fiercely wrestled with each other at home. It is said that he used this fierce fight to relieve the grief in his heart.

After passing through a narrow river street, Jiao Tang suddenly thought of Qi Pin, who used to eat dog meat early in the morning, an expert on Ibsen who lived in Shaoyang, Xinning. He also recalled the painter Yang Taiyang from Guilin, the poet Wu Benxing from Anhua, the high-pitched singer Qian Weizhen from Hangzhou, and the educator Zhou Zhenbang from Beiping, who often visited each other... They all moved to the interior from various transportation hubs, and then were introduced and came to this mountain country.

Not long after this group of people started winter, Qi Pin suddenly suffered a family tragedy of "shooting his wife with an air gun," and then they all went to various places to serve their new masters. Jiao Tang still vaguely remembered that on the day before he left Xinning, he went to the prison in the county office to visit Qi Pin. Qi Pin said with a smile, very naturally:

"Who knows what the reason is! Killing his wife, huh, I don't even understand it myself... I'm still confused now... However, when my father and brothers were alive, because their power was great, they had many enemies. I can't help but feel a little implicated..."

Recalling the past, Jiao Tang couldn't help but mention this plot to Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin said that Qi Pin had been extradited to the Shaoyang prison long ago. His case seems to be never asked about in Xinning. It will always become a confusing trap... Could someone be teasing him?

Is Xinning such a place? Are people so treacherous and wolfish in their hearts? It doesn't seem like it... They are so gentle and don't show their emotions on their faces!

Mr. Lin told Jiao Tang that the German missionary who lived in a fortress below had returned, and many parts of his house had been destroyed by the Japanese. He returned to this empty temple, and like us, he felt lonely every day!... Let's go across the Fuyi River to take a look while it's still early."

### Three Records of Cherishing the Remaining Spring - Sequel to a Dream in Yangzhou, Sixteen

— Hong Weifa

In addition to what was mentioned in the previous record, there were also many particularly interesting people among the guests at Xiyuchun at that time, which must also be recorded:

(1) Xue Wansui was an old scholar. Every evening, he would drink four taels of liquor and get very drunk. After getting drunk, he would hum the lines from Peking Opera, "Long live the emperor, the little one gets drunk every day." People therefore called him Wansui (Long Live).

(2) Liu Daling This person used to be a magistrate. But he had a violent temper. After expelling his concubine, he lived alone. He ate almost all three meals at Xiyuchun. And he ate and drank arbitrarily, spending about one yuan per meal, but he paid in cash and never kept an account. And because there was no one at home, all the deposits and rent collection records were rolled up in his horse-hoof sleeves.

(3) Jin Sanhuazi His family was very well-off, but the clothes he wore were extremely tattered. If someone in his family occasionally made him new clothes, he would immediately take them away and sell them, claiming to be a beggar. Because he was the third child, he was called Sanhuazi (Third Beggar).

(4) Wang Huotou was good at singing opera. If his peers offered him a cigarette, he could sing a long song. He claimed to be from the Wang Guifen school, so people called him Huotou (Fire Head). He was also good at poetry, but he was addicted to opium and was so poor that he often went hungry. He just draped his long gown over his left arm and refused to put it on. When asked why, he said, "My long gown is crisp, and it will fall apart if you touch it!" (

(5) Jiang Menshen was a doctor. He was not good at chess at all, but when others were playing chess, he would always interrupt. If the chess players tried to stop him, he would become even more energetic, gesticulating and pointing randomly on the board. People would respond with angry voices, but he would not get angry and would still interrupt. Because he was very tall, people called him Menshen (Door God).

(6) Wang Laoben was over seventy years old, but his face was extremely rosy. Some said that his face resembled a peach blossom. He said, "These four characters are not like a near-body poem." People therefore added "Wang Laotai" to make it a seven-character sentence. He liked to play and make trouble with people, and often used his dry tobacco pouch to hit people. Because he was old, people did not fight back, and just laughed, like children.

(7) Guo Daizi practiced medicine and also taught at a private school. He lived in Niansi Bridge and called himself the Guest of Niansi Bridge. He entered the city at three o'clock every afternoon and left the city at ten o'clock. If the city gate was closed, he would sit in Xiyuchun all night. Because he liked to drool, people called him Daizi (Fool). Or someone would give him a couplet: "At the head of Niansi Bridge, composing poems and writing antithetical couplets; in the nineteenth hell, teaching at a private school and practicing medicine."

(8) Duan Zhang This person was a scholar. Because he was short, people called him Ai Zhang (Short Zhang). He especially liked to use false allusions to deceive people. If people asked him where they came from, he would laugh and say, "Why be serious!"

(9) Nandou and Beidou Wang and Qu, both over sixty years old, often sat facing each other at a table outside the counter, but they never said a word to each other. Qu was humorous, and people called him Nandou (Southern Dipper), while Wang was dull, and people called him Beidou (Northern Dipper).

In addition, it should be mentioned that the guests at Xiyuchun also organized a music association. Participants had to come up with a pseudonym, and the pseudonym had to be related to their name. For example, Mr. Zang Yisun, my late great-grandfather, changed his name to Zanghuo (Zang's slave), Mr. Ji Lianggong changed his name to Jili (Lucky), Mr. Xuan Guyu changed his name to Xuanbu (Announce), Mr. Kong Xiaoshan changed his name to Kongfang (Square Hole), Mr. Tan Yiwei changed his name to Tanxian (Talk Leisurely), and Mr. Ji Jinping changed his name to Jinqian (Money). Even the owner, Tuo Weng, changed his name to Gaoxing (Happy).

### The Tombstone of a Maiden

— Liu

A Papillose-style statue of a pitiful Greek maiden, standing there sadly, her left hand holding a small box, her right hand seeming to be taking out some ornaments from the box, but no ornaments were carved out. Observing its traces, it can be known that it was originally painted with extremely gorgeous colors.

There were many such works in early Greece. In prehistoric times, there was originally painting first, and then relief evolved from painting. This tombstone should be a hybrid product in this process.

The layout of this work, the technique of clothing, and the expression of the body are truly remarkable. It can be said to be representative of the upright style of the first half of the fifth century BC. It was originally collected by a noble family of Venus and later acquired by a German and entered the Berlin National Gallery. Made of marble, it is 1.428 meters high.

### Night Rain - A Small Record in Sickness

— Xuan Jianren

It is late at night, and the rain is playing metallic music on the roof. Outside the window, darkness stretches in all directions. The dim light of an oil lamp in the sickroom cannot sweep away the darkness in the room. I can't sleep, but I can't control the wild horse of my thoughts. When I was sick as a child, my mother's care was so kind. As long as I turned over or coughed, she would gently walk to the bedside; even late at night, my mother would watch over me without closing her eyes; now, she is far away in ancient Chang'an. Listening to the sound of the rain outside the window, I have endless thoughts...

Groans came from the next sickroom again.

Sickness, this demon, when can it be eliminated? My young life has not yet bloomed into a brilliant flower, so let it wither silently like this, I am not reconciled, I want to complain to heaven!

Many past dreams, one by one, prompt me to revisit them: Xin, far away in the Northeast, Ruo, still remaining in the mountain city, Zhu, who has lost contact, Ying, who is already the mother of children... Each dream is a poem written with my heart's blood, let me recite it in the quiet night, recite it to the end of my life. I want to write my name on people's hearts.

The rain is falling, falling.

### The Poet's Last Words of Heroism

— Meng Long

The death of a great writer is often the end of a tragic drama. The poet Goethe, on his deathbed, probably feeling the gloom of the world, shouted out a final heroic saying: "More light!" The poet Heine, who was contemporary with Goethe, did not forget to propose his will before his death: "Please insert a sword and a pen on my tombstone!"

### One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood 503

— Ye Jingfeng

"Is that Mr. Gu Chengzhi? This is Shouyi on the phone." Because Tsurumi used his original name on the hotel registration and had told Shouyi the brief history of this original name, Shouyi greeted Tsurumi using this name: "I'm telling you two things; first, that letter..." (referring to the mysterious letter paper with a black circle drawn by Elder Aoki). "Although it is written strangely, I have already consulted Elder Juechang of my village. The old man said that this letter must be seen by the original recipient before it can take effect..." This explains that this mysterious letter must be seen by Pingzi herself before it can take effect. Shouyi vaguely told Tsurumi that Elder Juechang was not unable to use this effect; however, Pingzi was Elder Aoki's medium for spiritual communication, so of course it was most in line with the principles of spiritual science to communicate through Pingzi herself...

"In case the recipient herself cannot come out, the old man has promised to do it himself by midnight." Shouyi explained this point to reduce Tsurumi's anxiety. Even if Pingzi has not come out of the bandit's den after midnight, Elder Zechang can also try it out.

"The second thing that needs to be explained, according to the old man's analysis, the one in the Hongzhen area is the most suitable of the three 'nests'. Although it is said that the two people being escorted there are both men, perhaps this is a smokescreen by the bandits to make it difficult for people to guess. In addition, the old man has realized that the bandits' method probably has other purposes. As for what purpose, because the old man is not very clear about the inside story of Japanese spies, he cannot explain it for the time being... Our village people intend to have other methods for these three nests, but the steps have not yet been determined, so we will talk about it when we meet again..."

Tsurumi received this phone call from Shouyi, and a big stone fell from his heart. Originally, his greatest goal in coming south with Pingzi this time was of course to eliminate the "Secret Operation of the Eighth" planned by the Japanese military. Of course, he himself was not considered proactive in this move, and Pingzi, the proactive executor, was indeed mysterious in her actions, but in reality, she was probably just a tool, receiving instructions from Elder Aoki behind the scenes; even she herself was mechanical, receiving one instruction and implementing one step.

However, when it came to this final and important step, she unexpectedly encountered this kind of accident, and the time was so tight; the last trick in the bag was just a black ink circle. Except for Pingzi herself, this order was simply a dumb riddle, and it could even be said to be a bit of an excessive game, even childish. Just imagine, if there were no revolutionary people like Han Wan to participate in the action at this time, no top counterintelligence executives to send Li Ming to cooperate, and no patriotic elements of Bai Ren Village to support them, would it be possible for Tsurumi alone, with only Zheng Yan added, to solve this thorny problem if they encountered it?

Furthermore, although Tsurumi had made various conjectures about this "Secret of the Eighth" in Beiping and W, etc., and later Pingzi had explained the nature and method of this secret, how could the Japanese military, after racking their brains and arranging such a huge secret operation, be child's play, and how could it be so simple? What is the key? What are the steps to launch this huge secret? Even if the key can be grasped and the steps of the launch are clear, how can it be destroyed? Even if there is now a definite and complete method to destroy it, is it possible to fully accomplish it with such limited time?

### Poems from Mengwai Building

— Xu Chengyu

Inscription on Jiang Yonghong's posthumous manuscripts

The deceased has posthumous manuscripts, the paper and ink are scattered; flipping through the volumes, I recall his life, his spirit still in sight; the clear words chase the white snow, the autumn wind echoes the green bamboo; facing each other in silence, I brush away the dust and feel the flowing waterfall.

Thanking Lu Yanshao for the painting he gave

Mr. Lu's brushstrokes are unmatched in the world, the lofty scholar in the forest seems about to come out; the wind and smoke are vast and come between the pines, the secluded art of the steep stream returns to the clouds and sun; he gave it to me from afar to hang in a corner of my seat, looking at it, I feel clear and unrestrained and transcendent.

### Bi Xiang Pavilion Lyrics

— Chen Jiaqing

To the Tune of Qi Tian Le: Summer Night, Harmonizing with Qingzhen

Water and clouds sever the north and south of the flowers, as the woods gradually darken with the approaching evening. Floating duckweed carries fragrance, gulls dream serenely on the waves, one would do well to lightly tailor a lotus leaf robe. The silver screen hides the moon; the oil lamp exudes a cool smoke; a light breeze stirs the Xiang River bank. I idly murmur, incorporating the clear lament of Chu poetry into my verse.

It is difficult to ask about past events; the passage of time startles the years, and sorrows know no bounds. Beyond the bamboo, flutes play; beside the wine, swords are discussed, all to no avail, leaving the autumn heart to twist and turn; the fine evening stretches far. I await the ice-cooled pistils of the flowers, freshly presented on a jade platter, stirring up idle feelings; my dark eyebrows knit with worry.

Sweeping Flowers, Strolling Through Pines, Evening Sitting with Elder Sister Yu

A light chill resembles wine, just past the drunken Double Ninth Festival, countless chaotic sorrows. Walking along silently, facing the delicate beauty of autumn, I idly chant beautiful verses. The phoenix leaves rustle; how much wind and rain can they endure? Quietly looking back, beside the pond under the willows, I still seek a pleasant spot.

How much beauty remains? This time, we renew our clear wandering; gathering joy beside the verses. The fleeting years fly by, afraid that an inch of autumn light will quickly fade away. With a short flute and the west wind, I want to entrust my idle feelings. Silently I gaze, watching the setting sun gradually lower into the trees.

### Casual Talk While Anchored

— Wang Cong

Greek mythology recounts—

Prometheus was humanity's benefactor because he stole fire from the heavens for humans, and was thus imprisoned by the fire god Zeus. Later, Zeus realized he was a prophet and intended to restore his freedom, but the self-possessed Prometheus believed that suffering for humanity was his duty, and ultimately refused the fire god's pardon.

Suffering and tribulation are the inevitable fate of all prophets.

Expressed in philosophers and religious figures, it is calm endurance, without complaint. Socrates drinking hemlock and Christ being nailed to the cross have both forged immortal sacred events in history—this is the ultimate good in humanity's ideal.

And expressed in poets and artists, it is passionate shouting; a deep and unwavering affection. Like Qu Yuan and Dante's exile and Sima Qian's acceptance of the terrible punishment of castration, they did not yield, and continued to dedicate themselves to others until death—this is the ultimate truth in humanity's ideal.

Therefore—truth, this—good; to seek harmony and balance with the beauty of the universe is the glorious purpose of life.

A friend asked me about my view on life, and I answered with the above words.

### Ideal Couple

— Ge Yi

Mrs. Yang Siqi, a French woman, embraces her pure love to travel around the world, searching for her ideal couple. This kind and great lady hopes to explore the secrets of love in the love between husband and wife, so that there are no abandoned husbands and resentful wives in the world, and further, that human love is immersed in harmonious happiness.

Mrs. Yang recently arrived in Shanghai. On the 30th, she gave a public lecture at the Lyceum Theatre, titled "Traveling Around the World in Search of the Ideal Couple." She said that she had been to Italy, Palestine, Spain, and Paris, but in the places she had passed through, some couples were filled with love murders or hostility, some exchanged sweet kisses but held sharp knives in their hands, some lived licentious lives, some endured monotony, and some, because they had no children, inevitably made the lives of the couples lose warmth. Finally, she arrived in Shanghai and finally encountered a happy couple. The secret of the love of this most ideal Chinese couple is that they have a week of silence every three months, during which they refuse all external affairs, so that the whole family is in a state of rest. After this, they return to their original state.

I really don't know if Mrs. Yang's announcement is true or just a joke? If the happiness of love lies in this separation and reunion, then the ideal couple does not seem to be so difficult to achieve. If this is not a conclusion, then what is the ideal couple? Does an ideal couple exist in the world?

I once had a vague idea: all "ideals" are eternal, but to seek the "reality" of this ideal is a bit like trying to catch the moon in the water. The love between husband and wife is also the same. We can have an "ideal couple," but we will never find a "perfect couple." This is because the ideal is the most forward-looking, and when the ideal becomes reality, another new ideal is beckoning us. Many couples often feel that their family lacks something and is not ideal enough, but when they make up for that defect, they cannot be satisfied. Some feel that their family is quiet and gloomy because they have no children, but when they have children, they hate the hustle and bustle of the family! Humans can never be satisfied in reality, so humans always generate their ideals; pursuing ideals and promoting reality may be the driving force of social evolution.

Is the happiness between husband and wife mysterious? What is the secret to harmonious love? These are all determined by subjective temperament, knowledge, and health. And both sides are relative, not absolute.

Tolstoy once had a famous saying: "Men and women must return to their respective jobs." Perhaps the ideal couple is produced under such conditions.

### Money Can't Buy

— Yan Anfu

On my first night back from overseas, I went to visit my sweetheart. Her father and mother, being discreet, left us alone in the parlor to talk. As we were embracing and kissing, I suddenly noticed her young sister standing at the doorway, staring at us with wide eyes. "If you're willing to be a good girl, go back to your room and go to sleep," I said to the little girl, "then I'll give you twenty-five cents."

The child did not accept my bribe, nor did she speak, and ran away. But she came back in a little while. "Here's fifty cents," she said, "let me watch you."

### About Six Records of a Floating Life

— Bao Zhongqi

Six Records of a Floating Life is a widely read book because of its special style, with an autobiographical story, combining life art, leisurely feelings, landscape scenery, literary criticism and art criticism, and so on. Therefore, Chinese authors mostly love this book. Lin Yutang is the best example. He once translated it into English, and it was published in sections in the English T'ien Hsia Monthly and The China Critic. Later, it was published as a separate book by The China Critic, translated as Six Chapters of a Floating Life, which made foreign readers linger and unable to put it down.

The author was Shen Fu (Sanbai) from Suzhou during the Qianlong period. Although it is not known when he died, according to the self-description in the book, the writing of the fourth record must have been after 1808. The existing four records were discovered by Yang Yinchuan at a cold stall in Suzhou and were first published in 1877. The titles of the four records are: "Joys of the Bedchamber," "Leisurely Interests," "Adversities and Sorrows," and "Joys of Wandering." As for the missing two records, they are "Records of Zhongshan Travels" and "Records of the Way to Nourish Life." From Guan Yiwei's "Preface" and the surviving table of contents, we know that the fifth chapter records his experiences in Taiwan, and the sixth chapter records his insights and feelings about the way to nurture life.

However, the Six Records of a Floating Life (published by the World Book Company) currently printed on the market has actually found the missing two records. It is said that this was also discovered by a famous writer in a certain place in Suzhou, and the chapter "Records of the Way to Nourish Life" has been corrected to "Records of Nourishing Leisure." Of course, the discoverer has his own basis. Whether it is reliable as Shen's handwriting, we don't need to discuss it; however, the author occasionally talked about this matter with my teacher Zheng Yimei, but knew another fact about Six Records of a Floating Life, which may be somewhat related to the "newly discovered" two records.

According to Zheng, he also heard that a famous old writer discovered the two records in Suzhou. The old man passed by a tea farmer's field and saw a farmer reading it. After borrowing it to read, he was shocked to find that it was the entire Six Records of a Floating Life. In surprise, he borrowed it for a day and read all six records. He deeply believed that it was still written by Sanbai. So he rushed back to Shanghai and signed a publishing contract with the World

Professor Feng Wenbing (i.e., Feiming) of the Chinese Department of Peking University is scheduled to give a lecture on "Buddhism, Confucianism, and Western Philosophy" at the Jushilin in Xisi Pailou on the morning of the 27th. (Mi Xilin) Bureau. When he returned to Suzhou again, the farmer had taken it and moved away, and his whereabouts were unknown. After searching for several months, he found nothing. The old writer couldn't help but be distressed, so he discussed it with my teacher Yimei, because his writing style was quite similar to Shen Fu, and he planned to rewrite the two records to the best of his memory. My teacher did not dare to agree and politely declined. As for the detailed circumstances of the World Book Company's publication of Six Records of a Floating Life, whether the two records were recovered or were forged by later generations, it is unknown.

### Recent Events at Peking University

— Mi Xilin

Student organizations such as the councils of the three colleges of liberal arts, sciences, and medicine at Peking University, the Autonomous Association of the First Year, the Autonomous Association of the Preparatory Class, and the Departmental Association of the Economics Department have established the Peking University Student Commemorative May Fourth Preparatory Committee and will hold a May Fourth Commemorative Week. The program is tentatively scheduled as follows: May 1st is a science evening, May 2nd is a literary evening, May 3rd is a history evening, the morning of May 4th is various ball games, and the evening is a bonfire party. May 6th and 7th are drama evenings.

The Peking University "Peking Man" wall newspaper, in order to commemorate the "May Fourth" and promote its great spirit, is scheduled to hold a "May Fourth Historical Materials Exhibition" on that day. Newspapers, magazines, political associations, documents, private letters, and souvenirs related to historical materials are being actively collected.

Professor Feng Wenbing (i.e., Feiming) of the Chinese Department of Peking University is scheduled to give a lecture on "Buddhism, Confucianism, and Western Philosophy" at the Jushilin in Xisi Pailou on the morning of the 27th.

### Introduction——"News World"

— Ke Pei

——An excellent reporting publication

In the case of a lack of material conditions, a good publication can still continue to operate, which will make the editors and readers feel very happy.

First of all, I have to introduce some of the articles in this issue. Regarding the domestic war situation, there are Mo Hesha's "The Battle of Yan'an: Five Days and Six Nights" and Wan Zhaojing's "The Communist Army Around Jinan and Others," which clearly portray the war situation of the past month in the most concise writing style. Generally, when writing current affairs articles, one either thinks too highly of oneself or underestimates the other party. This not only easily loses the truth of the current situation, but also often plunges the reader into a fog. Here, one can stand on an objective position and report based on facts, which is very commendable. The political insider story is Song Zhongtang's "Several Big Guns in the Third Plenary Session," which not only objectively reports the facts, but also portrays the personalities of several representatives. The Taiwan incident that occurred a month ago and the Dalian takeover issue that attracted worldwide attention are also reported in detail here. The rest, such as "British Virgin Queen Elizabeth" and "Cucumber Peeling Season," are light and meaningful, with endless aftertaste.

I am very excited to have finished reading every article in this issue. Here, you will discover things you didn't know. Although it can't be called a good teacher, it is enough to be a beneficial friend. Naturally, shortcomings are still unavoidable. A reporting publication should preferably be coordinated with time. Taking this issue as an example, articles such as "The Battle of Yan'an: Five Days and Six Nights" and "Taiwan: An Artificial Typhoon" all happened a month ago. Wouldn't it be better to see them sooner? Therefore, if economic conditions permit, we very much hope that "News World" can be changed to a bi-monthly publication.

### Literary and Art Circle

### The Tragedy of the Heavenly Music Pavilion

— Lei Ke

The Heavenly Music Pavilion of Wing On Company has been closed since May 1st for the sake of "maintaining morality." It is said that the 600 employees of the building have been trapped inside for five days, and their usual savings have been exhausted. Now, all the food they eat is supplied by sympathetic people. A reporter went to inspect and saw men, women, old and young living together, wives crying and children wailing. The scene was so miserable that people couldn't bear to look at it. It is foreseeable that these 600 employees and their families will have to go hungry under this state.

The Heavenly Music Pavilion's harm to morality is well known. And it has been harming for a long time. Why is the boss suddenly reversing his previous behavior and wanting to maintain morality now? However, people always have an upward heart. We can't say it's bad for the boss to want the Heavenly Music Pavilion to abandon evil and return to righteousness, but the problem lies with the 600 employees and their families. The boss has abandoned evil and returned to righteousness, but the employees' livelihoods have been cut off. The employees' usual duties are not necessarily related to morality, but when the boss wants to close the business and they all ask for an extension, they are tantamount to asking to maintain the business that harms morality, as if the boss wants to run on the right path, and they are dragging him into the evil path. If we can look a little further, the employees should really give up this request.

But the problem of eating is more serious than that far-sighted vision. Once the business is closed, they will have to go hungry. The employees have no savings, so naturally they cannot maintain it for long. The supply from sympathetic people is not much, and it cannot be maintained for long. In this situation, only the boss can take into account the past relationship between the host and the guests. Over the years, he has made so much money from these employees. He must make a big decision and think of a way to open up a path to life for them.

There are really many places like the Heavenly Music Pavilion that need a renovation movement to "maintain morality." For many years, many people have been doing some kind of business that directly or indirectly harms society with the tacit consent of society. We all advocate stopping or innovating these things. However, the first condition is that the host must first find another way for those who rely on this for a living, otherwise the good flowers will not bloom, and the bad fruits will have already been formed. The tragedy of the Heavenly Music Pavilion is an example.

"Probably thirty-odd people." Zhu Zhaonian replied with a smile on his face.

"Probably thirty-odd people? No! No! There must be an exact number! This is official business. How can you just say whatever you want!" Director Yu looked very disapproving.

Zhu Zhaonian was caught off guard by this hurdle and was immediately speechless.

"Go back and get an official document! And a list of names!" Director Yu, with an iron face, shouted like he was dealing with a servant.

"But... but..." Old Zhu looked back at the clock on the wall, anxious and dizzy.

"This is official business!" the other party replied like a roar. Old Zhu got up and left. He knew that arguing with old yamen officials with such deep habits was a waste of time. Fortunately, there were still six or seventy minutes until five o'clock. He estimated that he could rush back to get an official document and bring it back in time, so he ran back desperately. Relying on the large number of people in the troupe, they actually managed to get the official document and the list of names together in a short time. - It was Zhang Chang who took the lead and wrote Zha and Fei Ji into the list.

Breathless, Old Zhu rushed back to the Traffic Bureau again. It was just twelve minutes before five o'clock. He rushed like a gust of wind to Director Yu's desk.

"The official document and the list of names are all here! Sorry, please process it quickly!" He pleaded with the Director, who was smoking and reading a newspaper, his voice trembling, and he couldn't control himself.

Director Yu slowly put down the newspaper, first picked up the envelope and looked at it for a minute or two, then took out the letter paper inside and looked at it three or four times; suddenly, his malnourished, withered brown face sank again, and at the same time, he shook his head repeatedly.

Zhu Zhaonian's heart jumped.

"No! There is no official seal on the official document, we can't account for it!" Another reason that Old Zhu would never have expected.

"But we are a troupe, where would we get an official seal?" Old Zhu began to get a little angry.

"No, this is official business!" Again, two formulaic, unreasonable official words.

"Does that mean we have to temporarily carve one?" Old Zhu's eyes widened, his body leaning forward, staring tightly at the old civil servant who had lost most of his humanity. "But, your car is leaving early tomorrow morning!"

"I can't control that, I only know official business!" The other party turned his face away, unmoved.

Now, Old Zhu really couldn't bear it any longer. He reached over and snatched the official letter from Director Yu's hand, immediately stood up, took huge strides, and rushed into Director Tai's office. (65)
