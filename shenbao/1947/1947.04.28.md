From the 23rd, two columns fiercely attacked Tai'an, three columns maneuvered towards the southwest of Tai'an and the area north of Dawenkou, one column attacked Dawenkou, and another column suddenly moved south and eastward. For five days, the National Army followed the planned strategy to intercept and engage the invading Communist forces in bloody battles. Reinforcements arrived continuously, further boosting morale.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 26th] Over the past week, the war situation in Shandong Province has become increasingly optimistic, and the focus of the war has shifted from southern Shandong to central Shandong.

The fierce fighting lasted four days and nights. By the evening of the 25th, the battle had become increasingly brutal. Communist casualties are estimated to be at least over ten thousand. The National Army in southern Shandong, taking advantage of the Communist main force's northward movement, completed a large encirclement of the Fourth and Sixth Columns entrenched in the mountainous area south of Loude, northeast of Sishui, with one part of their forces. Another part of their forces routed the Ninth Column entrenched in Baimaguan and Jiunvguan, southwest of Mengyin, and the main force of the Eighth Column in Mengyin. The vanguard has already entered Mengyin and is currently pacifying the local area and comforting the refugees. As for the National Army in the Linyi area, they have pushed the Communist Seventh Column to the vicinity of Ju County. The Second Column, unable to withstand the attacks, fled to Xintai. The National Army along the Jiaoji Railway has also eliminated Communist resistance and advanced to the area between Longshan and Mingshui.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] It is learned that the Communist army recently transferred over four thousand infantry soldiers from Yantai, Shandong Province.

Zhao told reporters that the puppet municipal government of Dalian recently issued 300 million yuan in public bonds, and the people are living under tyrannical oppression. Many have been bankrupted by buying the public bonds. In addition, patriotic youths are arrested and secretly assassinated, with several cases occurring every day. Recently, as news of the National Army's entry into Lüda has spread several times a day, the Communist army has colluded with certain parties to violate public opinion, organize the Guandong State Public Office, which is nominally democratic but in reality a pretext and conspiracy by certain parties to obstruct the National Army's takeover.

### Li Huang Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing; Will Go to Nanjing to Decline the Position of Minister of Economic Affairs

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Li Huang transited through Chengdu and arrived in Chongqing today. He is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 29th to attend the Standing Committee meeting of the China Youth Party, and then go to Nanjing to meet with President Zhang to firmly decline the position of Minister of Economic Affairs. He told reporters: "When I heard in Chengdu that the Central Government was going to assign me to the position of Minister of Economic Affairs, I immediately telegraphed Mr. Yuejun to decline. However, the day before yesterday, I received a reply telegram from President Zhang saying that the appointment had already been announced when he received my telegram, and that I should come as soon as possible to take on the difficult task together. I am a mere scholar and have not studied practical political affairs. The economic undertaking has countless threads, and I fear that I will cause mistakes in the future. It is better to decline in advance. Therefore, I have decided to go to Shanghai the day after tomorrow to explain my intentions at the Standing Committee meeting of the party, and then go to Nanjing to firmly decline to President Zhang. As for the rumors that the Youth Party is advocating participation in local politics, the policy program clearly stipulates that all parties should jointly promote the implementation of constitutionalism. Now that the Youth Party has already participated in the central government, it should also bear its responsibility for local politics."

[Report from This Newspaper] The standing committee members of the Youth Party in Shanghai and responsible personnel of party affairs from various regions held a meeting at the headquarters on Haig Road all day yesterday, which was very tense.

### Relief Funds Universally Distributed in Yan'an; The Market is Increasingly Prosperous

People Present a Banner to the Chairman

The total amount of the French loan is set at 20 million US dollars, but part of it will be paid in French francs. This is a compromise that partly meets the Chinese government's hope, which is to pay in French francs. However, the correct ratio of French francs to US dollars in the loan has yet to be resolved.

### Internal Rift in the Chinese Communist Party Deepens; Launch Anti-Mao Zedong Struggle

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] Over three hundred Communist soldiers, captured by the National Army when recovering Shiyu, have been escorted to Datong. According to the captured Communist soldiers, Chen Shaoyu (Wang Ming), Lu Dingyi, and others have an organization called the "Chinese Communist Party Members Democratic Association" to oppose the leadership of Mao Zedong. Chen and others advocated that the CCP's sabotage of the Political Consultative Conference was caused by instructions from certain parties. The Mao faction attempted to use force to overthrow the government and split the country. Now, the terror of "rectification" has spread to all departments, especially intellectuals who feel most uneasy. The internal rift is deepening. This proves that the CCP's blind action of being hostile to peaceful nation-building has been abandoned by enlightened people within the party.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The anti-Mao movement within the Chinese Communist Party has intensified since the National Army recovered Yan'an. This can be proved by the anti-Mao propaganda materials recently seized by the National Army at the front. These propaganda materials are signed "The Emergency Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet-Luzhou-Anhui Border Region Party Affairs Committee." The original text of the propaganda materials is as follows:

(1) Oppose Mao Zedong's Use of Armed Force to Seize Power

After the victory of the great Anti-Japanese War, our commanders, fighters, and the people of the whole country still cannot get rest and continue to live a life of war, born in fire and dying in battle. This is such a painful thing. Everyone should know that this is entirely the evil consequence of Mao Zedong's leftist mistakes in using armed force to seize power.

However, the policy of armed struggle for the past twenty years has not increased the CCP's political status, but has led the party into a dead end. The ten years of land revolution sacrificed the main force of the Red Army, who broke through and went north, and ended the consolidated Jiangxi Soviet regime in armed struggle.

Since the eight years of sacred resistance against Japan in the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, the armed forces under the leadership of our party have grown stronger in the national liberation struggle. We created many great and moving achievements in the self-defense war against Japanese imperialism. At that time, we absolutely agreed and strongly advocated it.

Now, the people of the whole country need rest and need to live and work in peace. In the tide of peaceful and democratic politics, we advocate peaceful construction and rationally resolving the Kuomintang-Communist issue. We oppose Mao Zedong's subjective rule of the entire party, using armed struggle to seize power, and abandoning the struggle for the epoch-making Political Consultative Conference. This is entirely a blind action of left-wing opportunism. All comrades of our Emergency Committee cannot sit idly by and watch Mao Zedong lead our party on the road to danger. As early as in the resolution of December 1, 1944, we lodged a serious protest to Mao Zedong, pointing out the left-leaning errors of the Mao faction.

In the past three years, Mao Zedong's left-leaning errors have not only not been corrected, but have become even more willful, expanding the army, and purely taking the heroic concept of using armed force to open the world, causing bloody flames to burn again all over our country. The people of the whole country, who came out of the arduous and dangerous national war, have been dragged into this innocent domestic civil war. This is not only a loss to the people, but also a loss to our party itself.

Before and after the political consultation meeting of various parties, how much did the people of the whole country, various small parties, and social leaders sympathize with our party and support our country to resolve national affairs politically? However, since the Mao faction promoted the Datong and Zhangjiakou battles, and transferred Zhou Enlai back to instigate military blind offensive operations in various places, how many comrades has our party lost? The reaction of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, social leaders, and the people of the whole country to our party is so bad that they have turned to the Kuomintang, causing a great political blow and loss to our party. Obviously, this is the result of Mao Zedong's heroic thinking of using armed force to open the world.

The final moment is approaching. The fact is that the Mao faction's left-leaning error of using armed force to open the world is no longer allowed to continue. We call on all loyal comrades of the party and the people of the whole country to unite and launch a struggle against Mao Zedong's left-wing opportunism and the civil war that disregards the interests of the people!

We want peace, we want to live and work in peace!

We want Mao Zedong to admit his mistakes and stop the civil war

We support the Emergency Committee in forcing Mao Zedong to step down

(2) Oppose Treating the People as Cannon Fodder

In the past few weeks, the military setbacks in the Lunan area, from the breakout from Linyi to today, have gone through many fierce battles, sacrificing countless excellent commanders and fighters and heroic militia members within the party, especially the number of militia members who sacrificed is enough to make us surprised. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, people will still see this bloody reality. This is entirely the evil result of Mao Zedong's left-leaning ideology.

Mao Zedong said, "China has 400 million people, and we will sacrifice 200 million people to achieve the final success of the revolution." If these words really become a reality, how terrible is Mao Zedong's cruelty! He simply wants to turn 200 million people into cannon fodder; besides exposing Mao's hideous face, there is really no reason to find it!

Today, the people need peace and need rest, which is an iron fact after the war. According to the current domestic and international situation, peaceful democracy is the only trend! There is absolutely no room for strong debate. We only have a political solution to gain legal status, lead the people to the road of prosperity and happiness, and then there is a way out!

Disregarding the interests of the people, treating the people as capital for war, and driving the people to the battlefield as cannon fodder will definitely be opposed by the people one day. We have always advocated opposing domestic civil war and opposing treating the people as cannon fodder. The country is composed of the people. We love the people and consider everything for the benefit of the people. The people want to live and work in peace and not be cannon fodder for the Mao Zedong faction. Only by supporting the Emergency Committee and joining hands with us can we launch a struggle against Mao Zedong.

Stop the domestic civil war and realize democracy!

Oppose treating the people as cannon fodder!

### The Kuomintang Central Political Committee Holds its First Meeting Today; The Main Topic is to Discuss Political Policies

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The first meeting of the Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang is scheduled to be held at the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 28th.

### US China Policy to be Finalized: Truman and Marshall to Discuss, Announcement Possible Before End of June

[United Press International, Washington, 27th] According to well-informed sources here today, the issue of American policy toward China may be one of the least urgent Far Eastern matters awaiting Marshall's attention. State Department officials predict that Marshall and President Truman will begin reviewing the US stance on China around June 30th, before the expiration of the frozen US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan to China. They stated that this review would take into account Chairman Chiang's appointment of Sun Ke as Vice Chairman and Zhang Qun as Premier of the Executive Yuan to broaden the base of his government. However, they were unwilling to speculate whether this review would relax the US's already announced policy that the US must wait for Chairman Chiang's regime to democratize before providing economic assistance. Their unanimous opinion was that the "wait-and-see" policy should continue for at least another two months. State Department officials predict that Marshall will decide on the timing of the Japan conference in the coming weeks. They are currently unaware whether the failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to make any significant progress will cause further delays in convening a conference to draft a peace treaty related to Japan. The US State Department had assumed that the US might propose holding this conference in Washington or San Francisco this autumn. This assumption was based on the belief that the greatest difficulty for the four foreign ministers in reaching an agreement on the German and Austrian treaties could be resolved at the Moscow conference, but this belief has now been proven false.

It was then believed that after the United Nations General Assembly convened in New York in September of this year, the US authorities could shift their attention to the Japan issue. Now that no agreement has been reached on the German and Austrian issues, the Foreign Ministers Conference must be reconvened in London, and some officials believe that the Japanese peace conference will be postponed until at least next spring. Other officials believe that even if the Allied nations continue to dispute European affairs this autumn, the US should still prepare to convene the conference this autumn as originally planned. Therefore, Marshall's opinion is eagerly awaited by all parties, as President Truman will undoubtedly listen to his opinion.

Regarding other Far Eastern issues that Marshall must decide on, there are issues involving Korea and China. However, people here cannot determine whether Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's acceptance of his invitation to reconvene the US-Soviet Joint Commission in Korea is a sincere acceptance, as Molotov still clearly insists on excluding certain Korean groups from participating in the Korean interim government. The unanimous opinion here is that the resumption of the meeting may be hopeless. However, at the same time, most officials admit that if the meeting cannot be convened, it will give the Soviets a favorable opportunity for propaganda. This may be what Marshall wants to avoid. Marshall should also decide when to submit the State Department and War Department's plan to aid Korea with $450 million to Congress for discussion. Officials here say that regardless of the outcome of US-Soviet negotiations, the economic aid plan for Korea will be requested to be passed by Congress. However, they also said that the timing of this request to Congress would be decided after Marshall consults with President Truman. According to the original steps, it was intended to submit the request for aid to Korea as soon as Congress passed the aid plan for Greece and Turkey.

### 271 US Navy Ships to be Transferred to China by Truman's Order, Delegation Sent to Assist Chinese Navy

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] President Truman today issued an executive order directing Secretary of the Navy Forrestal to transfer 271 surplus US Navy ships, ship equipment, floating docks, etc., to China, and to send a delegation led by Du Hua to assist the Chinese Navy. The law authorized by the US authorities for the Secretary of the Navy to implement was passed by the previous Congress to help China expand and maintain its navy. Although the previous Congress passed this bill in July of last year, today's action is still to implement this plan to maintain China's navy, which has been delayed until now due to the clarification of the Chinese political situation. Truman's order today gives Marshall the final decision-making power, as the Secretary of the Navy is instructed to handle this matter, but still needs the consent of the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State believes at any time that the transfer of ships or equipment is not conducive to the public interest, then the transfer should be stopped. The contents of the President's order are as follows:

(1) Allocate 271 surplus smaller naval vessels and the necessary floating docks to China at no cost. (2) These ships and floating docks should be repaired and equipped, and China should pay for all equipment needed for their use and maintenance in cash. (3) Deliver to China the plans, blueprints, other documents and reports related to these ships and floating docks, and send China non-confidential technical reports and recommendations for establishing and maintaining the Chinese Navy. (4) Train Chinese personnel to use these ships and floating docks, and other naval personnel deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Navy. (5) Plan to send up to 800 US Navy or Marine Corps officers and up to 200 enlisted personnel to assist the Chinese Navy. Navy officials said that the number of ships to be allocated to China in the first batch and the schedule for their allocation are now being drafted.

The bill to allocate ships to China is the Vinson Act, which was passed by Congress last year, but stipulates that the President shall not allocate battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, or submarines to China without the consent of Congress. The US Navy planned to allocate these 271 ships to China in February of last year, while this bill was still under consideration in Congress. These include six escort destroyers, six buoy and marker supply ships, 217 landing craft, six motor gunboats, four 136-foot submarine chasers, six 173-foot submarine chasers, ten 110-foot submarine chasers, three oil tankers, one survey ship, two repair ships, two floating docks, and eight motor minesweepers or submarine chasers. A Navy official told a Central News Agency reporter that some of the ships allocated to China under the Lend-Lease Act will also be included in these 271 ships allocated to China by the Secretary of the Navy under the President's order. He also said that the ships could be delivered to China as soon as the training of Chinese sailors in the use of these ships is completed and Marshall approves of it.

According to reliable information obtained from Chinese community groups and officials in Vietnam, five French military aircraft flew over Yonglian City, Yonglong Province, in southern Vietnam at 4:00 PM on the 15th of this month, and bombed the Yihe Valley, the second concentrated area for Chinese nationals in the city, killing three Chinese nationals and injuring one. At 9:00 AM the next morning, three French aircraft flew over the area again and bombed heavily. The Yihe Valley warehouse was hit, killing more than 100 Chinese nationals seeking refuge and injuring more than a dozen. In the past, Yonglian City had planned to implement a scorched-earth policy, forcing residents to evacuate. Our Chinese nationals specially set up two concentrated areas near the city, hanging the national flag high to identify them, and had formally notified the French side to provide special protection and not to drop bombs over the concentrated areas. Our Consulate General had also written to the French Commissioner in Southern Vietnam to forward the notification to the French military authorities, requesting special attention. Therefore, the French side should bear full responsibility for this tragedy. After hearing the report, our Consul General in Saigon, Yin Fengzao, immediately lodged a strong protest with the French side, and sent officials to lead doctors to the area where the incident occurred to handle the aftermath and investigate the details. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a strong protest with the French Embassy in China, and has telegraphed Ambassador Qian stationed in France to take similar steps, demanding that the French side earnestly acknowledge responsibility, fulfill France's promise to protect Chinese nationals, and promptly punish the perpetrators and provide compensation.

### Li Zhuchen Writes to Urge Prohibition of Exporting Raw Salt to Japan

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Industrial magnate Li Zhuchen recently published a speech entitled "To Save the Crisis of China's Chemical Industry, the Export of Raw Salt Must Be Absolutely Prohibited." He estimates that to make the chemical industry prosper, the domestic minimum annual demand for salt is 200,000 tons, while China's largest salt factory, Yongli, only produced 60,000 tons before the war. The factory was occupied by the Japanese for eight years, and the machinery was severely damaged. Although efforts have been made to repair it after the takeover, the current output is still less than half of what it was before the war. Therefore, it is still necessary to increase production by 170,000 tons to meet the needs of the national chemical industry. Therefore, he makes another appeal to prohibit the export of raw salt to Japan.

### UNRRA Representative in Philippines Discusses Philippine Attitude Towards Handling Repatriation of Overseas Chinese as Unconventional

[Central News Agency, Manila, 26th] A local evening newspaper quoted a senior diplomatic source as saying: The Philippines' "diplomatic reputation" abroad may be seriously affected by the Philippine government's failure to properly handle UNRRA's request. UNRRA had previously requested the Philippine government to allow Chinese nationals who are currently stranded in Xiamen and who were indeed residents of the Philippines before the war to return to the Philippines as soon as possible. The newspaper said: The current lukewarm response of the Philippine government to the requests that the overseas Chinese can make through UNRRA is generally considered extremely inappropriate by diplomatic personnel here. UNRRA Representative in China Ganis refused to express what possible reactions the Philippine government's lukewarm attitude would cause in Washington in the future. He said: He personally believes that the Philippine government's attitude is unconventional and fundamentally contrary to the spirit of cooperation shown by other UNRRA member states in the work of repatriating displaced people around the world (this is one of the main tasks undertaken by UNRRA). Ganis clarified a previous report saying: The number of overseas Chinese that UNRRA requested the Philippine government to repatriate was only 4,000 people, and the figure of 7,600 people was a misrepresentation. The number of 7,600 people was the number of overseas Chinese repatriated to China by UNRRA last year. These overseas Chinese were sent to the Philippines by the Japanese during the occupation period to work as coolies, and the 4,000 overseas Chinese waiting to be repatriated to the Philippines left the Philippines before the war, or were forcibly transported to China by the Japanese during the occupation period, or avoided returning to China due to the oppression of the Japanese army during the war.

Editorial

### An Evaluation of the New Banking Law

The banking industry in modern society is related to public welfare. Although banks are established with capital raised by shareholders, they absorb the savings of people from all walks of life and then use them. Therefore, the safety of banking operations not only affects all shareholders but also affects the general public. As a result, the government must regulate banks to ensure social and financial stability. Although the organization of banks can be based on the Company Law, the regulation of banking operations and the protection of public rights depend on the implementation of the Banking Law.

After the establishment of the National Government, in view of the importance of banking operations, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Banking Registration Regulations and Implementing Rules in January and April of the 18th year of the Republic (1929). The purpose was to restrict the establishment of banks with poor organization, insufficient capital, and improper operations, in order to prevent problems before they occur. In March of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the National Government promulgated the Banking Law, consisting of 51 articles, which strictly regulated all aspects of banks, including the organization, minimum capital requirements, establishment approval procedures, scope of operations, publication of business reports, procedures for suspension of operations and liquidation, approval for capital increases, reorganizations, and the establishment of branch banks, and penalties for violations. However, this law was never implemented, and the old Banking Law focused on commercial banks. Therefore, on July 4 of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the National Government also promulgated the Savings Bank Law. After the War of Resistance, in order to adapt to the wartime environment and meet the needs of the war, the Ministry of Finance promulgated ten articles of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Banks during the Emergency Period" in August of the 29th year of the Republic (1940). In December of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the Ministry of Finance, recognizing the need for further management of silver houses and money shops, supplemented and revised the previously promulgated measures to 15 articles, which were promulgated and implemented on December 9. Since then, all silver houses and money shops in the country, from operations to profit distribution, from institutions to employees, from branches to trade associations, have been separately regulated and strictly controlled. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, there were no major financial fluctuations in the rear, and the government's control contributed to this. After the restoration, the social situation changed, and the economy returned to peacetime. The Legislative Yuan was ordered to reorganize the Banking Law. Over the course of a year, it was revised seven times, and it was finally decided by the Finance and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan on April 12 of this year, and then discussed in detail at the Sixth Court Assembly, completing the first reading on the 17th. Subsequently, the Silver Industry Association and the Shanghai Money Shop Association put forward a number of opinions, requesting adoption. After accepting the opinions of the private sector, the Legislative Yuan finally passed the third reading on April 24, and it will soon be promulgated and implemented by the National Government.

The new Banking Law consists of ten chapters and 119 articles, covering the organization of banks, the definition of operations, the general principles and penalties that apply, and the registration and licensing of banks. The operations of banks, trust companies, money shops, and foreign banks, as well as the management they should be subject to, are listed in separate chapters. From a legislative technique perspective, the Banking Law can be said to be a meticulously structured law by the Legislative Yuan, and the most complete code in commercial law. From a legislative spirit perspective, the enactment of the Banking Law creates a new era for China's banking science and banking industry system. It not only implements passive management of banks, but also actively guides the use of funds and the safe and stable direction of operations, in line with national financial policies, and promotes the healthy development of banking operations. This is indeed very different from the spirit of past laws and regulations. The important principles and spirit are evaluated as follows:

(1) Banks are essentially a type of company, so the Banking Law stipulates that the procedures for the organization system, business registration, and application for licensing of banks shall follow the provisions of the Company Law. In this sense, the Banking Law can be said to be a subsidiary law of the Company Law. The Banking Law adopts an equal spirit for commercial banks, industrial banks, savings banks, trust companies, and money shops, and generally regards them as banks. Companies and firms engaged in banking operations are also regarded as banks and must be registered in accordance with the law, and their activities are subject to legal regulation. This has a major significance in stabilizing social finance.

(2) In the past, the government's management of banks focused on ex-post inspection or inspection during the course of operations. The Banking Law has a guiding nature for the development of banking operations, so various banks are categorized and operate according to their respective types. Both deposits and loans are subject to substantive regulations. Banks enjoy rights in accordance with the law, and banks fulfill obligations in accordance with the law, fairly and impartially, which truly has the spirit of banking professionalism.

(3) Commercial banks focus on flexibility, industrial banks focus on stability, savings banks focus on the safety of depositors, trust companies focus on adhering to contracts, and money shops focus on customs, and give priority to developing into the banking industry. Each type of bank has its own professionalism. Branches and sub-branches cannot be set up freely and must pay attention to local needs. Therefore, branches must be established in response to needs and not for their own convenience. This is beneficial to the national and local economic development.

(4) In order to protect financial stability and social security, the reserve funds of banks should be deposited in the bank's vault or in national banks in accordance with legal ratios. Banks should store guarantee reserve funds in accordance with legal ratios for the deposits they receive and should not illegally withdraw them. This not only protects the rights and interests of depositors but also eliminates illegal speculation by banks. Therefore, the Banking Law does not control the activities of banks in advance or afterward, but only makes legislative prevention. At the same time, Article 44 further stipulates that "In order to protect the interests of depositors, banks should jointly establish a deposit insurance organization." All of this is to prevent risks in advance. It is expected that the credit of banks will be very strong in the future.

(5) The Banking Law also has provisions for personnel. Bank executives or employees shall not make credit loans in any way, and shall not accept commissions from depositors or lenders. Violators will be punished. This is to promote the spirit of public service and law-abiding among bank employees. If it can be effectively implemented, it will be sufficient to improve work efficiency and rectify and prevent the occurrence of private harm to public affairs. This personnel regulation is of great importance, and the competent authorities should have strict ex-post inspections in order to be successful.

(6) The Banking Law also has an important feature, that is, the establishment, registration, and special privileges of foreign banks in China, and the use of funds are listed in special chapters. At the same time, it stipulates that foreign banks in China shall limit their receipts and payments to Chinese currency, which is a management system that independent countries should have. The spirit of this system is extremely reasonable and needs no further explanation.

The above comments are only a brief summary. The Banking Law is logically correct and the measures are detailed. We should have a good evaluation. It is hoped that after the National Government promulgates and implements it, the competent authorities will take administrative measures in accordance with the law and put the banking industry on the right track. This is beneficial to public rights, social security, and financial stability. It is hoped that it will be implemented as soon as possible!

The President and General Marshall then drove to the White House for dinner together. General Marshall then took a plane to Pinehurst City, North Carolina to meet his wife, and will return to Washington tomorrow to attend an important meeting convened by President Truman. Leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties, cabinet members, and senior State Department officials will attend the meeting. General Marshall will not issue any other statements before his broadcast speech on the evening of the 28th of this month.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and congressional leaders will meet tonight at the White House to hear Secretary Marshall's report on his trip to Moscow. What congressional leaders are most concerned about is Stalin's views on the Truman Doctrine, as expressed to Secretary Marshall. Stalin's reaction may determine the next step in the US government's plan to provide assistance to countries threatened by communism. In addition to Greece and Turkey, Korea, Iran, Iraq, India, and Egypt have or will request US assistance. The White House and Congress are preparing to establish institutions to study the necessary steps and the funds required. Unofficial estimates put the total cost of assistance at $5 billion. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote next Wednesday on the establishment of a committee to continue studying the proposed aid requests. General Marshall's first administrative measure after returning to the country will be to establish a design bureau, headed by Kennan, a leading expert on Soviet affairs. After the results of Marshall's meeting with Stalin are presented to congressional leaders, if it is proven that the United States still needs to provide assistance to other countries, President Truman is prepared to send another message to Congress, proposing a plan to assist countries other than Greece and Turkey. The State Department is studying a plan to assist Korea. Unofficial estimates put the amount of assistance at $540 million, to be paid in three installments. In addition, indirect assistance that can reduce the economic burden on Britain and France is also under discussion. The failure of the Moscow Conference will further deepen the rift between the eastern and western parts of Germany. Due to Molotov's rejection of France's demands for the Saar region, France's likelihood of joining the Anglo-American zone in Germany has increased compared to before. If so, the huge occupation costs borne by Britain and France may be partially shared by the United States.

### Total Value of US Foreign Aid Reaches $15.5 Billion

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The Office of the Budget has just released the total value of civilian foreign aid approved or prepared to be approved by the United States since the end of World War II, totaling $15.567 billion, excluding military aid. The aid items are as follows:

(1) Loans to the UK of $3.75 billion, to be repaid in installments over 50 years. (2) Direct allocation of surplus materials for civilian relief, $824 million. (3) Relief plans for the occupied areas of Japan, Korea, Germany, and Austria, totaling $1.45 billion. (4) Export-Import Bank loans to foreign countries of $2.0117 billion, to be repaid in installments over 30 years. (5) Transfer of surplus materials, estimated at $1.03 billion. (6) Aid under the Post-War Lend-Lease Act, valued at $1.848 billion. (7) Sale of ships, $107 million. (8) Aid to the Philippines, $695 million, of which only a portion will be repaid in the future. (9) Aid through international organizations such as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), $2.617 billion. (10) Post-UNRRA foreign aid, $350 million. (11) International Bank shares, $635 million. (12) International Refugee Organization fund, $75 million. (13) Aid to Greece, $150 million (excluding military aid).

In addition, contributions of $2.75 billion to the International Monetary Fund to stabilize the currencies of other countries are not included in the scope of relief.

### US to Lend $20 Million to Hungary

[Agence France-Presse, Hungarian Capital, 26th] According to reliable sources: the United States is about to announce a loan of $21 million to Hungary. This loan is different from the previous two loans (totaling $15 million), not only can it be used by the Hungarian government to purchase US surplus materials within Europe, but it can also be used to purchase US goods (what kind of US goods are still unknown). This loan is also unrelated to the $7 million loan granted by two US private banks to Hungary for the purchase of cotton textiles. According to Hungarian sources today, this loan was not requested by the Hungarian government from the United States. It is also reported that this loan is not within the scope of the $350 million that the United States intends to use to assist countries such as Poland and Hungary.

### US State Department Expenses Increase Tenfold

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The US diplomatic community, like ordinary housewives, is also hit by rising living costs. The State Department's expenses are currently ten times higher than in 1939, and are still increasing. Rising prices, salary adjustments, and the United States' leading position in international affairs have all made the State Department's expenses increasingly large. According to statistics, the State Department's expenses in 1939 were only $17.122 million, at which time there were a total of 5,261 civil servants, while the current number of State Department personnel has reached 21,000, and its expenses can be imagined. It is difficult to predict when the increase in US diplomatic expenses can stop, and it depends on future international relations.

### Turkish Cabinet Meeting Discusses US Aid to Turkey

[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 26th] Regarding US aid to Turkey, it is reported that the Turkish cabinet has been meeting for days to discuss the matter. After the US Ambassador to Turkey, Wilson, returns here from the United States next week, the Turkish government will conduct negotiations with him.

### Canadian Prime Minister Expresses Disappointment with the Moscow Conference

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 26th] Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King returned to the country from the United States today. According to him, he expressed disappointment with the Moscow Conference, but hoped that it would facilitate future continued negotiations, as Marshall hoped.

### Rumors that the Four Powers Have Secretly Decided on Yugoslavia's Demands on Austria

[United Press, Vienna, 26th] The Deputy Minister of Property Management and Economic Planning of Austria said today when he returned here from Moscow: The Austrian delegation believes that Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Carinthia have been decided by the four foreign ministers in a secret meeting. The Austrian delegation was led by Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber, who told reporters upon arrival here that he could not make any statements to the press before discussing with Austrian Prime Minister Figl. In explaining the US position on the issue of German assets in Austria, he denied that the United States had rejected the Soviet compromise plan, which had been called acceptable to Austria. He also said: The Austrian government is willing to return 81 enterprises in eastern Austria to the Soviet Union, as long as the operation of these enterprises complies with Austrian law.

### Austrian Foreign Minister Comments on the Outcome of the Moscow Conference

[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 26th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber, who recently returned here from Moscow, gave a radio address tonight commenting on the outcome of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, saying in brief: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has made considerable progress, and the procedures it has formulated can enable the drafting of the peace treaty to be handled quickly. From a practical point of view, we have no reason to express dissatisfaction with the Foreign Ministers Conference, but from a psychological point of view, it is not. The way the Foreign Ministers Conference handled the Austrian issue completely violated Austria's desire to become a free and independent country, and a free Austria will not rely on the policies of the Allied countries, nor will it be willing to rely on the policies of the Allied countries to be reborn.

### United Nations Special Assembly Opens: Discussions on the Palestine Issue, Brazilian Representative Expected to Assume Chairmanship

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 27th] The United Nations Special Assembly will open tomorrow to discuss the Palestine issue. The chief representative of Brazil, Oswaldo, is expected to assume the chairmanship, succeeding the head of the Belgian delegation, Spaak. It is reported that the five major powers and the Secretary-General of the United Nations have approved this proposal. Simultaneously, the Assembly must also elect seven vice-chairmen. The five major powers are ex-officio vice-chairmen, with the addition of one vice-chairman from either the Philippines or India and one vice-chairman from a South American country. The sixth and seventh vice-chairmen will replace the previous vice-chairmen from the Union of South Africa and Venezuela. The Executive Committee of the Assembly will also be renewed, comprising Canada, Sweden, Egypt, Czechoslovakia, and Mexico, replacing the previous Uruguay, Ukraine, Syria, Panama, and New Zealand, with only Poland retaining its seat. The Assembly is expected to last three or four weeks.

[Associated Press, New York, 26th] The United Nations Special Assembly on the Palestine issue is scheduled to open on the 28th. Britain and other major powers may be forced to express their positions. Britain and the United States are prepared to insist that the agenda of the Special Assembly be limited to discussing the organization of the investigation committee. However, some representatives will certainly raise other difficult issues. The Polish delegation insists that Britain and the other four major powers should be included in any special committee. Poland's position, which sometimes reflects the attitude of the Soviet Union, is noteworthy.

Soviet Attitude Particularly Noteworthy

[Reuters, Lake Success, 26th] Observers expect the Soviet Union to support the demand for Palestine's independence during the United Nations Special General Assembly's discussion of the Palestine issue. However, to date, the Soviet Union has not indicated whether it will support the Jewish or Arab faction. Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Novikov, stated in the Trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly last November that the Soviet Union believed Palestine should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations or achieve independence. Now that the Soviet Union has boycotted the Trusteeship Council, it is expected that it will no longer mention trusteeship in the Special General Assembly but will instead advocate Palestine's independence. Novikov stated last November that Britain had granted independence to Transjordan, so why not grant independence to Palestine? According to people close to the Soviet representatives, the Soviet Union still opposes the formal demands of the Zionist movement. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has great interests in the oil resources and strategic location of the Middle East, and it also has a large Muslim population domestically. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet Union may support the Arab faction rather than the Zionist movement, which is controlled by American capitalists. It is expected that in the Special General Assembly, the Soviet Union will demand Palestine's independence and the establishment of a proportional representative government for both Arabs and Jews, which would mean Palestine would be ruled by the Arab majority. Recently, Soviet Representative Gromyko and Syrian Representative Khoury expressed mutual support in the Security Council, thus revealing the Soviet Union's inclination on the Palestine issue.

Indian Support for Arab Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 26th] The Deputy Prime Minister of the Indian Interim Government, Nehru, and the President of the Muslim League, Jinnah, have notified the Arab League that the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League fully agree with the policies adopted by the Arab countries in Palestine and will support the discussion of the Palestine issue at the United Nations General Assembly.

### Thailand's Accession Ceremony Held Today at the United Nations

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 26th, United Press] The ceremony for admitting Thailand to the United Nations will be held on the 28th of this month during the special session of the United Nations General Assembly convened to discuss the Palestine issue. It was approved near the close of the 1946 General Assembly. The same assembly also approved the admission of Sweden, Iceland, and Afghanistan.

### Austin's Speech: Advocates a Firm and Calm Stance Towards the Soviet Union

[United Press, Cleveland, 26th] The United States Representative to the United Nations, Austin, delivered a speech at the International Conference of Railway Workers today, demanding that the United States continue to adopt a firm and calm attitude in dealing with the Soviet Union. Austin stated that this is the only way to go. The control of atomic energy should have the possibility of achieving an effective organization. Austin predicted that an agreement with the Soviet Union on this matter would be reached "soon." The United States has a great influence on the United Nations' decision on whether peace must be achieved. He also listed the following policies that the United States must adopt to promote collective security: (1) Fully uphold the United Nations Charter, resorting to force when necessary; (2) Utilize the coordination steps already established by the United Nations; (3) Assist countries devastated by war to restore their economic strength; (4) The United States must abandon any unilateral disarmament plan "caused by malice, hoping to reduce our budget."

### Clark to Return to the United States Soon: To Assume Important Post as Commander of the Sixth Army; Keyes Succeeds as U.S. Commissioner to Austria

[United Press, Vienna, 26th] The Commander of the U.S. Forces in Austria, General Clark, stated today during a reception for reporters that the failure of the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference will not change his plan to return to the United States to assume the post of Commander of the Sixth Army.

[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 26th] The U.S. High Commissioner to Austria, General Clark, is scheduled to depart for his home country on May 17th and will assume an important post on the Pacific coast. According to his announcement to the press today, his position as High Commissioner to Austria will be succeeded by General Keyes. He also stated that he could not represent the United States at the Four Powers Commission to be held in Vienna on May 12 to discuss the Austrian peace treaty. Who will represent the United States in the future will depend on the appointment of Secretary of State Marshall. In addition, in response to reporters' questions, he said that the U.S. troops will only withdraw when other countries can also withdraw from Austria.

### Conservative Party Dissatisfied with Government: British Political Situation Becomes Tense; Cabinet to Undergo Partial Reorganization Soon

[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] Political figures here have recently stated that the British Labour Cabinet will carry out a partial reorganization before the Labour Party holds its annual conference, which is almost certain. This matter will be discussed by Prime Minister Attlee, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Lord President of the Council Morrison next week. The situation created by the failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to achieve any concrete results will also be discussed.

[Associated Press, London, 26th] The government's counterattack against the Conservative Party's criticism today is rapidly evolving into a political war. Attorney General Wike and Fuel Minister Shinwell each delivered speeches, following the new approach adopted by Prime Minister Attlee yesterday, refuting Churchill personally and his Conservative Party. At the same time, Churchill wrote to the by-election candidates again condemning the current government's "squandering and mismanagement." Liberal Party President Houlden demanded that the party join forces with the Conservative Party to oust the Labour Party. The degree of political animosity is intensifying, and the Conservative Party is consolidating its financial strength, drafting new policy statements, and actively planning a speaking campaign to win over comrades. A key Labour official stated that the government has begun a "massive" speaking campaign against the Conservative Party and is prepared to respond to its criticisms "sternly." Government ministers have previously made public speeches, doing their best to explain socialist policies and the need for the entire nation to work hard to revitalize the economy after the war. Now, they have shifted their focus to engaging in direct attacks and defenses. Many ministers, provoked by the criticisms of the Conservative Party, feel the need to respond.

### Conservative Party Plans Completed: Industrial Plan

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The Sunday Times reported today that the British Conservative Party will soon publish its industrial plan, which is 1,000 pages long. It reviews short-term and long-term plans and will include several proposals for cooperation between state-owned and private enterprises. The issue of wages is also discussed. This plan will oppose the Labour government's nationalization policy.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] A by-election was held in Wroxton today. Former Prime Minister Churchill wrote to the Conservative candidate, severely criticizing the Labour Party for providing unachievable promises. "After six years of war, many people have forgotten the failures of the previous Labour cabinet, and many people are too young to remember. Therefore, they have been influenced by the Labour Party's promises and support the Labour Party's rule."

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 27th] MacArthur issued a message tonight, stating that the results of the general election in Japan have shown that the Japanese people firmly reject the leadership of the Communist Party. MacArthur's message was released through the General Headquarters Press Office.

Free Vote Reflects Public Opinion

It stated that in this election, millions of Japanese people, from factories, shops, and homes, from rural farms and railway districts, went to the polls to fulfill their new civic obligations without fear and voted freely. The basic question for the voters was to choose a political concept. The extreme right-wing totalitarianism, responsible for defeat and long-term oppression of civil rights, has been abandoned by the people. The extreme left-wing communist ideology still exists, and its leaders have tried their best to win public support. Since the beginning of the occupation, thousands of Communists have been released. This ideology (communism and its leaders) has been given the greatest freedom of political action, allowing for fair and open competition with democratic forces and beliefs. However, under the people's consideration, it has failed. The Japanese people firmly reject the leadership of the Communist Party and have overwhelmingly chosen the middle path, staying away from the two extremes, to ensure the preservation of freedom and the promotion of individual dignity.

Implementing the New Constitution Opens the Way

The national election has opened the way for the implementation of Japan's progressive new constitution, which is "one of the great spiritual movements" of mankind, enough to indicate "a new era in the Far East and to give the Japanese people another opportunity." The Japanese people have moved from slavery to a free life, "I believe they will not fail their new obligations." The Japanese people, with a cautious and sincere attitude, followed the rules and freely voted to elect candidates, and no one can object to them. This election is unprecedented in Japan's history, reflecting the free will of the majority of the people, rather than a few people acting arbitrarily and unilaterally. This is what democracy means. With the election having been held, the final preparatory steps necessary for the implementation of Japan's new constitution have been completed.

### Final Results of the Japanese General Election Announced: MacArthur Issues Special Message Emphasizing that the Communist Party Is Not Popular with the People; Japan's First Democratic Cabinet Likely to Be a Coalition Cabinet

[Asia East News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] As a result of this general election of members of the House of Representatives in Japan, the Socialist Party became the largest party, while the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party retreated to the second and third positions, respectively. Therefore, at the first Diet session to be convened on May 20, the political center will likely be based on the Socialist Party's Chairman Katayama, and Japan will establish a regime guided by a progressive socialist party. However, the Socialist Party, together with its left-wing party (the Communist Party), still cannot control an absolute majority of seats in the Diet. Therefore, it must seek cooperation with other political parties. As for the future trend of dealing with the situation, it will be (1) a coalition cabinet formed by the Socialist Party at the center, with the cooperation of the Social Democratic, Liberal, and National Cooperative parties; (2) a conservative cabinet formed by the cooperation of the Liberal Democratic and Conservative parties; (3) a coalition cabinet formed by the Socialist Party alone cooperating with the Liberal Party or the Democratic Party. Furthermore, after learning the results of the election, Socialist Party Chairman Katayama emphasized the theory of a coalition cabinet on the 26th, which suggests that the first democratic cabinet will soon be a coalition cabinet.

[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] The Social Democratic Party members elected by the Japanese people to the first Diet, totaling 143, laid the foundation for a coalition government today. According to the new constitution, the coalition government must include socialists. The Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Yoshida has lost the largest number of seats, occupying only 133 seats. The Democratic Party led by Vice-Prime Minister Shidehara is third, occupying 126 seats. The number of seats for each party is listed below: Social Democratic Party 143 seats, Liberal Party 133 seats, Democratic Party 126 seats, National Cooperative Party (Conservative) 31 seats, Communist Party 4 seats, Minor Parties 16 seats, Independents 13 seats. There are only 14 female members in this session, 25 fewer than in the previous Diet.

### Syngman Rhee Discusses the Political Situation in Korea

Plans to Propose Establishing an Independent Government

[Associated Press, Seoul, 26th] The leader of the Korean Democratic Party, Syngman Rhee, recently returned here from the United States. Today, he denied the statement in his talks reported by newspapers in Shanghai that President Truman had guaranteed a $600 million loan to Korea. It is reported that "Mr. Truman never guaranteed anything to me. I did not even meet with [him] during my recent trip to the United States. In my talks in Shanghai, I only said that the U.S. government is considering assisting the Korean people. If such assistance is realized, we would be happy to accept it." When discussing the Korean political situation, Rhee said that he would propose the establishment of a government to prevent negotiations by the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission from failing in the future, so that this government could negotiate with the Soviet Union. Rhee plans to urge the Provisional Assembly of South Korea to pass an election law to elect a congress or parliament. This body would formulate a constitution as the basis for an independent government in North or South Korea. If the negotiations by the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission on the unification of Korea fail, the Koreans will advance the plan for an independent government. If the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate, the Korean government can appeal to the United Nations.

### Wallace Returns to the United States

Will Launch a National "Peace Movement"

[United Press, New York, 27th] Wallace, who has been the most vocal critic of U.S. foreign policy, flew into LaGuardia Airport here today with the firm belief that his two-week "peace tour" in Europe was successful. Wallace said, "My trip to Europe was not to overthrow the Truman Doctrine, but to find out what kind of forces Europe is organizing after the path of peace. I feel that the people of Britain, Western Europe, and Scandinavia are good and enthusiastic people. Even more, they all unanimously hope for peace." Wallace also said that he planned to go to Washington today to launch a national "peace movement" and host a press conference on the afternoon of the 28th. He has decided to deliver speeches in New York and Chicago, and another speech in Los Angeles regarding the use of the "Hollywood Bowl" music venue.

### Chairman of the U.S. Senate Military Committee Condemns U.S. Military's Lack of Preparedness

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] The Chairman of the Senate Military Committee, Gurney, delivered a radio address yesterday, condemning the U.S. military's lack of preparedness to deal with any emergency in the occupied areas around the world. He stated: If we were to face a major crisis tomorrow, the U.S. troops in the occupied areas would certainly be overwhelmed by a major power. The United States now has neither troops that can be deployed to deal with major emergencies nor troops that can prevent them. Because the United States can only muster 300,000 people, and most of the one million soldiers are scattered in the occupied areas, undertaking their occupation or management tasks.

He also described the imaginary scenario of the United States encountering a military attack in the future, believing that the greatest danger lies in internal sabotage and long-range aerial bombing. Long-range bombers and rocket bombs can deal a fatal blow to the United States' major industries. This would be the initial offensive once a war breaks out. What follows could be the invasion of the United States by paratroopers and the full-scale frontal offensive of the army.

### American Industrial Areas to Implement Evacuation

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The U.S. Congress is considering a bill that would lay the foundation for the re-designation and evacuation of industrial areas as a national defense measure.

### Britain and Poland Conclude Trade Agreement

The agreement stipulates that Poland will ship goods worth approximately 23 million pounds and 250,000 tons of coal to Britain. The goods are mostly food, and the coal is for use by British ships in the Baltic Sea. Britain will supply Poland with goods worth 35 million pounds, most of which are machinery.

### Indian Constituent Assembly Convenes Third Meeting

[Our Newspaper News] London, 27th Broadcast: The Indian Constituent Assembly will convene its third meeting on Monday. The Muslim League and most tribes are still refusing to participate, causing the hope of Indian constitution-making to fade. It is reported that the result of the talks between Muslim League leader Jinnah and Mountbatten is still a firm demand for the separation of India and Pakistan.

### Wei Lihuang Leaves the United States for Britain

To Inspect British and French Military Equipment

[United Press, New York, 26th] General Wei Lihuang left the United States for London by plane on the 26th to visit the military equipment of Britain and France. General Wei has been studying military affairs in the United States for several months and has now completed his research. He said that the Chinese army plans to adopt the best characteristics of the military systems of Britain, the United States, and France. General Wei is accompanied by his wife, daughter, and staff.

### Hungary Applies to Join the United Nations

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 26th] It has just been learned that the Hungarian government, through its ambassador to the United States, sent a note to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the 22nd of this month, applying to join the United Nations as a member state.

### Prehistoric Skull Discovered in South Africa

[Agence France-Presse, Cape Town, South Africa, 26th] Archaeologist Dr. Broom of the Pretoria Museum recently discovered a prehistoric human skull in a cave in the Outer Transvaal Province, which confirms that humans evolved from apes. The doctor identified the bone as belonging to a 50-year-old woman, with a volume of 400 cubic centimeters.

### British Newspaper Advises Britain and the United States to Abandon the Spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and Implement Alert on the Elbe River

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The "Observer" newspaper commented on the failure of the Moscow Conference, concluding that Britain and the United States should abandon the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, implement alert work on the Elbe River to make it a barrier against the communist tide, and conclude an agreement with the United States to keep Western Germany stable and self-sufficient. It stated: The merger of the British and American occupation zones has failed, and we should no longer miss the opportunity. To date, there are no real signs of economic recovery in the two occupation zones, and the food situation is extremely chaotic. The two sides have very different opinions on how to deal with this matter. Now, to solve this difficulty, it is urgent to restore the trade links between the Ruhr area, the Netherlands, and France. If we do not abandon the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and get rid of its restrictions and constraints, this policy will still have no hope of success. Now that the Moscow Conference has declared its failure, and the Soviet Union has refused to lift the four-power agreement on the disarmament of Germany, the ideological front in Germany has become clear, as if the northern border of Greece and Turkey has become an important weak point. It is important to know that hunger and disaster are the easiest places for communist propaganda to grow. Now that the United States is resisting the infiltration and aggression of communism around the world, it should not neglect to implement alert on the Elbe River.

### Current State of U.S.-Soviet Relations

Special Translation by the Newspaper Compilation Office

The relationship between the two most powerful nations in the world has now reached a new historical stage, a stage where they openly declare mutual suspicion. How things will evolve in the future can only be speculated, and no definite predictions can be made.

The United States believes that the Soviet Union's expansionist and aggressive policies have reached a point where a showdown is necessary. The United States is prepared to use dollars, armaments, and troops as a backing for upholding democracy and opposing totalitarianism. The unwavering U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union has already materialized in Greece and Turkey.

After Britain announced that its aid to Greece and Turkey would have to be greatly reduced starting at the end of March, President Truman immediately requested Congress to lend 400 million yuan to Greece and Turkey as relief. At the same time, the new U.S. policy must be implemented no later than March 31st. Congressional leaders unanimously agreed that by that time, a legal resolution should be established in response to President Truman's request.

The United States is Prepared to Take Action

The new situation of U.S.-Soviet antagonism has broken through American tradition and caused a drastic change in U.S.-Soviet relations. Truman said that mere speeches and diplomatic protests are no longer sufficient to protect democracy against aggressive forces, and that the United States now needs to take action. Truman meant that wherever the Soviet Union attempts to impose totalitarianism on other countries, the United States will take action there.

Truman's message to Congress did not call for a change in relations with the Soviet Union. President Truman did not mention the word "Soviet Union" in his speech. He only spoke of aggressors, but did not name them. At the same time, as far as the United States is concerned, it has always adhered to diplomatic etiquette. The Soviet Union has recalled its ambassadors stationed in Washington, London, and Paris for instructions, but declared that this action is temporary. The United States did not recall its ambassador to Moscow, and the U.S. representatives in the United Nations and the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers continue to negotiate with the Soviet representatives as usual. Superficially, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov continue to hold talks as if nothing had happened in Washington.

The intention of the United States is obviously to maintain normal U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations, without resorting to force, and without any implication of declaring war or severing ties. The United States intends to inform the Soviet Union that the United States is now prepared to use its resources to contain Soviet expansion and the spread of communism. Truman's speech was deliberately straightforward, concise, and clear, so that people could understand it at a glance, hoping that this candid statement could avoid the need for confrontation. In the past, some people doubted the foreign policy of the United States, but now that doubt has completely dissipated.

U.S.-Soviet Suspicion Becomes Overt

At the same time, diplomatic subtleties cannot conceal the suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding each other's intentions. The Greek issue is only a prelude to the United States' suspicion manifesting itself and the United States taking action.

The Hungarian issue did not attract as much attention as the Greek issue, because the United States has not yet mentioned taking action. However, the United States has lodged a serious protest against the Soviet Union's intention to force Hungary to establish a communist government.

Other issues, such as Soviet actions in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Iran, France, Italy, Sweden, Norway, and the Far East, have also aroused protests from the United States. The development of communism in Latin America has aroused the vigilance of the United States. In addition, in former enemy countries where U.S. and Soviet troops are facing each other, mutual suspicion is increasing day by day.

The Soviet Union's suspicion of capitalist America has been around for a long time and is now even more intense. According to Marx's definition, capitalist countries are bound to be aggressive, imperialistic, and creators of war. Such accusations from Moscow Radio were temporarily quieted during the war, but now they have returned to their old ways.

Soviet Newspapers Criticize Aid to Greece and Turkey

The Soviet Union's first reaction to Truman's speech was that the Soviet government's official newspaper, "Izvestia," compared the new U.S. policy to Hitler's policy. The newspaper accused Truman of using the same tactics as Hitler when he was about to seize a country in his words of requesting Congress to aid Greece and Turkey against the forces of violence.

Regarding the U.S. aid to the Chinese Nationalist government, the Soviet Union believes that it violates the interests of the Chinese people, so Molotov requested that the Chinese issue be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers for discussion.

In fact, as the United States sees it, Molotov's proposal is more related to Greece than to China. Molotov's proposal came before Truman's speech to Congress. He believed that Moscow's raising of the issue of China's civil war might make U.S. congressmen aware that the United States cannot promote China's unity and stability. Perhaps Molotov also believed that Marshall was the decision-maker of U.S. policy toward China. Therefore, Molotov hoped to spark debate on the Chinese issue in order to put Marshall in a difficult position, force the United States to take a defensive position in the Moscow conference, and sow seeds of doubt in the minds of congressmen who were about to decide on the issue of aid to Greece.

In Moscow, Molotov's strategy on the China issue and the discussion on the German issue were overshadowed by Truman's declaration of a new U.S. policy. Whether the news from Washington will strengthen or alleviate Soviet resistance is only known to the Soviet Union itself. Perhaps an answer can be found in the negotiations on the German and Austrian issues.

In the eyes of Americans, Germany is only one end of many conflicts between communist Soviet Union and capitalist United States, the fundamental conflict still lies in the United States and the Soviet Union themselves. Whether the United States and the Soviet Union can reconcile their conflicts has become a matter of the greatest concern to governments around the world. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly).

### Twenty Japanese War Criminals and Traitors Extradited from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday - One War Criminal Committed Suicide by Jumping into the Sea En Route Out of Fear of Punishment

Six important Japanese war criminals and fourteen traitors who fled to Japan after the victory were extradited for interrogation after negotiations between our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan. They were escorted by U.S. military police to Taiwan, and then by 12 military police officers led by Lieutenant Platoon Leader Lai Yongming of the 4th Regiment of the Taiwan Military Police on the "Zhongxing" ship to Shanghai, arriving at the Zhongxing Wharf in Pudong at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. After receiving a telegram from the Taiwan Garrison Command, the Songhu Garrison Command had already dispatched Major Adjutant Ji Guohuang and ten soldiers to wait at the wharf. The war criminals and traitors disembarked one after another, with their heads bowed and speechless, as if they were overwhelmed by the contrast between the past and the present. The prisoners were then escorted onto the "Huadao" ship and arrived at Dongjia Wharf at 12:30 p.m., where they were taken by two prison cars to the Military Court of the First Pacification Zone. As it was Sunday yesterday, no one was on duty, so they were taken to the Shanghai High Court. The court accepted the fourteen traitors and detained them in the detention center. The six war criminals were temporarily detained in the garrison command detention center and will be transferred to the military court this morning.

Full List of Prisoners

The list of the six war criminals is as follows: Ryozo Fukuda, Navy Vice Admiral, former Commander of the Japanese Navy Fleet, with the Izumo warship as its flagship. Akira Nara, Army Lieutenant General, former Commander of the Hankou Dispatch Army. Kazuo Shirakawa, former diplomat stationed in "Manchukuo." Sadajiro Katsura, former consultant to the Kailuan Mining and Metallurgical Bureau. Hideomi Takahashi, Warrant Officer, formerly Colonel Masao Misaki. The list of the fourteen traitors is as follows: Qikang Bao, Shantong Chen, Guorui Fu, Qiguang Xie, Xiangliang Kong, Shanghuang Kang, Wenxiu Lin, Guoying Mi, Shukai Deng, Naihou Cao, Baozheng Wu, Xueting Ye, Dingjun Zeng, Hongjie Jiang.

It is also learned that the U.S. military police originally escorted seven Japanese war criminals from Japan to Taiwan by ship, but when the ship passed the waters of Ryukyu, one war criminal took advantage of the unpreparedness of the crowd and suddenly jumped into the sea and committed suicide. His name is not yet known.

### Families of Officers and Soldiers Who Died in the Fubo Gunboat Disaster Held a Press Conference Yesterday to Report and Appeal

[Report from this newspaper] Wang Hangmanjun, Zhu Cai Xiuzhang, Chen Cheng Lixia and other family members of officers and soldiers who died in the Fubo gunboat disaster held a press conference at the Civil Affairs Bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday and issued a written report, which is recorded as follows: Regarding the case of the Fubo warship being sunk by the China Merchants Bureau's Haimin ship, there have been continuous reports and comments in newspapers recently. We, the family members of the officers on the ship, are the direct relatives of the victims in this case. Although we are in extreme sorrow and grief, we are determined not to express our opinions publicly until the case is clarified. After more than a month of running around and inquiring, and after reading the indictment issued by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate against Dai Rulin, the captain of the Haimin ship, we believe that the facts of the case have become extremely clear. At this moment, there are various rumors, all with ulterior motives, hoping to confuse public opinion. At the same time, in today's society, money can still communicate with the gods, which is still unavoidable. We have already seen various signs and cannot help but feel the absurdity of the world. Fortunately, the public trial of this case is imminent, so we extend several meanings and urge public opinion to supervise the progress of this case and ensure a fair result:

Sinking the Fubo, Continuing to Move Forward

(1) Dai Rulin, the captain of the Haimin ship, admitted in the Shanghai Local Procuratorate's examination court that after the collision, the ship stopped for only a few minutes and continued to move forward. This point has already been stated in the indictment issued by the Local Procuratorate. Further evidence from the passengers of the Haimin ship is conclusive. At that time, the officers and soldiers of the "Fubo" were waiting for rescue in the water, but the Haimin ship moved forward, and the push plate agitated the waves even more, causing hundreds of navy officers and soldiers to be drowned. This point alone is enough to constitute Dai Rulin's crime under Article 128 of the Maritime Commerce Law.

Life-Saving Equipment, Mostly Not Used

(2) The Haimin ship attempted to escape after colliding with the Fubo, and only returned to rescue after being criticized by the passengers. It took several hours to go back and forth. When they met Mr. Jiao Dexiao, the engineer of the "Fubo," they did not provide effective rescue. At that time, the passengers on the customs ship were filled with anger and, in addition to blaming Captain Dai Rulin, they also encouraged the sailor Ma Fugen to go into the water to rescue him, fortunately saving Mr. Jiao Dexiao, the only survivor. There is already written proof of this from the testifying passengers. Furthermore, the Local Procuratorate inspected the Haimin ship and found that its life-saving equipment, except for two lifebuoys and two life rafts that were thrown into the sea at ordinary times, was not used at all. Moreover, when the lifebuoys and life rafts were thrown down, they were not tied with ropes, or they were tied too tightly (as testified by passengers). The captain of the China Merchants Bureau ship clearly had the intention of killing and destroying evidence, and he should undoubtedly be subject to the sanctions stipulated in Article 271 of the Criminal Law to serve as a warning to others.

Failure to Rescue, Difficult to Cover Up Guilt

(3) The responsibility for the collision and Dai Rulin's failure to rescue are two completely different matters and cannot be confused. There will be a day when the responsibility for the collision is clarified, but Dai Rulin's failure to rescue will certainly still be tried and convicted by the Shanghai Local Court. Today, some people want to cover up the latter with the former, and their intention is very clear. The handling of this case is based on eyewitness testimony, and if the time is delayed for too long, the eyewitness testimony will inevitably be difficult.

Witnesses Will Feel Difficulties

(4) This time, the Shanghai Local Court will hold a public trial of this case on the 29th. When the news was released, the names of the witnesses were listed. This kind of action will cause difficulties for the witnesses. The witnesses are self-standing on the position of justice, but today it is difficult to avoid the influence of evil forces. Before, when the examination court was opened, a few witnesses had been disturbed in various ways, and now it is even more worrying.

(5) As the saying goes, "The Tao is one foot high, and the devil is ten feet high." We ask fair-minded people in society to lend their assistance from the standpoint of justice at any time.

### International Women Lawyers Association, China Branch, Established Yesterday - Creating a New Era in China's Judiciary

[Our Report] The China branch of the International Women Lawyers Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM at the International Hotel Skyscraper. Over a hundred people attended, including Zheng Yuxiu, Qian Jianqiu, Wang Chonghui, Xie Guansheng, Dong XianGuang, Tian Shujun, Tong Daoyun, Yang Minghui, and Zha Liangjian. The meeting was chaired by Zheng Yuxiu, who stated in her brief speech: "The internationalization of women's organizations is an unprecedented event in the judicial field. The success of this association relies on the enthusiastic participation of everyone."

Advocating the Rule of Law, Consolidating Peace

I have two suggestions to offer today: (1) Our constitution has been established, and we must do our utmost to ensure its thorough implementation. We must promote the spirit of the rule of law at all times and in all places so that the country can move towards prosperity. This is the responsibility of us who study law. The main reason for world instability lies in the rule of law. Therefore, to consolidate world peace, we must promote the spirit of the rule of law.

Significant Meaning, Worth Celebrating

Dr. Wang Chonghui then spoke, saying, "The establishment of the China branch of the International Women Lawyers Association marks a new era in China's judiciary. Its significance is very important and worth celebrating. Whether in the international or domestic arena, law has a new trend, which is to be socialized and should be aimed at society. I wish the association success in seeking welfare for society."

Bright Future, Predicting Success

Later, Dong Xianguang expressed that Madame Zheng Yuxiu had lived in the United States with Wei Daoming for many years, and Americans had a very deep impression of her. She is capable in handling affairs and I firmly believe that the association has a bright future.

Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration, rushed from Nanjing to attend, but was delayed due to a train derailment, arriving around 4:00 PM, halfway through. He immediately gave a speech, saying, "The establishment of the China branch of the International Women Lawyers Association is unprecedented in history. I am extremely excited and wish it success."

After passing the association's constitution, the inaugural meeting closed at 4:00 PM. The originally scheduled election of directors and supervisors was changed to a mail-in ballot due to the large number of new members joining on the spot, and will be held at a later date.

### Smooth and Fast - Director Yu Bingjian of the Telecommunications Bureau Broadcasts on the Shanghai Telecommunications Industry - Our Newspaper Holds Its Fourth Weekly Broadcast Yesterday

[Our Report] Our newspaper held its fourth special Sunday broadcast yesterday at the Greater China Continental Radio Station, inviting Mr. Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, to broadcast on "The Telecommunications Industry in Shanghai." The full text of his speech is recorded below:

"The Telecommunications Industry in Shanghai," from a historical perspective, can be divided into four periods: (A) The Budding Period, (B) The Development Period, (C) The War of Resistance Period, (D) The Reconstruction Period.

Budding Period

In the tenth year of Tongzhi in the late Qing Dynasty, about seventy-six years ago, the submarine telegraph line of the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company, passing through Xiamen from Hong Kong to Shanghai, opened for business. Initially, it only accepted foreign language telegrams, but later it created a four-character code for Chinese telegrams. At the same time, the submarine line of the British Great Eastern Telegraph Company ran from Hong Kong to Shanghai. In the sixth year of Guangxu, Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Commerce of the Northern Ports and Governor-General of Zhili, received approval to establish the Tianjin-Shanghai Telegraph, establishing a telegraph bureau. This marked the beginning of Shanghai's state-owned telegraph industry. In the seventh year of Guangxu, the British-owned Duang Kee Foreign Firm established the China-Foreign Telephone Company in the former British Concession. In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, the American Pacific Company extended its underwater line from Manila through Baoyu to Shanghai, setting up a bureau to send and receive telegrams. In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, Germany laid an underwater line from Yap Island to Shanghai. In the thirty-second year of Guangxu, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau also operated the Shanghai Nanshi Zhabei telephone service, establishing the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. This marked the beginning of Shanghai's state-owned telephone industry. In the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, wireless telegraph communication was established between Shanghai and Chongming. In the first year of Xuantong, communication was established between Shanghai and ships at sea. In the second year of the Republic of China, Japan added a submarine line between Shanghai and Nagasaki. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Wusong Wireless Telegraph Bureau was established. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, a broadcasting radio station was established in Shanghai.

Development Period

In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Communications established the Directorate General of Telecommunications in Shanghai. In the seventeenth year, it was merged into the Telecommunications Department, and the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau was designated as a special-class bureau. In the same year, the National Government established a wireless machine manufacturing factory in Shanghai and opened the Shanghai-Nanjing long-distance telephone service. In the seventeenth year, the Ministry of Communications established a telegraph machine manufacturing factory in Shanghai, which was later renamed the Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Factory. In the eighteenth year, the Wireless Radio Management Office was established, making Shanghai the national communication center, establishing shortwave wireless radio stations in various parts of the country, and establishing an international wireless radio station for international communications. In the nineteenth year, the Ministry of Communications established the International Telecommunications Bureau and the Telecommunications Personnel Welfare Association in Shanghai. In the same year, the Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance telephone service opened. In the twenty-fourth year, Shanghai and domestic and foreign countries tested wireless telephone communication.

War of Resistance Period

In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, as the war of resistance moved west, many of Shanghai's telecommunications agencies retreated, merging the Telegraph Bureau, Telephone Bureau, International Radio Station, and the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Underwater Cable Telegraph Offices into the Shanghai Telegraph and Telephone Bureau Storage Office, with myself in charge of Shanghai, starting secret communication work. In the twenty-seventh year, we secretly contacted American businessmen to open three institutions in Shanghai: the American Communications Agency, the Globe Wireless Telegraph Company, and the News Wireless Telegraph Company. It was not until the outbreak of the Pacific War in the winter of the thirtieth year that they were seized by the Japanese, but a few telecommunications personnel remained in Shanghai to continue working at risk.

Reconstruction Period

In June of the thirty-fourth year, I was ordered to establish the Jiangsu Province Jiangnan District Telecommunications Restoration Office in Shanghai as preparation for victory. In August, the Beijing-Shanghai District Telecommunications Receiving Committee was established, and I was ordered to take over the Japanese and puppet telecommunications agencies in Shanghai. After the takeover, we maintained the original communication work and gradually strengthened and improved it. In November of the thirty-fourth year, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau was established, and the initial sorting work was completed. After that, the Telecommunications Personnel Training Institute and the Telecommunications Machinery Repair and Parts Institute were established, all of which are branch institutions under the Telecommunications Bureau.

Victory to Date

It has been almost a year and a half since the victory. This period is a period of initial construction. Due to the simplicity of the machinery, the lack of materials, the difficulty of transportation, and the shortage of talents, we have felt restrained and difficult everywhere. The current telecommunications speed is indeed much more advanced than when we first took over, and it cannot be said that it is not the result of the efforts of the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications, the Bureau, and the telecommunications personnel of various bureaus. At present, wired telegraph, wireless telegraph, wired telephone, and wireless telephone services from Shanghai to various important cities have been opened one after another, and international wireless telephone service is also being tested. According to the recent statistics of the Bureau's business figures, the average monthly number of telegrams to and from is 448,939, an increase of about 1.6 times compared with the 26th year of the Republic. The average monthly number of long-distance telephone calls is 147,860, an increase of about 2.7 times compared with the 26th year of the Republic. In the future, the business figures will continue to rise.

Focus of Work - Pay Attention to Three Points

As for the focus of the Bureau's work in the past year and a half, we have put our efforts into the three points of "accessibility," "smoothness," and "speed" of telecommunications. We strive to make the inaccessible accessible, the accessible smooth, and the smooth fast.

Finally, I would like to specifically present four points to report: (1) Rectify broadcasting stations. (A) Manage the order of the airwaves to avoid disrupting wireless communication. (B) Regulate material resources so that they are not concentrated in one place but can be distributed throughout. (C) Eliminate inferior radio stations to avoid affecting other radio stations. (D) Recover the sovereignty of the broadcasting industry and do not allow foreigners to be superior. At present, there are eighteen stations in this city that have been approved to participate in broadcasting. The Bureau, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Communications, together with the Songhu Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, dispatched personnel to investigate and seal up the remaining unapproved radio stations. It is hoped that the broadcasting industry in Shanghai can be brought into line in a short period of time and complete the government's orders. (2) Regarding the fact that employees and errands still occasionally make illegal demands from the outside world, the Bureau, in addition to strictly prohibiting it, also pays attention to secret investigations at any time. At the same time, we ask all users in the city to give us strong assistance. Whenever the above happens, please pay attention to the symbol or appearance of the person and secretly notify the Bureau or report it to the police for arrest.

Facsimile Telegraph - A Combination of Emotion and Text

(3) I hope that citizens will save on telephone usage. (4) The newly opened facsimile telegraph between Beijing and Shanghai has three benefits: (A) It is very fast and arrives as soon as it is sent. (B) The handwriting is realistic, without fraud or other drawbacks. (C) Using facsimile telegrams for weddings, funerals, and celebrations can have the effect of both emotion and text.

Finally, what I want to talk to you about is that telecommunications aims to serve the people and has a great relationship with society. Although our country's telecommunications industry is now moving towards the road of construction, it is still far from our ideal. I hope that social elites, transportation pioneers, and every citizen will often supervise and contribute opinions at any time to correct our mistakes and supplement our deficiencies, and use the power of the masses to promote this telecommunications industry to gradually reach a bright and great stage.

The Singing Voice is Sweet and the Qin Melody is Resonant - A Perfect Combination

### Shandong University Faculty's Final Appeal - Demands Salary Adjustment from the Central Government - Decides to Suspend Classes and Await Orders from May 5th

[Our Newspaper Qingdao 27th Dispatch] All the faculty of Shandong University had previously sent two telegrams to the central government appealing for the same treatment as the faculty of universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other cities. When the standard of living allowance was last adjusted, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin were all listed as first-class, while Qingdao was listed as second-class. It is heard that this time, the salaries of faculty members of national universities in Xi'an, Hangzhou, and other places have been increased, but Shandong University is still holding on to the corner. The faculty of the school deeply feel that the treatment is unfair and have decided to send another telegram to the Ministry of Education as a final appeal. If there is no satisfactory result, they have decided to go on strike collectively from May 5th. The original telegram sent by the school to the Ministry of Education is as follows: "Urgent, Zhu Junjian, Minister of Education, Nanjing: In the past, due to the continuous rise in prices and the difficulty of living in Qingdao, we have twice appealed to the National Government Executive Yuan and your department by telegraph to treat Shandong University the same as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other universities when adjusting the standard of living allowance. Last time, Shandong University was already holding on to the corner, causing those in office to feel heartbroken and those who have not yet come to hesitate. We originally planned to seek other jobs to maintain our lives, but at that time, due to the situation in eastern Shandong, the people of Qingdao were nervous, and we did not dare to affect the stability of education work due to the difficulties of our personal lives. Now that the people are at peace, prices are rising even higher, exceeding those in Beijing and Tianjin. Education personnel are not valued, but they should not be allowed to be impoverished without being accounted for. If this adjustment is not the same as those in Beijing and other schools, we can only ask for the whole body to seek a way to survive. It has been decided to suspend classes and await orders from May 5th and pack our luggage in preparation for the first stop. Has the request in the previous telegram been approved by the Central Committee? Please telegraph us to decide our actions. National Shandong University, all faculty members kowtow to you."

### Jiangning District Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Promoting Public Education

Directors Gu and Li Attended and Delivered Speeches

Jiangning District Held a Joint Meeting of All District Principals and Bao Chiefs to Promote Public Education.

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, principals of public and private schools and bao chiefs of Jiangning District of this city held a joint meeting at the auditorium of the Municipal Experimental Public School on Jiaozhou Road. Over ninety people attended, including District Chief Wu Zhongda of the district, Liu Yanqing representing Datong University, principals Wei Qiongying and Wu Hanyuan of various public and private primary and secondary schools, Jiang Xiulin, director of the Municipal Public School, and bao chiefs such as He Guosheng. Director Gu, Deputy Director Li, Section Chief Wang, Section Chief Sun, and Supervisor Yong of the Municipal Bureau of Education were all present to provide guidance. The meeting began with reports from Yu Qingtan, director of the promotion district, and Wei Qiongying, deputy director, who chaired the meeting. Following this, Director Gu delivered a speech, stating: Since the Municipal Council established the Literacy Movement Committee, the education community has also established the Public Education Promotion Committee. Although the names are different, the meaning is the same. Public elementary schools in this district were previously called primary schools, but now they are changed to national schools. The significance lies in that, in addition to educating children, adults must also be educated. Public schools must also educate children. For example, the Experimental Public School not only runs adult classes, but also runs nurseries and children's classes. Therefore, popularizing public education must include both children and adults and cannot be biased. Today, the local autonomous bodies and educational institutions in this district are working together to discuss the promotion of public education. The results will be promising in the future. However, it is necessary to carry out the work effectively, starting with a survey and then proceeding in stages based on statistics. Textbooks should be simple and easy to understand, the teaching time should be appropriate, and university students and intellectuals should be mobilized to participate in this work. As for factories running worker education, it is not only a welfare program for workers, but also beneficial to the factory's production efficiency. It is hoped that all bao chiefs will do their best to promote it together. Deputy Director Li then addressed the district, encouraging the district to work hard and providing instructions on the importance of education reaching the people and on teaching techniques. Section Chief Sun and Supervisor Shui also gave speeches successively. Then proposals were discussed and the following resolutions were made: (1) The district office, the Experimental Public School, the Public School, the Central National School, the National School, the YWCA, Datong University, and private primary and secondary schools will be responsible for conducting a household survey of the 51st Bao in the district and complete it within five days. (2) Please ask the factories to prepare worker schools and worker children's schools. The draft five-year plan for promoting public education in the district was also discussed. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM.

### On the Eve of Xingdao's Departure from Hong Kong: A Wonderful Performance, A Slap, Defeated Vietnam, Buddha Zhaorong Scores Five Goals Alone

The Vietnam team, who were competing in Hong Kong, gave an outstanding performance in the first two matches, and the fans welcomed the challenge from Xingdao with "folded hands".

On the 22nd, it was drizzling, but the fans' enthusiasm by the Causeway Bay was not diminished, and the stadium was still full.

As a result of the battle, the Tiger team won by five goals to nil. Under absolute superiority, Vietnam was defeated. At the beginning of the battle, the Vietnam team had the wind advantage and was used to playing on wet ground. However, due to inferior tactics and skills, Xingdao took three goals first, even in the headwinds in the first half. Therefore, there was no need to discuss the situation in the second half.

Vietnam slightly adjusted its formation, and Paisley was transferred to the forward position (returning to the center back in the second half), hoping to strengthen the front line attack, but to no avail. Moreover, the Vietnam team only had the opportunity to shoot "two feet" in the second half. The "magic leg" allocated it to Zhaorong to score the first goal, and of course, it was even worse!

Xingdao, unexpectedly Cheng recovered from his injury and returned to the game. Others followed the usual formation. All five goals were scored by "Buddha" Zhaorong. Each goal was shot in the penalty area, which was very crisp. The Vietnamese goalkeeper could only sigh at the ball.

How were the five goals scored? At the time of contact, the two sides were in a stalemate and mixed fight. After 15 minutes, Jingxiang saw that it was not the right way, and immediately switched positions with Jinhai. The "magic leg" personally supervised the battle and lured the enemy guards out. Then Xingdao had a chance. It is estimated that of the three goals scored, two were passed by the right side to Zhaorong to shoot in. In the last goal, Qiuting passed the ball to Zhaorong, and took the opportunity to shoot in one fell swoop. On the other hand, the Vietnamese side had no chance to make a formal shot.

In the second half, Xingdao's offensive slowed down slightly, and Jingxiang again picked the ball to Zhaorong to score the fourth goal. In the last minute, Xingdao got a penalty of five shots in the penalty area. The rosters of both sides on that day.

Xingdao

Yu Yaode, Liu Tianshen, Hou Rongsheng, Feng Kunsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Songsheng, Cao Qiuting, Li Zhaorong, Feng Jingxiang, Zhang Jinhai, He Yingfen

### Hong Kong-Vietnam Port Game: Hong Kong Team Loses First and Wins Later

The Vietnam team lost to Junlian by three to two, winning the first battle. On the 20th, the port game was officially held. A large number of fans were attracted to the Navy stadium by Causeway Bay, and all the seats were full.

Before the war, because Junlian's lineup was strong, it was expected that the Vietnam team would lose. But the battle turned out to be unexpected. The Hong Kong team lost two to zero in the first half. In the second half, the Vietnam team lost two unjust goals, and the Hong Kong team was able to turn defeat into victory. To be honest, the victory was not clear.

According to the facts, if we talk about technology, the Hong Kong team is actually better. However, the performance was slightly substandard. The two foreign forwards were not used to using the left to attack, so although there were many offenses, they were blind. The only reason they got the final victory was a combination of skill and luck.

On the other hand, the Vietnamese team played well in both offense and defense. It was indeed great to be able to take two goals first. The Vietnamese team used the first battle lineup. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

Hong Kong United Team

Bao Weilu (42nd Battalion), Hou Rongsheng (Xingdao), Xie Jinhong (South China), Feng Kunsheng (Xingdao), Chen Li (Joseph), Liu Songsheng (Xingdao), Cao Qiuting (Xingdao), Zou Wenzhi (South China), She Jinhe (South China)

At 5:00 PM, after the military music played the English and French songs, referee Rogers ordered the start of the war. Within 15 minutes, the Hong Kong United Team besieged the gate, and the Vietnamese team's hinterland was in danger frequently, but they either shot high or diagonally, unable to open the record.

At 18 minutes, Zhang Hu was deceived by Chen Li, and Rong Sheng rushed forward to intercept him. Hu Shou immediately raised his foot. Bao Zalu was caught off guard. Although the ball was caught, it still crashed into the barrier. Hong Kong was behind by one goal first.

The United team counterattacked, and Jinhe's quick shot was patted out. Kunsheng passed it far away, and Xiao Weilu's header went over the post again. After a long attack, the Vietnam team got the opportunity to advance.

But seeing Hu Shou and Wen Bao advance side by side, the four-footed ball had already reached the Hong Kong restricted area. Hu Shou picked up the ball and shot, and Bao Weilu could not save it, and the Hong Kong team lost another one, finishing the first half at two to zero.

After the break, the Hong Kong United Team vowed to counterattack. In four minutes, Sha Liyun swept across the bottom line, and the ball had crossed the goal line. Luo Liaowen Yang, eager to save the ball, kicked the ball into the net, turning into a reverse. The Vietnam team was forced to become two to one.

After getting this opportunity, the Hong Kong team immediately occupied the offense, but there was no chance to break the goal.

At 32 minutes, Qiuting was seen sneaking in along the side, and a kick in the middle, Sha Liyun flew forward and slammed forward, the ball crossed into the net, and snatched a tie.

Seeing that the time was running out, both sides were trying to maintain a draw. Finally, the Hong Kong United Team attacked urgently, and the ball was in front of the Vietnamese team's goal. Bai Sini and goalkeeper Nguyen Quang misunderstood, and Xiao Weilu flashed in to push the ball, and the situation was decided. Three to two, the Vietnamese team lost unconvinced!

### Higher Education Institution Growing During Wartime: National Teachers College

— Yan Keshu

The National Teachers College has been established for nine years. Educationalists are likely to be interested in its performance. Based on what I know, I will briefly describe it as follows:

(A) The Difficulty of Establishment and the Rapid Development

In July of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], the Ministry of Education appointed Liao Shicheng, Wu Junsheng, Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Jingnong, Wang Deyao as members of the preparatory committee for the National Teachers College, with Liao Shicheng as the director. After receiving the order, Mr. Liao went to Hunan to select a site for the college. After several surveys, he finally chose Lantian Town in Anhua. By the end of October of that year, the preparations were completed, and the Ministry appointed Mr. Liao as the president. At that time, a great fire broke out in Changsha, and rumors spread, shaking the entire Hunan. Mr. Liao remained calm and officially started classes on December 1st. In the following three or four years, there were several battles in Changsha and Changde. Lantian was close to the war zone, constantly threatened and shaken, and faced difficulties daily. Recruiting people was even more difficult. However, the college experienced surprisingly rapid development during that time. Here are some of the most prominent achievements: (1) Expansion of College Buildings: Initially, the college rented a residential building, Li Garden, and built a few classrooms and a small playground. Later, new buildings were added each year, totaling more than 40 buildings and over 400 mu of land. (2) Expansion of Educational Institutions: When it was first established, the college had seven departments: Chinese, English, History and Geography, Civic Education, Physics and Chemistry, Mathematics, and Education. Subsequently, various specialized courses in physical education and children's education, preparatory classes, folk education centers (with six affiliated folk schools), affiliated middle schools, primary schools for children of faculty and staff (with affiliated kindergartens), junior departments, specialized courses in music, training courses for physical education teachers, in-service training classes for central and national school teachers, physical education departments, natural history departments, and educational material centers (exchanging educational materials with Columbia University in the United States) were added each year. (3) Increase in Staff and Students: In the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], there were fewer than 20 faculty and staff members and only over 90 students. By the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], the college headquarters, affiliated primary and secondary schools, and folk schools had a total of over 250 faculty and staff members and 2,600 students. In five years, the number of faculty and staff increased more than tenfold, and the number of students increased more than twentyfold.

(B) Resilient Evacuation and Steadfast Support

By the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], the National Teachers College had developed into a large institution with seven departments, four specialized courses, three classes, and affiliated middle schools, children's primary schools, and folk education centers. Its scale was comparable to some of the older universities in the country. At that time, many professors in each department were well-known figures. In terms of teachers' colleges, it was unparalleled in the country. Therefore, there were discussions about adding graduate programs and recruiting university graduates to start a second department, with the aim of becoming a more complete teacher education institution. People in the education sector also had high expectations. Unexpectedly, in the summer of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], enemy troops moved south and Changsha fell. The college then organized a wartime service team to assist national troops, American pilots, and Chinese and foreign refugees. The Shaoyang Central Daily News stated that "The National Teachers College has become a stabilizing force in the area." An editorial in the Lantian Lixing Daily also stated that "Since the war, the National Teachers College is the only national university near the front lines that has stood firm and unwavering. Its determination and resilience must be seen as the embodiment of the nation's righteous spirit." As Puyang and Hengyang fell one after another, Lantian was surrounded. The Ministry of Education issued instructions, and the college had to move first to Xinhua and then to Xupu. Despite the inadequate conditions, classes resumed on November 20th of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944]. Before the faculty and students could settle down in Xupu for a year, the Battle of West Hunan broke out. Books and instruments were dispersed to Junping and Simeng, two nearby villages, but classes were never suspended.

(C) Relocation After the Victory of the War of Resistance

After the victory of the War of Resistance, when education was being restored, the National Teachers College, citing reasons such as the gathering of famous teachers, a simple and pure academic atmosphere, remarkable achievements, and international cultural exchange, requested to be renamed National Central Teachers College and to be located in the capital area or a larger city, so as to expand and enrich the college and continue its legacy. The Ministry of Education firmly rejected this request. President Liao finally obeyed the Ministry's order and moved to Mount Heng. Only an old Bible college was available, with a size less than one-fifth of that of Lantian. The total amount of restoration funds was only over 300 million yuan, so the future development of the college has become very difficult.

(D) Reminiscing About the Past, Looking Forward to the Future

(I) A glimpse of the academic achievements of the college headquarters students: (1) Consistently achieved excellent results in the national academic competitions organized by the Ministry of Education. (2) In the 15th Hunan Provincial Games and the Nanyue Youth Summer Camp (attended by 27 schools from five provinces), the college ranked first in both events. (3) Responded to the youth's joining the army movement, exceeding the quota by a large margin.

(II) A glimpse of the service achievements of graduates and interns: (1) There are currently over 600 graduates and interns from the college serving in schools at all levels, accounting for 95% of the total. (2) The service locations cover provinces and cities such as Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shaanxi, Gansu, Taiwan, Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Chongqing. They do not focus on fame and fortune and have been highly praised by society.

(III) Simple and Sincere Academic Atmosphere: (1) Diligent in studies, abiding by rules, and not distracted by external events. (2) Austere in life, enduring hardships even after repeated relocations. (3) Respecting teachers and valuing morality, sincerely and earnestly doing their best to care for teachers in times of difficulty.

(IV) A glimpse of the academic achievements of the affiliated middle school students: (1) The first graduating class ranked first in the Hunan Provincial Middle School Entrance Examination, tied with Xinyi Middle School. More than 80% of high school graduates were admitted to renowned national universities. (2) The military training performance and graduation examination results were commended by the Ministry of Education.

In summary, the college will surely continue to develop and become a model for higher normal education in our country. However, since moving to Mount Heng according to the order, the college has encountered the following serious difficulties: (1) Inadequate college buildings and insufficient restoration funds. (2) The social economy is becoming increasingly strained, and Nanyue is a small area with a high population density. The current cost of living is higher than in any other region of Hunan, making it extremely difficult to recruit faculty. However, based on my observations, the college has at least three strengths that can be unleashed: (1) The spirit of President Liao and the professors in upholding justice and righteousness; (2) The simple and sincere academic tradition; (3) The alumni's and students' interest and enthusiasm for the cause of education. If our education authorities can improve the college's situation and provide generous support, then with the college's deep-rooted spirit of the past, it will surely overcome all difficulties. I also hope that the college can continue to "cut through thorns and briars, and treat dangers as if they were flat ground," "wear out one's hair and wear down one's heels, thinking of this always" (words from President Liao's college anthem) to build its glorious and brilliant future!

### Textile and Cotton Cloth Industries Offer Opinions on Controlling the Re-export of Yarn and Cloth

Should Strive to be Realistic and Reduce Troubles

The textile and cotton cloth industries are deeply worried about the newly promulgated control measures of the Executive Yuan. In the past three or four days, due to the customs' delayed cessation of customs declarations, those who have declared are rushing to replenish the spot goods, so the market is still full of vitality. However, according to people in the industry, this is just like a flash in the pan, which will soon be extinguished. Moreover, if the control measures are really taken as an example of transportation to the south, the procedures are cumbersome and the quantities do not match the facts, and the business will inevitably be greatly hit. The directors and supervisors of the two industry associations have held several meetings and are deeply anxious. The day before yesterday afternoon, Mr. Pan Shihao inquired about the policy of the control measures from Mr. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee, and provided the opinions of the industry. According to Mr. Liu, the Textile Control Committee did not know about this matter beforehand. Mayor Wu, in his capacity as Chairman, instructed the Business Department to properly draft a plan after receiving the order, which is still being drafted. The main points are roughly: (1) The re-export of yarn and cloth will be generally controlled. However, local yarn and local cloth are not subject to this restriction. (2) The quota for re-export to various places will be based on pre-war statistics. (3) The registration procedures for transport merchants will be formulated separately. Mr. Pan immediately represented the textile and cotton cloth industries and put forward his opinions: (1) The types of control should be reduced. For example, line ni and patterned fabrics are definitely not objects for speculation and hoarding. Moreover, these manufacturers are in trouble and need to promote their slow-moving inventory. Please exempt them from control. (2) The control base should be increased to ensure that households and small vendors are not restricted. (3) Manufacturers who have factories in this city and other places and need to circulate raw materials and finished products internally to complete the production sequence should not be subject to control. (4) Those who have already traded before the order issued by the Executive Yuan should be allowed to re-export as soon as possible. (5) The quantity of re-exports to various places can be used as a reference for pre-war statistics, but it is difficult to conform to the facts if it is used as a standard. The Textile Control Committee seems to be able to set a total quantity that can be re-exported from this city every month or every week, which will be distributed publicly by the industry association. (6) Members of the industry association should have the qualifications to undertake re-exports without the need to re-register. The future review of this matter and the application of procedures should be given the opportunity to participate in the industry-wide conference. Liu has not yet made any specific statements on this matter. It is heard that the textile and cotton cloth industry associations will submit another plan to the Textile Control Committee and the Municipal Government.

### Tianjin City Strictly Investigates Illegal Silver Shops, Thirteen Cases Cracked in One Week

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The Tianjin Municipal Authorities announced that 13 illegal silver shops have been investigated in the past week. These shops privately deposit and lend funds, use floating capital, and engage in speculation, which has greatly affected prices. The Municipal Government will continue to ban them. In addition, the thorough investigation of the black market for gold here has been heard of recently. On the 26th, Sanyang Gold Shop was raided for illegally buying and selling gold. According to the authorities, the shop has been conducting black market transactions every day since the implementation of economic emergency measures, and the amounts are very large.

### Cigarette Association Notifies Members Not to Raise Prices Arbitrarily

The Commercial Association of Cigarettes, Soap, Lighters, and Matches in this city notified its members yesterday: "It has been found that most of the cigarettes, soap, lighters, and matches operated by our association are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. All exchange persons must not arbitrarily raise market prices or buy and sell on behalf of customers in the market, which will increase the burden on the public. This association has repeatedly issued notices to strictly prohibit this. Now that prices of all goods have risen sharply again, the government authorities are implementing economic emergency measures to strictly suppress them. It is hoped that all exchange persons will pay attention to this to avoid criticism from public opinion and sanctions from laws and regulations. This notice is hereby issued for compliance."

### Fuel Management Committee Permits Coal Merchants to Purchase Anthracite Coal Themselves

The coal industry in this city previously requested the Fuel Management Committee to allow them to purchase coal themselves to open up sources. It is now known that the Fuel Management Committee has approved merchants to purchase and transport coal themselves to combat speculation in coal, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for implementation from now on. The measures for allowing manufacturers to purchase and transport anthracite coal themselves are excerpted as follows: (1) If factories in the supply area of this committee need to purchase anthracite coal, in addition to the Kailuan, Zhongyu, Huainan, East China mines, and the coal mines in Taiwan and the northeastern provinces, they may apply to this committee or the Nanjing office of this committee for anthracite coal produced in other regions, and transport it themselves. However, the area allowed for self-purchase and transportation should not conflict with local fuel control measures. (2) If the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that management is necessary in the area where self-purchase and transportation is allowed, it will issue a public announcement to stop the purchase and transportation (3) After a factory or coal merchant's application for self-purchase and transportation of coal is approved, the committee will issue a certificate of permission to purchase and transport anthracite coal themselves, and take it to the designated area for purchase and transportation. If it needs to be delayed to other places after it arrives in Nanjing or Shanghai, it should be reported to the committee for verification and a coal transportation certificate will be issued to allow passage. (4) Factories applying for a certificate must submit the registration certificate issued by the competent authority and the latest coal-using equipment list, product quantity list, and a certificate from the industry association to verify. (5) The quantity of coal purchased and transported by the factory each time shall not exceed the actual monthly demand of the factory, but those with a monthly demand of less than 50 tons may purchase enough for two months at a time. (6) The coal approved by the committee for self-purchase and transportation may be purchased and transported jointly by the factories. If the factories cannot purchase and transport themselves, they may state the reasons and entrust a coal merchant to transport it on their behalf, but a power of attorney must be submitted for verification when applying. (7) Coal merchants applying for self-purchase and transportation of anthracite coal are temporarily limited to 100 tons per month for each business, and each business should obtain a certificate from the association to which it belongs and submit it to the committee for issuing a certificate of permission to purchase and transport anthracite coal themselves. (8) After the coal arrives, it should be reported to the committee for verification with the coal certificate or mineral tax bill issued by the mining site in the place of origin. If the quantity exceeds the approved quantity, the excess part will be purchased by the committee according to the purchase price. (9) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval and promulgation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

### General Situation of Tung Oil in Southern Anhui

— Cao Sibin

The position of tung oil in southern Anhui is not as important as that of tea leaves, but because there are many mountains in southern Anhui, and the soil and climate are also suitable for planting tung trees, if the government can actively promote it, then promotion will definitely be easy, and the benefits will also be significant.

The tung oil producing areas in southern Anhui are mainly Ningguo and Guichi. The next are Zhizhi, Xiuning, Shexian, Qimen, Shitai, Jingxian, Jingde, Jixi, Xuancheng and other places; at the same time, there is a lot of wasteland in Langxi and Guangde areas, which can be reclaimed and replanted with tung trees.

In the past, tung oil in southern Anhui did not have an independent position. The products produced in Guichi area were transported to Nanjing by Gujia for domestic sales. The products produced in Xiuning and Shexian areas are of higher quality, so they are often resold to Shanghai by Hangzhou oil merchants for foreign sales. However, because of its small output, people often only know that it is tung oil produced in Zhejiang, and ignore that it is produced in southern Anhui. As for the quality of tung oil in southern Anhui, according to the purchasing results of the Trade Commission during the war, it is higher than that of neighboring provinces. The oil content is usually between 15170 and 15180 degrees. Moreover, the acid value is very low, which is indeed very suitable for foreign sales standards. The annual output is about 50,000 piculs. But the actual number, according to those familiar with the inside information, should be between 60,000 and 70,000 piculs. From this point of view, tung oil in southern Anhui really has a lot of room for development. The problem is only how to encourage the trend of planting tung trees, and the government's promotion and guidance.

Output Table of Tung Oil in Southern Anhui

Xuancheng 237 piculs

Ningguo 10,046 piculs

Xiuning 7,725 piculs

Shexian 5,365 piculs

Qimen 5,075 piculs

Yixian 2,340 piculs

Guichi 10,334 piculs

Zhizhi 3,426 piculs

Taiping 118 piculs

### Denver: Exploring the Heart of the Rocky Mountain Empire and Traces of the Founding Father

— Mao Shuqing, Special Correspondent in the United States of this Newspaper

Denver, Colorado, 7th Dispatch

Returning to New York from Los Angeles, crossing the entire United States, Americans describe the longest journey, often using a colloquialism: "From Los Angeles to New York, railway companies are most happy to sell 'full-fare' tickets from Los Angeles to New York, and several companies are quite competitive in offering preferential treatment." A friend only spent forty-five dollars to buy a railway ticket called "Pacific Special Train," which is unprecedentedly cheap.

I still followed the road to Nevada and Utah. On the way back, I stayed in Nevada for five days. "The scenery of Utah is the best in the world." I only appreciated it for a while through the car window. I stayed in "Xiangyuan," the capital of Wyoming, for half a day, and then detoured from Xiangyuan to Colorado.

Wyoming is a desolate state, with a vast area and sparse population, a semi-desert grassland area, without farmers to develop. The population of the United States is not yet proportional to the land. The east is dense and the west is sparse. The "westward movement" of the United States has been going on for nearly a hundred years, and it is still continuing. The Population Census Bureau in Washington most recently released figures: on average, one in thirteen families in the United States is moving westward. Today, there are 1.08 million families in the United States who are on the road from east to west, most of whom are small families of veterans, and more than half of their goals are to move to California, where they can see the sun all year round!

Therefore, states like Wyoming will always be in a calm situation. Their society is quiet and peaceful, and prices are much lower than in the east and much lower than on the west coast. I walked slowly on the streets of Xiangyuan, breathing the clear and free air, and felt a supreme ease. Xiangyuan has a newspaper, the Wyoming Tribune, which publishes two large sheets a day, and claims to have 100,000 readers.

I attended the Wyoming State Senate as an observer. That day, the senators were enthusiastically discussing the "salary increase" issue for state civil servants. The proposal from the state government was to increase the average annual salary from $3,600 to $4,200. Most of the senators were in favor of it, and a bald state senator advocated reviewing the state government's budget.

A pastor Branford who returned from the Soviet Union, the "hero" of Wyoming, was cheered by many listeners. He gave a speech in the "Baptist Church," proving that "Soviet Russia is a beastly country without God or religion." He also reported many things he saw and heard in the Soviet Union. Nowadays, people who can enter Soviet Russia and return safely have become heroes worshiped by the American people!

Glorious Double Ten is Related to Denver

In this way, I arrived in Colorado in a hurry. The car drove straight south from Xiangyuan, which is a broad avenue leading to Colorado. After three hours of smooth travel, I walked on the eastern foot of the Rocky Mountains. The morning sun shone on the majestic Rocky Mountains.

I should carefully introduce Denver, which is translated as Danver on Chinese maps, the capital of Colorado, the capital of the "Rocky Mountain Empire," and also the place where the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen conceived his revolutionary theory. The name Denver should be translated as Denver. Americans quite dislike words like "Devil" and call him "Danver."

When celebrating the Double Ten National Day the year before last, the Mayor of Denver gave a speech, the gist of which was: The brilliant revolution of the Chinese Double Ten Festival is closely related to Denver, because Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary theory and revolutionary ideas were formed in Denver. There was an even more bizarre passage in the mayor's speech. He said: During the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was working as a "waiter" in a restaurant in Denver (Note: In American society where occupational concepts are equal, this sentence does not have any insulting meaning). One day, Dr. Sun received a telegram in the restaurant, knowing that the revolution had not only broken out, but also responded in various provinces, and it was really successful. He quickly took off his uniform, threw down the plate, ran to the road, waved his hands indiscriminately, and shouted: The Chinese Revolution is successful! "At that time, we people in Denver didn't know much about China. Many people saw Dr. Sun and were confused"!

Studying Revolutionary Theories in the Library

This is just a paragraph in the speech. The entire speech was very sympathetic and friendly to China. I spent a week in Denver, very carefully inquiring about the anecdotes of the Founding Father's revolution back then, and also specially visited Mayor Stapleton. The Mayor arranged a luncheon for me the next day. During the meeting, he said that although he was in his old age and had been Mayor for fifteen years, he was not familiar with Mr. Zhongshan back then, because according to what he knew, Mr. Zhongshan spent most of his time in Denver studying revolutionary theories in the library. Mr. Zhongshan's speeches were mostly given to Chinese overseas Chinese, and he did not have the opportunity to listen to them. I asked him about the content of his speech on the Double Ten Festival the year before last. He said he had forgotten, because the speech was written by his secretary, and he just read it once!

Windsor Hotel, Where the Founding Father Lived Back Then

Mayor Stapleton is very familiar with several old overseas Chinese: Hu Hehui, Hu Hezhen, the owners of "Guangdong Restaurant" and "Chongqing Building". Later, I also talked in detail with a young overseas Chinese leader, Mr. Huang Guoguang. Mr. Huang said that it is a fact that the Founding Father often lived in Denver, but it is absolutely impossible for him to be a waiter, because at that time, the Tongmenghui had already been established, and the Founding Father led the overall revolutionary plan, and he did not need to rely on being a waiter to maintain his life economically, and he did not have the time to engage in "side jobs". Huang Guoguang said that as far as he knew, Mr. Zhongshan often lived in a hotel called Windsor Hotel on Larimer Street at that time. At that time, Denver was still a small city, and the southern half of the city had not been developed at all. Larimer Street was in Tokyo City, which was relatively prosperous.

Huang Guoguang now runs a "New China" restaurant. He is diligent in his work and humble in his dealings with people. Therefore, although he opened his restaurant in the "political district" in the south of the city, his business is very prosperous.

Visiting the Sino-American Club on 15th Street

Later, I visited the "Sino-American Club" in Denver, No. 915, 15th Street, which was a product of the war. During the war, a large number of Chinese air force personnel came to Denver for training. In order to comfort these young men's loneliness in a foreign land, this club was established. An American old lady in her fifties, Fanding, is the manager of the club. She introduced me to many Chinese friends. She said that she has maintained friendly relations with the Chinese for 40 years, because the Chinese are honest and pay attention to morality. She has never been to China and cannot speak Chinese.

She said that Mr. Zhongshan lived in Denver for a long time, and often gave speeches about the revolution in a building at No. 2015 Market St. Once, she also listened with the overseas Chinese, but Mr. Zhongshan did not know her. She said that the building is still there now, and is managed by an old lady named Allen.

I wandered in front of No. 205 for a long time. The house was tightly locked. It seems that it is now the "Overseas Chinese Guild Hall". Old Mrs. Allen was not there, so I made a trip in vain.

Three Different Types of Overseas Chinese

The Chinese in Denver are slowly forgetting the stories of the previous generation, and the younger generation is standing up vigorously. The Chinese in Denver can probably be summarized into three different types: overseas Chinese from Guangdong, engineers, and aviators. On the second floor of the Customs Building, I met Mr. Xu Huaiyun, the representative of the Resources Committee stationed in Denver. He is the chief person in charge of the design of the Yangtze River Power Plant in Denver. Xu said that the design work is being carried out in cooperation with the U.S. Reclamation Bureau. The design is entrusted by the Resources Committee to the Reclamation Bureau. Half of the designers are Chinese and American engineers.

I met several young engineers who worked at the Reclamation Bureau. They are energetic, have ideals, and have ambitions. The Reclamation Bureau is in charge of water conservancy and irrigation projects in seventeen states in the western United States. This is one of the most needed and truly practical agencies for the people of China today.

Chinese Trainee Air Force to Return to China in August After Completing Training

In the Sino-American Club, I met "Peter Wu," Mr. Wu Chongzhen, the translator and English teacher of the Chinese Air Force training team in the United States. He came to the United States during the war and moved around with the Air Force soldiers, because of the different types of training and the different locations. A training team often moves here today and there tomorrow. He said that there are still about XX people training near Denver now. They have learned reconnaissance, bombing, radar, aviation manufacturing, etc. Because of their good results, they are appreciated by General LOWE, the director of the training camp. According to Wu Chongzhen, the entire training period will be completed in August this year, and everyone will return to China. It is difficult to say whether anyone will be sent here in the future.

During the Chinese Lunar New Year, there was a grand celebration in the Denver Air Force camp, and there were also very lively scenes in the city of Denver. Unfortunately, there are too few overseas Chinese, "less and less every year," old lady Fanding said with great emotion.

I should quote a bit of historical story to explain the relationship between Colorado and the Chinese overseas Chinese. Colorado is the most important state in the Rocky Mountains. Before the American Civil War, it was still the world of the Red Indians. Although there were white people, they were only a minority. In the year the Civil War broke out, the far-sighted Lincoln appointed General Gilpin, the first wartime governor, to Denver in order to win the cooperation of the West. This situation is similar to that before the establishment of the Xikang Provincial Government before 1939. Although the provincial institution has not been established, it already has the prototype of a "province". General Gilpin arrived in Denver at the end of February 1861, and Colorado was officially "established as a province" on August 1, 1876. To this day, there is a bronze statue of General Gilpin in front of the State Senate of Colorado.

It is said that the first white man to enter Colorado was named "Russell". He came to mine gold and trekked from Kansas to Colorado, and had a bloody battle with the Red Indians. That was in 1858.

Large Influx of Overseas Chinese Before the Establishment of the Province

The arrival of overseas Chinese in Colorado was before the "establishment of the province", around 1865. The earliest "founding father" was named Chen Lingshu (transliteration). At that time, because the Civil War had ended, the United States was building a large number of railways, and Chen Lingshu was responsible for recruiting Chinese railway workers. In 1870, there were as many as 3,000 Chinese railway workers in Denver. After the railway was built, many stayed in Denver. Slowly, slowly, people "returned to China" every year. There were more people returning and fewer people coming. Now there are only 150 people left. Old lady Fanding said very emotionally that these overseas Chinese do not believe in Christianity very much, but they all have a kind heart!

Starting with Industry, Chinese Students Study Mining

The University of Denver is famous for its mining and metallurgical engineering. Many Chinese students study mining and metallurgy. Many people have graduated and are preparing to return immediately. Several are preparing to go to Northeast China to open mines. They are concerned about the safety of Northeast China. There are also about dozens of engineers from the Resources Committee who are designing the Yangtze River dam. Their design work will take another year or two. Xu Huaiyun said that the initial contract signed by the Resources Committee with the US Reclamation Bureau stipulated that China should pay a design fee of 500,000 US dollars, and 200,000 US dollars has been paid so far.

Colorado is a province that started with industry, especially metallurgy, water conservancy, and the electricity industry and reclamation related to water conservancy. I have a diligent and energetic impression of Denver, and it gives people a sense of vitality everywhere.

I visited the State Senate, the Mint, and two newspapers. The Mint is located in a sophisticated building in the south of the city. Because Colorado produces gold and silver, the currency minted every year reaches more than 30 million yuan.

Two Newspapers: The Authority of Public Opinion in the Province

Denver has two newspapers: The Denver Post, the authority of public opinion in the province, publishes five editions a day, and sells about 200,000 copies a day. It is a very profitable newspaper. The founder was Pompeo, an Italian-American. Now that Pompeo is dead, some of the stock has been sold. Pompeo's daughter, Helen, is now the financial director of the newspaper. The current chairman is Campbell, and the editor-in-chief is McCain.

The Rocky Mountain Empire News is a Howard-affiliated newspaper, tabloid size, sells about 100,000 copies, and is hosted by Foster. The news editor is Cassel. They have telecommunications connections with the Howard Editorial Department in Washington, and editorials, etc. are all sent from Washington.

Understanding China is the Primary Task

Both newspapers had reporters interview me, and they both published my photos and news. They are interested in China, but they know too little about China. They regard Secretary of State Marshall as a "sage". They believe that throughout history, Marshall is the only one who understands China.

The day after I arrived in Denver, a senator from Nevada returned to Nevada from Washington, and gave a speech there, opposing lending to any foreign country, and the loan negotiations with China should be stopped. Many American friends asked for my opinion, and I had the pain of "not knowing where to start with the Twenty-Four Histories". I feel that how to make the people in the interior of the United States understand China and know China is the most important task currently standing between China and the United States!

### The Suppurating Sore of Northern Jiangsu

— Jiyi

Northern Jiangsu 20th Quick Dispatch

This vast plain of Northern Jiangsu is neither a desert like Mengjiang nor a barren land like Northern Shaanxi. Its location is at the administrative and commercial heart of the nation, adjacent to Nanjing and Shanghai. Its safety directly impacts the security of Nanjing and Shanghai and indirectly affects the overall national situation! The Chinese Communists (CCP) regard it as their sole "granary" and a strategic point they must contend for in both military and political terms. Since the government began its "pacification" efforts there, the CCP initially took great precautions, fearing a strong offensive that would be difficult to resist. Therefore, in the early stages of pacification, they did reduce many targets by adopting tactics such as "streamlining troops and administration" and "breaking up into smaller units." They also temporarily abandoned some key points and lines. However, not long after, they realized, "These so-called brilliant plans are nothing but this," and gradually revived from many corners.

The Onset of Suppuration is Quite Severe, Threatening to Sweep Across the Entire Area

The officials responsible for pacification and security, after months of effort, managed to clear several major transportation lines. The people living along these lines and in the urban strongholds, as well as those who had fled from the countryside to the cities, had been enduring daily torment and sleeping in the fields every night. Now, suddenly, they were back in the embrace of the government. Their feelings of joy and excitement were, of course, indescribable. However, the officials, walking under heavily guarded conditions along the transportation lines, had few opportunities to visit the people in depth. They looked at the surface, seeing theaters, bars, radios, and neon lights weaving together a scene of great prosperity, and declared that the bandits of Northern Jiangsu had been eradicated and the great task of pacification had been completed. The government, based on these official reports and the "inspection records" produced by a few inspection personnel who only attended banquets in the cities and rode in cars on the highways, believed that Northern Jiangsu was indeed peaceful. As a result, many National Revolutionary Army troops were transferred elsewhere. With this, the CCP, relying on their detailed intelligence, was given another opportunity to regroup. Furthermore, it was the time when wheat and tall grass grew luxuriantly in the countryside, the best time for them to launch activities and counterattacks. Therefore, in the past month or so, the wound that seemed to have closed on the surface has been festering inside again. This suppuration is coming on strong, threatening to sweep across the entire body! But the "doctor" seems to have overlooked it!

City Intellectuals are Debating, But Rural Towns and Strongholds Cannot Be Lost

At present, Northern Jiangsu, from south of the old course of the Huai and Yellow Rivers to the north bank of the Yangtze River, a vital "granary" that the CCP calls the "Central Jiangsu Military Region," is almost a vacuum in terms of our military and political installations. The commanding officer of the First Pacification Zone did indeed make great efforts in this area in the past. However, military and political efforts still lacked practical coordination, and political efforts were not closely linked to the people. Those responsible for military affairs said, "Politics is more important than military affairs. Now that we have driven away the Communist bandits, you should do your job well." Those responsible for administrative affairs said, "Although the Communist bandits have temporarily retreated, their military strength has not been eliminated. As soon as the National Revolutionary Army leaves, they will return! The self-defense forces are only good for catching petty thieves. We have nothing to work with, how can we push forward!" Each had their own reasons, and none were wrong. The mistake still lies in the lack of practical coordination between military and political efforts, the failure to thoroughly implement military and political orders, and the pervasive corruption and deception from top to bottom, which are the biggest obstacles! Recently, within the territory of Nantong, where the Pacification Headquarters is located, three towns, including Yigang and Qiaotou Bridge, were lost in succession. These important strongholds were lost amidst the situation where military and political officials in the city were debating and mutually suspicious. The self-defense forces in these two places numbered over 400, all outstanding young men who had suffered greatly from the Communist army and voluntarily joined the service. Their weapons and ammunition were also purchased with their own savings and loans. They were determined not to be deceived by the Communist army again. Therefore, when attacked, they fought day and night, resolutely resisting with the unity of the military and the people. However, the result was the same: because they received no assistance, they were all killed by the Communist army with machine guns and bayonets after running out of ammunition and exhausting their supplies and shedding their last drop of blood! The self-defense forces and people in the neighboring towns felt "sympathy for their own kind" and filed complaints with the government. The government officials all consoled them in the same way, saying, "Do not believe rumors and cause unnecessary panic. The government has a perfect plan." "The officials have their reasons." The people dared not ask more and could only return and continue to live day by day in a state of unease.

How Much is Northern Jiangsu Worth? A Small Statistical Attempt

In the eyes of people living in the blessed land south of the Yangtze River, "Jiangbei" (Northern Jiangsu), the birthplace of cart drivers and coolies separated by a large river, has never been much in their minds. Because there are neither beautiful Suzhou and Hangzhou comparable to paradise nor magnificent buildings like Nanjing and Shanghai, it seems to be alright whether they are embraced by the government or temporarily suffer some devastation. The compatriots who grow up there have no smart Western suits to wear and no advanced knowledge to seek, so they have to drift to all directions like abandoned orphans, doing the work of cart drivers and coolies! However, there is a huge amount of produce there, which is indispensable to the people living in the blessed land; it also secures huge economic resources for the country. Apart from the daily necessities such as chickens, ducks, eggs, meat, as well as wheat, beans, cottonseed, corn, and strong and durable homespun cloth, most of which are obtained from Northern Jiangsu, the most important textile raw material, cotton, used to have an annual output of five million dans of cleaned cotton in Northern Jiangsu, which is enough to meet the needs of 1.7 million spindles. The highest quality American cotton also has a production of nearly one million dans in Northern Jiangsu. And the salt of Lianghuai (Huai'an and Huaiyin) has added a lot of revenue to the national treasury. If we make a statistics of these produced materials, the benefits it gives to the country and society are definitely not comparable to the superficial colorfulness in the city, which actually consumes more than it produces! The CCP sees this more clearly than we do, so no matter what, they are unwilling to give up this warehouse easily. However, why are we still so indifferent to this cow, only caring about milking it and not giving it maintenance and rest?

Everyone Says They are for the People, But the People are Squeezed in the Cracks

The suffering of the people living in Northern Jiangsu today is hard to imagine without experiencing it firsthand! Some "progressive gentlemen" who sit in high-rise buildings, loudly calling "go to the people," and waving the "flag of democracy" agree whole heartedly after reading a few dissertations by democratic doctors. If these immortals have the courage to personally run to the real people of Northern Jiangsu for a field stay (you can't see the real situation in the city and in the car), I believe their "progressive" thoughts will immediately shake and not know where to go. The people who live here are in a dilemma, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, under many styles such as "three assets," "struggle," "liquidation," and "emancipation"! If they don't escape, they will surely die, but if they do escape, they can only leave empty-handed in the dead of night, and how can they survive with a bleak future? Even if they are fortunate enough to escape into the government's rule, they are easily suspected of being spies, leaving them with nowhere to stay! The fields in the countryside are deserted, no one goes to plant them, and no one has the heart to work hard again; if they run into the city, there is no work to do! Pure and upright people are confused by the smoky atmosphere everywhere, and they can't wait to find a temple to become a monk; cunning and corrupt people are just right to make a big profit in the troubled waters! Everywhere is a pack of tigers and wolves, and the sky is not seen; but everyone is shouting the same thing, that they are for the people; and the pure and upright people are all squeezed in the cracks, suffering the pain of upper and lower torments! Under this situation, who is happy to work and produce? It is better for everyone to wait for death with their hands in their sleeves. "When will this day end!" Who should be waited for to save them?

Pacification Work is Like Fighting a Fire, and Embers Will Surely Reignite If Not Extinguished

Now, amidst a series of news such as "bandit forces in Northern Jiangsu are acting rashly" and "Communist troops in Southern Shandong are urgently seeking to flee south," the First Pacification Zone is holding an important pacification meeting. Participants in the meeting include Commander Li Mo'an, the responsible officials of the provincial government, the district security commander, the county magistrates, and the military section chiefs. We believe that the mission of this meeting is extremely important, and we hope that its resolutions will achieve greater success. However, based on our on-the-ground investigation in the countryside of Northern Jiangsu for several months, as well as our past experience of living there for a long time, we believe that it is not enough to just set out a few slogans for the suppression work. To learn from past mistakes and prevent future troubles, we must achieve the following key points:

First, it is necessary to deploy sufficient regular military force to thoroughly suppress the bandits. Do not underestimate the enemy and place tasks that cannot be afforded on the limited strength of the self-defense forces, which will only lead to the sacrifice of the people and will not help the matter.

Second, the government must support the growth of self-defense forces, and be cautious in the selection of self-defense and baojia personnel. If self-reformers are given excessive preferential treatment and left unchecked, it will not only lose the people's centripetal force, but also easily cause endless troubles.

Third, political affairs cannot be put on the right track because the bandit scourge has not been completely eliminated. Therefore, military affairs should still be placed first. If the suppression is successful, the people will be protected, good people will voluntarily take up administrative and self-governance work, and political orders will be easily implemented without obstruction; agriculture, industry, and commerce will return to normal, local financial resources will be sufficient, and all waste can be easily eliminated.

Fourth, since the situation in Northern Jiangsu is still different from that in Southern Fujian, the government should not cut its feet to fit the shoe when implementing various political orders, which will only increase the suffering of the people; it should formulate regulations based on the reality of Northern Jiangsu, adapt to local conditions, and not just insist on "matters related to general cases," knowing that it is impossible and forcing it, which will only make the people suffer more! Re-examining the collection of land tax, conscription, and collection of income tax in the 35th year of the Republic of China is necessary in the Northern Jiangsu region, which is full of holes and eagerly awaiting food.

Fifth, the only requirement of the people is to "live and work in peace"; two years ago, the CCP carried out small favors to the people, and many people fell for their tricks! Later, they dragged out the tail of killing and arson, and everyone hated them to the bone, waiting for the government to save them, even more than hunger and thirst. In the future, all facilities must truly think for the welfare of the people, and do not disappoint the people.

Sixth, self-governance and self-defense personnel at all levels should be strictly trained, discipline rectified, strength strengthened, and rewards and punishments clearly defined. National education should also be emphasized to improve the people's knowledge, morality, and ability to distinguish between right and wrong.

We review the past pacification work in Northern Jiangsu, and we cannot say that its achievements are not great; the recovered cities and transportation lines are indeed not few; it is only because those embers hiding in the remote countryside have not been completely extinguished, and the villagers dare not go to the city to report because they have no guarantee; the intelligence of the cities is not flexible and accurate; so many corners of the countryside have been ignored, so that those embers have had the opportunity to reignite! We cherish the ancient saying "a single spark can start a prairie fire; a trickle not stopped will become a river," and we hope that this suppression work by the authorities must strive for "speed," "practicality," and "thoroughness"! Northern Jiangsu is the CCP's "granary"; if they obtain it, they can ensure their rations are sufficient; Northern Jiangsu is also the screen for Nanjing and Shanghai; if we lose it, it will be difficult for Nanjing and Shanghai to remain intact!

### Traces Left on West Lake

— Dui Jie

Hangzhou Dispatch, 18th

Tourists in Hangzhou can be roughly divided into two types: those who "tour the lake" and those who "burn incense." Those who tour the lake are the majority. The boatmen seize this good opportunity, and there is no doubt that they want to put the saying "three winter months rely on one spring" into practice. Not only is the boat fare expensive, but even other prices rise along with it, almost exceeding the market price by several times. This is a thorough "peeling of cucumbers." Last month, it cost only 18,000 yuan to hire a day's boat, at most 24,000 yuan. Recently, it has jumped to 40,000, 80,000, 120,000, and even inexplicably to 160,000. The purpose of touring the lake is to have fun, and a few dollars don't matter, so why haggle with the boatmen? One needs to fix a pot, and the other pot is brought in to sow. If you don't peel the cucumbers, who will?

Don't Peel Double-Layered Cucumbers

Once the interest in touring the lake has subsided, the target shifts to the nearby mountainous areas, such as Hupao (Tiger Spring), Yu Huang Shan (Jade Emperor Mountain), Liuhe Pagoda, and Lingyin Temple. At this time, it is the world of automobiles, pedicabs, and rickshaws. If you have your own car to bring with you, or borrow a car from a local friend, that is an exception. The average tourist cannot escape being peeled like a cucumber once again. If you call a car and ask how much it costs for 20 minutes, they will definitely tell you that there are no cars. If you change your tone and say, "How much does a car cost to go to such and such a place?" Then they will definitely answer you: "There are cars, but the price will be so and so." Bargaining like this ensures that there are no problems. The prices of pedicabs and rickshaws depend on the appearance of the person. If you can persist, although you are being peeled like a cucumber, you will not suffer a big loss. When you reach your destination and go up the mountain, the car cannot go up the mountain anymore. There are sedan chairs to sit on, one pass after another. This is the checkpoint for the chair bearers. They still don't let go of the opportunity to "peel cucumbers." Usually, the cost of the sedan chair includes the round trip. If a sedan chair costs 20,000 yuan, and you give them 40,000 yuan, you have been fooled, because you have been peeled like a double-layered "cucumber"!

Some curious tourists specialize in going to famous restaurants such as Lou Wai Lou (Restaurant Beyond the Building), Tai He Yuan (Supreme Harmony Garden), and Wang Run Xing to eat. They think that these restaurants have good food and cannot miss the opportunity to try them. In fact, they have been peeled like a "cucumber" again. Lou Wai Lou has a good name, but only the West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy is the best dish. Wang Run Xing is an old and prestigious restaurant with several branches, and only two dishes are famous: "Fish Head Tofu" and "Hometown Braised Pork." Of course, the old shop on Zhuzhi Street claims to be the real brand. Tai He Yuan is generally considered to be very expensive, but in fact the price is cheaper than Lou Wai Lou. Only the "Stir-fried Shrimp" is better among all the dishes. As for Hangzhou specialties, such as Longjing tea leaves, Zhang Xiaoquan scissors, Wang Xingji fans, and West Lake umbrellas, there is no reason behind them. The psychology of tourists is partly for souvenirs and partly for gifts, to show at least that they have been to Hangzhou. Based on the psychology of tourists, merchants are able to peel them like "cucumbers."

Stepping Halfway Up the Liuhe Pagoda

Bu Shaofu, the deputy editor-in-chief of Shen Bao and professor at Fudan University, playwright Tian Han, Wu Tian, and famous director Ying Yunwei also rushed to Hangzhou to join in the fun, which kept Chu Yusheng, the special correspondent of Shen Bao in Hangzhou, very busy. One day, they went to visit the Liuhe Pagoda together, guided by Mr. Chu and a commissioner from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The Liuhe Pagoda is thirteen stories high, but they stopped at the sixth floor because there was no way to go any further. At the top of the Liuhe Pagoda, the water of the river flows, and the inspiration of these cultural figures immediately flowed out. Mr. Shaofu also told a joke: "I remember a few years ago, there were three newly married couples who specially ran to the Liuhe Pagoda to hold their weddings in order to seek good luck. As a result, of these three couples, some died and some divorced, all turning into tragedies. The reason is that they only knew "Liu He" (Six Harmonies), but forgot the last word "Ta" (Pagoda), so they had to separate." Everyone laughed a lot after hearing this. The author of "Beast Beast Beast," Wu Ming Shi, also felt the same beauty of the Liuhe Pagoda when he was drinking tea at Fanghe Pavilion. He said, "Standing on the Liuhe Pagoda and looking at the Qianjiang Bridge and the Qiantang River, its beauty is better than touring West Lake."

Talking About Hollywood from Hangzhou

One li (half a kilometer) past the Liuhe Pagoda is Zhejiang University, whose school buildings are not considered the best, but the natural environment is comparable to Tsinghua University. Secretary Wang of Zhejiang University led the tour and explained the origin of "Lingzhi Grass" and "Lovers' Bridge." The more Mr. Wang talked, the more excited he became. Finally, he suggested to our artists to make this place China's Hollywood, and Ying Zhenwei was the first to express his agreement. A reporter expressed disagreement, saying, "What's so good about Hollywood? Can't China create a better film company than Hollywood itself?" A verbal battle ended in everyone's silence.

On the evening of the 3rd, four units of the Hangzhou cultural groups held a tea party at the Youth Center to welcome Tian Han, Bu Shaofu, Ying Yunwei, Wu Tian, and others. Chu Yusheng gave the opening speech, and the participants were very enthusiastic, with about 200 people. They gave speeches one after another. When Mr. Bu gave the last speech, the audience still showed no signs of fatigue. The next day, a newspaper reported: "Mr. Bu Shaofu said that there is a newspaper in the United States that has maintained itself for 14 years without publishing advertisements." A middle school student admired Mr. Bu for his knowledge and experience. He only knew that there was an "afternoon newspaper" in the United States that had been sustained for six and a half years without advertising, but he did not know of one that had been sustained for 24 years." Mr. Bu smiled when he saw this newspaper and said, "This student is really too naive and cute!"

A precious spring outing season is about to pass, but the tourists' enthusiasm is still as strong as ever. One batch leaves, and another batch comes. Constantly coming, constantly leaving.

### Two Calls for Municipal Improvement

Recently, the number of fires in this city has been unprecedented. Although I have heard that there are other reasons, the proliferation of temporary buildings amidst the serious housing shortage is also an important reason. I hereby submit several points of opinion as follows: (1) Please have the city government allocate suburban public land and designate it as a shanty town construction area. (2) Please have the police department strictly crack down on unauthorized construction. (3) Please have the district offices pay attention to the movement of shanty town populations. (4) Please have the Public Works Bureau stipulate the minimum conditions for shanty town construction facilities. (5) In addition to advising disaster-stricken shanty towns to move to the designated locations, they should not be allowed to rebuild on the original site. In addition, Nan Shi Cui Lane, which connects Dong Tong Li Road in the east and Dou Shi Street in the west, has a large number of residents. The lane is full of garbage and lacks street lights at night, making it dirty, dark, and unbearable. I also request the municipal authorities to pay attention to improvement. (Architect Cai Jiren)

Another Letter: I live on Ji'an Road (former French Concession Garre Road Meiquan Lane). Recently, someone fenced off the open space inside the lane at No. 173 and purchased rotten waste paper, piling it up like a mountain. The foul smell is overflowing. In addition to harming the health of nearby residents, this waste paper is also extremely likely to cause a fire. I noticed that fires have been frequently reported in this city recently, and I would like to use a corner of your newspaper to disclose this letter, hoping that the police station in charge will investigate and order the waste paper to be removed as soon as possible for safety. (A Resident of Ji'an Road)

### "Democratic Interlude": Soviet Troops and "People's Representatives" in Lushun and Dalian Perform a Humorous Play

— Han Ji

Plandian, 18th Dispatch

Democratic Style

The meeting opened on April 3rd at the Daishun Cinema (formerly Showaen) and closed on the 4th. From the 2nd, the representatives gathered at the Lushun Municipal Middle School (formerly Shao Gou Public School). For several days, they dined at the Yuanshunju Restaurant and traveled in Soviet cars. In the afternoon of the 2nd, the Soviet military hosted a banquet, followed by various entertainment programs. Finally, they screened a film about the "Zhang Zhaofeng Incident." The meeting commenced at 9:10 AM on the 3rd, with all representatives in attendance. Chen Yuntao, the deputy mayor of the puppet Dalian Municipal Government, presided, and Li Xiuchun, the director of the reception office of the puppet Dalian Municipal Government, served as the reception director. In the center of the venue, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union were hung, along with portraits of Sun Yat-sen and Stalin. Slogans were posted around the venue, mainly promoting increased production, rewarding industry, and popularizing education (emphasizing hygiene, etc.).

The puppet Dalian Municipal Government has been abolished. A puppet "Guandong Public Office" was established in Lushun. This office was formed by the so-called Lushun-Dalian-Jin People's Representative Assembly. The details are as follows: The initiating organization was the Lushun Soviet Military Headquarters. The puppet organizations and groups summoned included the Lushun-Dalian-Jin General Industrial Association, General Commercial Association, Joint Business and People's Association, General Cultural Association, Youth League, Student League, Farmers' Association, Women's Association, County Government, and General Religious Association (Christians, monks, and Taoists), totaling sixteen units. Three hundred and thirteen representatives participated, with the aim of reorganizing the Lushun-Dalian administrative structure, euphemistically called "popular election of personnel."

Reorganization of Institutions

Chen Yun delivered a speech, stating, "In order to reorganize the Lushun-Dalian Joint Office, representatives of various local groups are convened, using local people as the standard, to establish the highest administrative office in Lushun-Dalian," and so on. Subsequently, Chi Zixiang, the director of the puppet Lushun-Dalian Joint Office, reported on the work situation in Lushun-Dalian and the distribution plan for the 350 million yuan public debt. In the afternoon, the reorganization of the Lushun-Dalian puppet administrative structure was discussed. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. Immediately afterward, key representatives and heads of puppet organizations and groups continued to meet until 7:00 PM. That evening, the Soviet military hosted a performance of songs and dances.

Decision on Personnel

The meeting continued the following day. By a show of hands, the organization and personnel election of the Guandong Public Office were formally decided. Subsequently, the puppet secretary-general, Chen Ruiguang, gave a speech, stating, "We thank the Soviet Union for liberating Lushun-Dalian, and the people have gained freedom and democracy. This reorganization of the highest administrative institution is based on the spirit of local people's autonomy to avoid popular unrest. We are non-partisan and based on the Sino-Soviet Thirty-Year Treaty of Friendship, we must support the Soviet Union, avoid struggle, increase capital, and protect the people's lives and property," fully demonstrating the ability to deceive and flatter.

Soviet Military Political Speech

At 8:00 PM that day, a Soviet Major General Staff Officer (name unknown) represented the commander and hosted a banquet for the representatives. During the banquet, the staff officer stood up and delivered a speech (translated by Zhu Xiuchun), stating, "Lushun and Dalian are permanent garrison areas for the Soviet military. No country can interfere, and no country is allowed to station troops here. We hope the representatives convey this to the people, so that local people can govern the locality and complete local autonomy," and so on. After the speech, the puppet secretary-general, Chen Ruiguang, wrote a letter to Marshal Stalin on silk (recorded below), which was personally signed by all the representatives. On the morning of the 5th, after breakfast, the representatives were gathered for a commemorative photograph, and then the meeting was adjourned.

Resolutions

The resolutions are recorded below: (1) The Representative Assembly shall elect fifteen people to form the "Guandong Public Office" to manage all local administrative matters in the Guandong region. (2) The "Guandong Public Office" shall have one chairman, two vice-chairmen, one inspector, one court president, one secretary-general, and one director for each bureau. (3) The "Guandong Public Office" shall have a secretariat and the following departments and bureaus: 1. Department of Civil Affairs, 2. Department of Finance, 3. Department of Industry, 4. Department of Commerce, 5. Department of Transportation, 6. Department of Education, 7. Department of Agriculture, 8. Department of Health, 9. General Bureau of Public Security. (4) The "Guandong Public Office" shall be located in Lushun City. The elected personnel: puppet Chairman Chi Zixiang, puppet Vice-Chairmen Qiao Chuanquan and Liu Xinheng, puppet Inspector Qiao Liqing, puppet Court President Zhou Xudong, puppet Secretary-General Chen Duanguang, puppet Director of Civil Affairs Zhang Zhiyuan, puppet Director of Finance Song Chengzhang, puppet Director of Industry Chen Nili, puppet Director of Commerce Yu Pengjiu, puppet Director of Transportation Pang Tianhai, puppet Director of Education Sun Chenglie, puppet Director of Agriculture Lin Jiyong, puppet Director of Health Yang Fengming, and puppet Director of the General Bureau of Public Security Zhou Guang.

Letter to Stalin

Finally, the reporter may as well record here the original letter from the "People's Representative Assembly" to Stalin: "To Mr. Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: Today we gathered in the city of Lushun, liberated by the Soviet military, to discuss the affairs of our 1.5 million people in the Guandong region and elected our own leadership organ—the Guandong Public Office. ——The people of the Eastern region will never forget the great friendly nation—the Soviet Union—for its friendship and assistance. We deeply understand that only the Soviet Union is the best friend of the Chinese people. May Your Excellency be forever glorious!"

Spring and Autumn Annals

### Continued Notes on Cherishing the Remaining Spring—Fifteenth Dream in Yangzhou

— Hong Weifa

My previous notes on Cherishing the Remaining Spring were only a sketch; there are still many noteworthy events.

Gao Tuozi's given name was Naichao. He first established Keke Residence, and after suffering losses, he reduced its size to Cherishing the Remaining Spring. During the Keke Residence era, it can be further divided into two phases. First, it was located at both ends of the Jiaochang, near today's Chun Garden, and later moved to the middle section of the Jiaochang, the site of today's Yuemingxuan. At first, it was not very large, but later it was magnificent. By the time of Cherishing the Remaining Spring, it felt cramped. My great-great-grandfather once wrote a poem: "A half-roomed hut (or two taverns) can barely accommodate, except for the hunchback, it's vulgar; writing a blue curtain is too desolate, the three words 'Cherishing the Remaining Spring' are heartbreaking." It can be said that his emotions were deeply attached to it.

However, during the Keke Residence era, Tuo Weng left an indelible mark in the area of "miscellaneous Yangzhou snacks." In the past, Yangzhou dim sum used large bamboo steamers, but Keke Residence changed to using smaller sections. Bamboo steamers used to be lined with pine needles, but Keke Residence changed to using white cloth. Although recently, many still use pine needles, valuing their fragrance, using white cloth to line the steamers was pioneered by Tuo Weng. Not only that, but the so-called thousand-layer oil cake and jadeite shaomai (shaomai is also known as "Guipentou," see "Yangzhou Painting Boat Record." Recently, teahouses have written it as "shaomai," which is a mistake.) were also invented by him. Thousand-layer oil cake is used by Yangzhou dim sum shops everywhere to attract customers, because it is not found in other places. As for jadeite shaomai, which is vegetable shaomai, it is sweet, and compared to salty rice shaomai, it has a different flavor. Those who eat Yangzhou dim sum who only know thousand-layer oil cake but do not know jadeite shaomai will always have a regret in terms of their taste.

During the Keke Residence era, Tuo Weng's pastry business was extremely prosperous for a time, but by the time of Cherishing the Remaining Spring, he could no longer sell pastries. Initially, he made and sold some braised dishes and fermented soybeans, but later, probably because the capital became less and less, he could no longer sell even braised dishes and fermented soybeans, so he sold stir-fried shredded pork and braised tofu. Xian's heart was particularly pure and kind, and he was always embarrassed to refuse customers who wanted to keep an account. Later, due to financial difficulties, he would hesitate, but if the customer said, "Are you afraid I won't pay you back?" he would be even more embarrassed to refuse. As the debt increased, the cash decreased, and losses became inevitable. Some of the uninhibited literati who kept accounts at Keke Residence and Cherishing the Remaining Spring improved their circumstances later, but still did not want to pay back the debts, and no longer went to Cherishing the Remaining Spring. When Tuo Weng met these people on the street, he would always turn his head away from a distance. When someone asked him the reason, he said, "So that people won't feel embarrassed when they meet me."

Among the old tea drinkers at Keke Residence and Cherishing the Remaining Spring, although some only knew how to keep accounts and did not want to pay back, betraying the pure and kind-hearted owner, there was another person who inspired the owner, and that was the long-time clerk, Hu San. When the owner closed Keke Residence, everyone else planned to go their separate ways, but Hu San returned to his hometown and sold his only few acres of land to increase capital for the owner, saying, "My owner has lost capital due to his hospitality, and I can also sell my own land for the hospitable owner."

My great-great-grandfather said, "Except for the hunchback, it's vulgar." Tuo Weng's lack of vulgarity lies in his indifference to fame and fortune, and he can also find joy in himself, not taking his increasingly difficult situation to heart. He could pick vegetables inside the counter while murmuring, and occasionally engage in humorous banter with customers. The following is an example. His friend Wang Erqiu was good at playing chess and was also a patron of Cherishing the Remaining Spring. He lived in Thirteen Bay and called himself "Thirteen Bay Resident." Another person, surnamed Guo, lived outside the city at Niansi Bridge and was called a Niansi Bridge customer. One day, just as Wang was about to leave the door of Cherishing the Remaining Spring, Guo happened to arrive. Tuo Weng, who was behind the counter, shouted, "Wang, please stop! I have a couplet to ask you about." Wang asked about the couplet, and Tuo Weng said, "Isn't the current situation a very good couplet? 'Thirteen Bay Resident just left, Niansi Bridge Customer arrives.'" Wang and Guo could not help but clap their hands. It turned out that Tuo had made his own life interesting, and could still find fun in a difficult situation, so he was happy in it. On the sign on the counter of Cherishing the Remaining Spring were the four characters "Life is for Enjoyment," written by Ji Liangong. It seems that Tuo Weng was very able to understand the meaning of "Life is for Enjoyment."

### The Music I Have Heard

— TC

——Memories of an Apprentice's Life

When a grand concert finishes its last note, enthusiastic encore applause and commotion erupt beneath the stage. The musician, smiling, bows repeatedly to his audience in gratitude. Finally, the thick velvet curtain slowly descends, and the audience, filled with satisfaction, disperses from the venue.

After the performers and audience members return home, most of their conversations revolve around the success or failure of the performance, who was there, what they were wearing, and predictions of tomorrow's reviews. As for the music that was performed, they seem not to pay much attention. What we gain from concerts is a social experience, which is also a form of art, but not necessarily an art related to music.

Music, in a small room, in a dark corner, in the rain, and on summer nights, has given us an indescribable feeling. Its sound has resonated with my heartstrings, nourishing my soul and allowing me to deeply understand the depths of the artist's heart. It is incomparably warm and joyful. If you have a simple and unadorned heart, you will understand my words.

Summer is a romantic season. When the cool summer breeze blows towards us, romantic feelings fill us with fantasies. Several friends, with light steps, walk to our good friend Ma's house on Testral Road, in the Yunshang Village—the house of Ma and his sisters. To be honest, going to his house in the morning is somewhat of a headache. Ma is practicing the violin downstairs, and perhaps a beginner is playing etudes in his room. In the next room, his sister is playing the piano, mostly rapid and difficult pieces. His younger sister is also playing the flute upstairs. That huge pile of musical sounds causes many interventions from the neighbors. Entering their house is reminiscent of a morning vegetable market. But the evening—the summer evening—my memory can never erase that kind of atmosphere. The roses in front of his house bloom all over the low fence, and the shadows of the flowers cover Miss Ma's window. Her younger siblings have all stopped their noise. Yao, in the not-so-bright light (electricity conservation was very serious in those years), is playing Chopin's Etude on the most imaginative instrument—the piano. The melody is like a girl sobbing, her long hair covering her face, telling of her love affair. The chords are as fragrant as tuberose, intoxicating the hearts of young people. We eavesdrop in front of her window, and perhaps my eyes have moistened many times. We whisper to each other, "How beautiful!" Those Etudes are too familiar to me. I have heard them dozens or hundreds of times in the music academy's exam program every semester. Friedman and Godowsky's flute recordings are repeatedly played in every living room. But I only recall her dreamlike playing, draped in light gauze.

Chopin, a gentle and affectionate name, belongs to young lovers. My classmate Miss Zhu is practicing her major exam program—Ballada in A major—in the school hall. Her boyfriend Chen and I lean in the piano alcove and listen. Chen explains the story of this Ballade to her, describing the captivating tale of the water nymph: "The moonlight shines charmingly on the surface. The nymphs sit by the pond, laughing and talking. When the unfaithful lover pursues them and falls into the pond, the water ripples, the flowers smile, and the moon becomes even colder." Miss Zhu's eyes glisten with tears. She asks several times, "Really?" "Is it?" Her fingers increase in strength—the strength of love, the feeling of beauty. The piano sound flows gently in my ears like ripples of water. That unfortunate couple, Miss Zhu, went to the United States this spring for further study, and Chen also went to Changzhou Conservatory of Music to pursue a teaching career. Their story disappears like smoke in the sea of life.

"There is no feast that doesn't end." Whenever the music ends and people disperse, it always makes people think of the impermanence of things. Music is the art of time, fleeting in an instant; but it is firmly imprinted in our minds; it lives in our hearts, just as we cherish our deceased good friends, recall past friendships, and silently shed tears. When the spring is bright and the youth are searching for spring scenery in the suburbs, I can't help but remember Miss Wei, my sister's classmate, who accompanied us on a picnic in Zhou's Garden three years ago. She was an outstanding piano student, and when she was preparing for the music academy's graduation exam program, she fell ill, suffering from lung disease due to overwork. Competitive, she endured long years on the sickbed. After half a year of recuperation, she seemed to have regained some health. Coincidentally, someone asked me to play a chamber music piece, and I chose Handel's Sonata No. 4, and also asked her to play this classical work with me. She was very happy. She had played Beethoven's Romance in G for me. We worked together very pleasantly. Although it was a casual performance, she was willing to do some more practice, because she said her fingers were a little awkward after half a year of neglect. The piece was very easy. Even during practice, we would not stop halfway. I could hear her piano sound very clearly. The classical counterpoint, two melodies rising and falling, a kind of harmonious beauty, made people intoxicated in a pleasant game, but this is not enough to describe as a story.

When we stopped practicing, her mother made us some good snacks. Her father and guests praised our performance. This made her even more excited. The biggest piece for her graduation exam was Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto in Bb. Although she hadn't practiced on the piano for half a year, she had reviewed it in her heart all the time. Suddenly, she put down her teacup, ran to the piano and sat down. The keys, under her agile touch, cried out a song of sorrow from the great master. Her cheeks were flushed, her breathing gradually shortened, her fingers seemed to be trembling, the music stopped on an altered chord, a faint smile floated on her tense lips, and she said, "I can still play!"

I have heard pianists and orchestras play this famous piece at the Lyceum Theatre. Wu Leyi played it very well. She made me feel very relieved. Dong Guangguang's name and the effect of the first three chords of this piece are very similar. Please forgive me, I may not have brought back other memories from the theater. Rubinstein is a world-renowned authority on this piece. We cannot doubt the value of these masters' performances, but it was Miss Wei's fragment of performance that shook my heart violently.

A few days later, our small concert was performed, and she still seemed very happy. I asked her to go on a picnic to Zhou's Garden. She said, "I can't eat anything, but it's good to walk around." That day, I took the last few photos of her. Not long after returning home, the knife was heavily back on the sickbed. Later, I never saw her again. Her tombstone may be sprouting new buds, but I don't know where she is buried. Whenever I hear this Piano Concerto in B-flat minor, I seem to see the back of her head with two braids, the side of her face with flushed cheeks, and the shy voice, singing a mournful tune; through her, I see the sorrowful face of this northern master, shedding tears of passion for the despairing fate of all mankind.

Friend, this is some of the music I have heard. Do you think it is too sentimental? Isn't it? (The day after Qingming, 36th year)

### Spring Night

— Li Baifeng

After the cold winter,

The hibernating vagrants,

Like insects startled after torpor,

Appear again in the city.

It must be the city dweller’s uneasy dream;

This wreath of neon lights

Is full of unease and fear.

The city manufactures sin,

The graveyard of civilization——

How many girls who pick up rouge on the streets

Think of the wasteful opulence

Built with the bones of people,

And in their wine glasses,

Red is blood, white is tears…

I cannot bear it,

This cold spring in the human world.

(1947.4. In spring loneliness)

### Sonnet

— Sikong Wuji

The seagull of the soul flies over the illusory peaks.

Zhizhi holds the songpipe, causing it to rise and fall!

Following the rhythm of the music, embrace the wise Veres in a gray embrace. Faith listens attentively to the delicate, round breath.

May your innocent footsteps enter the deep steps. Thank you to the holy eyes for pardoning the sins of the separated from the prison of death;

Allow me along the edge of the light green dress factory,

Explore the free prairie of the continuous Que Lian.

Ah, the song of the Filipino wanderers!

Is so sad!

What about my vague and warm dream?

However, it casts many frozen ripples in the shadows of the dance floor lights.

Resent the too short time, hide hope into the deep house of the night;

I pray for tomorrow’s big sun, to make you smile more brightly!

(April 11th, Wu Lan, Baisheng Intercourse: Written here.)

### Kiss

— Huan Xiu

Why not let

The dewdrops on the tip of the grass

Merge with the earth,

To nourish transient life

And live forever in the stimulation of wind and rain?

Why not bring down

The prize of life held high,

And heavily strike it out,

To sail in the boundless ocean

To the shore of eternity?

Since “Truth” is giving,

And “Beauty” is not taking;

Let joy and pain,

Happiness and tears,

Kiss each other forever.

### Spring Thoughts

— Li Guo

——Sent to Lin La

I stand by the village quietly listening

The northwest wind blows the camel bell

It seems someone is calling

Could that be your thoughts

I stroll in the green forest

Bees broadcast the fragrance of flowers

It sounds like someone is sighing softly

Could that be your melancholy

The morning light is reflected in the stream

Two small crucian carp are teasing the sun

A few whirlpools float on the water surface

Could those be your smiles

I wake up from a dream

Larks fly and sing outside the building

The warm wind opens my gauze window

Could that be your song

(36.4. Red Paper Gallery)

### Shakespeare the Thinker

(British Information Service Special Article)

What is the secret of Shakespeare’s greatness? There is no single answer to this question. Some say it is the wonder and melody of his poetry; many, however, believe it is his amazing ability to create characters, because he can make these characters appear as alive in speech and action. From the actor’s point of view, Shakespeare the playwright creates characters who are most suited to the actor’s ideals, and his plays are also the most entertaining in the theater. But in the excitement and bewitching emotions of watching a play, we often overlook the great poet’s ability to “think.”

Shakespeare’s thoughts were not only true in his own time, but are still true now, and will always be true. He can express human virtues and sins, personality problems, and problems of entire lives in a simple sentence, and make people never forget.

The world all hopes to be famous, whether as a famous poet, politician, soldier, artist, or writer; but the world has also witnessed examples of famous people falling into disgrace and a lifetime of hardship. Now let us imagine being at Westminster Palace in London, standing in a small, desolate room is a great pastor, suspiciously looking at a door that has just been closed; and saying to himself:

"How limited is the good heart that used to support me! I have lost my prominent position from now on! How fickle is human destiny! Because of the hope of early fame, everything has been accomplished in adulthood, but once fame is achieved, an unexpected blow comes from the side, thus ending my career. In my past political career, I once went forward regardless of all dangers, now I realize that I have been too demanding of power, I have always let my arrogant heart lead, and now this arrogant heart can no longer help me. I am old and tired, surrounded by jealousy and resentment, losing self-esteem, and worldly fame and power become so empty and hateful!"

The above passage is undoubtedly a truth about something that mankind values very much, expressed by a great thinker. This thinker is not Wolsey, who said these words, but Shakespeare, who expressed his thoughts through his mouth. What he said was a truth three hundred years ago. These concepts not only give people a deep impression in themselves, Shakespeare also deepened their impression with poetry, eloquence, and melody.

No matter what topic we use to examine Shakespeare’s thoughts, even if we express it in modern language, we can discover that his thoughts contain great power and lasting truth. In modern life, we still often seem to hear the voice of Shakespeare's truth. To solve the problems of modern life, should we turn to Shakespeare's works and refer to his views on England three centuries ago?

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 407

— Ye Jingfeng

Tsurumi immediately examined the original small envelope carefully on both sides, and was relieved to see no signs of tampering. He carefully opened the original envelope, only to find another envelope inside. This smaller envelope had only four small characters on it: "Ping'er's Hand."

Seeing these testing words, Tsurumi seemed hesitant again. All five people focused their eyes on the small envelope, their expressions quite tense. Tsurumi hesitated for a moment, then took a small knife from his pocket and carefully picked open the seal. He himself did not understand why he was being so fussy. Perhaps it was precisely because he was thinking of Elder Aoki and his strange mystery, which made him feel somewhat apprehensive.

Once the envelope was opened, Tsurumi pulled out the letter paper inside, and at first glance, he saw a thin piece of white paper, seemingly without any writing, and his face immediately changed. But when they unfolded the letter paper, everyone was stunned with surprise; it turned out that there were indeed no words on the paper, only a circle drawn with black ink in the center of the paper, about the size of a silver dollar. It was obviously drawn casually, but it was very round.

"What is this thing? …This weird old man!" Tsurumi was so surprised that he forgot himself and began muttering in Japanese.

Li Ming, Han Fangdai, and Zheng Yan, the three Special Number Two agents, were already somewhat baffled by the mysterious letter. When they heard Tsurumi muttering about "the old man," they were even more confused since they didn't know who he was referring to. Only Shou Yi, who had heard Jue Chang Lao Ren explain the so-called secret "Da Luo Ling Shu" of our country using scientific methods at Bai Ren Manor, guessed that this mysterious letter was probably some kind of telepathic trick and nothing to get excited about.

"I suspect the person who sent the letter, 'the old man,' is a follower of the 'Eastern Sect'?" Shou Yi asked Tsurumi casually.

"You're absolutely right." Tsurumi seemed to wake up from a dream, looking at Shou Yi with an expression of extreme admiration. "I heard that this Elder Aoki, Miss Nakamura's mentor, received the authentic transmission of esoteric Buddhism, which the Japanese call 'Eastern Sect.' Do you know something about it, brother?…"

"I don't understand," Shou Yi shook his head. "Someone at the manor might understand. I remember my late uncle, Jue Chang Lao Ren, lectured on it… On the passive side, this trick is what novels often refer to as 'a sudden impulse,' or what ordinary people experience as 'heart palpitations…restlessness,' and so on. On the active side, there's 'the mother biting her finger,' the 'swearing oaths' of rural women, and even actions like 'the old woman scolding the chicken,' which can all be counted as part of it… The 'telepathy' recently studied by the West is also part of this. It's probably nothing more than some 'heavenly eye' or 'remote hypnosis' under the guise of 'applied psychology'…"

"That's great!" Tsurumi's spirits lifted again. "Since the old master Jue Chang at your manor has studied it, he will surely be able to explain this secret. Please…"

"Alright," Shou Yi knew that Tsurumi wanted him to ask the manor about this matter, and he also had this intention. "I'll take this thing back and ask the old man to take a look."

"Thank you, thank you," Tsurumi was somewhat incoherent. "Please… So, to get back to the point, we need to return to the issue of Miss Nakamura. We've been rambling on and on, and we still haven't asked this brother to announce the information he found…" Tsurumi looked at the representative of Han Fangdai and nodded, expressing his apologies.

### Random Musings While Docked

— Wang Cong

A child, the moment it is born, cries with its entire life; it seems to be lodging a protest against this difficult and painful world.

An old man, when he has completed his life's ideals and is turning back to bid farewell to that beautiful history, often emits a heartfelt smile. That smile is so innocent and so peaceful and thought-provoking.

Both this crying and this smiling fill me with longing. However, I love the latter's smile even more than the former's. I say:

"The first cry of mankind is not as close to beauty and poetry as the last smile."

In a certain sense, three people living together can be more lonely than two people living together.

I fear loneliness, but I fear even more throwing myself into philistine banquets. My aversion to noise is like that of an ancient criminal seeing a pillory.

Inexplicable is the inclination to drink poison to quench one's thirst. When "I have esteemed guests, playing the zither and blowing the pipes," although I do not have Meng Chang's ambition to "sing a generous and sorrowful song," even greater loneliness permeates with depression, and ultimately I cannot finish the feast.

"Officials fill the capital, yet this man alone is haggard." These are lines of poetry that I have deeply loved since I was a child. I think it is precisely because the capital has countless officials that the haggardness of this man is particularly precious.

I often secretly wish for the health of many friends. But when I find that a friend has become thin, I feel particularly close to him.

### Digressions

— Huai Bao

In the past few days, trains have been derailing one after another, making travelers panic and almost afraid to go out. Derailments are not unprecedented, but coming after the previous plane crash, the fact that trains are derailing one after another is unsettling.

The reasons for derailments, like the causes of fires, can be enumerated at length; however, the most obvious reason is always the long-term disrepair of the rails, with the underlying sleepers rotten and unable to bear the weight of the train, with the possibility of collapse at any moment. Since the War of Resistance, these railways have not been properly maintained, and by now, the sleepers are naturally rotting and the screws are rusting. Any road must be constantly maintained to remain in good condition. Now, if you stop for ten years, how can there not be problems?

This responsibility, of course, does not lie with the railway authorities, because during the occupied period, their reach was limited, and it was something that could not be helped. However, after the victory and restoration, the authorities must actively take responsibility. Adjusting the vehicles, increasing the number of trips, and reducing passenger crowding are certainly extremely important, but the safety and reliability of the journey seem to be even more important. In the past, many people switched to trains because flying was dangerous; but if trains are now as prone to accidents as airplanes, it gives people the feeling that "there is nowhere to go." If one absolutely has to travel, I am afraid that one can only take a step back from trains and take inland river steamboats (who knows what they will be like at that time?) or simply sit in a rickshaw or even walk.

People are trying to apply atomic energy to civil industry, but we are risking driving on rotten sleepers. The fact that people want to use primitive means of transportation is not a question of temporary backwardness versus progress, but of whether or not one is willing to constantly seek progress. Railways were originally a new thing, but in this era of continuous innovation, they are no longer at the forefront. However, it is still constantly innovating. Comparing this situation with the millions of rotten sleepers lying under our rails is truly worrying. How can these tattered pieces of iron be regarded as antiques, let alone national treasures?

### "Influence Peddling"

— Wu Bian

In today's world of rampant corruption, how many people in our society are relying on their relationships with women to make connections with powerful people, cultivate relationships, and use nepotism to plead for favors and go through back channels in order to achieve their goals of promotion and wealth. In "Influence Peddling," the general manager Deng, who is both an official and a businessman, is a formidable and invincible figure. Many people flatter and bow to him, but he also has to pay homage to his superior's wife. He sends Secretary Ma to accompany them in playing cards, and has already stipulated that they are only allowed to lose and not to win, and even the more they lose, the better. This is such a cynical satire on reality by the playwright! In addition, relying solely on his wife's words, he appoints his own brother-in-law to a key position that only an expert could handle. Later, his wife changes her mind in order to protect her unmentionable secret, and General Manager Deng has no choice but to reassign that aquaculture expert to Nanping Island. This is precisely a portrait of those who consider themselves members of the upper class. In this society where influence peddling is rampant, everything is as unreasonable as in this story. Now the author ruthlessly exposes them to the audience, using satire to lash out at this group of corrupt figures.

This is a play with rich and realistic content, but we were somewhat disappointed with the performance. If memory serves, "Influence Peddling" was once performed on stage by the Shanghai Drama Society. Compared to the stage version of "Influence Peddling," which had a brilliant record, the film version is far inferior. In particular, the ending of the film, where Chen Jiannan accepts General Manager Deng's assignment to Nanping Island, is a highly inappropriate adaptation.

The reason why audiences who have seen the stage play are dissatisfied with the film performance is the way director Li Pingqing handled the comedy "Influence Peddling." He did not appropriately grasp the genre, tone, or rhythm of the play. He only gave a perfunctory account of the development of the plot, without in-depth portrayals of these characters and events. When the story progresses to near the end, it should be rapid and headlong, like wind sweeping away fallen leaves, but he arranges it so slowly, filling the progress of the play with some unnecessary details, resulting in a loose and weak performance. This is regrettable.

Shu Jiwen, who had a brilliant career on the stage in the Great Rear Area, did not bring any special achievements here. Her portrayal of the general manager's wife lacked the necessary style and aura. Zhou Boxun's General Manager Deng was excellent, and his creation of the character's personality and physical appearance was quite successful. Feng Zhe's Chen Jiannan performed just right. Ding Ran's Secretary Ma had a slightly too theatrical feel, and Yang Wei's Chen Baiqi was one of the best among the female roles, lively, subtle, and natural.

### Strange Tales From a Studio

— Zhou

Seeing the film advertisements and reviews in the Shanghai newspapers, with the title of the four great writers, including Wells, to attract audiences to "New Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," it seems that it is not selling well. With the help of Western material civilization, such films, I think, can be regarded as a tool for creating psychiatric patients. It is said that dozens of British and American scientists are still studying the existence of the soul; their literary circles are also selling monster stories and detective novels, but people with neurasthenia are not suitable for such "education."

In China, there is no need for "New Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" to help, and the bizarre and strange situations in society are more than enough to make the common people suffer from mental illness. The other day, a Shanghai newspaper published a message entitled "Crazy Prices? Or Crazy People?" The article said that a citizen of Shijiazhuang went shopping, and because the asking price was too high, it stimulated his nerves, and he fainted on the road. This story is probably not a product of writers who are divorced from reality, and there are many similar stories. Not long ago, the newspaper reported that an old woman who had not been shopping for a long time went to buy a pound of pork, but she only had a few ten-yuan bills with her.

All works of art are products of reflecting reality. The reason why "New Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" is not popular may be that the "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio atmosphere" of Chinese reality has far surpassed the movie stories, right?

### Listening to Air Music—Expectations for the Chinese Harmonica Society

— Yang Pingzhang

On the evening of the 20th, the Chinese Harmonica Society held a grand air harmonica concert at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station. All the pieces played were world-famous pieces, such as "Serenade," "Spanish Waltz," and "Double Eagle March." Also, the society's president, Mr. Wang Qinglong's "National Glory Trilogy" was also on the program. All of this performance can be said to be an unprecedented event in the harmonica world.

The program included solo performances by Wang Qinglong and Wang Qingrui, duets, and large ensembles by the society's symphony orchestra and accordion band. The famous accordionist Mr. Kade Baotuer also played several famous pieces. When that kind of energetic and nostalgic movement stirred up a melodious melody in the quiet air, it made people feel infinitely excited; the inner heart showed excitement and cheers with the changes in the tune. Especially Mr. Wang Qinglong's solo performance was really extremely beautiful.

Regarding musical technicalities, the author is an amateur, so I dare not criticize randomly. However, in today's music scene, it is gratifying to see such achievements being expressed.

Today's Shanghai is full of decadent sounds; therefore, people's mouths are also full of those intoxicating popular songs. When we turn on the radio, almost all of the music programs are occupied by popular songs, and it is rare to hear world-famous pieces and symphonies. I hope that the Chinese Harmonica Society can hold air concerts often in the future, so that countless people can temporarily put aside the busy and noisy world after work and quietly share a little spiritual food.

And I hope that the Chinese Harmonica Society will continue to work hard and shine brightly for China's music scene.

### Climbing Incense Burner Peak, Exploring Yu's Cave—Travels in Shaoxing, Zhejiang

— Mei Sheng

By chance, a few friends and I went to Shaoxing. The next morning, we boarded a small boat and rowed to the Yu Wang Temple, about seven or eight miles from the city. From afar, we saw the towering temple standing among the mountains, very much like the Jingci Temple of West Lake towering at the foot of Nanping Mountain. Inside, the painted rafters and carved beams, and the grand structure still exist, but all kinds of offerings, except for the solitary statue of King Yu in the center, are all empty. After several wars, it is no wonder.

To the left of the temple is the "Empty Stone Pavilion." A stone block measuring one zhang stands in the center, with a hole in the top. According to the stele inscription, ancient monarchs often pressed a large stone on their coffins. It was probably discovered in this way that the location of Yu's Mausoleum was first measured. A lifetime of worry, a thousand years of temple worship, and great achievements will naturally be immortal.

Leaving Yu's Mausoleum and heading towards Incense Burner Peak, at the beginning of the mountain, the road is paved with large stones, winding upwards, and gradually becomes higher, but it is not strenuous. After passing Toutian Temple, we climb straight up the steps behind the temple. The peak is steep and the road is narrow, and we already feel tired. Afterwards, the climb becomes steeper, and looking up, it is still impossible to climb. We walk and walk again, rest and rest again, and when we climb to Zhongtian Temple, we are already panting unbearably. Mountain children carry bamboo canes for sale, which is exactly what we need. The price is only one hundred yuan, which makes us feel happy. It can be seen that the mountain residents are honest and simple, and there is absolutely no speculative extortion.

Having a bamboo cane is like having an extra leg. We support ourselves and climb again. Because the mountain is high and the walls are steep, iron railings are built along the road to prevent accidents. After climbing three or four hundred steps more, we finally reach the top of Incense Burner Peak.

In front of the Bodhisattva statue, the incense is burning vigorously. After eating and resting a little, we leisurely look around from the top of the peak. The mountains are all lying at our feet, and white clouds are spitting out from under our feet. The surrounding pine wind and the sound of ten thousand valleys are roaring and rustling, and we want to rise up and leave. Looking into the distance, the cities and rivers are like insects, sand, and mustard seeds. The openness and depth are something that those who have been confined to the mortal world for a long time cannot even dream of. Even we, who often climb the north and south peaks of the bright West Lake, have the feeling of "once you have seen the clouds of Wushan, no other clouds are worth a glance." The magnificence and beauty are truly worthy of being the second peak of Tianzhu.

Although going down the mountain is easier than going up the mountain, the stone steps are slippery and dangerous. If you are not careful, you may fall. Falling down is a cliff of ten thousand zhang, and you will immediately become pulverized powder. The vicissitudes of life and going up and down the mountain can be a wonderful reference.

### The Capital's "Appendix"

— Yi Feng

Anyone who has never been to the capital city cannot help but have some longing for the Confucius Temple. Because it is a "place of scenic beauty" from the "Six Dynasties powder and gold" period.

However, when you actually get to the Confucius Temple, if you don’t have a lot of money, your sightseeing will be in vain. In the current situation of bright lights and bustling noise, it is impossible for you to calm down and reflect on the past. The Qinhuai River and Taoye Ferry written by the predecessors are far away. A stagnant pool of water tells you that this place has already rotted and stinks.

Let's just talk about the temple: it is quite lively during the day, with a dark crowd of people coming in and out, naturally all to explore the scenery and sightsee. Inside the temple, there are many stalls, including food stalls, department store stalls, all kinds of stalls. If a newcomer to the capital city cannot find a way to buy furniture, this can solve this problem. In addition, a piece of open space has become the world of street performers, but they are all very cheap. At night, the activities in the temple stop, and the outside of the temple becomes a paradise for adventurers. Prostitutes, singers, guides, and meat markets are all available. From dusk, the doors of those wine and teahouses, such as Liuhua Spring and Jin Valley, are crowded with vehicles. The streamlines and jeeps form a line, implying that their owners are enjoying themselves at the table. Pimps and madams stand on the street, humming like bees. A single pedestrian, especially someone visiting the temple for the first time, may be startled by a sudden sound in their ear. There are big drums and rehearsals in the teahouses. After the gentlemen are drunk and full, that place becomes their only supper spot. The tea fee is over five thousand yuan a cup, and the place is always packed. I dare not say whether they go for real entertainment, but there are many who are there for other reasons besides tea. It is too unromantic to prohibit the Eight Masters from entering the teahouse, but the high-ranking officials can change into a set of dark blue uniforms and enjoy themselves freely without restraint. Therefore, some people say that the Confucius Temple is the capital's appendix, which does not seem unreasonable.

### Arts and Literary Circles

Mao Dun and his wife boarded the Soviet ship Smolny on the 25th of this month to return to China. At 4 pm that afternoon, the cultural figures who greeted them at the Jianghai Customs Wharf included Guo Moruo, Ye Shengtao, Kong Lingjing, Ge Baoquan, Xu Tiaofu, Qi Shimei, Chen Baiyi, Yang Yisheng, Fan Quan, Fu Binran, Ye Yiqun, Luo Jia, and the Russian Rogov and others. After Mao Dun landed, he shook hands with everyone one by one, and when he shook hands with Guo Moruo, he gave him a warm embrace.

### Chronicle of a City in Crisis

— Qin Shouou

"Xiao Rong, good boy, listen to Mom! Leave it behind!" Lan wanted to use reason to persuade Rong'er. "How much does your sister like you? Uncle Zhu taught her to sit in a good car, but she was reluctant and let you sit, let you go to Chongqing first. Why are you still unwilling to let her play with Rabbit Daddy for a day?… Soon, maybe tomorrow or the day after, we will be leaving too, and I can still return it to you on the road…."

But it is still a little too early to reason with a five-year-old child.

"No! No! Rabbit Daddy was bought for Xiao Rong by Grandma!" He insisted on not letting go, and he also had his reasons.

"Isn't it the same if you give it to your sister? She won't lose it for you!" Lan still wanted to persuade him, her tone becoming a little harder.

Xiao Rong pouted his little mouth, hugged his beloved object tightly with both hands, stared his eyes, and still did not give in.

"I won't! I want to take it with me!"

"Go! Go! Go!" Lan became angry and did not say anything more. She picked up a small handkerchief bag and walked out of the house first.

Rong'er did not have time to chase after her, afraid that his mother would leave and his sister would snatch it from him; but Fei Fei did not move at all, standing blankly at the door, feeling an unspeakable sense of disappointment in her heart.

"Fei Fei! Eat candy!" Old Zhu, with the psychology of sympathizing with the weak, immediately took out three or four candies from his pocket and stuffed them into Fei Fei's little hands, and gently said on the side, "This is better than what I gave Xiao Rong just now!"(46)
