### Fond Farewell from Elders of Xikou, Chairman and Madam Fly to Hangzhou, Afternoon Visit to Yu the Great's Mausoleum in Shaoxing

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 11th] Chairman Chiang and Madam arrived in Hangzhou by plane at 12:00 noon today. The first batch of his entourage arrived at Jianqiao Airport at 8:45 this morning. Before departing this morning at 10:00, Chairman Chiang and his wife first paid their respects at Madam Chiang's mother's tomb. Then, they went to Wuling School in Xikou to address the school's more than one thousand students, earnestly encouraging each student to become a good citizen. Afterwards, they bid farewell to the elders of Xikou. Chiangâ€™s clan leader, Wenbing, and others wished Chairman Chiang and his wife good health and hoped they would return to Xikou next Qingming Festival. Chairman Chiang and his wife responded, "Good," and wished the elders good health, urging them to take care and return home. Chairman Chiang turned to hug his grandson, Aiguo, saying "Goodbye," with warmth and kindness. Then, he and his wife took their grandson, Aiming, to the airport, boarding the "Meiling" special plane to Hangzhou. Upon arrival, they took up residence at the official residence at No. 49 Yingbai Road. Accompanying Chairman Chiang were Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Yu Jishi, Director of the General Affairs Bureau Chen Xizeng, Secretaries Zhou Hongtao and Cao Shengfang, and Aide-de-Camp Shi Juemin. Chief of the Guard, Shi Zude, remained behind and did not come to Hangzhou. After Chairman Chiang and Chiang Ching-kuo and their wives rested briefly at the official residence and had lunch, they went to Shaoxing at 2:45 PM with Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie to pay their respects at Yu the Great's Mausoleum. Hearing the news of Chairman Chiang's arrival, all people in Shaoxing County were extremely excited. On the way from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing, Chairman Chiang frequently pointed out the traces of destruction left by the Japanese puppets and instructed that they be repaired. They arrived in Shaoxing at 4:45 PM, where the people of the county lined the streets to welcome them. After resting briefly at the County Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Chiang and his party went to the Yu the Great Temple to offer sacrifices. He instructed Commissioner Zheng Xiaoyin and County Magistrate Lin Ze to repair all damaged parts of the Yu the Great Temple. The descendants of Yu, the Si clan, all came to pay their respects.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 11th] This afternoon, Chairman and Madam Chiang traveled from Hangzhou to Shaoxing to visit Yu the Great's Mausoleum to sweep the tomb. They returned to Hangzhou at 6:20 PM, arriving at 7:30 PM. They will stay in Hangzhou tonight and return to Nanjing in a day or two.

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 11th] Chairman Chiang arrived at the South Gate of Shaoxing at 5:00 PM this afternoon. He transferred to a motorboat and went directly to Yu the Great's Mausoleum. After resting briefly, he paid homage before Yu the Great's statue and presented a wreath. After a light refreshment, he looked around Yu the Great's Mausoleum for a moment, leaving at 6:00 PM. At about 8:00 PM, he returned to the Hangzhou Xing Yuan (temporary residence) to rest. Yu the Great's Mausoleum is located in Kuaiji Mountain in the southeast of Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province. During the Song Dynasty's Qiande period, the Yu the Great Temple was established in Kuaiji. During the Ming Dynasty's Hongwu period, people were forbidden to collect firewood. Chairman Chiang deeply respected his character and achievements and took the time to visit the mausoleum.

### Welcoming the Chairman on the Shores of West Lake

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Since the victory until now, for more than a year, the people of Fenghua Xikou, Chairman Chiang's hometown, have been eagerly awaiting his arrival. However, because he is responsible for the safety of the whole country and has many things to deal with, it was not until April 2nd this year that he made the journey back. He stayed in his hometown for a full nineteen days. He deeply felt the loyalty and love of the elders and younger generations in his hometown. He was delighted by this warmth. The people of Hangzhou also missed news of Chairman Chiang. Although he graciously visited in the spring of the second day after the victory, they still hoped for another opportunity to see the lofty and great Chairman Chiang.

In the past two days, Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Vice President Wei Daoming, and National Defense Committee Secretary-General Wang Chonghui have all come to Hangzhou from Nanjing for sightseeing. Mr. Chen Guofu and Mr. Chen Lifu, who went to Wuxing from Nanjing to sweep the tomb, also turned to Hangzhou. Many sensitive people in Hangzhou were speculating: "Chairman Chiang is also coming!"

On the afternoon of the 10th, we received the news that the Dahua Hotel on the shore of West Lake had reserved rooms for the Hangzhou Municipal Government. As a result of our inquiries everywhere, we learned: "The chairman plans to come to Hangzhou, but the day of his arrival has not been decided." On the afternoon of the 10th after 5 PM, the chairman decided in Xikou to make a stop in Hangzhou. The news only reached Hangzhou at 6:00 AM on the 11th.

That morning, two planes carrying the entourage first took off from Ningbo Xiangshan Airport to prepare everything in Hangzhou.

Chairman Chiang woke up very early that day, as usual, and walked with his wife to Wuling School to address all the teachers and students. With sincerity, kindness and affection, Chairman Chiang told many teachers and students that they should be disciplined and be good citizens. The Madam also said the same. After the speech, the Chairman and his wife boarded the prepared car to the airport. Chairman Chiang and his wife waved, held their hats, nodded, and boarded the plane.

At nearly 12:00 noon, Chairman Chiang's plane appeared in the sky over Hangzhou. Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie, Chairman of the Provincial Party Department Zhang Qiang, Deputy Commander of the Security Zhu Mingtao, and Mayor of Hangzhou Zhou Xiangxian, were waiting anxiously for the arrival of the Chairman at the airport.

The plane gradually descended, gliding to a stop on the airport runway. Chairman Chiang appeared at the door of the aircraft, radiant and wearing a black Chinese jacket over a blue gown, while his wife, wearing a black cheongsam, stepped down from the plane. The Air Force Military Academy band played a ceremonial fanfare and the national anthem. Then, the Chairman nodded in return to those who welcomed him, and the Education Director of the Air Force Academy, Hu Weike, requested the Chairman to inspect the officers and soldiers. Chairman Chiang nodded in return.

After resting briefly in the Air Force Academy's auditorium, they boarded the prepared car to the official residence at No. 49 Yingbai Road.

Chairman Chiang, this benevolent and lofty giant, has come to Hangzhou twice. This indicates his concern for the lives of the people of Zhejiang, and his love for the beauty of these lakes and mountains. However, we in Zhejiang must think quietly! He cares so much for us, how should we repay him? (Chu Yusheng)

### Chairman Allocates Funds for Urgent Relief to Aid Refugees in Jiaoji and Dehui

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] Chairman Chiang is concerned about the suffering of refugees in Dehui affected by the war. He has specially ordered the allocation of 50 million yuan in circulating currency, instructing the Executive Yuan to order the Northeast Security Commander's Office and other agencies to go to Dehui to distribute the funds. It is understood that the relevant agencies have dispatched personnel carrying relief funds to Dehui, and they have organized an emergency relief fund distribution committee in the area, which completed the distribution yesterday.

### Chen Guofu and Others Pay Respects to the Chairman

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 11th] Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, and others went to the official residence on Yingbai Road at 1:00 PM on the 11th to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and talk with him. They bid farewell shortly afterwards and took the 2:00 PM train to Shanghai to return to Nanjing.

### National Army in Southern Shandong Strengthens Pacification Work, Fierce Fighting on Both Sides of the Subei Haitai Line

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 11th] In order to strengthen the pacification work in the rear, the National Army in Southern Shandong has recently eliminated the scattered Communists in the areas on both sides of the Linzao and Taizao branch lines. More than 2,000 Communists, fleeing eastward through Jinlingsi from north and south Tangyin, were ambushed by the National Army in Nigou on the 10th. More than a hundred were captured alive, and the remaining Communists fled eastward in disarray. They were surrounded again by the National Army in Xingjialou, 15 kilometers northeast of Taierzhuang, on the morning of the 11th and are being annihilated. Furthermore, there are no Communist troops in the vicinity of Xiji and Qicun.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] While a major battle in the mountainous areas of Southern Shandong is still brewing, it was reported on the 11th that the main Communist forces in the Yishui area consist of five columns, those in Xintai, Laiwu, and Mengyin consist of three columns, those near Feixian consist of one column, and those outside Jinan are the Tenth Column, which is a combination of the Jie Qi and Jie Eleven Divisions and the Police Seventh Brigade. In recent days, the Communists have been actively transporting weapons and ammunition to the mountainous areas from various places, while non-combatants and supplies are being transported to the Lijin and Zhanhua areas on the north bank of the Yellow River. Fearing that the National Army will land along the coast, the Communists have now established a coastal defense headquarters, with a region extending from Xinpu to Qingdao. There is no war on the Jiaoji Line, and the National Army guerrillas can reach Zhangqiu.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 11th] On the 10th, the National Army continued to launch a large-scale mopping-up operation against the remnants of the Communist forces in the Laoguanzui and Wulingji areas north of Junxian, achieving considerable gains.

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 11th] After the Battle of Libao, the remnants of the Communist forces in Subei are now fleeing to both sides of the Haitai Line to harass the area. County Magistrate Ding of Taixian led the entire security force to Jiangyan to suppress them, and fierce fighting has been going on on both sides of the road for days.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 11th] The remnants of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces in northern Henan are now in a desperate situation. The remnants of their 236th and other columns fled to the area east of Tangyin and west of Neihuang on the afternoon of the 10th. Their Independent One and Independent Two Brigades and the Seventeenth Division have fled to the northwest of Tangyin. The National Army is currently tracking and pursuing them.

### No Progress in Receiving Dalian, Gong Xuesui Postpones Departure, Communist Army is Using Dalian as a Supply Depot

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 11th] The reception of Dalian is progressing like a snail climbing a wall, with no progress at all. Gong Xuesui was originally scheduled to come north today, but the date has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. According to sources from Shenyang who came to Beiping today, there are many difficulties in receiving Dalian: (1) The Soviet Union has notified the government that the area of Dalian to be received is limited to a narrow area west of the railway line, which is only half of the urban area of Dalian in 1936. Compared with the "Greater Dalian" urban area expanded by Japan in 1941, it is even more pitiful. Furthermore, Yaoziwo, the source of water for Dalian, has also been designated by the Soviet side as an area for the Soviet garrison. Dalian has been dismembered in this way and is no longer a city. (2) The Soviet side does not agree to the National Army's garrisoning of Dalian, and only police security teams can go there to maintain order. Furthermore, the Soviet side has repeatedly stated recently that it hopes Chinese administrative personnel will go to receive the area first. Under the situation of the Communist army controlling Dalian, unarmed administrative personnel, once they enter, may become prisoners, and there is no possibility of receiving the area. The spokesperson also pointed out that the Communist army is currently using Dalian as a supply depot for its Shandong operations and will never easily give it up. (3) Regarding Pulandian, although negotiations have been held between the Chinese and Soviet military, the Soviet representatives are of very low rank and cannot be held responsible, and the representatives are often changed, so no results have been achieved. (4) In addition to the above, there are many basic difficulties in receiving Lushun and Dalian. The Chinese and Russian texts of the Sino-Soviet Treaty differ greatly in wording. For example, the Chinese text stipulates that China and the Soviet Union each have half of the port facilities of Dalian, while the Russian text interprets it as the Soviet Union taking half first, leaving the remaining equipment to China. Among them, the boundaries of Lushun and Dalian and the methods of garrisoning Lushun have not been specified in detail. The situation of the Chinese Changchun Railway is also the same. Furthermore, the Soviet side has purchased a large amount of real estate in Dalian, which will also become a problem in the future.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 11th] There are still some problems with the Dalian issue. There is no definite date for a reply to the six conditions we have put forward to the Soviet side. The Soviet side claims that it can carry out political reception, but the obstacles have not been removed. However, preparations are still underway, and the preparations for reception by the units under the Resources Committee have been completed. It is reported that there are more than 1,000 factories in Greater Dalian.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] At the cocktail party welcoming Lee Seung-man, Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng said that it cannot be said that there are no Communist troops near Lushun and Dalian. With the strength of the National Army, it should not be a big problem to deal with the Communist troops. His words seemed to imply that in addition to military issues, this matter must also be resolved through diplomatic channels.

### National Funeral for Zhang Zizhong and Cai Yuanpei Approved by the Supreme National Defense Council at Its Regular Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] At the meeting of the National Defense Council on the 11th, the number of seats that representatives of various industries should occupy in the Legislative Yuan was discussed. It was decided to maintain the decision made by the National Defense Council at that time, with professional representatives occupying 119 seats (Note: The Legislative Yuan had changed it to 56 seats during the discussion), and the case was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. After Sun Ke returns to Nanjing, the case can be submitted for deliberation. Furthermore, the Federation of Vocational Groups sent representatives Tao Guilin and others to the National Defense Council on the 11th to petition. Liang Hancao received them.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Supreme National Defense Council held its 227th regular meeting in the National Government Conference Room at 9:00 AM today, chaired by member Yu Youren. More than 30 committee members attended. The following important cases were resolved: (1) The decision was made to grant Zhang Zizhong and Cai Yuanpei national funerals. Regarding requests for public funerals from various parties, it was decided to hand them over to the Executive Yuan for discretionary handling in accordance with the Public Funeral Regulations. (2) Chen Zhaoying, Inspector of Anhui and Jiangxi, and Guo Zhongkui, Inspector of Henan and Shandong, have reached the end of their terms and are to be reappointed. (3) Sun Jingya was appointed as a supervisory member of the Control Yuan. (4) The Executive Yuan submitted a police building plan to be implemented in coordination with the military reorganization plan and a pilot police officer system implementation plan for amendment and record. (5) The Executive Yuan submitted a request for clarification regarding the conflict between the Judicial Yuan's interpretation that people who concealed or purchased enemy and puppet materials from August 15, 1945, constitute the crime of stolen goods under criminal law, and the Yuan's regulation that October 1, 1945, is the date on which enemy property ceases to be transferred, and transfers after that date are invalid. It was decided to handle the case in accordance with the Judicial Yuan's interpretation. (6) The Executive Yuan's method for rewarding direct tax and commodity tax over-collection submitted by the Ministry of Finance was amended and approved.

### Change of Mayor of Lushun

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 11th] It is reported that there will be a change of mayor in Lushun. Sun Guiji has been appointed as the mayor by the Central Government. The order for the current mayor and county magistrate to be appointed as national senators will be issued soon.

### U.S. Troops Firing Practice in Tianjin
Five Children Injured and Killed by Unexploded Bombs

The candidates for the administrative committee members of the Democratic Socialist Party will be decided within a few days and then submitted together with the candidates for the government committee members. People from the party indicated that they do not intend to participate in the Executive Yuan's ministries for the time being. As for the rumors of a split in the party, the party spokesman Zheng Zhongwu solemnly denied them. He said that it is inevitable for a democratic party to have different opinions, and all rumors are inaccurate.

### Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Zhengding and Yuanshi, Situation in Shijiazhuang Remains Tense, Sun Lianzhong Returns to Baoding to Take Charge Within Days

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 11th] The flames of war are raging in Hebei Province. The Communist army has gathered more than 50,000 troops to launch a large-scale offensive, invading Shijiazhuang. The National Army in Gaocheng, east of Shijiazhuang, moved west yesterday afternoon. The two armies fought fiercely on the Gangshangfang all day yesterday. There are rumors that Luancheng has fallen. The railway between Shimen and Yuanshi has been destroyed, and Bao Ao Station has been under fierce attack. The fighting near the suburbs of Yuanshi is fierce. Frequent war reports are coming from Huolu, Jingxing, and Quanzhou on the Zhengtai Road. Last night at 11:00 PM, more than 1,000 Communist troops attacked Daguo Airport but failed and withdrew north. The battle for Zhengding has lasted for four days and nights. Strongholds within five miles of the city have continued to fall. The news that the Zhengding and Liuxinzhuang stations have fallen has not yet been confirmed. The Communist army is densely deployed along the 350-mile section between Baoding and Shijiazhuang, and Shijiazhuang is in an isolated state.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 11th] It is reported that the Communist forces in northern Shanxi, western Shandong, and southern Hebei continue to flee to Hebei and are gradually moving towards Shijiazhuang. Currently, the Communist forces in Lingshou, Pingshan, Wuji, Zanhuang, Ningjin, and Xingtang near Shimen are gathering. It is rumored that Nie Rongzhen has gone to Dingxian to command the operation. The Communist forces outside Baoding are also mobilizing frequently, and all parties are raising their vigilance. Sun Lianzhong will return to Baoding to take charge within days. Starting on the 11th, the National Army has been airlifting troops to Shijiazhuang. A major battle in Shijiazhuang is brewing.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 11th] The National Army that recovered Yongqing in the Tianjin-Baoding triangle area crossed the northern border of Baxian yesterday and arrived at Wen'an, approaching the Communist base town of Shengfang.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 11th] Amid the gradual strengthening of the National Army's strength in Cangxian, the railway authorities have also begun to transport a large amount of railway equipment to the area in preparation for repairs at any time.

### Two County Magistrates Killed in Action

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 11th] Shijiazhuang is still under fierce attack by the Communist army on the outskirts. The isolated Zhengding County is more critical than Shijiazhuang. According to people who flew from Shimen today, prices in Shijiazhuang have plummeted, and the market has been suspended. The staff of the Pinghan Railway have been completely evacuated to Shimen. Daguo Station on the Zhengtai Road fell the day before yesterday, and Huolu and Jingxing are in an isolated state. The airport in the western suburbs of Shijiazhuang was shelled by the Communist army on the night of the 10th, but it did not affect its use today. The air force is doing its best to transport ammunition and supplies and assist in the battle. The Shijiazhuang military authorities are determined to protect the city, so many small strongholds more than ten miles outside the city have been abandoned automatically. The south is guarded by Gaoqian, and the north is guarded by Liuxinzhuang. There are isolation trenches and earthen roads in the suburbs of the city, and there is a ring road that can be firmly defended. Officials today said that Luancheng is still being defended by the National Army. More than 1,000 government personnel and local troops from Xinle and Xingtang counties, who were evacuated to Zhengding after the fall of Dongchangshou earlier, were annihilated in this general offensive by the Communist army. Zhao Zilu, the county magistrate of Xingtang, Liu Qingtai, the county magistrate of Xinle, and the party secretaries of the two counties were all killed in action.

Shanxi Communist Army Probes for Offensive, Fierce Fighting in Quwo, Ronghe, and Youyu

[Central News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch, 11th] In order to save the remnant situation in northern Shaanxi, the Communist army in southern Shanxi has recently launched a probing offensive from the Taihang Mountain area, attempting to threaten Guanzhong. A total of 60,000 troops, including six brigades and five regiments of Chen Geng and Wang Yong's units, a unit of the New Fourth Army, a unit of the New Second Division, and local militia, are fleeing in all directions. A unit once fled to Dongyuchang on the east bank of the Yellow River and attempted to cross the river secretly. After days of interception by the National Army, they did not dare to attack lightly. Chen Geng's headquarters is still entrenched in Yicheng. Quwo and Ronghe counties in southern Shanxi are currently surrounded by the Communist army. There was fierce fighting in both places on the morning of the 11th.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch, 11th] After Chen Geng led more than 50,000 troops to invade Xinjiang and Jishan in southern Shanxi, they continued to attack westward.

After more than ten continuous fierce attacks, they did not succeed. At dawn, they detonated the explosives they had pre-buried before withdrawing from Youyu, causing the west city wall to collapse. More than 800 people broke into the city. The defending troops sealed off the gap with heavy machine guns and sent mobile units to fight in the streets. The remaining soldiers continued to fire calmly at the Communist army climbing the city. After three hours of fierce hand-to-hand combat, all the Communist troops in the inner city, except for 280 who surrendered, were left dead in the streets and alleys, with no survivors. It was not until 11:00 AM on the 9th that the Communist army fled towards Balibao and Weiyuanbao. After cleaning the battlefield, the Communist army left 500 corpses in the city, 500 corpses in the suburbs, and more than 400 wounded. The National Army also suffered heavy casualties, with one regimental commander injured. In addition, more than 800 light and heavy weapons were seized. The victory was brilliant. The comrades who defended Youyu were mostly the conscripts from Sui Province who were recruited last autumn.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch, 10th] It is reported that Xu Guangda, commander of the Yanmen Military Region, was injured in the battle of Youyu and has been sent to Linxian in northwestern Shanxi for treatment.

### Improving Civil Aviation Management: Ministry of Transportation Submits to the Political Council; Air Traffic Regulations to be Reviewed and Implemented

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Resident Committee of the Political Council previously appointed Jiang Yong, Yin Shuxian, and Zheng Kuiyi to go to Shanghai to investigate the plane crash. After drafting an investigation report and proposing many improvement suggestions, it was submitted to the government for handling. It is now learned that the Ministry of Transportation has submitted to the Political Council the handling of each point in the content of the investigation report. The Ministry's handling is recorded as follows:

(1) Regarding the prompt formulation of aviation regulations, unification of flight navigation command, and strengthening of aircrew management, the following is noted: 1. The Aviation Law has been promulgated, and the Air Traffic Regulations, personnel testing, and equipment inspection regulations are being drafted. Once the various measures are reviewed and finalized, they will be submitted for scheduled implementation. 2. The Ministry is starting to organize the existing navigation equipment of the China and Central Aviation Companies and instruct the Civil Aviation Administration to unify command. 3. Pilots, meteorological, and telecommunications personnel are currently being strictly screened by the Civil Aviation Administration. Those found to be technically deficient or of poor character will be eliminated at any time.

(2) Regarding the use of military airfields by civil aviation during peacetime, the Ministry has repeatedly consulted with the Air Force Commander-in-Chief, and a solution is expected in the short term.

(3) Regarding the increase of meteorological observation instruments, the addition of meteorological stations and observers, the Central Meteorological Bureau has been approved to be transferred to the Ministry. This year, the Ministry plans to actively construct various meteorological facilities on the important north-south and east-west air routes in the country, add various necessary equipment, and hire experienced technicians to enrich the resources, expanding to other secondary routes as financial resources allow.

(4) Regarding the modification of airfields and attention to adding and lengthening runways, the Ministry has established a Construction Engineering Office at Shanghai Longhua International Airport. The initial project is to reconstruct the runway to accommodate the landing of new-style giant aircraft. This project has already begun and is expected to be completed before the end of June this year. In addition, Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, Wuchang Xujiapeng Airport (i.e., Hankou Airport), and Jiujiang Shilipu Airport are also planned to be expanded this year in order to meet actual needs.

(5) Regarding the thorough cooperation and mutual assistance between the China and Central Aviation Companies to develop the civil aviation industry, the important navigation equipment of the two companies, such as radio stations, will be managed centrally by the Civil Aviation Administration for unified command. Before the Administration officially takes over, the radio stations of the two companies in various places will be ordered to open and be used jointly to facilitate navigation. As for airfield facilities, they will also be supervised to be used jointly within a possible range to enhance the purpose of mutual assistance and cooperation.

(6) Regarding strengthening the inspection of aircraft performance and the prohibition of using aircraft beyond their service life, the Ministry has stipulated the inspection time and service life of aircraft and engines to ensure flight safety.

(7) Regarding the suspension of flights in adverse weather conditions, the Ministry has considered the conditions in various places and raised the meteorological airworthiness standards, ordering compliance. From now on, aircraft on each route will suspend flights when the weather does not meet the prescribed standards to avoid accidents.

(8) Regarding the transportation and burial of deceased passengers, in the past, all deceased passengers in plane crashes, except those whose origin was too inconvenient to reach, have been transported back to their hometowns for burial. The transportation of the remains of passengers killed in this incident has been supervised by the two companies to handle properly, taking into account the circumstances.

(9) Regarding the rectification of the China Aviation Company and the severe punishment of personnel involved in previous accidents, the American director of the company's flight operations group has been replaced, and other personnel in various departments

(10) Regarding the revision of compensation for plane crashes, equal regulations should be made for compensation for all aircrew and passengers. Aviation passengers in the UK and the US have automatic insurance, and compensation can be made in case of accidents. In the past, in order to take into account the possibility of aircraft accidents and to provide compensation for the families of passengers, the Ministry formulated a "Provisional Measures for Compensation for Aircraft Accidents by Aviation Companies," stipulating that aviation companies should compensate for deaths, injuries, disappearances, or loss of luggage of passengers. However, this is a temporary measure for the transitional period. It is now planned to refer to the methods of the UK and the US and negotiate with insurance companies to create accidental insurance for air passengers. We are currently consulting with various insurance companies, and trial implementation will begin once the methods are agreed upon.

(11) Regarding the management of foreign civil aviation aircraft flying in our country's airspace by the Civil Aviation Administration, the Civil Aviation Administration has stationed personnel in international airports such as Shanghai and Guangzhou to be responsible for handling the entry and transit of foreign civil aviation aircraft. As for foreign aircraft entering and taking off at military airfields, the Ministry has always consulted with the Air Force Headquarters to handle the matter.

### US to Make New Proposal on Japanese Reparations; Reportedly China May Receive 45%; Two Key Headquarters Officials Have Arrived in Washington

[United Press, Washington, 10th] According to reliable sources from the Far Eastern Commission today: The new US proposal on Japanese reparations will stipulate that China and the United States should obtain 75% of all domestic Japanese materials available for reparations, of which the United States will take 30% and China will receive approximately 45%. The UK, Soviet Union, France, Australia, the Netherlands, India, the Philippines, New Zealand, and Canada will share the remaining 25%. The temporary reparations previously authorized and allocated by General MacArthur will be included in the aforementioned percentages.

The UK and the Soviet Union will object to the US allocation of too much to China, but US experts believe that China has fought Japan for a longer time among the Allied nations and has suffered the deepest Japanese devastation, so it should receive the most reparations. Unless there are completely unexpected obstacles, the United States will submit this new proposal to the Reparations Committee of the Far Eastern Commission on the 14th.

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Allied headquarters officials here today expressed surprise at the United Press report from Washington that the United States plans to submit the final Japanese reparations plan to the Far Eastern Commission on the 14th. However, they hope that the arrival of the two representatives from the Allied headquarters in Washington will speed up the resolution of Japanese reparations. They pointed out that the Allied headquarters did not send the director of the Economic and Scientific Section, Dangdai, and Ross to Washington, but Washington summoned Lei Luo and others back to Washington for consultation. US officials here said: Regarding the news that the final Japanese reparations plan will be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission next week, the recall of Lei Luo and others to Washington may be related to this development, but it is earlier than expected.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] The issue of Japanese reparations is now progressing toward a showdown, which is becoming increasingly clear today, as key officials handling reparations under MacArthur have arrived in Washington to discuss the policy with the authorities.

### Our Excellent Plan for the First Batch of Japanese Reparations Materials; Dismantling and Shipping to Begin in One or Two Months; Project Can Be Completed by Year-End

Yun Zhen Speaks

[This City News] Zi Yuan, the representative of the Resources Committee stationed in the United States, is scheduled to take a ship to the United States next Tuesday on official business. Zi Yuan was originally the chief representative of our government's five-member reparations team stationed in Japan. Recently, due to the heavy workload, he was unable to handle both positions and his resignation was approved. Yesterday, reporters visited to inquire about the situation of Japanese reparations to China. He reported that 15% of the total amount of Japanese reparations materials is allocated to China. The first batch of 400,000 tons is expected to begin dismantling and shipping within one or two months and is estimated to be transported by the end of this year. The transportation work is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation. The total freight and preparation costs from Japanese ports to Chinese ports are approximately 30 billion, and the rumored cost of several hundred billion includes construction costs. The largest part of the first batch of reparations materials is steel plants, followed by power plants and shipyards. In addition, there are tens of thousands of machine tools and tool factories. The handling of reparations materials is as follows: steel parts are allocated to Anshan and North China Steel Companies, shipbuilding parts are allocated to Shanghai Central Shipbuilding Company, power parts are allocated to Northeast Electric Power Bureau, Jibei Electric Power Company, Capital Power Plant, and power plants in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Changsha. Machine tool factories are moved to Ma'anshan and allocated to Xiangtan Central Electrical Factory. Machine tools are allocated to the Ministry of National Defense and urgently needed institutions such as national schools and coal mines. Private enterprises can also obtain a portion. Zi said that the government has detailed and perfect preparations for the transportation, allocation, construction, and required expenses of the first batch of reparations materials. The arrival of these materials will be of great benefit to the reconstruction of China's industry, but the power sector is still insufficient.

### Nantung's Efforts at Reconstruction

â€” Our Reporter Zhang Shengzhi

"Surging Yangtze River, majestic Zilang Mountain, numerous schools, and flourishing industry and commerce." This is a rough outline of Nantung's scenery.

Nantung enjoyed a great reputation in the past and was once praised as a model county, but it suffered eight years of devastation by the enemy and puppet regimes, resulting in a completely changed appearance and a state of near bankruptcy. Since the victory, although efforts have been made to revive it, it has ultimately been limited by manpower and material resources, making it difficult to restore its former glory in a short period.

Fifty Years of Arduous Management: A Model for Local Construction

Nantung's various undertakings, if compared separately with other places, do not seem to have anything special. The reason why it has won the name of a model county is that each construction project has an overall plan and a consistent spirit. Fifty years of arduous management coincide with today's national construction policies. For example, the current government's advocacy of increasing production, rural industrialization, cultivating technical talents, and training teachers all have concrete and micro-scale examples in Nantung. This is where its importance lies. It is worth recalling that Nantung gentry Zhang Jian (Jizhi) engaged in local construction fifty years ago, and his motivation was to save the country and survive. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, he strongly advocated enriching the country through industry and enlightening the people through education. At that time, his ideas were not widely accepted, so he resigned and returned to his hometown, seeking to establish a model in the locality. He first founded the Dasheng Yarn Factory. Two years later, with the profits from the yarn factory, he established Tongzhou Normal School, with attached departments of agriculture, engineering, surveying, and mapping. This was the predecessor of Nantung College. Furthermore, due to a shortage of textile raw materials, he reclaimed land along the coast of northern Jiangsu and promoted cotton planting. Around the tenth year of the Republic of China, various undertakings flourished, but due to the excessive scope and the inability of political and economic conditions to cooperate, it was burdened by debt and nearly came to a standstill. From an economic point of view, Nantung's undertakings had their failures at the time, but from the perspective of the entire country and society, it cannot be said that they were not quite successful. It contributed greatly to increasing production, cultivating teachers, and technical talents, and making significant contributions to the national economy and people's livelihood.

Education and Textiles Gradually Recovering; Salt Reclamation Still Stalled

Nantung's local undertakings can be divided into three major sectors: education, textiles, and salt reclamation. Other industries such as flour, oil, iron, transportation, warehousing, and charitable undertakings are closely linked to these three departments. During this visit of the reporter group to northern Jiangsu, they passed through Tongyi and met with Zhang Jingli, the general manager of Dasheng Yarn Factory, and visited all the business institutions. I deeply feel that northern Jiangsu has been in a state of war and chaos for the past ten years, and Nantung alone can be the first to recover. It still adheres to the consistent spirit of the past and carries out systematic and gradual reconstruction, which is truly rare and valuable. According to Zhang, at present, in Nantung, the work of education and textiles has been actively developed, but unfortunately, the salt reclamation area has not yet been fully established, and everything is still at a standstill, which has a profound and significant impact on the entire rural economy of northern Jiangsu. In short, all of Nantung's undertakings are a "complete set" of planned organization. Taking education as an example, the agricultural science department of Nantung College focused on cotton cultivation in the past, especially on cotton seed improvement to meet needs. This is different from the nature of general agricultural science departments. The textile department, in particular, is a special feature, as most of the textile technicians in the country today are derived from it. As for the medical department, it focuses on the training of rural doctors, so most of the graduates serve in the inland or the army. Tongzhou Normal School was completely destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War, with not a single tile left, but because the school is the mother of education in Tongyi, it was decided to restore it first. Recently, 800,000 yuan has been used as construction funds. When the reporter went to visit, the base had been completed and steel frames were being erected. It is expected to be completed in half a year, and enrollment can begin during the summer vacation. The Girls' Normal School has been gradually restored because it suffered less damage. According to statistics, the entire school now has five grades of high school normal classes, ten grades of junior high school, and 798 students.

Nantung Hospital was well-equipped before the war. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, it was ordered to move inland with the army, and all the equipment was destroyed. It has now applied to the government to hand over the enemy-remained Jiangbei Hospital to Nantung College as an affiliated hospital. At present, 90% of the medical work is to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. Because it is entirely voluntary, it has a significant impact on the hospital's reconstruction.

Regarding the Dasheng Textile Factory, it is divided into the first factory, the deputy factory, and the third factory, with a total of 140,000 spindles and 1,500 looms. Before the war, it produced 120,000 bales of yarn and more than one million bolts of cloth annually, using 500,000 dan of cotton. During the Anti-Japanese War, it suffered heavy losses, so the output decreased significantly after the victory. After efforts to restore it, the recent output has reached 80% of the pre-war level. According to the original plan, the entire northern Jiangsu area will have 500,000 spindles. If the environment is favorable in the future, it will not be difficult to gradually realize it. Moreover, farmers in Nantung have traditionally engaged in weaving as a side business. Before the war, sales to Northeast China, Sichuan, and other places reached more than 10 million bolts, but the products were all handmade wooden looms. Therefore, engineers are currently conducting investigations and research to assist farmers in improving them, reducing costs, and improving quality to enrich the rural economy. The next step in the plan is to link the three processes of textile bleaching, dyeing, and finishing into one, and prepare to establish a dyeing factory, which is expected to be completed next year, with a daily capacity of bleaching and dyeing 4,000 bolts of cloth.

The driving force of Nantung's industry is entirely supplied by the power plant in Tianshenggang, which currently has a power of 5,700 kilowatts. When the new machine arrives next year, it can be increased to 12,000 kilowatts. At the same time, there are plans to complete 30,000 kilowatts of power to supply the needs of Tongruhai.

In addition, northern Jiangsu also has a vast source of wealth, which is the salt reclamation area. The opening of salt reclamation in northern Jiangsu began in the 27th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty. At first, Zhang Qian founded the Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company in Lvsi Chang, Nantung. In the third year of the Republic of China, he founded the Dayou Jin Company, selecting higher silt beaches on the coast to build seawalls for planning and reclamation. After ten years of implementation, great results were achieved. The barren land of the past was transformed into an area with interconnected fields and houses facing each other. As a result, various salt reclamation companies were established one after another. From south to north, the area under their jurisdiction totaled more than 3 million mu, with about half of the land having been cultivated. Nearly 200,000 farmers directly depended on it for their livelihoods, and countless others indirectly benefited. The annual output of seed cotton was 2 million dan, with the improved cotton seeds of Dazhongji, Sanyu, and other towns being the most effective, making a significant contribution to textile raw materials. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the situation, the rural areas have been declining, and the work of restoration brooks no delay. It is generally believed that future development must achieve the following: (1) Ensure rural security, so that everything can be promoted in an orderly manner. (2) Provide emergency agricultural loans and request the Farmers Bank of China to provide low-interest loans to alleviate the difficulties of Jiangsu farmers. (3) Repair dikes, sluices, and rivers. (4) Open a new canal from Nantung to Lianshui, with a total length of 250 kilometers. Currently, if work is used as a substitute for relief, mobilizing 80,000 refugees to work will require 390,000 dan of wheat, which can be completed in four months. (5) Open 24 diversion rivers to guide water into the sea, and at the same time build dikes and gates to regulate the water volume.

Finally, according to Zhang Jingli, the above plan is based on 40 to 50 years of experience. I firmly believe that it is quite certain to build northern Jiangsu into a cotton textile industry center, because Nantung's construction already has a foundation.

### The Claim of Doubling the Repayment of Public Bonds Is Inaccurate; It Cannot Be Equated with Private Debt

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] A certain senior official of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance said: The claim of doubling the repayment of public bonds is purely speculation. From the standpoint of public debt management, the government should abide by the original rules and repay the principal and interest on schedule to maintain national credibility. As for doubling the repayment due to currency depreciation, this would not only increase the government's budget, but also be unfair to the holders of public bonds that have already been repaid, because it cannot be equated with private debt and bank deposits. Currently, the government has not yet repaid six or seven types of public bonds issued before the war, such as the Unified Public Bonds and Reconstruction Public Bonds, and more than ten items issued during the war, such as the National Defense Construction Public Bonds, all of which are being drawn and repaid on schedule in accordance with the regulations.

[Central News Agency, this city] Sun Xiangfeng, the president of the Wuxi People's Daily, specially attended the meeting of the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association yesterday, reporting on the destruction of the newspaper's office by students of the National Frontier College and requesting assistance.

Editorial

### Fire Prevention Is the Responsibility of the People

Life in an urban society requires safety and stability. But in today's Shanghai, the threat that citizens' lives and property and the materials and equipment of industry and commerce are most vulnerable to is the attack of fire. For the passive prevention of fire, the municipal administration has a fire administration department, with the task of preventing and extinguishing fires, thereby preserving the lives and property of citizens. Shanghai is known as a metropolis of the East, and is in fact the first city in China, with prosperous industry and commerce and a dense population; and the corruption of municipal administration, the inadequacy of construction, the fragmentation of fire administration, and the lack of moral concepts and sense of responsibility of the general public are also well-known. Now is the turn of spring and summer, and the climate will be hot in an instant. If we do not actively plan for fire prevention, then the lives and property of citizens can feel threatened at any time, which is indeed an important issue for Shanghai today.

Since the beginning of the year, Shanghai has experienced repeated fire alarms and frequent disasters. The great fire on Wuding Road lasted for thirteen hours, and the houses and properties of half a road, and the hard work of the victims for many years, were all reduced to ashes and difficult to recover. This disaster is a major test for fire administration. In theory, in the midst of public outcry, we should actively seek improvement and progress. Also, the pain of this disaster, in theory, the general public should have a cautious mentality to reduce or eliminate the causes of fire. However, according to statistics: in January this year, there were a total of 88 fire alarms in Shanghai; in February, it decreased to 113 times; in March, it increased to 154 times; from April 1st to 10th, it has reached 51 times; with an average of three fire alarms a day, and the disasters are unprecedented. Judging from the situation of fire alarms frequently reported in the past ten days, the number of fires this month may surpass the figures for March. Looking at the severity of the fire alarms and disasters each month, it is truly chilling and frightening, especially the great fire at the Maochang Warehouse on Nanxun Road on the 9th, which burned for nearly thirty hours or more. A large number of relief supplies from the Executive Yuan were burned to ashes, and the total amount of losses is no longer quantifiable; its disaster exceeded that of Wuding Road and has undoubtedly constituted an unprecedented major fire in Shanghai. The situation is so serious that it has only been seen in Shanghai in the past ten years. And the future is long, and fortune and misfortune are unpredictable. We must learn from the past and be cautious of the future, and we must issue an urgent call of "beware of fire" to the municipal authorities and the citizens.

"Beware of fire" is everyone's responsibility; it is not entirely the responsibility of the government, nor is it entirely the responsibility of the people. Therefore, the government must "beware of fire" in administrative measures: citizens must "beware of fire" in their lives and residences. In the past case of the great fire on Wuding Road, the public angrily criticized the corruption of firefighters, which had some reason, and most of the good firefighters felt ashamed of their reputation, but fortunately Mayor Wu was able to comfort them, and the firefighters became more vigilant and worked harder. In the past few months, fire alarms have been frequent, and firefighters in various districts have been rushing around. Under poor material conditions, they have shown even greater effort, and their spirit of service is truly admirable. Examining the causes of hundreds of fire alarms in recent months, especially the great fire at the Maochang Warehouse, half of the blame also lies in the lack of rigor in the daily lives of citizens and the negligence in the management of industrial and commercial institutions, resulting in continuous disasters. For this reason, today "beware of fire" is everyone's responsibility, and everyone must be vigilant and strive hard to make it effective.

The municipal authorities should seek the way to "beware of fire" in administrative measures, and should actively engage in fire prevention, focusing on the causes of fire alarms in recent days. First, since Shanghai has been through eight years of war, most of the electrical materials and equipment in public and private buildings are old, and electrical leakage occurs easily when they are wet, so electrical wiring inspections and safety inspections of electrical equipment in companies, firms, and homes should be carried out quickly. Second, the major cause of fires in recent days has been flammable liquids, some caused by cooking, some by storing flammable materials, especially the use of kerosene for cooking, which is more prone to fire than gasoline, and should be rationally restricted and banned. According to the statistics for March, of the 154 fires, Hongkou and Yangshupu accounted for 46, mostly caused by cooking with flammable liquids. For the sake of the lives and property of the general public, it is imperative to restrict and ban them. Third, Shanghai has a dense population, and most of them are not needed by the production sector. From the perspective of social and economic policy, we should seek to disperse the population to avoid the concentration of population in urban areas, and it is also necessary to restrict the influx of population. However, the most important thing at present is to ban mezzanines, relocate shantytowns, and stop all kinds of construction that is not conducive to fire protection. The above are just the general points. The general lack of efficiency in municipal administration, the Public Works Bureau, the Police Bureau, and the Fire Department are all related to direct and indirect fire protection. Passive fire protection, such as improving fire-fighting equipment, can strengthen the extinguishing of fires in tangible ways, but active fire protection, such as seeking perfection, can actively prevent fires in intangible ways. This is the way to "beware of fire" in administration.

The way for citizens to "beware of fire" is to first establish a moral concept in their minds, and to be cautious at all times and in all places in their actions. According to statistics in recent months, of the hundreds of fires, the most were caused by fires in homes, resulting in major disasters. Some were caused by cooking fires, some by using electric heating fires, some by chimney fires, and even some by worshipping gods and Buddhas, which shows that the lack of caution in family life is a major cause of fires. As for companies, firms, or institutions, they should strengthen management and improve efficiency: fire prevention equipment must be complete and kept in an applicable state at all times to avoid temporary failure. All fuels, chemical materials, and other equipment that are sufficient to ignite fire should be stored safely. The fire at the China Merchants Bureau's first wharf last month was rumored to have been caused by the ignition of stored "over-oxidized sodium," which shows that disasters can occur at any time if management is negligent.

According to reports yesterday, it has been discovered in this city that there is a "fire-setting team" organized by the Communist Party, using children in an attempt to cause disasters. The toxicity of their intentions is truly hateful. The security authorities of this city should pay close attention to such harmful acts at all times; that is, every citizen should also assist and strictly prevent them. We must not allow useful materials to be turned into ashes, and the lives and property of citizens to be damaged. Everyone must rise up and take responsibility for fire prevention!

### Britain and the United States Have Agreed to France's Request: The Saar Region Should Return to French Rule; However, They Oppose the Separation of the Ruhr Region from Germany; The Soviet Union Intends to Oppose China as a Convening Country for the German Peace Treaty

[United Press, Moscow, 10th] The United States and Britain today agreed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference to France's request to cede the 738-square-mile Saar region and its 863,000 inhabitants (mostly Germans) from Germany to France for separate rule. US Secretary of State Marshall also suggested that the Foreign Ministers' Conference take initial steps to implement this matter. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is scheduled to issue a statement tomorrow. As for France's request to separate the Ruhr industrial region from Germany, Marshall and British Foreign Minister Bevin both expressed their opposition. Marshall also opposed the establishment of a special administrative organization in the Ruhr and the international sharing or joint management of the region's industrial resources. France's request was made by Foreign Minister Bidault, who also requested that the Rhineland be allowed to be independent, but was rejected by Bevin. Bidault declared that ownership of the Ruhr's coal mines and smelters should be transferred to "countries that have attacked Germany," and that a special administrative organization for the Ruhr should be established under the "protection" of the UN Security Council, and that "considerable military force" should be permanently stationed in the Rhineland to prevent future German aggression. Molotov did not comment on this. Bevin said that the safest guarantee to prevent Germany was the Four-Power Pact proposed by the United States. Marshall then returned to the issue of revising the German-Polish border, hoping that the Allied countries would not adopt a border backed by force. It is said that this kind of border cannot serve as a good foundation for peace. At the same time, a spokesman for the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated that the current western border is final and cannot be changed.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 10th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference decided today to ask the Foreign Ministers' Conference to extend for two days to complete the report on the procedures for initiating the German peace treaty. According to this report, it was originally scheduled to be completed today.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] At the meeting of the four Deputy Foreign Ministers this morning, the Soviet representative opposed a proposal for China to be one of the convening countries of the German peace conference. On the contrary, Britain and the United States insisted that China should be one of the convening countries. At the same time, the date, location, and organization of the meeting should be immediately submitted to the Chinese government for approval.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] According to a hint by US Secretary of State Marshall two days ago, he will not leave Moscow before the end of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, nor will he ask for the conference to be extended. Secretary Marshall earnestly hopes that the agenda will be discussed completely, and he will not hesitate to re-examine the discussion of various issues in order to reach a final agreement.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] At the meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers this morning, British Foreign Minister Bevin agreed to the proposal that the German peace treaty should be signed by the German central government.

### Reaching an Agreement on the German Peace Treaty Is the Only Hope for Peace

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 10th] General Clay, the commander-in-chief of the US occupation forces in Germany, held a press conference today. German reporters were allowed to ask questions for the first time. When asked about the future of the German central government, General Clay said: The powers of the German central government must be strictly stipulated and must be subject to the powers of the states. Then the United States will agree to the establishment of a German central government. I still believe that the four powers may reach an agreement on the future of Germany, which is the only hope for peace. The German issue is the most difficult problem to solve after the war. Speaking of the recent coal mine strike in the Ruhr region, only the German people are affected by it. As for the recent statement by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, who vigorously stated that the reparations obtained by the Soviet Union were less than those of Britain and the United States, this statement is unreliable. Because the Soviet Union did not submit a report to the Allied Control Council for Germany, almost no one can know the exact amount of reparations obtained by the Soviet Union.

### British-Soviet Trade Negotiations About to Commence: Delegation Departs for Home

[British News Agency, London, 11th] The delegation from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which visited Britain as guests of the British Parliament, has completed its four-week visit and departed for home today.

### British-Soviet Trade Negotiations: About to Unfold in the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" carried this morning: British Foreign Minister Bevin's recent meeting with Soviet Marshal Stalin resulted in the British-Soviet trade negotiations about to unfold. The British delegation is scheduled to go to Moscow within the month.

### De Gaulle's Second Speech: French Cabinet Does Not Pay Attention to It

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] Regarding General de Gaulle's second speech, the major French political parties have adopted a firm stance, but the government has remained completely silent. According to Prime Minister Ramadier, De Gaulle's speech has not changed the views of the French cabinet in any way. The opinions he has recently expressed have not created a new situation that requires a cabinet meeting to discuss.

### Marshall Sends a Letter to Molotov: Condemning the Soviet Union's Policy Toward Korea: Advocating That the US-Soviet Joint Committee Should Be Reconvened Immediately

[United Press, Moscow, 11th] US Secretary of State Marshall today condemned the Soviet Union for creating serious economic difficulties in Korea and for causing the failure of the Allied policy in Korea. He proposed convening a conference between the United States and the Soviet Union this summer to review the Allied policy in Korea. Marshall sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, requesting that the two governments instruct the US and Soviet military commanders in Korea to immediately reconvene the US-Soviet Joint Committee, which has been suspended in Korea for a long time. He requested: According to the terms of the 1945 Moscow Agreement, "based on the democratic rights of respecting freedom of speech," the two of them are responsible for immediately resuming their work. Marshall also warned: The United States believes that there is no other way to follow besides this, and hopes that this step will be taken immediately in the US-occupied area of Korea without further delay, in order to promote the objectives stipulated in the Moscow Agreement and establish a temporary Korean government as a preliminary step towards Korean independence.

### U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan: Intense Debate Unfolds in the Security Council; Greek Representative Also Attends to Present Views

[United Press International, Lake Success, 10th] U.S. Representative Austin defended President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey. Austin denied Soviet Representative Gromyko's claim that the move interfered in Greek internal affairs, stating that Greece and Turkey had directly requested U.S. aid and that it was in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Austin requested that the Security Council postpone discussion of the situation in Turkey because the U.S. aid plan was still being debated in Congress, and the U.S. itself did not know what approach it would take.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th] The Greek representative to the United Nations, and current ambassador to the U.S., Dendramis, directly criticized neighboring countries to the north of Greece for attempting to fraudulently sell communist dictatorship to the Greek people while debating President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey today in the Security Council, and he supported the U.S.' request for the United Nations to endorse Truman's plan. Dendramis stated, "The reason Greece is constantly experiencing disputes is entirely due to the assistance given to a minority of Greeks from outside Greece's northern borders. These minorities intend to force Greece to adopt a communist dictatorship by coercive means." Earlier, Polish Representative Lange challenged U.S. Representative Austin, urging him to publicly declare within the United Nations organization whether the "totalitarian" threat that makes the Truman plan necessary is the Soviet Union. Austin ignored this, but Greek Representative Dendramis did not. Dendramis emphasized that the United States is the only country that can provide effective assistance to the suffering people of Greece and opposed the Soviet Union's proposal to organize a special committee of the Security Council to handle any matters related to aid to Greece.

### U.S. Has Signed Aviation Rights Agreements with Fifteen Countries; Most Involve Surplus Goods as Exchange Conditions

[United States Information Service, Washington, 10th] The Foreign Liquidation Commission announced today that the U.S. has completed aviation rights agreements with fifteen countries. These agreements include the disposition of surplus goods overseas. As a result, U.S. airlines now have the right to fly on routes within these countries, use navigation equipment, communication tools, weather reports, and airport facilities around the world. Most of the aid shipped by the U.S. to other countries consists of surplus goods, which, in most cases, serve as exchange conditions for the U.S. to obtain flying rights. Some air stations are currently managed by U.S. airline personnel, who are also training technicians locally for application. It is understood that these agreements include China.

### U.S. Telephone Labor Strike: No Hope for Resolution in Sight

New Jersey Workers Refuse to Return to Work

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] U.S. telephone industry strike leaders rejected the compromise solution proposed by management to the main long-distance telephone union, dimming hopes tonight for a quick resolution to the four-day-old nationwide telephone strike. Communications Workers of America President Beirne stated that the company's proposal was unsatisfactory, but he would keep the door open for continued negotiations.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] New Jersey Governor Driscoll issued an order yesterday prohibiting the strike, stating that telephone workers would be fined or imprisoned if they did not return to work by 4 p.m. today. The executive committee of the U.S. telephone union ordered telephone workers in the state to refuse to return to work, denouncing the order as not only unconstitutional but also fascist.

### U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan Unanimously Passed by Senate; Vandenberg Amendment

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] The Senate today unanimously passed the amendment proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, clearing the first major obstacle for President Truman's proposal to provide $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey. According to the amendment, if a majority of the Security Council (where the veto power does not apply) or a majority of the General Assembly believes that aid to Greece and Turkey is unnecessary or should no longer be provided, the United Nations has the right to halt U.S. aid efforts at any time. President Truman also has the right to stop aid efforts at will or at the direct request of Greece or Turkey. The Senate also unanimously passed another amendment requiring that the administrator of the plan appointed by Truman be subject to the approval of the House of Representatives, and that U.S. funds not be used to repay Greek or Turkish foreign debt. The Senate's sudden acceleration of action today was due to Republican Senator Taft's first full support for Truman's plan to contain communism in the Middle East. Democratic Senator Connally strongly denounced the Soviet Union as an aggressor, while Democratic Senator Pepper argued that the U.S. was abandoning the policies of the late President Roosevelt and engaging in an "undeclared war" against the Soviet Union. While the two were engaged in a heated debate, Taft stated that he would vote in favor of President Truman's plan, as otherwise, "We will be seen by the Soviet Union as the end of American prestige." Taft also stated that he did not believe the plan set a precedent for similar aid to other countries. Observers believe that the unanimous passage of the Vandenberg amendment can be interpreted as an indication that the entire aid plan will also receive overwhelming support when it is put to a final vote at the end of this week or the beginning of next week.

### President Truman to Broadcast Commemoration of President Roosevelt Today

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] President Truman is scheduled to fly to Grandview, Missouri, on the morning of the 12th to visit his 94-year-old mother, and then travel to Kansas City to deliver a speech in a broadcast program commemorating President Roosevelt.

The second part includes sanctions and the veto power. Soviet Representative Gromyko objected beforehand. Gromyko said that the subcommittee should first discuss the issue of concluding an international convention banning atomic weapons, and it was surprising that the U.S. work plan did not mention this point. No discussion can be fruitful without starting from this point.

### Draft Housing Lease Regulations: Preliminary Amendments Made by the Senate; Drafted Yesterday in a Joint Meeting of Three Committees; Will Be Sent to the Legislative Yuan After Soliciting Opinions from All Senators

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the victory of the War of Resistance, housing lease disputes in this city have never ceased, and both landlords and tenants have been troubled by this issue. Recently, the Economic, Land Law, and Civil Law committees of the Legislative Yuan were ordered to complete the draft of the Housing Lease Regulations and submitted it to the municipal government for endorsement. The municipal government then sent the case to the Municipal Senate for discussion. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the council specially convened a joint meeting of the Land Administration, Regulations, and Social Affairs committees, and representatives from the Land Administration and Social Affairs Bureaus were invited to attend. Approximately 30 people attended, chaired by Wu Zhengzhuan. After about three hours of discussion, the draft regulations were revised again. It was also decided to distribute this revised draft to all senators within the week to solicit opinions and then send it to the Legislative Yuan for reference and deliberation.

### The Draft Housing Lease Regulations, as Preliminarily Amended Yesterday by the Joint Meeting of the Municipal Senate, are as follows:

Article 1: These regulations shall apply to housing lessors in the capital cities of provinces and municipalities and other densely populated areas where renting is difficult, as designated by the provincial government. Matters not stipulated in these regulations shall be governed by the Civil Code, the Land Law, and other laws and regulations. (Original text)

Article 2: In the areas mentioned in the previous article, the governments of the respective jurisdictions should, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law regarding the preparation of housing, build residential housing for the people and encourage the people to build residential housing. (Original text)

Surplus Housing Must Be Leased

Article 3: (1) If housing suitable for residence is currently not for personal use and has not been leased, the government in charge may order it to be leased within a period of one month.

(2) Provisions that violate the preceding paragraph and are unfavorable to the lessee shall be invalid. (New addition)

There is also a temporary motion regarding the standard for housing rent, which was not concluded due to time constraints. It was then resolved that the secretariat of the Senate shall notify the members of the three committees to divide the housing in the four districts of the city, east, west, north, and south, into three grades, A, B, and C, and examine their pre-war and current rents for reference.

### "Termination of Lease Upon Expiration" Conflicts with Resolution of the General Assembly

Senator Zhang Expresses Opinion

Yesterday, a reporter inquired about Municipal Senator Zhang Yiqu's opinion on the Legislative Yuan's draft Housing Lease Regulations. According to him: Recently, the housing shortage in this city has become increasingly serious. The Housing Lease Regulations should be drafted more meticulously. I once proposed at the first general assembly of the Municipal Senate that the original lessee should have the right to continue leasing, which was passed by the general assembly. Upon checking the Legislative Yuan's draft Housing Lease Regulations, Article 9 (now Article 10 as revised by the Senate) stipulates that "if the agreed lease term has expired," the lessor may terminate the contract, which completely contradicts the general assembly's resolution that "the original lessee has the right to continue leasing." Article 9 (now Article 10 as revised by the Senate), Paragraph 6, of the draft should be revised to read "if the agreed lease term has expired and the original lessee does not need to renew the lease" to be appropriate. Otherwise, the lessee will never have a day of peaceful and happy life. Because the agreed lease term for housing in this city recently is generally one year, and as short as six months or three months. If the contract must be terminated upon the expiration of the agreed lease term and not renewed, then the entire city of Shanghai will be in turmoil all day long, which is bound to cause a catastrophic universal dispute, the danger of which is extremely great, and so on.

### Huge Corruption Case of Theft and Sale at the United Logistics Department Clothing Factory; Attempt to Bribe 500 Million Yuan to Erase Traces; All Perpetrators Have Been Detained; Three Absconding Merchants Have Been Arrested

It is reported that several important personnel in a certain clothing factory established in Shanghai by the Production Department of the Logistics Department of the United Logistics Headquarters are suspected of continuously stealing and selling large amounts of cloth and replacing better-quality cloth with inferior cloth. After being reported to the Ministry of National Defense, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng secretly dispatched a major general from the Supervisory Bureau to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the matter. Due to the serious nature of the case, concrete results were only obtained recently. It is heard that the personnel of the clothing factory once attempted to bribe the personnel in charge of the case with 500 million yuan to erase traces, but were rejected. They then attempted to bribe the major general alone with 20 million yuan. The major general believed that the bribery was sufficient evidence of the corruption case and, after confirmation by a third party, accepted the first batch of 5 million yuan, with the remainder promised to be paid in installments. As the case developed to the stage of action, Peng Weiren, Director of the Supervisory Bureau, and Zhang Xian, Director of the Military Law Department, personally came to Shanghai to execute the operation. After consulting with relevant parties in the city, all the perpetrators of the clothing factory's corruption were detained, and three merchants suspected of colluding with the clothing factory in corruption were arrested the day before yesterday. However, it is learned that the mastermind of the case has fled upon hearing the news and will continue to be arrested and brought to justice. It is heard that the perpetrators will be transferred to Beijing for interrogation by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense.

### Rotary Branch Holds Annual Meeting; No Less Important Than the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference; Mayor Hopes to Promote the Spirit of Benefiting Others and Oneself

### Tongji Students Petition Again; Port Headquarters to Respond Today

[Reported by this newspaper] The strike at Tongji University remained deadlocked yesterday. Yesterday, the student union of the school told reporters during a reception at the Faculty of Arts that all students expressed indignation at the open letter published by Company Commander Wang in various newspapers the other day. In particular, they believed that the two points mentioned in the letter, that students beat soldiers and that no students were injured, deliberately distorted the facts and reversed right and wrong.

Representatives of the student union of the school continued to petition the garrison headquarters and the port headquarters yesterday morning. Commander Xuan of the garrison headquarters personally received them. Commander Xuan first clarified that the powers of the garrison headquarters and the port headquarters are parallel, so he only wished to express his opinion as an intermediary, stating that he hoped that Tongji students would not confuse the beating of students by soldiers and the withdrawal of troops from the campus, because the stationing of troops was by order of the state, so the withdrawal must also await the order of the state. Regarding the beating of students by soldiers, the port commander has already made an oral apology and guarantee to the president of the school, so he sincerely hoped that the students could resume classes as soon as possible. When the student representatives went to the port headquarters to petition, Director Qiu of the adjutant's office represented the headquarters in receiving them. He was unable to respond to the four demands raised by the students, but he believed that the headquarters might accept them, and he said that the port headquarters would give a formal reply to the school tomorrow (i.e., today) morning. Currently, all students at Tongji University are quietly observing the content of the reply. According to them, if the reply is not satisfactory, they will continue the strike and expand the action.

### Mayor Invites Industry Leaders to Discuss Curbing Price Hikes: Central Government Has Determination to Stabilize Prices; Believes Orders Will Arrive Soon

[Our Report] This city and Nanjing have been designated by the central government as areas for strict price control. The authorities unanimously believe that Shanghai and Nanjing have a leading role in the national finance and prices, and they must fully stabilize price increases. After Mayor Wu returned from a price conference in Nanjing yesterday, he convened leaders of the local cotton yarn, rice, flour, edible oil, and other industries in the municipal government conference room at 4 PM to discuss practical ways to suppress prices. Shen Bo-le of the yarn industry, Dong Jiu-feng of the cotton cloth industry, Xing Zhi-gang and Gu Yi-sheng of the bean and rice industry, Pan Shi-hao of the dyeing and weaving industry, Qiu Liang-rong of the oil pressing industry, and Wang Yang-ta of the China Edible Oil Company attended. Mayor Wu reported that the central government has prepared concrete measures to stabilize the prices of four major daily necessities: cotton yarn, rice, edible oil, and flour. He believes that orders will arrive here in about a week. Before the official negotiated prices are announced, the following measures to curb price increases during the transitional period were discussed:

Yarn Factories Should Not Rush to Buy Cotton

(1) Cotton Yarn - The mayor said: The price of yarn depends on the price of cotton. If the price of cotton is stable, there is no reason for the price of yarn to rise. Before the new cotton comes on the market this year, the government will have appropriate measures. Factories should not rush to buy. Also, cotton yarn merchants' sales transactions must be registered in accordance with the regulations set by the Cotton Management Committee, otherwise the economic supervision team will arrest them.

Government to Dump Foreign Rice

(2) Rice - In order to quickly suppress the price of rice, the foreign rice controlled by the government will be dumped. The method of dumping will be discussed and decided after Vice Minister of Food Pang Song-zhou arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing tonight. According to Mayor Wu, there will be no panic in the rice supply in the Shanghai and Nanjing area. Regarding the large-scale purchase of rice from rice-producing areas, which has led to rising rice prices, the provincial government has sent personnel to Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places to investigate secretly. In addition, Mayor Wu said that he "cannot recognize, but will not interfere with" the decision of the municipal price evaluation committee that the price of white japonica rice should not exceed 140,000 per stone. He hopes that rice merchants can cooperate sincerely with the government. After Vice Minister Pang arrives in Shanghai, rice merchant representatives will be convened again to discuss good strategies.

Oil Price Negotiated at 350,000

(3) Edible Oil - Yesterday, the market price of edible oil was 400,000 yuan per dan. Mayor Wu believes that the price is too high and unreasonable. The representatives of the oil pressing industry and vegetable oil factories who attended the meeting yesterday also admitted that the price was too high and unanimously decided that it should not exceed 350,000 yuan from today. If there are black market transactions, the municipal government will strictly crack down on them. Mayor Wu said: I can only recognize this price of 350,000 as a temporary market price during the transitional period. The negotiated price that the central government may announce in a week may be lower than this number. Before the order arrives, 350,000 will be the highest price for the time being.

Flour to Maintain Original Price

(4) Flour - The Mayor said: So far, there seems to be no problem with flour, and it has been decided to maintain the original price. However, there should be close attention to any resale.

Dapu Road

The flames spread in an instant. The driver of the truck, Li A-da, and the worker saw that they had caused trouble and abandoned the truck and fled, causing the fire to quickly spread to No. 57 Dapu Road and continue to spread, causing a major disaster.

### Reader Consultation Medical and Health

Wang Xianyi asks: When I was thirteen years old, I suffered from a foot ailment, with soreness in both knees that prevented me from moving. After applying safflower oil, I felt slightly better. In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), I suffered from typhoid fever, and walking became even more difficult. Whenever the weather turns cold, the soreness intensifies, making it impossible to take even a single step. I would like to ask: (1) What is this illness, and how can it be treated? (2) Why is there stinging pain in my urethra when urinating, and why is the urine cloudy?

[Answer by Medical Doctor Tang Renjin] (1) A diagnosis should be determined before treatment can be administered. Recovery may be possible. (2) It is undoubtedly urethritis. A urine test must be conducted first to determine the treatment plan.

(2) Chest Pain

Wang Xinhua asks: I have had a cough for more than half a year, suspected to be a lung ailment. Three months ago, I had an X-ray, which showed no lung disease, but the cough has not gone away.

My appetite is still good, and my spirits are also fine. I would like to ask, what is the exact ailment? What treatment methods are available? Is there any specific medicine? Is the chest pain a sign of lung disease? Is taking cod liver oil effective?

[Answer by Medical Doctor Tang Renjin] Your ailment is likely chronic bronchitis. Besides treating the symptoms, there is no special therapy or specific medicine.

### The UNESCO Will Hold the First Conference on Basic Education in China, Indicating China's Leading Position

[Central News Agency, London Airmail] The Standing Committee of the Executive Board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), at its recent meeting held in Paris in February 1947, designated "basic education" as one of the three major programs for 1947. As for what is basic education, a spokesperson for the organization said that the term is actually a new term, which not only wants to include the concept of children's education, but also wants to include adult education. They want to show that this kind of education is not only to enable people to read, write, and calculate, but also to give them basic education, so that they can make a living and improve their economic situation, be able to express themselves, improve their health environment, be able to participate in their domestic and international government, and be able to obtain a more complete and better life. However, there is currently no word that can encompass the above purposes, so this new term was created.

Having a Leadership Role

The spokesperson said: "Several countries have successful programs in promoting basic education. The Soviet Union, Mexico, Turkey, and China are the most successful. China, encouraged by Sun Deliyi in 1911 and continuously promoted by Chairman Chiang, has continued to develop the large-scale education experience even during the War of Resistance Against Japan. This feat will forever be a glorious history of education and an epic in education." UNESCO, in view of China's leading position in the fight against illiteracy, has decided to hold its first "Regional Study Conference" in Nanjing from June 2 to 14 (Editor's note: A telegram was recently received from Beijing saying that it has been postponed to July 1). Experts from Asian and South Pacific countries and territories will attend the conference. UNESCO Director-General Julian Huxley said in a letter to our Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua on March 12: Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and Your Excellency, your country has achieved remarkable work results in basic education. Therefore, we believe that it is most appropriate for UNESCO to hold the first conference on this issue in your country. I believe that in convening this conference, China has a leading role in the most important aspects. This leadership is in line with its great tradition and its current and future position in the world.

Four Major Issues

It is reported that the Nanjing Conference will focus on the following four major issues: (1) The language problem of basic education, (2) Reading material problems, (3) The use of new technologies in literacy training, (4) Administrative and organizational aspects, including finance and personnel. In addition, UNESCO has decided to cooperate with the governments of two member states to conduct "guidance programs" in China and Haiti. UNESCO hopes that the three regional conferences to be held in Nanjing in the future will be able to develop special guidance programs that will be carried out in 1947. The results will be of the greatest value to China's basic education program. The guidance program to be carried out in China will include the following four themes: (1) Using tools that help understanding to educate illiterate adults and adolescents, (2) Using visual media to educate illiterate adults, (3) Developing simple teaching materials for educating illiterate adults on health education, economic development, and cultural development, and simple teaching materials for promoting international understanding, (4) Actively training the implementers of basic education. After the Nanjing Conference, another similar regional conference will be held in Mexico City in November, with experts from China, the United States, and South American countries participating.

The Sino-Foreign Exchange Limit Remains Restricted; National Banks May Approve Increases in Special Circumstances
The Central Trust of China Bank previously imposed strict restrictions on the amount of Sino-Foreign exchange to prevent speculative hot money from concentrating in Shanghai and affecting the financial market. Commercial banks and firms in various regions were divided into three categories with weekly exchange limits of 50 million, 40 million, and 30 million. These commercial banks and firms felt that these limits were too strict and hindered business development, and hoped that the Central Bank would relax them. It is reported that the Central Bank has considered this issue and believes that the current financial markets in various regions are very normal and that the existing quotas are sufficient to meet needs, so it has decided not to change them. However, if banks or firms have special circumstances, they can state their reasons and apply for a reasonable increase.

### Hardware Market Soars in Unison
[Our Newspaper Report] The long-sluggish hardware market saw prices rise across the board yesterday. The overseas prices of some imported hardware have reportedly increased, sparking a buying spree. Three-Star saw blades were priced at 154,000 yuan per gross, and 1/2 inch foreign coins were priced at 235,000 yuan per dan. Other items such as foreign nails, files, and high-speed steel also followed suit.

Cotton Yarn: Tianjin Merchants Show Interest
The cotton yarn market saw interest only from Tianjin merchants, with slightly more inventory appearing on the market, causing asking prices to fall. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was once quoted as high as 8.9 million yuan, but due to sluggish sales, the price was lowered to 8.85 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 4.9 million yuan, an increase of 100,000 yuan, while 16-count yarn saw an increase of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.

Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn
Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company sold various counts of cotton yarn as usual. 42-count Cat Butterfly yarn was priced at 7.15 million, 20-count Water Moon at 3.6 million yuan, 16-count Airplane Grass Bag at 3.2 million yuan, 32-count Abundant Harvest at 6.8 million, and 60-count Five Sons at 10.5 million yuan. A total of 2,118 pieces were sold, including 1,734 to domestic manufacturers and 384 to yarn dealers. Applications were received from a total of 1,217 entities, including 833 domestic manufacturers and 384 yarn dealers.

National Bank Prioritizes Foreign Exchange for Purchasing Foreign Rice
According to Yu Ruxin, the assistant manager of the Procurement Department of the Central Trust of China, based on the limits set by the Washington International Food Council, China can purchase 200,000 tons of foreign rice in the first half of this year. The Central Trust of China is actively procuring and transporting this rice to increase domestic food reserves. In addition, 60,000 tons of Siamese and Burmese rice will be loaded onto ships at the end of this month and are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of May. The cost of foreign rice, including freight, is approximately 130,000 yuan for Burmese and Thai rice, while Annamese rice is priced at 180,000 yuan due to intentional obstruction by the French. In the future, if it is sold on the market, it will be sold at a price lower than the cost. The policy will be decided by the Executive Yuan, and the National Bank has agreed to prioritize foreign exchange for the purchase of foreign rice.

Seasonal Quotas for Kerosene and Tobacco Imports Modified
[Our Newspaper Report] The Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee held its 28th regular meeting on the 10th. In addition to the two cases that were announced yesterday, the following items were also approved:
(1) Regarding the seasonal quotas for kerosene and tobacco in Appendix (II), the original quota for the first quarter was set for February to April. Due to actual needs, the predetermined quotas for kerosene and tobacco for the first quarter have been changed to January to March. The quota for the second quarter is designated as April to June and will be determined separately when the second-quarter quota is established.
(2) When importing machinery, importers often need to import accessories. These accessories sometimes fall within Appendix (II), but the importer is not a registered importer for Appendix (II) goods, which prevents the requested accessories from being imported, rendering the main machinery ineffective. To ensure that machinery and accessories can be imported together, the committee has decided to establish a review committee for industrial machinery accessories, appointing Wu Yunchu, Yang Xiren, Li Qijun, and You Yinzhao as members, with Wu Yunchu as the convener.

In summary, at the beginning of the surrender, the types and tonnage of ships remaining in the Japanese army were approximately as follows:
(1) A total of 159 naval vessels, with a total tonnage of over 388,000 tons. Except for a portion that was blown up by the U.S. military, 131 of them (approximately 100,000 total tons) were transferred for use in repatriation and transportation.
(2) The "Nagato" and "Sake" battleships were used for atomic bomb testing at Bikini Atoll.
(3) Vessels that have already been destroyed by the U.S. military include: 3 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, 5 cruisers, 1 destroyer, 50 submarines, 3 training ships, 2 target ships, and 6 minelayers, coastal defense ships, minesweepers, and submarine chasers.
(4) Currently unprocessed: 10 cruisers, 23 coastal defense ships, 24 submarine chasers, 13 patrol boats, 1 target ship, 2 transport ships, 3 minesweepers, and 6 number boats.
(5) Vessels that were still under construction and had not been completed before the surrender: a total of 104 vessels with a total displacement of 123,000 tons. Aircraft carriers (4 ships), coastal defense ships (2 ships), and submarines (34 ships) were completely dismantled. Destroyers (4 ships), coastal defense ships (18 ships), patrol boats (22 ships), transport ships (5 ships), minesweepers (1 ship), and target boats (1 ship) were converted into merchant ships. The total amount of scrap iron dismantled was 158,000 tons. Once the repatriation work is completed, all ships are expected to be dismantled within the year.
At the time of surrender, the Japanese army overseas, from Kuye Island in the north to the islands of the Dutch New Guinea in the south, including Japanese residents, totaled over 7,076,000. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of the Navy in September 1945, the army had 3,197,000 personnel, the navy had 455,000 personnel, and the total number of overseas residents was 3,422,000. According to a report from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the total number of overseas prisoners of war at that time was only 6,374,000. It is generally estimated that the total figures made by the former are more reliable. (See the table below)
Number of Japanese POWs and Overseas Residents in Various Regions Before Japan's Surrender (Statistics from the Ministry of the Navy, September 25, 1945)
The numbers of Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents were so large that surrender was not easy, and the work of repatriation and demobilization was even more arduous. Based on the content of the Potsdam Declaration, the Allied Headquarters established a repatriation team to smoothly handle the above-mentioned Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents and began the repatriation work. Transportation was handled by a new agency called SCAJAP. The means of transportation used by this agency were Japanese ships received by the United States and surplus ships from the United States itself. The crew was staffed by Japanese personnel, and the cost was borne by the Japanese government. All supervisory powers were in the hands of the United States. At the beginning of the surrender, the Japanese government had only 260,000 tons of merchant ships, and it was expected that the repatriation work would not be completed until May 1950. Later, because it was felt that there were not enough ships and the transportation work was too slow, the U.S. military allocated 105 Liberty ships (total tonnage of 350,000 tons) and 85 landing craft (total tonnage of 102,000 tons) in March 1945, plus 43 Japanese ships (total tonnage of 83,000 tons) and 131 Japanese naval warships (total tonnage of 108,000 tons), which greatly increased the transportation capacity and was of great help in promoting the demobilization of the Japanese army.
The procedures for repatriating Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents are worth mentioning. The first step is to detain all Japanese soldiers and overseas residents from the surrendered country into concentration camps; then, they are escorted from the concentration camps to the port or wharf; next, they must undergo customs inspection to prevent smuggling of materials or weapons, and they must undergo disease inspection and be vaccinated before being allowed to board the ship; the fourth step is implemented on the ship: ask each soldier or overseas resident for their name, address, unit number, and the current situation of soldiers in the same unit, and inquire about the payment of military salaries; the fifth step is: after returning to Japan, the reception station will distribute clothing, give return train tickets or boat tickets, provide two days of food and small expenses for the journey (300 Japanese yen), and notify local relief agencies to distribute their unpaid military salaries.
The repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents proceeded smoothly, with an average of about 186,000 people being repatriated per week. By the end of last year, it was generally completed. As for those who were selectively retained in China, they were only technical personnel to meet the needs of the takeover work and current business, and their repatriation work will be considered when the time is right.
The work of repatriating Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents by the Soviet Union in Northeast China, North Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands has always been very slow. Since March of last year, a portion of Northeast China has been taken over by our army, and the first batch of repatriations began on May 13. By the end of May, a total of 63,500 people had been repatriated. As of early June, the number of Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents remaining in Northeast China was still as high as 1.9 million, including 1.6 million Japanese residents and 300,000 Japanese prisoners of war. The areas where they remained and their numbers are as follows: 500,000 in northern Manchuria, 400,000 in the Shenyang-Huludao area, 64,000 in the Shenyang-Dalian area, 269,000 in the Dalian city area, and 80,000 in the Andong city area, totaling 1,399,000. The whereabouts of another 500,000 people are still unknown. Of the 200,000 Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents originally in North Korea, some have successively fled to South Korea due to various reasons, and then repatriated to their home country by the U.S. military. It is said that there are still 14,000 Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents in the Kuril Islands and 300,000 people in Sakhalin Island. There are still 1.2 million Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents remaining in the Soviet-occupied areas who have not been repatriated. On December 19 of last year, the Allied Headquarters and the Soviet Army reached an agreement that the Soviet Army would repatriate 50,000 people per month. As for the 90,000 Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents remaining in the Dutch East Indies and British colonies (such as Malaya), the Allied Headquarters reported that they have been unable to repatriate them to this day purely due to ship issues.
One more thing worth mentioning is that the 1.2 million Allied residents who resided in Japan before the war have all successively boarded empty ships that repatriated Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents and returned to their respective countries. In addition, there are currently over a thousand nationals and civilians of enemy countries and traitors (including those with German, British, American, Dutch, and Canadian citizenship) detained in Japan, who are being dealt with separately.

To Mayor Wu Guozhen of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Honorable Members of the Liang Renda Funeral Committee:
With utmost respect, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the enthusiasm and generous donations of condolence money to the family members of my late brother, Renda, who was tragically murdered on February 9th, which has touched us deeply and brought some comfort to his soul. As Renda's elder brother, I would like to offer some humble suggestions regarding the future use of the donated funds, for your consideration and guidance. I would be most grateful. (The detailed plan is too long and has been sent to the Municipal Government separately, so it is omitted here.)
Sincerely, Liang Renpu from Hong Kong.

Literary Profiles of Chengdu in the Spring and Autumn Period Luo Yujun
A clear spring day is a rare sight in Chengdu. The chilling east wind, with its power to make people shiver and shrink, is no less fierce than the north wind. But spring has indeed arrived. Don't you believe it? The heat under the blanket at midnight, the clever chirping of birds on the branches at dawn, the gradually reviving flowers and plants in the courtyardâ€”are these not signs of spring?
On February 2nd, we woke up early and hurriedly tidied ourselves because of the precious friendship that bound us together. None of us could forget Li Jieren, the host of Lingke, who had invited us for the day. We all came prepared with a sincere heart to listen to the sharp and insightful discussions and with a healthy appetite to enjoy the renowned delicacies.
At eleven o'clock, the car passed the Niushikou station, and beyond that was the eastward Yangguan Avenue. It's hard to believe, but after living in this ancient city for ten years, today is the first time I've been to the East Station. The dilapidated mud houses around the station, leaning precariously and unable to withstand the wind and rain, along with the station's own state of decay, truly shocked me. The poverty of the Chinese people is something that people in England and America cannot imagine. This vast and sorrowful nation can adapt and survive under any harsh and impoverished conditions. Who gives us this great power to survive? Only nature can understand.
The car stopped in the square of Shangshahe Fort. I was not allowed to continue staring blankly at the distant sky and the newly green wheat fields. The four of us got out of the car and headed towards the road to Lingjiao Yan. Xiaofang insisted on asking for directions as we walked, while Chen Xianghe firmly believed in his experience and memory and refused to ask anyone. Xianghe and Lin Ruji even had a heated argument. Fortunately, this is a democratic era, and everyone respected each other's opinions. Soon, we reached a fork in the road, and Ruji firmly stated that we should turn left. Because the road to the right led to a large orchard five miles away, where his youth and laughter were buried, and the road was imprinted with his sorrowful footsteps. After this sincere explanation, Xianghe's confidence wavered, and we all agreed to ask the farmers by the roadside to verify Ruji's judgment. The farmer replied very sincerely:
"Are you asking about Professor Li? The one who writes about Ba Jin? He lives in the orchard on the slope."
In order to divert Ruji's sad memories, I suddenly exclaimed: "What beautiful red soil! The red soil on the Yue Wang Temple path in West Lake cannot be so proud!" Xianghe also chimed in, saying: "This soil is most suitable for growing jasmine flowers." I said: "The fragrance of jasmine, gardenia, and ylang-ylang is too strong and vulgar. Only the fragrance of orchids is elegant." As soon as I said this, I suddenly remembered that Ruji's late wife was named Shuman, and I feared that the word "orchid" would lead to associations with "Cymbidium," and I felt a little embarrassed. Fortunately, the other group of guests arrived, diverting Ruji's attention. LÃ¼ Chaoxiang said: "Once, I heard Li Jieren's voice as soon as I got here." He inadvertently revealed his pen name, which meant "voice like a loud bell."
Lingke is not bordered by the bustling world, but it has a quiet wooden gate. On the horizontal beam is written "Better to Give Than to Receive." The couplet beside the door reads, "Through tribulations, the vast sea is easily overturned; in the depths of spring, the peach blossoms are hard to thank." They are all written on bright red paper, which shows the new atmosphere of the new year. At the same time, in the handwriting and tone, we can see the heroic spirit of the host of Lingke.
In front of the door is a field of cattails. Xiaofang said that in the early summer, when the breeze passes, the scene of "light silk skirts with new cattails" must be very poetic.
As soon as we entered the gate, without waiting for the host to politely offer us seats, none of us wanted to stay in the exquisite and bright living room. Everyone was greedily running around the garden, all trying to find something more novel and unknown. I ran from the front garden to the back garden, and the first thing that caught my attention was eight pots of blooming snow orchids and two lush lemon trees with green branches that never withered. They were metabolizing, contentedly blooming and bearing fruit. There were also three blooming cinnabar plum trees in the back garden, like beautifully dressed young women, both dignified and charming. After seeing all of this, I had a feeling that spring first visited Lingke before slowly and belatedly heading to the complex city.
Perhaps spring comes from the east. In Lingke, she had already opened her drowsy and charming eyes, but in the bustling city, she tiredly turned her weary head away. Otherwise, why do the plum blossoms in Lingke bloom first? Why do the leaves in Lingke fall later? I know that the countryside is nature's favorite, and Rousseau understood this best.
The host saw that we were a group of unruly guests, so he simply led us to climb the back mountain for a distant view. He stood on the top of an ancient tomb, gesturing and speaking, and our eyes followed his command. Over there is Zhang Fei Camp in Longquanyi, and over there are the Daxueshan and Xiaoxueshan mountains of Songli. Down there, at the foot of the mountains, lies the aging, vast ancient city. I followed those densely packed roofs that concealed the sins of the world, imagining that there was a river like a brocade belt among them, carrying the joys and sorrows of the city to the distance, disappearing into the hazy sea of memory.
Since the war, Mr. Li Jieren has been living in Lingke and has become so fond of it that he doesn't want to leave. Looking at the layout of his garden and the renovation of his house, it seems as if he has planned for a hundred years. I understand that he wants to defend the Lingke position in order to maintain his physical and mental well-being and to devote himself to writing. Just like Gide in Paris, who always wants to live on the seventh floor to maintain his physical and mental well-being. I had this feeling when I first arrived at Lingke.
It was half past two in the afternoon, and Liu Shengya and Chen Weimo had not yet arrived. Our stomachs were rumbling in protest. Fortunately, Miss Yuanshan brought out two plates of snacks, and everyone devoured them ravenously, revealing the exquisite antique porcelain plate bottoms in an instant. At three o'clock, Shengya and Weimo finally arrived leisurely. Everyone's hearts were filled with the joy of friendship. They came by pedicab, having mistakenly believed the driver's words and gone around in circles in Lingjiao Yan. In the end, they had to get out of the car and rely on their own feet to reach their destination. Being carried is not as good as walking on your own two feet, and being helped up is not as good as standing on your own. Life teaches us lessons everywhere.
Lunch consisted of four cold dishes and five hot dishes, including cold noodles, Russian cuisine, fried fish, egg rolls, abalone, winter bamboo shoots, crab roe, silver belly, and pig brains. Who says that art is a product of being well-fed? In my state of hunger, I was careful not to neglect the slow chewing and appreciation. Xianghe, who sat next to me, liked "color" but not "food." He had written a small book about growing flowers, so I called him a lecher. He once said: "If I were to invite guests, I would just stew a big pot of meat. Why bother with all the small dishes that take up so much time and space? In the end, it's all swallowed in one gulp." I didn't agree with his theory and had a debate with him. I think that cooking is a product of culture, and the combination of beautiful dishes with good color, aroma, and taste is like a complete poem or a segment of an ideal life, yearning for the source of life. Because the experience of human tastes has created cooking, and it is this experienced hand that has written the cultural history of mankind. Anatole France said: "In the library of the future, I will not read any cultural history or scientific history. I will only read a fashionable magazine to examine the women's clothing of a certain century. The clothing of these women will show me more about the humanistic spirit of the era than all the philosophers, novelists, prophets, and scientists." I am now imitating France's words and boldly saying: cooking is cultural history.
After lunch, we each drank a cup of strong coffee, and in accordance with the drunken and flushed mood, we ran to the garden again. Shengya suggested that I go to see the well, and I was reminded of Mr. Su Dongpo's homesickness, "Clearly, I dream of falling into my hometown." I said that everyone is nostalgic for their hometown, probably because of the water and soil. Wang Bingyang said that hometown is the countryside, and Mongolians commonly refer to a certain well as a certain yurt. For example, "the people of the marketplace." At this time, Ruji suddenly pointed to a pile of miscanthus stalks by the well and shouted: "SY, your stable is here!"
Ruji's bizarre interlude made everyone laugh. Because Ruji is a master of historical allusions, he often touches on inspiration and connects cause and effect, making people unable not to laugh. Just now at the banquet, Shengya (i.e., SY) boasted about his "Spring Festival Horse Race," but in reality, he is the youngest among us. Ruji meant to mock him for riding a hobbyhorse at a young age.
Later, Xianghe proposed: "Recently, a private literary group has invited us to give public lectures with ticket sales. What if someone in the future scolds the lecturers for using this as a means of raising money? The people who have been invited are all here now, so let's make a resolution." At this time, Li Jieren, with the majestic posture of a tiger, walked in the center of the living room, saying as he walked: "Since we have agreed, we cannot break our promise to the young people. We have a clear conscience, having not accepted a penny in compensation, so let people scold us." After a while, he continued: "The best way to stop slander is to cultivate oneself. I will go my own way."
At this time, the setting sun slanted into the living room from the wide corridor, and the whole room was filled with noble golden waves. The victorious clear sky seemed to be applauding us.

About Wang Tingshao Zizhen
The extant collections of folk songs from the Qing Dynasty known today include Zhang Zixu's "A Carefully Selected Collection of Popular Hua Diao Taiping Songs," the anonymous "Myriad Flowers Little Songs," "A Collection of Qing Sounds," "A Combined Collection of Western Tunes and Yellow Flowers," Wang Tingshao's "Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music," an anonymous "Little Songs for Silk String Instruments," Hua Guang's "Legacy of White Snow," and the anonymous "Combined Collection of Chang Cha and Cui Cha," among seven or eight others. Among them, "Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music" is the most well-known because it has a xylographic print, and "Legacy of White Snow" has a selected edition. However, the editors of these two books are still unknown to this day. Hua Guang is likely a person whose name is not known outside of Min, and it seems difficult to find historical materials about him. However, Wang Tingshao was relatively wealthy.
The preface to "Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music" by Wang himself does not reveal much about his life, only that he was a scholar. However, the preface by Sheng An states: "Mr. possesses the talent of carving dragons and embroidering tigers, and his writings are prolific. In addition to essays for the imperial examinations and poems, he occasionally indulges in leisurely emotions, composing elegant songs that are lingering and melancholic, following in the footsteps of those in the Flower Garden School." He must have been a somewhat well-known figure. Although a detailed history has not yet been seen, the following scattered historical materials can give a glimpse of Wang's life.
A more detailed record is found in Bao Guixing's "Manuscripts of Nostalgic Poems by Maosheng" (old xylographic edition, volume 1), volume 2:
"Wang Kaitang, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, whose given name was Tingshao, was a native of Daxing. He was reassigned as a Principal Secretary after being a Shujishi, and remained in the Ministry of Justice for twenty years. He twice participated in the literary selection for the Ministry of Rites, and Chen Sanyuan (Jichang) was a student of his. He died at the age of fifty-eight as a Yuanwailang. He was poor but proud, looking down on everything. His voice was loud and clear, surprising those around him wherever he went. His poetry was influenced by Du Fu, profound and heartfelt. He was quick-witted and talented in many arts. He planted flowers and bamboo in his small room; he sang songs and drank wine, enjoying himself freely. He was one year older than me, and we both passed the provincial and metropolitan examinations together. After I retired from office, he visited me even more frequently. He struggled to have an heir, so he adopted his nephew Xiaolian's (Rubi) son as his own. He passed away suddenly when his adopted son was only four years old, and both his adopted grandson and orphaned daughter died young. It is difficult to bear the pain!" His poem also says:
"He served in the Hanlin Academy for three years and as a teacher for twenty years. His students include Cai Wenji, and his disciples include Peng Xuan. He no longer discusses military affairs, and who will pass on his bitter verses? My old friend's head is like a heap of dirt, and I mourn him deeply by the wine jar."
Bao's "Nostalgic Poems" do not mention his year of birth, so Wang's birth and death dates cannot be calculated. It is only known that Bao was a Juren in the Qianlong year of Renzi (the fifty-seventh year) and a Jinshi in the Jiaqing year of Jiwei (the fourth year). Wang also passed the provincial and metropolitan examinations with him in the same years of Renzi and Jiwei. Ji Yun also served as his teacher, so volume six of the "Shenyang Continued Records" mentions "Wang Tingshao, a student of Ji Yun."
Liang Zhangju also recorded two trivial matters about him in "Continued Notes on Antithetical Couplets." One is found in volume three: "Wang Kaitang, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice (Tingshao), a native of Beizhili, repeatedly participated in the spring and autumn literary selections and obtained many excellent scholars from the southern provinces. Chen Lianshi, the top scholar in all three levels of the imperial examinations, was one of his students." Another is found in volume four: "Wang Kaitang grew old in the Ministry of Justice and was very poor. His house had a horse stable next to it, and the door faced the main road. He wrote a couplet himself and hung it on the doorpost, saying: 'The horse bones are thin, but they eat not only noodles but also grass; the sound of the cart is rumbling, pulling people and horses but not pulling money.' Those who see it cannot help but smile."
Based on the above documents, his life story is: his name was Tingshao, his courtesy name was Kaitang, and he was from Daxing in Zhili ("The preface to 'Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music' is entitled Moling"). He was a Juren in the Qianlong year of Renzi (the fifty-seventh year) and a Jinshi in the Jiaqing year of Jiwei (the fourth year). He was reassigned from Shujishi to a Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Justice and ended his career as a Yuanwailang after ten years, at the age of fifty-eight. He was poor, proud, and fond of poetry.
The preface to "Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music" states that the songs sung by the musical troupes in the capital were mostly passed down orally and gradually faded into obscurity. Yan, a song master from the Sanhe Hall, fearing their loss, collected them and had them engraved. "Because there were many errors, he asked me to correct them... Although I reluctantly obeyed the orders of my friends, I did not correct the mistakes, and I certainly did not revise the vulgar and absurd passages. After the title was woven, I felt very uneasy. However, the lyrics were made by them, and I cannot add to my beauty, nor can I add to my ugliness." Judging from this, he only corrected the typos, but did not get involved in the editing or revision. He was actually an editor in name only, probably because the song master wanted to use Wang's name to add weight to himself. The actual editor of this book should be Song Master Yan from the Sanli Hall. According to the "Miscellaneous Operas in Celebration of Longevity" attached at the end of the book, there is a poem by Yan, signed "Yan Zide from Tianjin, a lyricist." All that is known about him is his surname and address; nothing else can be verified.

De Nake River Keke Xiuka
Oskar Kokoschka (1886-) is an outstanding German modern painter and a particularly novel figure in modern novel painting styles. In his oil paintings, whether figures or landscapes, he likes to use primary colors. When he is in high spirits, he often squeezes the color bottle directly onto the canvas without having to use a brush to mix other colors. The thickness of the color exceeds that of Gokh, a late impressionist, so some people call him the "Nordic Gokh." However, his achievements are much worse than Gokh's. This work is representative of him, but unfortunately, single-color printing cannot show its advantages. (Lion)
An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 314 Ye Jingfeng
"After arriving at the Cathay Hotel?"
"After arriving at the Cathay Hotel," the fellow's dumb face suddenly showed a strange smile, "Miss first allowed and condoled and waited on the left, Miss measured the height and breadth of the house, once just about to step into the hall, two young men and women walked out of the main entrance of the hotel hall..."
"Hmm...?" He Jian expressed surprise; he seemed to ask the rickshaw puller to explain more clearly.
"...One young man and one young woman." At this point, the rickshaw puller tightly closed his dumb mouth, bowed twice to Yun Tong. This was a courtesy brought about by He Jian's "hmm." He bowed again and again, expressing that he could not speak clearly and had to apologize.
"Go on!" He Jian was listening attentively, and he was a little angry to see the rickshaw puller suddenly shut up.
"Yes, yes, yes, ... One young man and one young woman, the young man is wearing a military uniform of the Great Japanese Army, his expression is flying and his spirit is energetic. ... The young woman is wearing a uniform of the Great Japanese students, the spirit of her beautiful face is shining like the cherry blossoms in March and the chrysanthemums in September, adding a few smiles, with the posture of a first-class beauty..."
Before being a rickshaw puller, this fellow was probably not a poet, but a writer. He Jian and Zheng Yan were amused and couldn't help laughing when they heard these pretentious words, even though they were full of thoughts. Seeing that the expressions of the two people were somewhat happy, thinking

### British Ministry of Food Comes to China to Purchase, Egg Exports Gradually See a Turnaround, Major Loss Due to Carelessness at Maochang Warehouse, but No Impact on Order Contracts

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, regarding the matter of our country's egg exports, a reporter visited Mr. Zheng Yuan, the General Manager of Maochang Company in this city, to inquire about the detailed process. He graciously provided detailed answers, and the main points are recorded as follows: He stated: The egg products exported from our country are divided into three types: 1. Frozen Eggs: The British Ministry of Food intends to order 9,000 tons from our country at a price of Â£200 per ton, which will be undertaken by the Frozen Egg Industry Association. Due to cost concerns, the association repeatedly requested the Export Promotion Committee to transfer the matter to the Central Trust Bureau for assistance, earnestly requesting that the bureau be responsible for purchasing. The responsibility for manufacturing and sales would then rest with the Frozen Egg Industry Association. As a result, the Frozen Egg Industry Association and the Central Trust Bureau signed a contract on the 4th of this month to manufacture 5,000 tons of frozen eggs, priced at 9 million legal currency per ton, to be paid in five installments. The first installment was completed on the 7th of this month, and subsequent installments will be processed accordingly. Currently, members of the Frozen Egg Industry Association are planning to purchase fresh eggs and arrange commencement matters. 2. Dried Whole Egg Powder: The quantity is 250 tons, priced at Â£720 per ton, currently under negotiation, with the same procedure as above. 3. Dried Egg White: 100 tons, Egg Yolk: 400 tons, currently, the Far East Egg Products Manufacturing Joint Company is jointly requesting the Export Promotion Committee to transfer the matter to the Central Trust Bureau for assistance, and a decision is expected soon. The British Ministry of Food also intends to purchase all three types of egg products listed above.

Stable Egg Prices

As for current egg prices, he believes they are still relatively stable and unlikely to undergo any changes. He only hopes that rice prices and other commodity prices can also remain stable. This time, the company's rented warehouse on Nanxun Road suffered a loss due to carelessness. According to Mr. Zheng's post-incident investigation, the estimated loss is 12,831 fresh eggs. However, he stated that this loss has no impact on egg prices, because the lost eggs were purchased by the company before the Frozen Egg Industry Association and the Central Trust Bureau signed the contract, and were intended as extra preparation. Therefore, the loss suffered was part of that extra preparation. However, the above incident has no impact on the order contract signed with the Central Trust Bureau, nor on the quantity of egg products manufactured by the company. This is because the company began preparing to resume work on the 20th of last month and officially started work on the 5th of this month. Although it unfortunately encountered a disaster on the night of the 8th, resulting in the total destruction of the egg sorting room and the egg stacking room, our company can find a way to restore the spaces originally intended for refrigeration and egg sorting, but currently used as ordinary passenger and freight warehouses, to their original state for use as egg sorting and stacking rooms. As for other egg production sites within the factory, there was no damage. Therefore, our company will be able to resume work soon, and there will be no problem with the quantity of eggs produced.

Estimated Losses

According to Mr. Zheng's investigation: The company's fire loss this time is estimated to be 2.4 billion national currency for fresh eggs, 890 million national currency for packaging materials, and 2 billion national currency for buildings and equipment. However, the fresh eggs and packaging materials were insured with British Tai Koo Company for Â£60,000. There is no problem with compensation. The buildings and equipment were not insured. Mr. Zheng stated that in addition to the cold storage warehousing business being conducted as usual, the ordinary warehousing aspect of the company will gradually cease operations starting today. All ordinary passenger and freight goods stored will be urged to be cleared. Even for rented parts, we intend to negotiate with tenants to vacate and take them back for our own use to avoid further complications, he said.

### Although the Market Suffered Interference, Chinese Stocks' Underlying Strength Still Shines

Yesterday, major Chinese stock holders showed even more intention to increase their long positions, and continued to thrive. External interference promoted counteraction. However, because the black market prices of various kinds had no decrease, the assistance from foreign stocks and purchasing often rebounded after the fall. When the market opened in the morning, it was reported that Commander Xuan had sent an official letter to the mayor, which stated that attention should be paid to the stock market, resulting in lower market prices. After opening, Deyong Yarn, from numbers 85, 226, and 180, was sold to 3180 yuan. Numbers 106, 76, 4, 198, 185, 78, 153, 145, 171, 199, 167, and 224 all advanced. New Asia, China Silk, and Qinxing successively reached their daily limit increases. Deyong Yarn gradually increased to 33370 yuan. Numbers 36, 117, 177, 99, and 231 were sold at higher prices and slightly stabilized. Afterwards, sudden external interference caused widespread panic. Numbers 97, 196, 156, 12, 105, 133, 76, 232, and 85 competed to sell. After 10:30, adversity suddenly arose, and in an instant, prices fell by more than 200 yuan, to 3130 yuan. Numbers 205, 218, and 177 took advantage of the low price to enter at 3250 yuan. Numbers 99, 47, and 198 sold again, but it was still difficult to support. Numbers 235, 190, 4, and 207 sold at 310 yuan. Numbers 218, 47, 61, 198, 76, 107, 105, 8, 2, and 11 rushed to buy, and prices rose again to 3210 yuan. Police authorities sent personnel to the market to investigate, and everyone hoped for a quick resolution. Numbers 28, 207, and 223 all exited. Numbers 218 and 97 entered and then exited. Before closing, prices returned to around 3110 yuan. After closing, quoted prices rose slightly. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Qinxing rose by half a percent, Xinguang and Xinhua were flat, and Huafeng rose slightly due to the addition of six new approvals and three additional issuances of information. Deyong Yarn, Xinhe, Meiya, and Zhongfa each fell by about half a percent. In deferred transactions, Deyong Yarn, Xinhe, and Meiya fell by half a percent, Xinguang was flat, and Huafeng rose slightly. Cold stocks Yonggong fell by slightly less than 10 percent, Datong, Tongyi, and Match each fell by 0.5 percent, China Silk and New Asia reached their daily limit increases, and the rest were flat.

In the afternoon, numbers 203, 185, 85, and 218 all entered, and Deyong Yarn rose to 3210 yuan. New Asia and China Silk still reached their daily limit increases. Numbers 183, 94, and 145 closed at higher prices, falling back to 3150 yuan. Numbers 61, 171, 185, 14, 24, 117, 142, 223, 28, 207, 106, 152, and 154 jointly purchased, rising to 3320 yuan. Numbers 218, 97, 235, 149, 180, 141, 185, 223, and 199 sold again, falling back to 3230 yuan. Numbers 14, 36, 105, and 198 still entered, approaching 3300 yuan again. However, there were quite a few limited-price supplies, such as numbers 199, 106, 137, 31, 145, 35, 131, and 185, as well as retail investors who were all selling. Off-market continued auditing, except for Xinguang, Huafeng, and Qinxing, closed at lower prices. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Meiya was flat, Qinxing rose by more than 10 percent, Huafeng and Xinguang rose by about 0.5 percent, Zhongfa and Xinhua rose slightly, and Yongsha and Xinhe fell slightly. In deferred transactions, Xinhe fell by 0.5 percent, Xinguang rose by 0.5 percent, Huafeng rose slightly, Yongsha and Meiya fell slightly, cold stocks New Asia and China Silk stopped again, Cement Wuhe rose by 10 percent, Yonggong fell by 0.5 percent, and the remaining stocks showed both gains and losses. Off-market stocks, except for Wuzhou, which rose slightly, were mostly peaceful.

### Optimistic Sentiment, National Bonds Continue to Rise

Yesterday, public bonds rose further due to reports that the Municipal Senate was also discussing how to reorganize old debts, which boosted sentiment. Major players such as Chengde, Room 512, and Room 360 made additions, while Room 550 and Room 501 exited. Unified Type C opened at 15,000 yuan, with a high price of 15,700 yuan, a low price of 14,400 yuan, and finally hovered around 15,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Types A, B, and E each rose by 1,700, Unified Type C rose by 1,800, and Type D rose by 1,400. Turnover reached 10 million yuan again.

### Foreign Stocks' Appetite Still Eager

Yesterday, foreign stocks, due to the rampant black market prices that had been banned, individual buyers came looking for substitutes, and short sellers covered their positions. Foreign firms and Guangbang all entered. Yisha started from an initial price of 33,800 yuan in the morning and rose to a high price of 37,000 yuan before pulling back. As a result, steel industry trading was low and slightly weak, Yipi rose slightly, British United rose by 10 percent, and the rest rose by 0.5 percent.

### Cotton Cloth Full of Vitality, Sentiment Firm, Quoted Prices Rise

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was that because textile construction opened with limited chips, sentiment was smooth and firm, the market atmosphere was vigorous, and quoted prices continued to rise. The fine cloth market outside the market was not weak, and it was heard that the Tianjin gang was constantly searching for raw color goods and white plain fine cloth. Longtou fine cloth was again quoted as high as 193,000 to 194,000 yuan, Wufu 185,000 yuan, and other brands also followed up by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Biji even had retail investors pushing up the price again by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, to 198,000 yuan, and Jinyun Miaowu and Tiaoli Biji also rose by varying amounts of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Bleached cloth, raw cloth, twill poplin, etc., also unanimously improved in price, from 5,000 to 6,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. The factory of high-end goods for Shilin cloth increased costs, so the market situation was also firm.

### Rayon Unchanged

Yesterday, the market for 120-count rayon, Gaoshan, opened at 8.1 million yuan. Because it was known that 2,500 boxes had arrived at the port, sentiment was unusually weak, and prices spiraled downwards, with the lowest quoted price being 7.9 million yuan. Later, rumors spread that there would be no distribution this week, and the market rebounded, finally selling at 8.15 million yuan. As a result, it was even with the previous day. The factory agent's market yesterday was very light, and quoted prices were similar to the previous day. D-grade retail had transactions at 8.5 million yuan. The Qianjing business was rarely open, silk goods and quilt covers went well at 50,000 yuan, and Dacheng Gebi opened at 8.5 million to 8 million yuan. There was no shortage of people taking advantage of the low prices, so the quoted prices slowly rose, and the final traded price was 9.3 million yuan for single orders. There was little change in the rayon goods market yesterday.

### Silver Shops Shorten Business Hours

Since the Ministry of Finance issued new business regulations for the silver shop industry, the industry has complied with the ministry's orders and resumed business. However, because sales are high and deposits are low, it is difficult to sustain. According to the person in charge of the Silver Shop Industry Association of this city, there are rumors that the silver shop industry will go to Beijing again to petition. The silver shop industry currently has no such plan. However, in order to maintain the future of the business, the only option is to shorten business hours. Currently, silver shops in this city open at 10:00 am and close at 4:00 pm every day, and only sell enough to offset the day's outflow, and are unwilling to sell more, he said.

### Sugar Allocation Warehouse Receipts Limited to Delivery, Overdue Purchase at Original Price, City Government Authorities Agree with This Measure
