### Great Victory of the National Army Outside Yulin: Peng's Seven Brigades Completely Annihilated; Fu Zuoyi Sends Special Telegram to Ma Hongda to Congratulate

[Our Correspondent in Zhangjiakou, 16th] The Yulin defense battle, after two months of hard fighting, has once again achieved a great victory. The bandits mobilized forces of up to ten brigades, totaling thirty regiments, while the defending troops had only three regiments and were inferior in weaponry. Nevertheless, they were ultimately able to overcome the enemy and achieve victory. The bandits once used intense artillery fire to break through the city walls and infiltrate the city, but they were all annihilated and driven back, turning danger into safety. The bandits, having suffered this severe blow, will inevitably be unable to recover and will find it difficult to run rampant again.

[Our Correspondent in Zhangjiakou, 16th] Military News: The brave Ningxia troops of infantry and cavalry, sent to aid Yulin, attracted the main force of the communist bandits in the Liangjiutan area, fifty li northwest of Yulin, and fought fiercely for two days and nights, achieving a complete victory. Peng Dehuai, in a desperate gamble, personally led seven brigades to intercept the supporting troops, but they were crushed and annihilated, and it is possible that Peng himself was captured. On the night of the 14th, the battle reached its climax. The bandits once broke through the National Army's positions, but after the officers and soldiers bravely resisted, using broadswords, bayonets, shovels, picks, and engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, the intensity was unprecedented. Repeatedly charging and counter-charging, they lost and regained ground several times. By dawn on the 15th, the bandits were completely routed, and the National Army is now dividing its forces to pursue and annihilate them. General Deng Binshan personally led mechanized units from Zhasak Banner to Liangjiutan to provide support. The Yulin defending forces also launched a flanking attack from the rear of the bandits, forming a three-sided encirclement, completing the encirclement, and launching a large-scale annihilation battle. The main force of the bandit army, seven brigades in total, was completely annihilated, no longer able to form an army, and is about to be completely wiped out.

[Further Telegram] When news of the victory at Liangjiutan in Yulin arrived, people here were extremely excited. Fu Zuoyi, Director of the Zhangyuan Pacification Headquarters, sent a telegram to Ma Hongkui, Chairman of Ningxia, congratulating him, pointing out that this battle not only laid the foundation for northern Shaanxi, but also reversed the overall situation in the Northwest. Also, Deng Binshan sent a telegram to Zhangjiakou, reporting the great victory at Yulin, praising the success of Director Fu's strategic plan.

[Further Telegram] Fu Zuoyi flew from Zhangjiakou this afternoon to Ping, to meet with Director Li of the Executive Headquarters, to report on the course of the Yulin relief.

At present, the fighting is most intense in the southeast and northeast of the city. Although the bandits have repeatedly attacked the vocational school in the west of the city and the Chishen Temple and Yubao in the southwest, they have all been repelled.

[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 16th] The National Army recovered Xiangling on the 11th. Bandits in the Zhaocheng area have infiltrated near Linfen, showing signs of attacking Lincheng again. After the National Army captured Maojindu and Pinglu County, the army and people of Yuncheng were encouraged. The bandits attacking Yuncheng used coffins to carry bombs, attempting to use tunnels to destroy the city defenses, but the defending troops are taking strict precautions.

### The Situation in Xuzhou is Extremely Stable; Communist Bandits in the Suburbs are Continuously Being Repelled; The National Army in Henan Recaptures Nanzhao City

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 16th] On the night of the 15th, National Army reinforcements arrived and repelled the communist bandits outside Xuzhou, and the city of Xu is peaceful. After Gu Zhutong flew to Nanjing a few days ago to meet with Chairman Jiang to request instructions, he returned to Xu by way of Nanjing at 2 PM on the 15th.

[Our Correspondent in Yanzhou, 16th] The situation around Xuzhou is largely stable. Although the bandits who infiltrated the suburbs of the city from Yanglou, 28 li southwest of the city, and the Erbao, Sanbao, and Gaojiaying areas along the Jinpu Railway, are still coming on fiercely, and several shells even landed in the urban area for a time, the situation has eased from today onwards. The National Army, after reinforcements and with the assistance of the air force, has gradually repelled the invading bandits. The fighting is still continuing.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] The National Army is gathering in Xuzhou and advancing on the bandits in several directions. They routed the remnants of the 4th Column of the bandits along the Old Yellow River line. Another National Army unit, attacking from Jiagou in Feng County, has reached its designated location, and a decisive annihilation battle is about to begin. The 11th Column of the bandit army, which was defeated northwest of Xuzhou, was intercepted again by the Tongshan Security Regiment near Wugangji on the north bank of the Old Yellow River on the evening of the 15th, and a fierce battle immediately broke out. The bandits suffered heavy losses and were unable to escape south. On the 16th, they turned back to the Liuji Liuxingzhuang area and were again blocked by a National Army unit. The fighting is still fierce.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 16th] After part of Liu's 11th Column was defeated by the National Army at Liuji, northwest of Xuzhou, on the 14th, it fled towards Jinganji. Part of Chen's 1st Column infiltrated Yaolou (15 kilometers southwest of Xuzhou), and the National Army is blocking them, and fierce fighting is underway.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 16th] The fighting north of Caocun on the Jinpu Railway was quiet on the 16th, with only some contact at dawn. National Army reinforcements are continuously moving forward to Qianqian, and are advancing in search. Military trains heading north can reach Fuliji. Military trains north and south of the Suxian station are moving in an endless stream, and mechanized units are also participating in the battle. Only one special express train runs between Bengbu and Pukou each day.

[Our Correspondent in Kaifeng, 15th] The bandits who had infiltrated and occupied Nanzhao in southwestern Henan were unable to withstand the fierce attack by a strong unit of the National Army yesterday afternoon and collapsed, scattering into the Funiu Mountain area. The National Army recovered Nanzhao County at 12 noon yesterday.

### Fierce Battles in Shouguang, Shandong; Large Forces Gather in Gaomi

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 16th] After three days and nights of fierce fighting in Shouguang, National Army reinforcements arrived on the 16th, and the situation has turned stable. For the past two days, the air force has repeatedly dispatched planes to participate in the battle in Shouguang, greatly boosting the morale of the defending troops and killing many bandits. The fighting was most intense on the night of the 15th. By the morning of the 16th, part of the communist bandits had retreated, while another part continued to attack the city. The retreating bandits encountered the National Army near Sunjiaji, and fierce fighting continues.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 16th] Another major battle is brewing near Gaomi. The entire 2nd, 9th, and 7th Columns and the 10th Division of the 4th Column of the bandits infiltrated the outskirts of Gaomi on the 15th and engaged in fierce fighting with the forward units of the National Army. Currently, large forces of the National Army are gathering in Gaomi. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, the National Army in Haiyang continued to attack the bandits on the 15th, annihilating about a regiment of the 13th Column of the bandits and capturing more than ten important villages and strongholds.

### Britain Raises Objections to Parts of Foreign Exchange; Sino-Hong Kong Agreement Awaits Further Negotiations; New Anti-Smuggling Measures Implemented Since Yesterday

[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 16th] The reason why the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement has not yet been announced, according to reliable information, is that after the foreign exchange and trade sections of the agreement were agreed upon, the British side temporarily raised objections to the handling of public commissions and overseas remittances in Hong Kong, causing the agreement to be shelved again. It is now reported that the authorities have dispatched Foreign Advisor Rogers of the Ministry of Finance and Yu Renjie, a member of the Exchange Equalization Fund, to Hong Kong to conduct decisive negotiations with the British side.

[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 15th] The Sino-Hong Kong joint anti-smuggling measures were decided to be implemented from the 15th. From now on, any goods transported from Hong Kong to Chinese ports must have their manifests certified by the Hong Kong authorities, otherwise they will be treated as smuggled goods. However, this does not apply to goods carried on the same ship that are transported to China from elsewhere or unloaded in Hong Kong and transported to other foreign ports.

### New Director of the Guangzhou Executive Headquarters, Song Ziwen, Takes Office Today; The Guangdong-Guangxi Security Conference Opens Simultaneously

[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 16th] Zhang Fakui, Director of the Guangzhou Executive Headquarters, has been transferred to the Strategic Advisory Committee, and Song Ziwen has been appointed to succeed him. It is reported that the two will formally hand over on the 17th. It is said that Zhang Fakui will fly to Nanjing at the end of the month to assume his new post, and then quickly return to eastern Guangdong to engage in agricultural reclamation work. The city of Guangzhou is preparing to hold a grand welcoming and farewell gathering on the 17th. Public opinion here has given positive reviews to Song's assumption of the Executive Headquarters, recognizing it as the beginning of a civilian leading military and political affairs. Based on Song's past achievements in managing the Tax Police Corps, he will surely have a good performance.

[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 16th] The Guangdong-Guangxi Security Conference was originally scheduled to be held in Guangzhou on the 16th, presided over by Director Zhang. However, due to Director Zhang's inability to fly to Guangzhou, it was specially rescheduled to open on the 17th, and will be presided over by Song Ziwen, lasting for two days. In addition, the Guangzhou Executive Headquarters has recently announced that all Communist Party members under its jurisdiction must report to their respective governments by the end of the year for a fresh start, otherwise they will be severely punished as bandit military spies.

### Ministry of National Defense Transfers Two Regiments of Troops to Hainan Island to Suppress Bandits

[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 15th] Bandits are rampant on Hainan Island. Chairman Song discussed with the Ministry of National Defense during his recent visit to Nanjing the transfer of two regiments of the National Army to Qiong to suppress them. This has been approved, and one regiment of a certain army and another reserve regiment have been transferred to Qiongya, specifically responsible for suppression. Furthermore, after the large-scale encirclement and suppression of the Lu Neng gang in southern Guangdong, a portion of them recently fled to sea on six large junks, attempting to land on Hainan Island. They were discovered by naval gunboats and pursued, and three bandit ships were sunk, with heavy casualties.

### Bandit Forces in the Northeast Disintegrating; Shenyang Gradually Returning to Peace

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] The sixth offensive by the bandits in the Northeast has collapsed, and the traffic in the Shenyang area will be restored within days. At the same time, with the recovery of Dashiqiao, the traffic between Shenyang and Yingkou is also expected to open. Prices here are gradually falling, and the southern area has entered a state of peace.

### Banditry Completely Cleared on the Eastern, Northern, and Southern Sides of Changchun

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The banditry in the outer strongholds of Mishazi and Kalun, to the north and east of Changchun, has been completely cleared.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The main forces of the Third and Fourth Columns of the bandits and the Independent First and Second Divisions in eastern Manchuria are currently entrenched south of Yitong and east of Shuangyang for reorganization. The scattered remnants of the bandit forces, such as the main forces of the First, Second, and Sixth Columns, have now infiltrated into the territory of Huaide County, west of the Middle Chang Railway, shivering in the frigid snowy plains of minus twenty degrees Celsius. Tens of thousands of bandit soldiers' cold-proof leather clothing is still far from the supply line, thousands of miles away. Currently, the bandit army along the Jichang Railway, fearing a pincer attack by the National Army from the east and west, has begun moving south in recent days.

### Archbishop Yu Bin Speaks in the United States: China is Fighting for Democracy; Currency Inflation is the Main Reason

[United Press, Washington, 15th] Archbishop Yu Bin reported to the Board of Directors of the Washington Chinese Cultural Society on the 15th, saying that China is fighting for democracy to resist the communist bandits. The communist bandits are equipped by the Soviet army and partly commanded by Soviet officers. China is not in a civil war, but a life-and-death battle against communism. This is the beginning of the Soviet Union's launch of an international anti-democratic war. If the Chinese Communists attempt to build an independent sovereign state in the Northeast, World War III will begin. Therefore, calling the war in China a civil war is only half true. Chinese communism is the same as communism everywhere else, and is commanded by the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Archbishop Yu Bin said on the 15th that China's anti-communist war is the main reason for currency inflation. Currency inflation has bankrupted the Chinese economy and encouraged inefficiency and corruption. Archbishop Yu Bin said that during this visit to the United States, he learned that Americans criticized the Chinese National Government as undemocratic, fascist, and illiberal, but he attacked these views, believing that the Communist Party often calls its opponents fascists. He said that the Soviet Communist Party-led "International Brigade," which includes Korean, Mongolian, and Japanese troops and Soviet officers, is currently fighting in the Northeast, and constitutes one-third of the communist troops in the Northeast.

### American Parties Concerned About the Situation in China; Attitudes Towards Aid Vary in Urgency

[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] When the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the US Senate and the House of Representatives heard reports on the aid to Europe plan this week, the China issue was suddenly raised for discussion, leading to a question: which party, Republican or Democratic, is more interested in including the China issue in the current emergency plan? To date, Republican members of Congress and political figures have taken the lead over Democrats in advocating aid to China, led by Senate Speaker and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Vandenberg, and including Taft, Brewster, Smith, Judd, and Fulton. House Republican Speaker Martin is also strongly advocating immediate support for China, and another important Republican figure, New York Governor Dewey, has also recently strongly advocated aid to China. During a week of discussions in Congress, only Representative Kee of West Virginia mentioned the issue of aid to China. Kee only mentioned the matter incidentally, asking Secretary Marshall to compare the emergency aid from the United States to Western Europe with aid to China. Marshall never spontaneously discusses the policies of the State Department, and only reluctantly announces them under pressure. He estimates that 300 million US dollars is needed to curb the current currency inflation in China. The current question is why the Republican Party has expressed its opinion on aid to China far more urgently than the Democratic Party, and the Republicans can be divided into three factions: one is Judd and others with similar views, who believe that the crisis in China is at least as urgent as that in Western European countries, if not more so. They want to include China in the emergency aid plan. Marshall believes that although the situation in China is serious, it can wait a while, so it can be delayed until the aid to Europe plan takes effect. Marshall has always acknowledged that the United States must aid China, and this week he claimed that aid is very difficult, and a satisfactory solution has not yet been found. The second faction is Vandenberg and other Republicans, who believe that the aid to China issue must be included in the US world plan. They do not want to force the aid to China issue into the emergency aid plan, nor do they insist on reaching a decision in a special Congress. The third faction believes that aid to China is purely a political issue. The leaders of this faction are Dewey and Taft. They are not too eager for large loans to aid China, but they attack Truman and the State Department for not including the China issue as part of the overall world situation. According to some people, if a proper plan for aid to China cannot be established in Congress in January next year, then aid to China will become one of the major political issues in the presidential election, which Truman wants to avoid. But currently, the Republican Party is undoubtedly gathering capital for the general election on this issue. Other observers believe that the Democratic Party is equally concerned about the China issue, but is being too cautious because it has not yet decided how to proceed. It is said that Democratic leaders will wait for Truman and Marshall's decisions before beginning the work of aiding China. It is widely believed that the Democratic Party does not want to talk about aid to China at this time, also for political reasons. Some speculate that the Democratic Party wants the Republican Party to first propose a proposal for aid to China, because if the Democratic Party formulates a complete foreign aid plan, the burden on American taxpayers will be too heavy, and it will be easier to obtain funds in Congress when the Republican Party proposes it. According to a Democratic observer, the current arguments to include the issue of aid to China in the emergency relief plan are an attempt to induce Marshall to publish the Wedemeyer Report.

### Legislative Elections Begin; Three Parties to Confer Today on the Number of Candidates; National Assembly Meeting Date May Be Postponed

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] The legislative elections are about to begin, but the allocation of quotas for the three parties has not yet been decided. It is reported that the Kuomintang has scheduled a meeting on the afternoon of the 17th to invite representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to confer, and a solution may be decided. It is known that the Youth Party hopes for a quota of 120 seats, and the Democratic Socialist Party hopes for a quota of 160 seats, but this is still subject to consultation and decision. The Standing Committee of the Kuomintang has scheduled an extraordinary meeting for the morning of the 17th to discuss and review the methods for the list of candidates for the Legislative Yuan.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] A certain senior official recently told reporters that the general election will be held as scheduled, but the date of the National Assembly meeting may be postponed due to factual issues. There are two ways to postpone it: one is to hold the opening ceremony and then adjourn the meeting for several days before holding the meeting again; the other is to decide the date of the meeting by issuing a summons, as in the past year.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Holding a general election in China, no matter when, is not an easy task, because a nationwide election has never been held. The fierce civil war, currency inflation, and transportation difficulties make the election of 3,024 representatives to the National Assembly from November 21 to 23 all the more difficult. The government originally planned to print 150 million ballots in the central region, but due to transportation difficulties, distribution is not easy, and it has to be printed in separate regions, and the malpractices are predictable. It is estimated that seven out of ten voters are illiterate, so the secret election stipulated by the constitution is almost impossible. The government has hired thousands of ballot writers, and students from all over the country will be mobilized to assist at that time. There are no candidates' names on the ballots, and the list will be posted in large format everywhere, but the voters are illiterate, making it difficult to maintain secrecy. There is no campaign movement nationwide, and there is only competition between the party headquarters in Nanjing. There is no sign of an upcoming election elsewhere. Some neutral observers believe that China's election not only does not help the cause of democracy, but also harms it, because this is not the time. Opponents say that everything must have a beginning, and even an imperfect election is better than nothing. Both sides have reasons, but Chairman Jiang is determined to enable China to hold an unprecedented general election from November 21 to 23 to achieve democracy.

### Dai Chuanxian, Hu Zongnan, and Others Give Up National Assembly Candidate Status

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Director Dai recently sent a letter to Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, and others, asking them to report to the Central Committee on his behalf, requesting the withdrawal of his nomination as a candidate for the National Assembly.

[Another Telegram] Ms. Ma Peizhang, wife of Bai Chongxi, was previously publicly recommended by the Nanjing Islamic Association as a candidate for the National Assembly, but after Ms. Ma's repeated firm refusals, and after approval by the Election Guidance Committee, the Islamic Association has specially telegraphed the branch associations in various provinces to note this.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 16th] Hu Zongnan, Director of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, was previously nominated as a candidate for the National Assembly from his ancestral home of Xiaofeng, Zhejiang. Hu said that at this time when the fighting against the bandits is tense, he has no time to participate, and has submitted a request to the Central Committee to give up his candidacy. In addition, Shaanxi Chairman Zhu Shaozhou, also due to busy official duties, has telegraphed the Hangzhou City Party Department, wishing to give up his nomination as a candidate for the National Assembly.

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] According to reliable sources today, a total of 35 people from the Kuomintang side have voluntarily given up their qualifications as candidates for the National Assembly, all of whom are senior military officers. Chen Cheng and Yu Zhutong are also among them. This is the result of Chairman Jiang's persuasion last week.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] The election work for the Shanxi Provincial Supervisory Committee has begun. This morning, the Provincial Assembly held an election meeting, and Li Jiang, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, represented Yan Xishan and attended the meeting to explain the proceedings. It is scheduled to complete the nomination of candidates on the 19th, hold a vote on the 22nd, and announce the list of elected candidates on the 23rd.

[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 16th] With the election of the National Assembly approaching, the Wuxian Election Office announced yesterday the list of administrators and supervisors for the polling places, and scheduled a meeting tomorrow to convene the heads of various vocational groups and candidates to discuss the procedures.

Editorial

### How to Restrict Japan's Industrial Standards?

The Asian Regional Preparatory Conference of the International Labour Organization concluded in New Delhi on the 10th. The conference passed an important proposal by our country's representatives to determine Japan's industrial standards and oppose dumping; however, the details of the original proposal have not yet been published in the newspapers. Regarding the issue of determining Japan's industrial standards, that is, the issue of restricting Japan's industrial standards, various countries had already put forward plans, but our country's counter-proposal is still lacking. It is reported that the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are actively collecting materials and conducting detailed research. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has also sent the Director of the Industrial Affairs Department to Shanghai to solicit opinions from the Shanghai industrial community and seek opinions from the public. The Shanghai industrial and commercial community is also actively contributing to this effort. This shows that the issue of restricting Japan's industrial standards has become a matter of extreme concern to our country, both government and public. If our country cannot put forward a correct counter-proposal, the victory won on the battlefield for eight years will inevitably be defeated on a piece of peace treaty paper. Therefore, it is said that how to restrict Japan's industrial standards should be a matter of deep concern to both government and public.

Regarding how to restrict Japan's industrial standards, in terms of theory and technology, it is necessary to first determine how to preserve Japan's living standards. The so-called industrial standards and living standards are certainly completely different: this is a difference in nature, not a difference in interrelationship. The living standards of a country's people should be the sum of all industrial equipment and its productivity. If the people's livelihood of a country needs industry to maintain it, then industrial standards are one of the factors determining its living standards: but it is by no means to say that living standards are completely determined by industrial standards. The reason for this is, firstly, because living necessities are not all produced by industry, especially in so-called agricultural countries; secondly, because industrial products are not all necessary for maintaining the lives of their people, especially military industrial products. Therefore, when discussing restricting Japan's industrial standards, it is necessary to calculate and first determine the living standards to be preserved for a certain year, and then determine the industrial standards that should be retained, which would be more reasonable.

According to which criteria should the living standards of the Japanese people be determined? Article 11 of the Potsdam Declaration stipulates: "Japan shall maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war." The "economy" that is "to be sustained" here, according to the interpretation of the U.S. Preliminary Post-Surrender Policy for Japan on September 26, 1945, is a "peaceful Japanese economy"; according to the statement of U.S. President's Special Envoy for Reparations Edwin W. Pauley, it is "the lowest possible minimum useful Japanese economy." This minimum peaceful economy is the living standard that Japan is to maintain. Pauley also explained: "Not higher than the living standards of the countries Japan has invaded." This means that Japan's living standards should not be higher than those of other Asian countries. Based on this theory, Pauley released his Japanese reparations plan on December 7, 1945. According to Pauley, the Japanese industrial standards represented by this plan are based on Japan's living standards from 1926 to 1930. However, U.S. officials disagreed with Pauley's plan; unexpectedly, this April, the Far Eastern Commission unexpectedly passed the Strike Plan, "retaining the industries necessary to maintain its 1930-1934 living standards, and not completely dismantling them for reparations." Strike is a core figure in the anti-reparations theory, and his claims are naturally different from Pauley's. His claims naturally condone Japan and are detrimental to the Allies; therefore, Chinese public opinion opposes the Far Eastern Commission's decision most strongly. Judging from the current public opinion of various countries, the Far Eastern Commission's blueprint will hardly be established in the peace treaty with Japan.

China has the right to express its opinions on this issue. Now that the world is focusing on the economic clauses of the peace treaty with Japan, it is time for us to put forward a counter-proposal. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has returned from the United States and Japan and has made many speeches on the peace treaty with Japan, focusing only on procedural issues and arguing about whether the Soviet Union should participate, but in essence, he avoids discussing economic clauses; only the Political Consultative Conference and civil organizations, as well as industrial communities in various places, are truly paying attention to this issue. When the Asian Regional Preparatory Conference of the International Labour Organization was held, our representative Wu Yunfu put forward the issue of determining Japan's industrial standards, which immediately received enthusiastic support from Asian countries, especially indicating that this issue is related to the survival of the people of all Asian countries and the life of the industry of all Asian countries, and it must not be ambiguous, followed, and allowed to pass. Now the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are paying attention to this issue and are humbly seeking opinions from all parties, which is a very important measure, but unfortunately, our diplomatic authorities do not seem to pay much attention to it. We would like to provide two opinions on this issue:

(1) In accordance with the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, Japan's economy should be maintained as an economy for peaceful living. What year and period should be used as the baseline for the required living standards cannot be judged rashly or proposed casually. Experts should calculate the conclusion using scientific methods. Pauley's proposal is worthy of serious reference; Strike's proposal should not be emphasized; the proposals of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are especially self-serving and harmful to others, and we must not be tempted by them.

(2) After the baseline for maintaining Japan's livelihood has been determined, the industrial standards that Japan should retain in the future should be determined. Existing military and quasi-military industries should be dismantled for reparations and destroyed. The zaibatsu must be thoroughly dissolved; because the Japanese zaibatsu harbor aggression, they are a threat to the industrial survival of Asian countries.

The above two points should be China's minimum demands. Concrete countermeasures can only be formed based on this principle. What we are demanding is the defensive measures taken by industrially backward countries against a country with latent aggression: what we are demanding is that Japan be maintained at a reasonable industrial standard, which can internally adapt to the people's reasonable living standards and externally ensure that all Asian countries no longer have to worry about being invaded and suffering from poverty. We not only have no intention of enslaving the Japanese people, but also are willing to help the Japanese economy move towards democratization.

### Inspection of Japanese Wartime Looting

(Continued from Page 1) According to the inspection report of our country's representatives, the items stored in the Tokyo World Warehouse are all automobiles, and most of them are not marked with the looted areas. Warehouses 3 and 5 have a large number of items, among which the items marked as looted from our country include Shanghai cloth, books from Nankai and other schools, iron boxes from the Ministry of Transportation, and many letters. The items listed as looted in the Kyoto Museum are mostly antiques and fragments unearthed from Zhangjiakou. The items stored in Fukuoka, some of which are marked as looted from our country, are mostly machines and antiques. The Osaka warehouse has our country's copper coins, nickel coins, antiques, and machines. Among the machines, the storage volume of electric motors and other items is very large. The items stored in Nagoya are copper coins and countless waste copper and scrap iron, including many incense burners, candlesticks, and bronze statues. Regarding the application for the return of looted items, the Reparations Committee had repeatedly sent telegrams to the provincial and municipal governments, informing the looted parties to fill out the prescribed forms, submit relevant certificates, and send them to the local provincial and municipal governments or competent ministries and commissions to forward them to the committee for negotiation on return. This matter is being actively handled. The committee urgently hopes that the owners of the looted items will pay special attention. Those who have not reported or have reported but have incomplete certificates must handle them quickly. If there are any unclear points regarding the handling procedures, they can consult the local provincial and municipal governments, or consult the committee's letter No. 1058, Jing 362, to the provincial and municipal governments on June 7 of this year, explaining the form for requesting the return of enemy-looted materials, the method of filling in the form, and the forms to be prepared, and filling them out accordingly. The person in charge also stated: The looted items that our country has already returned include: (1) Six ships, including Yixian, Xing'an, Hexing, and Heshun, have been transported back to the country one after another.

### Yongli Company's Alkali Plant Produces 80-90 Tons of Alkali per Day, Less Than Half of Pre-war Production

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 16th] The Yongli Chemical Company's Tanggu plant is the only alkali plant in our country. It can now only produce 80-90 tons per day, less than half of its pre-war production. This is because the plant was forcibly occupied and operated by the Japanese during the occupation period, and their inferior technology caused great damage to all the machines. According to Li Zhuchen, before the war, our country needed about 120,000 tons of alkali per year, half of which was Yongli's products, and the rest was imported from the United Kingdom. After the victory, the domestic chemical industry has become more developed than before, and the national annual demand for alkali has reached 200,000 tons, while Yongli's production is less than 70,000 tons. British products are limited by transportation and cannot be imported, so the chemical industry is facing great difficulties. Li said: North China is rich in salt and is most suitable for setting up alkali plants. Therefore, he advocates that the Japanese alkali plants should still be dismantled and transported here to solve our country's alkali shortage.

### India's Printing and Weaving Products are Not Self-sufficient, Tian Heqing Talks About His Return from India

[Our newspaper] The recent political and economic situation in India should be of concern to the people of the country. According to industrialist Tian Heqing, who has just returned from India, he took the time to study the textile industry in India when he was in India. It currently has 10 million spindles, but some equipment is very old, and the efficiency of workers is not as high as in our country. India produces a lot of raw cotton, but due to various reasons, the quality needs to be improved. The output of Indian textiles is not self-sufficient. Currently, there is a system of rationing cotton cloth in major cities, and citizens line up to receive it. Therefore, Indian yarn and cloth will never be sold to our country's market in a considerable period of time, and even Southeast Asia, which is close at hand, has no intention of inquiring. However, India has determined a construction plan for the textile industry and other major industries. If the situation is peaceful, it is expected to improve. In terms of the current political situation in India, the two sides are fighting each other for the princely states, and bloody conflicts are endless. When he arrived in India, the passenger planes were often delayed, which can also reflect the tension of the situation. In the Indian civil strife, external forces are also involved, especially in the northwestern border area, which shows that it has an international background. The British seem to have withdrawn from India on the surface, but they still have control in terms of economy and even military affairs, and everything is directed behind the scenes.

### US Congressional Special Session Opens; Truman Set to Deliver Message Tonight on Domestic Economic Issues, Fierce Debate Expected

[United Press Washington, 16th] Members of Congress are returning to Washington today in droves, preparing for the special session tomorrow to discuss aid and price increase prevention matters. The special session is about seven weeks earlier than the regular session. At 6:30 PM standard time today (2:30 AM Tuesday Shanghai time), both houses of Congress will hold a joint meeting in the House of Representatives chamber to hear President Truman personally deliver a special message to Congress. The $597 million emergency aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria has been submitted by Secretary of State Marshall, and the relevant committees of both houses have been deliberating on it in detail for a week. The content of Truman's message on how to prevent the threat of domestic inflation is still unknown to the outside world. There seems to be a serious conflict between the long-term aid to Europe plan and the domestic price issue. The long-term European recovery bill will not be formally submitted to the two houses of Congress for discussion until the regular session in January next year. Marshall's request that Congress pass the emergency aid bill by the end of the month is described by some members as mandatory. The government hopes that the foreign aid bill can be discussed from a bipartisan or non-partisan standpoint, but the discussion of domestic economic issues will inevitably have a political flavor. With less than a year until the next election, the Democratic and Republican parties will certainly seize the opportunity to attribute the blame for price increases to the other side, in the hope of gaining the support of the electorate. Both the President and Congressional leaders are striving to focus the special session on discussing the two topics at hand, and avoid side issues, such as the tax cut bill, which has been decided to be postponed until the regular session for discussion.

[Reuters Washington, 16th] President Truman's anti-inflation plan has not yet been announced. Well-informed sources predict that the plan will include the following points: (1) Government control over the sourcing and distribution of scarce and valuable materials needed for foreign aid, such as steel, nitrogen fertilizers, and possibly wheat; (2) Restrictions on lending and restoration of controls on installment payment purchase systems; (3) Increased controls to prevent speculation in basic commodities, such as wheat and other food grains; (4) Extension of export controls. In addition, Truman will emphasize his views on the tax system. He will strongly oppose tax cuts to prevent inflation and will recommend that aid to Europe be paid for with tax revenues.

[United Press Washington, 16th] Diplomatic officials announced today that President Truman plans to request that Congress stipulate that at least $6 billion be used to procure materials from Latin America and Canada in any long-term aid to Europe plan in order to reduce the consumption of US resources.

### Stimson Calls for Aid to Europe, States Aid to Europe Not Aimed at Anti-Sovietism; Mobilizes Public to Support Marshall Plan

[Central News Agency New York, 15th] Former US Secretary of War Stimson today called for accelerated aid to European countries threatened by communism. In his statement announcing the establishment of the non-partisan committee for the Marshall Plan Aid to Europe (Stimson as Chairman), Stimson declared! The US aid to Europe policy is not an anti-Soviet policy, but a good neighborly act of wishing to help people in distress. Stimson believes that the threat of communism to European countries is purely due to the hunger and panic caused by the consequences of the war launched by the Nazis. He said, "I believe we should take action quickly. The penalty for delay is to increase the difficulty of the work." Under the committee led by Stimson, an executive committee (chaired by former Secretary of War Patterson) and a national conference will be established, with members including more than 200 leaders from industry, commerce, religion, and education. They will launch a signature campaign of one million people to request Congress to approve the Marshall Plan.

### British Foreign Secretary Praises Marshall Plan

[Reuters England, Bristol, 15th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in a speech at a union commemoration festival in Belgium, expressed regret that not all European countries were able to participate in the Paris conference to discuss the Marshall Plan. He also said, "During my tenure as Foreign Secretary, I will never be a part of maintaining the chaotic state of the world if others are unwilling to agree." He continued, "The United States will do its best to help European countries engage in mutual assistance. The United States does not want to rule Europe, but to hold European countries accountable. This is also what I am eager to do to enable British coal to form an agreement with Denmark tomorrow to order meat, eggs, and butter. I do not pay attention to others' criticism of me. If we want to solve world problems based on today's general theories, such as communism against capitalism, or so-and-so-ism against so-and-so-ism, we will never be able to solve them, but will cause more disputes. I hope the United States can rise up and seize this opportunity, and I will do my best to cooperate with the United States to end the current plight of Europe."

### US Authorities Consider Banning Communist Party

[Reuters Washington, 15th] Observers believe that the recent trend in the United States will cause the US Supreme Court to consider the fate of the American Communist Party and the rights of US military personnel under the Bill of Rights in the next few days. The current investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee into Communist activities in Hollywood is intended to gain public support for two bills that the committee will consider in the next regular session of Congress: one, proposed by Republican Congressman Mundt, stipulates that personnel of any organization ruled or controlled by the Communist Party must register with the authorities in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act; the other, proposed by Democratic Congressman Rankin, stipulates that strict restrictions be placed on the political activities of the Communist Party, such as Communists not being allowed to serve as state or federal civil servants or teachers in public or private schools, not being allowed to disseminate or express sympathy for communism, and those attempting to disseminate pro-Communist publications through the US Postal Service being subject to a fine of up to 10,000 yuan, or imprisonment for up to 10 years.

### US Public Opinion Poll Shows Majority Favors Hardline Stance Against USSR

[United Press New York, 15th] The latest results from the Gallup poll show that although Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has hinted that the Soviet Union also has atomic bombs, the American people still advocate a tough policy toward the Soviet Union. The poll implied that the Soviet Union also possesses this terrible weapon, but the number of people advocating a more lenient approach toward the Soviet Union has not increased significantly. "World Intelligence" magazine reports that war is widely discussed in the United States, which has greatly alarmed Washington.

### Suspects Arrested in Assassination of Former King Case

Of the seven people arrested, one was the former King's secretary, two were palace attendants, and four were kitchen workers. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhong Hao stated that there is solid evidence proving that the late King was poisoned.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Not Optimistic; British Foreign Secretary Bevin Issues Appeal to Stabilize the Situation and Not Miss the Last Opportunity

[Reuters London, 16th] The US government's preparation to submit an aid to Europe plan to Congress and the upcoming discussion of the German issue at the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference have become more closely linked. The proximity of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has made the US government's handling of the aid to Europe plan even more urgent.

However, after reading the recommendations in the Harriman Committee report regarding the German section, one cannot help but feel that if this recommendation is fully adopted, the hope of German economic unification will inevitably fade. The proposal by US Republican foreign policy expert Dulles that if the Soviet Union refuses to sign a four-power, forty-year treaty to prevent German re-aggression, then the UK, the US, and France should proceed with the conclusion of this treaty is nothing short of a shocking suggestion. Although Dulles does not hold an official position, his suggestion to transform the guarantee to prevent German re-aggression into a type of agreement close to an anti-communist pact can show the American public's impatience with the long-delayed German issue. Some people have definite expectations that the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference will inevitably fail, and the division of Germany is inevitable.

[United Press Bristol, 15th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in a speech here tonight that the upcoming four-country foreign ministers' conference will be the last chance to reach an agreement. It is hoped that the conference will consider the fundamental facts of Europe. We should be rational and not panic. If we want to stabilize the world situation based on existing ideals (such as communism versus capitalism), we cannot stabilize it, but only cause greater chaos.

### Unrest Continues Throughout Italy

### French President Summons Leaders of Various Political Parties for Banquet; To Form a Centrist Government and Strive to Block Attacks from Both Left and Right Wings

[Reuters Paris, 15th] The French centrist party leaders originally scheduled to have dinner tonight to discuss ways to solve the current political and economic difficulties, but suddenly announced a postponement, changed to President Auriol hosting a banquet for the leaders of the Socialist Party, People's Republican Party, Radical Party, and Independent Conservative Party on the 16th, and holding talks.

Related parties believe that this talk is an attempt to form a strong government of various centrist parties through agreement to resolve. Tomorrow's luncheon will be held at the President's residence in Rambouillet, near Paris. The participants are expected to include Foreign Minister Bidault, Minister of War Teitgen, Finance Minister Schuman (leader of the People's Republican Party), Prime Minister Ramadier, former Prime Minister and left-wing leader Mollet (above are from the Socialist Party), and National Assembly Speaker Herriot (Radical Party), and former Prime Minister Reynaud (leader of the Independent Conservative Party). Political figures believe that this luncheon is the highest point of behind-the-scenes activities by centrist parties since the Ramadier government obtained a vote of confidence on October 28. The purpose of this activity is to form a strong centrist government to resist the offensive of the extreme right-wing Gaullists and the extreme left-wing Communist Party. The initiator of this plan is Socialist Party elder Blum, who informed Socialist Party leaders that if the centrists fail and de Gaulle seizes power, the republican regime will be declared dead. The Communist Party is also sparing no effort in attacking the "third force" formed by the centrists.

Some people who support the government are gradually feeling uneasy about the possible consequences of the incident that caused Dalton's resignation, and even feel that it may cause cracks within the Labor Party.

### Yoshida and Shidehara Reach Agreement, Current Cabinet Facing Crisis, Ashida Expresses Lack of Support for Katayama

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Authoritative sources reveal: Yoshida and Shidehara reached a complete agreement on the 14th during their meeting to discuss the formation of a new conservative party. It is rumored that the Democratic Party's internal split will be triggered by the issue of coal mine nationalization, but the driving force behind the scenes is the movement to establish a new conservative party.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The first session of the Japanese Diet is facing another week's delay due to disputes over the coal mine nationalization bill. The reason given is that the government and party's amendment proposals cannot be submitted to the House of Representatives' Committee on Industry and Mining within the next two to three days due to conflicting opinions between the Socialist and Democratic parties. Furthermore, the House of Councillors has stated that if the bill is not delivered to the House of Councillors by the 15th, it will not be responsible for passing it by the designated date. However, the Liberal Party is strongly opposed to any further extension of the Diet session. Therefore, dark clouds are gathering over the Katayama cabinet.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Democratic Party President Ashida, while en route to attending the Democratic Party congress in Yamagata Prefecture, stated in a speech in Fukushima on the 16th: It is rumored that the Democratic Party may split due to the coal mine nationalization bill, but I do not believe this will happen. Perhaps only two or three members of the Industry and Mining Committee who absolutely oppose the bill will leave the party. As for the peace conference issue, it should be handled by a cabinet that enjoys the deep trust of the people. I do not believe in the so-called notion that the current Katayama cabinet is indispensable. Furthermore, the selection of the Japanese plenipotentiary to be sent to the peace conference has not yet been determined.

### Next UN General Assembly Meeting Decided to be Held in Europe

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 15th] The United Nations General Assembly decided today, by a vote of 32 to 17, with 5 abstentions, to hold its meeting next year in Europe. The city where the meeting will be held is yet to be decided by a special nine-member committee. Previously, China and the United Kingdom strongly opposed the relocation, arguing that it would cost the United Nations millions of dollars and put the world organization in some procedural difficulties. Since a two-thirds majority is required to increase the budget, and today's decision was passed by only a simple majority, the 17 countries that voted against it may block the necessary expenses for the proposed relocation next year.

### The Korean Impasse

— By W. L. Chenery, Publisher of American Collier's Weekly, Specially Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper

If we can find a way to withdraw from Korea without the Soviet Union taking advantage of it, we would gladly leave Korea quickly.

The American military sentry post on the 38th parallel in Korea is perhaps the loneliest place in all the occupied territories. At the beginning of the occupation, the Soviet sentry posts were quite close to ours, and sometimes the soldiers talked to each other in a fairly amicable manner. But those days are gone. Currently, both sides have moved their sentries back to avoid accidents. Next to the railway tracks, there are signs warning people not to stray into the wrong zone, because if we are not careful and wander from the American-occupied zone into the Soviet-occupied zone, we risk being shot.

In the past two years, Americans have had one opportunity to go to the Soviet-occupied zone of Korea. In April of this year, twenty-three soldiers and six officers of the US 7th Infantry Division worked with Soviet personnel to survey the 38th parallel. They worked and lived with the Soviets for several days, and each person recorded what they saw and heard. The Soviet side did not create a collective report, so it was not published, but I (the author) happened to obtain a copy, which contains the following:

Equipment—The individual weapons provided to the Soviet soldiers were well-maintained and of good quality, but very old. The cars had been repaired repeatedly. Almost all of the vehicles seen in the Soviet zone were American-made, acquired by the Soviet army during the war under the Lend-Lease agreement. The people using these vehicles seemed to lack both resources and knowledge to keep them in good condition. The jeep used by the Soviet personnel in the survey team repeatedly broke down.

Clothing—The clothing worn by the Soviet soldiers was of different styles, insufficient in quantity, and worn out. Most of their uniforms were made of good material, but were too old and dirty. Most of the Soviets did not wear socks, and before putting on their leather boots, they wrapped rags around their feet. The boots were also so old that they were almost unusable. On one occasion, the Soviet personnel stayed overnight in the American zone south of the 38th parallel, and many Soviets refused to shower because they said they had no underwear to change into and therefore could not maintain personal hygiene.

Living conditions—The senior personnel in the survey team at best slept on simple iron beds with straw mats, but most Soviet soldiers slept on the floor, and the mattresses were very dirty. There were no bathing facilities, only stream water and well water. Soviet soldiers used the water they could find nearby for bathing and drinking without any cleaning.

Food—The officers and soldiers of the 7th Division ate well when they lived with the Soviets. Most of them believed that because the Soviet soldiers were quite healthy, they must have good food, but some facts showed that most of their food was supplied locally.

Morale and discipline—Most of the soldiers in the 7th Division thought that the morale of the Soviet soldiers seemed quite high. The people serving were young, but very few had combat experience. They seemed quite happy, but like most American soldiers, they talked mostly about home and everyone seemed to want to leave Korea and return to the Soviet Union.

It is generally believed that the Soviet soldiers are well-trained. Perhaps more so than us. Although the Soviet service personnel are young, most of them joined the military early; they have served in the military for a longer time than American soldiers of the same age.

The Soviets have already organized a Korean army of about 150,000 to 200,000 men in northern Korea. In the American-occupied zone, the army has not been organized. Although General Hodge has trained a small police force, numbering only 28,000 men. Therefore, the Soviet Union can send this Korean army south at any time and establish a communist government throughout Korea. If this really happens, General Hodge does not have enough troops to prevent its invasion.

If the Soviet Union decides to order the Koreans to attack south, the American army can only retreat as quickly as possible, but the problem does not end there. The Soviet Union can occupy Korea, but currently the Soviet Union cannot occupy Japan. The Japanese believe that the Soviet Union is eyeing Japan's land, resources, and manpower. This is the basic reason why Japan hopes the United States will continue to occupy Japan for a long time.

We remain in Korea, undertaking a troublesome and dangerous task, which is to prevent communism from spreading to other parts of the world. If we can find a way to withdraw from Korea without the Soviet Union taking advantage of it, we would gladly leave Korea quickly.

The Koreans do not want us to leave, but we always hope to leave immediately when we can. The question is also how we can negotiate a solution with Japan and, to some extent, with China. What kind of defense can we build in the Far East Pacific region? This question has a decisive effect on our own future and how long we will remain in Korea.

### Difficult to Implement Demolition of Houses on Tianmu Road, Residents Willing to Live and Die with Houses, Senator Requests Six-Month Postponement

The first phase of the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road for road widening, as stipulated by the Public Works Bureau, requires the prior demolition of 14 houses obstructing the road alignment. This morning, a special commissioner from the bureau went to enforce the demolition accompanied by the police. However, the residents of these 14 houses still refused to move, and declared that they were willing to live and die with their houses, leading to a stalemate and making enforcement impossible. The head of the North Station Police Sub-bureau, Ying Zhichun, fearing accidents, came forward to persuade the residents, but to no avail. He then asked the Public Works Bureau to postpone the enforcement for one day and ordered the residents to move out important items immediately.

Furthermore: Senator Tao Baichuan visited Speaker Pan yesterday to plead on behalf of the residents in the area, requesting a postponement of six months. Mr. Pan immediately telegraphed Mayor Wu, requesting his approval. However, the Mayor stated that he could not retract this decision. According to Mr. Pan: Delaying the demolition of these 14 houses until the beginning of next year would not seem to cause much harm, allowing the residents to get through the New Year.

### Preparatory Meeting of Asian Labor Conference Concludes

Tian Heqing Returns to Shanghai to Discuss Meeting Proceedings

[This Newspaper] The preparatory meeting of the Asian Labor Conference was held at the National Congress Hall in New Delhi, India, from its opening on October 27 to its conclusion on November 8. Of the Chinese delegates, Bao Huaguo flew to Chongqing, Wu Yunxu remained in Hong Kong, and the remaining delegates, including Tian Heqing, returned to Shanghai on the 14th. Mr. Tian spoke in detail with reporters yesterday about the proceedings of the meeting, stating: The nature of this preparatory meeting was to discuss and prepare the issues to be raised at the first Asian Labor Conference to be held in China in 1949. The main purpose was to find ways to ensure the livelihoods of workers, increase worker income, and develop industry and stabilize the economy. All Far Eastern countries except Japan, Korea, and Indonesia sent representatives to participate. A total of more than 30 proposals were discussed at the congress, with India submitting the most. China submitted nine proposals, including one concerning limiting the industrial development of Japan so that it could no longer harm other Asian countries with its dumping policies, which was passed by the congress after repeated discussions.

All Proposals Categorized into Four Groups

All proposals were categorized by the congress into four groups: Program of Action Group, on minimum wage, working hours, night work for female workers, etc., on how to implement the regulations of the International Labor Bureau in Asia, where industrial standards are far from those of Europe. Social Security Group, on social insurance, worker income security, medical and health implementation, etc., recommendations. Labor Policy Group, including technical training, worker employment, elimination of subcontracting systems, treatment of female and child labor, worker housing, cooperative enterprises, etc., suggestions. General Review and Recommendations, on how to develop the Asian economy, improve production technology, and transfer surplus rural populations to industrial production, etc. All proposals passed will be submitted to the International Labor Bureau to organize investigation teams and research teams to investigate facts based on principles and reach conclusions, which will be discussed in detail at the first congress in two years.

Sharp Opposition Between Labor and Management Representatives

Mr. Tian also said: At this preparatory meeting, the opposition between labor and management representatives was very sharp, with government representatives acting as mediators. Before each general meeting, labor and management each had small group meetings to unify the opinions of representatives from various countries and take concerted action. Even so, this method of having government, labor, and management jointly discuss issues is still the best way to resolve labor disputes. Mr. Tian and others also visited Nehru and Gandhi during their trip. Nehru's complexion was very fair, while Gandhi was not emaciated but had an excellent physique. Even at the age of seventy-eight, one could not see a single rib on his chest. Therefore, the delegation had a humorous saying: "Nehru is not black, Gandhi is not dry," which was also an interesting anecdote of the trip.

### Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall Fully Stocked with Domestic Products

### Air Freight Business Increases Sharply, Tenfold Increase Since August

Domestic civil aviation has developed significantly in two years, especially between January and August of this year, with several-fold increases in war goods, mail, and passengers. According to the person in charge of China National Aviation Corporation: The reason for this sharp increase is that land and water transportation are frequently disrupted by communist sabotage, while air transport is safer and faster than land transport. As a result, freight, passenger transport, and mail are all shifting to air transport, resulting in a sharp increase in business. According to the company's business report, freight volume in August increased tenfold compared to January, passenger traffic increased threefold, and mail increased twofold. It is also expected that air transport will become even busier in the future due to the popularization of civil aviation. Therefore, both civil aviation companies have plans to purchase new aircraft or increase the number of flight routes.

### Conservation Campaign Takes Effect, Power Supply Situation Improves

According to the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, the city's power supply situation has indeed improved for three reasons: The cost of living has risen, worker salaries have increased, and work efficiency has improved. The conservation campaign has been effective. Factories with generators have successively generated their own electricity and supplied half of their power to other factories. However, every winter, the demand for electric heating increases sharply, causing power shortages. In addition to making every effort to increase supply, it is hoped that citizens will conserve electricity in order to safely get through this severe period of power shortages.

They said that most of them are public educators and family members of soldiers who fought in the war who came to Shanghai after many hardships and have no relatives to turn to. Now, due to the communist rebellion, they have no home to return to and their lives are in dire straits. They appealed to society for sympathy and requested three months' worth of severance pay based on the cost of living in Xinjin.

Before long, the car arrived at the entrance of the headquarters. One man got out and went inside, then came out and falsely claimed that he had received an order from the section chief to take them to the Jiangwan Headquarters.

He was taken to the bureau for questioning and was found to have a note that read: "This child is the young owner of the Xinshengshun Suitcase Store at No. 14 Kangjia Lane, Xiaodongmen. Kindly deliver him to his home."

After repeated questioning, he confessed the truth. He claimed his name was Jin Wenbin and that he was a neighbor of the aforementioned Xinshengshun Suitcase Store and knew they were wealthy. On the evening of October 19th, at 8:00 PM, he went to the store under the pretext of buying candy and took the opportunity to hide the store owner's three-year-old son, Tang Xiaomin, without a trace. He then sent letters to the store owner's wife three times, stating that Xiaomin was in Chongming and was in good health, and that he was borrowing 500 million yuan for his team's use, otherwise there would be danger. If they wanted to redeem the boy, they could write a letter on the 18th and place it under the Zhongshan Bridge at the Zhaofeng Garden train pier under a broken coffin near a Pepsodent toothpaste advertisement sign, and they would receive it. Based on his confession, Section Chief Jiang, along with officers Tang Zhiliang, Sun Zhiming, Liu Zongtong, Yang Zhongmin, Xu Guizhu, and others, rushed to No. 14 Kangjia Lane, Nanshi, and No. 78 Fanhuangdu Road, and arrested accomplices Cao Renfu, Tian Chengde, and Jiang Zhigao, a letter-splitter who wrote the threatening letters. They also rescued the hostage at Cao Chen Hongying's residence at No. 765, Lane 1032, Sujiajiao, Changning Road, and notified his family to take him back at approximately 8:00 AM.

### Speaker Visits District Governments on the Second Day, Explaining the Understanding of Constitutional Governance

Yesterday was the second day of the Municipal Senate Speaker Pan Gongzhan's visit to various district to inspect implementation. In the morning, he visited the Hongkou District, and in the afternoon, he visited the North Sichuan Road District. At approximately 10:00 AM, Speaker Pan, accompanied by Senator Xia, Director Bu Shenghua of the Senate Secretariat, Director Yang of the Health Bureau, Secretary Lu of the Public Works Bureau, and others, departed for the Hongkou District Government to briefly discuss the district's recent administrative situation and preparations for the general election with the district head and others. Subsequently, a visit to various local offices was held, covering 13 local offices. At each office, the local head gave an oral account of the most important current work.

Speaker Pan carefully considered each report and promised to convey the information to the government for improvement. Subsequently, a group of local leaders and citizens waited at Kunshan Park, and Speaker Pan drove there to meet them. At approximately 2:00 PM in the afternoon, he arrived at the North Sichuan Road District and visited each local office, covering 12 local offices.

Speaker Pan completed his visit to the various local offices at approximately 5:00 PM and then went to Fuxing Middle School to deliver a speech to over a thousand assembled citizens. The topic of the speech was "The Knowledge that Citizens Should Have on the Eve of the General Election." He briefly stated that the responsibilities and behaviors of the people and the government towards the country in the constitutional period are different from those in the period of political tutelage. Therefore, on the eve of the general election, it is first necessary to have a clear understanding of the evolution of the national political system. In the constitutional period, the people should have the following understandings: 1) To transform from the previous "governed" to the new era of "self-governance." All citizens are the masters of the country, with equal rights and obligations. 2) To transform from the previous "monarchy" or "officialdom" to the new era of "democracy," creating public opinion politics, where everything depends on the parliament, and breaking the stubborn idea of "common people do not discuss politics." 3) To transform from the previous "rule of man" or "rule of virtue" to the new era of "rule of law," giving absolute authority to the law, so that officials in the legislative, judicial, or administrative branches, like the people, must abide by the law. 4) To transform from the previous monarchy or government holding the four major powers of "life and death," to the new era where the people hold the four major powers of "election, recall, initiative, and referendum," gradually creating a situation where the people have power. 5) To transform from the previous "each sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, regardless of the frost on others' roofs" principle of "taking care of oneself," to the "seeking broad shelter for all the world's poor" principle of "benefiting the world," where the people use methods of electing capable individuals to directly or indirectly manage the affairs of the public. Finally, Speaker Pan stated that he is also a candidate for the National Assembly representative and hopes that citizens will use their conscience and discernment to support his candidacy for the National Assembly representative so that he can contribute his abilities and intelligence to represent his compatriots and promote the realization of national democracy and the rule of law.

Speaker Pan is scheduled to visit the Yimiao District this morning and the Xuhui District this afternoon. He may also meet with some of the local leaders and district citizen representatives from the Fahua District to consult on local conditions. At 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM, he will give campaign speeches at the Penglai Grand Theater and the Guangfu Temple Square on Fangbang Road, respectively. The topic of his speeches will be "The Nanshi after the War," and it is expected that many citizens of Shanghai South will attend.

In this past year, everything I have done has been to serve the citizens and assist Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan in seeking stability for Shanghai. I believe I have done my best for the people. I have been serving the people of Shanghai from the Party's perspective for over a year, and now I hope to be able to further represent the people and speak for them at the National Assembly, implement the people's demands, and serve the people to the end. Therefore, I am running for the National Assembly in Shanghai and asking for everyone's help. I believe that being elected as a National Assembly representative does not represent myself but represents the citizens of Shanghai. A successful campaign is not a personal victory but the glory of everyone. Your vote for me is equivalent to voting for yourself. After being elected, I am determined to maintain my past style and do my best to serve the people. I hope that everyone will use their conscience to judge, rely on their sense of justice, and vote for me." The speech lasted for nearly 20 minutes, and the audience felt excited.

Li Chonghu, a Candidate for the National Assembly from the Women's Community in Jiangsu Province, Expresses Her Campaign Views

Our reporter recently interviewed Ms. Li Chonghu, a candidate for the National Assembly representing women's groups in Jiangsu Province. She briefly stated her campaign views, saying: Regarding the matter of gender equality, she believes that men and women should have equal opportunities to develop their talents and interests freely and should not be forcibly bound by artificial systems. As for women's education, the first priority is to eliminate illiteracy, which is the most active task that should be carried out nationwide. Secondly, the government and various social organizations should actively promote and widely establish women's factories, women's stores, etc., so that women without families or those who are unemployed can have work to do. Finally, regarding the popularization of children's welfare throughout the country, she believes that this is an urgent matter that requires government assistance and the organization of knowledgeable women to strengthen publicity. If all women in the country can universally obtain the minimum amount of knowledge about childcare and hygiene, it will definitely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Ms. Li is the eldest daughter of the late famous Jiangsu educator Li Gengsheng. Early in life, she followed in her father's footsteps and engaged in educational work. At the age of twenty, she served as the principal of Huaiyin Women's Elementary School, and later taught at Haizhou Middle School, Yangzhou Middle School, Zhenjiang Normal School, and other schools for more than ten years. When she married Zhao Di, she donated the money spent on her wedding to establish Chonghua Elementary School in Zhenjiang. During the Anti-Japanese War, she moved to Jiangxi and led the Third War Zone Women's Work Team to rescue children and establish refugee factories.

### Survey of the Central Section of the Jinpu Railway: The Yanzhou-Jinan Section Urgently Needs to Open to Traffic

[Jinan, 13th (Airmail)] News came yesterday that the track-laying project for the Yanzhou-Jinan section being undertaken by the Jinpu Railway Administration has been suspended for three days due to a shortage of railroad ties. According to related sources, all 164 kilometers of the Yanzhou-Jinan section that were damaged have had their earthwork completed, totaling 370,000 cubic meters. Of the 360 large and small bridges, 340 have been completed. Only 20 small bridges and 30 kilometers of road surface are delayed due to a shortage of

70,000 Railroad Ties

resulting in the halt of work pending supplies. For this reason, this reporter feels compelled to issue the most urgent appeal to the Ministry of Communications on behalf of the 38 million people of Shandong. At the same time, in order to understand the actual situation of the emergency repair project, I had to brave the northern cold and travel along the railway from Jinan to Tai'an amidst a sea of yellow sand to conduct an on-site survey of the northern section of the Yanzhou-Jinan section in the central section of the Jinpu Railway.

On the morning of the 13th, when the car passed Chaomidian, with the explanation of Section Chief Song Jianfang of the Road Bureau's Engineering Department, who was traveling with me, it was discovered that the seven-kilometer road surface from Chaomidian to Gangshan had only four to six railroad ties filled in for every ten-meter-long rail due to a shortage of ties, which was barely passable by

Light Motor Vehicles

In fact, according to the prescribed standard, fourteen to fifteen railroad ties should be filled in for every ten-meter-long rail in order to allow special express trains to run. Currently, due to the shortage of railroad ties, all of the Yanzhou-Jinan section has been uniformly changed to twelve railroad ties per rail. Therefore, only slow trains and ordinary express trains can run. When the situation improves in the future, if special express trains are to be restored, this section with the short-filled railroad ties will still need to be supplemented.

The 20 kilometers between Gangshan and Wande have not been paved with tracks at all. The original employees, due to the lack of railroad ties, are only continuing to rush to build the

Two Large Bridges

between Tai'an and Jinan, the Shidian River Bridge (5 kilometers south of Zhangxia) and the Wanyu River Bridge (2 kilometers south of Wande). The remaining employees can only be used to tidy up the repaired sections and take on protection work.

According to the bureau's estimate, even with only twelve railroad ties filled in for every ten-meter rail, the 20 kilometers from Wan to Gushan, plus the 7 kilometers from Chaomidian to Gangshan, plus sidings, etc., total no less than 40 kilometers, which requires 48,000 railroad ties. Another 22,000 railroad ties are needed to fill in the 20 small bridges, totaling at least 70,000 railroad ties to complete the opening of the Yanzhou-Jinan section. The main reason is the shortage of railroad ties. Otherwise, there would be no need to wait until the end of the month. The opening of traffic between Jinan and Pukou could be completed by the 20th of this month.

The Ministry of Communications, which is in charge of national railway affairs, reportedly has a considerable amount of railroad ties in storage, but it is said that these materials are intended to be used for the restoration of the Zhegan Line and the Jiangnan Railway. In the Ministry of Communications' opinion, those areas are relatively safe. It is uncertain whether the restored central section of the Jinpu Railway will follow in the footsteps of the Jiaoji Railway and be able to stay open for a long time. However, today, the government's supreme national policy is to prioritize military affairs and suppress rebellion. Therefore, even from a

Purely Military Standpoint

the urgent restoration of the Xuji section is the inescapable responsibility of the department in charge. UNRRA may be able to use the excuse of war to refuse to supply railway materials north of 34 degrees latitude to our country, but the Ministry of Communications cannot completely plan only for the revenue and surplus of its own department and disregard national policy and the lives of the people.

In short, from an objective need, the Yanzhou-Jinan section must be completed and open to traffic by the end of this month at the latest. The wise authorities in charge of the Ministry of Communications naturally would not allow the work to fall short due to a mere 70,000 railroad ties (from the Ministry of Communications' perspective, 70,000 railroad ties are really nothing).

After the

Yanzhou-Jinan Section Opens to Traffic

In the first few periods, in order to ensure the safety of passengers, although night trains will not run on the Xuji section, passengers will need to change trains at both Yanzhou and Xuzhou stations. Therefore, the journey from Pukou to Jinan, which used to take only 15 hours before the war, now requires a day and two nights. However, the main income of the railway is not from passenger transport but from freight transport. In the future, large quantities of Shandong's wheat, soybeans, peanuts, cotton, leather, corn, and other agricultural products will be exported. The minimum estimate on the Jinpu Railway Administration's side is that, barring accidents, the monthly income will be between 1.5 trillion and 2 trillion. If the 268 kilometers from Tanggutun south of Tianjin to Sannan Station north of Jinan are also opened and repaired, in other words, after the entire Jinpu Railway is reopened to traffic, its value and significance for domestic military, political, and economic affairs will naturally be even more self-evident.

From the perspective of the people of Shandong, who have been suffocated for nine months, the restoration and opening of the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway is tantamount to regaining freedom and light. (Special Correspondent Litian of this newspaper)

### Dispute Arises During River Crossing: Students from Yuanzhong School Injure Wang Zhibin; School Promises to Expel the Offending Students

[Hengyang, 16th (Telegram)] Wang Zhibin, the Commissioner of the Ninth District of Yuanling, was returning from the office across the river into the city at dusk on the 10th. He asked his guards to return to the office to retrieve a flashlight. Some students from Yuanzhong School also wanted to cross the river and tried to squeeze into Wang's boat. Wang reprimanded them, and the students refused to comply, leading to a conflict. Wang raised his hand and slapped a student. The students, being numerous, fought back, throwing Wang's hat into the river and injuring him, causing his nose to bleed. Wang hurriedly returned to the office and led his guards to the scene, but the students had dispersed. He ordered the school to hand over the offending students. It is reported that the school has agreed to expel the students.

### Taiwan Provincial Forestry Administration Plans to Build 300 New Villages

[Taipei, 15th (Airmail)] In order to solve the housing shortage in Taipei and help alleviate unemployment, the Provincial Forestry Products Administration has submitted a proposal to the Provincial Government to start building "Forestry Products New Villages" from December. According to Director Tang Zhenxu of the Administration, the new villages will be divided into three types: "Qing" (Integrity), "Shen" (Caution), and "Qin" (Diligence) (the Administration's motto), based on their size. The plan is to build 80 "Qing" houses, 100 "Shen" houses, and 120 "Qin" houses, in three phases. Each phase will take three months. After the completion of the first phase of houses, they will be sold to public school teachers and civil servants. The proceeds will then be used to proceed with the second phase of construction. The location is currently being selected and will cover approximately 120 ping (396 square meters). Regarding the problem of railroad tie supply in this province, it has recently been uniformly handled by the Administration. The supply targets have been specified as the Ministry of Communications, the Provincial Railway Management Committee, and the Sugar Corporation. However, due to the excessive demand, totaling approximately 1.6 million ties, while the estimated production of railroad ties by the province's various forestry areas, the mountain forestry management offices under the jurisdiction of the Agricultural and Forestry Department, and the model forestry areas from October to the end of this year is only over 340,000, the supply falls far short of the demand.

### Wujiang Strictly Pursues Shen Xuesheng and Others

[Wujiang, 15th (News)] Communist bandits are hiding in the Taihu Lake area, colluding with local thugs, and secretly carrying out activities. Shen Xuesheng, a native of Xigang in this county, has recently been incited by the Communist bandits to gather more than ten bandits and plot wrongdoing. A few days ago, he conspired with Gu Guohua, the platoon leader of the Pudong Township Self-Defense Force, and Zhang Youquan, Lu Yinong, Gu Xiaosong, and Lu Shulin, merchants in the Bachizhen, to invite Wang Youzhu, the squad leader of the town's Self-Defense Force, to drink, attempting to seize the Self-Defense Force's firearms. Fortunately, Wang was deeply aware of the importance of his duty and was not deceived. He secretly reported to Platoon Leader Sheng Jieqing and Mayor Cai Songzhang, who devised a plan to arrest Gu, Zhang, and Lu. The main culprit, Shen Xuesheng, is being pursued. Yesterday, the arrested criminals were escorted to the county government for interrogation, and the authorities were requested to assist in arresting the remaining fugitives.

### Citywide Games Successfully Conclude Lou Wen'ao Stands Out Breaking National 10,000-Meter Record Middle School Gymnastics Group Rankings Determined

[Our Newspaper] The 5th Citywide Games successfully concluded. On the last day yesterday, the results of various competitions were extremely outstanding. In the highly anticipated 10,000-meter final, deaf Lou Wen'ao won first place with a time of 32 minutes and 31.2 seconds. Wang Zhenglin also won the runner-up with a time of 34 minutes. Both broke the national 10,000-meter record of 34 minutes and 1 second. However, the wind was strong at the venue yesterday, so Lou Wen'ao failed to break his own record of 32 minutes and 9.6 seconds, which is a pity. In addition, in the high school boys' 200-meter final, Rong Chengbi of Jizha Middle School approached the national record with 22.8 seconds, which was also one of the satisfactory harvests of yesterday's conference. In terms of team scores: The Municipal Institute of Physical Education for Colleges won the women's championship and the men's runner-up in the college group, with the most points. The men's championship for colleges was won by Dongya Institute of Physical Education. In the middle school section, the men's high school and junior high school championships were evenly divided between Gezhi and Jizha, while Yucai won both runners-up. In the women's group, Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School won the high school championship and the junior high school runner-up, while Minli Girls' Middle School won the junior high school championship and the high school runner-up. In the open group, Zhu Shafei won the individual championship with 16 points. Due to the small number of participants in the group, and Chuang Hongda's abandonment of the shot put, and Wang Xuewu's javelin performance being affected by headwind, the results were inferior. It is said that the awards ceremony for various championships will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium at a later date. After five days of competition among thousands of athletes, this glorious event has come to a successful conclusion, and the conference was declared closed in a cheer. The team scores of each group and the results of yesterday's finals are listed below:

A list of champions in each group

### Taiwan Provincial Sports Delegation Flew Back to Shanghai Yesterday

Reporters Gain Abundant Harvests

The Shanghai reporter Taiwan sports visiting group, organized by the Shanghai Sports Reporters Association, left Shanghai on the Zhongxing Wheel on the 6th of this month. After arriving in Taipei, they stayed for a total of eight days, visiting Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other places, and gained a lot. Except for Wang Weijun, who still needs to stay for two days due to matters, the remaining nine people, led by Zhang Baokui, left Taipei on a China Airlines plane at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. The Director of the Taiwan Provincial Information Office, Lin Ziguan, the Chairman of the Reporters Association, Ye Kaidong, and colleagues from the press all went to the airport to see them off. The plane took off at 11:05 a.m. and arrived at Longhua Airport at 2:00 p.m.

### Fleet-footed Like a Flying Horse Taking the Lead Jade Arms Lightly Extended, Three Firsts in a Row

[Our Newspaper] The most exciting program of yesterday's conference was the 10,000-meter final. Lou Wen'ao lived up to everyone's expectations and broke the national record. Although this man is deaf, he is a brave champion on the track, running faster and faster. His score was 32 minutes and 31.2 seconds. When he reached 5,000 meters, it was 16 minutes and 42 seconds. The entire 25 laps, calculated per lap (about 400 meters), averaged no more than one minute and twenty seconds.

There was a little hero, Wang Youyu, participating in the open group 10,000-meter final. Although he is only 16 years old, it only took him 40 minutes to complete the entire journey. He can be said to have unlimited prospects.

Because Lou Wen'ao is deaf, the referee who calculated the number of laps for him was very troubled. After each lap, the referee signaled with a gesture, but he was afraid that he did not fully understand. In the last lap, he specially used a starting gun in front of his eyes to make a sound first. As a result, the referee was sweating profusely and kept exclaiming, "It's really difficult to deal with a deaf-mute person!"

The conference opened for five days. The red silk curtains on the podium have turned white after being scorched by the sun and wind. The ground is covered with nail marks and holes, and the smell of turpentine oil still floats in the air amid the flying paper scraps.

Yan Jingyu, a female student from the Municipal Institute of Physical Education, participated in three sports and softball competitions, winning three firsts and one third. The key to the Municipal Sports Competition winning the women's championship this time lies in her.

Scout Strike A Disturbance

The order of yesterday's meeting was once slightly disturbed. The podium warned the scouts to take responsibility. As a result, the director of military training of a certain school believed that the reporter's tone contained insults to the scouts. He went on stage to negotiate, and all the scouts were angry and went on strike. It was resolved after mediation. The audience outside the venue was confused by this sudden disturbance.

The most regrettable thing about this city sports meeting is that the open group women's competition was missing. It is said that this is because there were not enough people. Huang Mingyuan and others stood by and watched for days. Seeing the female students on the sandbar, vigorous and colorful, they seemed to reveal the feeling of growing thighs again.

Hao Gengsheng, a senior figure in the sports world and honorary vice president of the City Games, also visited the venue yesterday morning. A message was specially broadcast for him in the microphone, attracting everyone's attention.

During the five days of the conference, a total of 18 cases of lost children being claimed occurred. Every time the announcement was made to claim the children, these children had special markings: a sore on the corner of the mouth, holding a sugarcane in the hand, wearing an air force children's uniform, named "Yueying"...

The reporter in the microphone sometimes spoke in authentic Beijing dialect, with a mellow rhyme, but the pronunciation was not accurate. Once he reported: "High school men and women" 400-meter relay preparation at the same time! Long and slow, the audience who heard it downwind asked each other: What? "Dogs and women"?...

Air Rifting Pleasant and Eye-catching

Jizha Middle School won both the high school and junior high school championships in the 400-meter relay race yesterday, so it played military music and set off firecrackers. The sound of drums and cracks lasted for five minutes, and the air in the venue was tense.

When the competition reached its climax, the cheers and cheers from around the venue continued for a long time. Someone would classify the cheers: the college boys were like wolves howling and apes crying, urgent and powerful; the general audience was like the sound of mine bells and drums, long and heavy; and the female students were like air ripping, sharp and relaxed.

Malayan Chinese Youth Scores First

The captains of both teams exchanged flags, and referee Deng Xiaoliang blew the whistle to start the match. Qing Bai had the wind advantage, and Malayan Chinese Youth kicked off. Xia Tixian led the attack, and after two minutes, Qing Bai counterattacked. Qu Yongfu took a long shot from the 30-yard line, but Zhu Zhicheng caught the rebound. After a chaotic scramble, Xia Tixian, Mei Runhua, and Huang Guodong launched a three-pronged attack. Xia took a shot from distance, but it missed. Three minutes later, Qing Bai launched a full-scale attack, with Gao Xiuqing penetrating deep into the opponent's territory. Jin Lusheng took a powerful shot, but Zhang Guoxing blocked it for a corner kick. Both sides exchanged attacks, but the visiting team looked tired and strained. In the 12th minute, the visiting team's fortunes changed. A dangerous situation arose in front of the Qing Bai goal. Hu Wenxiang took a close-range shot, but Qin Bigao parried it away. Xia Tixian recovered the ball, passed it lightly to the right, and Hu Wenxiang unleashed a powerful shot that found the back of the net, opening the scoring at 1-0. Qing Bai launched a major counterattack, but to no avail. The first half ended with Malayan Chinese Youth leading 1-0.

Qing Bai Equalizes

After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed the match. The visiting team's lineup remained unchanged, while Qing Bai made significant changes. Wu Kaimin's old injury flared up, and Li Yichen was replaced at right back. Luo Shoufu was substituted, and Gu Yisa came on, switching positions with Gao Xiuqing. Ha Zengming took up the left wing position, and Jin Lusheng moved inside. After these adjustments, Qing Bai's forward line consisted entirely of young players, making their attack more potent, while the experienced defenders provided solid cover. In the seventh minute, Jiang Chuangqing advanced down the right flank and sent a long pass into the center. Gao Xiuqing made a clever dummy run, Chen Jiawan missed Jin Lusheng, who took advantage and unleashed a powerful shot. The ball went in beautifully, leaving Zhu Zhicheng stunned. Qing Bai equalized at 1-1. The visiting team's formation became increasingly disjointed. After 15 minutes of chaotic play, Qing Bai intended to substitute Xie Qichuan for Xue Peiran, but the referee disallowed it. In the 25th minute, Jiang Chuangqing left the field due to a leg injury. Two minutes later, the visiting team's Huang Guodong also left the field due to a left arm injury. Both teams were now playing with ten men. Shortly after, Jiang Chuangqing returned to the field. Subsequently, both sides launched attacks, but neither managed to score. As time ran out, the match ended in a 1-1 draw.

### China Supports Legal Proposal to Eliminate Racial Discrimination

Has Been Approved by the UNESCO Program Committee

[United Press, Mexico City, 16th] With the strong support of China and the Philippines, the UNESCO Program and Budget Committee unanimously passed a French proposal calling for the elimination of discrimination based on gender, skin color, and race in educational circles and cultural and educational organizations worldwide. The original proposal was more strongly worded, but South African representative Roberts opposed it, arguing that eliminating racial differences was impractical in countries like South Africa, which has eight or nine million indigenous people, "more than half of whom are still in a primitive stage." Roberts said that South Africa is striving to raise the standards of indigenous people, but in fact, indigenous teachers cannot be given equal opportunities and treatment. The Chinese representative requested that the French proposal be strengthened, as the original proposal did not state "equal pay for equal work."

### Jiang Zhonglin Returns to Shanghai from the United States, Discusses the Current Situation of Fur Trade Import and Export. Development of the Fur Export Industry Should Start with Quality Improvement, 3 Million Yellow Weasel Pelts Were Sold to the US Last Year.

China's fur export figures were quite considerable before the war, but during the war, sea transport was disrupted, and inventory piled up. Since the resumption of foreign trade, exports have surged last year, totaling approximately 20 million yuan in bonuses, mainly to the United States. This year, due to the war affecting production areas and transportation obstructions, foreign sales have declined. Jiang Zhonglin, chairman of the Shanghai Fur, Oil, and Bone Trade Association, flew from Shanghai to the United States on August 9th to conduct on-site inspections, stayed in New York for over two months to promote fur exports and improve tanning, visited major tanning and carpet weaving factories, and established close contacts with leading manufacturers and fashion design experts. Jiang has now returned to Shanghai last Thursday (the 13th) because of the urgent need to handle affairs in Shanghai.

According to Jiang, the previous trip to the United States was purely for private travel, one to contact old customers and the other to visit New York tanneries, study their production methods, and use them as a reference to improve China's fur export business. China's tanning work is adhering to conventions, and its products are difficult to compete with other countries in the international market. For example, China uses rice water as tanning raw material, while they use chemical solutions, and they use machines to make leather, while we rely on workers. Moreover, the United States often processes and replicates the goods exported from China and resells them to various parts of Europe, making a lot of profit. In addition, the carpet manufacturing factories are six or seven stories high, and each floor is for manufacturing each part, from dry cleaning, sorting, selecting, dyeing, weaving yarn to completion, all relying on machines. Before the war, all these raw materials were imported from China, taking its softness suitable for stepping on and rich in elasticity. At present, those engaged in this industry in China have changed their course, and the export quantity is very small. They are taking their own exports to replace them, and they are gradually forgetting that our country's wool is the best raw material for carpets. This point is really worth paying attention to. This time returning to the country, it is decided to invite colleagues to discuss revitalization strategies.

Jiang talked about the United States raising yellow weasels and black foxes to seek product uniformity, which is very interesting. He briefly stated that yellow weasels have strong fertility, and those who raise them individually raise them after mating in order to improve the quality of the seeds, cutting males and keeping females when taking the skin. Usually, they are fed with fish, horse meat, wheat flour, and cod liver oil, and are prohibited from eating fat. As a result, the products are smooth and smooth, and each piece can be worth 20 US dollars. If a ranch has 1,000 yellow weasels, and after multiplying four times, it produces 4,000 skins, the total value can be 80,000 US dollars, deducting the cost, it can be profitable. Every year, the United States and Canada can sell a total of one million pieces. Black fox hair is long, and New York women's fashion does not like long hair. Its products are shipped to Canada and other places for sale. I think that in order to expand the sales of yellow weasel skins in China, improving varieties is an urgent task. If yellow weasel seeds are imported from the United States, the climate is also very suitable. A small-scale trial run requires about 50,000 US dollars. As for improving tanning, it is even more necessary to hire technicians and purchase machines, which costs more money. It cannot be accomplished overnight in a short time. It is necessary to wait for economic stability, gather comrades, and carefully plan.

Jiang also reiterated that in order to promote the export of fur, some parts may be appropriately referred to the consignment method. Try to observe the skins of sheep's heads, ears, noses, tails, and claws in our country, which are often discarded. If they are exquisitely inlaid into clothing and transported to foreign countries for sale, they may arouse the curiosity of American women and be welcomed by them. This is not a hot commodity. The sales method is nothing more than making an appointment with a fashion store for consignment exhibitions. Once purchased, it can gradually become popular for a while. On this point, I will make some suggestions to the Import and Export Management Committee in the near future.

Finally, Jiang said that China sold about 3 million yellow weasel skins to the United States last year. The initial offer was very good, but later the price fell to within 2 yuan due to the influx of goods, and the average value was 2-3 yuan per piece. A total of more than 500,000 lake sheep skins were sold, each worth one US dollar, and 1 million blue sheep skins were sold, initially worth more than 3 yuan, but later fell to one yuan. This spring, about 400,000 yellow weasel skins (last year's goods) have been exported, the actual output is 600,000, and 200,000 are sold domestically. According to the normal output, it can reach 1 million, and it is estimated that 700,000 can be collected this year. The current price of spot goods for foreign sales is about 4 yuan per pair. 300,000 lake sheep skins can be collected, and the current price is 1.45 yuan. About 1 million blue sheep skins, each worth about 1.2 yuan. If the situation improves and transportation resumes, the estimated output can be increased, he said.

### Credit Cooperative Checks Will Be Allowed to Be Used Again

Regarding the Ministry of Finance's prohibition of credit cooperatives from being the payer of checks, it is reported that the Ministry of Social Affairs has prepared a memorandum of reasons, intending to request the Executive Yuan to still allow credit cooperatives to be the payer of checks. Now, in order to strengthen the management of the business of urban credit cooperatives, so that they can develop normally and truly become a financial institution for the common people, the Ministry has consulted with the Ministry of Finance on a draft management method for urban credit cooperatives, which can be jointly requested from the Executive Yuan for approval, promulgation and implementation. The draft of the item method adopts a licensing system for the establishment of urban credit cooperatives. All urban credit cooperatives shall be transferred to the local competent authority to the two departments of the society and finance for identification. Those with unsound organization and business shall be dissolved. Those that have been approved for registration but have not yet started business must be re-examined before they can start business. For the rest, there are clear provisions on the admission of members of credit cooperatives, types of business, loans, amounts, terms, interest rates, deposit reserves, etc.

### Cigarette Sales Are Smooth and Prices Are Rising

Yesterday, the price of cigarettes on the market was mediocre at first, but then the market became brisk due to strong demand in the street. At about 9 o'clock, colleagues from other places dumped their goods, and the price seemed weak, but until the close of the noon, the old knife cigarettes were in high demand due to the lack of distribution for a long time, and the bottom was thin, and the buyer absorbed it very smoothly, making it as high as 17.7 million, which was 300,000 yuan higher than the previous day. British cigarettes rose by 100,000 yuan. In the half-day trend, the price gap between the Three Cannons and the White Tin Package was large, and the actual sales were very strong. At the close, the price of the Zhao brand increased by 2,000 to 158,000, and someone took it in. In addition, the buying interest in the 20-piece Qianmen Bank brand was also strong, and the market was firm and expensive. 50-piece canned cigarettes arrived in rare sales, and the price rose by 1,200 yuan. Other brandy, double axe, red gold, beauty, and other strip cigarettes were each worth 500 to 1,000 yuan.

### The Number of Tobacco Loans This Year is a Total of 28 Billion Yuan

According to the Four Joint Offices, the number of tobacco goods this year is a total of 28 billion yuan, of which 15.6 billion yuan of tobacco leaf production loans and 12.4 billion yuan of processing loans were issued to the two provinces of Anhui and Henan successively. 100,000 tobacco farmers in the two places benefited from planting tobacco.

### Prices in Chengdu Rise Again

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 16th] The price of Sichuan goods, which had been calm for more than a month, rose again on the 15th. On the 16th, each package of Chengdu 20 Shuanghong Wild Goose yarn was 24.9 million, and each piece of American Mishier Indigo Cloth was 2.15 million. All department stores were expensive, and food was stable. The reason is said to be due to insufficient US loans and the accumulation of wealth by wealthy families. The Provincial Capital Police Bureau immediately formed an economic inspection team to control it.

### The Sixth District Paper Industry Appeals for Relaxation of Import Quotas for Wood Pulp from 520,000 to 1 Million US Dollars.

The Sixth District Paper Industry Association has appealed to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, requesting that the quota be relaxed to 1 million US dollars in order to save the crisis in the industry. It is reported that the wood pulp quota for the first quarter is 450,000 US dollars. In addition to the 100,000 US dollars taken by the paper mills under the Resource Committee and the 50,000 US dollars retained by the paper mills in other districts, the factories in the area of the association only got 300,000 US dollars, which is too small. The second and third quarters are both 525,000 US dollars. In addition to 75,000 US dollars from paper mills in other districts, the factories actually got 450,000 US dollars, which can only import 1,5600 tons of pulp for three months, which is still a large number. If calculated according to the fully equipped production, 15,000 tons of pulp are actually needed per quarter. The current amount is only one-tenth of the amount, and each factory cannot continue to produce, resulting in a state of semi-stagnation, and it is extremely difficult to maintain. In the past, there were paper scraps and broken cloth that could be supplemented, but due to the urgent needs of each factory, the price was also very high. Recently, due to the spread of the war and the obstruction of transportation in various places, the survival of the factories is greatly panicked. Please relax the quota for each quarter to 1 million US dollars, which can import more than 3,000 tons, which is only one-fourth of the actual need, so that it can survive and save the precarious industry.

### After Japan Resumes Foreign Trade, There Are Still Many Difficulties in Private Transactions. Japanese Goods Are of High Price and Poor Quality, and Merchants Dare Not Handle Them Easily.

[Hong Kong Air Mail] The Hong Kong authorities have always adopted a support policy for private foreign trade since Japan announced the resumption of foreign trade. At a time when the government's US dollars are extremely difficult, various foreign exchange applications are restricted very strictly, but it can be seen from the fact that more than a dozen designated trading companies with Japan are designated to allocate a monthly foreign exchange quota of about 25,000 yuan per company. However, Japan's trade has been declared resumed, and now it will be three months. Hong Kong's trade with Japan, except for the government's ability to smoothly exchange goods, private trade has not yet been officially resumed. According to qualified people in trade with Japan, the biggest difficulty in trade with Japan is the high price of Japanese goods. At present, Japanese goods transactions are in US dollars. Although the products of Japanese merchants are based on Japanese yen, they are sold to the Allied authorities, and the Allied authorities calculate the export based on the price of goods around the world in US dollars. Therefore, some Japanese goods that can be exported are unwilling to start lightly due to the excessive price. Even in terms of glass paper with 300 numbers of 90×100 five hundred sheets, the Japanese price is more than 21.1 US dollars, which is not up and down compared with the current pricing in Europe. Secondly, another problem is that the Japanese side still does not allow the establishment of branch offices for Hong Kong businessmen engaged in private trade with Japan, so there are great difficulties in carrying out trade. The reason is that the Japanese have poor credit, which was true before the war, and their products are even worse after the war. For example, a batch of alarm clocks that arrived in Hong Kong a few months ago can be used as an example. Therefore, if there is no branch office established in Japan for contact, Hong Kong businessmen are really not at ease when ordering goods rashly. In addition, there are no inconvenient regulations in the export paper of goods exported to Japan in this port, but the Japanese side restricts the introduction of goods very strictly. Generally, there is no problem in importing raw materials that can be used for reproduction, but consumables and unnecessary goods are mostly listed as restricted imports. As for the transportation baby problem, which is of great importance to the development of trade prospects, ships belonging to Taikoo and Jardine Matheson often travel between Hong Kong and Japan, and there is no major obstacle to the transportation of goods. It's just that business communication between the two places is still difficult. At present, telegrams can be sent from Hong Kong to Japan, but once telegrams are sent directly from Japan to Hong Kong, it is impossible. Airmail from Japan can be paid by the US military aircraft to Hong Kong, but in Hong Kong, there is no civil aircraft to Japan, and military aircraft never fly to it, so airmail cannot be posted from Hong Kong to Japan. From the above-mentioned several major baby problems, the future private trade between Hong Kong and Japan is still difficult to be optimistic about. Regarding the barter exchange between Hong Kong Chang Bureau and Japan, the bulk of the goods transported by Japan to Hong Kong are cotton yarn, cloth, wool, and clocks. Among the goods transported from Hong Kong to Japan, grass mats are the most. This type of grass mat is in great need in Japan and is used for packaging Japanese tea, Japanese silk, and various products.

### Use of Anesthetics to Cut and Treat the Neck (Continued) - Examples of Unexpected Complications

— Liang Junqing

Furthermore, we have also studied the tortuous part of the carotid artery, which also deserves attention. According to Heymans' report, stimulating a dog's carotid artery with chemicals and severing its autonomic nerves will suddenly stop its breathing. Mr. Heymans has thoroughly examined the occurrence of this type of reflex. Previously, we believed that the lack of oxygen and the increase of carbon dioxide in the blood were the driving forces stimulating the respiratory center, but Heymans has proven that this effect is actually caused by a reflex near the carotid artery. Subsequently, several experts such as Heymans, Euler, Bouckaert, and Dautrebande further demonstrated that this type of reflex also exists at the tortuous part of the carotid artery. The stimulating effect of so-called lack of oxygen in the blood is actually an indirect effect. If we remove the reflex driving force of the carotid artery and the tortuous part of the carotid artery, then the lack of oxygen in the blood will not be enough to stimulate the respiratory center to breathe; on the contrary, it will only inhibit its breathing. The same is true when the carbon dioxide in the blood increases. Therefore, only when the reflex driving force (Chemoreceptouen) of the carotid artery and its tortuous part exists can carbon dioxide in the blood be actively utilized. A Mr. Castro believed that the reflex does not occur at the tortuous part of the carotid artery, but at the Glomus Carcticum (i.e., at the bifurcation of the aorta). Subsequently, Heymans also proved that this type of reflex does exist there, and its tortuous part is the regulating mechanism for blood pressure. In addition, there are also starting points for this reflex at the base of the heart and in the middle layer of the myocardium.

Based on the above situation, we can study whether the starting point of this type of reflex is related to the accidents that occur when anesthesia is performed during surgery. A Mr. Weese has conducted a detailed study of this type of problem. He injected turpentine oil near the bifurcation of the carotid artery of dogs to cause abscesses. At this time, he injected the usual amount of the above-mentioned anesthetic into the vein, and the result was no change. From this, it can be seen that the abscess itself does not have any direct effect that can cause the occurrence of a reflex. However, if half of the above amount is used, and at the same time, slight pressure is applied to the angle of the jaw, breathing will immediately stop, and no medicine can revive it. The most amazing thing is that if the side without an abscess is pressed with a finger, there is no change at all. If the anesthetic is injected into the vein and delayed for a moment, about five minutes later, even if the abscessed side is pressed, the above-mentioned breathing cessation phenomenon will not occur. In short, the longer the waiting period after injecting the anesthetic into the vein, the less likely this sudden cessation of breathing is. If the bifurcation of the carotid artery is completely cut off, this type of reflex will not occur. This is because the main organ of the reflex has been removed. Based on the above facts, we can infer that this type of reflex is the last to be affected by the anesthetic and inhibited during the anesthesia period. In other words, the nerve units at the bifurcation of the carotid artery are not easily inhibited by the anesthetic in the early stages of anesthesia, and can still produce a reflex that stimulates breathing cessation. Although this assumption is reasonable, it also needs to be proven by facts. According to Mr. Weese's opinion, because the posterior pharyngeal area here relies only on a single small artery to maintain blood supply, when an abscess occurs, it is extremely easy to stimulate the nerve units here to generate a reflex that inhibits breathing due to the obstruction of blood flow. We can certainly wonder why this type of reflex only occurs when an abscess is present? This is mostly because after the abscess occurs, the driving force of the reflex is more susceptible to stimulation, and its original inhibitory effect on breathing is enhanced as a result. If the anesthesia continues and the patient feels a deeper anesthesia, then at this time, the reflex nerve units in this area will also be anesthetized and will not have the phenomenon of inhibiting breathing again and can breathe normally. However, the stronger and faster the anesthetic effect, the more severe its reactive force will be, which is something that must be paid attention to (for example, when using Chioraetliy or Barbiturate).

In short, there are three factors that constitute sudden cessation of breathing: Inflammatory or purulent neck diseases; Short-term rapid infusion of anesthetics with a very fast anesthetic effect; Local mechanical stimulation (such as pressing the root of the tongue, pressing the neck, and waiting for the jaw to relax). When the above three factors are all present in the above-mentioned cases, it is clear that the patient will die. In view of the current unfortunate experience, we certainly know that using intravenous anesthetics during surgical operations for inflammatory neck diseases is the most dangerous act. If there is another method to think of, we must try our best to avoid it. If this method must be used, then it must be done with extreme caution. The injection must be absolutely slow, and after the injection, you must wait for a few minutes before taking other actions (such as pressing the root of the tongue, putting in a tongue depressor, and performing surgery). It is especially important to pay attention to avoiding all mechanical stimulation to the bifurcation of the carotid artery.

Junqing's note: Mr. Graf's report has greatly increased our knowledge. In the anesthesia period before surgical hand hygiene, there are often unexpected events of sudden respiratory arrest in patients. We do not know the reason, and always think it is due to "idiosyncrasy." Now, according to Mr. Ge's report, we know that there are still many complex factors that contribute to it. The case of Dr. Qian Mingzhao of Nanjing being accused may also be similar to this. But I don't know if anyone can study its details? Moreover, the above-mentioned case occurred in Sweden, and the chief surgeon was not accused of negligent homicide. If this case occurred in China, I don't know how far it would have gone. Alas, in such a scientifically backward country, after eight years of resistance war, we still don't think about making any changes to health administration and medical affairs that are closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood?

### A Corner of X-Ray Examination Statistics

— Ding Huikang

With the advancement of modern medicine, disease statistics are especially closely related to public health. From this, we can observe the rise and fall of a disease and the scope of its epidemic, so how to prevent problems before they occur and gradually eliminate them, change from treatment to prevention, and let the people live a long life. Isn't that a happy thing? This is our responsibility, and we must work together to do it. Now, I will list the X-ray examination statistics of 647 people in the Hongqiao Rehabilitation Hospital in October as follows, and I hope that the sages at home and abroad will teach me.

Bilateral Pulmonary Tuberculosis 56 people 8.62%

Bilateral Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Cavities 7 1.07

Bilateral Artificial Pneumothorax 2 0.30

Right Pulmonary Tuberculosis 57 8.77

Right Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Cavities 1 0.15

Left Pulmonary Tuberculosis 30 4.62

Left Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Cavities 2 0.30

Left Artificial Pneumothorax 2 0.30

Calcified Spots 10 1.54

Blurred Shadows 4 0.62

Pleural Thickening 13 2.00

Pleurisy 8 1.23

Deep Bronchial Shadows 135 20.79

Deep Hilar Lymph Node Shadows 24 3.69

Cardiomegaly 21 3.69

Normal Cardiopulmonary 282 43.42

Looking at the above statistics, we can see the following situations: The large number of people suffering from bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis can prove the lack of general social knowledge. Although both lungs are diseased, they are still unaware of it, which is really regrettable. At the same time, it can be seen that the initial symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are extremely mild, and general diagnosis is difficult. X-ray examination is essential. The age between 20 and 30 years old is the peak of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, especially around 25 years old is the most dangerous age. From the perspective of occupation, "42 people out of 157 unemployed people were found to have pulmonary tuberculosis, which is almost one-third. This situation deserves special attention.

### Two Major Advances in the Scientific World

— Yang Shi

The realm of the scientific world is expanding day by day, and soon there will probably be many new stocks coming in to continue to expand its scope. The end of October this year is the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in the United States. At this anniversary meeting, the entire American scientific community had wonderful speeches. The most noteworthy thing is that two scientists who won the Nobel Prize announced their groundbreaking discoveries that shocked the academic world.

The Secret of Matter

Ernest O. Lawrence, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics and inventor of Cyclotrons, announced that he had recently built a 4,000-ton Synchro-cyclotron and had discovered the secret of the mysterious and powerful "Binding force" in the original ten nuclei. When this synchrocyclotron was turned on for the first time at the University of California, powerful rays were emitted from its circular inner chamber. This powerful ray still retained more than half of its intensity after penetrating a foot-thick lead plate. After research by many scientists, it was discovered that this beam was composed of neutrons (particles in the nucleus without charge). Once there are deuterons (heavy hydrogen nuclei) in the impactor to impact the target, these neutrons are shattered and left behind. At the same time, under the leadership of Lawrence, they seemed to be playing with toys all day long, and finally proved that this neutron beam can almost impact any atom and destroy any radioactive element.

We know that all atomic nuclei (except hydrogen atoms) contain two or more protons. Protons all carry a positive charge. In theory, they should repel each other very strongly, but they are attracted by a mysterious binding force. Where does this binding force come from? For many years, tens of thousands of scientists have been seeking its answer, and today it is finally revealed.

Long before World War II, German Nobel Prize in Physics winner Dr. Werner Heisenberg had used mathematical formulas to deduce a theory to explain this phenomenon. He believed that the charge between protons and neutrons in the nucleus is quickly exchanged back and forth. When a particle gains a charge, it becomes a proton, and when it loses a charge, it becomes a neutron. It is this "Charge exchange" phenomenon that produces this powerful binding force. However, he has never been able to prove the correctness of this theory.

Now, Lawrence has helped him prove this theory. When high-speed neutrons impact on the walls of an ionized impactor, what bounces back are protons. He believes that the proton that jumps back is the neutron that went to hit the wall. In addition, when a neutron and a proton are very close, the charge on the proton jumps back and forth between the two. Once the two come into contact, the charge immediately goes to the neutron, making it a proton. If this phenomenon is the only explanation for the binding force between protons in the nucleus, it will be an extremely powerful new advance in the scientific world today.

The Secret of Life

The day after the anniversary ceremony, Wendell M. Stanley of the Rockefeller Institute for Midical Reasearch raised an explosive and mysterious question: What is life?

Dr. Stanley is an authority on American germ research and winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Twelve years ago, he discovered a fact that shocked the academic world, that a certain virus (the virus that causes tobacco mosaic disease) is "Both living and dead". It can reproduce like a living organism and also form crystals like an inorganic chemical. This new development immediately attracted widespread attention, and thousands of scientists immediately went to explore this new field. Recently, Dr. Shi has integrated some research materials on these semi-living and semi-dead tiny things, which has made him have new progress in the explanation of life.

This very small virus cannot be seen under an ordinary microscope, but it can be seen very clearly under an electron microscope. The virus that causes tobacco mosaic is a tiny rod. These rod-shaped viruses can interact with each other from a long distance, like small magnets interacting with each other. Although he cannot explain this "Long-Range force", he has a new understanding of the life of organisms from this. He and his assistants used a series of "Chemical Process" to "stop the activity" (actually die) of this virus, and then reversed this chemical process to revive it. From this point of view, in the future, it may not be possible to use a certain chemical process to let humans die in a test tube and then revive them.

Most of these viruses contain proteins and amino acids. Precise chemical methods can be used to increase or decrease the amino acids in their bodies, which can turn active viruses into lethargic ones and mild viruses into virulent toxins. And they found that once they change their physique, they also permanently change their descendants. Therefore, Dr. Stanley predicts that this has a great connection with human life, because human transfer factors (a small particle in cells that can control human heredity) and viruses are very similar. It is very possible that just a small change in the number of amino acids in the transfer factor can greatly change heredity. If this is the case, if humans improve their transfer factors, can they control their own evolution? The doctor said: "Yes, this is possible... but this knowledge is somewhat damaging to the self-esteem of humans who think they are superior."

This is an Antarctic penguin, which is kind, quiet and well-organized, standing upright like a human figure. When young, its fur is all black. After growing up, its chest fur is white and its back fur is black. It only lays two eggs in its life, which are incubated into chicks in the ice and snow. It can still continue its species. Nature is also wonderful. (Xi)

### Salt and Life

— Peel

Salt is what we see every day. It is a square crystal. It is not as indispensable as rice for every meal, nor is it as casual as candy that you can choose not to eat. It is also something that must be eaten, but you can occasionally miss one or two meals. If it is often lacking, then the human body will gradually feel uncomfortable, and the neck will gradually become thick and swollen, which is a goiter. Then the spirit will decline, and other diseases will follow! In the human body's tissues, salt is abundant. You see, blood, muscles, sweat, and urine all have a salty taste.

But salt itself is composed of two elements, chlorine and sodium. Elemental chlorine is very poisonous, so of course it is not desirable. Elemental sodium cannot be eaten either, because its chemical properties are extremely strong. If you put sodium into water, it will undergo a violent chemical change, turning into sodium hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas, while generating high heat, and even exploding. But combining sodium and hydrogen to form salt is a good thing with a salty taste, and many delicacies rely on it.

Humans need it, and any animal needs it, so won't it be used up like coal? But it won't. It is abundant in nature. The boundless ocean is three percent salt, and there is also rock salt on the mainland. Moreover, salt can be said to be cyclical for animals. The amount eaten is the same as the amount excreted. On a larger scale, the life and death of animals is a larger cycle of salt, so it is absolutely inexhaustible.

The most amazing thing is the mystery of nature's coordination. What nature contains in abundance is not elemental sodium and elemental chlorine, because sodium cannot exist alone, nor is it other compounds of sodium and chlorine, but their own compound, salt. Of course, we can also extract salt from other compounds of chlorine and sodium, but it is troublesome after all, and it is definitely not as convenient as drying seawater. Furthermore, the properties of salt are similar to those of potassium chloride and not much different from those of magnesium chloride. However, what nature contains in abundance is not a large amount of potassium chloride or magnesium chloride, because potassium chloride has no taste, and magnesium chloride is too bitter to eat. Only delicious salt is especially convenient for people. Salt is dissolved in seawater and can be taken at any time. Of course, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride can replace salt, but if the salt on earth is replaced with magnesium chloride or potassium chloride, then people will lose many of their taste pleasures.

### New Treasures in the Sea

— Sun Jialin

Many seaweeds grow in the ocean. These green and brown plants are of little use except for feeding cattle. In coastal areas, they are even an obstacle to navigation. British scientists have taken a fancy to it during this war, and the value of seaweed has been raised suddenly.

Seaweed can be used to make many substitutes, such as shiny silk underwear, shirts, socks, paper, cosmetics, rubber, furniture, plastics, and many other items. The uses are so wide that they cannot be exhausted.

After a long period of hard research, scientists have extracted Alginic Acid from seaweed. Once this substance is refined, it can obtain shiny rayon, which is strong and durable. When woven into cloth, it can be dyed and is not inferior to cotton yarn. Its advantages are that it is waterproof and fireproof. Even if it is soaked in kerosene and burned with fire, the oil will be exhausted and this substance will be intact.

Therefore, this new industry is about to develop, because seaweed is inexhaustible and inexhaustible. The vast ocean has become a rich source of raw materials. Just think, the area of the Sargaso Sea alone is 2.5 million miles, which exceeds all the wheat fields on the entire earth. It is no problem to collect tens of millions of tons.

In addition to industry, seaweed also has new uses in agriculture, because it contains a large amount of potassium, which is an indispensable fertilizer for plants. Therefore, Scotland and Ireland are now applying this seaweed fertilizer in large quantities. The war made Britain know the benefits of seaweed. These cheap and unlimited raw materials will inevitably become increasingly important.

This beautiful bryozoan is gregarious and can be used in painting. (Xi)

### Will Atoms Change?

— Bao Zhongqi

Anyone with a little scientific knowledge knows that atoms can change, right? If atoms could not change, the atomic bomb could not have been invented at all, because the atomic bomb uses the fission characteristics of uranium. A neutron is used to hit the uranium atom, so that the uranium atom undergoes a chain reaction. Each uranium splits into three neutrons, releasing a large amount of latent energy, and the body changes into other elements. This is the most obvious example of the ability of atoms to change.

However, when we open chemistry books, the most basic Dalton's Atomic Theory says: An atom is the smallest particle that makes up matter; the same atoms that make up the same compound must have the same shape and weight; no atoms can be split, created, or destroyed.

In fact, we know that all three of these points are wrong: First, an atom is not the smallest particle that makes up matter. According to modern scientific knowledge, we know that electrons, protons, and neutrons are the smallest particles. Second, the shape and weight of the same atoms are not necessarily equal, because isotopes are proof. Take uranium as an example. Its isotopes include uranium-238 and uranium-234. If there were no isotopes, then the atomic weight would not have numbers after the decimal point.

As for the third point, it is more worthy of our discussion. Atoms can absolutely be split, created, and destroyed, which is also the foothold for our discovery of new elements. I might as well still take uranium as an example and look at its characteristics of splitting, creating, and destroying:

Uranium-238 can lose an Alfa particle and become uranium-234; it can then lose an Alfa particle and become a thorium element; it can also lose a second Alfa particle and become radium. Radium has a very long half-life, about 1690 years. It can conveniently allow radium to emit Alfa particles until it itself completely becomes a type of radium emanation (one of the rare gases), called Radon. At the same time, Radon can still continue to release Alfa and Beta particles and become lead. This process of a radioactive element splitting, destroying, and creating other elements naturally takes a very long time, but if we have a fully equipped laboratory, we can easily see this characteristic immediately.

Science is constantly evolving and changing with each passing day. People living in the 20th century atomic age should know that Dalton's atomic theory of 1804 is not entirely correct.

### Infrared Rays

— Ke Zhi

Both infrared and ultraviolet rays are invisible because infrared rays have too long a radiation wavelength and ultraviolet rays have too short a radiation wavelength, so human eyes do not perceive them. However, in today's rapidly advancing science, clever scientists have turned them into visible things. Towards the end of World War II, American scientists finally used infrared rays to invent two new types of weapons: night vision scopes and night binoculars, which are suitable for night combat. It is said that these weapons were used during the US military's attack on Iwo Jima, causing significant damage to the enemy in the dark. These weapons work by emitting electrons through the action of infrared rays, and the electrons are then focused on a fluorescent screen through electronic lenses, thus creating an image. This is entirely an invention of electronics. However, recent research by several experts at the US General Electric Research Laboratory seems to have made further progress. It is said that adding a small piece of lead to zinc sulfide can make invisible infrared rays visible after exposure. This invention can simplify the devices of night vision scopes and night binoculars.

If infrared rays are used as signals, others cannot see them, but those with special devices can receive them. During World War II, the cutting of Pacific submarine cables, the sinking of the giant floating dock in Bergen Harbor, Norway, by the German pocket battleship "Admiral Scheer" and another Japanese battleship's small submarine in September 1944, and the North African landing operations all used them. In addition, the secret activities of underground workers, the escape of allies, and the crossing of the Rhine River at night all relied on infrared rays for guidance. Night combat by the air force also used infrared rays as signals. In amphibious warfare, infrared rays were the most miraculous form of communication between sea and land. Automatic weapons equipped with infrared automatic sights have also been invented, but due to the early end of the war, they have not been officially used on the battlefield.

There is also a sound-emitting electric light that is created using infrared rays. This method of using infrared rays for communication had already been applied to warfare by Germany and Japan during the war, but this method cannot be used for long distances. However, within a range of about ten miles, where military telephones or wireless telephones cannot be installed, this method of communication using infrared rays is applicable. However, their communication devices did not use cesium. Later, Dr. Beese of the United States designed it and realized that this metal is a very efficient infrared wave emitter, and at the same time is a poor illuminant, so there is no need to use a filtering device, and the signal will not be seen by others. It is said that this cesium vapor lamp using cesium, although not completed during the war, will appear soon.

In short, the progress of science is endless. As long as we can catch up and work hard on research, we will invent more ingenious and useful things.

### Reader Consultation Legal Questions Stubborn Father Favors Sons Over Daughters Son Receives Thousands of Acres of Land for Wedding, Daughter Receives Nothing

Editor: I am a twenty-one-year-old girl, now struggling under the extreme constraints of feudalism. My parents have two sons and one daughter, and from birth, they have favored sons over daughters, pampering their sons in every possible way while being extremely harsh to their daughters. My two older brothers have both received a university education. My eldest brother got married this summer with a lavish ceremony, and my father gave him thousands of acres of land and dozens of houses. My second brother also received the same property, while I, their daughter, received nothing. I am aware of my lack of knowledge and inability to support myself. Also, because I am unfamiliar with the law, I cannot argue reasonably. Now, I have several questions that I hope your newspaper's legal section can answer. I would be extremely grateful. Does an unmarried daughter have inheritance rights to her father's property? Is the father's method of distributing property to his sons in this way legal from a legal standpoint? What methods should the daughter use to deal with this? If the daughter is without fault, can the parents maliciously disown her? What crime would this constitute under the law? If the father passes away, can the daughter claim her rightful inheritance from her brothers? From reader Jiang Zeyuan

[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (540) Yes. (Article 1138 of the Civil Code on Inheritance stipulates that, in addition to the spouse, direct lineal descendants are also included in the heirs of the estate. Therefore, sons and daughters have exactly the same inheritance rights to their father's property.) Impeding the allocation of the reserved portion of the estate is not legally compliant. A biological father cannot legally disown a daughter. Yes.
