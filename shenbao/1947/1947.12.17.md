### U.S. Congress Approves Foreign Aid Bill, House Appropriations Committee Reduces Amount, Marshall to Expedite Aid to China

[U.S. News Agency Report, Washington, 15th] Congress has completed the approval of $597 million for temporary aid to Austria, China, France, and Italy. The approved bill now only awaits President Truman's signature, so that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation can prepay $150 million to the State Department to assist the aided countries. House Majority Leader Halleck said that the Appropriations Committee will present the appropriations bill on Tuesday for debate.

[United Press, Washington, 15th] Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges said on the 15th that he would again hear General Wedemeyer's arguments regarding aid to China on the 17th, but it is not yet certain whether the committee will accept Wedemeyer's long-term China survey report. At the same time, the committee will hear arguments from Bullitt, Chou I-te, and Mrs. Luce, chairman of the American China Policy Association, as well as other State Department officials. According to Bridges, the committee will request a statement from the State Department regarding its China aid policy before deciding whether to recommend an emergency fund for aid to China. [This newspaper's report] New York, 16th, broadcast: Washington report, the House Appropriations Committee has submitted a bill to the House that reduces the foreign aid funds approved by Congress by $88 million and the funds requested by the Army Department for overseas occupied areas by more than $260 million. The committee also proposed a supplementary appropriations bill, which stipulates two points: $500.9 million for emergency aid, which is 15% less than the relief funds approved by Congress on the 15th for France, Italy, Austria, and China; and $230 million for the U.S. military occupied areas of Germany, Japan, Korea, and Austria, which is a reduction of slightly less than 53% from the $490 million originally proposed by the Army Department. The committee expressed doubt about the soundness of the overseas relief plan. The appropriations committee did not stipulate funds for aid to China in the proposed bill, although this aid has been approved by Congress and is currently awaiting President Truman's signature. The committee believes that it is not appropriate to allocate funds to China because there is no plan for aid to China. The committee also doubts whether aid to France, Italy, and Austria can produce concrete results. Of the $88 million reduced by the appropriations committee, $66 million was reduced from aid to France and $22 million from aid to Austria.

[This newspaper's report] New York, 16th, broadcast: Washington report, General Clay expressed his opinion in the Appropriations Committee today, considering it inappropriate for the committee to greatly reduce the U.S. Army's requested funds for overseas occupation, as these funds are necessary to maintain order and stability in the overseas occupied areas. [Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] Officials here believe that after the London Conference is deadlocked, Marshall will expedite the China aid plan when he returns to Washington on the 19th. [Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] U.S. Senator Vandenberg said in the Senate that, given the meager amount of aid China has received to date, China "has full right to enjoy" U.S. aid. Vandenberg also told the Senate that his views and "the U.S. official stance on China are difficult to reconcile." He continued that he had repeatedly requested that a "different attitude" be adopted towards China, but he did not specify his policies. Vandenberg said that if senators on the joint committee insisted on deleting the China aid portion from the aid package passed by the House, this would be a "double prejudice" on the Senate side, which might cause a "misunderstanding of our basic attitude towards China." He reiterated that the door to China has been opened, and that some senators on the joint committee are unwilling to close the door. Senator Connally, a prominent Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pointed out that Marshall will soon submit a China aid plan to Congress. He claimed that the $18 million under the relief fund that has not yet been allocated after the end of the UNRRA, plus $30 million under the relief plan, can help China get through the end of this year. According to news reports, it is expected that Congress will pass the appropriations bill before adjourning on the 19th.

### The Communist Bandits in the Deng-Bian-Xu Triangle Area Were Attacked From Both Sides, the Battle to Defend Lanfeng Started, and the Station and the South Pass Were Fiercely Contested

[This newspaper, Zhengzhou, 16th] The advance troops of Chen Yi's bandit army, numbering more than 10,000, who disrupted the Zheng-Bian-Xu triangle area, have been attacked from both east and west by the elite National Army, cut into two sections, and isolated from each other, making it easy to annihilate them. After being repelled, the bandits who disturbed Xin Zheng are now attacking the county seat again, and a fierce battle is underway. [This newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The remnants of the 11th Column of Chen Yi's bandit army, which had fled from western Shandong to the Bian-dong Minfeng Station, have been defeated by the National Army. The remnants of the bandits fled towards Tongxu. The National Army not only sent a part to clear out the scattered bandits near Erfeng, but also sent a team to continue the pursuit and suppression. On the 15th, a unit of the National Army in eastern Henan fought fiercely with the remnants of the 8th Column of Chen Yi's bandits, who had fled south from western Shandong near Suixian, killing more than 2,000 officers and soldiers, including Zhou Changsheng, commander of the 24th Division of the bandits, and seizing a large number of spoils of war. The remnants of the bandits fled northwest.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 16th] The battle to defend Lanfeng has reached its most intense stage by noon on the 16th. Because the communist bandits were frustrated in their attack, they repeatedly sent reinforcements, reaching a total of 20,000. Taking advantage of the dusty weather and the cold wind, they repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the city. Our defending troops used intense firepower to stop them. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, especially the fight for the station and the South Pass, which was even more tragic. More than 1,000 bandit corpses could be seen at the station in the suburbs of the city, and many of our soldiers outside the city also perished with their positions, which can be described as heroic. [Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th] The National Army held on to Xuchang with extraordinary courage and determination, causing a regiment of Chen Yi's bandits who had launched a fierce attack in the past two days to suffer setbacks without success. At the moment, although the bandits are using field artillery to bombard the west and south passes, the defending army is also returning fire with fierce artillery fire, so the bandits still cannot get close to the city walls.

At the moment, the 1st, 3rd, and 6th Columns of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops are passing through Guangshan Beiqiao, and their advance troops have crossed the Huai River. As for the local communist troops under Li Xiannian and Huo Erzhu, numbering about 20,000, they have crossed west of the Pinghan Railway and are constantly disrupting the transportation line. The National Army is pursuing and suppressing them according to the three principles of "pursuit", "strangulation", and "repression". When asked about the traffic situation on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, Xu replied: The destroyed tracks south of Xinyang have been repaired.

Editorial

### Preventing Speculative Capital from Wreaking Havoc Requires Currency Reform

When liquid capital cannot find legitimate outlets or destinations, it collectively transforms into speculative capital. Excessive speculative capital, unable to find application, rushes en masse into speculative markets, fueling a frenzy of hoarding and speculation. Moreover, the high profits, reduced expenses, and simple procedures of hoarding and speculation cause existing production capital to transform into speculative capital, vying to flow into speculative markets. Consequently, speculative capital increases, speculation intensifies, prices soar, production shrinks, and the economy becomes chaotic. The primary enemy of the entire national economy now can be said to be the so-called speculative capital.

As early as the Anti-Japanese War, the topic of how to channel or absorb speculative capital had taxed the brains of many. Since the promulgation of emergency economic measures and economic reform plans, all parties have given increasing importance to this issue and have adopted many countermeasures. However, the results have been extremely limited. On the contrary, the power of speculative capital to wreak havoc seems to be increasing daily. What exactly is the reason for this? Now, let us examine various possible preventative measures separately as a reference for learning from past mistakes.

Tightening credit has been implemented repeatedly in the past and is currently being intensified. Measures such as halting loans, blocking remittances, and strengthening the inspection of financial institutions are unprecedented in their stringency and thoroughness. The temporary effect it can produce is certainly not to be dismissed. However, given the various needs of the nation, after financial institutions make adjustments, the tightening of credit cannot but be relaxed gradually. In addition, the legitimate uses of industry and commerce, and the inter-port flow of goods, mean that all loans and remittances cannot be uniformly and permanently halted, as this would hinder the vitality of the economy. Leaving aside other considerations, as the end of the year approaches, various industries are clamoring for so-called year-end bonuses. This expenditure often requires billions or even hundreds of billions for larger companies and factories. If we blindly prohibit it without providing financial assistance, how can the business community overcome this difficulty? Therefore, tightening credit can only be said to be a temporary, palliative measure that cannot fundamentally solve the problem of speculative capital.

Selling off goods, releasing state-owned goods to collect legal tender from the market, is a more practical method. The question is whether the legal tender, once returned, can be held and not released again! How much goods are being sold? Can they be sold continuously? Looking at the past example of selling gold, this policy has clearly failed.

Issuing public bonds is originally a legitimate way for the government to absorb speculative capital. Unfortunately, in the context of declining currency value and excessively low-interest rates, people do not feel interested. The performance of the issuance of US Treasury bonds is a good example.

Encouraging savings faces the same reasons for its ineffectiveness as the above. Now that the interest rate on bank deposits has been decided not to be increased, this avenue can be said to be blocked.

Selling state-owned enterprises is also the most ideal outlet. Unfortunately, the method of sale has been delayed in resolution. Based on the already announced plans to sell state-owned enterprises through the issuance of stocks and the organization of bank syndicates, the better parts are mostly reserved, and future management rights are clearly in the hands of state institutions and official shares. How much interest the general capitalists will have in this is a major question.

Banning private lending is banning underground banks and commercial firm deposits. Commercial firm deposits are a customary practice among the people. When institutional deposit rates are too low and institutional lending is strictly limited, it is an unworkable method unless there is an intention to completely stifle industry and commerce. Moreover, smaller towns in the interior simply do not have banks. If commercial firms are truly forbidden from accepting deposits, where are these deposits supposed to go? Where will these commercial firms go for financing? As for underground banks, as illegal organizations, they should be banned. However, even after completely eradicating them, this only blocks one avenue for speculative capital to operate, while still failing to absorb speculative capital.

Introducing specialized production is a goal everyone eagerly anticipates. In reality, people seek profit as water flows downhill. As long as there is profit to be made, why would they need the government to guide them before engaging in production? It is simply that the current production environment is too bad, and there are too many intentional or unintentional obstacles to production from all sides. The government's empty words of encouragement are far less powerful than the actual obstacles encountered. Established production enterprises are still struggling to extricate themselves, or suffering from the inability to do so. Who would avoid the easy and seek the difficult, inviting trouble for themselves? Therefore, this approach ultimately remains just a nice-sounding phrase.

Raising the standard of living, that is, increasing people's consumption to reduce private speculative capital, is clearly an avenue that our country cannot take at present. This is because there is a severe shortage of goods, and the government is promoting frugality and expanding rationing to limit waste. There are also too many poor people and refugees in various places. These people simply have no capital to spare and urgently need assistance from all sides to survive. How can they increase their consumption!

Increasing income tax is also a dead end. This is because the current tax burden on the people is already too heavy. I have heard one industrialist complain that these two taxes alone already take away more than 70% of their profits, not including other various taxes and levies. Furthermore, property tax, business tax, license plate tax, business license tax, and entertainment tax have recently been increased or are being discussed for increase. How can we blindly kill the chicken to get the eggs, further increasing the burden on the general public? The wealth distribution in society is currently too unequal, and a general income tax system has not been established. The burden of many taxes is ultimately shifted to the middle and lower classes. Therefore, it is inappropriate and practically impossible to use increased taxes to recover speculative capital at present.

Raising the price of daily necessities would be equivalent to increasing taxes, and is, of course, also inappropriate. Moreover, we are currently striving to suppress prices to stabilize people's livelihoods, and there is no possibility of taking the opposite path. Even if it were possible, only in countries with comprehensive rationing or totalitarian politics could the pricing of daily necessities be completely controlled by the state. This is unrealistic for our country at present.

The above measures have either been implemented with little effect, or have yet to be tested, or have been partially implemented in practice even if not tried on the surface, but all fail to alleviate the rampant spread of speculative capital. Therefore, if we truly want to channel or absorb speculative capital, we must devise alternative strategies. We believe that the most practical and effective approach is still to start with currency reform to stabilize the currency value.

If the currency value can be stabilized, then prices will naturally stabilize as well, and the wind of speculation and hoarding will subside without the need for strict prohibition. The increase in savings, the issuance of public bonds, and the decline of underground banks are all inevitable consequences. Therefore, the recent proposals for currency reform should be the only way to solve the problem of speculative capital. If loans are successfully secured and there is a fund, we should seize the opportunity and implement it decisively, without letting it slip away again. This is because the problem of speculative capital is the entire national economic problem. Other aspects such as production, construction, transportation, etc., are just parts of it. Without economic stability, all construction is out of the question. The distinction between fundamental and superficial priorities must be clearly recognized. If we let go of opportunities for reform, and wait until we reach the stage of the Mark, Ruble, or Coruna, and then exchange them at a massive discount, no matter how appealing the stated reasons are, the losses suffered by the people will be too great. The Soviet Union has implemented currency reform to curb inflation. The new Ruble began circulating yesterday. Their method of currency reform is worth our reference.

### Chu Xichun's Talk

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] After the Executive Yuan approved Chu Xichun as the Chairman of Hebei Province, Chu met with reporters, saying: "I have spent half my life in the military. It is a great honor to have the opportunity to serve my hometown at this time. Although we are in a period of turmoil, all policies in Hebei in the future will be aligned with military needs. In the future, Hebei will especially focus on organizing and training the people and winning over young people. Baoding is of great importance to the relationship between Peiping and Tianjin, and it must be defended. Based on my experience in defending Datong, Baoding, apart from needing more troops, will not be difficult to defend. The Hebei Provincial Government will still be located there." Chu is currently busy in Peiping deploying the lineup of the provincial government and will fly to Pan on the 18th to hand over.

[Another Dispatch] Chu Xichun is busy in Peiping today with personnel evaluations and visiting respected local figures in Hebei. It is rumored that the authorities intend to appoint Zhang Bojin, the current Deputy Mayor of Peiping, as the Director of Education, and Zheng Daoru as the Director of Finance.

[Another Dispatch] The Hebei Provincial Association held a board of directors meeting today. Zhang Yinwu proposed that four representatives should be sent to meet the newly appointed Chairman of Hebei, Chu Xichun, to suggest two points: 1. To be cautious about personnel matters. 2. To adopt key policies to adapt to the current extraordinary situation.

[This Newspaper, Baoding, 16th] The Hebei administrative center has moved back to Baoding. Most of the provincial government personnel who remained in Peiping have returned south. Bunkers line the route between Peiping and Baoding, and heavily armed troops guard the line, with cavalry units searching the railway sides day and night to eliminate bandits.

### Communist Bandits and the Soviet Union Sign Military Alliance, It is Said

(Continued from Page 1)

The CCP has agreed to allow the Soviet Union priority rights to exploit mineral deposits and agreed to establish a "Sino-Soviet Trade Company" to exclude American influence in China. The Soviet Union has the right to temporarily station troops in Xinjiang and Northeast China. In the event of war, Xinjiang, Northeast China, northern Japan, northern Korea, and Inner Mongolia will be designated as the Far East theater of war, with the Soviet Red Army in charge of the supreme command. The CCP will be the deputy commander-in-chief and concurrently the commander-in-chief of the China theater. To establish a CCP air force, possibly incorporating it into the Sino-Soviet joint air force. The CCP is responsible for providing news related to China, the expansion of the CCP organization, and the Far East China Intelligence Bureau. If war breaks out in the Balkans and the Middle East, the CCP will send an expeditionary force of 100,000 to 200,000 troops and provide a workforce of one million people.

[United Press, This City] Well-informed sources have no knowledge of the mutual assistance agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the CCP, as reported by the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Daily. They said: "There is no way to immediately verify whether this news is accurate."

MacArthur States Japan Cannot Re-arm

American officials in Washington and Tokyo are now hopeful about Sino-American cooperation in resolving the Japanese peace treaty. MacArthur personally hopes that China can recognize Japan as a part of Asia and that friendly relations must be maintained for the benefit of both countries. MacArthur also stated: "Japan will never again become a military power, threatening world peace. Japan has been completely disarmed, and the future peace treaty must include provisions to prevent Japan from ever re-arming. What is needed now is cooperation among Asian countries to strive for friendship and prosperity."

America Needs Greater Ryukyu, No Ambition for Taiwan

Regarding the future status of the Greater Ryukyu Islands, Van believes that "diplomatic circles all believe that this island will be transferred to American administration under the United Nations trusteeship system, as the peace of the Western Pacific relies on American strength and requires the Greater Ryukyu Islands as a base." As for Taiwan, everyone agrees that the Cairo Conference's official statement specifies that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and all Americans believe that Taiwan is currently and will continue to be a part of Chinese territory. The vast majority of the people of Taiwan belong to the Chinese race.

Soviet Union Cannot Build Atomic Bomb in Five Years

Van admits to the tense situation between the United States and the Soviet Union, but it will not lead to war. He said: "There is no risk of a large-scale war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The main reason is that the Soviet Union currently lacks the necessary weapons. The Soviet Union may have theoretically learned how to make the atomic bomb, but it cannot actually engage in manufacturing until it can build the necessary large power plants, and this will take at least five to ten years. At the same time, the Soviet Union has no navy worth mentioning, and the Russians know that historically no one has ever won a major war without acquiring sea power. In addition, the Soviet Union lacks the industrial manufacturing capacity to produce large quantities of airplanes, automobiles, and the thousands of supplies needed for modern warfare. Therefore, all first-class experts believe that there will be no war between the United States and the Soviet Union for at least ten years."

### Central Executive Committee Passes Resolution to Organize Funeral Committee

(Continued from Page 1)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Central Government deeply mourns the passing of Mr. Zhang Puquan, a member of the National Government Committee and Standing Committee Member of the Central Supervisory Committee. The Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang held a special meeting on the morning of the 16th to discuss funeral arrangements. Chairman Yu Youren, while reporting on the details of Zhang's death, broke down in tears, and the entire meeting was filled with grief. In addition to requesting that the National Government issue an order to organize a funeral committee, it was also resolved that all standing committee members of the party's Executive and Supervisory Committees would participate as members of the funeral committee, with Yu Youren, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Lifu serving as chairmen. Yu Zai, Xu Renru, Di Ying, Hong Lanyou, Wang Qijiang, Xu Jingzhi, Han Zhensheng, and Zhang Qingyuan were appointed as executive secretaries of the funeral committee to prepare for the funeral immediately. Given Zhang's noble character and integrity, which are admired throughout the country, the funeral arrangements should uphold the spirit of frugality and simplicity of Zhang's life, focusing on simplicity and solemnity.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 16th] After the news of the death of Committee Member Zhang Ji spread, various circles here deeply felt the loss. Zhang's wife, Madam Cui Zhenhua, is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 17th to attend the funeral.

### Feng Yuxiang Criticizes Government, Chinese Embassy in US Expresses Dismay

[United Press, Washington, 15th] The Chinese Embassy today issued a statement regarding Feng Yuxiang's criticism of Chairman Chiang and the Nanjing government, saying: "The Chinese Embassy is deeply dismayed to hear that Feng Yuxiang has issued a main article criticizing Chairman Chiang and the National Government, and opposing American aid to China. Feng, as an official of the government he criticizes, receives his official salary and has all his travel and inspection expenses in the United States provided by the government. Feng's claim that the Nanjing government has at least 200 propagandists stationed in the United States working solely to obtain loans and other aid is completely untrue. To the best of the Embassy's knowledge, there are no such propagandists in the United States."

### Draft Measures for Importing Raw Materials for Export Products Completed

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Many of our country's export products require foreign raw materials. Since the government controlled imports, the limited import of raw materials has meant that products are only used domestically, greatly affecting exports. In order to solve this difficulty, the Export-Import Management Committee has drafted measures for importing raw materials for the manufacture of exportable goods, aiming to expand exports and earn foreign exchange. The draft was passed by the committee's fifth meeting. After the measures are implemented, various industries such as handicraft and light industry products such as straw hats, cotton fabrics, embroidery, enameled utensils, and thermos bottles can use these measures to import raw materials, process them, and export them for sale abroad. The government can use the current small foreign exchange expenditure to earn more foreign exchange income in the near future, and related agricultural and industrial producers can also use this to revive and prosper, benefiting both national economy and people's livelihood. The measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan, and the Yuan has convened relevant agencies to review them, making appropriate revisions to the original measures and ordering the Export Management Committee to announce and implement them, and submitting them to the National Government for record. A report was made at the 34th meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 16th.

### Meeting for Three Weeks Without Achievement: Four Foreign Ministers' Conference Breaks Down; U.S. and France Discuss West German Economic Merger; Molotov Hastily Flew Back to Moscow with Entourage Yesterday

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: High-ranking sources with good connections in diplomatic circles stated that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall will hold a meeting with French Foreign Minister Bidault tonight to discuss the issue of the economic merger of West Germany. Marshall may present Bidault with a merger plan as a result of the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Bidault held a press conference today stating that in the near future, the U.K., U.S., and France will discuss ways to address the issue of West Germany and that a solution must be found. The U.S. delegation held a special meeting today to discuss the various issues arising from the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. Molotov and his entourage have left the U.K. today to return to their country. According to U.S. sources, the Four Foreign Ministers' representatives are scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow to make a final effort on the Austrian treaty issue.

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: French Foreign Minister Bidault held a press conference today, saying that the U.K., U.S., and France forming a West German government has not been considered, but hinted that the economic merger of the three occupation zones will generally be proposed. The U.S. delegation believes that the economic merger of West Germany is a necessary move, and then from economic unity, seek political unity.

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: Berlin News, it is certain that Molotov has arrived in Berlin, and due to the inclement weather, he will probably spend the night in Berlin.

[United Press, Washington, 15th] The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Marshall, because the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in London was unsuccessful, will fly back to the country on Thursday.

[Reuters, London, 15th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, due to the opposition of the U.K., U.S., and France to the Soviet Union's request to extract German production as compensation, apparently had no possibility of breaking the deadlock, and in the meeting on the 15th, at Marshall's suggestion, the conference was declared adjourned indefinitely. At the beginning of today's meeting, Molotov, in order to divert attention from the issue of compensation, requested that the other three foreign ministers agree to discuss the "German People's Congress" request that the Foreign Ministers' Conference allow them to listen to the opinions of the German delegation. The U.K., U.S., and France all stated that this request could not be accepted, so Marshall suggested resuming the discussion of the compensation issue. Marshall said: Regarding the compensation issue, we have obviously fallen into basic disagreements. The Soviet Union's demand for compensation of 10 billion yuan, calculated at 1938 prices, would reach 15 billion yuan at current prices, which is obviously contrary to the Potsdam Agreement and impossible in terms of practical economic principles. Under these demands, an agreement can only be reached if we agree to enslave the German people and seriously obstruct the recovery of the entire Europe. Regarding the Austrian treaty, it also failed to reach an agreement because the property rights and privileges required by the Soviet Union far exceeded what a free and independent Austria could fulfill. The Soviet Union has consistently refused to provide important and necessary information on the costs of transporting German reparations and has refused to agree to hand over German property unilaterally seized in the name of reparations. The Soviet Union's actions prevent Germany from playing its role in the task of rebuilding Europe and force the U.K. and the U.S. to heavily subsidize West Germany to maintain its survival. Unexpectedly, the Soviet representative accused the U.K. and the U.S. of attempting to use West Germany as a strategic base against European national unity and to promote expansionist policies. It should be known that if we stop this aid, the 400,000 Germans in the British and American zones will inevitably face collective starvation. In short, since the Soviet Union has unilaterally and firmly refused to agree, it would be futile and unprofitable to continue meetings to discuss other points. I advocate indefinite postponement of discussion. Bevin, after restating the United Kingdom's position in detail, also said, "History will be our witness. We must now doubt whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference can solve the problems of Europe and Germany after a long time." Molotov stated after Marshall's proposal for an indefinite postponement that Bevin Marshall's actions were obviously the same, both failed to invite the agenda, and both ignored the Soviet Union's suggestions, and the French delegation never objected to what the U.K. and the U.S. said, indicating that the U.K., U.S., and France had adopted a unified front to oppose reparations to the Soviet Union. Regarding the postponement proposal, this is another unilateral action. If the three delegations agree to an indefinite postponement, the Soviet Union will of course have to agree. However, the responsibility for this matter rests entirely with the other three delegations and has nothing to do with the Soviet Union.

### East and West Present a Divided Situation: Germany Becomes the Forefront of Diplomatic War; West German Federal Plan May Be Realized

[United Press, London, 16th] The breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has divided Germany, Europe, and the world into two halves. Of course, the failure of the conference did not completely shatter the ideal of "one world" during the war. However, the representatives of the Western countries unanimously believed that the relationship between the East and the West had deteriorated to the point where it could not be restored in the short term. Representatives of all countries were unwilling to predict what impact the failure of the conference would have on the world. It is questionable whether the four foreign ministers will be able to meet again. The divided Germany has become the "forefront of diplomatic war".

It is believed that although the U.K., U.S., and France may not take immediate action, the failure of the four foreign ministers to reach any agreement will inevitably lead to the following developments: France is expected to agree to unify its German occupation zone with the already merged British and American zones for economic purposes. The U.K., U.S., and France will accelerate discussions on politically unifying West Germany, which may lead to the establishment of a provisional West German government. The U.S., especially the U.S. Congress, will suddenly increase its support for the Marshall Plan.

[United Press, Frankfurt, 16th] An American observer predicted today that West Germany will soon begin to establish a provisional state or federation, which is a direct consequence of the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. German political leaders in the British and American zones have begun preparations to promote its realization. Representatives of the two major political parties in West Germany, the right-wing Christian Democratic Party and the left-wing Social Democratic Party, met here today to draft a concrete plan for organizing the government. It is expected that the task will be decided accordingly. According to a senior official of the Christian Democratic Party, as a result of the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, we have no choice but to proceed in this direction. The economic crisis in West Germany is important to relations in Western Europe, and our unity is necessary. Observers believe that the people of the British and American zones of Germany will be ordered to establish an inter-zonal economic conference, and the governors of the eight states are expected to submit a plan for the unification of West Germany to organize a limited central government.

### Saar Parliament Approves Agreement with France

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] The Saar Parliament unanimously passed all the terms of the agreement established with France on the 15th. Only one Communist member voted against it.

### International Committee Established in Paris: Actively Promoting the European Unity Movement; Members Include British, French, Dutch, and Belgian Nationalities

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] Four organizations promoting the European unity movement have formed the "International Committee of the European Unity Movement" to unify the steps of each organization in promoting the movement. The four organizations are the "French Committee for a United Europe" led by French Radical Party leader and National Assembly Speaker Herriot, the "United Europe Movement" led by British Conservative Party leader Churchill, the "European Cooperation and Independence League" led by former Belgian Prime Minister van Zeeland, and the "European Federalist Movement League" led by Brugmans. The International Committee was established in Paris over the weekend, chaired by Churchill's son-in-law Sanders of the "United Europe Movement", and the chief of staff of former Polish Prime Minister Pincowski, Reidinger, representing the "European Cooperation and Independence League", served as secretary-general. It plans to set up offices in London and Paris within two weeks. The participants in the International Committee are representatives of the aforementioned four organizations, including British, French, Dutch, Belgian, Swiss, and Polish nationalities. According to Sanders, chairman of the committee: "As each day passes, the need for European unity becomes more urgent. The establishment of this new institution allows us to move together, strengthen the effectiveness of our appeal, and strengthen the power of the movement we are promoting."

### U.S. Congress Responds Strongly, Advocating Reconstruction of Western Europe

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Due to the unhappiness of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, Congress here demanded that there should be a stronger West Germany and that the transportation of German industrial products to the Soviet Union should be stopped. Congressional leaders urged the U.K., U.S., and France to take sole responsibility for rebuilding Western Europe, but the door for Soviet participation is not closed if Soviet leaders can change their minds. Marshall is expected to return here on the 19th to report to President Truman and the people on the London Conference, at which time Congress will ask him the question of "how should we proceed from now on". Vandenberg has not immediately commented on the breakdown of the London Conference, but Senator Connally pointed out that the world cannot wait forever for a compromise between East and West. He suggested that now is the time for the Western countries to decide the future destiny of Germany and Austria in their occupation zones.

Senator Smith, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is also one of the advocates of the West German group. Congressman Ferguson said that the failure of the London Conference makes it necessary for the United States to reconsider its position on the issue of Soviet reparations.

### Five Moderate Leftists Enter the Cabinet: The Italian Government Broadens Its Base; Assembling Forces to Resist Communist Forces

[Reuters, Rome, 15th] It was officially announced here today that the Gasperi Cabinet has expanded its base, with Republican Party leader Bachiati and Right-wing Socialist Party leader Saragat joining the cabinet as deputy prime ministers, assisting Gasperi together with incumbent Deputy Prime Minister Ainoti.

[United Press, Chicago, 16th] U.S. Representative to the United Nations Austin said in a speech to the American Farm Alliance today that the Soviet Union's propaganda campaign against the Marshall Plan for European revival has not only failed to damage it in the slightest, but has actually given it support. The recent strikes in France and Italy are part of the Soviet Union's anti-Marshall Plan movement, and the results have also ended in failure.

### Japan Attempts to Break Free from Control: Become a Member of the United Nations; Sato and Others Actually Sing Praises of Trusteeship Not Being Applicable

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Two Japanese diplomats today, in promoting Japan's joining the United Nations movement, first directly opposed MacArthur's proposed United Nations trusteeship plan for Japan. One is former Foreign Minister Sato and the other is former Minister to the Vatican Harada. It is said that trusteeship is not applicable to Japan. As far as the Japanese are concerned, if a control mechanism is needed after the establishment of the peace treaty, it is better to be jointly supervised by the Far Eastern Commission countries than to be jointly supervised by the United Nations. These remarks were made by the two at a press conference of the Japan United Nations Comrades Association Preparation Committee. The association is scheduled to be established on the 17th to educate the Japanese about the goals of the institution. Sato serves as the president and Harada serves as the secretary-general. Members include diplomats and professors. The association plans to quickly promote Japan's membership in the United Nations after the peace treaty is signed. Sato said that if the Allied countries are satisfied with Japan's implementation of the control policy, Japan's accession to the United Nations can be realized within two or three years. According to the new constitution, Japan must rely on the protection of the United Nations and even be subject to its control. Sato is recognized as the first-class diplomat in Japan today and is currently the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate. Sato was the last Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, so he is also considered to be Japan's Soviet Union expert. Harada served in the Secretariat of the old League of Nations for 19 years.

### Japanese Government and People Oppose Economic Reform: Making Political Reform Meaningless

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] The American Vanguard Forum commented on the various reforms in Japan in an editorial today, pointing out the important differences between political reform and economic reform. Japanese officials immediately accepted political reform, while economic reform was reluctantly agreed to "almost under the threat of American bayonets". The newspaper pointed out this difference in order to propose to those who believe that a revolution of thought has taken place in Japan overnight. The newspaper said: Not only conservative and stubborn people oppose economic reform, but also those who claim to be liberals and socialists. The legislation on commerce and industry passed by the Japanese parliament recently under MacArthur's order can prove this. This legislation is extremely difficult to implement outside the efforts of the U.S. military headquarters, so economic reform can only be implemented on paper, and the actual results are often poor. The most obvious example is the land reform industry law. Although it has been passed, the industry obtained from the landlords (who strongly support Japanese militarism) and handed over to the farmers is not much. The newspaper concluded by saying: The reason why most Japanese officials apparently agree to adopt political reform and oppose economic reform is that they are extremely opposed to any kind of reform of Japan in the past (that is, the Japan jointly ruled by militarists, semi-feudal landlords, and capitalists engaged in monopolies). These officials can accept the political reforms proposed and implemented by MacArthur and pretend to cooperate on the surface, but they can undermine them secretly by opposing economic reforms, making political reforms meaningless. They recognize that without economic reform, political reform is meaningless.

### Romanian Government Takes Over British Oil Company

[United Press, Budapest, 15th] The Romanian government today took over two major oil companies in the country controlled by British people. The Romanian government also promulgated a decree, announcing this motive, and accusing the Royal Dutch Shell Company and Phoenix Oil and Transportation Company run by British people of "having malicious intentions, inefficient production, and stealing oil from the government's soil layers."

### France Struggles to Recover (Part 1)

— Our Paris Correspondent, Yi Ruo

I.

[Our Paris Dispatch] Since the nationwide local elections in France in October, the political situation has formed a three-way standoff. De Gaulle and the Communists are irreconcilable; the Communists are unwilling to compromise with the current cabinet; and the cabinet and De Gaulle are not on good terms. Their strengths are evenly matched, and none is willing to show weakness, so none can control the overall situation. This has caused widespread anxiety, soaring prices, an unstable franc, and rising labor unrest. Ramadier searched everywhere for a successor for a month (since October 20th), and they remained in a stalemate, with no one able to break the deadlock.

Based on the results of this election, the supporters of De Gaulle are the most numerous, followed by the supporters of the Communists, but their vote count has not decreased, so the two have become formidable rivals, each unwilling to yield to the other. Both are in the opposition and want to overthrow Ramadier and replace him. However, with Ramadier squeezed in the middle, it is not easy to overthrow him. Ramadier is taking advantage of the discord between the left and the right to unite the four ruling parties to resist the political pressure from both sides. These four ruling parties are: the Socialist Party, which suffers defeats in every election; the Popular Republican Movement, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the election; the Social Radical Party, which has declined sharply; and the Republican Independent Party, which has no presence. This third combination formed by these four parties has more than 300 votes in parliament, which is enough to maintain Ramadier's position (the anti-Ramadier Communists only have 184 votes), because a vote of confidence in the new cabinet must pass an absolute majority in parliament—309 votes—to be effective. Ramadier is short of these nine votes, so his power appears weak and he is facing a shared fate of riding in the same boat. A slight carelessness could easily lead to his downfall.

De Gaulle's first attempt at electioneering showed a little promise, alarming the British and Americans and causing unease among the French authorities. The third combination was quickly formed to resist the dictatorial atmosphere brought by De Gaulle and to avoid the terror of a civil war that would occur if the left and right were to come into direct conflict. The purpose of this election was to replace local councilors and mayors in various regions and did not affect the organization of parliament. Therefore, although the De Gaulle faction won a majority of local seats in 52 of the 92 provinces nationwide, its strength in parliament is limited. Before the election, it only had nine seats. Before the election, more than thirty members jumped out of the Popular Republican Movement and favored De Gaulle, and the left-wing alliance had thirty people taking the same attitude, adding up to only seventy-two seats. In the total of six hundred and eighteen seats, it cannot play a significant role. Therefore, when De Gaulle hosted foreign journalists the other day, he brought out his proposal to re-elect the parliament. Unfortunately, he is in a country ruled by law, and a general's order cannot casually command the parliament. According to legal regulations, members of parliament have a four-year term, and three years must pass before the term expires. According to past history, France never easily dissolves parliament unless there is a special situation. In the past eighty years, it has only been dissolved once, unlike the British Parliament, whose term is set at seven years, but it is rare for it to sit until the end of its term. This is a huge difference between the British and French constitutional systems, and general jurists use this to show off, saying that British administration is higher than legislative power, and French legislative power is higher than administrative power. They speak with relish, while the listeners are at a loss. In fact, habit is better than human power, and our military power is better than civil power, isn't that also passed down from history?

The issue of re-electing the parliament can only be postponed, but the three-legged political situation is indeed not easy to support. The two parties in the opposition are stirring up trouble, and the ruling parties are really struggling to cope. This pillar in the middle cannot withstand the shocking waves. This is the symbol of the current French political situation.

II.

The turbulent labor unrest can illustrate the precariousness of the French political situation. First, regarding the wage issue, since Ramadier took office at the beginning of the year, wages have been frozen, hoping that the devaluation policy would be realized and the two would be harmonized so that society could be stable and prosperous. Who knew that after three months, prices failed to decrease by three percent, and after another two months, they increased by ten percent, while wages remained frozen. The General Confederation of Labor weakly proposed a production bonus as a remedy, but it was not adopted. The Communist Party took the opportunity to withdraw from the cabinet to preserve its strength in the labor sector. In May and June, labor unrest broke out once. Prices continued to rise, and Ramadier allowed wages to be adjusted again in July, but then pushed it back to December. Jequier could not stand it any longer and automatically signed a labor-management agreement with the labor side, jointly resolving to increase wages by more than 11% (small wages can be increased to 42% to meet the minimum living cost of 8,000 francs per month). Who knew that after the government received this agreement, it was still hesitant and delayed for a whole month in August, and finally rejected it. Prices continued to rise, exceeding 40% of the beginning of the year. At this time, the salaried class was really out of breath. The General Confederation of Labor recently proposed a request to "increase wages by 25%" to meet the "minimum living cost of 10,800 francs per month," which of course had no response. So on the morning of November 19th, more than 100,000 coal miners in northern France refused to go down to mine coal, more than 100,000 dockworkers in Marseille no longer cared about loading and unloading goods, and more than 100,000 ironworkers in Paris did not go to forge iron. The wave of strikes was launched simultaneously across the country. Ramadier was under great pressure and saw that he really could not suppress it, so he began to retreat.

Since the election in October, the left and right wings in the opposition have received far more votes than all the parties in the ruling coalition. It is undeniable that Ramadier's prestige has declined. The ruling Popular Republican Movement wanted to recover from the wounds of the disastrous election and proposed to reorganize a strong government to replace the weak and incompetent Ramadier. The first to stir up the cabinet unrest was Le Cour, a spokesman for the party, who made this proposal to the President. The Left Wing Alliance has never approved of the government's "controlled economy" and has long wanted to change its taste. The leader of the alliance, Herriot, as the speaker of the National Assembly, wanted to bring out Le Noux, a member of the Moderate Party, to change the situation, to moderate the polarization of the left and right, and at the same time, with his financial management skills, stabilize the franc and perhaps stabilize prices. The ruling Socialist Party, although it suffers defeats in every election, always wants to be all things to all people and get some benefits. Although Ramadier is incompetent, he considers himself indispensable. In August, when the Socialist Party Congress gathered in Lyon, it was observed that Ramadier was not very energetic, and it decided on several new guidelines, but unfortunately, things have changed, and the decision was not implemented. After this general election, the Central Executive Committee of the party discussed countermeasures, preparing for Leon to succeed when Ramadier could not hold on, so that the premiership would still be hosted by the Socialist Party and would not fall into the hands of outsiders. Therefore, Leon and Le Noux seemed to be the masters of the future cabinet and immediately began to consult the opinions of various parties, visited the President, and reported the progress at any time. France has since entered a turbulent and uneasy situation, and until the afternoon of November 19th, it was constantly exploring and seeking a way out to break the deadlock. Who knew that something had happened at noon?

III.

The morning of November 19th: 300,000 workers in France began to strike. At noon, the Anglo-American Press Association hosted a banquet for the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Mollet, and asked him to express his views on French domestic affairs. It is said that Ramadier will soon leave his cabinet position, and his successor will be Leon. This thunderous statement caused a surge in the turbulent political situation. Upon hearing this, Le Noux immediately terminated his consultations. The Popular Republican Movement in Parliament was greatly surprised. The Left Wing Alliance believed that such a Socialist Party government, which only changed the soup but not the medicine, would not help the actual situation. The most surprised were the Socialist Party members, because they had not yet learned that the previous night (the 18th), Ramadier had encountered a snag in the Socialist Party cadre, and those who supported his policies had become a minority, and they did not know that Mollet had arbitrarily announced the "secret" of the party without their consent, which they felt was really inappropriate. Especially Ramadier himself, was somewhat unable to hold back his anger. On the one hand, he was regarded as a mere placeholder, and on the other hand, he was directly told of his end. Out of anger, he finally went to the President at 9 p.m. that night and submitted his resignation. The French cabinet unrest began from there.

### Rice Rationing Implemented Today Nationwide, Each Household Receives a Certificate for Purchase

Social Bureau Orders Rice Shops to Report Transaction Amounts for Reference, Grain Stocked Along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and Central Trust Bureau's Foreign Rice Rushed to Shanghai

[Reported by Our Newspaper] City officials believe that the recent rise in rice prices in the city is of great importance to the people's livelihood and have decided to implement a full rationing system from today onwards to suppress rice prices. To this end, Mayor Wu also hosted reporters in the City Hall auditorium at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, reporting four points: Due to the recent sudden rise in rice prices, the municipal government, in order to take care of poor households, has decided to implement the second phase of benefit rice distribution throughout the city. There are a total of 30 districts in the city, and 7 districts have already implemented rice distribution. The remaining 23 districts will all be rationed from the 17th, with a total of more than 110,000 dan. The rice distribution system for factory workers will continue to be implemented. There are more than 700,000 groups of miscellaneous grains stored on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications and President Zhang of the Executive Yuan have agreed to rush them to Shanghai in the short term. On the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line, the two railway directors, Chen Bozhuang, have agreed to transport more than 10,000 shi of rice to Shanghai every day. The Central Trust Bureau will be able to transport 300,000 dan of 　Luo rice to Shanghai by the end of this month, at which time the amount of rice rationed in the city is expected to increase. In addition, in order to control rice prices, the municipal government has decided to implement a full rationing system and massively sell rice, similar to the cotton yarn disposal method, so as to suppress rice prices.

According to city government sources, the Municipal Standing Committee has decided to implement a full rice rationing system and has ordered the Social Bureau to follow the Public Utility Bureau's current method of issuing gasoline purchase certificates, with one certificate per household, stating the name and address and listing the number for purchasing rice. The area and quantity are not limited for the time being, but the purchasing merchants must record each purchaser one by one with the certificate for reference. After the foundation of this method is established, a quantitative distribution system will be implemented, with grain allocated according to the population. After receiving the order, the Social Bureau has been actively preparing and has instructed the rice shops to fill in the number of shi of japonica rice, indica rice, and glutinous rice sold and purchased in the past three months and their sources for reference. The Social Bureau will also convene responsible persons from each rice shop in each district for talks.

[Further News] Rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Tai Koo Company's Niuzhuang wheel, which transported 2,300 tons of rice from Manggok, arrived in Shanghai last Saturday and is currently being unloaded. The company's Nanchang wheel also transported 2,400 tons of rice from Bangkok and is expected to arrive today.

### Year-End Bonus Issue: Labor and Management Disagree, Representatives from the General Confederation of Labor and the Industrial Association Go to the Social Bureau to State Their Reasons

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Representatives from the General Confederation of Labor, Shui Xiangyun, Zhang Zhusan, Liang Yongzhang, Ye Xianggao, etc., went to the Social Bureau yesterday morning to state their opinions on the year-end bonus issue, requesting the implementation of the government's decision. They also said that if the management wants to issue the bonus in installments, they must obtain the consent of the labor side. When the representatives arrived at the bureau, it happened that representatives from the Industrial Association, Wu Yun Chu, Tian Heqing, Yan Yaoqiu, Ye Fu Kang, etc., also went to the Social Bureau to visit Director Wu for this issue. The Industrial Association believes that the year-end bonus is stipulated to be one month's salary in principle, and most factories are unable to bear it. Even if they can afford it, they are unable to pay it in one lump sum and must pay it in installments. At that time, Director Wu was receiving other visitors, so the representatives of both sides exchanged opinions in the reception room first. When Director Wu received them, they each stated their reasons. The representatives of the Industrial Association believe that the amount of the year-end bonus issued by each factory is too large, and the funds in the market may be insufficient. They wondered whether they could use the factory's products, discounted according to the wholesale price, as part of the bonus to be issued. Director Wu believes that this method is very good, but the products should only refer to the daily necessities needed by the workers. It will be submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion. In addition, the provision that workers must not strike or go slow during the process of handling year-end bonus disputes will also be submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion. Director Wu said that if the management is indeed in difficulty, labor and management can negotiate on their own and are not subject to the one-month salary restriction.

Wu Yun Chu, Tian Heji, and other five people from the Industrial Association also visited Mayor Wu yesterday and made a statement on the year-end bonus issue. The mayor was unable to meet with them because he was attending the 75th anniversary celebration of the China Merchants Bureau and agreed to go again today.

### Two Party Senators Register, Temporarily Relying on Party Headquarters' Certificate

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Regarding the registration of the 36 senators from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Young China Party in this city who were properly determined by the central government, because the certificate determined by the national government has not yet been issued, the Central Party Headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Secretariat of the Senate have agreed to temporarily rely on the certificate from the headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party to go through the registration procedures first, so as not to affect the nomination for participation in the election of supervisors. It is said that the Young China Party will also take the same approach.

### Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe Tours South, Song Ziwen Sends a Telegram of Welcome

### Overseas Chinese Leader Li Zhaohuan Talks About the Situation of Overseas Chinese

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Li Zhaohuan, a Chinese leader in Boston, USA, has a long-standing reputation for running businesses in that city. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he called on patriotic Chinese in the United States to establish the New England Aid China Committee and spared no effort in donating. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Li contacted responsible persons in the US government and promoted the establishment of the US government's Training Committee for Chinese Technical Personnel, with more than 2,000 trainees. This time, the United States sent more than 100 business representatives to Japan to investigate, and Li was also among them, becoming the first Chinese to serve as a US business representative. Li recently went to Japan and passed through Shanghai, staying for a short time. A reporter interviewed him yesterday, and according to him: "Overseas Chinese have great potential in business in various places, but they still lack contact. Most overseas Chinese are willing to establish factories in the motherland and are willing to raise funds themselves to hire management and technical personnel. Overseas Chinese in the United States alone remitted 70 million US dollars last year, not including the travel vouchers and cash brought by returning overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia also remit a lot. However, under the current foreign management system, there are great difficulties in both overseas remittances and investment. I sincerely hope that the government can make reasonable amendments."

### Spot Check on Gold and Cash Transactions, Xiangtai Bank Suspected

### Major Smuggling Case at the Customs House Initially Investigated in Nanjing, Mao Fengxiang Confesses That Lu Genquan's Foreign Exchange Source Was Problematic, Investigation Reveals That the Loot Was Distributed Mostly in US Dollars

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, November 16] Yin Lansun and 12 other criminals involved in the major smuggling case involving collusion between officials and merchants at the Shanghai Customs House were escorted to Nanjing and transferred to the Capital District Court along with documents and stolen goods on the 16th. The handling prosecutor, Tian Jihou, opened the court at about 5 p.m. and conducted a strict interrogation on the most serious Lu Genji case for more than two hours. The key to solving this case was that Lu Genquan of Lu Genji contacted the staff of the Security Bureau after receiving the notice of bribery and used 1.46 billion legal currency as bait to lure them into the trap, and then tracked down the case. The distribution of the spoils in the Lu case was as follows: Yin Lansun (Director of the Import Permit Verification Section of the Jianghai Customs House) US$1,500. Yue Xinmin (Assistant) US$1,700, plus US$1,300 pocketed. Zhang Baohui (Assistant) US$1,500. Zhang Yuan (who used to work at the Customs House and was the Shanghai representative of Isha) US$2,000, plus intermediary merchant Mei Futang US$200 and 12.9 million legal currency. Zhang Gaozhen US$300 and 12.9 million legal currency, plus US$100 for expenses and US$100 pocketed. Shen Yanlu US$300 and 12.9 million legal currency for the first time, US$680 and 70 million legal currency for the second time, plus US$1,000 pocketed. Fang Maolin US$680, plus 200 million legal currency pocketed. Related person Mao Fengxiang intercepted 20 tons of galvanized iron, and Jiang Baoliang intercepted 10 tons of galvanized iron. The absconding reporting merchants Guo Ziming and Bu Jiazhen each received US$300 and 12.9 million legal currency. As for Mao Runxiang, Yang Shude, and Chen Lianggang, they only participated in running errands and did not share the spoils. It is learned that Mao Fengxiang stated in his original confession that when he contacted both parties, Lu Genquan complained that the foreign exchange used for purchasing 400 tons of galvanized iron cost 100 million yuan, which was obtained from the Bank of China, and the source was also problematic. He asked the court to investigate the case, which may lead to unexpected complications.

### Coal Merchant Kidnapped in Wuxi, Accomplices Arrested and Principal Culprit Identified

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yu Xingquan, 48 years old, from Wuxi, opened Heji Coal Shop at No. 725 Tanggu Road. Last month, Yu Ding, 10, was engaged in his hometown, and Yu and his wife returned to the Yu family home in Dongwan, Wuxi to host a banquet for guests. On the afternoon of the 14th, at 8 p.m., three robbers suddenly came, one holding a submachine gun and the other holding a revolver, posing as detectives and kidnapped Yu. In the darkness, they walked about five or six miles to a place. The robbers clapped their hands as a signal, and one person walked out of the shed to help escort Yu in, saying, "I am the leader of the Communist Economic Group." He said that Yu had 50 gold bars, which were essential. Yu replied that he did not have such a large amount of money and was locked in the shed. At about 11 a.m. the next day, the robbers finally agreed with Yu to take 100 million yuan. Yu gave a telephone number for Heji Coal Shop, and the robbers released him. The two parties agreed to use the words "Dangxi" as the code when collecting the money. The robbers then sent a person to accompany Yu on foot to Luoshe, took a car to his home in Wuxi, and safely returned to Shanghai on the 17th. At noon on the 20th, Yu received a call from the robbers, saying that they were in Room 76 of the Dahua Hotel on Ninghai East Road and ordered Yu to put a large amount of money into a sack and send it over. Yu personally carried 100 million yuan in cash, divided into two sacks, and sent it over. He met a thin robber, checked that everything was correct, shook hands and said goodbye. However, this case has been known to the North Railway Station Police Sub-bureau, knowing that a resident within its jurisdiction was kidnapped in another port, it immediately began to investigate. After more than ten days, it was learned that the accomplices were hiding in Room 1, 3rd Floor, No. 45 Julu Road. Sub-bureau Chief Ying Zhichun ordered Squad Leader Wang Shou and squad members Bei Bin, Chen Yifei, and Sun Shanggeng, 　Officer Zheng Jingren, and others to go to the scene and arrest four people, Zhang Heng, Lin Aizhen (a Metropolitan dancer), Liu Boliang, and Shen Juxing, and bring them back to the bureau for questioning. According to Zhang, he used to be a battalion commander of the guerrillas and once led military agencies to appease the bandits, but because he failed to complete his mission, he was detained by the authorities and released on the 14th of last month. Yu was a friend and after Yu was kidnapped, at the request of Yu's wife, he had tried to rescue him. Later, after investigating Liu and Shen, it was learned that the mastermind of the case was Feng Boming. Zhang sent a letter to Feng, which Liu and Shen took to 　to release him, so the bandits negotiated directly with the hostage and resolved the matter with 100 million yuan. Liu and Shen confessed to having helped run errands and received 9 million yuan. They also confessed that there were two guns, which Lin Aizhen brought from Shanghai to Wuxi, one hidden at the foot of Meiyuan Mountain and the other under Huiquan Mountain. Squad Leader Wang ordered squad member Chen Yifei, staff Tang Mubing, Liu Mingjia, Huang Weisheng, and Ding Fanglong to disguise themselves and go to Wuxi to retrieve them and bring them back to Shanghai for filing. The absconding mastermind, Feng Boming, is still being pursued.

### Doctor and Son Busted for Manufacturing Toxic Powder

Secret Chamber Found Under Floorboards - Large Quantities of White Powder Raw Materials and Tools Seized - Unlawful Manager of Da Hu Pharmacy Also Arrested

[Report from our newspaper] Yang Jian, a native of Pudong, was secretly manufacturing white powder narcotics in a disguised Chinese medicine clinic on the fourth floor of No. 14 Huangpi South Road. The matter was discovered by the judicial section of the Songshan Police Sub-bureau, and officer Tan Delin, along with police chief Ma Jun, police officer Chen Junfeng, and others, went there at 1 a.m. on the 12th, feigning illness to seek medical treatment. Mr. Yang opened the door, and the police officers began their operation. They heard rustling sounds from inside a room, but the door was tightly closed. When questioned, Yang claimed that his wife, Xue Youzhen, was "relieving herself". The officers waited for a long time before the door opened, and Yang's wife looked visibly panicked. The officers searched the area and found a wide gap in the floorboards. They lifted it and saw a staircase leading down. Descending the stairs, they found two basins on the floor, containing twenty-two packages of white powder of varying sizes, as well as six taels, eight maces, and four and a half candareens of raw materials for manufacturing, placed on sieves and other tools. The officers took the narcotics, tools, and the Yang Jian couple to the bureau. After interrogation, they confessed that the raw materials for other narcotics were purchased by Yang's father, Hanqing, from Da Hu Pharmacy at No. 278 Fuzhou Road. Thereupon, another investigating officer arrested Yang's father and escorted him to Da Hu Pharmacy to purchase two pounds of the material. Subsequently, the pharmacy's manager, Huang Quifeng (a Ningbo native, 28 years old), was arrested, and eight pounds of the material were found and confiscated. After being taken to the bureau, section chief Rong combined the cases for investigation, and they will be transferred to the court for strict prosecution soon.

### Guarantor Xiao Hanmin Detained

[Report from our newspaper] The Direct Taxation Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Finance stating that Huang, a Shanghai Municipal Councilor, reported that Liu Mancheng and Huang Ruizhi, auditors of the bureau, discovered discrepancies between the reported figures and the actual figures of goods in and out of the China-Europe Sugar Factory when they were sent to audit the factory. They then intimidated the factory with fines. Subsequently, the factory's accountant arranged for Liu and Huang to meet at Guanshengyuan, where they agreed on a bribe of 20 million yuan. Huang Zude, director of the bureau, ordered specialist Shao Weizu to investigate. According to the investigation report, although the defendants denied soliciting bribes, they delayed the audit report for five days against regulations, raising suspicions of malpractice. The bureau first dismissed Liu and Huang and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The two defendants repeatedly failed to appear in court, so the guarantors were summoned for questioning yesterday. Huang's guarantor, Chen Zubao, owner of Zhengda Printing Press, claimed that Huang had died of illness on November 21st, and presented a telegram as proof. The prosecutor was highly suspicious of this. Liu's guarantors were Zhao Xuetao and Xiao Hanmin. Zhao was released on bail, and Xiao was detained and given a deadline to produce the defendant Liu Mancheng before he could be released.

### Navigation Administration Takes Over Water Management Rights - Striking Pilots Join the Public Association - New Standards Set for Collection of Fees

[Report from our newspaper] The water management rights for the Shanghai area were transferred from the Customs to the Navigation Administration yesterday. The Navigation Administration has established a Water Pilotage Section, headed by Huang Xichou. However, the actual work will be entrusted to the Tongsha Pilot Association, which has set up an office at Room 407, Li Han Building, Fuzhou Road.

The twenty-two Customs pilots who had their licenses revoked due to the strike, except for one who has left China, have all joined the Tongsha Pilot Association and resumed work. The remaining nineteen foreign pilots and two Chinese pilots. Englishman Chilton and Chinese Zhu Zhe remain as the chief and assistant managers of the new association. Among the original eighteen Chinese pilots in the Tongsha Pilot Association, Jin Yueshi, Qin Zhengru, Ji Zenggan, and Li Yunqu have begun work. Two others have less experience and have been granted internship positions. The remaining twelve have not yet participated due to other jobs or insufficient experience. As for the White Russian pilots temporarily employed by the Customs, they will be retained until the end of the year. Therefore, the current number of pilots has increased compared to when the Customs managed them, and shipping in the city can proceed smoothly.

The collection of water pilotage fees has been revised by the Navigation Administration with new standards and has been notified to all shipping companies for payment. The calculation method is quite complicated. Roughly speaking, the fee for a 10,000-ton vessel with a draft of 26 feet traveling from Tongsha to Shanghai is 54 million yuan. This standard is adjusted every week based on actual conditions. The income of the pilots is based on a proportional sharing of the total monthly income of the association. The number of ships entering and leaving varies, so the amount is not fixed. The original US$500 previously paid to foreign pilots at the official rate has been cancelled, and all payments are made in national currency. However, under the new fee standards, their income is still expected to increase by about 20%.

### Repatriated Residents from South Sakhalin Face Housing Problems Again

Chen Yingjing, Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday afternoon and stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now needs the building and requested that the group of repatriated residents be moved out. Director Wu stated that he would need to consult the Mayor.

According to Director Wu, these repatriated residents have been registered, and those who wish to return to their hometowns will be given a partial travel allowance. Those who wish to work in Shanghai will be assisted as much as possible. Some of the Fujian residents wish to work in Taiwan, but it is necessary to first contact Taiwan to determine what skills they possess and whether Taiwan needs them.

### Winter Relief West Side Charity Performance - Charity Sale Tonight - Honorary Tickets

[Report from our newspaper] The winter relief charity screening for the west side will be held tonight at 9:00 PM at the Great Light Cinema. Around 1,800 distinguished guests from various countries' diplomatic missions in Shanghai, as well as local Party, government, military, and Chinese and foreign business leaders, have been invited to attend, and will enter with their invitations without exchanging tickets.

### Sir Sassoon Donates 25 Million

[Report from our newspaper] The case of the Shanghai office of the National Panyang Textile Factory using the name of the Northeast Branch of the Resources Commission to privately transport a large quantity of dyes from Panyang to Shanghai is currently being tried in the local court. The details of the case are gradually becoming clear, involving Zhu Zemin, manager of the Panyang Textile Factory, Chen Keming, deputy manager, and Zhu Zemin's younger brother Zhu Tingyang (who works at the Material Supply Office of the Resources Commission's Northeast Branch). The Zhus colluded to use the seals of the Material Supply Office of the Resources Commission's Northeast Branch and Zhu Tingyang used the official letter of the branch to request the allocation of aircraft for transportation. On the 27th of last month, eight aircraft flew from Panyang to Peiping. At the Peiping Airport, one of the aircraft had a malfunction, unloading 43 barrels of dye. On the 28th, the aircraft flew to Nanking, and on the 29th, they arrived in Shanghai. Jiangwan Airport saw that the goods belonged to the Resources Commission and telegraphed the Shanghai office of the commission, which sent a vehicle to transport the goods. After hearing the news, the Shanghai office of the National Panyang Textile Factory panicked and sent its staff Chen Shanmin to negotiate the return of the goods, claiming that the dyes were transported to Shanghai for the purpose of opening the Shenjiang Textile Factory. The Shanghai office of the Resources Commission, seeing that they were using the Resources Commission's name for private gain and that the circumstances of malpractice were obvious, requested the police bureau to arrest Liu Tianhong and others and transfer them to the criminal division of the local court for trial. However, according to a letter from the Executive Yuan Air Transport Brigade, the brigade did not have any aircraft loading any goods in Qingyang, and the brigade's aircraft all took off and landed at Hongqiao Airport, so the so-called eight aircraft must belong to another aviation agency.

### Horse Dealer's Home Robbery and Resistance Case Solved - Three Thousand Strong Bandit with Devoted Followers Finally Captured

[Report from our newspaper] On the evening of the 21st of last month, around 6 p.m., a robbery occurred at the home of Mr. Ma Boluo, manager of the American Palm Olive Soap Company, at No. 326 Fan Yu Road. A total of six bandits came, and Director Shao of the Changmi Police Sub-bureau personally supervised section chief Shi Jieren, officer Wei Jinquan, and more than eighty police officers, militia police, and security police to surround the area and fight the bandits. One bandit (Wang A'er) was killed on the spot. After investigation, it was learned that the ringleader of this gang was Zhang Jipin, also known as Little Jipin, a native of Xinjiang, 42 years old, with more than three thousand followers under his command, and famous among the bandit parties. Knowing that Ma's residence contained a large amount of U.S. dollars and two five-carat diamond rings, he coveted the wealth. The day before, Zhang gathered his associates in the Wenmiao Garden to plan the robbery. The next afternoon, around 4 p.m., Zhang first arrived at a small teahouse nearby to wait. All the firearms were transported by the deceased bandit Wang A'er to the alley next door to Ma's residence, where they were distributed to the bandits. They took advantage of the return of Ma's second son, Ma Shiwei, from school at 6 p.m. to follow him into the house and carry out the robbery, leading to a major struggle. According to Wang A'er's fingerprints, the sub-bureau discovered that the bandit had committed two previous crimes

In the files, Wang's younger brother, Wang Zhaojing, resided at No. 200 Chengxing Lane, which was found to be No. 86 Dianchang Lane, Caojiadu, the address of Wang A'er's mother-in-law. After visiting and investigating, it was learned that Wang A'er's family resided at No. 27 Xindu Ferry, Zhongshan North Road. Wang's wife, Wang Liu Xiuzhen, was taken to the bureau for questioning. She stated that recently Li Jingguo, who lives at No. 18 Sanguantang Road in the South City, had come twice and was now working as a ticket collector at the Longmen Grand Theater. Li was brought to the bureau,

Under Strict Interrogation

Learned that there was another fierce bandit named Lv Jie, nicknamed Little Gun, a native of Yancheng, living at No. 18 Yingpan Bridge, Gonghe New Road, Zhabei. He was subsequently arrested and confessed that the leader Zhang Jipin and his accomplice Chen Jiehua (i.e., Baogen) were hiding upstairs in Mo's Motor Shop at No. 23 Haining Road. When they moved to arrest them, they had already fled to Gaomiao in Pudong. The next day, the criminal Chen was captured and confessed that all the firearms were in Lv Jie's home. According to the confession, five Mauser pistols and box cannons were found. He also confessed that the six-inch Mauser pistol was robbed on October 4 when they robbed Ni Baochang's house at No. 7 Dexing Lane, Sanjiao Street, Lujiabang Road in the South City. On the 17th of the same month, they robbed the Xielong Rice Shop at No. 53 Fushentang Street in the South City.

The losses of the above two households

Was extremely great. Director Shao Yuanbin of the sub-bureau, because the principal offender Zhang Jipin was at large, ordered section chief Shi to send police to investigate. It was learned that Zhang sometimes lived with his sister in Caojiadu, and sometimes at his concubine's place at No. 13 Ziti Road, Xiaonanmen. His legal wife lived in Panpu, a rural village in Cixi. On the 8th, section chief Shi led police chief Li Wenbin and officers Gu Kunqi and Wang Jianhua to travel there by boat, but they had already fled to Ningbo. The police followed them to Ningbo, and learned that they had returned to Shanghai. After returning to Shanghai, they learned that Zhang was staying in a certain room in the Mengyuan Hotel. They first arrested his follower Jin Heshang and took him to

The Hotel to Capture Him

Learned that Zhang had left. According to Jin Heshang, Zhang was trying to avoid arrest and did not want to stay in Shanghai for long, intending to flee to Hong Kong temporarily. He had asked Jin to tell his brother-in-law to collect money at his sister's house in Caojiadu at 1 p.m. on the 14th and send it to a pawnshop at No. 204 Lane, Wusong Road. Section chief Shi and officer Wei went there and finally arrested him. The criminal Zhang confessed to committing dozens of cases, which he could not remember all at once. Subsequently, a large number of stolen goods were recovered, including more than twenty taels of gold bars, jade rings, fox fur coats, gray back coats, etc. He is currently under strict interrogation.

### Lou Guowei Suspected of Embezzlement - Reported by Two Money Exchanges

[Report from our newspaper] The District Procuratorate opened a court yesterday to investigate the case of former Direct Taxation Bureau Director Lou Guowei being accused of embezzlement. Chen Mingsheng, Li Zumian, Tang Qin, and Dai Yun, four staff members of the bureau, were summoned. Except for Dai Yun, who did not appear, the others attended the court to testify. The main focus of yesterday's interrogation was whether there were any malpractices in the bureau's collection of profit taxes for the 35th year and the liquidation of financial institutions. Since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, more than 300 banks and money exchanges in the city related to the enemy and puppet regimes were ordered to close. However, these institutions still needed to pay a large amount of back taxes, which were handled by the Direct Taxation Bureau. Several staff members of the bureau took the opportunity to nitpick and extort money. In the case of the Wuzhou and Jiu'an money exchanges, because negotiations failed, the tax payments were increased to more than 200 times the original amount. The managers of the two money exchanges, believing that the bureau was engaged in extortion and embezzlement, filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate against Lou Guowei, the former director of the bureau, and Wang Mingyi, the section chief. Chen Mingsheng and others who were summoned yesterday were involved in the case and were ordered to return after the interrogation.

### Comprehensive Suppression in Jiangnan - Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province Delivers Important Radio Address

[Report from our newspaper from Zhenjiang on the 14th] With the commencement of the comprehensive suppression of bandits in Jiangnan, Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province has delivered a radio address of great significance to the 34 million people of the province, as well as the commissioners, county magistrates, and all levels of civil and military personnel. An excerpt is as follows:

This comprehensive suppression in Jiangnan is a struggle for survival with the Communist bandits. It is to ensure the peace of all people and to achieve lasting tranquility. We have an extremely firm confidence in completing this task. At the same time, our province is adjacent to the capital, and eliminating the Communist bandits to protect the capital is our responsibility as people of Jiangsu.

Now, I will explain our understanding and tasks during the comprehensive suppression in Jiangnan separately: Commissioners, County Magistrates,

Commissioners, County Magistrates,

All levels of Civil and Military Personnel:

During the suppression period, the county magistrate must constantly go to the countryside to convene meetings of district, township, and baojia chiefs to complete three tasks: (1) suppressing bandits, (2) organizing various people's self-defense forces, and (3) supervising grain collection. All tasks must be completed within the time limit.

The joint defense between counties and between villages and towns must be effectively organized, with frequent joint patrols and guard duty. Every village and town must be guarded day and night by people's self-defense forces taking turns on duty. Special attention must be paid to the night, dusk, and dawn to prevent the bandits from passing through or gathering secretly. Each village should prepare watch drums and gongs for nightly patrols. If traces of bandits are discovered, the gongs must be sounded immediately to raise the alarm, and the people must rise up to fight the bandits. Neighboring villages must help each other and encircle the bandits to prevent them from escaping.

Each county must value the strength of the people's self-defense organizations. They should follow the "Regulations on the Organization and Training of People's Self-Defense Forces" issued by the central government, adhering to the principles of "soldiers not leaving their weapons, weapons not leaving the village, local officials selected locally, and local grain raised locally," to improve the organization: A. The existing people's self-defense forces should include: (1) county standing self-defense companies; (2) township standing self-defense squads. Existing firearms and registered civilian firearms should be used as much as possible, and their salaries and expenses should be uniformly allocated and directed by the county magistrate. They should actively and mobilely search and suppress scattered bandits, and should be active frequently, not excessively regimented. B. The people's self-defense forces that do not separate from production should include: (1) Class A people's self-defense forces; (2) urban people's self-defense organizations organized according to the Class A self-defense force system. All able-bodied men in the county between the ages of eighteen and forty-five should be included in the organization according to regulations. In addition to using the firearms allocated to the standing squads, they should also use broadswords, spears, and hand grenades as supplements. Everyone must have a weapon in hand and be trained in its use, taking on tasks such as patrol, guard, rescue, and transportation. In the event of a bandit alarm, they should rise up together to fight the bandits with all their might. With the people's self-defense forces with firearms as the center, everyone should work hard to prevent the bandits from escaping.

The county magistrate must supervise the district, township, and baojia chiefs to conduct a household-by-household census in every village in the county, squeezing out the lurking Communist bandits. District, township, and baojia chiefs and villagers are responsible for reporting. Each case must be thoroughly investigated, and a small number of armed forces should be used to launch surprise searches to capture the lurking Communist elements. Not only must the Communist bandits' armed forces be eliminated, but the bandits' party and government organizations and special agents must also be captured.

From the county to the district, township, and baojia, there must be a strict intelligence network to constantly detect bandit activity and secretly report it to the county magistrate and nearby troops for immediate search and annihilation.

Our province is following the decision of the Six-Province Suppression Review Meeting, adopting a military system, and has declared Jiangnan a garrison area and Jiangbei a pacification area. All cases of banditry will be tried by military law. Furthermore, in order to quell the rebellion and in response to the emergency measures necessary for suppressing bandits, I, as commissioner and county magistrate, am responsible for dealing with important bandits captured. If emergency measures are necessary, the case should be investigated clearly and reported to the province, and submitted to the provincial government for review and approval before execution. Secondary important criminals should be given long-term imprisonment and re-education to prevent them from aiding the bandits and affecting public security. This measure has been reported to the central government and circulated for implementation. We must understand that the Communist bandits are social germs and arsonist thugs. If the bandits are allowed to run rampant, the majority of good people will be killed by the bandits. Lenience towards a few evil people is cruelty towards the majority of good people, so we must use strict laws to suppress banditry. In other words, it is precisely for the purpose of rectifying discipline and protecting the lives and property of all people that each county must maintain its determination to suppress bandits and eradicate the Communist germs. At the same time, in accordance with the central government's order, strictly enforce that no one may be released on bail in banditry cases before the trial is concluded.

The security forces, river police, and all county corps police, civil and military personnel stationed in various counties of our province should cooperate with the comprehensive suppression mission and work hard and diligently. In particular, the corps police are responsible for protecting the local area and must have the determination of "either bandits or me" and "either me or no bandits". They should actively and mobilely move out day and night to help the county government clear the population. They should also pay attention to discipline and avoid violating the people when stationed outside. It is only by rectifying discipline and integrating the armed forces with the people that they can become a truly civilian force and gain the assistance and support of the people.

County Public Opinion Organizations

And Local Leaders from All Walks of Life:

Everyone hates the brutality of the Communist bandits, and your strong will and correct understanding are admirable. During this period of comprehensive suppression, I hope that everyone will work together to assist governments at all levels, complete the mobilization and fulfill the national policy of suppressing the bandits, and awaken the people at all times and in all places to rise up and fight the bandits. Chairman Chiang said at the Six-Province Suppression Review Meeting that measures needed for bandit suppression must be implemented and there can be no obstacles. He also instructed the governors of each province to tell all public opinion organizations to work together to complete this great mission.

Various measures needed for bandit suppression, such as organizing the people's self-defense forces, providing salaries and clothing expenses for the corps police and public school employees, setting up telecommunications and transportation, managing the baojia household registration system, and constructing bunkers, are all very heavy and important tasks. Without a strong organization and effort, the Communist bandits cannot be thoroughly eliminated and social tranquility ensured. At present, local finances are tight, but bandit suppression measures are urgently needed. Our public opinion organizations and leaders from all walks of life have deeply understood this reality, and I hope that you will tell all the people to raise the awareness of the struggle for survival against bandits, displaying the spirit of the War of Resistance, contributing money if you have money, and contributing effort if you have effort. The strength of all the people is our copper wall and iron wall. A month ago, I flew to Xuzhou because of the tense military situation outside of Xuzhou and personally discussed plans to strengthen the city's fortifications with Commander Gu. I convened a meeting of local people and quickly raised a huge sum of 20 billion yuan for construction, which was jointly managed by the Army Headquarters and local communities. Most of the construction funds were paid by the industrial and financial sectors. Although Xuzhou has suffered from repeated wars and the economy has declined, it was still able to raise this huge sum, and the people's morale is firm and courageous, which is truly commendable. I especially hope that people in Jiangnan society will use this spirit to work together to establish public security in Jiangnan.

Field grains and taxes are legitimate public supplies. In particular, grain is needed to cooperate with the needs of the suppression of rebellion, so it is necessary to actively pay, speed up collection, as people of any country have the obligation to pay grain and taxes. The Communist bandits attempt to obstruct grain administration and undermine good landlord-tenant relations, conspiring to instigate resistance to grain and rent, intimidating landlords and wealthy households with confiscation of property in order to carry out their conspiracy to extort grain and labor. We must recognize the Communist bandits' tricks. The Communist bandits are jealous of the smooth progress of grain administration and labor administration, which is what we should strive to implement. The Communist bandits take landlords and wealthy households as targets of struggle, so large households should take the lead in paying grain in order to assist in the completion of the bandit suppression mission and ensure their own lives and property.

### Township and Village Chiefs and All Citizens

Township and village chiefs are the cornerstone of grassroots politics. They are responsible for household registration of residents under their jurisdiction, reporting suspected communist elements, and will be punished as harboring bandits if they fail to report or discover them in advance and allow them to hide.

If the people discover traces of bandits, they must immediately report them secretly to the township and village chiefs, who should immediately report them to the county government and quickly search and arrest them for legal action by the county. The people must be responsible for reporting traces of bandits in adjacent hidden areas. Failure to report bandits will be punished as harboring bandits according to the regulations of joint guarantee and shared responsibility.

Grassroots personnel at both ends of the spectrum, in the mountains and counties, will be investigated and rectified one by one, and those found to be bandits will be punished as such.

Township and village chiefs and the people must not cover up for bandits. If they allow the collection of grain, extort money, communicate with bandits, discuss with bandits, or harbor bandits, they will be punished as bandits once verified.

Chairman Chiang said, "Using soldiers is not as good as using the people." For their own safety and to avoid being killed by a small number of communist bandits, the people should all strive to survive, firmly resolve to suppress bandits, participate in self-defense work, and fight to the death, refusing to coexist with communist bandits. All government measures to suppress bandits are based on the needs of the majority of the people. We must complete the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and make concerted efforts. As far as Jiangsu is concerned, since the restoration, I have been encouraging the entire province to "restore order, stabilize people's livelihood," and have repeatedly told the local elders and compatriots to be brave in self-defense and to seek regeneration through self-reliance. If the 34 million people of Jiangsu can work together with one heart, not only can they quell the chaos in Jiangsu, but also easily suppress the banditry throughout the country!

### False Claim of Recruiting Workers, Defrauding Villagers of Property, Major Swindler Xue Fubao Arrested

[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 15th] In the area of Huazhuang Sihe Township in the southern countryside of this county, two people, a man and a woman, falsely claimed to be recruiting workers for a Shanghai factory and defrauded a large amount of money from the local villagers. More than 100 villagers were deceived one after another. The mastermind, Xue Fubao, from Yanqiao, 27 years old, used to work in a rubber overshoe factory in Shanghai. Because of his improper behavior, he was fired by the factory in April of this year. He returned to Wuxi and, after being idle for several months, Xue was extremely bored and came up with a whimsical idea to deceive the villagers in the countryside for a living. He happened to meet Zhou Panqi, a farmer from Xipengtou Village, Qianqiao, and they colluded with each other. Xue falsely claimed to be a foreman of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory in Shanghai and was ordered to come to Qianqiao to recruit 50 workers, with a monthly salary of 1.4 million yuan and free food and lodging. Zhou was moved by the news and fell into his trap. He immediately introduced Xue to others and volunteered to recruit dozens of people. He went to his home in Qianqiao and gathered 31 men and women from the same village that night, each paying 25,000 yuan as an introduction fee to Xue. The next day, Xue led them by car to Shanghai. Xue sent the villagers to a thatched shed near Xujiahui to stay temporarily, and then falsely claimed that he was going to the trade union to register. The crowd waited for a long time but he did not return. They went to the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory to inquire, and the factory replied that there was no such person. The crowd then realized that they had been deceived. However, they did not bring much money and wandered back to Wuxi, enduring great hardship. Recently, Xue and a woman deceived more than 80 men and women villagers in the southern countryside with the same trick, obtaining more than 8 million yuan. On the 14th of this month, a girl named Wang Gendi, who was one of the victims, happened to meet the major swindler on the road and dragged him to the criminal police team. On the 15th, he was transferred to the local prosecutor's office for legal action.

### Basketball League Opens; Dagong Defeats U.S. Military Police; All Three Division A Games Are One-Sided

[Our Newspaper Report] The third basketball league opened last night at the City Gymnasium. Dagong has considerable appeal, and there were many spectators despite the severe cold and rain. In the A1 group, the U.S. Military Police were technically immature and far from being Dagong's opponent. Amid laughter, Dagong won easily with a score of 65-25. The first half ended 32-13. In the other two A2 group games, Jiashen defeated Yizhong in a one-sided match, 55-24, with the first half ending 28-12.

### "The Therapeutic Effect of Nebulization Therapy for Asthma"

— Cheng Guoshu

Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital Provides Special Equipment for Patients' Use

In my previous article in this publication, "Phlegm-Fluid Asthma," I provided some instructions on the drug treatment of asthma. However, asthma is known to be stubborn and difficult to treat. In addition to drug therapy, it is also advisable to use nebulization therapy to assist it. This "nebulization therapy" is quite effective, so I am adding supplementary information to inform asthma sufferers.

The so-called "nebulization therapy" for asthma involves using one or several drugs in the form of water vapor spray, so that its effect directly reaches the patient's bronchial tubes and plays a functional role. The incessant work of asthma is actually caused by the bronchial tubes. This nebulization therapy is sufficient to relieve the tension of the bronchial tubes and reduce its attacks, and the symptoms are greatly reduced.

Patients with asthma should use nebulization therapy twice a day. During severe attacks, it is advisable to use it several times more, and its effect will be even more significant.

When administering nebulization therapy, aim the nebulizer at the patient's mouth and nose, and use a specially made mask to cover the head, so that the drug can directly reach the trachea. Regarding the drugs used during nebulization, they should be used according to the severity of the disease and the different causes of the disease, so that they can be effective. Care should be taken. If it is cardiac asthma (i.e., asthenic asthma), it is not advisable to use this nebulization therapy. Therefore, patients should first seek medical diagnosis before using it.

The equipment used for nebulization must be specially made, and most ordinary private clinics are not equipped with it. Because I feel that the procedure is troublesome, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital has specially prepared this equipment to meet the needs of patients at any time. I have used this to cure many cases of asthma, and there are experienced nurses to manage this matter, so it is more reliable.

### Women's "Typhoid Fever"

— Shen Zhongli

Women's typhoid fever is no different from men's, but it often occurs when menstruation is about to arrive, so there are many changes, and it is important to distinguish them. It is necessary to make a detailed diagnosis so as not to be mistaken. The name typhoid fever is a common term, not the proper name. It is called winter warmth when it is contracted in winter, which is also what Western medicine calls paratyphoid fever. The initial symptoms include fever, chills, headache and dizziness, weakness in the limbs, chest tightness and nausea, white and greasy tongue coating, and a soft and rapid pulse. If it coincides with the arrival of menstruation, the menstruation is light, the color is bright or dark, and there are blood clots, excessive vaginal discharge, and abdominal discomfort. In severe cases, the fever does not subside and there is stabbing pain in the chest and ribs. Medication should be given to quickly relieve wind-cold, promote sweating to reduce fever, and add blood-activating and Qi-regulating drugs, which should be effective. If the fever increases, then prevent the fever from entering the blood chamber, which can lead to mental confusion and delirium, and groping of clothes and bed. In this case, it is appropriate to add drugs to clear heat and promote blood circulation, and open the orifices to clear the mind, so that the fever will dissipate with the blood.

If a pregnant woman contracts winter warmth and has a high fever, and the pregnancy is six or seven months along, emergency measures should be taken to protect the fetus. The ancient method was to apply well-bottom mud to the abdomen, but now it can be changed to using water bags or cold water towels. Prescribe heat-clearing and pregnancy-stabilizing drugs, and urgently administer Coptis and Gypsum.

In postpartum fever, mild cases have fresh and purplish lochia, lower abdominal pain, chest tightness and headache. Severe cases have sudden cessation of lochia, mental confusion, and often exhibit air-grasping behavior, which is very frightening. At the onset, medication such as Angelica, Peach Kernel, Pangolin Scales, Raw Rehmannia, and Ligusticum wallichii should be used. In severe cases, administer Rhinoceros Horn, Moutan Bark, Honeysuckle, and Forsythia. There are also cases of rashes and eruptions, which are the most dangerous. Experienced physicians who are well-versed in the classics should administer medication according to the symptoms, which can lead to hope of escaping danger.

### General Discussion of Bone Diseases: Hunchback

— Tao Muzhang

Bone tuberculosis is more common in children. Why is this so? Because children's bones are soft and fragile, and if they are injured, although they cry and wail, parents think it is an accidental fall and do not pay attention. They do not know that the injured area cannot recover immediately, and over time, the periosteum is damaged, forming a pus-filled bulge. The skin appears without swelling or pain. Also, after this disease ulcerates, it spreads east and west, moving without a fixed location. Therefore, the treatment of bone tuberculosis is different from other departments. The method of blocking the root must be used to stop its spread.

Moreover, after this disease ulcerates, there are many changes. The pus is clear and thin, like soy milk, like rotten water. Over time, the body's essence leaks out through this, and the complexion becomes pale, the appearance becomes withered, and there is afternoon fever, creating a dangerous situation.

Our bones are like the steel structure of a house, and are extremely important and should not be tilted. The spine is like the main beam of a house, and is even more important. Hunchback, known in Western medicine as vertebral inflammation, is characterized by a slightly protruding back or a heavy back. This disease is caused by deficiency and exhaustion, and is called tuberculous spondylitis. In strong people, food enters the stomach and is transported to all parts of the body. The limbs and bones are strong and powerful. Once the disease occurs, all the abundant fluids and good nutrition are eroded by tuberculosis bacteria. The spinal cord cannot be generated. Moreover, these bacteria lie dormant deep within the affected area, initially eroding the bone spaces. By the time the periosteum is eroded, the trend has become the original cause. Therefore, the onset of this disease requires the most attention and should not be ignored. If you feel a slight heaviness in the waist, you should immediately consult a good orthopedist for surgery, and at the same time prescribe appropriate medication to strengthen the patient's resistance. Most importantly, protect the good bones around the decayed bone to prevent it from spreading, because treating disease is like fighting a fire. If the fire spreads, it will be impossible to save. Good firefighters often push down walls to suppress the fire, and the principle is the same. For other syphilitic and traumatic spondylitis, appropriate treatments should be applied, which will not be repeated here.

### Velvet Antler: A Potent Winter Tonic

— Hu Guangxuan

Velvet antler is a well-known tonic in traditional Chinese medicine, and has been used for a long time. Winter is the most suitable time to take this tonic. According to research, it contains valuable velvet antler essence, which is actually an endocrine gland.

Velvet antler is the nascent antler of a deer, containing blood and not yet ossified, like a tender bud of grass, soft like an eggplant. The most famous ones come from Guandong. Generally speaking, if it is picked too young, the blood and qi will not be complete, and the actual strength will be small. If it is too old, the blood will be dry and the strength will be weak. It should be about four or five inches long, shaped like a forked saddle, and the end should be like agate red jade. The one that is purely blood is called a blood slice, and it has the best effect. The next best is the one that looks like a honeycomb, called a sand slice. The one that is connected to the bone and resembles a horn has the weakest effect.

Velvet antler is a potent tonic and strengthening medicine. It nourishes essence and blood, and strengthens muscles and bones. It is most suitable for people with a yang deficiency constitution. If it is taken improperly, taking a large amount all at once, or if the constitution is yin deficient, it often causes nosebleeds, vomiting blood, red eyes, dizziness, and other problems. It is advisable for a doctor to examine the suitability of the constitution, and then determine the amount to be taken. It is best to take a small amount at a time, and take it for several days.

### Shi Quan Da Bu Gao (Ten-Ingredient Tonic Paste)

— Chen Zhihui

The efficacy of Chinese medicine is actually better than Western medicine, because it is suitable for the constitution of Chinese people. This is also true for tonics. This winter season is a good time for tonics. Those who are economically well-off should seek medical attention and prescribe a paste tonic, which is best suited to their constitution. The next best option is to buy and take Shi Quan Da Bu Gao, which is also quite suitable. In general, Shi Quan Da Bu Gao contains qi-tonifying and blood-tonifying herbs, such as ginseng, poria, atractylodes, licorice, angelica, rehmannia, white peony, ligusticum, astragalus, and cinnamon. When a person's qi and blood are sufficient, the body is strong. If there is fatigue or excessive thinking, the person will be thin, tired, and have tinnitus and dizziness. This paste greatly replenishes qi and blood, and has great effect.

### Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy

— Cai Bochun

After a woman becomes pregnant for more than a month, she often experiences mild nausea and vomiting. This is called morning sickness, and it is a physiological change. Mild cases do not require medical treatment. To reduce its occurrence, simply pay attention to regulating the diet, eating foods that are easy to digest and nutritious, and avoiding irritating foods. Especially avoid foods that are usually disliked, otherwise they will easily cause vomiting. At leisure, engage in various pastimes and conversations to forget about it.

However, in severe cases of morning sickness, the nausea and vomiting gradually become severe, and even vomit with every drink and every meal. Even when the stomach is empty and there is nothing to vomit, the vomiting of yellow fluid does not stop. The mouth is dry, the lips are cracked, there are headaches and insomnia, there is no appetite, there is a lack of nutrition, and it can develop into a serious illness, which can cause miscarriage. Treatment should be given.

### Recent News from Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital Accepting Medical Advisory Roles at Various Factories

Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital, located at 594 Beijing West Road, has been established for five years. Under the leadership of President Cheng, it has made remarkable progress. Recently, it has added several more wards to meet the needs of patients. Industrial and commercial entities are vying to engage them as medical advisors, such as Wing On Textile Factory, Postal Workers Union, International Radio Station Employee Welfare Committee, Yi Tai Xing Coal Ball Factory, and Hui Ming Flashlight Factory. The hospital also has medical advisory registration rules. If you need a special appointment, you can contact the hospital in person.

### Authorities Prepare to Sell Large Quantities of Food; Rice Market Inflation Expected to Be Curtailed; Social Affairs Bureau Investigates Inventory and Sales Volume of Rice Shops; Failure to Report Will Result in License Revocation

[Our Newspaper Report] Due to the continuous rainy weather, the amount of rice arriving at the market yesterday was relatively scarce, totaling 7,576.5 shi. The price of white japonica rice once soared to a new high of 980,000, but ended at 920,000, still 5,000 yuan lower than the previous day. According to Gu Mingqi, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, the market may continue to decline slightly today. The authorities have prepared a large quantity of rice of various kinds, which can be sold to the market when necessary. Once the weather clears up and the supply increases, the price of rice will fall.

In order to prevent merchants from hoarding grain and to understand the city's accurate needs so that the government can supply it, the Social Affairs Bureau has previously ordered all rice shops in the city to submit monthly reports on their incoming, outgoing, and inventory quantities. A total of 1,600 members of the Rice Shop Guild are registered in the city. Approximately one report was submitted in October and November. The Social Affairs Bureau initially plans to issue warnings to those who fail to comply with the order. If they continue to disobey, their licenses will be revoked.

### Sluggish Sales of Coarse Grains

Yesterday, more than 7,500 shi of rice and other grains arrived in the north and south markets. Shopkeepers found it difficult to sell at the high prices, and their appetite waned. The market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. In the end, japonica rice softened after a brief increase, while medium-grain rice saw its gains offset, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Glutinous rice also remained stable. Flour sales remained strong, and prices continued to rise. Wheat bran rose by 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales weakened, and prices plummeted near the close, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Yellow soybean sales were sluggish, and local merchants were not interested, as oil factories remained inactive, causing prices to fall by 10,000 yuan, or even 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Cowpeas remained stagnant, falling by 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum sales were the most sluggish, with few buyers. Corn also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw weaker sales, and local merchants were bearish, with prices falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Tianjin has stopped exporting sesame seeds, and oil factories are not active, causing prices to fall by another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Black sesame seed sales were slow.

### Oil Market Declines Across the Board

Soybean oil factory supplies were normal, and prices fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil both fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Clear oil also weakened, falling by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Although the supply of raw oil from Longhai has resumed, the supply from northern Jiangsu is not weak. There are also arrivals from Qingdao and central Shandong. Arrivals from the Yangtze River have increased slightly, resulting in supply exceeding demand, market sentiment softening, and prices plunging by more than 100,000 yuan.

### Active Sales of Sugar

Yesterday's sugar market saw tighter gains due to active sales. White sugar rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, reaching as high as 70,000 yuan. Brown and red sugar rose by varying amounts of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. The guild's posted prices were: 24 coarse white sugar spot cargo (large bags) at 1.33 million yuan, 20 Taichung granulated white sugar at 1.3 million yuan, Taichung red sugar at similar prices, No. 98 million yuan for Hainan Red sugar, and 1.3 million yuan for bag-packed high-quality Xinghua white sugar, 1.24 million yuan for basket-packed, Xinghua red sugar at 1.155 million yuan, and 940,000 yuan for Diao Qing. Later, another Star opened at 960,000 yuan, with a total of 1,500 pieces traded. It was heard that in the afternoon's unofficial trading, the price of white sugar eased slightly.

### Tight Credit and Sluggish Sales; Yarn and Cloth Prices Both Fall; Raw Cotton Prices Remain Firm Due to Strong Demand from Factories

Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened with a slight decline and then rebounded slightly. Subsequently, due to sluggish demand from both local and external buyers and increasingly tight credit conditions, many merchants, burdened by cash flow problems, sold off their holdings, causing the market to decline. Towards the close, fabric manufacturers made some purchases at lower prices, causing the market to recover slightly. However, the closing price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was still 600,000 yuan lower than the previous day, at 48.4 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also fell by small amounts ranging from 100,000 to 1 million yuan.

Cotton Cloth Market Declines

The cotton cloth market opened calmly, but subsequently, due to increasingly tight credit conditions, those burdened by cash flow problems frequently sold off their holdings, especially Shanxi merchants. There were few buyers in the market, resulting in supply exceeding demand and prices plummeting. Near the close, individual customers made scattered purchases, and retail investors bought at lower prices, stabilizing the market. In the end, the prices of 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths all fell by 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 yuan. Twill, straight tribute cloth, and bleached cloth prices also fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. However, the prices of colored cloth and serge cloth remained firm. In addition, demand from gray cloth umbrella factories was strong, and prices rose by about 10,000 yuan.

Raw Cotton Prices Remain Firm

Yesterday's raw cotton prices remained firm. In recent days, due to tight credit conditions, transactions were limited, and the market fluctuated. However, due to limited supply and continued sales, yarn factory demand was strong. Therefore, despite the tight credit conditions, cotton yarn was used to exchange for raw cotton to facilitate transactions. Prices initially remained stable and then rose, but ultimately lacked momentum due to the softening of cotton yarn prices. A total of 700 bales, or 1,540 dan, were traded. The price for delivery to factories was 5.291 million yuan for Luoyang and 5.125 million yuan for Dazhongji. In addition, 540 dan of 20-count yarn were used to exchange for raw cotton on the yarn market, and 100 pieces of yarn were traded. 1,100 dan of Dazhongji were exchanged for raw cotton, and 200 pieces of yarn were traded. A total of 200 bales, or 1,540 dan, were traded at the port delivery price of 4.547 million yuan for yarn and 4.96 million yuan for Lingbao. Cottonseeds were priced at 940,000 yuan.

China Textile Construction Company Sells Cloth

[Our Newspaper Report] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 10,200 bolts. There were a total of 256 purchase orders, including 10 from manufacturers, purchasing 400 bolts, and 246 from cloth merchants, purchasing 9,800 bolts.

### The Consistent Decline of Silk Prices

Yesterday's rayon market continued its ten-thousand-yuan decline, due to the payment for allocated goods being due on Thursday. Silk merchants had no interest in acquiring these goods, leading to weakened confidence. In the morning, the "旭" (Xu) brand, number 120, series 1A glossy rayon, opened at seven million yuan, but attracted no interest, closing at six million yuan in the afternoon. In the afternoon, due to extremely tight credit conditions, sellers were even more eager to sell, and prices fell steadily. The final offer was two million yuan, six million yuan lower than the previous day. Futures sales were around eighty million yuan.

Factory Conditions

Market conditions were weakening, and yesterday's prices saw another decline. Due to the allocation of goods to smaller factories, transactions were infrequent. In the morning, a few "另担" (ling dan) were sold at a price of ninety million yuan, with four or five futures contracts. In the afternoon, prices declined further, with offers at eighty-nine million yuan, but no transactions. CD grade rayon was offered at around ninety-one to ninety-two million yuan, two million yuan lower than the previous day. "千经" (Qian Jing) also trended downward, with ordinary "另担" at around sixty-eight million yuan.

Silk Goods

Yesterday's market saw mixed ups and downs. "眞丝" (Zhen Si) silk quilt covers from 华强 (Hua Qiang) opened at five million seven hundred thousand yuan with some transactions, but due to an imbalance in supply and demand, prices gradually declined, falling to a minimum of five million yuan. Some took advantage of the low prices to buy, leading to a rebound, with the closing price for immediate delivery at five million four hundred thousand yuan. "大诚" (Da Cheng) goods were at fifty-five million yuan, and "美亚" (Mei Ya) goods were at seventy million yuan. Rayon goods saw erratic prices due to falling raw material prices and extremely tight credit conditions. Ordinary 华锦 (Hua Jin) crepe was around seventy thousand yuan.

### Further Exchange of Opinions Between the Textile Adjustment Committee and Private Yarn Mills

[Our Dispatch] The Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, 表良 (Biao Liang), invited four heads of private yarn mills, 王啓字 (Wang Qizi), 唐星海 (Tang Xinghai), 荣尔仁 (Rong Erren), and 刘靖基 (Liu Jingji), for discussions around 4 PM yesterday. They engaged in further exchanges of views on the implementation plan for the management of cotton yarn and cloth. Mr. 袁 (Yuan) also instructed Mr. 王 (Wang) and others to inform member yarn mills belonging to the Six District Associations to promptly submit statistical data on each factory's cotton inventory, cotton requirements, yarn inventory, and cotton yarn production and sales, for record and verification purposes.

### Hope for Effective Crackdown on Adulteration of Cotton

[Our Dispatch] The cotton inspection bureaus in various provinces, originally established in our country, have been abolished due to the impact of years of war. As a result, the bad practice of adulterating cotton with water has become prevalent in various cotton-producing areas in recent years. The excellent cotton production is being wasted by human actions, leading to a decline in quality, which is regrettable. Various stakeholders in the cotton yarn industry hope that the responsible authorities will promptly restore the revenue collection offices in various cotton-producing areas and are actively working with the construction departments of various provinces to prepare for the restoration of inspection agencies. So far, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces have established cotton inspection institutes. The Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Inspection Institute has three inspection districts in Jiading, Pudong, and Tonghai, and has set up inspection stations in Taicang, Baoshan, Changshu, Zhoupu, and Haimen. The Zhejiang Provincial Inspection Institute is divided into two inspection districts in Ningbo and Xiaoshan, and has an inspection station in Yuyao. The Hubei Provincial Inspection Institute is divided into five inspection districts in Xiangfan, Suizao, Jingsha, Tianmen, and Eastern Hubei, and has set up inspection stations in Laohekou, Suixian, Jianli, and Xiantao. The Shaanxi Provincial Inspection Institute is divided into four inspection districts in Weinan, Jingyang, Chaoyi, and Xianyang, and has set up inspection stations in Huaxian, Sanyuan, Yongle, and Gaoling. The Henan Provincial Inspection Institute has set up the Zhengzhou Inspection District and has set up inspection stations in Kaifeng, Shangqiu, and Xinxiang. It is expected that after the active launch of inspection work, the quality of cotton production in various provinces will improve day by day.

In addition, the Cotton Production Revenue Collection Office promoted American cotton varieties in various provinces throughout the country this year, totaling 73,015 market dan. In the provinces of the Yellow River basin, varieties starting with "斯" (Si) are the most common. In the provinces of the Yangtze River basin, varieties starting with "德" (De) and "珂" (Ke) are the most common. Among the provinces promoting improved varieties, Jiangsu ranks first, with a total of 19,511 dan. Henan ranks second with 17,866 dan, and Hubei ranks third with 14,613 dan. The rest are all below 6,000 dan, with Jiangxi having the least at only 168 dan.

### Unprecedentedly Tight Credit Conditions

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, credit conditions were unprecedentedly tight, with black market interest rates as high as two jiao and seven fen or more. Some commercial firms and manufacturers felt it difficult to manage their cash flow. Yesterday, the Four Banks and Two Bureaus had a net inflow of 222.6 billion, with the Central Bank receiving 49.6 billion. Large-scale exchanges resulted in an outflow of 7.3 billion, and foreign banks had an inflow of 41.5 billion. Small-scale exchanges resulted in an outflow of 256.7 billion, with Chinese banks receiving 126.5 billion. Other banks and bureaus all had net inflows.

### Strict Investigation of Returned Checks by the Financial Management Bureau

[Our Dispatch] Since its establishment last week, the Municipal Gold Exchange Management Bureau has been actively launching its work. It is paying particular attention to cracking down on returned checks from firms and the use of checks for same-day transactions. It is reported that the situation with returned checks did not clear until around 10 PM. This caused the positions of various firms at the exchange to be settled as late as 3 AM the next morning.

### Short-Lived Positive Momentum; Hua Shares Turn Weak in the Aftermarket

The situation for Hua shares yesterday was volatile. The threat of tight credit conditions increased, and the investigation of accounts outside the market intensified. Although there was a temporary rebound due to the stimulus of small-cap stocks, 永纱 (Yong Sha) failed to surpass its previous high, and small-cap stocks also showed signs of exhaustion, so the positive momentum was not sustainable.

Early in the morning, due to extremely tight credit conditions, confidence was difficult to boost, and the market opened lower. 永舷梯 (Yong Xuan Ti) opened at 461 yuan and 470 yuan, and then fell further to 459 yuan and 464 yuan. 华丰 (Hua Feng) and 内衣 (Nei Yi) rose to the limit, and small-cap stocks were surprisingly popular, boosting confidence. Prices gradually rose to a high of 473 yuan for immediate delivery and 486 yuan for deferred delivery. Some took profits at the high prices, and the interest rate outside the market opened as high as three jiao and three jiao four fen, but there were still no buyers. 永纱 (Yong Sha) ultimately failed to maintain a stable upward trend for long and fell back to 451 yuan and 457 yuan. At this time, small-cap stocks still showed some positive performance, moving cautiously and steadily. Near noon, prices were forced down to a low of 448 yuan and 456 yuan, and then closed at 450 yuan and 457 yuan. 永业 (Yong Ye) suddenly rose to the limit. As a result, 华丰 (Hua Feng), the immediate delivery share compared to the previous close, rose to the limit and then rebounded slightly, up another 10%. 闸北内衣 (Zhabei Nei Yi) rose to the limit and then rebounded, rising slightly. 永业 (Yong Ye) rose to the limit, while 新华 (Xin Hua), 五和 (Wu He), and 中兴 (Zhong Xing) also rose by slightly less than 10%. 火柴 (Huochai) fell by half a percentage point, 中纺 (Zhong Fang) rose by half a percentage point, and 永纱 (Yong Sha), 中法 (Zhong Fa), 永公 (Yong Gong), 景纶 (Jing Lun), 商務 (Shang Wu), and 荣丰 (Rong Feng) fell slightly. 大通 (Da Tong) was flat, and the rest rose slightly. For deferred delivery shares, 华丰 (Hua Feng) and 景福 (Jing Fu) were still flat, 永纱 (Yong Sha) and 美亚 (Mei Ya) fell slightly, and 新光 (Xin Guang) and 信和 (Xin He) rose slightly.

In the aftermarket, numbers 112, 219, 160, 36, 65, 197, 8, and 83 were dumped, and rumors of a US$60 million loan resurfaced. The national banks had a significant net inflow in the exchange, and prices gradually fell to 447 yuan for immediate delivery and 448 yuan for deferred delivery. The number of buyers gradually increased, and the off-market price was again higher than the on-market deferred delivery price. Number 36 covered its short position, rising back to around 455 yuan and 465 yuan. Before the close, prices weakened again, closing at 454 yuan and 457 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, 中纺 (Zhong Fang) fell by 10%, 勤兴 (Qin Xing) and 景纶 (Jing Lun) fell by less than half a percentage point, 中法 (Zhong Fa) and 永公 (Yong Gong) were flat, and the rise and fall of the remaining shares were slight. 华丰 (Hua Feng) fell by half a percentage point for tear delivery shares, 永纱 (Yong Sha) was flat, and the rest fell slightly. Off-market, old shares like 大生 (Da Sheng) rebounded by half a percentage point, and the rest were stable.

### Continued Rise in Unified Bonds; Foreign Shares Uneventful

Government bonds continued to trend upward yesterday, with approximately seven million yuan traded. Numbers 555 and 552 rose, while numbers 500 and 360 declined. Unified Class C opened at 33,500 yuan, peaked at 34,500 yuan, and bottomed at 32,700 yuan, and then formed a consolidation pattern. Compared to the previous close, Class A and B rose by 2,100, Class C rose by 2,400, Class D rose by 1,800, and Class E rose by 1,200.

Yesterday, foreign shares weakened due to non-business-related stimuli, and buyers were cautious and defeated. However, the trading volume was not large, and the process was uneventful. 怡纱 (Yi Sha) started at 425,000 yuan and fell slightly to around 410,000 yuan at the close. Compared to the previous close, 怡纱 (Yi Sha), 英联会 (Ying Lian Hui), 德丰 (De Feng), paper, steel, and telephone shares each fell by half a percentage point. 怡啤 (Yi Pi), shipping, tram, 祥泰 (Xiang Tai), 自来火 (Zi Lai Huo), and rubber shares each fell by 10%, and the advertising industry fell slightly.

### Rumors of Increased Factory Prices; Soap Prices Soar

Yesterday, in the market for daily-use soaps, due to rumors that the Huang Xiangmao factory would increase its prices to 820,000 yuan for allocation, traders in the market were active, and demand from all parties was surprisingly strong, leading to soaring prices. As a result, 固本 (Gu Ben) soap surged by 130,000 yuan to 1,110,000 yuan. 箭刀 (Jian Dao) soap rose by 120,000 yuan to 1,080,000 yuan. Huang Xiangmao soap rose by 100,000 yuan, and other soaps were also firm.

### Agreed on Markup for More Than Twenty Kinds of Steel

[Our Dispatch] The meeting of the Review Committee on Goods Imported by the China Trust Bureau Using Self-Provided Foreign Exchange was held for the eighth time yesterday. In addition to the purchase price of paper, which has been decided to be 55% above the landed price, the markup issues for more than 20 kinds of steel have been separately agreed upon. After reaching an agreement with various importers tomorrow, it will be announced. The allocation contract format has also been drafted. It is reported that the next review meeting will discuss the markup issues for forest materials and hardware.

### Fragmented Woolen Fabric Transactions; Only Paris Fabric Had Transactions

The prices for woolen fabrics mostly remained the same yesterday, and transactions were mostly fragmented. Those with tight positions rushed to sell due to the approaching New Year. Conversely, those with ample cash were looking to buy on the dips, but mostly limited to Paris, Van Lideing, and Chunhua fabrics. Recently, the transaction price for top-grade Paris fabric was 750,000 yuan per yard, and second-grade was 700,000 yuan.

Tea Market Trends Upward

Yesterday's tea market: Transactions remained lacking in actual volume, due to the continued impact of cloudy and rainy weather. Buyers continued to remain on the sidelines, while sellers' sentiments were firmer than the previous day. Furthermore, asking prices gradually increased, so the market sentiment was more bullish.

### A Little Knowledge of Storytelling

— Dai Bufan

Lu Xun's "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction," page 231 (Beixin Fifth Edition): "Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern Times" in twenty-two volumes, titled "Edited by the Master of the East Wall Mountain Studio," contains Po Lingwei's work, including four articles from "Stories to Awaken the World" (Fifteen Strings of Cash: A Joke Turns into a Major Disaster; Chen Duo's Life and Death Marriage; Zhang Shu'er's Ingenious Escape from Yang Sheng; Liu Xiaoguan, Brothers and Sisters in Drag), another article is "The Mei Islet Regret" from "Tales of West Lake," the origins of the rest are not detailed. There are two points in this section that seem to require supplementation:

1. Volume 17 of "Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern Times," "Wu Baoan Repays His Benefactor by Forgetting His Family," is divided into two parts. The first part tells the story of Wu Bao, and the second part narrates the story of Liu Sheng. "Wu Baoan Abandons His Family to Redeem His Friend" originally comes from "Ancient and Modern Novels" and was also included in "Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern Times," but after being changed to "Repays His Benefactor by Forgetting His Family" by the "Master of the East Wall Mountain Studio," many parts were deleted and altered. This point may have been an oversight by Lu Xun when writing the book?

2. Volume 15 of "Strange Tales," "Scholars Without Integrity and Wealth Living Lowly," is an abridged adaptation of Volume 8 of "Stone Nodding," "A Greedy Man Sells Romance in Six Courtyards." In "Stone Nodding," the greedy official is named Wu Shoutao, meaning to become Tao Zhugong; in "Strange Tales," he is named He Youzhi, which also has a hidden meaning. I have read both texts and found that many sentences are the same (the text is long, not recorded). The plots are also roughly the same. The biggest difference is that after Wu Shoutao opened a brothel, a Wang merchant came to prostitute in the six courtyards and wrote a poem in each courtyard ridiculing and retaliating, while "Strange Tales" omits this; Wu Shoutao's death was due to a sudden fainting and possession by a vengeful spirit; Gai Youzhi's death was due to implication in a theft case, being beaten, and the unfilial behavior of his children, which made him faint and see ghosts.

In addition to the five articles pointed out by Lu Xun, we can now clearly identify the source of one more and "half" of the twenty-two volumes of "Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern Times." If we continue to search, perhaps we can find more?

### The Feeling of Ci Poetry

— Wang Mengou

Some literary works seem to require the embodiment of language, often gathering a large number of nouns in the organization of the text, with many places like listing a grocery store's inventory, or like a furniture catalog. The author uses these embodied object names to simplify the process of the reader accepting the author's emotions expressed in the sentences. Furthermore, the appropriate coordination of nouns representing different objects will sometimes mutually reflect another associative image and feeling.

In fact, this effect was used earlier in poetry. The author uses the sublimation of feeling to transfer emotions to the realm of poetry. No matter how sublime the expected poetic realm is, its foundation cannot escape the experience of general senses. In other words, the author wants to use poetry to guide people into the realm of super-experience, and sometimes uses that general experience as a bridge. For example, "red rain" is beyond our experience, but Li He has: "Peach blossoms fall in disorder like red rain." Here, the general experience of peach blossoms falling in disorder is used to create a new image, and this new image and general experience mutually reflect the poetic realm expected by the author.

In the problem of "fu bi xing" (direct presentation, analogy, and allegory) discussed in Chinese poetics, any sentence that uses words such as "ru" (like), "si" (similar), "ruo" (as if), etc., roughly falls within the scope of "bi" (analogy). For example, Su Shi's "Old friends are each in a corner of the sky, looking at each other sparsely like morning stars." The sparse situation cannot be explained, so the general experience of the steadfastness of morning stars is used to reflect the realm of poetry and save countless unnecessary and non-specific descriptions. However, since this borrows embodied nouns to carry out the poetry of expressing emotions, many of the words such as "ru," "si," and "ruo" can be omitted. For example, Bai Juyi's "Song of Painting Bamboo": "The seven stalks on the west are strong and healthy, I remember seeing them on the rocks in front of the Tianzhu Temple; the eight stalks on the east are sparse and cold, I remember seeing them in the rain in the Xiangfei Temple." Here, the author's feelings of strength and health, and sparseness and coldness, two different states of bamboo, are to be expressed through general experience. Thus, there are concrete analogies of bamboo in front of the Tianzhu Temple on rocks and bamboo in the rain in the Xiangfei Temple. Even though we have no impression of the Tianzhu Temple and the Xiangfei Temple, temples and bamboo on rocks, and bamboo in the rain are always generally experienced. With this foundational experience, we can reflect the emotions of strength and health, and sparseness and coldness intended by the author.

However, this still uses embodied nouns to achieve the embodiment of abstract ideas. In addition, some things are originally embodied and are expressed with embodied nouns, such as Chuan Xuan's "The beauty is so beautiful, her face is like a lotus flower." This uses the lotus flower from general experience to make the beauty even more embodied. Also, such as Yue Jianwen's "Fifteen is somewhat more, the sun shines on the apricot beam for the first time," and Du Mu's "Graceful and slender, a little over thirteen, like a budding cardamom in the second month." Here, although we have no impression of the apricot beam and cardamom, the first sun on the apricot beam and the flower tips in the second month, the feelings contained in this kind of experience must be general. Therefore, we can be guided from embodied nouns into the author's intention and feeling. The same applies to using animal nouns as using plant nouns. Wang Anshi's "Clumsy horses, satisfied, vie for the road; overturned carts and hungry horses are not idle," and "Weak roots on the main road know it is difficult to plant, tired wings for many years want to fly away." Here, what people experience are animals or plants, but what they feel are people. There is also the opposite of this, such as Chen Qufei's "Camellia Flower Poem": "Green skirt and white face, first acquaintance, in the tenth month the camellia flower road opens." This uses our experience of women with simple and elegant green skirts and white faces to guide the author's emotions towards the camellia flower in the tenth month. Although this has the same effect as comparing people to flowers and comparing flowers to people, the nouns joined by "white face" and "green skirt" are still not concrete enough. Such as Bai Juyi's "Pear Blossom Poem": "Most told is a young widow in her boudoir, in white makeup, plain face, and green gauze skirt." This uses the coordination of embodied nouns such as white makeup, plain face, and green gauze skirt to save the embodiment of the widow, and then uses this very embodied feeling of a widow to guide us into the author's emotion towards the pear blossom. In this case, the lines about camellia flowers may be derived from the lines about pear blossoms. But in any case, the lines about pear blossoms are always more approachable because their creation is based on more general experience.

Our imagination is often limited to the scope of experience. Without experience, it is difficult to imagine. It is only a complex of experiences with different individuals. Literary works use the coordination of embodied nouns to achieve a so-called super-experience of poetic realm, or follow this reason. However, the nouns of objects often differ with time and space, and this space-time difference will become the sediment of experience, sometimes making experience lose its effect. Such as Li Shangyin's "Golden cicada lock burns incense to enter, jade tiger pulls silk to draw well water." What are golden cicada and jade tiger? We must wait for annotations and wait to sweep away the sediment of experience before we can imagine. But, such as Wen Tingyun's "Rough waves float on jasper steps, sunny sun shines on colorful flags," what are rough waves? If we have no experience of it, then it is just a dead cell in the poem.

However, the above examples are to use embodied description to emphasize feeling. A further step than this is to purely use the piling up of nouns to complete the sensory lines, such as Li Shangyin's "Sui Palace Poem": "Now the rotten grass has no fireflies, forever the deserted willows have evening crows," using rotten grass, fireflies, deserted willows, and evening crows to brew a feeling of ruins in order to convey the lament that human affairs are most impermanent. But these nouns are still not independent enough to be used. A further step than this is such as: "Lone sound, thatched cottage, moon; human tracks, frozen plank bridge, frost." Or "Two lines of tears under the lamp, a piece of Lingnan letter," or "Pear blossom courtyard, dissolving moon; willow pond, faint wind"; lines of this kind are purely a concrete arrangement of nouns, and each sentence can independently produce a complex feeling.

Sunshine and Xie Zi

A child fell ill, and was drowsy and spitting constantly. Except for the time to take medicine, he was almost always drowsy and unconscious. After several days of this, in his mother's anxiety and his own drowsiness, his fever finally subsided, and he felt awake. Casting aside a string of disordered dreams, perhaps also carrying some lingering traces of dreams, he opened his eyes and found, or rather, remembered that it was a spring morning. The sun, carrying a warm aura, shone in through the window. This radiance was reflected by the low-hanging curtains into blue shadows; was cast into gold by the small copper rods; was melted into white snow by the handkerchief his mother wore on her lapel. In these three colors, he began to pay attention to his mother's face--after several days of staying up all night, his mother was somewhat haggard, but this haggard could not hide her youth, even more so could it not hide the radiance of a mother's love. She seemed to be thinking, thinking about her child, why he was always drowsy, why he wouldn't wake up sooner... But suddenly turning her head, she found that her child was already awake, and so a hint of joyful smile covered her face. She leaned down, stroked his forehead with her hand, and asked him questions, but the child didn't say a word, somewhat blankly, because at this time, in his heart, in his eyes, there was only a patch of happy sunshine!

### Woodcuts of the Ming Dynasty

— Jin Dong

The picture on the right is one of the "Water Margin Leaves," painted by Chen Hongshou (Laolian) of Zhuji, Ming Dynasty, and engraved by Huang Zili of Xin'an. This type of print was probably popular in the Ming Dynasty as illustrations for short plays, and the images attached to works such as the Water Margin and the Romance of the West Chamber are particularly excellent, not only accurate and vivid in composition, but also extremely exquisite and powerful in engraving technique. They are indeed an important period in the history of Chinese woodcut art. "Leaves" were tools for gambling since the Tang and Song Dynasties, and became "Ma Diao" after the Tianqi period of the Ming Dynasty. The upper end of the northern "leaves" still has the words "two hundred thousand guan," which is probably still the form of paper money.

### Describing Characters

— Dongfang Mengwu

In describing characters, for me, the most important thing is to grasp the most characteristic subtle points, which can immediately make the character come alive. Long dialogues are unnecessary--three or two sentences of personalized words, a few typical words that fit the character and have muscle, are enough to succinctly bring out the character.--(Gladkov)

### Recent World Literature

Twenty-Fifth Death Anniversary of Korolenko

Recently, a photo of Vladimir Korolenko suddenly appeared in Soviet newspapers, with a gray beard, a high forehead, thick hair combed back, and kind eyes that penetrated people's hearts. This photo commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of Korolenko's death.

Moscow held a solemn memorial meeting for Korolenko. The audience included workers, students, writers, artists, and scientists. The meeting began with a speech by the writer Gorbachev. Then Professor Belchikov spoke about Korolenko's life and works. The actor Vsevolod Aksenov recited excerpts from Korolenko's diary.

Korolenko's literary heritage is preserved in the Lenin State Library in Moscow. In 1938, the author's daughter donated the author's manuscripts to the library for preservation. A total of sixty-eight volumes were collected, including Korolenko's autograph signatures, original manuscripts, proofs, and several corrected copies of "The Story of My Contemporary." He began writing this manuscript in 1906 and continued until his death. There is also a manuscript of his famous novel, "The Blind Musician." This book also has two Chinese translations by Zhang Yaquan and Zhang Wentian. Even after the publication of this book, Korolenko continued to revise it, adding new sections and various corrections.

Among the collected manuscripts, there is also an unprinted "Queer Girl," which is about strong and fearless revolutionary women. He wrote it in prison in 1880 and it was banned by the Tsar's men. It was not published for the first time until after 1905.

Due to this novelist's death, he was unable to complete his book about Emelyan Pugahev. The book is titled "Insurgent Tsar." The manuscript is also housed in the Lenin Library. The author's notes from 1879 to 1900 are also housed in this library.

Coincidentally, Ibram Deman's "Biography of Korolenko" has also been published by the Moscow Children's Literature Publishing House. Korolenko was the last of the famous pre-revolutionary Russian writers and a leader of the democratic movement in the 1870s. Gao Zangji called this elder brother someone who walked "a heroic and difficult road." He was imprisoned in the Vyshnevolotsk political prisoner jail and the Tobolsk artillery tower. He was also often exiled to remote places. Even before he became famous, he was often followed by secret agents and often interrogated. Although he was a kind and sensitive person and family man, he was often an enemy of the Tsar.

Derman had visited Korolenko many times and knew him very well. He was the first to write such a complete and popular biography. This book reveals his knowledge of Korolenko's childhood and student days.

Before he was 25 years old, Korolenko and other students protested against the school authorities for assisting the military police in searching for "politically untrustworthy" students, and was therefore exiled for the first time in 1876. His farthest exile was to Sloboda Amgu in 1881, because he refused to drink a toast to Tsar Alexander III.

Dahlman details Korolenko's life in Siberia, saying that he worked as a farmer and shoemaker, while using the keen eyes of an artist to study the life of the local people.

The publication of a collection of short stories about life in Siberia ("Makar's Dream" and others) and "The Blind Musician" were major events in Korolenko's life. Korolenko's works often speak of his hatred for the Tsar, and in court he defended the peasants.

Dahlman writes in detail about Korolenko's friendship with Chekhov, Gorky, and others. The book includes several letters from Gorky to Korolenko, which show his respect for this elder brother.

### Continued Notes and Interpretations from Zhang Chao's "You Meng Ying"

— Lü Lianggeng

Writing couplets together, discussing essays intimately, composing poems for the imperial court, and serving as envoys to tributary states are all the ultimate joys of life.

One more thing should especially be added: "Extensively viewing famous flowers."

For a military man not to engage in reckless battles is to possess the literary quality within military pursuits. For a scholar not to be pedantic is to possess the martial spirit within literary endeavors.

A soldier dying in battle, a scholar dying in remonstration—once turbid emotions surge, acting rashly, there's utterly nothing to be done.

Attain concentration through discipline; from concentration, attain attachment. Gradually approaching the natural state through effort; refining essence to transform it into energy; refining energy to transform it into spirit. What dregs or impurities could there be in purity and emptiness?

A grand and clear state of mind, yet expressed in simple language. The essence of an entire Buddhist scripture is exhausted in these few words.

Discipline oneself with an autumn air; handle affairs with a spring air.

Mr. Yu Cai's poem says: "Having experienced the solemnity of autumn descending upon the world, daring to leave spring's warmth on the tip of my brush." It's precisely the opposite situation.

The style of poetry and prose is best when it possesses an autumn air. The style of lyrics and songs is best when it possesses a spring air.

It is even better to be able to blend both airs, expanding and contracting, yielding and controlling as desired. Only by possessing both styles and interweaving the two airs can one achieve the combined beauty of strength and tenderness.

It is best to view a woman's morning makeup after she has applied powder. (Continued sentence) It is best to view a woman's evening makeup before she removes it.

I wonder if in a previous life, during the Spring and Autumn period, I ever knew Xi Shi? During the Jin Dynasty, did I ever see Wei Jie? During the Yi Xi era, did I ever get drunk with Yuanming? During the Tianbao era, did I ever behold Tai Zhen? During the Yuanfeng reign, did I ever meet Dongpo? Throughout the ages, those longed for are not limited to these few. But these few are the most prominent. Therefore, I mention them to represent the rest.

Limitless infatuation, truly a heartrending utterance that moves even stubborn beings. Yet, "The same heart feels the same emotions for thousands of years." It is not necessary to meet face to face, nor to pour out one's heart with sincerity. Hearts have long resonated, and spirits have understood.

I also wonder if, during the Longqing and Wanli periods, I ever socialized with several courtesans in the myriad courtyards? Did Mei Gong, Bohu, Ruoshi, and the gentlemen of Chishui ever share laughter and conversation with me? In the vast universe, whom should I ask now?

The heart connects with the divine; why bother lamenting being born in different eras? The mind's fast is truly for the infatuated!

Flowers should not be seen as they fall. The moon should not be seen as it sinks. Beautiful women should not be seen as they decline.

Endless infatuation, limitless tenderness—truly the heartfelt expressions of a talented individual with piercing insight.

### ### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Dongfeng

Pingzi's words, however, wounded Tsurumi's dignity: "A dignified man, actually needing a woman to protect him!" He thought, only then recovering from the confusion caused by Pingzi's antics, and regaining his senses; recognizing that Pingzi's car was not taking him to the New Green Building, but speeding towards the outskirts; under the streetlights, he could barely see cars, horses, or pedestrians.

"Where are you going, Pingzi?" Tsurumi raised a hand, pressing it on Pingzi's jade arm.

"Taking you to the Taisei Shrine, Big Brother!" Pingzi's tone seemed "a matter of course," as if Tsurumi's question was redundant.

"No!" Tsurumi, like a lion just awakened, shook his head and roared: "I don't need to go to any shrine... Just let me out of the car, Nakamura, Sister!" As he spoke, he increased the force on his arm, forcibly turning the steering wheel, causing the car to swerve off the road and almost onto the sidewalk.

"Be patient, Big Brother!" Pingzi gently extended her fair wrist, using a maneuver to break free of Tsurumi's arm. She straightened the steering wheel, and the car returned to its path, while she still calmly and peacefully said: "If you don't believe me, please turn around and look at what it's like on the road we came from!" Pingzi, even in this instance, did not speak with a smile.

At this moment, Tsurumi was quite surprised; he never knew that such a delicate and graceful Pingzi had such great strength; with a light flick, she had actually shaken off his arm. Although the force wasn't fierce, it had a hidden strength, an irresistible hidden strength. It's clear that the previous time they first met, when Pingzi sent a message with her fingers in the car, asking Tsurumi to teach her jujutsu, it was simply a joke. (See Chapter Six).

The second thing that alarmed Tsurumi was that he heard the words "what it's like on the road we came from" spoken so seriously. He indeed turned his head and looked out the rear window; for a moment, he forgot that there was someone sitting on the back seat, blocking his view; although he didn't see his back, he saw on the rear of the car, besides the "08" boar, another young woman sitting. That woman happened to be looking down into the car at that moment—perhaps because the car had almost driven onto the sidewalk just now. Under the bright streetlights, it was clear that the woman's face was tightly drawn, as if holding back anger. However, she was a stranger whom Tsurumi had never seen before.

What surprised Tsurumi even more was that he turned his head, peered out the window, and looked behind the car; he saw a convertible car on this road, speeding after them from a distance of about two hundred meters. Five or six strong men were sitting in the car; although the distance was too far, and he couldn't see their features clearly, judging by their appearance, it was clear that they were standard samurai.

"Hey, who on earth are they?" Tsurumi muttered to himself.

### On "Life in this World"

— Ji Yong

Recently, Mr. Wu Shichang had an article on "Observation," discussing the clichés in compositions by middle school and college students, mostly beginning with phrases like "The wheels of time..." and "Since the War of Resistance..." It's just like twenty years ago, when middle school students would start with "Life in this world" and "Between the two great events of life." Mr. Wu calls this a reflection of accumulated psychological pressure.

Thinking about it carefully, even being able to produce such clichés is already good, because at least there's a "tune" to it. In reality, today's middle school student compositions start with "grammatical errors." What can we even talk about in terms of "style" or "tune"! Some people complain that perhaps if things continue like this for another thirty years, no one in China will be able to write a coherent sentence in their own language. Whether this is true or not, we'll have to wait and see in thirty years, but there's no way to know for sure right now, so I'll stop worrying about it. Instead, let's talk about the origins of these so-called clichés.

Saying that middle school student compositions are clichés is actually unfair. We should start by looking at the speeches, talks, and press conferences of important people. Even a convicted corrupt official, when taking office, loudly proclaimed the need to reduce the burden on the people, didn't he? It was even more incredible when it came to cracking down on hoarding, punishing unscrupulous merchants, and suppressing smuggling. Almost every day, there were "high-minded arguments" taking up large chunks of newspaper space that no one wanted to read and no one believed. Aren't these the same as "Life in this world"? The person reading the composition gets a headache when they see "the wheels of time," but they still have to grit their teeth and keep reading. Ordinary people, however, aren't obligated to do this. They just toss the newspaper aside, or pick it up and flip straight to the "social news," paying attention to stories about Zhang Chunfan, the double-gun bandit, getting married in the air, and so on. —The rise of small newspapers is precisely because of this.

In the past, people used the eight-legged essay as a stepping stone. Once the door was open, the brick was thrown away. Nowadays, these newly emerging eight-legged essays are not stepping stones. Opening the door requires other, more effective tools. Just the brick alone definitely won't work. So, what is it? It turns out to be advertising, or a smokescreen, or, as they say in Beijing, "selling ointment." However, advertising is "believe it or not, buy it or not, it's up to you." There's complete freedom. The eight-legged essay, however, is persistently insistent. You not only have to accept it, but you also have to say it's "absolutely the best."

As the saying goes, "The grass bends to the wind." Those above like something, and those below must like it even more. The great men are selling their own ointment in this way, and students naturally and unconsciously keep turning the wheels of time. But these are the great men of the future. When their era comes, won't they be forever selling that same all-powerful but utterly ineffective water-based ointment in an endless cycle?

Alas! "Life in this world..."

### Having Tea with George Bernard Shaw

— Daoxian

Maurice Evans, a Broadway stage director and actor, visited George Bernard Shaw in England not long ago to discuss royalties for staging Shaw's romantic comedy "Man and Superman" in the United States. Although Shaw was ninety-one years old, he was still energetic, his voice full of strength and beauty. He spoke at length with Evans about drama, acting, and Truman and Wallace. After returning to the United States, Evans wrote an article, "Having Tea with Shaw," which was published in the "This Week Magazine" section of the New York Herald Tribune.

George Bernard Shaw lived in Ayot St Lawrence in Hertfordshire. He had printed a route map specifically for visiting guests. It told you which road to take from London, where to go north, then turn left, go through a small road, then turn right, and so on, stating that it would take an hour and a quarter to get to Shaw's house from London. Evans clutched this map tightly in his hand, turning left and right, getting completely disoriented, and finally took more than two and a half hours to arrive. If it hadn't been for the warm, welcoming smile of the small Irish maid who opened the door, he would have almost suspected that this twisting and turning road was one of Shaw's pranks.

After being announced by Shaw's secretary, Miss Patch, Shaw walked out of his study, his face covered with a white beard as stiff as porcupine quills. He was leaning on a cane. Shaw's eyes were deeply sunken, but under his thick eyebrows, they still flashed with a mocking light. The red pigment in his hair and beard seemed to have gathered on his nose now, making him look a bit like the clown he called himself. His clothing also still showed a kind of personality: an old green tweed jacket, knee-length breeches.

Evans followed Shaw to the living room. To his surprise, Shaw's house was small and a bit uncomfortable. The living room was cluttered with antiques and furniture, showing that its owner was too busy and deeply lacked extravagance.

The Irish maid brought in tea, but Shaw had a large cup of strange beverage in front of him. It was a cold, rainy day, and Evans and Shaw sat close to a small portable electric heater to warm themselves. From this, one can see the difficult situation in Britain today; even a figure like Shaw, only because of his old age, was granted special permission to use such a small electric heater. The room where Shaw worked used to be heated very warmly, but now he could only use this small electric heater to warm himself, and he always kept the heater so close to his side that the housekeeper often worried that the blanket on his lap would catch fire.

"You want to stage 'Man and Superman'," Shaw suddenly said. Evans was caught off guard and was so surprised that he almost dropped his teacup. "Good, you can perform it, but you have to remember—you must stage it quickly. Although this play has always been a hit, I don't want it to be staged in the United States during a presidential election year. —You know, the competition is too fierce."

Evans took the opportunity to ask Shaw for his opinion on the 1948 American presidential candidates.

He said, "It's hard to say. Truman and Attlee are the same. They have done much better than we initially expected. However, since the war, among the Americans who have come to Britain, only Wallace's conversations have not been as mediocre as a villager."

Evans felt that this was Shaw's strategy to provoke a debate, so he didn't continue. He got back to the topic and asked Shaw for his opinion on royalties.

Shaw suddenly seemed tense as he sat in his chair, saying with an Irish accent, "Everyone asks for a lot of money from the theater. I have not changed my conditions for fifty years, and they are unchangeable." (Note: Shaw's royalty rate is 15% of the ticket price.)

Regarding the staging of his plays, Shaw made a definitive statement: "Modern actors are afraid to perform my plays."

Shaw probably meant that actors are afraid to recite the lines in his plays, because Shaw writes his plays in rhyming prose, which is almost poetry.

After signing the contract, Shaw sent Evans off bareheaded in the rain, fully revealing the warmth of this literary giant.

### Seriousness

— Naizi

A prisoner escaped from a jail in a certain small town in the United States. The local police chief immediately sent six photos of the escaped prisoner in different poses to the police chief of a neighboring town. A few hours later, he received a reply stating:

"Five of the escaped prisoners have been captured. Expected sixth prisoner can be apprehended within a few hours."

### Between Life and Death

— Jieding

In the past few days, the Chao Hui Villa has seen a tragic scene of living people seizing houses from the dead. Groups of refugees broke into the villa, moved away the coffins of the dead, and moved in themselves, numbering over a thousand. As a result, some people thought that the ancestors were not at peace and felt that the refugees were unreasonable.

According to traditional Chinese ethical concepts, when parents died, sons were required to "live in a hut" for three years by their parents' graves in the wilderness, abandoning all affairs of the living to accompany the dead in "sleeping." The dead were so much more important than the living. Even today, the phrase "parents' burial has not yet been settled" can cause children to lose their appetite and sleep, making it impossible for them to "live" properly. When a person is born, the parents do their best to raise the child, and they can even hit and scold the child to vent their anger. But when it comes to the dead (including one's own dead children), there must be no disrespect. They must be respectful, lying in state for three days, put in a coffin, the burial site must be selected, and the grave must be dug, and there must be sacrifices and celebrations for the deceased... Some people even spend their entire fortune on funerals, leaving the living unable to survive. Judging from this degree of importance attached to the dead, it is certainly an unforgivable crime for the living to seize the houses of the dead.

But even if people value the dead so much, this world is still the world of the living. On Nanjing Road, people rushing around in offices and exchanges, setting up stalls, filing lawsuits, begging from door to door, are all living people. If a dead person were found moving, it would simply be a world-shattering event.

Looking at the land in the countryside, especially in the suburbs, the amount of land occupied by burial mounds is enormous. In the cities, the houses of associations and villas are better than those of the poor and destitute, who have nowhere to live, sleeping on the streets with crying children and wives, which is heartbreaking to see. Compared to the comfort of the dead, it is a great irony.

For the living to live a decent life—at least to have a basic condition for survival—the rich should give up some of their excessive luxury to help the poor survive, let alone the dead?

### Rambling Talk about Shop Signs

— Yifeng

When a villager suddenly steps into a "modernized" metropolis, especially places like Beijing and Shanghai, the feeling of novelty they experience is no less than that of Granny Liu entering the Grand View Garden. The most obvious things, such as the colorful neon lights, the long queues of people waiting for buses, and the sales slogans like "Great Discounts" and "Big Sacrifices"... all give them the feeling of being "overwhelmed by the sights along the road."

Especially those sales slogans like "Great Discounts" and the extraordinarily exaggerated advertisements with beautiful women, the attraction to a villager is indeed quite large, perhaps leading them to reluctantly spend their money, becoming a so-called "bumpkin" once, twice, or three times. However, those who are a little more discerning will realize that these are nothing but the merchants' beautiful lies, just "shop signs." Because "pursuing a tenth of profit" is every merchant's natural law. No one will do business at a loss, and no one is willing to be a fool who truly makes a "big sacrifice" that "doesn't spare the capital." Therefore, those who display "Great Discounts" are just doing that sort of thing. In this way, the term "shop sign" unconsciously becomes a disguised way of "creating falsehoods" in the general public's subconscious. In reality, it's quite an unfair thing.

What is a "shop sign"? Tracing back to its origins, everyone knows that it's a tool used by merchants to attract customers and promote goods. Its role is absolutely not limited to advertisements that exaggerate to the extreme. In ancient times, it was mostly used to showcase the actual goods in an honest and straightforward manner. Today, in some old commercial towns and cities, this practice of using real objects as shop signs still exists, especially in the northern towns. However, even in the modernized metropolises, traces of it still remain. For example, utensil stores hanging actual objects like pots and pans in front of their doors, comb stores hanging large wooden combs on their eaves, and clock and watch stores and shoe stores hanging wooden clock faces and boot pictures on their eaves. These physical and symbolic "shop signs" are, of course, very old-fashioned in the eyes of those who think they are outdated; however, their role is still to make it clear to customers at a glance. Although it is silent on the surface, without flowery advertisements, it also won't incur the hatred of those who have been deceived by advertising!

However, once this "shop sign" that originated in the commercial field spreads to corners outside the commercial field, it becomes a great misfortune. Moreover, in today's world where the wind of "spreading falsehoods" is rampant, the wonderful use of "shop signs" has greatly increased. How can one not be surprised that those who "hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat" are everywhere?

### Getting Promoted Like This

— Wang Baili

When Emperor Muzong of Tang was the crown prince, he heard that Li Ting had a fine horse, but he couldn't get it. When he ascended the throne, he said, "Li Ting didn't give me his horse, so his integrity is clear and he can be trusted." He then appointed him as a general. The History of Ming Dynasty mentions that when Yang Pu was prime minister, his son came from Shishou and described the gifts and hospitality he received from the officials of the counties he passed through. Only Fan Li, the magistrate of Jiangling, was not very polite. Pu was surprised and later learned of his virtue. He was then appointed to be the prefect of De'an Prefecture and then promoted to the position of Chief Administrator of Guizhou. Someone advised Li to write a letter of thanks, but Li said, "The prime minister is using people for the court, not for personal reasons. What is there to thank?" Later, upon hearing of Pu's death, he held a sacrifice and mourned for him to thank him for understanding him. Such appointments, based on words and character, all came from purity and without any bias, and are all worthy of emulation by later generations. Especially the case of giving favor to those who don't give to me is rare throughout history, both at home and abroad, which is why it is so difficult. But if this were to happen today, it would likely be labeled as a "big deal". As for the South History: Biography of Liu Jinyi, it roughly says, "Yuan Xing was base and vulgar, but he was intimate with Emperor Xiaowu. The Emperor doted on Consort Yin, who died. After she was buried, he still visited her tomb with his ministers. One day, he turned to Yuan and said, 'If you cry for the late Consort Yin with sadness, I will reward you handsomely.' Xing immediately wailed loudly, stomping his feet and crying bitterly. The Emperor was pleased and made him the Governor of Yuzhou." Getting promoted like this is truly unprecedented! Absurdity and shamelessness gathered in one place. To seek national peace and the people's prosperity is truly a dream!

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Four, Two Hearts in Harmony (16)

At this moment, the waiter brought up the third course. Qi Wan cut the steak with a knife, saying, "I think women are like this steak, delicious and ready to be slaughtered. You men are the ones holding the knives, able to choose as you please." Zhu Zhai smiled slightly, shaking his head. Qi Wan asked, "You don't agree with what I said?" Zhu Zhai said, "You see men too harshly. You don't know that men also have their own sufferings. The most important thing in a relationship between men and women is that their spirits can be comforted. If their spirits can be comforted, they can understand each other. If they can understand each other, love will naturally grow stronger day by day. Take my wife, for example. I don't need to mention whether she's beautiful or not, but in terms of common sense, she doesn't understand anything. Her mind is only filled with oil, salt, wine, and soy sauce. What she says is unbearably vulgar. How can I get along with her? I only feel pain with her. I can't get a single bit of comfort in my spirit." Qi Wan laughed, "Having such a virtuous housekeeper at home allows you to have no worries about the inner affairs. Are you still not satisfied?" Zhu Zhai said, "That's the view from fifty years ago. It doesn't fit with the times anymore." Qi Wan listened, glancing at Zhu Zhai, saying, "As the saying goes, 'A clever woman often sleeps with a clumsy man.' You're not clumsy, and she's not clever. It's exactly the opposite." She laughed as she said this, and Zhu Zhai couldn't help but laugh with her. Qi Wan added, "What I just said was all outdated. Please don't take offense!" Zhu Zhai said, "I hope you don't take offense. My wife was at the show last night. She didn't know what was important and said nonsense. I'm sure Little Wang's mother told you everything as a joke. There's really nothing I can do!" Qi Wan's eyes widened, showing a very strange expression, saying, "What do you mean? How can I blame you—does she know what kind of relationship I have with you?" After saying this, Qi Wan immediately felt that her words were too much. Her face suddenly turned red, and she lowered her head almost to the plate, smiling softly. Seeing her innocent and adorable appearance, and hearing her sweet words, Zhu Zhai's heart blossomed. He was only hindered by the waiter bringing in the coffee. Otherwise, he would have prostrated himself to thank the beauty for her discerning eyes. After having coffee, Qi Wan said, "I felt very happy talking today. It's still early. Let's take a walk somewhere." Zhu Zhai said, "Zhongnanhai Park is the closest. Shall we go to the park?" Qi Wan said, "That's fine. Zhongnanhai Park is relatively quiet. I haven't been there in a long time." Zhu Zhai hurried to pay the bill, but Qi Wan said, "What are you busy with? I've already paid." The waiter brought the bill, along with the remaining change. Qi Wan gave it all to him as a tip. The waiter thanked her repeatedly and hailed a car for them. The two went together to Zhongnanhai Park. At this time, the sun was setting, and the remaining light gradually disappeared. Twilight gathered in the park. A few scattered electric lights cast a weak glow. A light breeze caused ripples to rise in the Taiye Pond. Along the shore, sparse trees rustled, with yellow leaves falling on them. Zhu Zhai stroked Qi Wan's arm and said, "You're wearing so little. Are you cold?"

### Xie Bingying's Loneliness

— Lü Baihua

Asking for wonders not separated by a green gauze curtain, scolding catkins transformed into purple border clouds; this female hero is particularly lonely, news comes from beyond the sky.

Those who have read "A Woman Soldier's Ten Years" know that Bingying is a female hero. Heroes are bold and unrestrained, but I think the more bold and unrestrained a hero is, the more lonely they will feel. She said, "Like a heavily loaded camel, tiredly marching forward without end." Treacherous roads in the world, vicissitudes of human affairs, the pressures of life have made her lonely. She also said, "I want to go to the gentle Jiangnan again," but she still hasn't come. Yes, the weather in Jiangnan is somewhat milder, but in terms of the roads of the world and human affairs, it is a year-round severe winter!

### A Happy Family

— Luo Ta

"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This is the first sentence of Tolstoy's book, Anna Karenina.

So, what does a happy family look like? Prompted by the huge advertisements in the daily newspapers for milk powder, cod liver oil, wool yarn, silk stockings, and aided by my own imagination, I construct this picture of a happy and fulfilling family:

The best season is deep winter, and the best time is evening, because only winter nights most easily reveal a family's happiness or unhappiness.

In a neatly and cleanly arranged room, seated in two sofa chairs in front of a burning fireplace are the father and mother. The father leans back in his chair, intently reading the evening paper. The mother sits upright, carefully winding a ball of wool yarn, preparing to knit a vest or gloves. Standing in front of her is a daughter of about twelve or thirteen years old, a large loop of yarn stretched between her outstretched hands. Judging by the curvature of the yarn hanging down between her hands, it can be seen that she, like girls everywhere, is clever enough to know to relax her hands, allowing the yarn to slip off loop by loop. If it were a boy of the same age, it wouldn't work; he would put all his strength into stretching the yarn taut, like a violin string, or like the countless wires between two electrical poles. Of course, behind the sister is a younger brother, no more than a year or two younger than her. He knows nothing but to rock back and forth on his wooden horse.

At the doorway stands a nanny, in her early thirties, carrying in milk, coffee, or cocoa (depending on whose advertisement it is). This nanny, though not possessing the beauty to topple cities or states, has regular features and a refined appearance. Her clothes, while not elaborate, are neat and clean from head to toe.

This is the uniform picture of a happy family. Although it may sometimes seem a bit dull and trite, it is, after all, happy and enviable, and I would very much like to join in.

However, I hope this picture stays just as it is, and doesn't move at all, because if it does, things will go wrong. Needless to say, an atomic bomb falling, stocks plummeting, or a bank collapsing could completely destroy this picture. But even if the father, sitting and reading the newspaper, were to suddenly have a whim, put down the paper, and glance at the nanny entering the room or make a funny face, and the mother happened to see it, she might throw down the ball of yarn and pounce, knocking the sister and brother over, the nanny spilling milk and coffee all over the place...

You see, as soon as that happens, the family's happiness is over! "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This is the end of a uniform picture of a happy family, and the beginning of a novel describing one of countless kinds of unhappy families.

And "Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys' house. The wife had discovered that the husband..." is also the beginning of Tolstoy's novel.

### Getting Rid of the Old and Welcoming the New

— Tong Tuo

This day, we were happily saying that Lao Zhang, Lao Wang, Xiao Sun, and myself, four people in total, left the office and went straight to Zhengxing Restaurant for a big meal. Before leaving, I carefully tidied up my desk, putting things that should be kept on my person, such as a small knife, fountain pen, wallet, and lighter, into my pockets. I put on my coat and left leisurely. After 5:30 p.m., the streets were filled with crowds of people eager to return home. We weaved our way through the crowds, finally making our way through Henan Road and arriving at Zhengxing Restaurant. Zhengxing Restaurant has gradually learned to focus on cleanliness. In the past, there were greasy tables, black and dirty bamboo chopsticks, and a dilapidated building... This time, the place was completely transformed, arranged cleanly. The roof had been freshly painted, with a snow-white ceiling. Fluorescent lights had replaced electric lights, and the tables were covered with snow-white tablecloths. Bamboo chopsticks had long been discarded and replaced with imitation ivory chopsticks. It is said that old restaurants like this are frequented by a special group of customers, so they had no choice but to improve.

After we were full of food and drink, we left together, walking leisurely back to our residences. After sitting down, it was time to take out my pen to write something, but alas, the fountain pen that I had carefully placed was gone. I searched all my pockets, but couldn't find it. After thinking carefully, it must have been taken by a nimble pickpocket in the chaotic crowd earlier. Besides blaming myself for not being careful and the thief's skill, what else can I say? My old Parker, which had been with me for ten years, was separated from me like this. Besides being annoyed, there was also a sense of loss.

Having no choice, I bought a new one, still a "Parker." Fortunately, the new pen flowed more smoothly than the old one. I gladly considered myself a revolutionary, "Without destruction, how can there be construction?" Now my pen has been destroyed, but at least I have "constructed" a new pen. I thought that in this shy time, I actually had the spirit of getting rid of the old and welcoming the new, with a bit of the Shanghai "tough" style, and I couldn't help but feel pleased with myself for having a "revolutionary spirit." However, the problem lies in going to restaurants; the ancient saying "it is not auspicious to eat away from home" should be torn up now.
