### National Army Units in Henan Recover Fengqiu and Yanjin, People of Anyang Await Rescue from Dire Straits

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 12th] The National Army in eastern Henan won a victory. A detachment of the remnant forces of Jin Shaoshan, a bandit located seven kilometers northeast of Qixian, was surrounded and completely annihilated by the National Army on the 11th, killing more than 1,000 Communist officers, including a regimental commander, and capturing more than 300.

[Central News Agency Xinxiang, 12th] A unit of the National Army recovered the county seats of Fengqiu and Yanjin at noon on the 11th. The Communist Li Jingyi's local Eighth Route Army's 14th, 15th, 16th, and 29th Regiments sneaked into the Jiaohuyan area of Hua County. Currently, there are no traces of Communist troops south of Niushitun.

[Another Dispatch] Today, hundreds of thousands of kind-hearted compatriots in Anyang are enduring hunger and fear, hoping that the government will send reinforcements to lift the siege and provide food to save their tragic fate with an urgent feeling that each day feels like a year. There are currently more than 200,000 refugees in the city, and 220,000 refugees outside the city within the three-mile gap leading to the Communist-controlled area. The war has divided them into two groups: refugees inside the city cannot go out, and refugees outside the city cannot enter the city or escape the Communist blockade. Under these circumstances, the food problem for the residents in the city is extremely serious, but there may still be relatives who can share food. Those who are camping out in the open are on the verge of starvation, and stray bullets flying from all directions can cause death at any time. The tragic situation cannot be described in words. The composition of the refugees includes some who are from Anyang, and some who have fled from various counties in southern Hebei and northern Henan, who are also those whom the Communists will not forgive. Apart from looking south and praying for early rescue, they have no other way to survive. As for the civilians outside the city, they are being subjected to two different treatments. The Communists west of the railway, in order to create hatred, ordered each village to deliver a certain number of corpses every day, regardless of whether the dead were male or female, rich or poor, to meet the quota; otherwise, the village chief would be subjected to the cruel torture of "red boiling" or "white boiling." The so-called "red boiling" is to dismember the person's limbs and then boil them to death in a pot. "White boiling" is to slowly boil a living person from the feet to the head until the person dies and the flesh dissolves, leaving only white bones. East of the railway, people are still being extorted for civilian guns. When representatives from Anyang described the situation in Anyang to reporters, they were all in tears and deeply saddened. How to lift the siege of Anyang as soon as possible, and how to transport food before the siege is lifted, has become an extremely urgent matter today.

### Strengthen the Rule of Law to Seek Progress and Prosperity, Taiwan Provincial Government Established on Friday, Wei Daoming Arrives in Shanghai Today to Transfer to Taiwan to Take Office

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] The newly appointed Chairman of Taiwan Province, Wei Daoming, is scheduled to leave Nanjing by plane for Shanghai in the afternoon of the 13th, stay for one day, and fly to Taiwan on the 15th. The Taiwan Provincial Government will be formally established on the 16th. The swearing-in ceremony of Chairman Wei and the person in charge of the oath ceremony have not yet been decided. Wei visited Chief Executive Chen Yi on the 12th to discuss the recent situation in Taiwan Province and Chen's plans and policies for governing Taiwan, in order to understand the actual situation. However, Wei believes that everything can only be comprehensively planned after arriving in Taiwan. He met with reporters at Wang Chonghui's residence and replied to reporters' inquiries: I believe that in order to get politics on track, we must first seek social security and economic stability. My future work will focus on strengthening the rule of law and following the instructions of the central government as a guide. Wei then emphasized several points as follows: (1) The education problem focuses on exchange, that is, transferring professors from the mainland to Taiwan and sending students to the mainland for education, so as to achieve the effect of cultural exchange. (2) From political democratization to economic democratization, so that Taiwan's industry can coordinate with the mainland's industry to harmonize supply and demand. Finally, Wei stated: All those who go with me this time are excellent people and have considerable confidence in governing Taiwan.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 12th] The newly appointed Chairman of Taiwan Province, Wei Daoming, said: He does not intend to express any opinions. His visits to the Chairman these days have focused on the need to prosper Taiwan Province. In order to achieve this goal, he is determined to attach importance to stability, and only in stability can progress and prosperity be achieved. He does not intend to change the monetary system in Taiwan Province, and will give economic freedom under the principle of not harming economic stability. In the past, during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, although certain industrial constructions had a considerable foundation, this was nothing more than the way imperialism exploited our Taiwanese compatriots. The Taiwanese people could only obtain the most basic standard of living, and all the benefits were enjoyed by the Japanese. In the future, the development of Taiwan's economy should focus on the welfare of the public, so that the results of prosperity can be enjoyed by the public, so as to improve their living standards. Taiwan's existing industry is a tool used by the Japanese to carry out their industrial auxiliary policies, and in the future, its direction should be changed to make Taiwan Province a component of the country's overall economy, cooperating with each other.

It is generally believed that not only will Zhangjiakou and Taiyuan's two Pacification Headquarters cooperate closely in the future to salvage the situation in Shanxi, but Fu is also very likely to directly participate in planning the defense of Taiyuan. According to reports, Fu became famous for firmly defending Zhuozhou during the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in the 16th year of the Republic [1927].

### Our Country's Diplomatic Personnel System: Director Yin Discusses the Establishment of a Good Foundation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Our country's diplomatic personnel system has recently established a good foundation, moving towards the right track, and can serve as a model for other administrative personnel systems. Formal diplomatic officials engaged in foreign affairs have also obtained considerable professional security. Diplomatic administrative personnel and embassy and consulate staff below the rank of Jianren are all selected through examination, and the principle of "internal and external rotation" is gradually being implemented. On the 12th, a reporter visited Yin Baoyu, the former director of personnel at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who explained the current diplomatic personnel system as follows: The appointment of diplomatic personnel is currently based on selections from those who have passed the government's higher and ordinary examinations. To supplement the shortage of talent obtained through the national examination system, the Ministry established a "Nominee Selection Committee" in 1941 to hold regular examinations and select talent to supplement the previous recommendation method. Currently, except for Jianren officials, staff below the rank of specialist and section chief who enter the diplomatic service must pass the committee's examination. The Examination Yuan and the Ministry of Civil Service are consulted to improve and establish the system, which is gradually being implemented. Yin continued that the principle of internal and external rotation of diplomatic personnel was personally established by Chairman Chiang when he concurrently served as the minister, aiming to enable domestic and overseas personnel to have a thorough understanding of their duties and to achieve a balance between theory and practice. Personnel sent overseas are assigned for a term of three years, while those in tropical and frigid zones are assigned for two terms of two years. After the term expires, they are rotated between internal and external positions as much as possible. Due to transportation issues during the war, this was not fully realized, but it is now being gradually implemented. Regarding the current situation of rotation, Yin stated that embassies and consulates in various regions have resumed operations after the war. Because China's international status has increased compared to before the war, many countries have established new diplomatic relations with us, and the number of embassies and consulates has increased accordingly. China's diplomatic authorities have always placed emphasis on protecting overseas Chinese. Some overseas regions where overseas Chinese have suffered from the impact of the war are awaiting government protection, especially Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. The government has established many consulates in these areas after the war, and the number of personnel sent to overseas consulates has also increased accordingly. In addition, international conferences have become frequent in recent years, so the number of personnel actually sent overseas is far greater than those transferred internally. When the reporter finally inquired about the issue of career security for diplomatic officials, Yin replied that those who enter the diplomatic service through examination will not be dismissed by their superiors for any reason unless there is a specific fault. Overseas personnel cannot be transferred during their term unless there are special reasons. In addition, the heads of consulates currently sent abroad are all experienced individuals who have served in foreign missions, with the aim of enhancing the ability of each consul to respond to situations. It is noted that Yin Baoyu has now been transferred to serve as the Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and his vacancy will be filled by Yu Nengmo.

### Regarding the Plan for Reparations from Japan, the U.S. Refutes Soviet Accusations; Japan Can Hardly Accept the Demands of the Allied Nations

[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] A broadcast from Moscow's shortwave radio revealed that the Soviet Union's policy, which it insisted on at the Moscow Conference, that reparations based on current industrial production should be a condition for signing a peace treaty, will also be applied to the Japanese peace treaty issue. The commentary, broadcast in English by Simirnov, stated: "A portion of Japanese industry, especially the arms industry, needs to be completely destroyed, while another portion can be used for peaceful production and should supply reparations. According to the provisions of the peace treaty, the transfer of Japanese industrial equipment and a portion of Japan's current industrial production to Pacific nations as reparations within a certain period can help restore countries that were damaged in the war." The broadcast did not mention the Soviet Union's reparations demands, but only pointed out that the United States intends to allocate most of the reparations to countries economically connected to the United States.

The broadcast also reiterated its attacks on the U.S. occupation policy and reparations plan, pointing out that 500 Japanese factories originally listed for reparations, including 24 underground aircraft factories, have been removed from the list. This plan is actually part of the U.S.'s plan to transform Japan into a "U.S. military strategic and economic base."

A spokesman for the Allied General Headquarters' Industrial Division stated: He does not know where the Soviet Union obtained the list of factories for reparations that were removed. The Far Eastern Commission intends to use over a thousand factories for reparations, but less than half have been completely confirmed to date. The Soviet Union has raised the same issue several times, and the Allied General Headquarters previously informed Derevyanko (head of the Soviet delegation to Japan) that the removal of some factories only removed their "name" but not their "reality." For example, the equipment in underground aircraft factories is easily damaged by humidity, so it was moved to above-ground warehouses. Or, factory names may be repeated on the list, or they may have been completely destroyed by bombing, so they were naturally canceled. One arms factory was removed because it actually manufactured telephone equipment, which is needed by the occupation authorities. Fewer than ten factories were truly removed because allocating them for reparations would affect Japan's national economy, but 25 factories were added to the list.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 12th] Well-informed sources in the Allied nations announced today: The total amount of reparations demands that countries related to Japan have already made or will make will reach a huge sum of several hundred billion U.S. dollars, which Japan's domestic and foreign assets cannot afford. When asked if a long-term repayment method could be used, a well-informed source replied: What was the result of the Allied nations demanding long-term reparations from Germany after the last World War?

### Almost All Looted Items in Japan Were Stolen from Our Country; Representatives of Various Countries Advocate House-to-House Searches

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Wu Bannong, head of the reparations group of our delegation to Japan, has returned after inspecting Japanese-looted items in various places with other Allied representatives. He believes that very few items have been seen. The Allied General Headquarters ordered the Japanese government to report the situation of looted items in detail, but Japan clearly did not comply. He believes that museums, libraries, and private collections should all be investigated, and reparations work should be accelerated, as we have only touched the surface of the problem so far. Wu said: Warehouses in Tokyo, Fukuoka, Osaka, and Nagoya have all been inspected. He saw many bronze bells and stone lions looted from China, and 95 percent of the looted items came from China, with the remainder being specialties from various parts of the South Seas. Wu will travel to Hokkaido with representatives from other countries at the end of this month to conduct an investigation.

[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] Abrella, head of the Philippine reparations and restitution delegation to Japan, recently said: He wants to implement "house-to-house" inspections in Japan to recover items looted by the Japanese during the war. Abrella recently returned from searching for stolen goods in southern Japan and said: "Japan looted items from house to house in the Philippines. The only proper way for us to find these items is to implement house-to-house searches." He also said: He was greatly disappointed with the quantity of looted items announced by the Japanese in accordance with the orders of the Allied General Headquarters. Du克莱斯脱, head of the French reparations and restitution delegation here, said: He also expressed disappointment and believes that the Allied General Headquarters should issue an order imposing severe penalties on Japanese who violate the order and refuse to hand over looted items. The residences of important Japanese figures and former naval and army personnel should be immediately searched. Those who conceal looted items and are discovered must be punished, and examples must be set to serve as a warning, so that Japanese will no longer violate the order and conceal them. Officials of the Allied General Headquarters also said: The Japanese have concealed several billion U.S. dollars worth of looted items, and very few have been handed over.

Editorial

### New Developments in the Korean Situation

The Korean issue had attracted world attention on the eve of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. At that time, news about the Korean situation was scattered in newspapers around the world. The return of General Hodge, commander of the US military in South Korea, and his remarks had aroused attention from all sides. In addition, Dr. Syngman Rhee, the leader of the Korean revolution, visited the United States, and news about how the United States would support South Korea was repeatedly published in newspapers. Therefore, for a time, the world's eyes were somewhat focused on the Korean Peninsula. As the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference approached, the general speculation was that General Marshall would raise the issue of the Korean situation. The world has placed ardent hopes on the development of the Korean situation; the development of the Korean situation can be used to gauge the development of US-Soviet relations; and whether US-Soviet relations can be harmonious is the key to maintaining world peace. Therefore, when General Marshall raised the issue of the Korean situation after the meeting began, no matter how stern his wording was, the world did not feel strange, because they all had a premonition that this was an inevitable element. What the world cares about is the Soviet response. Now, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has replied to the US Secretary of State, expressing his willingness to accept the US proposal to reopen the Joint Commission in Korea to establish a basis for democratic unification in Korea. The transmission of this news seems to give the world a new hope for the development of the Korean situation; as if in the future the Korean situation, the Soviet Union has bowed to the United States, and the development of the Korean situation will inevitably tend to be simpler.

What we must first point out here is that if anyone thinks that the Soviet Union has accepted the US proposal for Korea, and that the Korean situation can be stabilized from now on, and that the unification of a democratic Korea can be achieved, this seems to be an illusion. We have no opportunity to read the original text of Molotov's reply to the US Secretary of State; we have no way to speculate on the wording of the reply. According to news reports, Molotov's reply agreed that all democratic parties should be involved in the Korean provisional government. It stated: "To my understanding, your proposal is to establish the conditions for negotiations with various Korean democratic parties and social groups before the Joint Commission resumes. This issue is also the subject of discussions between the US and Soviet commanders in Korea, and their opinions are quite close." As of this writing, we have not yet seen the US government's attitude towards the Soviet reply, so we have no way to deduce the US official intentions. However, according to news agency reports from Washington, the US government intends to revise its economic assistance program for Korea, and if the unification negotiations are successful, it intends to include both North and South Korea in the economic assistance program; and it is said that the Soviet Union's acceptance of the US proposal represents a psychological victory for the Truman Doctrine. It can be seen that the Soviet reply has already had a considerable effect in the United States.

The development of the Korean situation to the present stage, the problem is not entirely in the 38th parallel. From the viewpoint of forming a unified Korean regime, this involves the decision made by the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference regarding the Korean trusteeship, and the attitudes of the various Korean political groups towards the Moscow trusteeship decision. From the standpoint of the Korean people, it is understandable to oppose the trusteeship decision. The rule of the Japanese warlords in Korea has never eliminated the Korean people's national consciousness: now that the Japanese warlords have collapsed, it is the moment for the Korean nation to revive. They are eager for good governance, and they naturally have difficulty accepting the trusteeship decision. However, the trusteeship decision seems to be an international agreement: some people in North Korea and some pro-Soviet political groups use the trusteeship decision as a political capital to exclude dissidents. The failure of the Korean situation to be harmonious, the US-Soviet confrontation, and the trusteeship issue are all playing a role. If a unified Korea is to appear, there must first be a tacit understanding of the trusteeship issue, and then US-Soviet coordination can be sought, if coordination is possible. Only under this premise can the Korean situation have a clear hope and possibility.

According to news reports, the Soviet Union's acceptance of the US proposal is based on the understanding that Korean political groups will no longer have expressions and actions of resistance to the trusteeship decision in the future. If what is reported is true, then the Soviet Union's acceptance of the US proposal cannot be completely regarded as the Soviet Union bowing to the United States; on the contrary, the proposal of this understanding is enough to show the Soviet Union's victory. The political groups that are in tune with the Soviet Union have never opposed the trusteeship. On the one hand, the Soviet Union accepts the US proposal, and on the other hand, it takes this opportunity to force Korean political groups not to oppose the trusteeship. This is the Soviet Union's victory. Secondly, reports from the United States believe that the Soviet Union's acceptance of the US proposal indicates that the economic situation in North Korea is deteriorating, and it has no choice but to hope to receive US economic assistance. This is another Soviet victory. The Soviet reply can cause such psychological effects; it can be seen that it has caused considerable effects. What we must point out here is that since the announcement of the Truman Doctrine, the US attitude towards the Soviet Union has become tougher; therefore, the Soviet Union has had to use a new strategy to deal with the United States in some places. Without abandoning its persistent principles, the Soviet Union can adopt a relatively soft policy. This does no harm to itself, and further can gain the sympathy of some people. The Soviet Union seems to have adopted this policy on the Korean issue. What we have to see now is what effect the reconvening of the Joint Commission will have: if there are resolutions, whether these resolutions can be faithfully implemented. This is the biggest test.

There is also one point we must point out here, and that is that the Korean issue was first seen at the Cairo Conference; but the participants in the Cairo Conference were only the United States, China, and Britain. Therefore, China pays special attention to the development of the Korean situation. When the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was held in Moscow in March of this year, our government also revealed its attitude towards the Korean issue, "believing that the establishment and development of the Korean government should not be further delayed." It is in this sense that we welcome Molotov's recent reply to the US government on the Korean issue; undoubtedly, no matter what the effect of the Joint Commission will be in the future, the Soviet move will definitely benefit the establishment and development of the Korean government. We hope that the democratic unification of Korea can be expected from now on; and that in the near future, the Korean people will be able to display their inherent brilliance.

One uses trucks, passing through Xintang on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and Taishan near the Humen Fort to Hong Kong. The other route first goes to Huangpu in the lower reaches of the Pearl River, and then is transported by boat to Hong Kong. These two routes have only been open for a week, and smugglers' profits have increased several times. Many Guangzhou merchants have recently resorted to smuggling exports to evade the customs' new regulations. Importers also find smuggling more convenient, as it avoids the complicated procedures of foreign exchange settlement and customs declaration, and the profits can be even greater. Today, due to the fall in the Hong Kong dollar, the prices of imported goods have also fallen slightly.

### Deteriorating Indonesian-Dutch Relations: Economic Negotiations Break Down; Both Sides Take Extreme Positions, Blaming Each Other for Breach of Contract

[United Press International, Pontianak, Borneo, 11th] The government of the Dutch East Indies issued a statement today, declaring that economic negotiations between the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia have failed, and accusing Indonesia of being uncooperative.

The statement was issued simultaneously in Batavia and Pontianak, claiming that negotiations began after the signing of the agreement recognizing the Republic of Indonesia on March 25th, with the aim of returning raw materials from Java and Sumatra to the world market, controlling imports and exports, establishing a joint Dutch-Indonesian foreign exchange fund, and jointly managing tariffs, so that indigenous goods could be exported immediately. The Indonesian proposal involved all parts of Indonesia, including both the Republic and non-Republic areas, and failed to unconditionally guarantee the return of foreign assets within the Republic to their original owners.

[Reuters, Batavia, 11th] The "New Daily" of the Republic of Indonesia reported that the recent Indonesian cabinet meeting seemed to recognize that conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands was unavoidable, and that since the signing of the Linggadjati Agreement on March 25th, Indonesian-Dutch relations have been in a stalemate, with no progress in either political or economic aspects.

Strong Indonesian Criticism

Indonesian President Sukarno has repeatedly pointed out that the Dutch side has engaged in acts that violate the agreement, such as the establishment of the State of East Indonesia, allowing autonomy in West Borneo, and supporting the establishment of a free state in Pasundan, West Java, all of which are major violations by the Dutch. The "New Daily" stated that the Republic of Indonesia's response will be to adopt an open policy of non-cooperation and implement a severe counter-blockade against the Dutch blockade. According to sources, the "New Daily" has close ties with the Republic's Information Department, and its views can reflect the official Indonesian stance.

West Borneo Autonomy

### US Strengthens Northern Defenses; Air Force Base Built in Alaska; Soviet Outpost in the Arctic Also Resumes Activity

[United Press International, Washington, 12th] The United States, to ensure the security of its northern defense left flank, is building at least one giant bomber base in Alaska, corresponding to a similar base in Maine. This can be seen in the War Department's report today, which states that the Strategic Air Command is building a new runway, large-scale hangars, and other facilities at a base 26 miles southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, at a cost of $8,125,000.

### Kim Gu Organizes Korean Provisional Government; Hodge Issues Statement Deeming it Inappropriate

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 12th] Lieutenant General Hodge, the Military Governor of South Korea, issued an important statement today regarding Kim Gu and others' plans to discuss the organization of a provisional government, stating: Kim Gu and others organized a Korean provisional government in China before the Japanese surrender. When they returned to Korea via Shanghai after the Japanese surrender, they agreed with the United States to return to the country as individuals, not in the name of the provisional government, and to immediately dissolve the provisional government to gain the trust of the United States. The South Korean Military Government also solemnly declared when Kim Gu and others returned to South Korea that no provisional government of any nature would be allowed to be established in South Korea other than the Military Government.

### General Labor Union Congress Resolves to Thoroughly Investigate Impersonators Disrupting Society; Demands Amendment to the Discount on the Indexation Based on the Assessment Committee's Plan; Nine Representatives Presumed to Petition in Beijing

The second session of the General Labor Union Congress was held yesterday at 1:00 p.m. More than 500 representatives from 362 labor unions attended. Director Lu of the Social Affairs Department, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Section Chief Cao of the City Party Headquarters were also present. The meeting began at 2:00 p.m. and elected Zhou Xuexiang, Fan Cai, and Zhang Jindi as the presidium. After the chairman of the union, Shui Xiangyun, and Secretary-General Liang Yongzhang reported on the union's affairs, Director Lu of the Social Affairs Department delivered a speech, followed by Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, who stated: (1) Gratitude to the General Labor Union for assisting the government in handling labor-management disputes, promoting the improvement of workers' lives, and assisting in the implementation of labor policies over the past year. (2) In the past, worker organizations were scattered, but thanks to the efforts of the General Labor Union over the past year, 382 labor unions have joined the General Labor Union, with a total of 450,000 members. This is indeed an achievement of the responsible leadership of the General Labor Union. In the future, it is hoped that all workers in the city will participate in labor unions, and that the organization of each labor union will be very sound. (3) Regarding the de-freezing of the cost-of-living index, when prices fluctuated in late last month and workers' lives were unstable, I paid attention to this at the time. When Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs came to Shanghai, he invited the leaders of labor and management, as well as the city's chamber of commerce and industrial association, to discuss the matter together, and the conclusions were recommended to the government. The current de-freezing measures are a reasonable adjustment made by the government from an overall economic perspective, maintaining the survival of factories on the one hand and guaranteeing the minimum living standards of workers on the other. Finally, Wu added that after this de-freezing, the wage expenditure of general factories increased by 40%, and he hoped that the representatives would inform the workers of each factory to improve work efficiency in order to stabilize the survival of factories. He also reported on the government's relief to unemployed workers in Yangshupu, expressing much sympathy. He emphasized that it is better to be employed than unemployed, and that low wages are better than government relief, and hoped that workers would strive to increase work efficiency. After the representative of the City Party Headquarters delivered a speech, the meeting immediately discussed the agenda. It was resolved that, regarding the discount on the de-freezing of the cost-of-living index, the government should be required to amend it according to the original plan of the Shanghai Labor-Management Assessment Committee (according to the plan of the Labor-Management Assessment Committee, those with a base salary of 30 yuan or less would be paid in full according to the index, and those with a salary of 31 yuan or more and 100 yuan or less would receive a 5% discount for every 10 yuan. The government's approved plan is a 10% discount for every 10 yuan), and representatives Shui Xiangyun, Qiu Changjiang, Gui Fusheng, Feng Yayun, Hu Kun, Dong Rengui, Tang Guifen, Wang Yuxiang, and Xu Zhouliang were sent to Beijing to petition the relevant ministries and commissions. Dong had already left by train last night. A temporary motion was also passed: (1) To send a telegram to the government requesting a thorough crackdown on the Communist Party to stabilize social order and increase production. (2) Recently, various Western newspapers have published reports of impersonators using the name of the General Labor Union to disrupt social order, and the General Labor Union will send personnel to investigate thoroughly.

The employees did not express their agreement because they were too far from what they were asking for. At 8:30 p.m., the employees of both sides each elected five people as the official delegation to negotiate with Deputy Director Jiang again. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 p.m., still without a result. It was decided to continue negotiations this morning.

In the past month, labor strikes, rice riots, and student unrest have occurred one after another in the city. Fortunately, Mayor Wu and Social Bureau Director Wu, and Education Bureau Director Gu, have gone to Nanjing successively to consult with the central government on the issues of unfreezing the cost of living index, the distribution of rice, and the joint entrance examination. Reasonable solutions have been decided upon, which should bring these matters to a conclusion. However, communist elements and their remnants, who are hiding in this city, specialize in disrupting order and inciting unrest. Recently, a secret document of the Communist Party, entitled "Underground Work Struggle Line," was seized. This proves that the arsons that occurred in various places previously and the recent rice robberies and other illegal acts were all instigated or directed by someone. We absolutely cannot tolerate the existence of these disruptive elements who undermine social order.

Imposters Using False Names to Cause Trouble

It was also seen yesterday in the mainland newspapers that someone named Chen Daoqing (transliteration), claiming to represent the Industry and Public Utility Workers' Alliance, openly wrote to the municipal government and the national government, demanding the unconditional unfreezing of the cost of living index and threatening a general strike and the occupation of public utilities to form a local government. According to Mr. Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, the highest-level workers' organization in the city, there is no such organization among the workers in the city, nor is there a person named Chen Daoqing in the labor community. It is clear that imposters are using false names to cause trouble. The government has already decided to reasonably resolve the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index, which can be considered to have met the demands of the workers. Even if there are still points to discuss, opinions should only be expressed legally for the government to consider, and there should be no excessive actions to threaten the government. It is hoped that my fellow workers in Shanghai will thoroughly investigate this illegal act of impersonation. It is especially hoped that the press will refrain from spreading unfounded news intended to incite unrest, so as not to fall into the trap of the troublemakers.

Speaker Pan Speaks on Central Goal

Subsequently, Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, stating that the central goal of today's politics is to seek progress for the nation on a foundation of stability. Regarding the workers' cost of living index, the central government has already decided on a method of unfreezing and adjusting it. In terms of rice, the government has improved distribution and is giving priority to workers in factories, public education personnel, and students in various schools. This is the policy currently adopted by the government to seek stability. While the people of all sectors are concerned about their personal lives, they should still cooperate with the government's policies and work towards social stability. Finally, Chairman Shui Xiangyun of the General Labor Union delivered a speech, and the ceremony concluded around eleven o'clock.

### Principal Sues Two Teachers for Defamation: Case Opens for Trial

Pan Wenzhen, the principal of the National Primary School on Shaanxi North Road, and Chen Suyun and Wu Baoqin, two teachers at the school, previously had a widely publicized fight. Now, Pan Wenzhen has suddenly filed a lawsuit with the District Court against Chen and Wu for defamation. The case was opened for trial yesterday morning in the Second Criminal Division of the District Court by Presiding Judge Wu Xiangzu. The court first questioned the plaintiff, Pan Wenzhen, who testified that the defendant Chen Suyun harbored a grudge against her because she had been suspended. Chen then colluded with Wu Baoqin to distribute a booklet entitled "The Truth About Pan Wenzhen's Assault on Chen Suyun," which contained false accusations of her promiscuous relationships and other matters. "This is completely unfounded and damages my reputation, so I have filed this lawsuit and request legal protection," she said. The court then questioned the defendant, Chen Suyun, who testified that during the Wuding Road fire, she witnessed Pan moving all the fees collected by the school out, but Pan falsely claimed that they were burned and falsely reported to the Education Bureau, intending to re-collect fees from the students. She reported this truthfully to Pan, which led to a conflict and aroused public anger throughout the education community, leading to the organization of the "United Association for the Protection of Teachers' Rights" to support her. This booklet was printed and distributed by the association and has nothing to do with her, she said. The second defendant, Wu Baoqin, gave the same testimony, claiming that the booklet had nothing to do with them and therefore they could not be held responsible. At this time, the defense attorneys for both the plaintiff and the defendants stood up and stated that both sides were from the education community and that their reputations were at stake. Therefore, they requested that the court allow both sides to go outside and try to reconcile first. The court then ordered that the case be adjourned for further review. However, it is learned that Chen Suyun has separately filed a lawsuit with the District Court against Pan Wenzhen for assault. That case will be heard by Judge Meng Tingke on the 19th of this month.

### Reader Consultation: Medical and Health

(1) Bronchitis

Zhao Sufen asks: I am eighteen years old this year and have been physically weak since childhood. I developed bronchitis at the age of five or six and have suffered from it for over ten years. I have been treated by famous doctors both Chinese and foreign, but with no effect. I had an X-ray examination of my lungs, which showed no lung disease. I would like to know: (1) Are there any specialized physicians who treat this disease, and can it be cured completely? (2) How should I take care of myself, and what foods should I avoid? (3) Is it harmful to my health to study at school and read the newspaper every day?

[Answer from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] (1) The Department of Internal Medicine at the Shanghai Municipal Public Hospital and various internal medicine doctors can treat chronic bronchitis. (2) There is no specific cure, but you can inject glucose calcium and calcium iodide, and take multiple vitamin pills and cod liver oil to strengthen your body. Avoid catching colds and prevent various infections by dripping medicine into your nose and frequently gargling with hydrogen peroxide and Listerine mouthwash. When you have asthma, you can use Asmac tablets. Many cases of bronchitis are related to nasal problems, so it is advisable to check the nasal cavity for chronic inflammation. (3) Reading and studying is not a problem.

(2) Prematurely Gray Hair

Fang Ruisen asks: I am twenty-three years old (unmarried) and in good health. Over the years, the hair on the back of my head has turned gray, like silver threads. It is very unsightly. I would like to know: (1) What is this condition? (2) What medicines can treat it?

[Answer from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] Having white hair at the young age of twenty-three suggests possible physical weakness, blood deficiency, or endocrine deficiencies. You should consult a doctor for a detailed physical examination and, if necessary, take or inject blood-tonifying and endocrine-supplementing medications.

### The Meaning of Talent Cultivation: A Lecture Delivered at the Shanghai Municipal Yucai Middle School Weekly Assembly Yesterday

— Lecture by Mr. Pan Gongzhan, recorded by Tang Peixian and Zhou Yunsheng

Fellow students: Today, Principal Yuan asked me to come to your school to say a few words, so I am taking this opportunity to talk about the meaning of the two characters "Yu Cai" (育才, cultivate talent).

Your school has a very long history. It was formerly established by the Municipal Council and taken over by the Municipal Government after the victory. It is hoped that your school will cultivate excellent talents for the locality and the country. Your school's name is also "Yucai." As for how to cultivate and what constitutes talent, that is what I want to talk about today. All of you come to school, from elementary school to middle school, and from middle school to university graduation, all hoping to develop your talents for the country in the future. As for how to develop each person's talents, it depends on the education each person receives at school, especially during this middle school stage. Because middle school is a process in which everyone undergoes the most changes from childhood to adulthood, and it is also the most difficult to grasp. Therefore, education should be given special attention in this stage, and all teachers, parents, and you yourselves should pay special attention.

There are many methods of cultivating talent, which cannot be covered in a short time. Your teachers must have mentioned them at ordinary times. I will now briefly outline them:

Sun Yat-sen once said: "To make China rich, strong, and prosperous, it is necessary to first achieve the four points of making the best use of people's talents, land, things, and smooth flow of goods." According to this statement, let us think further. Among these four points, the first point is the most important. For example, to achieve the point of "making the best use of the land," the most important thing is whether the talent can be properly employed. My country has vast land and abundant resources, which is world-renowned, but if the people of the country do not have knowledge and skills, how can the land be used to its full potential? As for "making the best use of things," first of all, someone must know how to use it. If people do not have talent, then abundant resources are fundamentally useless, because they cannot be used properly. Looking at other countries today, they not only "make the best use of things," but also can use waste materials, but our country cannot even use "available materials." Therefore, during the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: "One person should be used as two, one cent should be used as two, and one thing should be used as two (or even three or four) in order to overcome the difficulties." When it comes to "smooth flow of goods," if there is no talent to develop it, transportation will be inconvenient, and coupled with sabotage everywhere, how can transportation be convenient? How can goods flow smoothly? In short, the most important thing is to make the best use of talent.

Sun Yat-sen, in his letter to Li Hongzhang in the late Qing Dynasty, mentioned three steps regarding "cultivating talent": (1) teaching and nurturing with proper methods, (2) encouraging with appropriate methods, and (3) employing with effective methods. These three steps should be carried out simultaneously so that everyone in a country has talent and can be used. Although talents vary in size, they should be used to their full potential. I will now talk about the first step: If students do not receive a good education at school, then many talents will be buried in school, harming our country and our society. Therefore, students should all have the belief of "self-respect" and "self-awareness." I most disagree with people saying: "There is no talent now (or in a certain era)." This is absolutely unacceptable. I believe that there are talents everywhere at any time. We just need to discover them, cultivate them, and use them. For example, in Chinese history, during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang (Li Shimin), there were many talented people in the court. But we should know that these talents were not created by the Tang Dynasty. They were all former officials of the Sui Dynasty. Why didn't they build the Sui Dynasty into a strong and prosperous one during the Sui Dynasty? Why could they demonstrate their talents in the Tang Dynasty? This is because the Sui Dynasty did not make good use of talent. Therefore, as long as a person has talent, they will not be buried forever. One day they will stand out and show themselves. As long as they are employed effectively, there will be "talents" at any time and anywhere. Sun Yat-sen also said: "Talents vary in intelligence, and without learning, it is impossible to distinguish their talents; talents have completeness and partiality, and without learning, it is impossible to develop their use." A person's natural endowment has intelligence and foolishness, but without "cultivation," their talents cannot be developed. The size of "talent" is irrelevant, but whether it can be used well is. "Talent" is divided into "all-round talent" and "specialized talent." "All-round talent" is broad talent. "Specialized talent" is research focused on one area. Or to say that "all-round talent" is "generalist", "specialized talent" is "expert", "generalist" and "expert" each have their uses. But a "generalist" cannot be used as an "expert", and an "expert" cannot be used as a "generalist". For example, if a student has the talent to study "mathematics," but his parents insist that he study "literature," then the employment is not effective. The "misguided teaching that buries talent" that I mentioned earlier is also based on this point.

A student's achievement depends on the teacher for a small part, and on themselves for a large part. In addition to their own efforts, they should also have good teachers and helpful friends. In this excellent environment, if you can constantly strive for self-improvement, you will all be talents in the future. Talents may be big or small, but as long as I dedicate my "talents" to the public, society, and country as much as possible, I will have fulfilled my responsibility. Therefore, every student must not have the thought of "self-abandonment," and must not think that their talents are small and their aptitude is foolish, and "willingly degenerate." Otherwise, even if there are good teachers to teach and parents to cultivate, it will be useless.

Finally, what I want to tell you is that in addition to learning all the knowledge and skills in books, we students should also pay attention to the cultivation of morality, and how to be a person in the world. In other words, we cannot leave "virtue" and only talk about "talent." If we only have "talent" and no "virtue," then it is the same as having no "talent." Therefore, if we have "talent," we must also have "virtue." Therefore, a person must see if he has "virtue" to achieve his "talent." The ancients said: "Achieve virtue and attain talent." If "achieving virtue" and "attaining talent" are combined, it becomes "cultivating talent." You will all have opportunities to develop your "talents" in the future. I hope you will work hard to learn and advance in both "virtue" and "talent" to complete great talents. (Due to time constraints, this article has not been submitted to Mr. Pan Gongzhan for revision.

### Tight Money Supply · Labor Unrest Threat · Chinese Stocks Plunge Across the Board Yesterday · Wing On Textiles Falls to Limit and Approaches Today's Limit

Yesterday, Chinese stocks plunged across the board due to a tight money supply and the renewed threat of strikes. Mid-session, the slight rebound due to the Shanghai Electric Power Company's rally was ultimately negated. Wing On Textiles plummeted to the daily limit and approached today's limit.

At the opening, the market opened much lower due to news of extremely tight liquidity in the financial sector over the weekend, with major banknotes also being suspended from issuance. Subsequently, Wing On Textiles opened at $5250 and presented excessive supply, with #152, #85, #91, #183, #22, #4, #197, #163, #224 all selling aggressively, causing it to fall to the daily limit. Then, American Asia was quoted down to the limit by #65, #140, #25, Wing On Textiles by #140, and Matches by #223 and #91. Da Tong, Wing On Public, China Textiles, Tongyi, China Silk, and Jingfu all plummeted to their limits, and Wing On Textiles was further pushed down to within $5000. At 10:20 AM, #65, #76, #141, and #171 took deliveries, and Wing On Textiles rose to $5130. #159 and #183 continued to sell, resulting in another drop. #47, #160, #223, and #76 continued to settle positions, briefly pushing the price down to a low of $4960. Later, due to repeated reports of rising prices for Hong Kong Electric Power, buying interest began to pick up at 11:20 AM, with #54, #228, #143, #89, #232, #171, and #186 buying again, and the price rose to $5180 near noon. #129, #160, and #154 added to the settling, and the midday closing price retreated to around $5100.

After the close, bid prices were low then high, and finally around $5150. Compared to last Saturday, American Asia fell to the limit, Wing On Textiles rebounded slightly after hitting the limit, down nearly 10%, Sin Wah fell more than 10%, New Kwong was only slightly down due to independent support from #204, as was Jingfu, Chun Hing fell more than half a percent, New China fell slightly less than 10%, and Wing On Public also fell 10%. For immediate delivery, American Asia fell to the limit, and Wing On Textiles rebounded after hitting the limit, down less than 10%. The same was true for Sin Wah, Wing On Public and Chun Hing fell by half a percent, and New Kwong and Jingfu fell slightly. Among the unpopular stocks, Da Tong, Matches, and China Silk rebounded after falling to the limit, each down about 10%. New Chiyu and Commerce fell more than half a percent, and Cement fell 10%. King Lun fell slightly.

In the afternoon, the money supply became even tighter, and #207 was the first to sell aggressively, with Wing On Textiles opening at the limit for immediate delivery. #129 also sold, and Wing On Textiles fell to $4850. At this time, American Asia, Matches, Wing On Public, Da Tong, China Textiles, and China Silk all fell to the limit. #143 and #152 moved lower to buy in, raising the price to $4950. Commerce, Tongyi, and Sin Wah also fell to the limit. #224, #77, #99, #16, #154, and #207 sold again, breaking $4800. New Asia and Wing Salt also hit the limit, and New Kwong, Jingfu, and Chun Hing were also forced to the limit. #235, #14, and #160 sold off, and Wing On Textiles fell to within $4650. Near the close, the price struggled around $4670. After the close, #4 and others continued to sell, resulting in further declines. The sudden severity of labor unrest made people nervous. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wing On Textiles, Wing On Public, American Asia, and Sin Wah fell to the limit, and New China, New Kwong, Jingfu, and Chun Hing fell less than half a percent. For immediate delivery, Wing On Textiles, Sin Wah, American Asia, and Wing On Public fell to the limit. New Kwong, Jingfu, and Chun Hing fell slightly less than half a percent. Among the unpopular stocks, Wing Fung, China Textiles, Tongyi, Da Tong, China Silk, Matches, New Asia, and Commerce fell to their limits, and King Lun and Cement fell slightly less than half a percent. Outside the exchange, all stocks plunged, with supply exceeding demand. For Wing On Textiles arbitrage, #47 of Farmers paid $120 in the afternoon, but only about 27 cents. It is heard that interest rates for inter-dealer transactions outside the market were as high as 50 cents or more.

### Foreign Stocks Decline Across the Board

Yesterday, foreign stocks saw Yi-Zhing up to 19 outside on the Hong Kong-Shanghai power surge. Jardine Matheson fell to $59,000 on the spot, brokers and money exchangers added to the selling. Although there was a slight rebound mid-session due to the Shanghai Electric Power Company's rally, it still fell again following the overall trend in the afternoon. The low price reached $51,500 before stabilizing slightly. Guangzhou brokers and foreign firms absorbed some stock. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yi-Zhing, Union Insurance, Navigation, and Steel all fell by 25%, Yee Guang, KenTing, and Kaiping each fell by 20%, and the remaining stocks fell by 10% to 15%.

### Government Bonds Weaken

Government bonds also weakened yesterday due to the impact of the tight money supply. United Series C opened at $14,200, the high price was $14,500, rooms 360 and 503 sold, and gradually fell to $11,200. At noon, it hovered outside $12,000. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Series A and B fell by $1,500, Series C fell by $2,400, Series D fell by $1,700, and Series E fell by $1,400. Trading volume was approximately $5.6 million.

### Representatives of Gold Shops from Various Regions to Petition in the Capital on a Set Date

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the emergence of black market prices for gold, the business of gold shops across the country has virtually come to a standstill, and they all feel unable to maintain huge expenditures. It is now heard that representatives of gold shops from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will gather in Nanjing before the 15th of this month to petition relevant agencies such as the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Senate, with the main requests being: (1) asking the government to allocate raw materials, and (2) if raw materials cannot be allocated, then asking to restore the free trading system of the industry. If these requests still cannot be fulfilled, then gold shops across the country will decide to shut down completely at the end of this month. Regarding the gold shop industry in this city, Wu Pengnian, Yao Guiqing, Chen Dezhang, and Qiu Yungen have been designated to participate in the petition. It is heard that Mr. Wu and his party are scheduled to go to the capital by early train today.

### Textile Control Commission Approves Two Important Cases: Cotton Yarn Spun from Last Year's Stockpile Will No Longer Be Purchased at Half the Quantity; New Agreed Price for 20-Count Standard Yarn Set at $5.4 Million Per Piece

[Report from Our Newspaper] The 33rd regular meeting of the Textile Control Commission was held at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM. Wu (concurrently Chairman), Li (Vice-Chairman), and Commissioners Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, and Tang Xinghai, as well as Liu Wenteng and Wang Zijian from the commission, attended. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM after passing two important resolutions, which are summarized as follows:

(1) Regarding cotton yarn spun from cotton stockpiled at the end of last December, various yarn mills believe that the current depreciation of currency and the sharp rise in cotton prices mean that the purchase price set by the government is insufficient to cover the cost of reproduction. Moreover, the more cotton stockpiled by each yarn mill, the less foreign cotton they can be allocated. Furthermore, the government's purchase of cotton yarn spun from cotton stockpiled at the end of last December is limited to yarn mills in the Shanghai area, which seems unfair. After Wu (concurrently Chairman) submitted it to the National Price Committee for discussion, it was approved that, starting from April of this year, this cotton yarn will be exempt from being purchased at half the quantity. However, this does not apply to cotton yarn spun from cotton allocated by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and foreign cotton. It was presented to the meeting yesterday and approved for implementation. (2) The new agreed price for cotton yarn has also been approved by the National Price Committee. The price is set at $5.4 million per piece, based on 20-count standard yarn, and will be implemented starting today. However, the purchase price for 20-count yarn will temporarily remain at the old price of $4.6 million per piece. (The cotton cost used for the new agreed price is calculated based on $750,000 for Relief and Rehabilitation Administration cotton and $1.8 million for the market price of cotton. However, the percentage used for calculation is slightly different from that calculated by private yarn mills.) It was also presented and approved for implementation yesterday.

[Another Report] The methods for reviewing and approving applications for transshipment of yarn and cloth were drafted by the commission and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. It is now reported that the ministry has issued instructions to the commission and is expected to announce them today.

[Another Report] The registration matters for the commission's handling of yarn and cloth for applications to various ports in Hebei and Northeast China expired yesterday. A total of 667 manufacturers have obtained registration forms. However, yesterday, manufacturers flocked to obtain and submit forms, so the commission has specially extended the deadline for submitting forms to the end of today. After this, the review process will begin, and it is expected to be completed in about a week.

### Measures to Prevent the Resale of "Purchase Permits" for Textile Construction

Recently, amid price fluctuations, the market price of yarn and cloth has risen sharply, significantly exceeding the allocation price set by the authorities. Obtaining an allocation of yarn and cloth can generate more than double the profit in the blink of an eye. It has recently been discovered that some manufacturers are directly transferring and selling the "purchase permits" allocated by the Textile Construction Corporation in order to seek huge profits. This behavior violates the authorities' intention of allocation. It is now learned that, in order to prevent the resale of "purchase permits," the China Textile Public Company has specially stipulated four measures to add seals for prevention, starting yesterday (the 12th): (1) Each customer must affix the same seal on the purchase permit when submitting the purchase request form every morning. Omissions will be rejected and invalidated. (2) The endorsement of bank cashier's checks used to pay for the goods must bear the same seal. (3) The back of the warehouse receipt must also bear the same seal. (4) If the seals on the purchase permit, payment check, and warehouse receipt do not match, the payment or delivery will be refused, and the allocation will be suspended. Starting yesterday, the purchase request forms used by manufacturers have been replaced with new forms by the company, and the old forms are invalid. Seals are affixed in accordance with the announced measures for affixing seals. It is expected that the evil practice of reselling "purchase permits" will gradually disappear.

### Import Control Commission Simplifies Extension Matters for Letters of Credit and Import Licenses

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank yesterday issued Circular No. 98 to various designated banks, stating in brief: In order to simplify the extension matters for letters of credit and import licenses, the Executive Committee of the Import Control Commission has approved the following measures:

1.  For letters of credit opened after November 17, 1946, designated banks may extend them based on the import validity period stated on the import license. The designated banks shall report these extensions to the Central Bank and the relevant departments of the Import Control Commission that approved the extension on a weekly basis.

2.  The extension of import licenses still requires review by the Import Control Commission. Applicants should directly send a letter to the commission to handle the relevant parts of the approved foreign exchange application form.

3.  For letters of credit opened before November 17, 1946, and for which all foreign exchange has been settled with the designated bank, and the extension application is submitted within one month after the expiration of the letter of credit, the extension matters shall be handled by the Non-Quota Import Review Office. The extension period for letters of credit opened before November 17, 1946, shall not be later than June 30 of this year.

The relevant sections mentioned in the bank's Circular No. 97 shall be abolished.

### Social Affairs Bureau Stops Market Sales of Rice; Measures for Allocating Rice Decided; Targeting Teachers, Factory Workers, and the Poor

Regarding the city's food problem, Mayor Wu stated yesterday that public officials and teachers, as well as boarding students from various schools, will be directly allocated rice by the Municipal Government. The poor will be allocated rice by weight at distribution points established by the government. He also stated that the detailed measures are still being discussed by Wu (Director of the Social Affairs Bureau) in Nanjing, and will be prepared and implemented after his return to Shanghai.

It is now learned that Director Wu returned to Shanghai by overnight train the day before yesterday. Reporters visited him yesterday and were informed that the rice allocation measures have been roughly agreed upon, and the implementation procedures are still being discussed and decided. In the future, (1) boarding students of national universities, teachers and boarding students of private universities, (2) boarding students of municipal middle schools, teachers and boarding students of private middle schools, (3) teachers of private elementary schools, and (4) factory workers will all be allocated rice at a limit of two dou (pecks) per person per month. Each school and factory will first submit a roster to the bureau for verification, and allocation will be carried out immediately. However, private schools are limited to those that have been registered, and factories are limited to those that have been registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and have a ministry certificate or a receipt from the Social Affairs Bureau.

Regarding the poor, measures will be modeled after the discounted rice sales. First, each district office will discuss and decide on the measures, starting with an investigation. After the rosters are complete, allocation will be carried out by district, and flour may be bundled for sale in the future to make adjustments. All implementation measures are currently under discussion. Implementation will begin after an agreement is reached with relevant agencies.

Reporters also inquired about the standards for the poor and the allocation quantity. Mr. Wu said that the standards for the poor will start with slum dwellers, and the allocation quantity has been slightly changed. After consultation with the Ministry of Food, one dou (peck) per month will be allocated per person, and five sheng (pints) for young children. As for the addresses of the district public sales offices, they will be set up at the original locations where the Social Affairs Bureau sold discounted flour last year, with merchants commissioned to handle the sales and a handling fee subsidized to the commissioned merchants. The district offices will issue rice purchase certificates for the rice allocation measures, and people can purchase rice at the public sales offices with the certificates. Regarding the roster format for schools and factories applying for rice allocation, Mr. Wu said that the Social Affairs Bureau will announce a unified format soon, and the content will be very simple, only requiring the name, origin, position, identification number, and address. Furthermore, the Social Affairs Bureau has stopped selling 9,000 bags of rice to the market daily, starting yesterday.

### Silk Market Conditions Weaken

The allocation of rayon is imminent. Although it is rumored that the selling price will increase to $9.8 million, there is still a huge difference compared to the black market. Therefore, in yesterday's market, #120 Kosan Arai was weak at the opening. In the morning, it hovered between $16.2 million and $16.3 million, and closed at $6.2 million. In the afternoon, market sentiment was even more fragile, and peers retreated to $5.8 million due to tight liquidity, a significant drop of $1.5 million compared to last weekend. Due to the shortage of goods, #75 Semi-Gloss was only down by $1 million.

Factory silk was also weak in yesterday's market. Deals were only made for C-grade products at $18.5 million with a 7-day bill, and high-grade products were priced separately at $17.6 million, both down by $500,000 compared to last weekend. There were no other transactions, only bid prices.

Silk fabric transactions were quiet. The bid prices for quilt covers remained unchanged in the morning, but there were no transactions. Checked crepe was traded at $29,600. Reports from the Shengze production area were lower, with the price of pure electric plain weave greige fabric at $250,000, so the price in Shanghai yesterday was also $30,000 lower.

### Restrictions on Foreign Goods Entering Hong Kong; Exceptions Made for Goods Benefiting Hong Kong's Recovery

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 12th] Following the government's recent revision of the method for allocating US and Philippine currency, trade between Hong Kong and the US, Canada, the Philippines, and other US dollar bloc countries is set to face further setbacks. The Hong Kong government has also indirectly informed importers that applications for importing non-essential goods will not be accepted. The quantity of US, Philippine, and Canadian foreign exchange that the Hong Kong government plans to allocate between June 21st and December 12th, 1947, is approximately the same as during the same period last year. The Hong Kong government will notify applicant importers in advance of the amount of foreign exchange they can expect to receive, so they can arrange orders accordingly. When applying for foreign exchange, importers must report to the supply department the quantity of imported goods, the amount of US dollars required, the quantity and value of such goods imported in any pre-war year, and a list of established US or Canadian agents. If the importing firm is newly established in Hong Kong after the war, they must also state the date of registration, the amount of capital, and the list of agents. Upon careful examination, the list of imported goods eligible for US dollar allocation excludes purely luxury items, such as nylon stockings and fountain pens. The government has indicated its hope to increase the number of items listed, to include certain other goods needed by Hong Kong itself. However, it has also stated that importers should refrain from applying if they cannot provide strong reasons for needing to import such goods. The list of imported goods eligible for US dollar allocation is divided into two categories, based on their effectiveness in revitalizing Hong Kong. Category A: Building materials, timber, sanitary equipment, mechanical engines, machine tools, tinplate, electric wires, steel, steel pipes, auto parts, tires, (new) refrigeration equipment, electric fans, mineral oil, wax and petroleum products, vegetable oil and fats, woolen yarn and rubber, office machinery and equipment, typewriters, calculators, cash registers, filing cabinets, pigments and dyes, industrial and manufactured chemicals, manufactured tobacco leaves, pharmaceuticals and toiletries, razor blades, paper, ink, books and magazines, photographic film, motion pictures and rented motion pictures, piece goods, manufactured clothing, various vegetable oils, grains, fresh fruit, canned fruit, and dried goods. Category B: Cars and trucks, radios, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, watches, coffee, beverages (beer).

Although the government's new system restricts the types of imported goods eligible for US dollar allocation, some merchants believe this is a necessary measure given the shortage of US dollars. The shortage of US dollars is partly due to exporters' unwillingness to sell US dollars to the government, instead trading them on the black market. Although the export of US currency or New York drafts is prohibited, there are still many loopholes. For example, although US currency or drafts cannot be exported via postal delivery, the government has no authority to inspect mail. Therefore, private remittances are difficult to prevent. Observers predict that after the implementation of the new measures, the demand for US dollars will decrease, while the market prices of luxury goods will likely increase.

### Adjustment of Flour Rationing Price

Flour Price at 78,000 Yuan

Various flour mills in the city have stated that the current flour rationing price is far below cost, making it difficult to avoid losses, and have requested an adjustment to the rationing price. Flour merchants have also requested an adjustment to their profit margins, due to the rising costs of various expenses. It is understood that the rationing price and sales price of flour have been approved by Mayor Wu, and are generally as follows:

(1) 50-pound bag of foreign flour: rationing price of 75,500 yuan, profit of 4,000 yuan, transportation fee of 800 yuan, sales price of 80,300 yuan. (2) 70-pound bag of foreign flour: rationing price of 105,700 yuan, profit of 6,000 yuan, transportation fee of 1,200 yuan, sales price of 112,900 yuan. (3) 100-pound bag of foreign flour: rationing price of 151,000 yuan, profit of 8,000 yuan, transportation fee of 1,600 yuan, sales price of 160,600 yuan. (4) Bag of local flour: rationing price of 72,000 yuan, profit of 4,000 yuan, transportation fee of 780 yuan, factory tax of 1,000 yuan, stamp tax of 220 yuan, sales price of 78,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Remains Quiet

Yesterday's tea market for foreign firms: the process remained lackluster, with green tea buyers taking a wait-and-see approach, and sentiment remaining weak. As for various types of domestically sold tea, the amount entering and leaving the market was still similar, and the market remained stable. It is understood that new tea from various producing areas is being actively produced, but ultimately, the prices are surprisingly high, with few seekers, and the market is unusually quiet. It is also understood that pearl jasmine tea and Anhui baked green tea are being accepted by Tianjin merchants regardless of price, but the market supply is thin, making it difficult to fulfill demand. The market price remains stable.

### Upholding the Goal of Supporting Industry and Commerce: Lending Rates Will Not Be Increased

In order to strengthen cooperation and connections with commercial banks and businesses, assist production enterprises, and encourage the circulation of daily necessities and export goods, the Central Bank has established a Discount and Lending Committee to handle applications from commercial banks and businesses for rediscounting, re-pledging, and re-discounting export bills. The discount and lending measures are being actively promoted. Many commercial banks and businesses believe that the interest rates set by the national bank are too low to cover expenses, and hope for an increase. According to a responsible person at the national bank: the discount and lending measures are intended to support production enterprises and the export of goods, to reduce the burden on manufacturers and exporters, and to achieve the goal of reducing costs, so it is necessary to provide low-interest loans. If the interest rate were to be increased, the original intention would be lost, and the burden on manufacturers and exporters would be increased, leading to renewed oppression by high-interest loans. There is no reason to increase the interest rate. Furthermore, commercial banks and businesses themselves only provide 20% of the loan amount, while the interest on rediscounting, re-pledging, and re-discounting export bills is calculated at half the original interest rate. The interest earned is already considerable, and should be sufficient to cover the expenses of each bank and business. Regarding the cumbersome application procedures, the responsible person said that efforts are being made to improve the procedures if they are beneficial to borrowers. After the application is submitted, a meeting is held to review and approve the loan. In view of China's circumstances, this is already extremely convenient.

### Police Bureau's Economic Division Investigates the Account Books of Five Sugar Merchants; Taiwan Sugar Corporation Official Discusses Sugar Rationing

[Report from this newspaper] The Police Bureau's Economic Division recently received a report stating that certain sugar merchants have connections with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, resulting in a larger allocation of sugar each period compared to ordinary sugar merchants, and that some of the sugar is suspected of being resold on the black market. The bureau, together with personnel from the municipal government's Investigation Office, dispatched investigators and first reviewed the account books of five companies with the largest allocation quantities each time: Yonghe (No. 1, Xingye Lane, Sichuan South Road), Mao Taiheng (No. 4, China General Chamber of Commerce Building, Shiliupu), Qianyi (No. 172, Julu Road), Zhongyi (No. 19, Fengjing Road), and Zhongxing (No. A5, Xinyongan Street). It is reported that Yonghe's allocation quantity each time is 810 bags, and the others are slightly reduced from this amount.

Another report: A responsible person from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation yesterday gave a statement to reporters regarding the actual situation of sugar rationing by the company this year: He stated that the company has distributed sugar for a total of fourteen periods since January of this year. Starting from the fifth period, financial fluctuations and soaring prices led to fluctuations in the sugar market, and the application quantity for one period reached 138,000 bags. The price of sugar fluctuated again in the eighth period, so the average allocation quantity from the fifth, sixth, and seventh periods was used as the basis for rationing. The ninth to thirteenth periods were rationed according to the eighth period's method.

The fourteenth period, which has recently resumed rationing, saw a total application quantity from sugar merchants of 175,000 bags, breaking the record for past application quantities. The large amount made it impossible for the company to ration according to the applications. Therefore, the allocation quantity for the first to thirteenth periods was added to the application quantity for the fourteenth period, and then divided by fourteen, with sugar merchants being allocated according to the resulting average. The highest allocation quantity in this period was 500 bags. Even if the merchant's average allocation quantity exceeded 500 bags, they could only be allocated 500 bags, to show restriction. The company has detailed records of the quantity of sugar distributed each time, and the sugar merchants who received the allocations.

### Sugar Prices Soften

Yesterday's sugar market saw prices soften as rationed goods could be released today, and credit was tight. Peruvian fine granulated sugar initially sold for 425,000 yuan, then 418,000 yuan, a decrease of over 20,000 yuan. 24 coarse white sugar sold for 450,000 yuan, a decrease of 230,000 yuan. 20 medium granulated sugar sold for 420,000 yuan, a small decrease of 15,000 yuan. Shantou green sugar sold for 275,000 yuan, a small decrease of 5,000 yuan. Shunde green sugar sold for 265,000 yuan, unchanged. Chaozhou green sugar was quoted at the original price, but no transactions occurred. Xinghua white sugar sold for 400,500 yuan to 405,000 yuan, a small decrease of 10,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar sold for 300,000 yuan to 310,000 yuan, unchanged.

### Rebuilding the Canal Dyke in Northern Jiangsu

— Zhenjiang, 7th (Express Dispatch) This Newspaper Reporter He Xianglin

In Northern Jiangsu, on this vast plain, to this day, no one believes that it remains so complex. In every corner, there still lurk many disasters and hardships, poverty, displacement, and a desolate scene of abandoned fields. Especially recently, after the fierce destruction and intrusions by the Communist Party.

To coordinate with this work, the Su-Ning Sub-District has allocated 9,100 tons of flour and 3.4 billion in cash allocated by the central government, using a work-relief approach to repair the canal project in Northern Jiangsu. This is the lifeline of the people of Northern Jiangsu, the hope for the lives and property of eight million people.

Currently, one-third of the work to repair the riverbanks and restore the dikes of the Jiangbei Canal and Yi-Jiu River has been completed. The sub-district specially invited a group of reporters from Zhenjiang and Shanghai to visit.

Lifeline for Eight Million People

On May 1st, we boarded a special boat into the Guazhou entrance. Stone embankment walls were visible on both sides. However, this is a secondary project. Nevertheless, a total of 16,000 cubic meters of stone have been used to repair the 18 li section from Guazhou to Yangzi Bridge on both sides. At the culvert entrances, water-lifting vehicles were already pumping water.

The most important project on the Liji River is from Shaobo to Huaiyin. Due to the rain and wet roads, we could not proceed, so we stopped in Yangzhou. Before conducting an on-site inspection, the river engineering authorities provided a general report on the condition of the canal and the entire project.

The only natural disaster in Northern Jiangsu is the breaching of the canal. Its cause is due to the changes in the Yellow River. Historically, the Yellow River has changed its course six times. In 1495 AD, the Yellow River breached in Wuyang and other counties, diverted through Xuzhou, and entered the sea via the Huai River and the canal. This was the fifth major diversion. By the sixth major diversion, in the fifth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, the river breached at Tongwaxiang, diverted into the Bohai Sea through the Daqing River. As a result, the former course was silted up by the sediment carried by the river, causing the entrance of the Huai River into the sea to be submerged. Therefore, the entire Huai River flows into Hongze Lake, and then is discharged into the canal through Baoying, Gaoyou, Shaobo, and other lakes, and then enters the Yangtze River. However, the lake water is higher than the canal. Therefore, it depends on the barriers on the east and west banks. If the dikes are not carefully maintained during the autumn floods, they will collapse. At the same time, the maximum total flow from Hongze Lake is 15,000 cubic meters per second, while the maximum total flow of the dams entering the Yangtze River is 8,333 cubic meters per second, and the maximum total flow of the old sea dams is 4,633 cubic meters per second, totaling only slightly more than 80% of the outflow from Hongze Lake. Therefore, the problem with the canal lies in the Huai River. The fundamental solution lies in diverting the Huai River. However, the project to divert the Huai River is quite arduous, and it is difficult to determine when it can be completed. Therefore, the dikes on both sides of the canal remain the lifeline for the lives and property of eight million people.

The canal within the province, from Huanglinzhuang on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong to Yangzhuang in Huaiyin County, is the Middle Canal, with a length of 344 li. From south of Huaiyin County to Guazhou in Jiangdu County, it is 340 li long and is the Inner Canal. The Middle Canal is harmed by the Yishu River water flowing south from Shandong Province. The Inner Canal is harmed by the Huai River flowing west from Henan and Anhui provinces. When the Yishu River and other rivers swell, the Middle Canal's dikes will overflow and breach, causing disaster in Shao County, Suqian, Siyang, Shuyang, Lianshui, Guanyun, and Donghai counties. If the dikes of the Inner Canal are not maintained during the swelling of the Huai River, then Huaian, Baoying, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, Taixian, and Funing counties will be submerged, and the obstruction of the downstream flow of the Yishu River will cause Xu Hai and other counties to also suffer from submersion. The tragedy of the great flood in Jiangbei in 1931 saw 26 major breaches in the east and west dikes of the canal between Gaoyou County and Shaobo Town in Jiangdu County, over a length of 60 li. The water poured down like the Milky Way, pooling in Xinghua, Gaoyou, Dongtai, Taixian, Baoying, Jiangdu, Yancheng, Huaian, Funing, and other counties east of the canal, covering an area of 50,000 square li. The water depth was over a zhang (about 10 feet) in the deep areas and 6-7 chi (about 6-7 feet) in the shallow areas. The number of deaths was about 10,000, and the loss of property was over 200 million yuan in the currency of the time. Statistics show that there were 212 large and small breaches in the Middle and Inner Canals, with a total width of 5,632.7 zhang. The cost of repairing the dikes after the disaster was over 3 million yuan, and the value of the flour for the work-relief portion was not included, nor was the number of breaches and the cost of repairing the Yishu River included. It can be said that this was a comprehensive catastrophe in Jiangbei after the Yellow River moved north.

When the War of Resistance Against Japan began in 1937, the Huai River flooded every year, but fortunately, it did not cause a major disaster. However, the Yishu River tail-end area was always at risk of disaster, because the dikes were not strong. Every time the flood season came, the upstream water would cause floods. Especially last summer, there were over 50 breaches of varying sizes, and tens of millions of mu of farmland were submerged. The central government and the Jiangsu provincial government immediately began to work on the canal's dike restoration project. However, the area above Shaobo was still occupied by the Chinese Communist Party. Although representatives from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and relevant water conservancy agencies and local gentry, braved the dangers and repeatedly negotiated with the CCP regarding the method for carrying out the dike restoration project, they failed to reach a result due to deep-seated prejudices. It was not until the National Army advanced north and recovered Gaobao and Huai in October that the canal dike restoration project began, planned, and implemented. The Executive Yuan's Water Conservancy Commission distributed the flour allocated by the UNRRA, and it was handed over to the Jiangsu Provincial Government after consultation with the Huai River Diversion Committee to establish the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, and the central government approved and allocated funds in stages. However, during the initial period of military stabilization, local order had not been fully restored, and the progress of the project was not easy. After much planning and overcoming obstacles, the canal dike officially started construction on January 30th of this year, and the Yishu River dike project began on March 24th of this year. It is estimated that from the start of construction to the end of April of this year, the average daily workforce was about 25,000 people, completing over 1.11 million cubic meters of earthwork. During this work, CCP elements often created rumors between Baoying and Huaiyin, attempting to obstruct the project, and even threatened laborers, preventing them from going to work. If the response was slightly inappropriate, not only would the workforce easily disperse, but the personnel involved in the work would also face unexpected disasters at any time. In February of this year, Zhang Xueli, the bao chief of the first bao in Dachi Township, Nanpingqiao Town, Huaian County, and Liu Xuebao, the household chief, were shot and killed by the CCP army for persuading laborers to work. However, this is their lifeline, how can they not work? In addition, the troops stationed mostly in towns and villages. In the countryside, the remnants of the CCP army would appear at night. The personnel stationed at the construction sites did not dare to sleep peacefully at night. Every time there was an alert, they would flee several times a night. We do not care about any party or any ideology, to win over the people, we must stabilize the people. The common people hate such worthless destruction and harassment.

The situation along the canal above Huaiyin is even worse. Taking the transportation of work supplies as an example, if it is not transported by car, there is a risk of being robbed. The work supplies in the Yishu River area are currently being transported from Xuzhou via the eastern section of the Longhai Railway to the nearby stations. However, due to transportation difficulties, only 600 bags have reached the destination. Therefore, it is not easy to coordinate the work and proceed.

In summary, the Northern Jiangsu Canal project is supplied with materials by the sub-district, cash by the central government, and managed by the Huai River Diversion Committee's Canal Dyke Restoration Engineering Bureau. The former is responsible for repairing ship locks and culverts, and the latter is responsible for restoring the dikes. There are three main goals: flood control, navigation and irrigation, and water discharge. Currently, only the first item has been achieved and is about to be completed. The entire project requires 3,706,125 cubic meters of earthwork and 37,044 cubic meters of stonework. The approved amount of work supplies is 8,800 tons, and the work funds are over 2.1 billion yuan. The earthwork that has been completed is 800,000 cubic meters in the section of the Jiangbei Canal from Huaiyin to Shaobo, 150,000 cubic meters from Huaiyin to Huanglinzhuang, and 150,000 cubic meters in the Yishu River area. About 13,000 cubic meters of stone have been mined, and 5,800 cubic meters have been transported to the construction site. Construction has now begun at Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Baoying, and is expected to be completed by the end of June of this year.

The reporter group arrived in Yangzhou on May 2nd. We originally planned to rush to Shaobo in the afternoon, but the weather did not cooperate. The rain continued. At 7:00 a.m. the next morning, before having breakfast, we set off and traveled by car to Shaobo. On both sides of the highway, the fields were flat, and the wheat had already ripened. However, the natural disasters and man-made disasters over the years have left the beautiful land full of wounds. After about an hour, we arrived in Shaobo Town. After a quick breakfast, we went to the dam.

Shaobo Lock — A Battlefield of Lament

We first went to the ship lock to see that it has now completely lost its effectiveness. It was also a victim of the CCP's unrest. Currently, ships need to change course and use a breach in the west dike upstream of the ship lock, temporarily using the lake surface as a waterway. The original building of the management office was completely destroyed by bombing, leaving only remnants. Other houses were also demolished, leaving only tiles and trenches crisscrossing, a sad sight. The remaining pillboxes are overgrown with weeds. The left gate upstream was hit by artillery shells, and the gear housing of the opening and closing mechanism of the small door on the left was also broken, and the spindle was bent and could not be used. The rocking car box had many bullet holes, and the gate could not be opened. The iron cover on the left bank upstream was damaged by hand grenades, and the traces remain. The above-water portion of the lock body is generally intact, only the concrete cover has a shell hole in the middle. Near the axis of the left-hand gate downstream, the reinforcing steel is exposed and the protective wood is completely damaged, also hit by artillery shells. In particular, the drawbridge has not been used for a long time and is now difficult to move. The character "lock" in the inscription "Shaobo Ship Lock" under the bridge was also damaged by artillery shells. This ship lock was completed in 1936, at a cost of over 700,000 yuan. It is 10 meters wide and 100 meters long, with a navigation depth of 2.5 meters, enough to accommodate one large ship of 900 tons or ten ships of 40 tons at a time. The maximum water level difference between upstream and downstream is 7.7 meters. The gate is made of steel, and the walls are made of reinforced concrete. The sides of the lock chamber are sloped with stone blocks, and the bottom of the lock is also paved with stone blocks. Such a great project was destroyed.

The broken car on the right gate was re-equipped during the enemy-puppet period, and the two small houses next to the gate were also built by the enemy-puppet regime, and some remnants still exist. This also seems to be a satire on reality. We visited this damaged ship lock, and we also saw the new battlefield where innocent people were killed. The only thought is that the Communist Party has let down the innocent people too much.

Active Projects Awaiting Development

The canal lock project started in 1933 and, by the winter of 1936, the navigation projects that had been completed included four ship locks: Shaobo Ship Lock, Gaoyou Ship Lock, Huaiyin Ship Lock, and Liujian Ship Lock. Regarding flood discharge, one Yangzhuang movable dam was completed, and the Huiji Lock near Huaiyin Lock was rebuilt into a new-style spillway lock to serve navigation and irrigation on the Inner Canal. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui were successively occupied. After eight years of disrepair, coupled with the CCP's attacks and expulsions, the project was destroyed and could not be used at all. The reporter only visited Shaobo Lock, and the damage was already significant. According to the report of the Huai River Committee's Canal Basin Dyke Restoration Engineering Bureau, the damage to other locks and dams is even more severe. For example, the Huaiyin Ship Lock has been almost completely destroyed. What currently stands in the river is like an abandoned lock left over from the past. When will the unfortunate damage be rebuilt? The Huai River Committee's Dyke Restoration Engineering Bureau has currently only done survey work and small-scale projects such as culverts. Even for the survey work, it can only be done on the water surface. The damage submerged in the water must be thoroughly inspected one by one after building water-retaining dikes upstream and downstream of each lock and dam and pumping water to remove sediment. A responsible person told reporters that this year's funding has been reduced from 29 billion to 7 billion after the economic emergency measures. This year, we can only afford to buy materials, and the lock repair project seems unlikely to be completed this year.

Continuing north from Shaobo, the highway is on top of the dike. Along the way, disaster relief teams organized by nearby villagers are transporting and compacting earth. The main project is to widen the dike body. In the past, the dike surface was only 3-4 zhang (about 30-40 feet) wide, but now it has been widened to 10 meters. In the past, only one car could travel on the dike surface, but now cars can drive straight through the repaired areas. In areas where the water turns sharply and the current rushes close to the bank, earthwork alone is not enough to ensure stability, so stone revetments are added to reinforce the bank. Currently, it is the dry season, and the river water is very shallow. Ships of 20 tons or more cannot pass, especially in the area from Mazha Bay to Fanshui, where the water depth is only 3 chi (about 3 feet). The reason is that the locks have collapsed and are not maintained, so the water level cannot be controlled. At the same time, due to the impact of the Yellow River floods, the river channel has gradually been silted up, increasing by an average of 6 cun (about 2 feet) in recent years. Therefore, dredging is also an urgent task.

Currently, the work being done is only dike restoration, which is a passive defense work. The active work of navigation, irrigation, and water discharge is awaiting development. In short, after the completion of the canal dike restoration project, it is determined that the water will no longer flood, so that the affected farmland can be restored to cultivation, and the area that can avoid flooding can reach 18 million mu. If the culverts and gates on the east and west dikes are repaired and completed, the 11 million mu of farmland in the Lixia River area will have no shortage of irrigation water, and accumulated water can be discharged through the culverts and gates. The reconstruction of the dams will ensure smooth navigation. This is the only requirement of the people of Northern Jiangsu.

### A Glimpse of Taiwan Province

— Chiayi, 4th (Airmail Report) Di Dong

Taiwan is our country's territory. In ancient times, it was the land of the Eastern Yi. After the Song and Yuan dynasties, more and more people from the mainland came here. After the Sino-Japanese War in 1895, it was occupied by the Japanese. After the victory, it returned to the embrace of the motherland. Reflecting on the past and present, I can't help but feel emotional. It is a small island with an area less than a quarter of Zhejiang Province. Its shape resembles a leaf. Mountains run across the north and south, forming the backbone of the island. The west is a plain, and the east coast has many mountains. The highest peak is the southern New High Mountain. Because of its unique advantages, coupled with the Japanese's 51 years of hard work, the plains have products such as rice, sugar cane, fruit, and camphor, while the mountains have famous timber such as red cypress.

Significant Progress in Transportation Infrastructure

Speaking of the transportation and construction industry here, it is indeed 20 to 30 years more advanced than in the mainland. For example, in terms of hydropower and roads, even in remote rural areas, there are urban sanitation facilities and bright electric lights. In terms of transportation, in addition to the 400-kilometer north-south railway stretching from Keelung in the north to Hengchun in the south, and the round-the-island railway from Keelung to Suao in the north and from Hualien to Taitung, the developed highways are not inferior to the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, which are known for their widespread road construction. Because the asphalt Class A highways winding through the countryside and the shuttling vehicles are surprising and pleasing to those who come to Taiwan. As for the usable airfields in the province, there were more than 70 during the Japanese occupation. In terms of maritime transportation, there are Keelung and Tamsui in the north, Kaohsiung and Gaoping in the south, and good harbors can be built in the east. No wonder the Japanese previously regarded Taiwan as the only base for attacking the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) and the mainland of our country.

### Visiting Fuxing Brick and Tile Factory

— Nai Xin

Nanjing is a place I have visited before, a city of dignitaries and officials, with many grand residences and large gardens that retain their pre-war appearance. Zhongshan and Linggu Mountains maintain their beautiful scenery. Invited by Mr. Xu Lianxun, the manager of Fuxing Brick and Tile Factory, I visited the entire factory and felt it was worthwhile to introduce it to the public. I hereby record my observations as follows:

Fuxing Brick and Tile Factory was founded in April of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), only a year ago. At that time, the capital was two hundred million yuan, and it was a partnership. The office is located at No. 6 Baixia Road, and the factory is located at Badou, outside Heping Gate in Nanjing, about fourteen kilometers from the city. It occupies an area of ​​more than one hundred acres, with several factory buildings built among the mountains. The earthen kilns stand in rows, already displaying the two colors of brick and tile, red and gray, covering the mountains and plains, creating a spectacular sight. Facing a tributary of the Yangtze River and surrounded by mountains and water, the scenery is serene and beautiful. Cars can directly reach this place, making transportation quite convenient.

Most of the Workers Were Once Soldiers

The hundreds of workers mostly come from the provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. They had served on the battlefield during the Anti-Japanese War. After being discharged, they could not return home and changed their occupation to become workers. Most of them are bachelors, but some have brought their families to live together. Food and lodging are provided by the factory, with three meals a day, rarely containing meat. When we visited each place, it was lunchtime. Groups of three or five sat on the ground, eating white rice and garlic with relish. Apart from working, eating, and sleeping, they have no entertainment. They live in the mountains all year round, unaware of the changes in the world. The work is entirely based on a contract system, with a foreman managing each group. Wages depend on work experience, ranging from tens of thousands to three or four hundred thousand per month, but they are not paid monthly, only settled during the three major festivals, with only some pocket money provided during normal times.

Each Brick and Tile Represents Hardship

The production of bricks and tiles takes about two weeks. First, the mud is mixed and formed into bricks, then placed on a large field to dry. After drying, they are moved into the earthen kilns, each kiln holding thirty to forty thousand bricks and tiles. They are fired with coal for up to ninety-six hours, day and night. The kiln workers take turns on duty. The kiln can only be opened one or two days after the fire is extinguished. When mature, they are red. To make blue-gray bricks and tiles, they must be watered for a day and a night. The biggest cost of making bricks and tiles is fuel.

Product Improvement Foundation Laid

The capital is in a period of reconstruction, and the housing shortage is particularly serious. Construction is a timely undertaking, and bricks and tiles are essential building materials. The factory's business development is expected. Production cannot meet demand, so the factory purchased a generator from General Electric in the United States last year and ordered various parts from Shanghai Dahua Iron Works. The installation has been completed, and mass production is now possible. After transitioning from manual earthen production to mechanized production, the products are becoming more refined. Business is booming every month, and there are still plans for improvement in the future. I visited the factory for several hours and deeply felt that although the factory was recently founded, it has already achieved such results. The foundation of the initial business has been laid here. This is due to manpower, materials, and opportunity, but it is also because all departments and personnel can work together and work hard.

Spring and Autumn

### The French Epic After Zola

— Zhao Jingshen

After Zola's masterpiece "Rougon-Macquart Cycle," another continuous epic has emerged in France today. This is Jules Romains' "Men of Good Will." The entire book consists of fourteen volumes, with the following table of contents: (1) Men of Good Will, (2) Passion's Pilgrims, (3) The Proud and the Meek (translated into English by Warre B. Wells), (4) The World from Below, (5) The Earth Trembles, (6) The Depths and the Heights, (7) Death of A World, (8) Verdun, (9) Aftermath, (10) The New Day, (11) Work and Play, (12) The Wind Is Raising, (13) Escape in Passion, (14) The Seventh of Octhober (all translated by Gerard Hopkins). It is said to be the most enduring work of modern fiction, synthesizing French social, political, and spiritual life, and discussing Europe as well. The time period is from October 6, 1908, to October 7, 1933.

Jules Romains has written many novels, plays, poems, and essays, which have influenced not only France but also Europe and the United States. The most famous of these is this great work "Men of Good Will," which he and critics alike acknowledge as his masterpiece. He first conceived of writing this work thirty years ago. Actual writing began in 1931. He said that all his works were merely preparations and exercises for this monumental work. He visited the United States in 1936 and again in 1939, staying at the PEN Club and delivering his famous wartime democracy speech. After the fall of France in 1940, Jules Romains lived in the United States and Mexico. He has now returned to France.

If you share the tumultuous and passionate life narrated by Jules Romains, you will see the shattering of the old world and the struggling growth of the new world; you will dream, doubt, and despair; you will experience many storms and dangers with the author; in the individual lives of over a thousand people, you will observe the astonishing drama of this era. This is Paris, this is France, this is Europe, this is our world, our time.

"No historian can write the history of 1918 to 1933 as profoundly as this," said biographer Andre Maurois. "Jules Romains seems better than anyone else, he writes about a small group of fortunate people who have pondered for a long time, thinking that they can rebuild Europe."

Jules Romains can be said to be of the Rabelais school. His style is fluent and imaginative. He approaches life with the attitude of an artist, and his literary interests are primarily aesthetic. He is a pillar of bourgeois culture. He considers himself to belong to the Balzac and Zola category.

This great work is progressing slowly. Many characters take little action, but merely express the author's opinions on literature, sex, ethics, and so on. The two main characters are actually Jules Romains himself. Pierre Jallez is introspective, poetic, and sensitive, while Jean Jerphanion is objective, normal, and skeptical. His "Verdun" is the best of these novels. For example, he writes: the birth of a baby; a poor child playing with an iron hoop, dreaming of life; the people of Paris awakening on a beautiful morning, with majestic cries opposing the bestiality of the First World War.

### Mountain City Sentiments

— Yan Zhewu

Fried Rice Candy Water

At night, although the roads in the mountain city are quiet, there are always some pedestrians walking around. After twelve o'clock, the theater closed, and the audience went to restaurants specializing in the night market to have a "midnight snack" before going home to sleep, which was at least one o'clock the next morning. After two o'clock, pig herders shouted as they drove their pigs into the slaughterhouse. The fog enveloped the streetlights, blurring the figures. The watchman knocked on bamboo clappers, but the vendors selling "fried rice candy water" were still wandering the streets, calling out in long voices. Gamblers, opium smokers, and poor intellectuals, all those with a "nightlife," needed this square piece of fried rice candy in hot water, warm and sweet, to relieve their hunger and cold in the deep night. Those who were a bit wealthier would add one or two eggs, which was also delicious. Because it was late at night and nothing else was available, "fried rice candy water" became the only precious item.

The night deepened, and the sky gradually brightened. After three o'clock, those rushing to catch the steamboat, carrying vegetables, and transporting goods took advantage of the sparse crowds and good roads at midnight to rush to work. In the hearts of these laborers, there was already a "daylight saving time," so the "eating market" in the second half of the night was even more lively. At the dock, there were always soy milk, fried dough sticks, and fermented rice wine eggs. Also, there was a "wonton stall" that opened from six in the evening until dawn. Their lives were "night as day, day as night!"

Life is like competing ships, just like the turbulent flow of the Jialing River. In the twenty-four-hour cycle of day and night, people competing for a living must seize every minute. Naturally, this tense and exhausting competition often makes people feel breathless under pressure. If you don't believe me, listen to the long cries in the deep alleys when the night is quiet and people are asleep—"fried rice—candy—water"—you can feel the poignant and resentful emotions.

Telling Tall Tales

Why is "chatting" called "telling a dragon gate formation"? Excuse me, I have not "traced its origin," but this phrase shows how much the people of Sichuan love a leisurely life. In Chongqing, you can see many teahouses, and they are always full of people. These people naturally come to "tell dragon gate formations." People who come to the mountain city for the first time are not used to it, but after living there for a long time, everyone becomes accustomed to "hanging out in teahouses." Even now that we have returned to Jiangnan, we still feel the inconvenience of not having so many teahouses.

Once, in Shanhui, I saw an advanced woman shouting loudly to the people sitting in the teahouse in a marching parade: "Fellow countrymen who are living in a drunken dream, the Japanese devils are going to destroy our country, stop hanging out in teahouses!" But the people leaning on the railings watching the parade looked at her indifferently. Everyone continued to eat melon seeds, smoke leaf cigarettes, read newspapers, and chat, some even discussing business.

After living in Sichuan for a long time, I learned that every town and city has teahouses, and they serve various functions.

Teahouses are usually related to the "Gelaohui" (Brotherhood Society), each "hall" (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith). There are managers and heads of households who act as gathering places for the "brothers" every day to "meet" and discuss business. Some teahouses become gathering places for various commercial guilds to inquire about market conditions. Whenever there is a "market fair," the people in the teahouse temporarily have a natural classification! Therefore, the side effect of the teahouse is that it is set up for people who "go to the fair" to trade and rest, so it has a great relationship with the rural socio-economy and should not be underestimated.

Tea brewing includes Dafang, Longjing, Tuocha, chrysanthemum, and so-called "two openings" and "glass." "Two openings" means half tea leaves and half chrysanthemum, and "glass" means "plain water," which is the benefit of the waiter, and the owner does not charge. Ordinary tea is calculated by the number of bowls based on the number of small boxes of tea leaves, so sometimes the waiters brew two boxes evenly into three boxes to profit from it. In Chongqing, because people's lives are hard and housing is poor, many people, especially friends in the cultural circles, get up in the morning and go to the teahouse to wash their faces, brew tea, eat breakfast, read books, and write articles until they go back to the office or home for lunch at noon; they go again in the afternoon. There are many people who use teahouses as temporary offices, liaison offices, and workplaces. However, this kind of teahouse is relatively upscale, like the teahouse in Chongqing Zhongshan Park, where there are newspaper sellers, shoe shiners, and people selling fountain pens and telling fortunes.

The only temptation when sitting in a teahouse is the melon seeds placed on the table. Once you start eating, you eat one plate after another, and the waiter will bring up one plate after another, because this is his special benefit.

In the mountain city, there are often power outages and water outages, so teahouses often grab water and increase tea prices. In summer, water is even more precious; sometimes, when the water is cut off, the teahouse will close down.

The teahouse is a good place to tell dragon gate formations and is also the most economical place to pass the time. At first glance, it doesn't seem that way; after a long time, you deeply feel the convenience of the teahouse. After the restoration, in the "theater teahouse" in Beijing and Shanghai, a cup of tea costs seven or eight thousand yuan, which really makes people recall the cheapness of the mountain city teahouse; thinking about the comfortable state of lying on a bamboo chair in the mountain city teahouse, I still can't help but "yearn for it"!

The Sentiment of Wine

During the war, alcohol was prohibited in the mountain city, and restaurants were not allowed to play guessing games and drink, but some people still used tea bowls to hold wine and spoons instead of cups to drink it sip by sip. When the "inspection team" came, the lid was placed on the tea bowl and placed in front of someone as if nothing had happened, leaving no trace. At the same time, it was stipulated that liquor stores selling cold liquor could only sell peanuts and dried tea, not cooked dishes, so "cold liquor stores" were popular for a while. Sichuanese people do not like to drink yellow wine, and "white liquor" and "large noodles" are the most popular. Selling wine is based on the number of cups, and two or three confidants can chat while drinking and still get drunk.

Except for Chengdu and Chongqing, the counties in Sichuan do not prohibit alcohol. The host considers "encouraging drinking" (meaning using methods to persuade people to drink) as a skill, and many of us have been "trapped." Therefore, those who are clever never start drinking before a banquet, otherwise, if they "make an exception" once, then they will concentrate their attack, and the result is "no return without getting drunk." Therefore, those in Sichuan with a large capacity for alcohol often have nicknames such as "drunk for seven days," "drunkard," and "never wakes up from being drunk."

In winter, the fog enveloped the mountain city, and the hazy night scene, seen through eyes with a bit of drunkenness, was particularly mysterious. In the past, I loved the streetlights of Avenue Joffre in Shanghai, but in the past ten years, I have loved the wine atmosphere of the mountain city even more!

### Young Girl (Oil Painting)

### Black Tea

— Luo Yingfeng

This is a small pool of marsh water

Sleeping with the sunset of midsummer

Blooming algae burst out their last fragrance

Withering in the rich marsh gas

The small water village is isolated from the world

A slender thread of inspiration originates here

A high pavilion of thought rises on the shore

Petals of dreams continue to flutter by the water

Being a temporary hermit in this water village

Turning worries into a resounding little poem

Drawing on fresh strength

Returning to the world with big steps

### Meeting

Electricity and electricity in the air

Met

A long kiss

——The universe exploded with the sound of thunder

People and people in the world

Met

Hand in hand

### Pillbox Night

— Shi Ying

Immersed in the vast night,

The wilderness is like a dead sea.

A solitary island standing tall,

This silent fortress.

A shivering star in the sky;

A shivering light ahead.

Intermittent barking of dogs,

Accompanying the lonely figure.

Looking down and stroking the familiar gun,

Memories of a hundred battles.

The night conceals

The broken fields,

Making it even harder to see

The new greenery.

Immersed in the vast night,

The wind is still so desolate,

A distant, mournful cry——

A sigh,

A desolate tear.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 507

— Ye Jingfeng

Today's situation is completely different from the above. Although the actions of the person knocking on the door were so mysterious, when you met, seeing her so innocent and frank, it seemed that there was nothing mysterious at all. How could you know that she was not young and timid, and afraid to be bold? If you wanted to say that she was acting with hostility, looking at her face full of childishness, smiling, and polite; her simple summer clothes, with her arms exposed, unless you had seen a time bomb planted in advance, you couldn't even see a hairpin. Not to mention pistols, electric knives, or swords, you couldn't find a trace of hostility no matter what.

Neither particularly mysterious nor hostile, but coming so suddenly, laughing and playful, and also a woman, so Hejian was stunned for a moment and couldn't get rid of her; besides an "oh," there was nothing more. At the same time, Hejian's heart full of distress and anxiety on this day was also the biggest factor that froze him in front of this woman.

"Really taking the liberty, Mr. Gu!" When the woman saw Hejian standing there dumbfounded, she spoke again, and the three words "zhuluomi" suddenly changed to a "Gu" character. This change of address showed that her attitude was slightly more serious than before, and also showed that she was very familiar with Hejian's past: "I heard that I have an older brother who came here to talk to you, sir. I have a small matter to find him at this time, but I don't know that he has already... I don't know him... I guess he... I heard that he... maybe he will come again..."

This role is simply making trouble, isn't it? First of all, since she has taken the liberty to break into the place of someone she has never met before, according to normal logic, she should explain in one breath "My name is what, who is my older brother..." Introduce herself so that people can understand what is going on. Second, especially making trouble: her last half sentence turned three or four turns when she said it; at one point, it seemed that she was saying that her brother "has already..." Presumably, it was always "has already gone;" at another point, she wanted to say "I don't know him..." Presumably, it was "I don't know that he has already left." At one point, it seemed that she was saying "I guess he..." Perhaps she was saying "I guess he will come again..." At one point, she said "Maybe he will come again..."

Although her second half of the sentence turned three or four times, it clearly proved that this role was a big liar; because her words didn't match each other; she said that her brother "came here... to talk," listening to her tone, it was clear that she already knew that her brother had left, if he hadn't left, where did she hear these words from? Isn't that right? But then she said that she "didn't know that he had already left..." When she said it, she felt that this was inappropriate, so she quickly turned her tone three times. However, from these two sentences, it can be proved that this role does not have any great talent for lying. Because the biggest secret of a true lying expert is to speak "definitely": what is yin is yin, what is mao is mao, and you must not waver so that the listener has half a doubt.

Her words turned three times, even Hejian, whose thoughts were as chaotic as hemp, could hear the problem:

"Miss, what is your honorable surname?... Who is your older brother?..."

Hejian's question was extremely reasonable; no matter who, where, or when, if you meet someone you don't know and hear the other person say that, of course, you would ask this question. At the same time, Hejian's question was of course an opening statement. In theory, after Hejian asked this, the other person should state their name grandly, and explain who the "older brother" is, and return to her maiden home, which would be reasonable. Guess how she answered after hearing Hejian's question?

### A Passive View of Occupation

— Bali

Some time ago, I wrote a short article on "Occupational Mood," mentioning that young friends today generally hold a low and detached mood. This mood is expanding as the days become more difficult, which is a serious impression.

Today, every employee seems to be annoyed, annoyed by the heavy workload, annoyed by insufficient learning, and even more annoyed by meager treatment. However, despite the annoyance, they can only stubbornly stick to it. Because industry and commerce are declining, it is not easy to maintain the status quo, let alone expand. Therefore, there are plans to lay off employees and reduce salaries, trying to reduce the number of employees. Even if one person is employed, they are given double or triple the amount of work as before. Therefore, as an employee, a sense of unease and dissatisfaction with the occupation arises. But what can you do? So, they just go through the motions, generating a "muddling through" concept.

Originally, occupation should be the combination of ideal and practice. Dedicating oneself to an occupation means preparing to develop oneself and achieve one's ideals on this path. However, in today's difficult times, the pursuit of occupation cannot follow one's own wishes, and fully seeking employment is just a saying and a theory. Therefore, one can only try one's luck, seize an opportunity, and treat "a branch to perch on" as just a means to earn a living.

If one only regards occupation as a means to earn a living, this not only destroys the deep meaning of occupation but also loses a sense of enthusiasm and interest in employment. Therefore, the view of occupation is very passive. One only seeks to survive temporarily, without long-term plans, and naturally there is no ideal to speak of. And the mood toward occupation is not boredom or resentment, but a nonchalant attitude, treating it as a chicken rib.

This passive view of occupation not only affects the employee's will to live, but also affects the progress of construction if the country is at peace. Fortunately, this concept arises under unstable circumstances. If the social environment can reach the stage of free choice of occupation and full employment, this passive concept may be completely eliminated. However, today, according to the China Vocational Education Society, the employment rate is as low as 14 percent, which means that only 14 out of 100 people seeking employment get a job, which shows how bad the employment situation is today. But we must not lose hope, just like the general employees who muddle through with a passive concept, we always hope that there will be a day of peace and construction.

### Listening to the Ministry of Education Symphony Orchestra

— Xin Geng

The Ministry of Education's China Symphony Orchestra has recently started performing in Nanjing. They hold a weekly concert at the Xindu Theater every Sunday, performing some famous pieces.

This orchestra is quite well-organized, with more than 30 musicians, conducted by Lin Shengxi. Some of the musicians are former members of the Sun Yat-sen University Orchestra, and of course, there are quite a few talented players.

Today is the fifth weekly concert in their spring season. I listened to it once. There were six programs in total. The first was Beethoven's "Prometheus" Overture, followed by "Minuet," "Hungarian Dance No. 2 and No. 7," and "Barcarolle," etc. The last one was Beethoven's "Eroica Symphony." Although their ability is not enough to play these quite heavy pieces (especially the "Eroica Symphony"), they have done their best.

The "Prometheus" Overture was performed very solemnly. The first few short, sharp chords immediately drew the audience's attention and added a lot of solemn atmosphere to the venue. Then, the music gradually calmed down, allowing the audience to relax their spirits slightly in order to continue listening to these beautiful movements.

"Minuet" is a lively piece that controlled the lively atmosphere of the entire venue. Then, "Hungarian Dance No. 2" was steady and powerful, and then "Hungarian Dance No. 7" returned to a relaxed mood. The atmosphere was always changing like this.

After a fifteen-minute break, the "grand finale" of the "Eroica Symphony" (Beethoven's Third Symphony) began. It was divided into four movements. The first movement was fast and brilliant, the second movement was a funeral march, which was more solemn, the third movement was a scherzo, and the fourth movement was the finale. In this symphony, the orchestra fully demonstrated their efforts. Conductor Lin Shengxi is a famous musician in China. His hands and facial expressions fully expressed the joys, sorrows, and joys in the music, deeply moving the audience. When the piece ended, Mr. Lin also breathed a sigh of relief as if he had unloaded a heavy burden, and he was already sweating profusely.

The only large orchestra in China is the Shanghai Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra, but most of them are foreign musicians. The China Symphony Orchestra is probably the only purely Chinese orchestra. Chinese music is backward, and we hope that these two orchestras will continue to grow and work hard to win a breath for the Chinese music scene.

### News Digest

— Tie Yun

We believe that rice merchants certainly have their difficulties, but using radio broadcasts or newspaper reports as justification for resorting to violence is not a method that rice merchants should adopt. If everything is resolved through "force," all criticism and public opinion will be silenced, allowing "dictatorship" to reign supreme.

The masses may indeed be blind, but those who lead them must take full responsibility. We cannot attribute everything to "popular anger."

Stabilizing the rice market still relies on stabilizing prices and maintaining the currency's stability. When prices are stable, everything can be resolved smoothly.

The actress Ying Zi has passed away, which is merely a reflection of the "end" for all film and theater professionals. How many film and theater professionals or cultural workers live and die well? Frankly, to cultivate the nation's vitality, we must treat cultural workers with greater generosity.

In the past, there was a grand plan for a New Shanghai, which included building the Shanghai Municipal Government and various bureaus' offices in the city center. However, the city center is quite desolate now. Given Shanghai's dense population, why not move the municipal government to the city center?

One evening, I overheard two people in uniform on duty discussing Shanghai's roads. They praised the former Shanghai Municipal Council's conscientious road construction but shook their heads at the current sloppy road repairs. We don't know the truth, but locally, the roads are full of scars, with uneven surfaces. Is this because there is not enough funding for road repairs?

### "Returning Home in Glory"

— Wu Bian

"Returning Home in Glory" depicts a young teacher, Lin Daojun, who resolutely leaves his wife, children, and friends to participate in war zone work after the "August 13th Incident" (the start of the Battle of Shanghai). He serves on the front lines but cannot endure the harsh life of the war zone. He flees to the rear in Chongqing, changes his profession to business, and unexpectedly becomes wealthy, transforming into a minor official-merchant figure. After the victory, he returns to Shanghai as a receiver of assets, "returning home in glory." He inevitably seeks stimulation in dance halls, resulting in a relationship with his daughter—his daughter is forced into a life of embracing in dance halls due to factory closures. The story ends with his wife's death, his daughter's departure, and himself suffering the condemnation of his conscience in the snow. This is a tragic ethical drama. The author vigorously chastises the intellectuals who wavered during the war of resistance. He also strips away the facade of those receivers of assets and official-merchant figures, exposing their inner ugliness, allowing people to see how shameless and pathetic these returning home in glory individuals are. This is the author's accusation of justice.

However, the author attributes Lin Daojun's wavering during the war of resistance solely to his weak character and inability to endure hardship, neglecting the objective reasons of society. This is an error due to the author's lack of deep understanding of reality. Furthermore, it is unreasonable that Xiao Ling and Lin Daojun, being in love, fail to recognize Lin as her father, while Lin's wife, following Xiao Ling and Daojun's rendezvous, can recognize her husband of eight years with just a glance through the glass window, especially since Xiao Ling's home has enlarged photos of her parents. Lin Daojun does not change much in the eight years on the screen.

Moreover, after the victory, there were many tragic stories of separation and reunion that could be written, but the author focuses on the love between father and daughter. This tendency toward a perverted psychology is precisely the author's vulgarity.

In terms of performance, Zhao Dan, as a new director, is quite successful. He handles the entire play in a simple and realistic manner, without vulgar gimmicks, which is commendable. The only flaw is the sloppiness in the connection between scenes. If this film could be edited more tightly, this flaw could be remedied. Finally, the scene where Lin Daojun returns to the empty house and suffers the condemnation of his conscience after his wife's death and daughter's departure is an unnecessary tail. If it could be deleted, the story would end more forcefully and cleanly.

Gu Eryi's Lin Daojun is better in the later scenes than in the earlier ones. His status and demeanor are very fitting, and his physical appearance helps him. Tan Ying's Xu Hui is very hardworking but unremarkable. In terms of makeup, she should have been made to look older to match her difficult life. Zhang Yan's rickshaw puller has a very likable role, but his performance is just average. Sun Xia's Li Jiacheng is still steady, while Xu Zuoqi's Xiao Ling's expression is very stiff, perhaps because it is her first time on camera and she is nervous. It is worth mentioning that the pair of young actors, Ye Xiaokeng and Yu Fuying, especially the former, have more lively and natural acting skills.

Although this film has script defects, the overall performance is still a passable film and is worth introducing to audiences who care about domestic films.

### Copper Buttons

— Hong Tao

Officials of the late Qing Dynasty wore mandarin jackets for formal occasions and overcoats for casual wear, both with copper buttons down the front, arranged like cherries. Today, the mandarin jacket is still used as formal attire, but the buttons have evolved from copper buttons into elaborate sets of buttons. However, the origins of the copper button system are unknown. When I asked the elders, I learned that this system began in the Yongzheng era. Emperor Yongzheng, having gained the throne through usurpation, was extremely suspicious. At that time, heroes of the common people who had not forgotten the Ming Dynasty still posed a threat of resurgence. Even the emperor's relatives were all eager to get rid of him. Therefore, the emperor recruited martial arts experts to attend him daily to prevent unforeseen events. One day, during a court assembly, someone suddenly jumped down from the corner of the wall of the palace. The courtiers all looked at each other in dismay. Later, it was learned that an assassin had been lurking in the corner of the house, trying to snipe the emperor. No one else had noticed, but a Han censor caught a glimpse of it. The censor was known for his skill in shooting pellets. However, in the rush, he did not have time to draw an arrow, and the emperor was still on the throne; suddenly using force might alert the assassin and allow him to escape, leaving no proof and incurring the charge of disrespect. Therefore, the censor plucked a button from his mandarin jacket and struck the assassin's eyes. The assassin, in pain, fell to the ground, still clutching a dagger, which was shiny and less than a foot long, its edge menacing. Upon interrogation, he confessed to being an assassin. From then on, the double-breasted copper button was established as the censor's regular uniform. Over time, scholars and officials all imitated it, and it became a custom, and no one could remember the story behind it anymore.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"Director Hou, this is the car!" Director Xiong said with a beaming smile, pointing to the car towards the middle-aged man, "This car is relatively new. It will definitely not break down! Hahaha!"

"Haha...!" The middle-aged man echoed with an unnatural laugh.

"What? There's already someone on the driver's platform!" The female guest who came with him, Lao Mi, had already seen a plump woman sitting on the driver's platform of the car, so her face fell and she asked loudly.

This was obviously beyond Director Xiong's expectations. He turned around to take a closer look, and his face flushed with anger. The skinny driver actually heard that this group of people was coming, so his face was no better than Director Xiong's.

"Driver! Why did you let this woman sit here?" The young Director Xiong strode forward and said imposingly, "Tell her to get down! Get down immediately!"

The skinny driver did not speak, he felt a little hesitant. When the car is moving, the driver is above everything else. This is the iron rule forged on the highway over the past few years of the War of Resistance. What is Director Xiong? Why should he be afraid of him? However, now the car has not yet started, and his immediate superior—the company commander of the Ziqi × Regiment's × Company—is also here. Not taking this into account is obviously not going to work.

The company commander Liu was afraid that things would get out of hand, so he also came up.

He cleverly winked at the hesitant driver first, and then shouted loudly:

"Deng Guozhong, tell that woman to get down! This is Director Hou and Mrs. Hou, introduced by Commander ×. You must give up this driver's seat! Did you hear that?"

The skinny Deng driver heard that it was such a big deal, and he felt half softened; however, the fat woman who had already gotten into the car was his patron, the one who spent money on him, so how could he ask her to get out of the car? (6) (9)
