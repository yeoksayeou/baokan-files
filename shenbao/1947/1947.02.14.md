### Emergency Measures to Curb Inflation: Extensive Consultations Largely Finalized; Entire Plan Submitted to Chairman for Approval

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The government is currently making efforts on two fronts to quell the current alarming situation of soaring gold prices, US dollar values, and overall inflation. Regarding the stabilization of gold and US dollar prices, Song Ziwen (T.V. Soong) and Bei Zuyi (Tsuyee Pei) are fully handling the matter. Measures to stabilize commodity prices are being drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in conjunction with the Ministries of Social Affairs and Food, the Transportation Commission, and the municipal and economic authorities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The entire emergency plan, after several consultations under the direction of Chairman Chiang, involving relevant officials over the past three days, has largely been finalized and will be submitted to the Chairman for approval on the evening of the 13th. The meeting at Chairman Chiang's official residence on the 13th lasted until 11:00 PM before adjourning.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs held an important meeting on the 13th. Wang Yunwu presided, and attendees included Pan Xulun, Xiao Lu, Gu Zhenglun, Pang Songzhou, Ling Hongxun, Wu Zhaohong, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Yi, Huang Bodu, and others. Opinions were exchanged on stabilizing commodity prices, and some decisions were made. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM. It is reported that commodity price stabilization will proceed on two fronts simultaneously. One involves distributing supplies in kind to civil servants, and the other concerns wages. The cotton yarn, fuel, and rice held by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Food will be distributed to civil servants. As for the distribution mechanism, the Ministry of Social Affairs advocates using existing cooperatives, and the Ministry of Transportation will assist with transportation. It is also reported that this will be piloted along the Nanjing-Shanghai line first. Measures are also being considered to stabilize wages. After the meeting, Wang Yunwu and others went to Song Ziwen's residence for further consultations at 4:00 PM and then to the Chairman's official residence at 7:00 PM for instructions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Regarding the supply of daily necessities to public school teachers and government employees, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has scheduled a meeting of representatives from relevant agencies for the 14th to discuss whether to provide rations of daily necessities to public school teachers and government employees, and what specific measures to take. Long Dajun, Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, went to Shanghai a few days ago to invite representatives from relevant agencies to come to Nanjing for consultations. Mr. Long, together with representatives from the China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC), the Fuel Management Committee, and the Shanghai Materials Supply Bureau, including Wu Weijing, arrived in Nanjing this afternoon.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen is expected to arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 14th to attend an important meeting held by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Wu Weijing, representing CTIC, and Xu Shanyang, representing the Fuel Management Committee, have arrived in Nanjing ahead of schedule.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The tentatively named Economic Policy Research Committee is being organized, with a preliminary list of fifteen members including Song Ziwen, Yu Hongjun, Chen Guofu, Xu Kan, Chen Lifu, Pan Gongzhan, Xiao Zheng, Lou Tongshen, and Huang Yuanbin. The committee will be established after Chairman Chiang's approval. The number of people will be eight or nine, and some prominent figures from the industrial and commercial sectors will also participate.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Ministry of Food has dispatched Shen Guojin, Director of the Storage and Transportation Department, to various provinces along the Yangtze River to supervise the transportation of food grains in order to regulate supply.

### The United States Cannot Stand Idly By in the Face of China's Economic Chaos: The New York Times Comments on China's Financial Situation

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 13th (Radio): The New York Times commented that the catastrophic drop and subsequent rebound in China's currency value demonstrates that the country's economic collapse may not be as rapid as generally imagined recently. This rebound may only be temporary, but unless the Chinese people still have some faith in their government's ability to control the crisis, this temporary stability cannot be maintained. It would be a grave mistake to think of this as merely a Chinese problem. It is also an American problem, and a serious one, because the United States is a friend of China, and we cannot stand idly by and watch it fall into an irrecoverable situation, commented the New York World-Telegram.

### US Halts Loans to China: Precipitating China's Crisis

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 13th (Radio): The New York World-Telegram commented on China's economic crisis, saying that this situation was caused by the United States halting loans to China. The newspaper also criticized [John Carter] Vincent's policy of distrust towards China.

### US-China Trade Stagnates: Importers and Exporters Hit Hard

[United Press, San Francisco, 13th] The Executive Secretary of the American Importers and Exporters Association, Wright Clevely, stated today that fluctuations in the Chinese legal tender (fabi) have brought US-China trade to a standstill. Importers and exporters are the hardest hit, and American firms are now canceling orders en masse, awaiting a stable situation. Unless the value of the legal tender is firmly established, we anticipate repercussions within a week. This can be seen in the reduced number of ships sailing to the East. "We can only hope that the Chinese government recognizes that the US dollar has three different values in China." The Chinese government's foreign exchange buying and selling rules, limiting the purchase of imports and exports to a maximum value of US$2,000, as well as last week's implementation of a 50% import surcharge, the proceeds of which subsidize exports, are also factors restricting trade.

### US Will Not Impose Additional Taxes to Resist Chinese Import Taxes

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Regarding the Nanjing government's subsidization of Chinese exporters, the United States will not impose additional import taxes on Chinese goods as a countermeasure. A Treasury Department spokesman stated today that the US Tariff Act of 1930 stipulates that if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that foreign goods have been subsidized by their government, an additional tax should be levied on these goods upon entry into the United States. The decision rests with the Secretary of the Treasury. If the Nanjing government's export subsidy measures are deemed to fall within the scope of the US tariff law, then punitive additional import taxes may not be levied on these Chinese goods. When similar situations have occurred, thorough research is required before a decision can be made, and the same applies to the current situation in China. US officials hope that the Chinese authorities can maintain the value of the legal tender themselves, and the United States will not provide any assistance. The United States will not provide loans for any specific Chinese projects at this time, and the Export-Import Bank's accounts for China have been temporarily sealed.

### Factors Contributing to Soaring Prices: Legislative Yuan Nine-Member Committee to Prepare Report

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The issue of gold prices and commodity prices will be a major topic on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan's general meeting on the 14th. The Yuan's nine-member committee will present an important report at the meeting, explaining the various factors contributing to soaring prices. The seven most serious problems currently identified in the report are as follows: (1) The government focuses only on one or two industries and businesses that are easier to manage and more profitable, and state-owned enterprises often raise prices first, leading the way for private enterprises to raise prices. The cost of daily necessities has skyrocketed, and all prices have increased over ten thousand-fold, seemingly without end. (2) The issuance of paper money increases daily, and production loans have not been fully implemented. The authorities believe that selling gold and controlling foreign exchange can lower prices, but the issuance of paper money cannot keep pace with production. The more paper money is issued, the higher the price of gold rises. The so-called lowering of prices has the opposite effect. Moreover, China is not a gold-producing country, and current foreign trade is almost zero. The existing foreign exchange reserves are also not unlimited. Speculators see the loopholes and stir up trouble. The government fails to notice this and uses loans to fuel the rising prices, leading to an uncontrollable situation. (3) Most state-owned enterprises do not benefit the people's livelihood, and their illegal and excessive expenditures are staggering. The China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC) has illegally spent as much as 42.7 billion. (4) Since the government collected gold reserves and bonds from the people and paid US dollar bonds at the original face value, its credibility has been shattered. Furthermore, with the devaluation of the currency to nearly one ten-thousandth of its original value, the debt is still paid at one yuan per yuan, making it impossible to issue bonds, and funding relies entirely on paper money. (5) Subsidy policies only increase government spending and stimulate prices. (6) Public school teachers, government employees, soldiers, and police officers are often in a state of hunger and cold, while the Inspector General of Customs receives a monthly salary of 700 pounds in British currency, a vast difference. (7) There is an increasing number of overlapping and redundant organizations, creating positions for people and wasting public funds beyond estimation. In addition, the principles of the Four National Banks Law, which was previously subject to reconsideration, will also be discussed at the meeting on the 14th.

### National Assembly Representatives and Others Stationed in Shanghai to Announce Their Views on the Current Situation

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] National Assembly representatives and National Political Council members stationed in Shanghai, considering the severity of the current situation, held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at No. 1 Maoling Villa, Fulili Road. More than 30 people attended, including Chen Qitian, Jiang Yong, Jiang Yiping, Zhu Fengwei, Duanmu Kai, Xi Yushu, He Yuanming, Zhu Huijing, Li Hongwen, Wu Yunshu, Wu Wentian, Jiang Jianbai, and Zhou Feicheng. Jiang Yong was elected as chairman. The chairman asked Zhu Huijing to give a preliminary report, which generally stated that at the close of the National Assembly, government reorganization seemed immediately achievable, but more than 50 days have passed, and it is still under discussion and has not been implemented. With the end of peace talks, the war has intensified, and the scope is expanding. Recently, the gold rush has surged, prices have skyrocketed, and the people cannot make a living. However, the central government's suppression policies are still pending. People are in a state of anxiety and cannot live in peace. As National Assembly representatives or National Political Council members, they have received the important trust of the people and should have a clear position. Therefore, everyone is invited to offer advice and discuss the matter at length today. Those who spoke in turn included Chen Qitian, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, Dai Tianqiu, Jiang Jianbai, Hu Qiuhou, Duanmu Kai, Pan Lianru, Zhu Fengwei, and He Yuanming. The following was decided: (1) The government should reorganize as soon as possible. (2) A democratic political system should be established. (3) The highest officials responsible for creating the gold rush should be held accountable. (4) A law for the election of the next National Assembly representatives should be formulated, and we should participate in the process. (5) The government should be urged to establish a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee as soon as possible. Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Zhu Huijing were appointed to draft the statement on the current situation, and Jiang Yong and two others were appointed to present the same statement at the meeting of resident council members. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

### Truth Behind Gold and Commodity Price Fluctuations: Control Yuan Dispatches Investigators; Revised Measures for Control Committee Members' Inspection Tours Approved

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Control Yuan convened its 104th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 13th. More than 30 committee members, including Yan Zhuang and Wang Dong, attended. Yuan President [Yu Youren] first reported on important work over the past month, followed by a discussion on the measures for dispatching Control Committee members to various localities for inspection, which were revised and approved. In view of the recent drastic fluctuations in gold and commodity prices, which are of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, a special discussion was proposed and it was decided to select four committee members, He Hanwen, Gu Fengxiang, Zhang Qingzhen, and Wan Can, and to add several auditors from the Ministry of Audit to jointly thoroughly investigate the truth behind the gold price fluctuations, whether there have been improper measures or other corrupt practices, in order to make corrections and suggestions.

### Gold and US Dollar Prices High But Unavailable in Many Places; Food and Supplies Rise Further; Guangzhou Authorities Announce Military Law for Inflating Prices

Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Nanjing gold rush, which began at noon on the 12th and continued until the morning of the 13th, saw gold prices plummet due to hoarders softening and selling off their holdings as much as possible. However, starting at 11:00 AM, prices began to rise again. By the time the market closed in the evening, prices had jumped back above the 7 million mark. The price fluctuations throughout the 13th were as follows: The opening price was 6.5 million for selling and 5.8 million for buying, which was then changed to 6.7 million for selling and 6 million for buying. By 11:00 AM, prices clearly rose, with 6.9 million for selling and 6.2 million for buying. At 2:00 PM, the price was 7 million for selling and 6.3 million for buying. There were slight fluctuations after that, and the closing prices were 7.35 million for selling and 6.65 million for buying. Overall, there were only sellers and no buyers in the morning, while the situation was slightly more balanced in the afternoon.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Commodity prices in Nanjing have soared recently due to the stimulation of gold and US dollar fluctuations. However, over the past day or two, while gold prices have fallen, the prices of goods in Nanjing that have risen have not fallen along with gold and US dollar prices, but have continued to rise gradually. During this latest surge in gold and US dollar prices, in addition to cotton yarn, hardware, and pigments related to foreign exchange, daily necessities such as food have also been affected by the fluctuations in gold and US dollar prices. Market prices fluctuate easily, and merchants in various industries are hoarding large quantities of goods, restricting sales, creating a situation where prices are high but unavailable. Gasoline has increased from 1,800 yuan to 3,000 yuan per gallon, and some gas stations have stopped selling gasoline. Those that remain open limit each car to only three gallons. Cars form long queues near gas stations, often numbering in the hundreds. Regarding rice, even if inferior rice is used as superior rice, the market price has risen to over 100,000 yuan per stone, but there are still shortages. Each person can only buy one dou of rice. The limited price of flour is 36,000 yuan per bag, but the market price has automatically risen to 60,000 yuan, and buyers are crowded, with supply falling short of demand. A small number of speculators profit from the rise in gold and US dollar prices, while the entire nation suffers from rising commodity prices.

Suzhou

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 13th] The Suzhou Defense Headquarters convened a meeting on the morning of the 13th, inviting the county government, the county Provisional Council, the Party Headquarters, the General Labor Union, the Chamber of Commerce, the Suzhou High Court, the Police Bureau, and other agencies to discuss measures to suppress commodity prices. Major General Cao Yongxiang presided over the meeting, and it was decided on the spot to organize a Suzhou Economic Stabilization Provisional Committee, under which three organizations would be established: a price negotiation and review committee, a price management enforcement and punishment committee, and a price investigation group. These organizations would begin their work immediately.

Hangzhou

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 13th] Hangzhou was hit hard by the Shanghai gold rush, and the market was thrown into chaos. The food market also experienced extreme fluctuations, and retail shops closed one after another. The authorities tried to remedy the situation and planned to release the rice stored in warehouses and the rice held as collateral for sale today, and instructed the grain merchants to handle it openly in order to overcome the difficulties. Furthermore, students in Hangzhou schools were required to pay rice as tuition, but it was difficult to purchase. In order to solve the difficulty, the authorities, together with the Department of Education, issued an emergency notice stating that all students who had not paid rice for admission would be charged the price of Grade 1 rice sold at the municipal food rationing committee's outlets as determined at the meeting of the committee on February 10th of this year. The schools would then use this payment to purchase food grain from the Department of Finance.

Hefei

[Our Hefei Dispatch, 13th] Commodity prices here have been rising since the Spring Festival, and the increase has been particularly sharp recently. Rice has risen from over 40,000 yuan per stone to 75,000 yuan and is still rising. Kerosene and cigarettes are even more stable, rising by two to three times.

Guangzhou

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 13th] The Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters recently convened an emergency meeting and announced that anyone who spreads rumors to mislead the public and inflate prices will be punished under military law, with the death penalty. After the provincial government ordered a halt to the buying and selling of gold and foreign currency and increased the number of military police patrolling, the financial market is now in order. The trading of gold and foreign currency has been suspended, and food prices have also fallen sharply. Ordinary lower-grade rice has fallen to 100,500 yuan. The Guangdong Grain Relief Association has decided to allocate 850 tons of rice, and emergency relief will begin on the 15th. Poor people, industrial workers, and the extremely poor will be able to receive five jin each. The Guangdong Relief Branch has also allocated a batch of grain and clothing to provide relief to middle-class and upper-class poor students in the form of subsidies, and is preparing to have the students responsible for civilian education work during their spare time.

Hankou

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 13th] From last night to this afternoon, gold and grain prices have fallen together. Gold is currently listed at 710,000 yuan without additional surcharges, and rice has also fallen to 85,000 yuan. People's minds are gradually becoming more at ease.

Fuzhou

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 13th] Amidst the rising prices of grain, a tragedy occurred in Fuzhou. Police officers in the city were finding it difficult to make a living due to the high price of grain. Police officers at the Gulou Branch yesterday were unable to cook due to a lack of rice and had to stand guard while hungry. Today, they sent a representative to meet with the mayor to request the distribution of rice.

Nanchang

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 13th] The surge in commodity prices in Nanchang has slowed slightly, but the market prices of rice, oil, and daily necessities are still high.

Cotton cloth, Ping Da Wufu, was 185,000.

Tianjin

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] Due to the fall in prices in Nanjing and Shanghai, sentiment here has also weakened. The price of gold fluctuated between 700,000 and 750,000 throughout the day. The US dollar opened at 12,500 yuan in the morning. The price once reached 12,700 yuan, but in the afternoon it was still hovering between 12,000 yuan and 12,500 yuan. The food market has gradually suppressed the wind of speculation due to the authorities' supervision of transactions. The Shoufeng and Fuga flour factories did not open. The retail price was 67,000 to 68,000 yuan per bag, up 5,000 to 6,000 yuan from yesterday. As for rice, due to the small amount of goods arriving, merchants were vying to purchase, causing the price per jin to jump to 1,500 to 1,600 yuan.

Shenyang

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 13th] The price of pure gold has soared, breaking through the 90,000 yuan mark for circulating currency and is still rising, soon approaching 100,000, due to the influence of the situation within the passes (关内).

### Linyi Launches Battle for the City: National Army Advances in a Fan Shape; Communist Forces in Chengwu and Dingtao Also Encircled

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] The war situation in Southern Shandong is improving rapidly. On the morning of the 13th, the National Army advanced in a fan shape towards Linyi from Lijiazhuang, Huabu, and Nantou south of Linyi, and from Taishan, Cangshan, Zuo City, and Bianzhuang southwest of Linyi. By 4:00 PM, the vanguard was only nine kilometers from Linyi and had launched a battle for the city.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 13th] Fierce battles are taking place in the mountains on both sides of Biecang Town, southeast of Xintai. Furthermore, the Communist forces from the 7th and 11th Divisions and the Garrison Brigade, etc., gathered near Suozhen, north of Zhangdian, are attempting to probe the rear of the Liubo branch line. The National Army is on strict alert.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] According to one report, the National Army's spearhead was active at the south gate of Linyi this afternoon. However, according to official sources here, the National Army was still conducting mopping-up operations east and west of Lijiazhuang, 45 li south of Linyi, on the 13th and accepting sporadic surrenders from the Communist forces. Because Lu Yi changed the Liberated New Compilation Divisions to be responsible for the central defense south of Linyi and transferred the main forces of the New Fourth Army elsewhere, it has caused a serious backlash from his subordinates. The Liberated New Compilation Divisions were reorganized from puppet troops and militia. They know that Chen Yi is forcing them to defend the central area south of Linyi in order to use their flesh and blood to block the National Army's fierce artillery fire. Therefore, many do not fight and collapse, and they surrender to the National Army.

[Further Telegram] According to front-line news, the National Army's entry into Lijiazhuang in Southern Shandong is tantamount to a central breakthrough in Chen Yi's outer defenses of Linyi. They are now sweeping towards both flanks, capturing the main forces of the New Fourth Army. Linyi has become an empty city. Furthermore, the Communist forces under Liu Bocheng have reorganized their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th columns, totaling over 40,000 men. Starting on the evening of the 11th, they encountered the main force of the National Army in the area of Minquan and Yejigang on the western section of the Longhai Railway and fought fiercely for one day and two nights. As a result, the Communist forces suffered another crushing defeat, and the remnants fled north towards Caoxian. The National Army is pursuing them in several routes. Liu Bocheng led his troops with the aim of containing the National Army and supporting Chen Yi, but it has all been in vain.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] The forces of Liu Bocheng in Southwestern Shandong are now disintegrating. The National Army from Shanxian, Yucheng, Caoxian, and Jinxiang encircled Chengwu on three routes today and advanced to the outskirts of the city this afternoon. The Communist forces in Chengwu and Dingtao are now completely encircled by the National Army, and the time of the Communist forces' destruction is imminent. The railway bridge on the Longhai Railway in Shanxi was bombed on the night of the 12th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] After fierce battles on the Longhai Railway, the main force of Liu Bocheng's forces near Minquan was annihilated, and the remnants scattered. The National Army advancing towards Linyi in Southern Shandong has advanced north to Lijiazhuang and is advancing rapidly.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th] After suffering setbacks in the area of Minquan and Ye'egang, the main force of the Communist forces under Liu Bocheng largely fled towards Caoxian on the night of the 12th. Liu himself and his 1st Column are still in the area east of the Liu River and Sunfuji, attempting to prevent the repair of the Longhai Railway in order to block the National Army from Shangqiu from advancing west. At present, powerful units of the National Army have arrived at Xiaoba, and the gap in the Longhai Railway has been closed again. Liu Bocheng's forces have apparently been cut into two sections, and it is possible that they will be defeated piecemeal.

### New Military Deployments Expected in the North; Fierce Fighting in Western Hebei; Communist Forces from Pingyao and Other Areas Fleeing Southeast into Shanxi Province

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Sun Yunzhong is suffering from a severe cold in his legs and has not been to the headquarters for many days. There are widespread rumors here that the central government will redeploy military forces in the north, and there are also rumors that Fu Zuoyi, commander of the Twelfth War Zone, and Chen Jicheng, deputy commander of the Eleventh War Zone, may be transferred.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The National Army in Baoding is pressing on Mancheng, and Beiqicun has been captured.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 13th] The fighting in western Hebei intensified yesterday. More than 10,000 Communist troops attacked the National Army strongholds between Laishui and Yixian, and more than 20,000 Communist troops besieged towns and villages in Xushui. Fierce fighting broke out with the National Army last night. The National Army, moving south from Yixian, has recovered Da and Xiao Luo Villages and is approaching Dawangdian. About 60,000 Communist troops are gathered between Caohe and Dingdian. A major battle may break out around the periphery of Baoding.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 13th] The National Army on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is now advancing smoothly to the east and west of the railway. After one unit of the National Army recovered Yixian on the [blank] day, the Communist forces north of the Yishui River were completely defeated. Another unit of the National Army advanced westward from Gucheng, recovering Nanxinzhuang on the 7th, Jin [blank] Tai on the 8th, and Taocun (15 kilometers west of Gucheng) on the 12th. It has now crossed the Yishui River and is advancing towards Tanghu. There is no change in the fighting south of Baoding.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] A person from Bingyuan said: Daning in western Shanxi has been recovered, and a defensive network of four layers of bunkers has been built outside the city, capable of resisting 300,000 people. In addition, the Communist forces in the Taiyue area have been fiercely attacking National Army strongholds near Huolu and Jingxing for days, attempting to destroy the Jingxing mining area. The situation on the Zhengtai Railway is becoming tense.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th] Chen Guang, commander of the Taiyue Military Region, personally led six brigades, the 10th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 24th, and 26th, to harass the area between Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Fenyang. Last month, the National Army combined forces to encircle and suppress them. The Communist forces were unable to gain a foothold, so they fled southeast across the railway from the Zhanglanzhen area, both north and south. The National Army followed and pursued them, engaging in fierce battles at Huocun, Baojiadian, Dongxi Yangcun, Qiaotou, Nanbei Jiacun, Zhangyuancun, and Sentaicun (all northeast of Jiexiu city). The Communist forces suffered heavy losses and fled in all directions.

### Hao County Recaptured

Zhang Taisheng's Troops Routed

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] A certain division of the National Army recaptured Hao County on the afternoon of the 3rd.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] The National Army in eastern Henan advanced towards Luyi along the Shizi River, 15 kilometers south of Hao County, on the 13th. The 5,000-strong Communist force under Zhang Taisheng has been routed. There are no more Communist forces harassing the Xia邑 and Yongcheng areas. The National Army in the Shangqiu and Minquan areas of eastern Henan is carrying out mopping-up operations along both sides of the railway, and has captured many prisoners in recent days.

[Our Hefei Dispatch, 13th] There are no regular Communist troops in Hao County. They are all mixed units. The Communist Brigade Headquarters is stationed at Wanglou, southwest of the city. An independent Communist regiment of about 600 people is stationed four li west of the city. The 36th Communist Regiment is stationed on the north bank of the He River. In total, there are more than 2,000 people with guns. They have been forcing civilians to demolish the city walls in recent days.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 12th] A dispatch from the East China Sea says that Hao Pengju's troops, currently stationed in the Haishu and S鲁 border areas, still number more than 10,000 and are doing much to maintain local order. When the officers and soldiers of the unit heard that Hao had been [blank], the entire army was grieved and angry, and vowed to continue to pledge allegiance to the government and avenge Hao. Relevant parties here have received a telegram from the officers and soldiers of the army.

### No Change on the Front Line at Pulandian; Soviet Troops Outside the Agreement Line Still Have Not Withdrawn; Sun Liren Flies Back to Changchun After Meeting Du Yuming in Shenyang

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 13th] There is no change on the front line at Pulandian. The Soviet troops stationed north of the Quan River, beyond the agreement line, have not withdrawn. Communist forces south of Pulandian are busy building fortifications. It is also reported that Communist forces are frequently transporting goods by sea between Dalian and Yantai, apparently stepping up the transport of supplies, and possibly transporting large quantities of ammunition to supply the Communist forces fighting in southern Shandong.

### US Personnel of the Military Mediation Department Can Be Completely Withdrawn Within Two Months; Rumor That US Military Advisory Group Will Set Up a Branch Group in Beiping is Incorrect

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Connors, a spokesperson for the US Embassy, told reporters today that the rumor that the US Military Advisory Group plans to set up a branch group in Beiping is incorrect. Most of the US personnel of the Military Mediation Department will be withdrawn completely within about 60 days, starting from mid-February. After the withdrawal of the US personnel, the Military Mediation Department will retain 25 officers and soldiers to be responsible for clearing up the remaining assets and managing the housing, etc. During this period, they will administratively belong to the US Military Advisory Group, but this does not mean that the US Military Advisory Group will set up a branch group in Beiping. The spokesperson also said that General Rooks, head of the US Military Advisory Group, is going to Beiping, or will discuss with the US authorities of the Military Mediation Department the matter of mutual transfer of personnel. General Rooks may transfer some personnel from the Military Mediation Department due to work needs, but this is only a mutual transfer in nature, and the personnel of the US Military Advisory Group will not increase. Some of the personnel currently holding positions in the US Military Advisory Group who have exceeded the three-year overseas service limit will be replaced by personnel from the Military Mediation Department.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The tripartite personnel of the Military Mediation Department are busy withdrawing and ending their work. The government is working hard to take care of the withdrawal of the Communist and US parties, and to resettle all the staff. They are still working as usual every day. Today, more than 60 military police officers, transferred from Chongqing and other places when the Military Mediation Department was established last year, returned to the capital on three US planes of the Military Mediation Department. This is the first batch of personnel to return to the capital after the dissolution of the Military Mediation Department. Twenty officers transferred from the Northeast Headquarters and ten from the Beiping Headquarters will be transferred back to their original agencies. Chen Hu, director of the Government Mediation Office of the Military Mediation Department, will remain in Beiping to take up the new post of chief of staff of the Beiping Garrison Command. General Cai Wenzhi, the government's deputy commissioner, will only be able to return to the capital in mid-March, after the withdrawal of the Communist and US personnel.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The Taiyuan (Third) and Linfen (Fourteenth) groups of the Military Mediation Department were picked up by US planes this afternoon and returned to Beiping. The Seventh and Thirteenth groups stationed in Jinan are scheduled to be withdrawn to Beiping tomorrow. Tang Chaoxian, a warrant officer from the government side of the department, and 15 others are also scheduled to return to the capital on a US plane tomorrow. Most of the Communist personnel have stopped working, and those who have withdrawn account for about a quarter of the total number. Today, one plane transported Communist supplies to Yan'an, and Wu Youbiao and more than ten others will be sent away tomorrow. The US withdrawal work in Harbin is the most active. Six US ships will come to Tanggu on the 17th, possibly carrying most of the personnel back to their country.

[United Press, Beiping, 13th] Zhang, the secretary of the Eleventh War Zone, said that the US withdrawal from Beiping and the dissolution of the Military Mediation Department will not affect the security of Beiping. Li Zongren, director of the headquarters, will issue a statement in the coming days to avoid panic among students due to the rumors that free-thinkers will be arrested after the Military Mediation Department withdraws.

### Our Surplus Salt Export Policy is Based on Production, Mainly to Take Care of Domestic Needs; Exports Will Be Made When There is a Surplus, and the Quantity is Not Limited

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Recently, the industrial sector has expressed concerns about whether China's surplus salt should be exported to Japan. This reporter has learned from relevant parties that since the victory, all salt-producing areas in China have been recovered. It is estimated that the annual production may reach a huge 160.6 million dan. Together with the original stock of about 48.8 million dan, the total is 154.4 million dan. In addition to supplying domestic sales, there is still a minimum surplus of 60 to 70 million [blank], which cannot be disposed of. Therefore, we have to try to reduce production on the one hand, gradually cutting down salt fields that are not economically viable, and at the same time seek a way out for the excess salt. The Allied Headquarters in Tokyo requested that our country's surplus salt be exported to Japan in exchange for materials. After careful consideration, the decision was made to accept it, for three reasons: (1) Exporting salt that has no use domestically to foreign countries not only provides a way out for surplus salt, but can also be exchanged for materials needed domestically, enriching national use; (2) Relieving salt farmers of economic hardship and unemployment, avoiding serious social problems; (3) Avoiding salt farmers from smuggling in large quantities, hindering tax revenue.

The total export quantity last year (1946) was 289,935.5 tons. This year, the initial export plan was formulated based on the salt inventory at the end of 1946, plus the possible surplus of new salt produced this year, totaling 785,000 tons for the whole year. The export is projected to be 376,000 tons for the first half of the year, from January to June. Considering the past export situation of our country, this number is not too far apart.

According to [blank] political authorities: We sincerely hope that the chemical industry in various countries will have considerable development, and can voluntarily make full use of the surplus salt, but at present, the industrial sector in fact cannot accept this surplus salt, so we have to allocate exports. This is really not an easy thing to do. The current export policy is based on taking care of our own country first, and then exporting when there is a surplus. The quantity is not limited. The amount of production and revenue this year is not as much as expected. At that time, we will allocate the quantity according to the supply and demand situation, and change the export plan. We will never let the export affect the domestic food demand.

Fujian Salt to be Shipped to Japan Within the Week

### Lushan Land to be Nationalized; Jiangxi Administrative Committee Decides on Measures

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 12th] Lushan land was originally acquired with lease rights by Chinese and foreign people. Now, in order to promote the land policy, Wu Shih-han, director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, specially proposed at the Jiangxi Administrative Conference that the method of nationalizing the land in Qingdao City should be followed, the lease rights should be cancelled, and a limited-term lease should be re-established. The proposal was resolved by the conference: (1) All land in Lushan, regardless of whether it is held by Chinese or foreign people, and those holding water lease certificates, must be cancelled and a limited-term lease will be issued separately; (2) If limited by treaty, the matter should be submitted to the diplomatic authorities to negotiate with the countries concerned to sign a new treaty, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan by the provincial government for approval.

### UNRRA Rushes to Ship Supplies to China; The First Batch of Locomotives May Arrive in Kowloon Next Month

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] With UNRRA's relief work in Europe coming to an end, the relief work for China is also becoming intense. The United States is now shipping a large number of relief supplies to China. More than 100 ships are rushing to transport supplies to China, and from now on, an average of 12 ships per week will unload 36,000 tons of supplies at ports such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Dagu.

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] UNRRA has now shipped its first batch of 160 locomotives and coal water cars allocated to China. Forty-seven of them were loaded onto the Norwegian 10,000-ton merchant ship Bai Zhen on the 11th. The ship is expected to leave the United States on February 20 and is expected to arrive in Kowloon on March 15. These vehicles will be unloaded directly to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Chen Zhimai, a counselor at the Chinese Embassy in the United States, said here that the departure of the vehicles to China is a significant event, as the Chinese government has always attached great importance to the supply of transportation tools. Rooks, the new director of UNRRA, said that UNRRA is very willing to help China revive its transportation. Half of UNRRA's plan to revive China's transportation is to revive China's railways, which includes allocating 242 locomotives, 3,000 freight cars, 400,000 tons of bridge materials, and 100 tons of rail materials, and all its ancillary equipment to China. The materials allocated to our country by UNRRA will be shipped to China successively at one-month intervals. After that, the materials will be unloaded in Shanghai instead of Kowloon. In addition to the 160 locomotives originally scheduled to be allocated to China, UNRRA is also manufacturing 50 locomotives in Australia and allocating them to China. This batch of locomotives is expected to be shipped to China in the summer of this year.

### Austrian Employee of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA) Killed in Tong County

[Reuters, Tianjin, 13th] Weisburg, an Austrian supervisor of the highway transportation team of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA), was traveling from Tong County to Ping on Tuesday afternoon at 4 p.m. with several UNRRA supply trucks. In a village 20 miles east of Tong County, they were stopped by four Chinese men: two wearing blue uniforms, one wearing a gray uniform, and one wearing plain clothes. The Chinese man in plain clothes ordered Weisburg to get out of his yellow truck. Weisburg, wearing an UNRRA uniform, raised his hands and obeyed the order to get out of the truck. The Chinese man in plain clothes, without saying a word, raised his gun and opened fire on him. Weisburg was shot and fell to the ground, rolling down a slope ten steps away, screaming miserably. The Chinese driver took the opportunity to escape and saw a soldier throw a hand grenade at Weisburg again. The Chinese driver finally arrived in Beiping. Later, another commercial truck passed the scene and saw Weisburg lying on the ground, his coat and shoes had been taken off. The truck did not dare to rescue him. It is reported that although the people who stopped the UNRRA truck team searched the truck, they did not take any items. They are not usually a gang of bandits.

### More Than 100,000 Refugees in Vietnam Awaiting Aid; Overseas Chinese Delegation Reports to Reporters in Beijing; Countless Deaths, Injuries, and Property Losses

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Luo Weiji, Zhou Shouyu, and other representatives of the Overseas Chinese Rehabilitation Committee in Vietnam, hosted a press conference at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th to report on the losses suffered by overseas Chinese and their experiences of being trapped during the French-Vietnamese conflict. Zhou Shouyu reported that when the French-Vietnamese war in Haiphong was taking place, the Viet Minh army used the shops and residences of our overseas Chinese as trenches, resisting house by house. The French army then launched a fierce attack on the Viet Minh army, causing heavy losses to our overseas Chinese compatriots. According to statistics, the total loss of houses and property is no less than 40 million Vietnamese currency. The number of missing people is 321 men and 261 women. The number of arrested people is 161 men and 37 women. The number of injured people is 39 men and 17 women. The number of deaths is 41 men and 26 women, totaling 902 people. About 1,000 people have not reported and their entire families have died or scattered. The numbers are really not small. When the peace negotiations in Haiphong failed on December 19th and the war in Vietnam broke out in full force, the war broke out successively in Lang Son, Hanoi, Nam Dinh, Kanghai, Beining, Beijiang, Thuan Hoa, Yian, Da Nang, and Xianan. The deaths and losses of overseas Chinese were even greater. At present, no less than 100,000 of our overseas Chinese compatriots are scattered in various parts of northern Vietnam. Those who are displaced and impoverished are everywhere. Now that the war is in full swing, there are still more than 10,000 overseas Chinese compatriots trapped in the overseas Chinese area controlled by the Viet Minh army in Hanoi. Food is [blank], there is no water at all, and they are sitting and waiting to die. Epidemics are occurring, and there are deaths from time to time. The Hanoi Chinese Association and the Chinese School are housing more than 3,800 refugees, crying for food. The Nading Guanghua School and the Nantian Hotel were bombed by the French army, killing and injuring more than 100 people. The shops and residences of overseas Chinese in Beining were completely destroyed by artillery fire. We hereby request the government to (1) demand compensation from both the French and Vietnamese sides for the losses of overseas Chinese; (2) take effective measures to protect overseas Chinese; and (3) send personnel with funds to provide relief. We hope that compatriots across the country will give spiritual and material assistance to the 100,000 refugees in northern Vietnam.

### Three Major Tasks Underway for Yellow River Mouth Closure and Embankment Restoration Relief: River Diversion expected to be Completed by End of Next Month

[Our City News] Through consultations among the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA), Water Conservancy Commission and the Chinese Communist Party, it appears that opinions have become slightly closer regarding the solution to the Yellow River problem. The implementation of the three major tasks of mouth closure, embankment restoration and relief is now agreed upon by the four parties to proceed simultaneously and separately. The Yellow River has ice floods in the second spring, and peach floods in April. According to forecasts, if the project is expedited, there will be no disaster, but there will be a large flood in July this summer. If the mouth closure project cannot be completed before July, the flooding is worrying, and it will be out of control once it starts. Therefore, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA), Water Conservancy Commission and the Chinese Communist Party have all agreed to expedite the Yellow River project. As for the funds for relieving the refugees in the disaster area, they will be allocated by the government.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 12th] The Huayuankou mouth closure project has been extremely smooth in the past week. It has been decided to open three more river diversion channels, which have already begun construction. It is estimated that the channels will be joined by the end of March. The entire volume of the Yellow River water will arrive in Shandong Province in mid-April. At present, most of the embankment restoration project in the Guojun [blank] area of Shandong Province has been completed. All the dangerous works and repairs below the middle and foreign positions have been completed. The work of repairing the parts above the middle water level is now continuing.

### Industrial Machinery Removed from the Northeast Valued at $900 Million USD; Inoperable Factory Equipment Estimated at Around $2 Billion USD

[United Press, Washington, 13th] American Reparations Commissioner Edwin W. Pauley reiterated today regarding the "industrial machinery removed by the Soviet Union from the Northeast," stating: The utility of the machinery after it was transported to the Soviet Union is minimal, but if it had been left for China, it would have been of great value.

Pauley stated: He is certain that the value of the machinery removed by the Soviet Union is $900 million USD, but the factory equipment rendered inoperable due to the removal is estimated to be around $2 billion USD. Therefore, the Soviet side's claim that the value of the machinery they removed is $1 billion USD is not unreasonable.

### Original Text of the Judgment Reasons Against Traitor Ding Mocun

— Continued to completion

Opportunistic Maneuvering

Regarding the favorable facts presented by the defendant, there are four categories: (1) Voluntary Surrender: The defendant claims that in the spring of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], he entrusted someone to surrender to the central government, demonstrating his remorse and intent to perform meritorious service. However, the defendant was already wanted by the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office as of October 2, 1939. He did not voluntarily surrender for trial before the crime was discovered. Therefore, he clearly does not meet the conditions for voluntary surrender stipulated in Article 62 of the Criminal Code, nor does he meet the primary requirements for voluntary surrender stipulated in Article 1 of the regulations on traitors surrendering. The defendant's claim of voluntary surrender is therefore not worthy of discussion. (2) Assisting the War of Resistance: The defendant claims that after surrendering, he set up a concealed radio station, secretly reported enemy intelligence, opposed "Clearance Campaigns," opposed participation in the war, sowed discord between the enemy and Wang [Jingwei], sabotaged Li Shiqun and "76," spread pro-war sentiment, sabotaged the enemy's plundering of resources, organized the Zhengfeng Society, absorbed remorseful elements, used strategies to persuade enemy troops to withdraw, requested changes to ciphers, revoked the Zhejiang blockade line, controlled puppet troops to prepare for reaction, rescued underground workers of the central government, suggested a general amnesty to release political prisoners already sentenced, and developed party affairs and culture in the occupied areas. After investigation of the evidence provided by the defendant, those deemed necessary to investigate have been carefully reviewed, such as the concealed radio station, organizing the Zhengfeng Society, providing intelligence, and rescuing underground workers. There is a confidential letter No. 81 from the Organization Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party dated December 10, 1946, letters from Jiang Bocheng and Wu Kaixian dated December 9 and 4 of the same year, and case files sent by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the former Military Affairs Commission, which can be used to determine their authenticity. However, although the defendant performed minor services, his crimes are heinous. Weighing the pros and cons, it is not enough to compensate for his crimes even in the slightest. Furthermore, according to the transfer documents from the former Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, in August 1943, the bureau approved the use of a radio station set up in Ding's private residence to communicate with us formally, but this matter was known to the enemy, who deliberately did not destroy it, wanting to use it as a so-called "bridge of peace" with our central government. It can be determined that this was not a sincere voluntary surrender (see page 36 of the bureau's files). The defendant's use of assisting the War of Resistance for opportunistic maneuvering is obvious and not sufficient for sentencing consideration.

Petty Favors

(3) Striving for the Welfare of the People in the Occupied Areas: The defendant claims that he founded the Social Enterprise Association and the Rural Welfare Association in his private capacity, establishing welfare enterprises in various places. The expenses were privately raised and donated by the defendant, alleviating the suffering of the people and preserving the vitality of the country. A list of the enterprises he operated is on file. The social enterprises operated by the defendant were mostly the responsibilities of the pseudo-Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Social Welfare. The defendant held pseudo-official positions as minister of these ministries for many years. Even if the listed enterprises are genuine, they are the obligations that he should have fulfilled in his pseudo-official position and are difficult to consider as actions beneficial to the people. Furthermore, reviewing the list of enterprises operated, they are merely petty favors, used to win over people's hearts so that they would be driven by the enemy and puppets, and are difficult to use as a reason for reducing the sentence. (4) Assisting in the Surrender and Preserving Local Areas: The defendant claims that after the victory, he was ordered to assist the central government in accepting the surrender, acting as a liaison with the enemy's commander-in-chief, and also acting as a liaison for the surrender of the Zhejiang puppet troops to the Third War Area. He also assisted the Third War Area in receiving enemy military equipment, materials, and defensive positions. He was previously appointed as a military commissioner of the Zhejiang region of the former Military Affairs Commission, maintaining security in Zhejiang. Later, he handed over all the puppet military security teams, which were received by the central government, with no one or a single gun lost. The defendant's assistance in the surrender and preservation of local areas is proven to be true by a confidential letter No. 11 from the Army General Headquarters dated October 30, 1946. However, these actions all occurred after the victory and do not meet the conditions of "having assisted the War of Resistance and taken actions beneficial to the people" stipulated in Article 3 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, and cannot be used as a basis for reducing the sentence. Even if his attitude after the crime was slightly constructive, it was merely because he was at his wit's end and had no choice but to submit. It is difficult to adopt this as a standard for discretionary sentencing.

Unforgivable by Law

The defendant, having received higher education and held important positions in the central government, deserted his post to participate in the war at a time of deep enemy incursions and critical war conditions, abandoned the anti-Japanese camp, secretly communicated with the enemy, willingly joined the rebellion, ambushed central judicial personnel, harmed underground working comrades, and published pro-Japanese fallacies, confusing public opinion, exploiting people's wealth, and supplying the enemy. His crimes are so obvious that he is truly unforgivable by law. He should be sentenced to the maximum penalty, deprived of his civil rights for life, to uphold the national law and rectify the hearts of the people. All of his property, except for a reasonable amount reserved for the necessary living expenses of his family, should be confiscated. Based on the above arguments, the special criminal procedure law Article 291, the first article of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Article 2, paragraph 1, item 1, Article 8, paragraph 1, Article 9, the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Criminal Code, Article 28, and Article 37, paragraph 1, are used to render the judgment as stated in the main text. Prosecutor Chen Sheng served as prosecutor in this case. February 8, 1947, First Criminal Division of the Capital High Court, Presiding Judge Jin Shiding, Judge Ge Zhaotang, Judge Shentu Chen. (End)

Editorial

### How Should We Deal with the Current Economic Difficulties?

The recent surge in gold and banknotes that swept across major cities nationwide has subsided due to the government's strict measures. However, the root causes of China's economic crisis remain and could reemerge at any time. This is a current concern not only for the entire nation but also for friendly nations. If we do not find a way to stem the tide before it collapses, future financial turmoil will be endless and will intensify. Now that this turmoil has subsided, and after painful reflection, we feel the government must quickly re-establish a new economic policy. During the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 12th, the members unanimously agreed that the current economic policy needs to be re-evaluated. Therefore, they decided to establish an economic policy research committee, composed of Central Committee members, prominent figures from industry and commerce, and economic experts, to be responsible for researching economic policy. This proves that the government also believes that the current economic policy needs to be changed.

China's internal problems have become increasingly complex and are no longer a single, simple issue. The New York Times wrote on the 12th, commenting on the situation in China, "China's financial crisis is the root of China's political problems." Therefore, it advocates starting with rescuing the financial crisis to seek a solution to political problems. This view seems reasonable on the surface, but in reality, it is not entirely accurate and reverses cause and effect. The real reason for China's financial crisis is not inflation or the "government's declining popularity," but the unresolved issue of the Communist Party. China is a country that lags behind in every aspect. After eight years of arduous war, the loss of human and material resources, even calculated in astronomical figures, is not enough to represent the one-ten-thousandth of the losses our country has suffered. Moreover, after the victory of the War of Resistance, without time to recuperate, it suffered from the destruction and devastation of the Chinese Communist Party. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, there has never been a day of peace in the country, and restoration cannot even be discussed. How can we talk about revival! Therefore, as long as the problem of the Chinese Communist Party is not resolved, there is no possibility of eliminating China's financial crisis.

The Chinese Communist Party not only holds a gloating attitude towards this surge in gold and banknotes, with a feeling of "watching the fire from across the river, clapping and cheering," but also feels complacent, believing that the great success of the Chinese Communist Party's disruption of financial policy is about to achieve their goal of "total collapse," which they have been hoping for day and night. This newspaper pointed out the political factors in the financial turmoil long ago. Judging from the statement issued by Special Envoy Marshall when he left China to return to the United States to take office as Secretary of State, Marshall frankly pointed out in his statement the Chinese Communist Party's conspiracy to use war to promote the domestic economic collapse, thereby achieving its goal of seizing power. It can be seen that as long as the internal turmoil does not stop for a day, China's economy has no possibility of improving for a day. I remember that in late last month, giants in Shanghai's industry, commerce, culture, and education circles, in view of the difficult domestic economic situation, also issued a call for peace, demanding an immediate ceasefire on the spot. In their declaration, there were several painful and heartbreaking words: "The people of the whole country are about to starve to death. Due to the war, thousands and thousands of compatriots continue to be abandoned in ditches and gullies. Due to the war, transportation is blocked, currency continues to inflate, people are unemployed, and industry and commerce are bankrupt. Therefore, we cannot but painfully issue a call from our conscience, demanding an end to the war and demanding the restoration of peace." However, the Chinese Communist Party, upon hearing the painful cries of the people, not only did not feel the slightest sympathy but instead felt complacent, celebrating the great success of its disruptive policies. Therefore, not only can the internal turmoil not be stopped, but it can only be expanded. Then, the Chinese Communist Party intensified its offensives in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, making the people even more tearless.

With the Chinese Communist Party doing its best to destroy it, how can China's economy embark on the road to revival? However, we believe that the Chinese nation is a great and strong nation, with an unshakable belief in "human determination overcoming heaven." The more difficult the environment, the more the people know how to struggle arduously. As long as the government has good policies, a major determination, and a systematic plan, any economic difficulties can be overcome one by one. Therefore, when the government re-discusses economic policy, we are willing to put forward several opinions for the reference of the people of the country.

First, we believe that internal turmoil is the only root cause of economic difficulties, which is the main cause of financial turmoil. We, the ordinary people, are the masters of the country and cannot allow the Chinese Communist Party to arbitrarily manipulate the fate of the country and our own destiny. We should all stand up and strive for peace for the nation, the country, and ourselves. Although individual strength is limited, everyone should participate in the peace movement initiated by the Shanghai business community. This peace movement will generate strength. No matter how dictatorial the Chinese Communist Party is, turning a deaf ear to the cries of the people, public opinion cannot be insulted, and the Chinese Communist Party will ultimately have to be cautious! If the Chinese Communist Party insists on going its own way, then the so-called "the unjust have little support," which is tantamount to cutting themselves off from the people, and doing many unjust acts will inevitably lead to their own destruction. Therefore, after this turmoil, we, the ordinary people, should rise up to strive for peace and seek a way to save ourselves.

Second, to save the economic difficulties, it is necessary to have good policies, but stopping at policies alone will not be effective. We observe the common problem in today's Chinese politics, which lies in "no statistics" and "no plan." Taking this gold and banknote turmoil as an example, the insane speculators, disregarding the lives and deaths of the people, only seek personal gain and push up the price of gold and banknotes, which is the main cause of this turmoil. However, the financial authorities' lack of planning and lack of statistics is also one of the reasons for fueling the turmoil. Because before and after the Lunar New Year, issuing huge amounts of customs gold is tantamount to giving speculators a good opportunity to take advantage of the reason for currency inflation to stir up trouble in the market. This is something that everyone can anticipate. However, the financial authorities were unprepared beforehand, and after the turmoil occurred, they were at a loss, allowing it to spread and expand, so that the market became crazy and even more out of control. Later, strict measures were taken, which could suppress the rising price of gold and banknotes, but it is very difficult to suppress the prices of goods that rose in response. We assume that the financial authorities have accurate statistics, understand the details of the Shanghai market, and fight against the speculators who are pushing up the price of gold with the strength of the national treasury. We do not believe that this gold and banknote turmoil could not have been avoided. Learning from the past is a guide for the future. We hope that the financial authorities can accept this lesson, change their past practices, and have a plan for everything and statistics for everything. The effectiveness of France in suppressing prices and the success of the British rationing system rely on the authorities in charge having statistics, plans, and determination.

Third, according to a United Press Nanjing dispatch, the government's basis for resolving domestic economic difficulties within three months is entirely based on American surplus materials and Japanese reparations. We do not believe that the agency's dispatch is correct, but there are also some people in the country who hold this dependent mentality. We believe that this dependency is the most terrible thing and must point out that this is definitely not the way out for China's economy. The way to manage finances is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. In terms of increasing revenue, the first is to increase production, facilitate transportation, and promote industry and commerce. In terms of reducing expenditure, not only should the government save on government expenses, but also the people should tighten their belts and reduce their consumption. The current difficult situation is caused by the fact that domestic production is small and consumption is large, which led to this situation.

In short, the current economic policy needs to be re-evaluated. At the same time, in order to cope with the current economic difficulties, the government should have plans, statistics, and determination in handling anything. As for the people of the whole country, at this time when the domestic economic difficulties are most serious, they should tighten their belts and reduce their consumption, and work together to overcome the difficulties.

### Mudu Grain Hoarding Case Involves the Field Grain Sub-Bureau; Rice Merchants to be Summoned Tomorrow

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 13th] In the Mudu rice merchants' grain hoarding case, the county military law office has summoned the responsible persons of each rice shop to report to the authorities for interrogation on the 15th. The director of the Mudu Field Grain Sub-Bureau, Dong Yixian, suddenly submitted his resignation, which was not approved. Our reporter specially visited County Chief Shen again, who said that the current investigation work can be divided into two steps: (1) According to the rice shops, part of the grain stored under seal is deposited by the Field Grain Sub-Bureau. Therefore, it is necessary to first investigate why the grain tax collected by the Field Grain Sub-Bureau was not turned over to the warehouse but stored in commercial rice shops. (2) The amount of grain hoarded by the rice merchants will be converted into dan and shi by measuring the volume and checking the accounts to see if there is any discrepancy. As for the handling of this case, the decision on the hoarded grain is to sell it at a fair price in principle.

### Yixing to Huzhou Commuter Train

### Driver Disregards Passenger Safety; Rugao-Nantong Highway Truck Falls into River; Company Ignores Casualties; Stranded Passengers Appeal

[Nantong Dispatch] On the morning of January 31, a ten-wheeled truck No. 10 of the Nantong Northern Jiangsu Water and Land Joint Company, carrying more than ten passengers including Chu Long, and more than thirty pigs, drove from Rugao to Nantong. At Yangzhuang between Shizhuang and Guojiayuan, Li Zhaonan and eight others and several other passengers boarded the truck. When it reached Pingchao, it was already sunset. The passengers initially assumed that the truck would drive directly to Nantong, but when it reached the fork between Tangjia Gate and Chenggang, the passengers wanted to go to Nantong first, but the driver did not listen, did not stop, and drove directly to Tianshenggang. It arrived at the port at 7:00 PM and began unloading the pigs. The driver immediately notified Chu Long to extort 25,000 yuan per passenger from Li Zhaonan and the others: (According to the price of a ticket from Rugao to Tong on that day, the price per passenger was only 20,000 yuan). After a delay of about half an hour, the passengers were able to board the truck. After turning around at the gate, the truck started driving. The headlights could not illuminate. In a moment, at the eastern turn of the Zesheng Sluice Company, it veered and plunged into the water (according to the turn, the surface is twice as wide as the highway). The water was so deep that the truck could not be seen. Residents and police rushed to rescue. Yao Naiwen, Li Zhaonan, and Li Yaochen died despite rescue efforts. Nearly twenty other people were rescued and resuscitated. Two more bodies, Chu Long and Kong Cai, were recovered the next day. Looking at the above situation, the fact that the truck's headlights could not illuminate was the cause of the accident. However, the fact that the truck only cared about sending the pigs to Tianshenggang first, regardless of the safety of more than twenty passengers to Nantong, and drove directly to Tianshenggang without stopping at Tangzha in order to carry out its conspiracy to extort fares, is even more important to ignore. After the accident, the company only cared about salvaging its truck and continued to operate as usual, without asking about the dead, injured, or those who suffered losses. This is even more disheartening. The stranded passengers have now organized a union to discuss countermeasures and appeal for support from all sectors.

### Chongming Rent Dispute; Landlords Extorting Rice

[Our Chongming Dispatch] In this county, rents were changed to be paid in rice during the occupied period due to the drastic depreciation of currency. Recently, some landlords in fort towns have attempted to increase the rent rice. For a flat of less than fifty square feet, they are demanding about five dou of rice per month. If the tenants do not agree, they falsely claim that they are for their own use and order them to move out. Hundreds of tenants in the whole town are unable to bear such extortion by the landlords at a time when rice prices are soaring and all industries are in recession. They have organized a tenant union, preparing to rely on the Provincial Rent Relief Measures promulgated last autumn and citing the Minhang Rent Resolution Method disclosed by this newspaper on January 30 to negotiate with the landlords to reach a reasonable solution.

### Reorganizing Changxing Coal Mine, Zhejiang Construction Department Plans to Request Central Government Investment

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 13th] Zhejiang Province plans to establish brick and tile factories in Jiaxing. Each factory can accommodate 300 kilns. Developing the Changxing Coal Mine for fuel has become a priority. It is suggested that Pi Yingchang, due to disagreements among the old and new shareholders of the mine, has delayed its handling until now, so the Zhejiang General Office also cannot assist. Therefore, it is proposed to request investment from relevant central government agencies to invest as government shares and find ways to develop the mine.

### Pinghu Reorganizes Land Registry, Urging Residents to Register Door-to-Door

[Our Newspaper, Pinghu News] The County Land Registry Reorganization Office has been handling land registration in urban areas, Donghu, Shengtang, and Qiyuan townships for several months. However, the office recognizes that most landowners are unaware of the significance and are taking a wait-and-see approach. According to Article 57 of the Land Law, those who have not applied for registration after the deadline for general land registration should be considered unclaimed land and publicly announced. This is a serious matter concerning the gain or loss of people's property rights. To safeguard the rights of landowners, the office has dispatched personnel to urge residents to register door-to-door.

### Do Not Stereotype Firefighters

Regarding the major fire on Wuding Road on the night of January 22nd, opinions are divided and no consensus has been reached. Some say that firefighters extorted gold bars and haggled over prices, some say that firefighters stood by and watched without rescuing, some say that firefighters took advantage of the fire to loot and steal property, and some say that all firefighters were derelict in their duties, attacking indiscriminately and blurring the lines, affecting the entire fire service. This is truly not a minor matter. The fire service is a public organization that protects the safety of citizens, so criticism should separate the matter from the person. Even if a few individuals are bad, the principle should be to avoid harming the entire reputation and career. Crimes can be handled by law, and dereliction of duty can be replaced, but the entire city of Shanghai cannot guarantee that there will be no fires for a day, and there cannot be a day without firefighters to put out fires. It can be seen that the fire service cannot be abandoned for a day. In order for firefighters to be loyal to their duties, all citizens should cherish and encourage them. Unexpectedly, in this Wuding Road fire case, a few people nitpicked and attacked excessively, causing the entire organization to lose morale and all firefighters to become disheartened. This is a loss for society, not just a problem for a few individuals. Now, the minds of all citizens are suspicious that firefighters are petty thieves who steal property. If this continues, not only will firefighters on duty be unwilling to do work that has a bad reputation and is looked down upon, but everyone will be preparing to pack their bags. Even future firefighters will probably not be willing to take over the work of being regarded as thieves.

In the current stage, the work of firefighters is indeed very difficult. Every time they put out a fire, entering the burning building makes them suspected of theft, and not entering the burning building will result in disciplinary action for dereliction of duty. In this way, firefighters feel that they are in a dilemma and cannot perform their duties. I believe that if firefighters do have illegal behavior, they should be severely punished to rectify the evil trend, but it must be based on facts. Empty words should not be used to accuse people, and people should not be wrongly accused. It is unacceptable to call a deer a horse and implicate the innocent, causing all firefighters to feel chilled.

Furthermore, regarding the issue of responsibility, the firefighter's responsibility is to put out the fire. Watching over the property of disaster victims is not their responsibility. The loss of disaster victims is one thing, and whether firefighters have stolen is another. If the loss of disaster victims is attributed to the firefighters, it would be too harsh.

As for the government's handling of the Wuding Road fire case, it can be said to be cautious and deliberate. The five-person investigation committee is also very detailed and strict in its investigation work. All those who entered the burning building have been transferred to the prosecutor's office for interrogation (see the investigation report). Since the authorities are determined to get to the bottom of this case and are willing to sacrifice their subordinates to gain the sympathy of society, more than 20 officials and police officers who entered the burning building, whether they were acting in the public or private interest, may be summoned or detained at any time, regardless of whether they were at fault or not. I hope that the disaster victims will have a clear conscience and quickly provide clear evidence and do not be ambiguous any more. If firefighters know of any misconduct, they should voluntarily report it so that the scum can be removed and the good can be protected. It is hoped that the law enforcement authorities will determine right from wrong and not involve the innocent. (Xiao Leyou)

### Please Dispose of Corpse of Child by Roadside Quickly

It has been found that there are several corpses (all children) wrapped in firewood piled by the roadside near Lake Hui Villa on Lvbanc Road in the Nanshi area. They have been left there for more than a month without being handled and are left to rot. At a time when smallpox is rampant in the city, these corpses may have died from smallpox or variola. The foul odor is steaming and there is a risk of infection. It is hoped that the authorities will dispose of them quickly. (Questioning Voice)

### Many Items for Fees Collected by Municipal Schools

I am a student at the Zhenru Municipal Middle School. On the 8th, I received a payment notice from the school, which left me stunned. There was a long list of items: tuition fees of 20,000 yuan for junior high school and 30,000 yuan for senior high school. Supplementary repair and replacement fees of 20,000 yuan for junior high school and 30,000 yuan for senior high school. Miscellaneous fees of 10,000 yuan, a compensation reserve of 5,000 yuan "temporarily collected." A subsidy fee of 60,000 yuan for academic advancement of teachers and staff, accommodation fee of 60,000 yuan, and food fee of 250,000 yuan. The most humorous of these items is the subsidy fee for academic advancement of teachers and staff. How is this different from a private school? The purpose of our applying to a municipal school is to save costs and reduce the burden on our families. Most of our parents are salary earners. This fee is not easy to pay. Especially for civil servants, who are known for being upright and poor, the same is true. If they have many children, where will they get the money for education? In the end, the only option is to withdraw from school with tears. Who has ruined our future? (Small Place, Big Issues)

### US and Canada Establish Military Agreement, Continuing Cooperation to Implement Peacetime Joint Defense

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 13th Broadcast: The United States and Canada announced today that the two countries will continue their wartime military cooperation in peacetime to ensure the security of North America.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The United States and Canada announced simultaneously today that the two countries have concluded a five-point military agreement to "encourage" standardization of equipment, training, and tactics, and to allow mutual use of army, navy, and air force facilities. The US State Department also stated that the military agreement concluded between the US and Canada and the exploratory talks held between the US and Britain on the same issue are two completely different matters. A State Department spokesman also said that the US-Canada agreement is a "document of understanding."

[Reuters, Ottawa, 12th] Canadian Prime Minister King stated in the House of Commons today that the United States has not requested military bases in northern Canada, and announced the following principles for the continuation of wartime cooperation between the United States and Canada in peacetime:

Six Principles, Mutual Understanding

(1) Exchange selected personnel to familiarize them with the national defense of both countries. (2) Engage in general cooperation in exercises, experiments, and research on matters of common interest to both countries, and exchange observers. (3) Encourage the joint design and standardization of weapons equipment, military organization, training methods, etc. (4) Mutual use of naval and air force facilities within the borders of both countries. (5) The cooperation between the two countries shall be based on the principle that it does not harm the control of each country over all activities within its own borders. Prime Minister King also said that the Arctic region is the shortest transportation line between North America and other major centers in the world, so its status has become increasingly important. For this reason, we must pay special attention to these regions. In other words, when considering Canada's defense, we should consider not only the east and west ends but also the north end. Prime Minister King finally stated that the United States and Canada will never take actions that are inconsistent with the UN Charter.

[United Press, Ottawa, 13th] Canada's announcement that the wartime defense cooperation agreement with the United States will continue in peacetime is a major step for the Dominion to gradually transition from the British Commonwealth to the North American sphere.

### Security Council Passes Resolution to Establish Disarmament Committee, Delineate Powers with Atomic Energy Committee, Draft Disarmament Resolution Pending Vote

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 13th Broadcast: The UN Security Council today passed a resolution by a vote of nine to zero to form a special committee to study various disarmament issues, except for those that have been discussed by the UN Atomic Energy Commission.

[United Press, Lake Success, New York, 12th] The UN Security Council passed a resolution this afternoon following the guidelines suggested by the United States to organize a UN Disarmament Committee composed of representatives from eleven countries, with the opposition of the Soviet Union being ineffective. The Disarmament Committee is limited to discussing the abolition of conventional weapons. All "weapons of mass destruction" will be handled by the established UN Atomic Energy Commission. The Security Council passed this proposal today by a vote of nine to zero, with the Soviet Union and Poland abstaining. No country opposed the Disarmament Committee itself, but the Soviet Union has consistently opposed distinctions in power when discussing disarmament issues and has been constantly arguing with the United States, thus delaying the discussion of disarmament issues for six weeks. As for the draft disarmament resolution submitted by the UN General Assembly to the Security Council for discussion, it is still pending a vote by the Security Council. The Security Council will now have to deal with the issue of the use of veto power by the five permanent members. If the Security Council believes that this matter is a matter of principle rather than procedure, the draft disarmament resolution may be "vetoed." However, representatives from Britain and the United States believe that Soviet representative Gromyko will not veto the disarmament plan simply because of his opposition to the distinction in power. According to today's resolution, the Security Council should establish a universal disarmament committee, composed of representatives from the eleven countries of the Security Council, including the five permanent members. The Disarmament Committee should submit to the Security Council recommendations for universal reduction of armaments and troops within three months, and effective guarantees to protect peace-loving countries from illegal military attacks. Today's resolution also stipulates that the Security Council should begin discussing the atomic energy issue raised by the Atomic Energy Commission as soon as possible. Representatives are scheduled to reconvene tomorrow at 3 p.m. to vote on the draft disarmament resolution.

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 12th] British representative Cadogan advised the Soviet Union during the disarmament debate in the Security Council today not to hinder the Security Council's Military Staff Committee any longer, so that the agreement on the UN motorcade issue discussed by the committee could be established quickly. Cadogan further suggested ordering the Military Staff Committee to submit a complete report by April 30. Cadogan also supported the US proposal, believing that the Disarmament Committee cannot interfere with the tasks of the Atomic Energy Commission. He also asked Soviet representative Gromyko whether the Soviet Union's opposition to this proposal was merely a formality, and if so, asked him to withdraw this opposition so that the Disarmament Committee could be appointed quickly. Representatives from France and Brazil also supported the US proposal.

### Einstein Supports Atomic Control

[Agence France-Presse, Princeton, New Jersey, USA, 12th] The great mathematician Einstein wrote to the Atomic Problem Research Association today, strongly urging the public to expand their awareness of the dangers of atomic warfare. He said, "Atomic energy has no place in the outdated narrow concept of nationalism, because atomic bombs cannot be defended. The only possible control is international understanding."

### Britain Assures US of Maintaining Close Cooperation

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Authoritative sources say that British Ambassador to the United States Lord Inverchapel has assured Secretary of State Marshall that the British government continues to advocate close cooperation with the United States as the basis for world peace and security. It has recently been rumored that British Foreign Secretary Bevin may become pro-Soviet due to pressure from left-wing members of the party, so both the public and private sectors in the United States feel unusually uneasy. The exchange of views between the British ambassador and Marshall is therefore highly valued by the general public.

### US Representative Selection Issue for UN Atomic Energy Commission

Many Oppose Lilienthal

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Lilienthal, appointed by President Truman as the US representative to the UN Atomic Energy Commission, has been criticized by the Senate committee investigating his resume. Extreme conservatives from the Republican Party and Democrats from the southern states have formed a united front to oppose him. Lilienthal has been accused of appeasing communism, and this issue has clearly become a major domestic political issue in the United States.

### Britain Recognizes Bulgarian Government, Hopes It Will Fulfill Treaty Obligations and Enjoy Rights

[Reuters, London, 12th] After signing a peace treaty with Bulgaria in Paris on Monday, Britain formally sent a note to the Bulgarian government, stating that the British government has decided to legally recognize the Bulgarian government. The note also stated the following: Although the British government recognizes the Bulgarian government, it continues to maintain its previous attitude that Britain believes that the Bulgarian interim government has failed to fulfill its promises to implement democratic rights. This recognition of the new Bulgarian government does not indicate that Britain recognizes that the methods used by the Bulgarian government in the election are consistent with the spirit and intent of the Yalta Declaration. The British government now feels that since Bulgaria has accepted the obligations stipulated in the peace treaty, it recognizes the Bulgarian government and hopes that it will fulfill its promises in the future so that all people under the jurisdiction of the government can enjoy basic rights. The Bulgarian government's reply, signed by Prime Minister Dimitrov, expressed satisfaction with the British government's formal recognition of the Bulgarian government and promised to fulfill the conditions of the peace treaty. However, it expressed disagreement with the points mentioned in the British note regarding the methods used by the Bulgarian government during the election.

### Treaty with Germany, Discussion Procedure, Adopts British and Soviet Drafts

In addition, the Council of Foreign Ministers decided to submit the notes sent by the governments of Italy and Syria requesting permission to send representatives to attend the meeting and state their opinions on the treaty with Germany to the Council of Foreign Ministers.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 13th Broadcast: When the Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the US proposal to set up a small-nation consultation committee, Soviet Foreign Minister Gusev announced that he would abandon his previous position in the four-power meeting and agreed to allow 18 small nations to participate in the drafting of the treaty with Germany.

### Egyptian Government Announces Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Invalid, Plans to File Complaint with UN

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 12th] The Egyptian government announced to the House of Representatives today that the government believes that the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 is invalid and will notify the United Nations organization of this matter.

[Reuters, Cairo, 13th] Former Egyptian Prime Minister El-Nokrashy suggested yesterday to resume the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations that had broken down last month and asked Saudi Arabian King Ibn Saud to mediate, but this was rejected by the committee appointed by the parliament to study the matter. Egyptian Minister of Commerce Batel said that the Egyptian government plans to file a complaint with the United Nations organization regarding Britain's attitude in the negotiations.

### American Military Leaders Protest Military Spending Cuts

[United Press International, Washington, December 12] Secretary of the Army Patterson informed Congress today that Chief of Staff Eisenhower and Supreme Commander of the Pacific Area MacArthur had told him that if the Republican Party intends to cut military spending, it will inevitably lead to unfortunate consequences. According to the budget proposal submitted by President Truman for this year, the Budget Committees of both houses voted yesterday to cut six billion US dollars, of which military spending was cut by one and a half billion US dollars. Some Republican members also expressed dissatisfaction with this, and government leaders unanimously denounced it, saying that the result of the budget cuts would undermine the US Army and Navy and leave the State Department without any support in negotiating a peace treaty with Germany. Patterson then spoke, saying that this move would put the occupying forces stationed in Germany and Japan in a dangerous situation in the event of a rebellion, as Germany and Japan might revolt if they are forced into famine. Patterson also said that in terms of the tasks completed by the occupying forces, the current funding and number of personnel have reached the minimum limit. It is also learned that at a closed-door meeting held by the House Military Affairs Committee today, several senior officials of the War Department proposed that if Congress passes universal military training, the War Department could agree to reduce the number of regular troops from 1.07 million to 875,000. Patterson and his staff also told the Military Affairs Committee that the War Department would also take into account the issue of being able to mobilize 68,000 National Guardsmen and 195,000 reservists in an emergency, and that with the continued implementation of the conscription plan, there would be a total of 5.5 million troops to deal with any contingencies.

### British Military Spending Increase

### Japanese Coalition Cabinet Plan: Five Political Parties in Negotiations

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, December 13] The meeting of the five Japanese parties adjourned this afternoon without reaching any resolution. Therefore, the question of whether the future Japanese cabinet will accommodate the Social Democratic Party and other smaller parties still needs to be decided tomorrow. After two hours of discussion, although the Social Democratic Party insisted on the resignation of Finance Minister Tanzan Ishibashi, forming a superficial deadlock, negotiations on a coalition government have made great progress. It is reported that the meeting held this afternoon by the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Cooperative Democratic Party, and the People's Party did not reach an agreement because the representatives of each party had to consult their respective party members before making a final decision. However, all parties have agreed to convene a second five-party meeting at 2 p.m. tomorrow after the opening ceremony of the parliament.

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, December 13] The plan to form a coalition cabinet centered on the Liberal, Progressive, and Social Democratic parties failed for the third time on the eve of the parliament's resumption. Finance Minister Ishibashi, Minister of Health Kawai, and Secretary-General of the Socialist Party Nishio and Mizutani from the Central Committee held talks this morning, followed by a meeting of the secretaries-general of the Liberal, Progressive, and Social Democratic parties in the afternoon, and then a meeting of the leaders of the Liberal, Progressive, Social Democratic, Cooperative Democratic, and People's parties. After several rounds of consultation on the formation of a coalition cabinet, the Social Democratic Party insisted on replacing Finance Minister Ishibashi, while the Liberal and Progressive parties opposed the replacement. As opinions could not be reconciled, the meeting ended without any results. The Social Democratic Party convened a central executive committee at 6 p.m. and decided to abandon the coalition efforts. Other parties also expressed pessimism about the coalition efforts.

Parliament Resumes Today

[United Press, Tokyo, December 13] The 92nd Japanese Diet opens tomorrow. Although several important bills will be submitted for discussion during the session, such as the budget for 1947-48, the Diet Law and the Election Law, and various laws related to labor and the economy, what Japanese politicians seem to be concerned about is whether the Supreme Commander's order for a general election and legislation will be carried out simultaneously in April. The Japanese people are quite indifferent to the speech that Prime Minister Yoshida intends to deliver at the opening of the Diet. It is expected that Yoshida will reiterate his old tune, asking the people to cooperate in seeking national revival and economic independence. The Liberal Party under Yoshida still maintains a majority in the Diet, enough to dismiss any motion of no confidence. According to some sources, the opposition Social Democratic Party is now considering a motion of no confidence against the Yoshida cabinet.

### US Interior Secretary Schedules Departure to Inspect Various Parts of the Pacific; Trip Related to Administrative Transfer Issues

He will be accompanied by Army and Navy officers and Interior Department officials such as Director Davison and Intelligence Director Skinner. The purpose of this trip is to consider changing the management of Guam, Samoa, and other Pacific islands from military control to the jurisdiction of the Interior Department. In addition, the United States plans to submit a draft trusteeship agreement on the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands to the Security Council on the 17th of this month.

### British Cabinet Establishes Emergency Committee to Deal with Fuel Crisis; Officials and Civilians Unite to Combat Severe Winter and Coal Shortage

[Our Newspaper] London, December 13 (Broadcast): Britain is still in a state of emergency today. British officials and civilians are fighting against the severe winter and coal shortage. Attlee personally leads his subordinates to participate in the work. The weather is clear, and hundreds of ships are sailing south to transport coal and fuel back to England to save the people from freezing and starvation. Troops in the Northwest and West have been dispatched to clear snow along railways and highways to facilitate coal transportation. Except for major industries, the use of electricity in all other areas has been uniformly suspended.

[Reuters, London, December 12] Prime Minister Attlee announced today the establishment of an emergency committee composed of cabinet members and representatives from the Central Coal Board, the Central Electricity Authority, and the Railway Executive Committee to deal with the coal crisis. After holding its first meeting today, the committee resolved the following emergency measures: (1) The method of cutting off electricity supply to household users for five hours a day will be expanded to the entire country, meaning that households, shops, and entertainment venues are prohibited from using electricity during the power outage period; (2) Those who violate the order will be subject to a fine of up to 500 pounds and imprisonment for up to two years; (3) The control measures for industrial electricity use will not be further expanded; (4) The fuel consumption of dog racing is completely prohibited. In addition, in order to ensure smooth coal transportation, it was resolved that: (1) Passenger train services may be suspended at any time when it is necessary to facilitate coal transportation; (2) All measures will be taken to facilitate the transportation of coal ships; (3) After consultation between the Ministry of Labor and trade unions, more workers will be hired to assist in unloading coal; (4) The Ministry of Transport will allocate trucks to transport coal from trains; (5) The Department of Fuel and Power has the right to requisition coal. The implementation of the blackout order has caused the unemployment of many workers. It is estimated that the number of unemployed people in the blackout area has reached 1.2 million.

### A Key Military Location in the Pacific: Micronesia Islands (Part 2) - Our Newspaper Reference Room

Future Disposal Methods

During World War II, the United States occupied many of these islands. After the end of the war, the United States considered these three groups of islands. Finally, US President Truman suggested placing the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific under the trusteeship of the United Nations, with the United States as the sole administrative authority. This means that the United States wants to obtain the management rights of the islands on behalf of Japan and wants to include Okinawa and Iwo Jima. However, trusteeship is different from mandate: (1) Under mandate, Japan was prohibited from establishing defenses, but in the proposed trusteeship, the United States has the right to establish military bases. (2) Under mandate, the stationing of troops was not allowed, but the US proposal allows for the stationing of troops and the taking of military action. (3) In the past, Japan did not comply with regulations and prohibited travel to the islands under mandate, but the US proposal allows for the signing of most-favored-nation treaties for member states of the United Nations. Furthermore, according to the UN Charter, the administrative power of the Trusteeship Council is extremely limited. The Security Council has the power to direct the Trusteeship Council to completely hand over political, economic, social, and educational matters within the so-called fortress area. In this view, trusteeship is only a part of military affairs.

Now that World War II has ended, international brewing is still extremely chaotic, and many people even worry that the next war is about to come. In this turbulent situation, the United States wants to obtain the special privilege of trusteeship of the islands, establish military bases on the islands, and prevent the UN Trusteeship Council from having the right to advise. Will this be discriminated against by other countries? This is the crux of the matter. Now the Soviet Union has responded, opposing the transfer of the islands by the UN Security Council to the United States for unilateral trusteeship, and declared that no final disposition can be made of this strategic area until the peace treaty with Japan is discussed.

The handling of these islands, which are related to the future security of the Pacific, will inevitably lead to a dispute. The security of the Pacific, of course, cannot be separated from the United States. In the past, because the United States missed the opportunity to acquire the islands, it encountered this great disaster. Japan used it as a tool to fight against Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and China. In the future, in order to maintain the security of the Pacific, the United States cannot easily give up. However, if the United States establishes military bases in the western Pacific, in the eyes of the Soviet Union, it will inevitably feel like a great threat.

However, how the islands will be handled still depends on the resolution in the peace conference. The principles and systems of the United Nations organization are the prerequisite for determining the fate of these islands. To maintain lasting world peace, everyone should cooperate openly and honestly and should never create a dark situation due to the conflict of interests between the two countries.

### Wallace Writes About Atomic Energy, Saying It Has Become an Open Secret

[Reuters, New York, December 12] Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace wrote in his edited "New Republic Magazine" that Britain, France, and a certain Scandinavian country are building atomic energy plants. Those who think that atomic energy can still be kept secret are probably only Americans. He said that France is recently building atomic decomposition machines, and a certain Scandinavian country has at least one atomic decomposition machine that can produce in years. The atomic energy plant that Britain is building can also manufacture atomic bombs, so the United States can no longer say that it intends to disclose atomic secrets only when other countries can be trusted. He advocated that the United States cooperate with other United Nations to establish a world security system, sincerely seek disarmament plans, and no longer use atomic secrets as a threat.

### Anglo-French Alliance Negotiations to Begin in Days

[Agence France-Presse, London, December 12] Regarding the conclusion of an alliance treaty between Britain and France, British officials recently stated that the two countries will begin negotiations in two or three days.

### London Conference at Impasse; Final Meeting Held Today

[United Press, London, December 12] Foreign Secretary Bevin said today in a speech to the Arab delegation that the solution to the Palestine issue is still far away. If the Jews and Arabs continue to reject the British government's solution, Britain may submit this issue to the United Nations organization. Bevin blamed the current impasse on both the Arab and Jewish sides and called on both sides to cooperate. It is said that if both sides can exercise sufficient statesmanship and actively seek a solution, it can increase their international prestige. The Labour Party opposes the 1939 White Paper, which restricts Jewish immigration to 1,500 per month. Britain feels that it has the complete right to amend this policy, and British troops cannot implement this restriction indefinitely. Earlier, Bevin listened to the Arab representatives explain the reasons for opposing the British plan. The Arab representatives strongly stated that Palestine should immediately declare undivided independence, stop the continued immigration of Jews, and fully protect Arab lands. Bevin promised to convey their opinions to the Cabinet and said that Britain's response would be presented at the final meeting on the 14th. Britain has no other plan besides the one that has been proposed.

### Chairman Sends Zheng Jiemin to Shanghai to Thoroughly Investigate the Inside Story of the Gold Rush

Songhu Garrison Commander Yi Tiewu told reporters yesterday: "The recent financial fluctuations, soaring prices, and public panic have filled the entire society with an atmosphere of unease, like a powder keg about to explode. It is the duty of this headquarters to maintain public order, and we cannot turn a blind eye to it. The rice shops have been closing their doors in recent days, but in reality, it is not that there is no rice to sell. It is purely that unscrupulous merchants are hoarding and speculating in order to seek huge profits. The manipulation and monopoly by a few people has caused panic in the lives of the majority of citizens. Their despicable behavior is extremely heartbreaking. I have ordered the Investigation Department and the Police Bureau to order all personnel to immediately conduct a widespread search of rice shops throughout the city. If rice is found, they will be ordered to open their doors and sell it under police supervision. The price will be based on the highest market price one week ago (about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan). Warehouses throughout the city are also subject to search. Currently, rice merchants are using the high gold price as an excuse to raise the price of rice. In reality, all the rice they have in stock was definitely not purchased when the price rose from 70,000 to 80,000 yuan to more than 100,000 yuan. This is not a period of shortage of rice, and there is absolutely no problem with the source of rice. Moreover, the government has a large amount of rice in hand and will supply it continuously. There is absolutely no shortage. The excuses of the rice merchants are completely unfounded. Chairman Jiang is extremely concerned about the soaring prices in this city, especially the financial fluctuations, which have a huge impact on the national economy. Therefore, he has specially sent Mr. Zheng Jiemin, Director of the First Department of the Military Command, to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation with me. We will conduct a thorough investigation into who is manipulating this gold rush, who are the people who are buying up large quantities at high prices, and where the purchased gold is being transported and stored. If it is found that there is any behavior that manipulates the gold price and disrupts the financial system, we will definitely deal with it severely, and we will definitely not use the usual methods to deal with it. The situation of the market chaos and soaring prices in this city is obviously not a naturally formed phenomenon, but the result of human action. Therefore, the government is determined to overcome it with human power, and speculative merchants will soon reap the consequences."

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeks to Stabilize Finance and Prices; Presents Four Emergency Proposals; Urges Immediate Re-establishment of Gold Policy

Suggestions on Adjusting Production and Sales, Stabilizing Livelihoods

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce held an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday. In order to suppress financial prices, it was decided to send a telegram to the government, outlining emergency treatment plans. The main content is that suggestions have been made on re-establishing the gold policy, implementing import and export linkage, grasping hands-on investment, rationing daily necessities, and increasing production and conserving consumption. It is believed that the current stage of gold policy really needs to be re-examined, and it is impossible to sit idly by and let nature take its course. It is believed that the government's use of gold in the future can only choose one of the following two points: (1) If the gold reserves are abundant, as the authorities have repeatedly stated, then it should immediately continue to sell off a large amount at a parity price, and at the same time issue physical warehouse coupons to absorb floating capital, which will be issued with gold principal and interest when they expire in two or three years. In order to target the people's psychology of protecting the value of the currency, it can allocate gold reserves and invite representatives of public opinion organs and industrial and financial groups to organize a "Gold Reserve Inspection Committee" to conduct public inspections on a regular basis to show the people faith. (2) Otherwise, the government should immediately announce the cessation of the current gold policy, thoroughly prohibit gold speculation, and decouple gold prices from prices. It is also believed that how to choose between the two must be decided quickly and cannot be delayed.

Implement Rationing to Control Prices

Regarding grasping materials and controlling prices, it is believed that the British rationing system can be followed to stabilize prices and stabilize wages. That is, the government purchases and stores various materials at home and abroad when necessary for the daily needs of the people. On the one hand, it implements a regular and quantitative rationing system for materials that have been grasped, such as rice, kerosene, and cotton cloth. The method must be fair, and the period must be accurate. Only in this way can prices be controlled without being controlled by black market prices. Once prices can be stabilized, raw materials will be cheaper, and wages can also be maintained at a certain level without causing disputes at any time. Then the factory can work with peace of mind, and even export trade should have the hope of gradually improving.

Full Text of the Linked System Draft

Regarding the implementation of the import and export linked system, the full text of the draft adjustment of import and export trade measures is attached below:

(Chapter 1 General Provisions) Article 1: These measures are specifically formulated in order to revitalize exports, encourage the import of essential materials, so as to prosper the economy and adjust the trade balance. Article 2: After the implementation of these measures, the previously promulgated revised provisional measures for import and export trade and measures to encourage export trade, which conflict with these measures, shall be amended or repealed at the same time.

(Chapter 2 Export) Article 3: All goods except those listed in Schedule 5 (prohibited exports) may be freely exported, but the exporter shall submit a certificate from the designated bank proving the use of its foreign exchange to the customs for verification before being allowed to declare export. Article 4: The foreign exchange earned from exports shall be designated for use as foreign exchange required for imports, and the designated bank shall handle its related procedures.

(Chapter 3 Import) Article 5: All goods, except those in Schedule 4 (prohibited imports), shall be allowed to be imported only after completing the procedures in accordance with the provisions of these measures. Article 6: For the import of various goods belonging to Schedule 1 (production equipment), the importer may apply to the Central Bank for legal foreign exchange, which shall be provided by the government. Article 7: For the foreign exchange required for various goods belonging to Schedule 2 (originally under the quota system) and various goods belonging to Schedule 3A, the importer shall export local goods on its own, or purchase export foreign exchange from other exporters to offset it. The price is not restricted by the statutory exchange rate, but the government, in order to encourage the import of industrial equipment and raw materials, may separately list Schedule 3B to allow importers to apply to the Central Bank for a statutory exchange rate for 1/5 of the import amount. Article 8: The government shall designate several banks as foreign exchange banks. All foreign exchange supply and demand and certificates of importers and exporters shall be handled by the designated banks and reported to the Central Bank every week.

(Chapter 4 Low-Interest Loans) Article 9: For import and export transactions that meet the regulations and have all the certificates (order form, letter of credit, shipping contract, etc.), they may apply to the designated loan bank (Bank of China) for a low-interest loan, which shall be accepted by the designated foreign exchange bank. The term shall be three months, and it may be extended for another three months if necessary. The interest rate shall be 2% per month. Article 10: In order to prevent the hoarding of goods, on the due date of repayment, the customs export certificate and import certificate shall be submitted for verification. If the certificate cannot be provided by the deadline, it shall be treated as hoarding and penalized, and ordered to repay the interest calculated according to the current market rate, or 60% of the quantity of goods filled in at the time of applying for the loan.

Issuing Loans to Encourage Production

Increasing production and conserving consumption, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Chinese Farmers Bank shall immediately announce the implementation of this year's agricultural investment plan, step by step, for silk, tea, tung oil, hog bristles, cotton, wheat, etc. The production loan should be cut off and a large amount of loan should be made to avoid delaying the farming season, and it should be stipulated that part or all of the loan should be repaid with the produced physical objects. The price shall be evaluated by both parties according to the market value. This method shall also be applicable to loans from various factories. The government controls the above-mentioned physical objects for the needs of foreign sales and parity. The products of state-owned agencies shall be promoted for foreign sales as much as possible, and domestic consumption should be reduced to the minimum limit in order to increase foreign exchange and balance payments.

### Party Headquarters Executive Committee Resolves to Request Thorough Investigation of Gold Rush Causes

The Municipal Party Headquarters held its 47th Executive Committee meeting at 9 am yesterday in the conference hall of the headquarters, chaired by Chairman Fang, and resolved (A) Regarding the Quanggong Building incident, (1) Request the government to thoroughly investigate the culprits and punish the murderers, (2) Suggest the government to inform all kinds of mass gatherings in this city in the future must follow the practice of democratic countries and notify the police organs in advance to send police to maintain order. (B) Regarding the soaring gold price, (1) Please ask the Central Government to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the soaring gold price this time, and please thoroughly investigate the names of the firms and people who purchased gold and publish the list. (2) It is suggested that the Central Government strictly prohibit gold bars as a transaction currency. (3) It is suggested that the government order all stores to restore the original prices after the gold price drops for the prices that have soared due to the gold price rush in order to stabilize people's livelihood.

### Circular to All Industries Not to Blindly Follow Price Increases

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified all industries yesterday: "To whom it may concern, in the past ten days, the price of gold has soared, and the prices of goods have also risen, which is the most intense trend in the past ten years since the war. In this situation, not only the national economy and people's livelihood are on the verge of despair, but the business community is also in a dilemma. If it collapses, how can there be any reason to be spared? For this reason, this association is worried day and night, and has no choice but to sincerely tell all of you in the business community. Since the national currency system changed to the managed currency system, gold and legal tender have lost a certain degree of connectivity. In other words, since gold is no longer the reserve for the issuance of national currency, it is no longer the measure of various prices. The free buying and selling of gold in the market, its market price rises and falls, is only equal to the market price rises and falls of jewelry and diamonds, and should no longer have the possibility of influencing prices. It is only because in recent years, the general psychology is easily stimulated, and there is always excessive speculation. In addition, there are those who add fuel to the fire, predicting what extent a certain price will rise, and spreading it to each other. If you are not surprised by the strange, then this trick will naturally be helpless. However, people's hearts are weak and easily fluctuate, often leading to a situation where one person starts and hundreds follow, competing with each other. In the beginning, this kind of psychology was nothing more than to avoid the situation of "replenishing missing goods" later. Their intention was still out of self-defense, but in the short term, wages, help materials, rent, and interest must also rise accordingly. The benefits of the price increase are just enough to offset it, and in fact it is still unhelpful, resulting in a situation where the books are profitable but the physical objects are short. This is the inner pain of today's general legitimate businessmen. This association is a merchant group, and it is deeply saddened that it has not been able to find a way to resolve this deformed phenomenon. According to the above situation, the current price increase is different from the two phenomena before the war. Before the war, the cost must increase before the price increase. Now, the price often rises first and the cost rises later. This opposite phenomenon is completely caused by the turbulent situation. In essence, it is manipulated by uneasiness, and the result is harmful to others and unhelpful to oneself. In addition to submitting to the government to re-determine the gold policy, implement import and export sales, grasp materials, control prices, increase production, and conserve consumption, this association hopes that our business community will deal with this difficult situation with calm reason. Unless the cost is indeed increased, do not blindly follow the price increase first. Even if there is a reason to increase the price, the standard must be legal profits, and do not make excessive price increases to avoid criticism and legal sanctions. It is easier to win by anticipation than by hope. I hope that your association will forward it to all industries for their information."

### Kong Xiangxi Sends Letter to Authorities Requesting Investigation of Rumor-Mongering Truth; Matters Concern National Security, Not Just Personal Reputation

Mr. Kong Xiangxi, a member of the Central Committee, recently sent letters separately to Mayor Wu and Supervisor Cheng, requesting them to dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth behind the rampant rumors caused by the recent surge in gold prices, in order to clarify the facts and rectify public opinion. His letter to Mayor Wu stated: "To Brother Guozhen, Honorable Mayor: The safety of a place lies in the stability of society. Recently, the drastic fluctuations in gold prices have caused widespread anxiety and soaring prices, breaking all previous records. Tracing the cause, it is purely due to malicious individuals spreading rumors, either seeking speculative profits or harboring other intentions, hoping to disrupt the security of Shanghai. Day by day, the situation worsens, with baseless fabrications and attacks against me personally, amplified by the wide circulation of tabloids, causing social unrest. The impact on my personal reputation is insignificant, but the safety of the nation and the stability of society are of utmost importance. Shanghai is the commercial center for both China and foreign countries, and the safety of friendly foreign nationals residing here is particularly important. If unscrupulous individuals are allowed to spread rumors, causing market disturbances, how can we face the nation and the people? This matter is of utmost importance. I urge you to dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth, severely punish the rumor-mongering villains, stabilize public sentiment, and ensure the safety of this city. This is what I hope for." The letter to Supervisor Cheng contained similar content, so it is not recorded here.

### Unscrupulous Merchants Hoarding White Rice; Three Locations Raided, Greatly Pleasing the Public

[Our Dispatch] In recent days, the black market price of white rice has been rising crazily along with the gold rush, exceeding 150,000 yuan per dan. Although the municipal government is selling Saigon rice without restriction every day, it still cannot suppress the rising trend. Moreover, some rice shops, after receiving Saigon rice, are even privately raising prices and selling it in bulk, which seriously affects the people's food supply. The authorities have now dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate, and any rice shop found hoarding white rice will be forced to sell it at the assessed price.

Yesterday at 1:00 PM, Liu Liang, the owner of Taifeng Rice Shop at 217 Harbin Road (from Taixing), was reported to the Hudong Inspection Office of the Garrison Command for hoarding a large quantity of white rice. After dispatching personnel to investigate, in addition to discovering more than 40 dan in the room of the owner's wife, they also seized more than 260 dan on the third floor of Nanjing Bathhouse at 229 (owned by the same boss), all Changxi white rice. Immediately, together with the shop staff, they sold it all at the retail price of 1,000 yuan per liter at the shop, with a limit of five liters per person. After hearing the news, residents in the vicinity were overjoyed and lined up to buy, and it was sold out by the evening.

[Our Dispatch] At around 1:00 PM yesterday, a dispute arose at Jiang Yongsheng Rice Shop at 918 Yongxing Road, Zhabei, because the shop was closed and refused to sell rice to the public, causing a serious situation. Someone reported it to the Zhabei Police Bureau, and Branch Director Ying ordered Section Chief Wang to lead the police to the scene. It was learned that there were 63 dan of white rice hidden inside and upstairs in the shop, clearly hoarding for speculation. Section Chief Wang interrogated the shop assistants about whether there were other locations storing rice. They said that there was also a stockpile in Yongan Rice Shop at 786 Datong Road, so they went to search and found another 40 dan of white rice. At that time, Section Chief Wang, together with the district chief and the baojia chief, sealed the two shops with a seal, totaling 103 dan of rice. Subsequently, Jiang Yongsheng, the owner of Jiang Yongsheng Rice Shop, and Xu Yizhong, the owner of Yongan Rice Shop, were detained for interrogation. Jiang Yongsheng, the owner of Jiang Yongsheng Rice Shop, claimed to be 33 years old, from [unclear], and said that some of the rice belonged to a certain client who had deposited it there. When asked about the client's name and address, he could not answer. Xu Yizhong, the owner of Yongan Rice Shop, stated that he was 35 years old, from Dachang, and that a cart carrying 40 dan of white rice had recently been brought by a person with the surname Jiang, entrusting the shop to mill it. The branch bureau believed that Jiang and others had violated the regulations on hoarding food during extraordinary times and planned to send the two to the Garrison Command for investigation.

### Tired of Hearing, Tired of Hearing, Price Increases Repeatedly; Airlines Submit Request to Ministry Again; Moviegoers' Burden Doubles; Public Transportation Follows Suit

[Our Dispatch] China and Central Airlines are confirming international dates. It is learned that the passenger and freight rates of both foreign airlines are about to increase, and this matter is still being requested from the Ministry of Communications. Due to insufficient income and expenditure, especially the passenger fares are not enough to offset the gasoline consumption, the two companies had submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications before the end of the year to increase fares and freight rates by 100%. However, this request has not yet been approved. Recently, the market has fluctuated, the black market for US dollars has soared, and gasoline prices have also risen accordingly. Moreover, a lot of aviation equipment and some foreign employees' salaries must be paid in US dollars, so the losses are increasing. Recently, the two companies have submitted a document to the Ministry of Communications again, urging them to approve the price increase.

From this month's sixteenth (Sunday), the ticket prices of cinemas in this city will be adjusted by about double. The ticket price for first-run cinemas is from 4,500 yuan to 8,000 yuan, the second-run is from 3,500 yuan to 6,000 yuan, the third-run is from 2,500 yuan to 5,000 yuan, and the fourth-run is from 2,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan. Each cinema will set its new ticket price within the above standards according to the location. At the same time, the ticket price is the same regardless of day or night, Sunday or holidays.

Due to the increase in fuel prices and the collection of surcharges on coal and diesel, the price of trams and buses in this city may increase soon. The new fare may increase by 100%, and the exact amount is currently being calculated by the municipal authorities.

### Mayor Sincerely Expresses That Residents Should Rest Assured

[Our Dispatch] Mayor Wu said when he met with reporters at the Municipal Government yesterday: He is making every effort to stabilize the prices of general major commodities in this city. He believes that the current fluctuations in general commodity prices are mainly affected by fluctuations in gold and banknote prices. However, the central authorities are planning a comprehensive financial and economic strategy and will implement it soon, so the fluctuations in gold and banknotes are obviously at the end of their rope and can be easily defeated. As far as the major commodities under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government are concerned, for the issue of rice, the Municipal Government now has sufficient power to supply 2 million bags of rice. Therefore, before the new rice arrives in the fall, there will be no problem with rice in this city. In recent days, the Municipal Government has also been selling 10,000 dan of Saigon rice every day at a price of 63,000 yuan per dan. This amount is sufficient for the city's daily consumption and more. The Municipal Government has also dispatched police to conduct random inspections of rice shops' rice sales to prevent rice shops from selling large amounts to customers and hoarding them privately. Starting yesterday, the municipal government will distribute 12,000 bags of rice at a fixed price and will not stop it. In terms of cooking oil, private factories lack raw materials, and solutions are being sought. However, the state-run China Vegetable Oil is still operating as usual. He sincerely hopes that the citizens will rest assured and cooperate with the authorities to prevent speculators from using their tricks.

### Hiding Fourteen Barrels of Oil, Bribing 200,000 Yuan; Gas Station Staff Arrested and Interrogated

[Our Dispatch] When Sergeant Pan Ronglu of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police was patrolling at 8:00 PM on the 10th of this month, he passed the Asia Petroleum Company gas station at 58 Fenhuangdu Road and saw that there were many cars waiting to refuel, but the staff at the station said that the gasoline had been sold out.

The staff at the station were pouring gasoline into oil drums, so he went over to check and saw that there were fourteen barrels of gasoline hidden in the station.

### Love Triangle; Female Servant Dies Tragically

[Our Dispatch] The Zhu family at 14 He Da Lane, Pushi Road, hired a female servant, Shen Amao (26 years old, from Huzhou). Recently, due to illness, she was sent to her aunt Chen Wenjun at 471 Xiaoshadu Road for temporary residence. After a few days, her illness worsened, so on the 5th, she was accompanied by her aunt to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment. She died on the 7th. According to the doctor's examination, the deceased suffered serious injuries to her chest and knees, and it was feared that she had been beaten to death before her death. Her aunt reported the information to the Jiangning Branch Bureau, and Section Chief Chen sent staff Wang Qi, together with police officers Lu Tianci and Gu Songlin, to investigate. It was learned that the deceased had an affair with a cook, Wu Chengbing, who is now employed at 19 Dumei Road. The police officers arrested Wu on the 8th and brought him to the bureau. He admitted that the affair was true, but denied the assault. Later, they summoned Abao and Aqi, who were also female servants in the Zhang Xujing family at the same address, to the bureau for interrogation. They confessed that Amao also had a lover, Yan Aqing, also known as Ma Pi Aqing, who was a porter and whose address was unknown. It was only known that he had a relative, Wei Luosheng, who was a tea waiter at the Chunjiang Inn at the entrance of the Yunnan Road vegetable market. When Yan came to Shanghai from his hometown, he always rented a room at the inn. The police officers went to Wei's place to inquire about Yan's whereabouts and learned that Aqing had returned to Xiecun, Shuanglin Town, Wuxing County, his original home. The police officers took a car overnight to the above-mentioned location, but Yan had already taken goods to Shanghai. They tracked him back to Shanghai and went straight to Chunjiang Inn to investigate. They arrested him at the inn and brought him to the bureau for interrogation, but he also denied everything. According to the testimony of the two female servants, at about 8:00 PM on the 2nd, Wu Chengbing came first, and then Yan Aqing, the lover of the relationship, also came. Amao had difficulty coping with it. Wu Chengbing suddenly left first and said that he would never come again. Not long after, Aqing and Amao quarreled, and Amao was punched and beaten by Aqing. After the preliminary trial by the branch bureau, although there was no evidence that Yan had committed the assault, he was suspected of being a major offender, and it was planned to send Wu and Yan together to the District Attorney's Office for review.

### Postage Increase Not Yet Approved; Postal Bureau Faces Many Difficulties Due to Insufficient Funds

[Our Dispatch] A reporter interviewed a person in charge of the Postal Bureau yesterday, and he told about various aspects of the postal service: (1) Regarding the postage increase, the General Bureau has indeed submitted it to the government, but it is not yet known whether it will be approved and how much it will be increased. In fact, even if it rises to 500 yuan for ordinary letters, it will not be enough to make up for the Postal Bureau's losses. (2) After Xu [unclear]zhuang, the Director-General of the Postal Administration, resigned, the ministry appointed Deputy Director Huo to take over, but Huo坚 firmly requested to resign because of the many difficulties in the Postal Bureau, and the handover has not yet been completed, forming a stalemate. (3) Due to the Postal Bureau's insufficient income and expenditure, the authorities intend to reduce the salaries of employees, but in fact, it may be difficult to reduce the benefits that employees have already received. If the postal service continues like this, it will not end well. He believes that the solution is to advance on three fronts: first, the government approves the price increase and continues to subsidize it; second, the people understand the difficulties of the Postal Bureau and do not attack the price increase; third, the postal employees should be united and willing to make concessions on their benefits to overcome the difficulties together. (4) The Postal Bureau in this city has recently implemented a new facility, which is to add special mailboxes in key areas to collect express mail along the Beijing-Shanghai line. These mailboxes are painted gray with red letters. The collection time is later than ordinary mailboxes. Mail dropped before 10:00 PM can be delivered to cities along the Beijing-Shanghai line by the night express train the next day.

### The Task of Miss 09 at the Telephone Company Information Desk

Specializing in Checking and Answering Telephone Numbers; Working Tensely and Skillfully Day and Night

[Our Special Article] When you want to make a phone call but don't know the phone number, just dial "09" and ask, and the difficulty can be easily solved.

"09" is the number of the Shanghai Telephone Company's information desk, and its special task is to answer inquiries about telephone numbers.

The "Information Desk" provides services day and night, 24 hours a day without interruption. It is divided into four shifts every day, and each shift has twelve "Miss 09" to answer various inquiries about telephone numbers.

Their work is very tense. On average, each person has to answer more than fifty inquiries every hour. Because they all have more than two or three years of experience, they work very skillfully.

The telephone directories they check are loose-leaf, rotating, with Chinese arranged according to the number of strokes and English arranged in alphabetical order. Due to the accumulation of experience, they have memorized the number of strokes of each character, so they can check them very quickly.

Whether the phone number is in the phone book or not, they can find it, but many party and government leaders, social celebrities, and military agencies are unwilling to publish their phone numbers, and they also refuse to answer.

The most inquiries about phone numbers are for restaurants, hotels, and theaters, and the "Miss 09" are already familiar with the phone numbers of these places. They don't need to check them and can answer them immediately. The busiest time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.

The most headache for "Miss 09" is that some people often deliberately harass them under the pretext of inquiring about telephone numbers, hindering their normal work.

The "Information Desk" also has an important task, which is to record the movement of various telephones at any time. Because many telephones often change hands and change the name of the household, for the convenience of inquiries, they must also change the owner of the telephone at any time.

The "Clock" That Can Talk

In addition to the telephone number information desk, the telephone company also has a time service. If you want to know the standard time, just dial "95678" and you can hear someone reporting alternately in Shanghai dialect and English.

When asking about the time, there is one thing to pay attention to, that is, you don't need to speak, because the ears of the lady reporting the standard time are blocked with cork, so no matter how loudly you shout, she can't hear you.

Usually, after we dial "95678," we always think that the lady reporting the standard time is directly answering us. In fact, she is just sitting there, looking at the standard clock, and reporting to the sound transmitter forever. She doesn't need to answer the phone. Her job is just to keep reporting. A person is changed every fifteen minutes, and everyone takes turns. It never stops in 24 hours. They are always sitting there, reporting "10:15, Ten Fifteen, 10:15..." This is perhaps the most mechanical job in the world. A young person becomes a talking clock.

### Stable Life - The Social Affairs Bureau Drafts Measures - Rationing System for Daily Necessities - The City Government's Discussion Items Today Include Seven Items: Rice, Coal, Oil, Sugar, Salt, and Cloth - Temporarily Limited to Public Education, Cultural Circles, and Industrial Workers

[Report from this newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, upon receiving a telegram from the Chairman, took the night train to Nanjing last night to discuss ways to suppress commodity prices in the city. Mayor Wu, due to busy official duties, did not accompany him. The General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, Shu Zhang, was represented by Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing due to illness, and left for Nanjing yesterday morning.

Director Wu told reporters at his private residence yesterday: Last year, the focus of the Social Affairs Bureau's work was on handling labor-capital disputes. This year, the focus is on how to enable people to live. If factories go bankrupt and workers become unemployed, leading to mutual destruction, then there will be no so-called labor or capital.

Increasing Cost of Living - Inevitable Crisis

Commodity prices have been fluctuating violently recently, and people's lives have been greatly affected. Public educators, industrial workers, and cultural workers are struggling on the brink of starvation, which cannot be ignored. If effective measures are not taken to provide substantial remedies, the increase in the cost of living index will inevitably affect the cost of all manufactured goods. The increase in the cost of various goods will inevitably affect general living expenses. Such a cycle of repeated increases will inevitably hinder production, increase unemployment, and plunge the entire social economy and social order into a crisis that cannot be sustained. It was previously heard that the Chairman's Office would ration daily necessities to public educators to stabilize their lives. A few days ago, I also suggested to Mayor Wu that a system of rationing daily necessities at affordable prices be implemented for public educators, industrial workers, and female chemical workers in the city. After there is a surplus, a goods supply center will be established to distribute goods at affordable prices to the general public. This measure will be submitted to the municipal meeting on the 14th (today) morning for discussion. However, because rice and oil for rationing are held by the Ministry of Food, coal is held by the Fuel Management Committee, and cloth is managed by the Textile Construction Company, I am waiting for President Song to come to Shanghai to ask for instructions. Now that President Song is still in Nanjing, and I have received a telegram from the Chairman, I will contact all relevant parties about this matter after going to Nanjing.

Regarding the resignation issue, Director Wu said: My purpose is not to be an official, but to do things. Mayor Wu has expressed his full support for the proposed system of rationing daily necessities at affordable prices. If it can be implemented, I will try it. Otherwise, the Social Affairs Bureau cannot function and will still resign.

Main Content of the Proposed Measures

In order to stabilize life and suppress commodity prices, the Social Affairs Bureau has formulated the first step of the rationing measures, the main content of which is:

(1) The rationing items are limited to daily necessities. The items and the allocation amount for each household are tentatively set as follows: (A) One dan of rice per month, (B) One dan of coal briquettes per month, (C) Five jin of cooking oil per month, (D) Three jin of sugar per month, (E) One zhang and five chi of cloth per quarter, (F) Five jin of salt per month, (G) Two bags of flour per month (Those who do not eat rice can apply to have it changed to flour).

(2) Eligible recipients: (A) Public educators stationed in the city and by the Central Government in Shanghai, (B) Workers in public utilities and industrial workers in the city, (C) Cultural workers employed in the city. The number of personnel in category A shall be based on the legally approved establishment. The personnel in categories B and C shall be limited to those whose respective groups have been legally registered with the local competent authorities. However, if more than one person in each household is engaged in the above-mentioned work, only one share will be rationed.

(3) If the products of state-owned or government-managed factories meet the uses of the above-mentioned Article 1, they shall first provide flat-priced rationing according to the quantity approved by the rationing agency, and the rest shall be sold by the factories themselves.

(4) When workers in each factory apply for rationing, if the products of each factory meet the uses of the above-mentioned Article 1, the rationing agency may approve the quantity and ration them at flat prices, and the rest shall still be sold by each factory itself.

(5) If the products of private factories are not included in the above-mentioned Article 1 (such as soap, matches, cigarettes, medicinal oil, etc.), and their workers have been approved for rationing upon application, the rationing agency may approve the quantity and order them to be rationed at flat prices separately in order to promote the extension.

(6) Factories that provide rationing items may be given preferential treatment and fully supplied with electricity and other needs.

(7) The price of rationing items shall be jointly formulated by the rationing agency and another review committee, and submitted to the municipal government for approval before being announced and implemented.

(8) For factories that are allowed to provide rationing, if their wages are calculated and paid according to the cost of living index, the rationing items included in the index shall be recalculated according to the rationing price.

(9) The above-mentioned rationing affairs shall be handled by a temporary organization organized by the municipal government. Its staffing and expenses shall be submitted for approval separately.

At the court hearing yesterday, the defendant Xu Jichuan wore a gray Russian hat and a black riding breeches overcoat, with a sick face.

I was in poor health and had hobbies. At that time, I applied for exemption from military service but was not allowed.

Then, the second defendant, Xu Yuanlai, was interrogated. He was accused of having served as a secretary in the Shanghai Branch of the Income Tax Bureau of the Puppet Ministry of Finance and as a tax collector in the Puppet Changzhou Danyang Consumption Tax Bureau.

### Bloodshed at the Quanggong Building - District Attorney's Office Schedules Summons - Whether Chen Shijun is Guilty or Not - Can Only Be Determined After Investigation

[Report from this newspaper] Liu Yongzhi, the prosecutor in charge of the Quanggong Building bloodshed case, issued summons yesterday, scheduling the 18th and 19th of this month to summon Chen Shijun, chairman of the District Three Department Store Workers' Union, who was accused by the three injured workers, Wang Yuxiang and others, of instigating the injury, the family of Liang Renda, who died from serious injuries, and the twenty-one workers who were arrested by the Huangpu Branch Bureau at the time for fighting with each other. The prosecutor believes that this case is not complicated in law, but the murderer who beat Liang Renda is quite difficult to arrest at the moment. He hopes that the city government's investigation can find something to help with the investigation. As for whether Chen Shijun is guilty or not, it can only be known after investigation.

### Another Gang of Thieves Caught on the Beijing-Shanghai Train - Impersonating Soldiers to Specialize in Cutting Open Suitcases

The Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration recently cracked another organized gang of pickpockets called the "Yuehan Gang" who specialize in impersonating soldiers and stealing on the Beijing-Shanghai train. The details are as follows:

After cracking the "Four Famous Mountains" case, Police Chief Wang Zhaohu secretly ordered plainclothes officers from the Shanghai-Wuxi section to disguise themselves as passengers and infiltrate the train to investigate. On the morning of February 12, a passenger named Zhou Zhengqing on the second-class carriage of Train No. 11 from Beijing to Shanghai discovered that his suitcase had been cut open and the cash stored inside had been lost. He reported the information to the railway police on the train and requested an investigation. Upon receiving the news, the railway police and plainclothes officers immediately conducted a secret investigation in the carriage and discovered a young man in military uniform who was behaving suspiciously. Under interrogation, the "soldier" hesitated and stammered. After a search, the original thief was found on the spot. When the train arrived at Shanghai Station, the railway police escorted him to the Shanghai-Wuxi section. Section Chief Zhu Yifei and Branch Section Chief Zhang Hanying personally interrogated him. According to his confession: His name is Zuo Xiujian, and there are more than 30 members in the gang. They originally committed crimes on the Yuehan Railway and have the nickname "Yuehan Gang." Now, because the Yuehan Railway has been damaged and they cannot survive, they have come to Shanghai to specialize in wearing military uniforms and pretending to be soldiers on the Beijing-Shanghai express train. When passengers are asleep, they use small foreign knives made of pure steel to cut open suitcases and steal items. Since coming to Shanghai, they have committed more than 100 cases on the Beijing-Shanghai train. According to the confession, the section immediately dispatched officers to secretly go to the address of the accomplices provided by the criminal and seized a large number of stolen goods on the spot, totaling more than five suitcases. As for the accomplices who are at large, Wang has secretly sent officers to investigate in all directions and has already obtained clues and will be arrested soon.

In addition, the department cracked another case of pickpocketing by impersonating soldiers on the train from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday and decided to transfer it to the District Attorney's Office for strict handling today. The person impersonating the soldier is named Zhou Chunming. He stole 37.5 jin of black foreign cloth from Lin Fengshi on Train No. 59. After being discovered, he was captured by the railway police.

### Reader Information: Legal Queries

(1) A Young Aunt's Affection

Li Huizhen asks: My friend married Miss A several years ago, and their relationship is harmonious. Miss A has a younger sister, Miss B, who, because she often sees my friend, has also developed a romantic relationship with him. They have vowed to marry each other, and Miss A also expresses her deep approval. However, both families are old-fashioned, so they have not spoken up for a long time. Now there are several questions I would like to ask and would be grateful for your answers: (1) Both the man and the woman are of legal age. Can they freely unite? Does the law allow this? (2) Do both sets of parents have any legal grounds to sue, making it possible for the two people to be found guilty? (3) Given that Miss A has already given her approval, can the wedding still be held? [Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] The law does not allow a person who is already married and has a spouse to remarry another person. If someone who has a spouse remarries, it is a violation of the crime of obstructing marriage as stipulated in the criminal law, and there is a possibility of imprisonment for up to five years. The person marrying them is also guilty of the same. Therefore, regardless of whether Miss A approves, your friend cannot hold a wedding with Miss B. If they want to accommodate the facts, then Miss B does not need to get married. They can live together with the purpose of living together as a family, with Miss B as a member of your friend's family.

(2) Remarrying Another

Zhang Xiaozhen asks: A certain lady, my friend, is now twenty-five years old and has a son. Her husband died of illness three years ago. Now I have several questions, please answer them, I will be eternally grateful. (1) If the lady intends to remarry immediately, do I need to go through legal procedures to separate her from the man's family? (2) Who should raise her son? (3) Can she leave without informing them? (4) If the third method is used, will there be any disputes in the future? (5) After remarrying, will the mother be separated from the relationship?

[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) No need to go through the procedures. (2) The paternal grandparents should raise the son. (3) Yes. But it is best to find a way to let the paternal grandparents know about the situation. (4) No. Only if there are no outstanding debts and no possessions belonging to others are taken. (5) Cannot be separated.

### Tightening Credit Leads to Shift in Speculative Funds: Gold Notes Gradually Stabilizing; Closing Price Up 500,000 From Previous Session

[Report from Our Newspaper] Speculation has stabilized yesterday. Most speculative funds are shifting towards yarn stocks. Early morning reports indicate that emergency countermeasures will be implemented soon. The market opened at 6.7 million to 6.9 million, then immediately fell to 6.2 million to 6.3 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 640 bars at a price of 6.3 million. After this, the situation stabilized, and the high price rose to 6.9 million. Credit tightened, and with yarn and cloth allocation, speculative funds shifted. Near noon, the price dropped to 6.3 million, and at noon it stood at around 6.5 million. In the afternoon, overnight delivery opened close to the 7 million mark, with a high price of 7.7 million, then became hesitant. Evening reports indicated a ban on gold note speculation, and the price dropped to 6.75 million. Finally, it remained at around 7.2 million, resulting in a rebound of 500,000 compared to the previous closing price. Gold ornaments were listed at 680,000, and silver dollars rose slightly. The black market overnight interest rate remained tight, with interest rates at around 1.8 cents.

Foreign currency also stabilized yesterday. US dollars opened in the black market at 12,000 to 13,000 in the morning, with the high price only slightly exceeding 14,000, lacking significant changes. The market remained stable in the afternoon, but trading seemed sluggish. The result was a rise of 1,000 compared to the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes rose from around 2,600 to the 3,000 mark, and the result was also a 100 increase before the previous close. The foreign exchange market lacks formal trading, and dealers remain hesitant. The Hong Kong exchange rate fell to 2,700, the Indian exchange rate to 3,300, and the British exchange rate to 43,500. Market conditions are chaotic, and there is very little trading.

Continuous Surge in Gold Prices is Purely Fictitious Transactions Among Dealers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, a financial observer said: Observing the trend of gold in the past one or two days, it seems to be returning from splendor to simplicity. He believes that the peak of 8 to 9 million a few days ago was purely a fictitious price among dealers, and the actual transaction volume was extremely small. Powerful and prudent speculators only temporarily held a wait-and-see attitude when the market shouted a false price of over 9 million, and dared not act rashly. Now, the authorities' emergency countermeasures are about to be implemented, so the future of gold prices is predicted to hover around the 5 to 6 million mark. As for rumors of the government taking back the funds, he believes that it is unlikely. The government currently holds sufficient gold, enough to publicly sell and stabilize gold prices. Implementing nationalization at this time would only stimulate gold prices to rise further, which would not help in practice. However, he believes that the government's current policy on gold may continue to supply small amounts of gold for people's daily ornaments. However, for the part of gold that is used for speculative purposes, it will find ways to eradicate it, so that gold will no longer become the initiator of speculative waves.

### Accounts for Selling Gold Can be Announced at Any Time

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the outside world's request for the Central Bank to announce the accounts for selling gold and the names of the buyers, this reporter specifically visited the responsible persons of the Central Bank's Operations Bureau and Audit Department yesterday. They all said that President Bei had not yet returned to Shanghai, so it was not convenient to express their opinions. However, they said: The Central Bank's usual allocation and sale of gold is only to members of the recognized gold industry association. Therefore, the accounts are simple and can be made public at any time.

Continued Decline in Government Bonds

Government bonds continued to decline yesterday. Unified bonds

Opened at 650 in the morning, then sold from 614 and 452, retreating to 2600. 550 took advantage of the low price to maintain it and rose to 2700 at the end. The result was a further drop of 350 compared to the previous close. A and B each dropped 250, and D and E also fell 300. The transaction was 3 million.

Foreign Stocks Recover

Foreign stocks recovered slightly yesterday, but the process was volatile. Foreign firms made more efforts to acquire paper companies such as Jardine Matheson, and the results were all closed at high prices. As a result, shipping rose by 20%, British Union rose by 15%, Jardine Matheson Yisha rose by more than 10%, and Yeguang Paper rose by 5%. The rest all rose slightly.

### Continued Decline in Silk

The silk market continued to soften yesterday. 120-count rayon opened at 6.23 million in the morning, then declined, trading at 5.98 million. In the afternoon, there were many who bought at low prices, and it rose again, with a asking price of 6.1 million. Finally, it was raised by 400,000, but the result was still 200,000 lower than the previous day. Factory prices also fell due to the decline in gold prices. The transaction prices for C-grade varied. The largest transaction was 7.5 million, and the smallest was 200,000, with some transactions. The asking price for D-grade was 7 million, which was more than 300,000 lower than the previous day. The asking prices for ordinary goods and Qianjing were both 200,000 lower than the previous day. Due to the drop in raw materials, factory prices for silk fabrics also decreased. The asking price for Meiya quilt fabric was 4.3 million, and the asking price for rayon quilt fabric was 3 million. Yesterday, there was a transaction at 2.85 million. Dachang Gebi crepe was 16,000, and Huazhong crepe was listed at 6,200, with transactions at 6,000. Rayon feather yarn was in short supply, and yesterday's price was the same as Huajin crepe. The asking prices for Sheng Hang goods remained the same as the original prices from the previous day. The market was very weak, and the market trend may still depreciate, so yesterday's silk transactions were very limited.

### Goods Must Be Shipped Within Three Months After Issuance of Import Permits

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank issued Circular No. 12 of the Second Category to each designated bank yesterday, making some revisions to the provisions of the first paragraph of Circular No. 10 of the Second Category. The circular briefly stated: Goods listed in Annexes 1 and 3A must be shipped within three months from the date of issuance of the import permit. Furthermore, the validity period of the permit is limited to four months from the end of the month in which the goods are shipped.

### Tea Market Transactions are Sparse

Although it was raining heavily yesterday, export firms continued to demand various types of export tea. At the same time, local shops were also frequently considering adding Longjing and Dafang varieties for domestic sales, so there was a lot of buying in the market. However, those who held the goods were still shrewd, holding on to their goods, resulting in a supply imbalance and sparse transactions.

### Even Though Rice and Glutinous Rice Have Not Arrived, the Black Market Has Already Collapsed Yesterday

The food rice and miscellaneous grain markets, which had been crazy for several days, began to fall back yesterday. People were nervous, and under the atmosphere of selling, prices fell across the board. Those who held the goods were wary of the high prices and secretly sold off. In addition, the social police and security bureaus tightened their crackdowns, strictly checking the movement of rice and grain at various intersections. Therefore, rice merchants were deeply restrained and were very cautious. Rice shops were also reluctant to buy in because it was not easy to sell, so the market began to experience a tragic downturn. Asking prices outside the market fell by more than 30,000 yuan. High-quality white rice was 135,000 yuan. There were no buyers in the market, and the market remained stagnant. However, the arrival of glutinous rice gradually increased. A total of more than 700 stones arrived in the market, and the market also showed signs of weakness. The distribution of No. 2 Saigon rice by the Social Bureau was temporarily suspended yesterday because the shipment procedures had not been completed.

Flour

Due to the decline in rice prices, people's hearts were shaken, and cargo owners sold off when prices were high. Buyers were hesitant to move forward. Under the situation of more sellers than buyers, the market price fell sharply. The prices of various brands of flour fell by 56,000 yuan. The closing price of Bingchuan and Lao Che flour was 55,000 yuan. The closing price of Lilang foreign flour was 72,000 yuan. There were no buyers for these prices in the market, and it is expected that prices will continue to fall. Wheat also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Edible Oil

The sharp decline continued. Because the previous rise had aligned prices with those in other regions, many merchants shipped goods in, resulting in a sell-off in the market from the beginning of the day yesterday. However, there were few buyers. Lou Sheng oil fell to 240,000 yuan, then fell further to 230,000 yuan. The lowest price for Jilong Sheng oil fell to 250,000 yuan, and the closing price was 260,000. Sheng oil plummeted by more than 40,000 yuan. Although there were few transactions in soybean oil, the market also quietly fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Small-cart sesame oil also fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Jilong vegetable oil fell to 270,000 yuan in transactions.

Miscellaneous Grains

The fall in yellow beans was particularly severe. There were four shipments from the Northeast, one of which had already arrived at the port and was being unloaded. Therefore, people's hearts were greatly weakened. The supply of samples was abundant, and cargo owners were eager to sell for cash. The final price for Dalian and Tianjin goods was 70,000 yuan, a decline of 10,000 yuan. Other goods also fell by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Only Huang Ma sesame had a small number of transactions, and the market also fell by 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were oversupplied and fell by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, but there were still few takers. The price of bean cake raw materials was weak, and small holders rushed to sell, causing the price to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Tea beans and corn were both weak and lacked transactions. Cotton cake also fell by 2,000 to 3,000.

### Coal Trends are Softening

The number of sellers in the coal market is gradually increasing, but asking prices are still erratic. Buyers are wary because coal prices have risen sharply in recent days and the prices of various commodities have fallen back, so they are very hesitant and their willingness to buy is very sluggish. Therefore, transactions are quite sparse. The actual transaction price of Kaiping train coal has fallen from 1.1 million to 1.023 million yuan. There were also reports of Hong Yikuai taking advantage of the high price of 1.56 million to sell, so the trend of the coal market may be softening. The new prices for firewood and charcoal have been announced, but buyers find the prices too high to afford, so transactions are also flat.

### Yarn Market Actual Sales are Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to move downstream. Dealers were eager to sell, but actual sales were few. Buyers did not buy, and factories also waited and watched, so the price of 10-count yarn fell by another 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, and the trend seemed to be sluggish.

### Import and Export Management Committee Prevents Hoarding of Imported Industrial Raw Materials; Must Be Sold Directly to Production Factories; Cigarette and Rubber Industries Have Already Done So

The Import and Export Management Committee believes that more than 90% of imports in the second category are industrial raw materials. In order to avoid manipulation by intermediaries and hoarding by wealthy individuals, it has decided that imported goods should be sold to production factories. The monthly production quantity and the raw materials required must be reported by each importer. The committee will allocate goods to importers based on the production needs of each factory and according to quotas. The committee is now starting with importers in the rubber and cigarette industries and will gradually extend this to several types of imported industrial raw materials. It has issued survey forms, notifying each importer to report the quantity ordered and the sales situation, including the factories ordering goods abroad, the date of shipment, the name of the ship, the name of the goods ordered, the location of sales, and the quantity sold. In addition, goods ordered last year that have recently been imported should be included in this year's quota. If the recent arrival of goods accounts for 20% of this year's quota, then this year's import quota will only be 80%.

### New Pharmaceutical Industry Requests the Import and Export Management Committee to Improve the Import Method of Western Medicines

[Report] The New Pharmaceutical Association and several pharmaceutical associations jointly requested the Import and Export Management Committee to improve the import method based on the nature of the medicines. For medicines that our country can manufacture itself, please prohibit imports. For medicines that our country cannot manufacture but are urgently needed, please allow large-scale imports so that our country's pharmaceutical industry will not be hit by foreign imports, and patients will not be delayed due to high prices or shortages of medicines. It has been decided that this submission will be presented today.

Also, recently, the prices of Western medicines have risen sharply due to the high price of the US dollar, rising by an average of more than two times. According to a person in charge of the New Pharmaceutical Association, before the establishment of the import and export management committee, the Western medicine industry in this city ordered a large number of American goods, resulting in a surplus of various American medicines in the market and a general decline in prices. Many medicines even fell below cost. Since the quota import method was stipulated, it has been difficult to apply for permits. In addition, the black market price of the US dollar has risen sharply, and the prices of various medicines have followed the US dollar, rising by one to three times. The prices of ordinary unpopular medicines have risen by one time, and the prices of popular medicines such as Bile Tuo, Gaishi Weixiong, and Cibaoming have risen to four times. However, compared with the current market price and the US dollar black market, it cannot be considered high. In addition, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan has recently decided to allocate a portion of the American goods Ateping and Sulfamine preparations in its inventory to various pharmaceutical merchants, so the market price of such medicines may remain stable. Furthermore, recently, a large number of Commie milk powder, Monsanto saccharin, and Paletuo have arrived in Shanghai, and the general market price is expected to gradually fall back.

### Spinning and Construction Distributes Cloth Using Flexible Prices

The market price of cotton cloth has recently been affected by the rise in gold prices and the manipulation of speculators, rising significantly in the past week. Now, in order to curb speculation and effectively assist actual sales merchants, the Spinning and Construction Company has adopted flexible prices for all grades of cotton cloth opened yesterday. The supply price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is 170,000 yuan. According to Jiang Dixian, director of the company's Business Office, the amount of each cloth supplied is based on the legitimate needs of each applying wholesale and retail cloth shop, and an appropriate amount is supplied.

### Leather Industry in Crisis; Thirty-Three Companies Closed Down

The leather industry in this city is in a state of crisis. Twenty-three companies have already formally declared bankruptcy, and it is estimated that at least twenty to thirty companies have actually suspended work. The reasons are: (1) High cost, (2) Dumping of foreign goods. If there are no effective relief measures within this year, it is feared that no leather factory will be operating in one year. The industry has made a suggestion to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that it find a way to provide relief. The methods are: (1) Low-interest loans, (2) Exemption from commodity tax, (3) Supply as much coal as possible, (4) Prohibition of importing finished leather and foreign exchange settlement for leather goods. The industry believes that if the first three methods can be realized, the cost of sole leather can be reduced to around 8,000 yuan, and the cost of face leather can be reduced to around 6,000 yuan. If the fourth method is realized, a certain profit can be obtained from the selling price, so that our leather industry can recover.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, sugar prices continued to decline in the market, with a slight rebound later. In the morning, small quantities were priced at 230,000 yuan, while in the afternoon, there was a slight improvement.

Refined sugar was priced at 150,000 yuan, and Xing brand sugar at 175,000 yuan. The Taiwan company's public sales continued as before, with quota allocations following the fifth phase distribution. When obtaining purchase orders, responsible personnel must provide a signed guarantee and official stamp to prevent further black market activities, it is said.

### Caustic Soda Prices Decline Again

### Raw Material Shortage Leads to Pencil Price Increase

Recently, raw materials for pencils, such as graphite leads, carbon sand, and lead powder, have become extremely scarce. The market price of pencil leads alone has risen from 1,000,000 yuan to 3,000,000 yuan per ton, causing the wholesale price of domestically produced pencils to increase by 50% compared to the past, it is said.

### School Finances Not Transparent: Teacher at Guanghan Elementary School Dismissed by Principal Without Cause, Files Complaint with Municipal Council

[Our Correspondent] Li Chieh and Sha Chih-chen, teachers at Guanghan Elementary School in this city, expressed concerns during the last semester about the school's lack of financial transparency, which offended Principal Kao Cheng-hsiang, leading to their unwarranted dismissal. Li Chieh and others filed a complaint with the Municipal Council on the 13th of this month, recounting the events and appealing for protection. A written request was also submitted, which stated in part: "We, Li Chieh and Sha Chih-chen, have served at Guanghan Elementary School in Lu Chia Wan in this city for a year. We have always been diligent and dedicated, and we have been certified as qualified by the Municipal Education Bureau. Last semester, we expressed concerns about the school's lack of financial transparency and the unauthorized election of the Economic Audit Committee, which offended Principal Kao Cheng-hsiang. On January 21st, we received a notice stating that we were being dismissed due to a reduction in the school's scope. After investigation, we learned that the school's student population had not decreased, making the claim of a reduction in scope clearly false. Furthermore, the school originally had eleven faculty and staff members, and besides the principal and his wife, two others had not been certified as qualified. If the principal's claim were true, he should have dismissed the unqualified personnel first. However, the principal has acted improperly and abruptly dismissed qualified teachers like us, which is unreasonable. In order to continue serving at the school, we repeatedly asked him to retract his decision, but to no avail. With no other option, we have sent letters to the Shanghai Private Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Living Security Association, the Shanghai Private Primary and Secondary School Federation, and the Shanghai Primary School Teachers Joint Continuing Education Association, requesting assistance. We are now submitting this report and earnestly request that your council uphold justice and provide strong assistance. We have long admired your council as the only public opinion body in this city and believe that you will uphold the protection of teachers' professions. We hope that you will grant our request and provide assistance. We would be eternally grateful!"

### On Ren Yu's Defeat: Strategic Error in the First Half

Ren Yu and Giant clashed, both teams harboring ambitions to win the championship, resulting in fierce competition and a tense process.

In the first half, Ren Yu tried using a five-man zone defense, which was not yet fully refined, and made many wasted shots, leading to a deficit. In the second half, they switched to man-to-man marking, which gradually got on track, and the game became exciting.

In fact, Ren Yu is a team that best understands how to use rules and tactics. Apart from its tight defense, Giant's offense relies solely on brute force. Based on yesterday's performance, Ren Yu had a chance to win. The only reason for their defeat was a strategic error in the first half.

At the start of the game, Ren Yu's decision to use Li Chao-ho, whose basketball skills were unfamiliar, was a major mistake. The situation improved after Wu Hsin-yun was brought in.

Giant took advantage of Ren Yu's confused formation in the first half and did not utilize mid-range shots, otherwise Ren Yu's point deficit in the first half would have been even greater.

Ren Yu's Yao Wen-yi is a good shooter, but not an all-rounder. He still makes mistakes in dribbling and passing.

In the second half, Ren Yu was only two points behind on two occasions, at 23 to 25 and 29 to 31. Ren Yu missed its shots, failing to catch up, which was a great pity. In Group B, there was an upset, with Green Forest losing to Pei Er. Green Forest played too arrogantly and carelessly, while Pei Er played steadily and managed to turn the defeat into victory. Green Forest players were dissatisfied with the referee, and some spectators shouted abuse. It is hoped that this low "level" can be improved in the future. (Chang Nien)

### Record of the Trial of Tani Hisao, the Protagonist of the Nanjing Massacre (Part 2): Witnesses Testify to Atrocities, Spotlight Focuses on Tani Hisao

— Nanjing, 7th Dispatch, Our Correspondent in Nanjing, Zhang Ming and Ding Kuanghua

Today, the seventh, is the second day of the public trial of the war criminal Tani Hisao. The audience is a sea of people, even more enthusiastic than yesterday. The windows are packed with people, an unprecedented phenomenon since the capital began trying traitors. The trial began at 2:00 PM, with presiding judge Shi Meiyu customarily beginning by asking the defendant's name, before moving on to the main issue:

"After investigation by this court, the defendant's troops began a large-scale massacre after entering Nanjing. Was this because they encountered strong resistance during the siege and took retaliatory action?" "There was fierce fighting inside and outside Zhonghua Gate for many days. The residents had long retreated to the safety zone, so the atrocities the presiding judge speaks of are incorrect. It was impossible and unnecessary for atrocities to occur under those circumstances. If there were any, they were definitely not committed by my troops." "All the witnesses unanimously testified that Tani Hisao's troops entered the city on December 13th, while Nakajima's troops only entered on the 14th. Then, who committed the initial two days of massacres if not the defendant's troops?" "The commander of the attack on Nanjing was Commander Yanagawa. Under his command were the 114th Division, directly subordinate troops, and my own troops. Commander Yanagawa was commanding from the front line at Zhonghua Gate, and this can be investigated. If you insist that I am responsible for the atrocities in Nanjing, it would be unfair. Moreover, due to the war in the Zhonghua Gate area, no civilians could have remained. Therefore, there could not have been any massacres. And I swear to Heaven and Earth that I never saw any civilian corpses. You personally participated in the city entry ceremony on the 17th and the memorial service on the 18th. Nanjing was covered with corpses at that time; how could you not have seen them?" The criminals consistently tried to evade responsibility with sophistry.

### Demanding Blood Debt, Requesting Public Execution

Chen Yaodong, Deputy Speaker of the Nanjing Municipal Provisional Assembly, first reported on the investigation into the massacre case from the witness stand. According to him, the investigation was undertaken based on the principles of justice for fellow compatriots and the future of human civilization, and a "Nanjing Municipal Japanese Army Crimes Investigation Committee" was specially established, with Chen himself serving as Deputy Director and concurrently as the head of the investigation team. The investigation resulted in 2,784 cases, which were classified into ten categories based on the crimes of the Japanese army: (1) 1,159 cases of shooting deaths; (2) 667 cases of bayonet deaths; (3) 315 cases of massacres; (4) 136 cases of burning deaths; (5) 69 cases of beating deaths; (6) 33 cases of torture followed by killings; (7) 22 cases of rape followed by killings; (8) 19 cases of deaths from explosions; (9) 11 cases of deaths by drowning; (10) 321 cases not belonging to the above nine categories. After the report, he explained two points: (1) Nine out of ten of the 2,784 tragic cases occurred inside and outside Zhonghua Gate, which was the area where the defendant's troops were stationed. (2) The most murders occurred in the week from December 12th to 20th of the 26th year [of the Republic of China, 1937], which was the period when the defendant's troops were stationed in Nanjing. Finally, he stated that Councilor Gu, in his capacity, appealed on behalf of the million citizens of Nanjing, demanding that the Japanese military commanders who participated in the attack on Nanjing, Matsui and Yanagawa, all war criminals, be extradited for public execution. As soon as he finished speaking, the entire court applauded. Tani Hisao trembled during this applause, his body seemed to sway, but he immediately pretended to be calm.

Following this, forty-nine witnesses testified in court, recounting the horrific massacre that occurred at the time. It was truly enough to make one's hair stand on end!

### Xu Chuanyin Reports on Burial Work

What grievances and hatreds have been buried in the hearts of these witnesses for ten years? Let us quietly listen to their appeals!

Xu Chuanyin, Chairman of the Red Cross, said this: "When Nanjing fell, I was in Nanjing, serving as Vice-Chairman of the Red Cross and Director of the Defense Group of the International Committee. I personally witnessed the situation when the Japanese entered the city. It was such a chaotic and terrifying scene! Their first act upon entering the city was killing, followed by raping women, then burning houses, and simultaneously robbing civilian property. The day after entering the city, Japanese military officers came to the Red Cross to inquire about our work. When they heard about the organization of burial teams, they were overjoyed, telling us that there were many corpses outside that we could collect. Thus, I was able to patrol the streets, starting from Ninghai Road, passing Xinjiekou, going over Jiankang Road to Zhonghua Gate. The further I went, the more corpses I saw, so many that it was impossible to count them. Our work was naturally very troublesome and difficult, and it was also very difficult to ensure passage for traffic, so burial work was not easy to carry out. Therefore, although the date filled in on the forms is December 22nd, their deaths occurred at least a week earlier. As for the number listed on the forms, it is also inconsistent with the actual number, because at that time, we were afraid of their power and dared not fill in the correct number. So the number filled in was over 40,000, but in reality, it was more than 200,000. The streets were full of corpses; you would have felt like you had entered an area that had just experienced an earth-shattering disaster, letting countless kind people die in any corner."

### Two Japanese Men Gang-Rape Miss Chen

A very simple village girl, Miss Chen, wearing a short cotton-padded jacket and trousers, a light blue shirt, and black hair covering half of her face. She called out, answering the prosecutor's questions.

"Yes, I was raped by the Japanese! There were two Japanese men, two men who raped me in turns."

Someone is laughing. Are they laughing at her for not being ashamed? No, today is the first time she is raising her head to recount to her own people, she is shouting to redeem the indelible humiliation!

### Yao Jialong's Wife and Daughters Died Under Broadswords

Yao Jialong said: "It was on the evening of the 12th. There was arson outside, and I saw it with my own eyes. They used broadswords, with handles, to kill my closest people: my wife, son, and daughters." While speaking, his voice trembled.

### Gui Yuan's Widow Witnesses Her Son Being Killed

Widow Yuan is an eighty-year-old woman, she answered the prosecutor's questions in a very small voice. Her eyes were full of tears, she has not forgotten that scene from ten years ago. She said: "I saw it with my own eyes, they killed my son." That day, she was one who cried and complained in the temporary investigation court, who could bear it? Her own flesh and blood had his life ended by that bloody bayonet.

### Zhao Rongsheng Suffered Eleven Cuts to the Head

Zhao Yesheng is tall and thin, but very energetic. He vividly described, "I fought with a Japanese devil like this, he had a knife and a gun, but I had fists, I had boxing skills. He punched like this, and I returned like this. For a long time, he only wounded places that were not fatal. So I beat him back, and I prolonged my life in a pool of blood. Now, there are eleven knife scars on my head, two gunshot scars on my neck, the middle finger of my left hand is broken off, and my right hand is also deformed." These are all ironclad proofs, he raised both hands, two very inhuman hands, whoever heard it would have a kind of self-comfort. At the very least, he is a hero!

### Zhang Sun's Husband Was Shot Twice

With such a resentful spirit, she had a bellyful of words that she did not want to tell but could not help but tell. She said: "My hatred for the Japanese is so great! I can't finish saying it in three days. My husband was shot twice and died, how he died, I didn't see it, I only heard of it, we didn't have the freedom to take a look. What I saw with my own eyes was: two young girls, one was my sister-in-law, one was my friend, two young girls under the age of twenty were raped by them, they almost had their lives taken."

### Ke Youfu Lost Thirteen Lives

Ke Youfu said: "We were a large family, but they killed everyone who stayed in the house, a total of thirteen lives, my parents, siblings, and workers, as well as four tenants. When I came back from outside, I only saw corpses everywhere, but the reason I was fortunate enough to escape was because I was conscripted!"

### Yu Biwen Suffered Seven Knife Wounds and Two Gunshot Wounds

Yu Biwen's account is somewhat legendary. "There were six of us in total, surrounded by their shiny bayonets. Of course, we could only die. We all fainted amidst the bayonet tips, but like a dream, I woke up again. However, the moment I regained consciousness, the devils discovered me again. They added two more gunshots to me, and I immediately fainted again, but by midnight, I had revived again, and that's how I have lived until now." He opened his clothes, and the scars of seven knife wounds and two gunshot wounds were clearly visible.

### Chen Fubao Recounts Massacres

Chen Fubao recounted everything he wanted to say with a distinctly different demeanor, very methodically: "I will explain in five points: At that time, I had already entered the refugee camp in the safety zone. But they were dragged out at any time to do this and that. (1) They drove me out to a place, I remember there were thirty-nine people, lined up in a row, they turned on the machine guns, and our compatriots fell to the ground in response, and I was told to push the corpses into the pond. (2) One day they took me out to search for property in civilian houses, and after collecting it, they told me to carry it on my back. At that time, I personally saw them gang-raping a young girl in one place. (3) They treated us like toys, pushing us down one by one, if we weren't pushed down, they would kill us, if we were pushed down, they would laugh, in this way, our compatriots' lives ended. (4) The Universal Hotel on Taiping Road, I personally saw them set it on fire and burn it down, and on the same day, I saw the wife of a photographer, who still exists today, being raped while pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage. (5) One day, they conducted another large-scale massacre, gathered us together, expressed their willingness to stabilize our lives, and asked us to state our wishes, whether we wanted to work or go home. After speaking, they asked everyone to kneel on the ground, kowtow, and thank them. Who knew that when we stood up from the muddy ground, they used weapons to escort us away. A large number of people were killed by them, truly resting in peace in the nine springs and happily returning to the earth."

The trial, reports, and appeals are a bloody history, a source of tears, and a story of hatred. And the devil Tani Hisao, today he finally lowered his head in the face of justice. He appeared extremely uncomfortable in front of these witnesses. Although he seemed to be carefully examining a map of Nanjing in his hand while paying attention to the times and locations mentioned by the victims, preparing for his defense and sophistry, how could the facts be easily concealed or refuted?

### Tani Hisao's Crimes are Undeniable: A Scene from the Three-Day Trial

Crimes on the 12th and 13th: Responsibility Pushed to Nakajima Again

The 8th was the third day of the trial of war criminal Tani Hisao. The hearing still started at 2 p.m., and the audience seats were packed, with layer upon layer of dark heads pressing against one another. Because today was the testimony of victims and witnesses recounting the most inhumane facts of the collective massacre by Tani's troops, it was even more crowded than usual, and the atmosphere in the courtroom was also extremely agitated. At 2:05 p.m., the defendant entered the court falteringly. The judge announced the continuation of the investigation of evidence of crimes, with various witnesses describing in detail the circumstances of the massacre at that time, and incidentally investigating Tani's troops' looting of property and coercing women into providing sexual comfort in the Shijiazhuang and Baoding areas. After the interpreter translated, Tani raised his hand and requested to speak, stating roughly: According to the witnesses' statements over the past two days, most of the crimes occurred in the Zhonghua Gate area. In fact, many of the crimes mentioned in the investigation documents as having been committed on the 12th and 13th were committed by Nakajima's troops, and did not occur within his defense area. He requested that the court pay attention to the above statements.

Victim Liang Tingfang Shot After Falling into the River

At this point, the court continued to call victims Liang Tingfang, Bai Zengyun, Chen Fubao, Yin Youyu, Zhu Guangrong and other witnesses. Among them were lonely widows, grieving mothers who had lost their sons, monks and nuns wearing their robes, white-haired bald old men, and survivors who had escaped death. Different identities, different ages, all spoke in unison, painfully recounting the atrocities of the Japanese army in those years and the tragic scenes they had witnessed. Several of the testimonies were particularly harrowing. Liang Tingfang stated: "At 11 a.m. on December 16th, 1937, seven or eight Japanese soldiers went to the refugee area in Wutiao Alley, took hundreds of refugees, and escorted them to the Overseas Chinese Reception Center. At that time, there were already hundreds of people waiting inside. By 5 p.m., more than 5,000 people had been gathered from all directions, arranged in rows of four, and escorted to the riverside in Xiaguan. A large number of Japanese soldiers were already waiting, with machine guns set up. After a senior military officer arrived in a small car and spoke to all the Japanese soldiers, the inhumane massacre began. Starting at 9 p.m., they fired in batches for an hour, and then used bayonets to stab those who had not yet died. He and Bai Zengyun both jumped into the river, and the Japanese soldiers immediately fired into the river. He was hit by a bullet but did not die, and later escaped and entered the city after several days." Chen Fubao: At 10 a.m. on the morning of December 14th, he personally witnessed thirty-seven compatriots being shot. In the afternoon of the 14th, he saw three Japanese soldiers raping a woman in an elementary school in Yinyangying. On the 16th, he saw the Universal Hotel on Taiping Road and the Shengsheng Wood Shop being set on fire and burned by the Japanese army, and also saw a pregnant woman being raped by Japanese soldiers, resulting in a miscarriage. From January 5th to 8th, 1938, Nakajima's troops lured more than 700 of our compatriots and collectively massacred them. Zhu Guangrong said: He personally saw a Japanese army unit with a small flag with the character "Tani" written on it go to his house and kill his son. At the same time, six men and one woman were also killed, and he saw two women being raped. Later, the Japanese soldiers used bayonets to cut open the vaginas of the two women, pulling them up to their chests, and their intestines flowed out. Ye Yushi said: On the 14th, she was more than eight months pregnant when she was gang-raped.

Chongshan Hall's Zhou Yiyu Buried Over 190,000 Corpses

Zhou Yiyu, the person in charge of Chongshan Hall, testified that he was responsible for burying the corpses of over 197,000 civilians. In addition, Ma Wushi and nine other people appeared in court to accuse the Japanese military of killing their relatives. Tani Hisao, as usual, denied and shirked all responsibility. When it was mentioned that the defendant had allowed his subordinates to loot residents of clothing, antiques, and forced women to provide sexual comfort in Shijiazhuang and Baoding, Tani cunningly claimed: "At that time, under the command of Commander Kashii, we were busy preparing to advance south, so looting was impossible, nor would it have happened. The victims were either looted during combat, or by Chinese soldiers in plainclothes and traitors. There was no forced establishment of comfort stations for sexual comfort." All sorts of sophistry were intended to evade his criminal responsibility.

Constitutes Four Crimes: Arson, Looting, Rape, and Massacre

At 4:05 p.m., the court adjourned for a short break, and then continued the hearing, beginning the debate. Prosecutor Chen Guangyu first pointed out: The defendant did indeed constitute the crimes listed in the indictment: First, arson. At that time, Nanjing was a sea of fire, and the Japanese army did not allow the people to put out the fire, and those who violated the order would be killed. Second, looting. At that time, the Japanese army looted everywhere, taking everything. Third, rape. One woman was raped as many as thirty-seven times, one woman was stabbed thirty-three times for refusing to be raped, and a fifteen-year-old girl was raped by three Japanese soldiers and killed, with a bamboo pole inserted into her vagina. Fourth, massacre. The largest number of collective killings was over 57,000 people. In addition, there were batches of over 30,000 people, batches of over 20,000 people, and countless batches of several hundred or several thousand people. The method was to first use machine guns to strafe, then stab with knives, and then set them on fire, or throw them into the water and drown them. For example, at Yanziji, there were over 7,000 disarmed Chinese soldiers who were driven into the river and drowned at one time. The most inhumane acts were threading iron wires through the throats of civilians and injecting live bacteria into prisoners for experimentation. There were also people who had been stabbed seven times and came back to life, but were discovered by the enemy and shot twice more. All of this proves the brutality of the Japanese army. According to the burial statistics of corpses in various places, the number of deaths has exceeded 200,000. In addition to others that were not buried or not included in the statistics, the most conservative estimate is that there were 400,000 victims.

Summarizing the Evidence and Reports: The Defendant Should Bear Five Major Responsibilities

The defendant's responsibilities can be divided into the following five points: (1) According to the investigation report of the Municipal Assembly, more than 500 cases occurred in the Zhonghua Gate area before December 20th, 1937. The time and place all coincide with the time and place of the defendant's presence in Nanjing. (2) According to the testimony of lawyer Cheng Jie, there were especially many injured people in the Zhonghua area. (3) Two witnesses witnessed various units killing people. (4) Large-scale killings are collective acts, and those who participate must be held responsible and cannot shirk responsibility. (5) Before the 14th, no other troops had entered the city, and large-scale massacres had already occurred on the 12th and 13th, so the defendant was the initiator of the massacre, the main culprit. As for the evidence, there are the investigation report of the Municipal Assembly and the local court, the original burial records of the Red Cross and Chongshan Hall, and photos taken by foreigners and the Japanese army themselves. The evidence of the crime is conclusive and irrefutable. If he cannot provide strong counter-evidence, and only tries to shirk responsibility with sophistry, it will be difficult to escape responsibility. The Chinese people have always been broad-minded and benevolent, and have not taken any retaliatory action against the Japanese army, and have safely sent them back to their country, but for the main culprits, such as Tani Hisao, we cannot be lenient and should impose the death penalty.

After the speech, there was a burst of applause from the audience. Tani Hisao's expression was no longer as calm as before when listening to the translation of the Japanese interpreter. He scratched his head and picked his nose from time to time, and stared blankly upwards, looking extremely embarrassed, but he still refused to confess, hoping to deny the charges. He then claimed: "Speculation cannot constitute the conditions for a crime. For a criminal fact, both the perpetrator and the victim should be summoned to the court before it can be determined whether a crime has been committed. One-sided statements cannot become a criminal fact. The defendant hopes to obtain a fair and error-free verdict." At this point, it was already very late. The court ordered another debate hearing to await Tani Hisao's confession.

### The First Peak on the West Pacific Coast: Jade Mountain

— Taipei Air Dispatch on the 20th, Our Reporter Jiang Muyun

The most distinctive feature of the island of Taiwan, meteorologically speaking, is New High Mountain. During the Japanese occupation, a permit was required to climb New High Mountain. Even now, a permit is still needed, but without a group of companions and courage, climbing this mountain is, after all, a difficult task.

New High Mountain, with an altitude of 3,950 meters, was originally named Jade Mountain. Westerners call it Mount Morrison. It is the first high peak on the West Pacific coast. When Japan seized Taiwan, this mountain became the highest peak in the Japanese Empire. On June 28th of the Meiji 30th year, it was renamed "New High Mountain" by imperial decree. After the retrocession, the name New High Mountain should be abolished and the original name "Jade Mountain" restored.

Snowfall Records

New High Mountain is located in the central-southern section of the Central Mountain Range, right on the Tropic of Cancer, its location approaching the geometric center of the entire island of Taiwan. According to the statistics of the New High Mountain Meteorological Observatory over the years, the average winter temperature is one degree, and the summer temperature is seven degrees (average winter air pressure is 481.2, and the summer air pressure is 482.5). The snowfall period is from November to April of the following year, and there is frost from September to May. A meteorological engineer named Yu Ren, who had worked on the mountain for three months, told reporters that he was on the mountain in early November last year. While people on the plains were still wearing single shirts, it had already snowed twice in the early part of the month. At that time, the snowy area was limited to the main peak. Less than 800 meters down the mountain, the snow was no longer visible. In the area around the North Peak, the snowfall period is very short, melting in less than half a day. The highest recorded snowfall was three meters. Freezing is common on the summit, and when the weather suddenly turns very cold, hailstones of various sizes suddenly fall. In a moment, several inches accumulate. On winter nights, as long as the sky is clear and the temperature is very low (the lowest temperature of the year is 12.1 degrees, and the highest is 18.9 degrees), the next morning there are bound to be thick, bright ice blocks in front and behind the meteorological observatory.

Because the air pressure on the mountain is reduced, many strange phenomena are created. Those who travel on the mountain often suffer from a mysterious altitude sickness—dizziness, tinnitus, rapid breathing, mucosal bleeding, loss of appetite, and other symptoms. It takes a few days to get used to it. Here, rice cannot be cooked without a steam pot, and water must be boiled, which is very easy to do in high mountains.

The Hometown of Clouds

The most wonderful thing about the high mountains is the clouds. The ever-changing clouds make people on the high mountains feel like they are in the hometown of clouds. At dawn and dusk, the five colors are brilliant, appearing and disappearing from time to time, sometimes like surging waves, sometimes like light gauze ribbons, and sometimes quietly returning. There are seventy-seven clear days in a year, and seventy days without cloud cover, with observation possible for 218 days throughout the year. The temperature range is small, with an annual average of 75% (81% on the plains). 96% of the celestial bodies can be observed (being able to see 7.4 degrees below the horizon, all of the Northern Hemisphere and within 6.7 degrees of the Southern Hemisphere). At the same time, because there is little dust and the air is transparent, it is the best place to build an astronomical observatory, and it is one of the three locations pre-selected by the Provincial Meteorological Bureau to establish an astronomical observatory.

In October of the Meiji 42nd year, Naozo Ihoku, a lecturer at the Faculty of Science of Tokyo Imperial University, and Shinkichi Ogura, along with four others, climbed New High Mountain and made detailed surveys of the meteorology, geomagnetism, and geography of the area around the main peak and North Peak. At that time, the North Peak was selected as the site for the observatory. It was officially established in the 32nd year of the Republic of China and has been there for five years. There is now an official residence and an observation tower on North Peak. From the official residence to the tower, there is still a half-hour walk on the mountain. In addition to general astronomical instruments, the observation tower is equipped with a radio station for communication with the outside world.

Meteorological Water Source

The Meteorological Bureau has stationed six observers and ten laborers here, who are the only people within a dozen miles of the main peak and North Peak. They stand on the front lines of nature, fighting against wind, frost, rain, and snow, and preventing the intrusion of diseases and wild animals. For each of their three meals a day, they can only enjoy old canned food. Fresh vegetables are a rarity in the high mountains. The greatest lack here is water. After a few sunny days, they have to fetch water from several miles away, and sometimes even washing their faces becomes a problem. Only when it rains heavily can they take a refreshing bath. The workers are rotated every four months and given special allowances. After four months down the mountain, people no longer recognize them, as they resemble old monks in deep meditation in an ancient temple. The laborers are all indigenous compatriots from the high mountains. Only they can climb the steep mountain paths and withstand such a special climate and environment. They regularly transport supplies for the meteorological observatory, carrying thirty to forty catties and traversing trestle roads and dangerous bridges that are difficult for ordinary people to pass even with empty hands, and they are happy and accustomed to it.

Slate Composition

To climb New High Mountain, one must enter the mountain from the end of the Alishan mountain line, through Er-Yu, for thirty minutes to New High Mountain. The mountain road is rugged and dangerous. Below is a mountain lodge, which was originally the police station during the Japanese era, built at the foot of the New High main peak. Although it is said to be at the foot of the mountain, it is actually halfway up the mountain. Geologically speaking, the high mountain is composed of a slightly metamorphosed slate, which has undergone fairly complex folding. This slate is called the "Alishan Formation" and is a Tertiary marine sediment with a large original thickness. It was folded into mountains in the middle of the Tertiary period, like the famous peaks of the Alps and the Himalayas. Because its birth period is very short, it has not undergone erosion and still maintains its original height to some extent.

The island is still in autumn, but people never think that New High Mountain is immersed in winter all year round, with snow that the plains have never seen and cold that they have never felt. Would you feel strange? If you are willing to climb, you will definitely have a rich harvest. The only condition is "courage," "courage"!

### The Snobbery of Men of Letters

— Hu Shanyuan

Coincidentally, I heard the Kunqu operas "The Golden Seal" and the first part of "Rotten Ax Mountain," and sighed bitterly for Su Qin and Zhu Maichen. I sighed at how they, as men of letters, were neither literate nor martial, only knowing how to recite and study to death, suffering all kinds of mistreatment from their wives. Fortunately, they eventually had their days of success, retaliating against those two women and letting out a sigh of relief, which made us later generations, who worried about the ancients, feel relieved after hearing the second halves of those two operas. However, how can one not feel emotional after sighing? Throughout history, there have been far more men of letters who have been mistreated than just Su Qin and Zhu Maichen, and it seems that only they two were able to get their revenge. There must be countless others who died in anger, were angered to the point of being muddleheaded, angered to the point of getting sick, and angered to the point of having no joy in their lives. Pitiful are the men of letters!

However, I am puzzled. Since Su Qin and Zhu Maichen suffered so much snobbery, when they finally achieved success, they should have, in accordance with the principle of "measuring others by oneself," avoided treating others with snobbery. Why did they have to put on that act in front of those two ignorant women? Therefore, I want to say that Su Qin and Zhu Maichen were originally snobs and petty villains. They deserved to be mistreated when they were down on their luck, and there is no need to sympathize with them. Instead, we should ask about the two women who were sympathetic to them, because they were ignorant and should not be blamed too much! Those two men of letters, Su Qin and Zhu Maichen, were members of the superior intellectual class!

The intellectual class, men of letters, are supposed to be so refined, but they are so base and snobbish, which is truly cause for lament. And looking around, this is not only true since ancient times, but is even more intense today. Some spend all day running around the doors of famous scholars, hoping to become famous scholars themselves. Some, in public, fawn on some big shots, making every effort to flatter, to show that "the minister is deeply grateful to me." Some say nice things and write beautiful words, currying favor with people and gaining the support of certain people, posing as some kind of authority or some kind of great man blessed by fate. Some attend every gathering of famous people, and starting from those with only slight fame, do their best to win them over, shaking hands here and there, and laughing here and there, with the air of "all the heroes in the world are under my command." When he finally becomes a successful famous scholar or a great man, his influence becomes even greater: when someone asks him to write an article, he doesn't say he's busy or has no time, but says he's lazy and has no interest. Even if he writes, he is stingy with his ink, and only writes a few words. When someone invites him to dinner, he says he's busy with social engagements and can't spare the time, but when he arrives, before he's even had a few drinks and barely warmed his seat, he hurriedly gets up to leave, saying he has other engagements, and sneaks home to eat rice porridge, not caring at all. When unknown or young people come to see him, he can say he's not home, while at the same time, he has no problem welcoming those who are old, virtuous, and famous with open arms. Doctors with good sales, in his opinion, are the best books. Magazines with good sales are the best magazines, regardless of their content. Similarly, the work of an unknown writer, no matter how carefully structured it may be, if he is asked to teach, he may not even glance at it, or criticize it mindlessly, calling himself an expert. Of course, he has his own views: "Success is king, failure is villain." Things that no one wants are always bad. Therefore, in the publications he edits, there are only works by famous writers. Unsolicited manuscripts, as a rule, can be thrown into the wastebasket without even looking at them.

I suspect that they may be the Su Qin and Zhu Maichen of today—they have suffered mistreatment from others, so they are retaliating against others, or they may be even worse than Su Qin and Zhu Maichen, because those they retaliate against are often not the people who mistreated them in the first place. They are like adopted daughters-in-law who suffer mistreatment from their wicked mothers-in-law, and when the adopted daughters-in-law grow up, the wicked mothers-in-law have passed away and cannot be retaliated against, so they have no choice but to vent their anger on the next generation of adopted daughters-in-law, and they themselves inherit the mantle of the wicked mother-in-law. They are also like thieves who become watchmen, desperately fighting thieves to vent their anger from the days when they were beaten as thieves.

However, when I look at them, they are not Su Qin and Zhu Maichen after all. They may not have suffered mistreatment from others, and there is no need for them to retaliate against anyone. They are only acting out of a base mentality of clinging to the powerful and being self-important.

In fact, as a man of letters, one does not need to be snobbish with anyone. Who is not mistreated by booksellers and publishers? Who is not mistreated by wealthy merchants? Who is not mistreated by bureaucrats and politicians? Who is not mistreated by rogues and hooligans? Who is not subjected to all kinds of dirty air? Why insist on putting on airs and showing off one's power among one's own kind?

In this light, Su Qin and Zhu Maichen, with their grievances and debtors, are still sympathetic after all. Most of our modern men of letters are only disgusting and hateful.

Anecdotes of Writers

### Eroshan

— Shen Si

Eroshan was a famous Russian poet. In his early years, he visited China, but he was not clear about the practice of foot-binding among Chinese women. He once heard: "All Chinese people, including women, have bound feet." He couldn't see, so once, when Li Hongzhang, a diplomat of the late Qing Dynasty, went to Russia, this blind poet secretly went to touch Li Hongzhang's feet, but it turned out that they were not bound feet, but he was beaten badly.

### Remembrance

— By C.G. Rossetti (Ping Chou)

Remember me when I am gone away,
Gone far away into the silent land;
When you can no more hold me by the hand,
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
Remember me when no more day by day
You tell me of our future that you plann'd:
Only remember me; you understand
It will be late to counsel then or pray.

Yet if you should forget me for a while
And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
For if the darkness and corruption leave
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
Better by far you should forget and smile
Than that you should remember and be sad.

### Two or Three Things About Wen Tianxiang

— Tan Zhengbi

The Mystery of Madame Ouyang's Life and Death

After Tianxiang escaped from the tiger's mouth, he supported Prince Yi as emperor in Fu'an, serving as Right Chancellor and Commander-in-Chief of Jiangxi Military Affairs. In the Battle of Kongkeng, the entire army was defeated, and Tianxiang's wives, concubines, sons, and daughters were captured. He himself was fortunate enough to escape. The "Chronological Record of Mr. Wenshan, Annotated" states:

After the defeat at Kongkeng, the concubine inquired about the Duke's whereabouts and rushed to protect him. The Duke ordered five hundred soldiers to cut down trees and build a deer antler barrier. After a while, several wounded men arrived, indicating that the five hundred guards had collapsed and could not hold on. The Duke left immediately. The concubine, startled, asked the reason, and then saw the pursuing cavalry lined up in front. The concubine, along with Fo Sheng, Liu Xiaoniang, Huan Xiaoniang, Yan Ruren, Huang Ruren, etc., were all captured. The concubine intended to die in deep water or a dangerous house along the way, but the road was smooth. Upon arriving at the Yuan commander's residence, Fo Sheng was already missing. Someone must have loved his handsome appearance and raised him as their own son.

The "Chronological Record, Annotated" also records that the concubine later married Prince Gaotang with the princess and lived in Qizhen Temple in Fengzhou, Datong Road. In the second year of Dade, she was welcomed back to her ancestral home in the South by her adopted son, Sheng. She later died on the nineteenth day of the second month of the ninth year of Dade and was buried in Dongyuan, twenty miles south of Futian. According to this account, it is absolutely certain that the concubine did not die in battle after being captured. However, in "Wenshan Collection," Volume Fifteen, "The Collection of Sighs and Laments," there is "Lament for My Wife," which says:

A loyal woman does not marry a second husband, a loyal minister does not serve two masters. In heaven and on earth, only you and I! Alas!

This text was written in Yimao, two years after the concubine was captured. In a few words, it is both sad and self-respecting. At that time, Tianxiang was again occupied by the Yuan people and could not hear news of his concubine, so he would certainly not have moaned without illness. Therefore, the Qing scholar Bao Tingbo believed that the various books recording that the concubine was still alive after her death were mistaken because they mistakenly believed the account of Zhang Yifu's search for the concubine recorded in "Records of Song Loyalists." The modern scholar Ding Chuanjing believed that what Zhang Yifu was looking for were the concubine's remains, and said that Bao was misreading the original text of "Records of Song Loyalists." The official history also takes the person who collected Tianxiang's body as the concubine, mainly based on "Records of Song Loyalists." But it is unknown that both Liu Yueshen and Hu Guang's "Biography of Chancellor Wen" both take the body collectors as ten righteous men, and the "Gazetteer of the Capital's Scenery" also states:

The Ten Righteous Men of Jiangnan carried the Duke's body and buried it with medicine on the roadside five miles outside the Xiaonan Gate of the capital. In the second year of Dade, the adopted son, Sheng, arrived at Dushun City Gate and saw a woman weaving silk on a stone bridge, who was the Duke's old maid, Luhuo. Sheng spoke to her, and she returned and buried him in Luling.

Judging from the tone, the silk weaver seemed to be one of the Ten Righteous Men of Jiangnan. The official history takes the body collector as the concubine according to "Records of Song Loyalists." Doesn't this contradict this? Therefore, the death of the concubine is indeed a mystery. Perhaps when Tianxiang was captured, he heard rumors of his concubine's suicide, hence the writing of "Lament for My Wife," but the concubine had not actually died. But later, when Tianxiang was killed, he never received news of his concubine, so the text was not removed from the collection. But if the concubine could collect the body after Tianxiang's death, she would certainly have been able to communicate with Tianxiang when he was not yet dead. It can be seen that the collection of the body may not have happened. Therefore, it seems that one should follow the "Chronological Record, Annotated," that the concubine married the prince with the princess and was later welcomed back by her adopted son, which is more reasonable.

Tianxiang had one wife, two concubines, two sons, and six daughters, all of whom are mentioned in his own poems and writings. The preface to "Collected Du Poems," "Wife, One Hundred and Forty-Third," states:

On the seventeenth day of the eighth month of Dingchou, the defeat at Kongkeng, Madame Ouyang, daughters Liu Niang, Huan Niang, son Fo Sheng, Huan's biological mother Yan, Fo's biological mother Huang, were all lost. I heard that they were traveling north from Longxing. Only Fo Sheng had died.

The preface to "Eldest Son, One Hundred and Forty-Ninth," states:

I had two sons. The eldest, Daosheng, had a teachable nature. Unfortunately, due to the Xin Rebellion, he drifted with the family. In the defeat at Kongkeng, only he escaped and saved himself. He was loved by the Taidaren, and died of illness sixty days after the Taifuren in Huiyang Prefecture. He was thirteen years old.

The preface to "Two Daughters, One Hundred and Fiftieth," states:

I had six daughters. The eldest, Ding Niang, the second, Liu Niang, the third, Huan Niang, the fourth, Jian Niang, Jue Feng Niang, and Jue Shou Niang. In Bingzi, Ding Niang and Shou Niang died of illness in the Triangle of Heyuan. In Dingchou, Liu Niang and Huan Niang were captured. Only Jian Niang and Feng Niang survived. In the defeat at Chaoyang in Wuyin, they died again in the chaos of the soldiers.

A generation of loyal ministers, with their families destroyed and their sons dead, reached the extreme, which is extremely tragic! The "Chronological Record, Annotated" states:

Liu Xiaoniang followed the princess and married Zhao Wang Sha Jingzhou, and died during the Dade period. Huan Xiaoniang followed the princess and married Qi Wang Xi Ningzhou. The younger brothers and nephews were able to meet in the capital. In the Xin years of the Zhizheng period, it was still rumored that they were living in Shazhou to support the elderly, and they were all childless.

The so-called following in marriage meant treating them as concubines to accompany the marriage. Liu Niang and Huan Niang were daughters of Min, and now that the country was destroyed and their families ruined, this ending was not necessarily a matter of concern. Only the Yuan ruler treated Madame Duiyang as a concubine to accompany the princess, so the official history's record of his respect for Tianxiang is simply hypocrisy. At this time, the concubine's age was at least around forty, and they were still unwilling to let her live a chaste life, and did not treat her and her children as concubines to remarry. This was precisely the cruelest means of the enemy against captives. If Tianxiang knew underground, he would be gnashing his teeth even more.

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 168

— Ye Jingfeng

"I have a supplement," He Jian said with a smile, his tone seemingly protective, meaning Yaoxun. Regardless of whether they are under or over 20, this cannot be used as a completely certain proof. I myself have personally seen Japanese old ladies over the age of 80, whose legs and feet do not have the slightest Japanese characteristic; because they all grew up abroad and have never worn clogs... But I have a thought that you can criticize..." He Jian said at this point, laughing innocently, dissolving two-thirds of the tension caused by Mr. W. The air in the room was no longer so solemn.

"I would like to ask for some guidance on this," Yaoxun seemed particularly interested in this point.

"You know," He Jian's cheeks flushed again, "although they may not wear wooden clogs, but when they are at home, they cannot avoid learning to kneel and sit due to various customs. After kneeling and sitting for a long time, those ankles cannot help but change. In other words, those ankles must be flat, unlike those of women from other countries..." His face became even more flushed, "It cannot be said to be one hundred percent, there are still exceptions."

"Japanese women, Chinese women, or foreign women," I was a little unwilling to waste their time; "What do you all intend to do..."

"Yes..." Mr. W hurriedly straightened his expression, "I have made a plan. I plan to give them a warning tonight—to give their headquarters a surprise attack!"

"Oh!" This was He Jian's expression. Upon hearing Mr. W's proposal, he put his hands behind his back and walked back and forth in the room.

"Good!" Hu Chen and Yaoxun agreed in unison.

"After we're done, I'm going to go to Dongjiaominxiang with Brother Hu to find her," Yaoxun added.

I was fantasizing about the situation and consequences of the surprise attack and had no opinion for the time being. Yaoxun and Hu Chen had already expressed their opinions. Mr. W was still waiting for He Jian's reply, but He Jian was pacing back and forth, lost in thought. Just as it was silent, there was a gentle knock on the door.

"A letter." An off-duty employee gently pushed the door open and handed in a letter.

It was a regular envelope. As soon as I looked at the handwriting, I knew it was the farewell letter from Dingyuan that had just been mentioned. Receiving this letter, I hesitated a bit. I wanted to open it and read it immediately, but I was afraid of disturbing everyone's current focus—the surprise attack plan. Just as I was about to hide the letter in my pocket, He Jian suddenly brushed past me and turned back:

"Can you read it to us all? We are all very concerned about Mr. Wu. On the one hand, I also want to see how much of my guess is correct."

Four pairs of eyes in the room were focused on me and the letter in my hand. I had no reason to hesitate, so I immediately opened the letter:

"Senior Brother ××, My Brother—The other day, Mr. Shen came to the hospital on behalf of my brother to inquire. I am grateful for the kindness of my brothers and Miss Ji. I have also received many kinds of food and supplies, which I have gratefully accepted. What virtue do I have to receive such affection from my brothers? After the disaster, only a broken body remains, and I will not be able to repay it in this life. However, what I am always concerned about is: what happened to my wife and children, a total of six people? Who was the murderer? Where is the body buried? I am ill and my mind is blurred. I seem to remember asking my brother several times. My brothers are considerate and nuanced, afraid that the sick person will be sad, and make excuses to cover up. My brothers are also well-intentioned. I cannot rest in peace in my dreams without a reply. Fortunately, Mr. Shen came, and I begged on my knees in tears before I learned the whole story..."

Upon hearing this, He Jian let out a strange "Zha" sound; "This gang is really a bunch of idiots!" Then he mumbled a very vulgar Japanese curse word, which only I and Mr. W understood. Hu Cheng seemed not to understand the sentences in the letter, but seeing everyone's miserable unhappiness, he also somewhat understood, so he lowered his head very low. Yaoxun was already wiping his tears frequently, turning his back and looking out the window.

### The Great Feast of the Little People

— Jiayuan

In the past few days, the prices of gold, US dollars, white rice, and daily necessities have soared. In the speculative market, with the effort of raising a hand and taking a step, big and small "lucky ones" who sit and earn millions, tens of millions, and hundreds of millions of legal tender, after work, have to be lively again and celebrate again. So dance halls, restaurants, and theaters are crowded again. Fortunately, the cost is only hundreds of thousands of yuan, which is not much compared to the huge "profits" they have earned, so they can be "completely nonchalant." However, the general salaried class is crying out in pain due to rising prices. In reality, what the "lucky ones" dislike, eat, dance to, and watch all comes from the general public. This situation cannot be named anything else, but can only be named "The Great Feast of the Little People."

Shops are "drastically reduced," and the doors are deserted; shops are "drastically increased," and the doors are bustling. The reason is extremely mysterious. It is truly "a thousand years of economic events, gains and losses known in the heart."

European and American countries attach great importance to business methods. Shop assistants must be eloquent and make customers willing to take out their banknotes. To make a deal, it is truly a "painstaking effort." However, in China, this kind of "commercial philosophy" can be discarded like worn-out shoes. Didn't you see that when the price of rice sold for 170,000 to 80,000 yuan per stone a few days ago, it was impossible to buy rice at all? Even if you had "acquaintances," you had to "beg them earnestly."

"A thousand years of economic events, gains and losses known in the heart."

### Dying for Credentials

— Gu Yisheng

Having read the article in the tenth of this month's newspaper regarding He Fangling, a student at the Second Girls' Normal School of Hubei Province, being expelled for false credentials, leading to her running away and disappearing, I am filled with grief and indignation. I truly wonder why the government and society place such importance on credentials, not knowing how many genuinely talented and hardworking individuals they have stifled. Is it not enough to have a belly full of knowledge and a lifetime of skills as proof? Why must there be this piece of empty paper? Moreover, many people with credentials are just bundles of straw, utterly ignorant. Their credentials were not earned through learning but through time and money. They spend six years in middle school, paying tuition for twelve semesters, to get a middle school diploma. They spend four years in university, paying tuition for eight semesters, to get a university diploma. Alas, how many idle, young masters of wealthy families do we have in China?

The talent shortage in recent years is due to the declining standards of students, which in turn is due to the lax management of schools. In reality, it is all caused by credentials. In this environment that values superficiality over practicality, schools and institutions emphasize credentials to demonstrate their strict management and high standards. Those without credentials cannot enter higher education, as schools will not accept them, and they face societal scorn when seeking employment. Because credentials are so valuable, many diploma mills have sprung up. Although their curriculum may be tattered and dirty, their credentials are still useful. These diploma mills cater to the tastes of idle, young masters of wealthy families. They skip classes and cheat on exams, but as long as the tuition is paid, they can get a diploma to deceive the world, steal a reputation, and flaunt their status before the poor. On the other hand, decades of internal strife and external calamities have brought suffering to the people, with countless displaced and living in hardship, let alone attending school. However, many studious and ambitious individuals strive for academic success amidst hardship and adversity. But even if they have knowledge and skills, without credentials, they die prematurely in despair, "eliminated" by this "great era." It is truly heartbreaking to speak of!

Therefore, to cultivate genuine talent, raise student standards, and eliminate diploma mills, we must eradicate the malady of valuing superficiality over practicality. We must abolish credentials and adopt a rigorous and comprehensive examination system, so that both those from schools and those not from schools can compete fairly. Then those with genuine talent and skills will be able to stand out, and students in schools will strive for real learning instead of merely trying to obtain a diploma. Diploma mills will no longer dare to offer shoddy goods to the market. British education is renowned worldwide, and one does not necessarily need credentials to apply to university. Why does our country adopt this suicidal education system to destroy talent? Everyone knows that historically, great figures mostly came from poverty and studied hard from a young age. How many纨绔子弟 have lived up to expectations? To save these millions of buried talents, to save Chinese education, to save China, I respectfully implore the government and societal elites to urgently devise measures of assistance.

### A Timely Swindle

— Yuan Qinsun

A neighbor had a maid who had just come to Shanghai. Because gold prices had recently soared, she withdrew several months' wages in advance to buy a gold ring from a nearby jewelry store. Coincidentally, the store refused to sell that day due to the soaring gold prices and lack of inventory. As the maid exited, she encountered a man resembling a laborer in front of the store, who said to her: "You want to exchange for gold jewelry? I urgently need money. This ring on my finger weighs over three qian and I was just about to sell it. What price are you willing to offer? We can go into the store together to calculate it and then complete the transaction." The maid suspected it was fake, so she followed him into the store to distinguish the genuine from the fake. After entering the store and having it weighed, the maid further depreciated its value. The man appeared unwilling and turned to leave. After a few steps, he returned and said: "My wife is giving birth and urgently needs money. Moreover, the gold store is not accepting gold for exchange today, so I can only bear the pain and sell it to you at a discount." He then took off the ring, accepted the money, and left. The maid suspected nothing. After returning home and telling her employer, the employer found it strange that it was so cheap and examined the ring, only to discover it was a brass ring. The maid then realized that when the seller turned his back, he had switched the ring. The naive country bumpkin, greedy for petty gains, was crestfallen.

### Various Experiments on Standing Eggs Upright

— Zhu Qingtong

Regarding the matter of eggs being able to stand upright, the author and friends have conducted various experiments, with some new discoveries.

Raw eggs can of course stand upright, but some cooked eggs are easier to stand upright than raw eggs. Some people believe that eggs stand upright because the air density is particularly high on the day of the Start of Spring. The author has tried burning fire around eggs standing upright to reduce air density, but the eggs still stood upright without change. Probably this matter has nothing to do with density.

The author then used a small hook to remove a portion of the rounded top of the raw egg, mixed the egg white and yolk, and tried it without a lid. It also succeeded in standing upright!

After we removed the egg yolk and egg white, we carefully sealed the cut section with egg white membrane to form an empty egg, with nothing inside. Then we tried to stand it upright again, holding it with both hands on the floor. It only took a minute, and it stood upright! Later, we didn't even need a minute. Standing an empty egg upright is easier than standing a raw or cooked egg.

Based on the above experiments, it can be concluded that the uprightness of an egg is probably purely a matter of the center of gravity in physics. If the center of gravity is perpendicular to a point, then it can stand upright at any time, and this is not only true for eggs. What thoughts would the great scientist Einstein have after seeing this? He wouldn't dismiss it as "nonsense" anymore, would he?

### The Recently Sentenced Nazi Photographer

— Mai Ye

Last month, the 31st, a Reuters dispatch from Munich said: "Hitler's personal photographer, Hoffmann, has been sentenced to ten years of hard labor and deprived of civil rights for life by the 'German Nazi Purge Court'; all private property, except for a few reserves, has been confiscated." Although the telegram is very simple, we are not entirely unfamiliar with Hoffmann and his works.

A sympathetic painter said very interestingly: "Hitler's facial features are 'cartoonish,' Roosevelt's facial features are 'photographic,' and Churchill's facial features are 'painterly'..." The three terms are used somewhat abstractly, but in fact they are not without basis. Recalling the world political cartoon scene before the end of World War II, who was more in the limelight than "Hitler," this typical buffoon?

Hoffmann's contribution and merit to the Nazis seem to lie in his ability to "artistically" transform Hitler's "cartoonish" facial features into "photographic" ones. If Dr. Goebbels was Hitler's loudspeaker, then Hoffmann was his slide projector. Through this lens, Hitler deceived hundreds of millions of Nazi followers' eyes, just as he deceived hundreds of millions of Nazi followers' ears through Goebbels' loudspeaker. Compared to Goebbels, ten years of hard labor is too cheap.

In the common sense of ordinary people, photography is the most faithful record; but with skillful manipulation, the extent of its deception is unsurpassed. For example, Hitler was a bloodthirsty tyrant, but Hoffmann selected many shots, recording Hitler's artificial state of intimacy while holding an infant less than one year old. Hitler was a highly neurotic "madman," but Hoffmann photographed him as a solemn portrait. Germans still cannot count how many Nazi worshippers used Hoffmann's "masterpiece" as a "catalyst" back then.

Americans believe that the photos of the late Roosevelt were the most widely circulated, but the numbers prove that they are less than half of Hitler's. And Hitler's photos were entirely handled by Hoffmann.

Nazi Germany had many stamps with Hitler's portrait as the design, and without exception, these were also Hoffmann's works.

If we are not forgetful, we should remember the big news of the Olympic World Games held in Berlin more than ten years ago. At that time, the broadcasting rights for all news photos and motion pictures at the venue were handled by Hoffmann. He was not only a photographer and a skilled portrait photographer, but also a good filmmaker. He often suggested building a deep trench next to the track, parallel to the track from the starting point to the finish line, but only the camera lens was exposed above the ground to capture the runners' running posture, without obstructing the view of the audience and judges. The camera and photographer were placed on a high-speed car, moving under the deep trench. This plan was realized, and many shots were very moving. This news film was shown in various countries and in Shanghai.

But we cannot forget the enchanting actress White Braun, who acted as a line-puller between Hitler and Hoffmann. People sometimes say that Hoffmann was introduced and reused by Hitler's mistress; but there is another saying that Hoffmann often "pimped" for Hitler. Who would have known that the Nazi demon king, who appeared to be "asexual," also had romantic affairs in the harem? It is difficult for anyone to determine which of the two sayings is true, but Hoffmann's involvement in Old Hee's love affairs seems beyond doubt. It is a pity that we did not see Hoffmann's records of the colorful hours of love and life.
