### Resource Committee Plans to Develop Coal Mines in Central and Southern China; Requires 80 Billion, Requests Additional Funding from the Executive Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] According to an investigation by the Resource Committee, the coal mines in Central and Southern China that are suitable for development include the Xuanlu Coal Mine south of Luoyang in Henan, the Ganxi Coal Mine in Pingxiang, Jiangxi, the Xiangyong Coal Mine in Yongxing, and the Nanling Coal Mine in northern Guangdong. All of these meet the conditions for mining and are currently being mined on a small scale. However, if mechanical equipment is strengthened and work is intensified from now, daily production can reach 2,800 tons by the end of this year, with gradual increases to 5,800 tons per day by the end of next year, or approximately 180,000 tons per month. By the end of the following year, monthly production can reach 400,000 tons.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] The Resource Committee believes that the coal used by the industries and transportation businesses in major cities in southeastern China mostly relies on coal produced in the Northeast and North China. However, the coal sources in the Northeast and North China are dwindling daily. Although Taiwan can supply 80,000 tons of coal per month, it is still insufficient to meet the needs of Shanghai alone, resulting in a significant loss of foreign exchange due to overseas purchases. Therefore, the committee has formulated measures to strengthen the development of coal mines in Central and Southern China, requiring a budget of 81.85 billion yuan. This has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and additional funding. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has referred it to the Budget Review Committee for examination.

(2) Regarding measures for miners' exemption (deferment) from military service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is requested to consult with the Ministry of National Defense to appropriately expand the scope of draft deferment for miners. (3) Regarding the crackdown on private kilns, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is requested to consult with local governments to strictly enforce crackdowns. Other issues such as coal mine taxes and work competitions were also decided concretely. After the discussions, a closing ceremony was held around 1 p.m. Minister Chen delivered a speech, expressing that the government would adopt the requests made by the representatives of various mines and hoped that the mines could strive to produce and fulfill their due mission. After the closing ceremony, the Resource Committee hosted a luncheon for the attending representatives. After the meeting, reporters interviewed representatives from various mines, who expressed satisfaction with the conference and believed that with the assistance of the government, they would be able to achieve the goal of increasing production.

### Lei Zhen Discusses the Japan Question; Provides Commentary on Four Aspects: Politics, Economics, Education, and Law; All Elements of Aggression Should Be Abolished or Corrected

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] Lei Zhen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Political Council, spoke to reporters on the 3rd about various issues related to dealing with Japan. Lei studied at Tokyo Imperial University and has a deep understanding and considerable research on Japan. He believes that the following principles should guide the handling of the Japan question: (1) The attitude towards Japan should be based on the spirit of "not dwelling on old grievances and transforming enemies into friends" as proclaimed by Chairman Chiang. Be lenient towards things that are suitable for the peaceful life and reasonable needs of the Japanese people, and be strict towards things that could enable Japan to recover and retaliate. (2) Utilize enlightened Japanese figures to control Japanese education and utilize Japanese technicians in various departments to accelerate China's industrialization. He then provided commentary on four aspects: politics, economics, education, and law. Regarding political issues, he believes that all efforts should be made to promote the collapse of the Japanese emperor system and the entire imperial family. In particular, the position of the emperor must be revised in the Japanese constitution. Secondly, the ideas of divine right and Bushido spirit should be thoroughly eradicated. Furthermore, the Japanese police system, as a tool to assist the Japanese government in enslaving the people and controlling their thoughts and lives, should also be thoroughly reformed. Regarding economic issues, Lei believes that heavy industry and military-related industries should be completely abolished, and the dismantled machinery and equipment should mostly be used as part of the reparations to China. Light industry should be strictly limited, and machinery and equipment beyond the limit should also be used as part of the reparations to China. The textile industry can be allowed to exist as much as possible, but it should not hinder the development of China's light industry. At the same time, the Japanese land system should also be explicitly stipulated in the peace treaty and thoroughly reformed. Lei mentioned several points regarding education: (1) Most of the Japanese vocational schools and universities are actually designed and researched institutions for external aggression and should be reorganized separately. (2) The textbooks used in Japanese primary and secondary schools should be thoroughly revised. (3) Military training in universities and secondary schools and military management in primary school physical education should be thoroughly revised. (4) All levels of military schools and public and private organizations with military significance should be abolished. Lei believes that many Japanese laws contain anti-democratic and aggressive clauses and should be revised or deleted accordingly. Lei emphasized that China and Japan should follow the path of genuine friendship in the future to achieve the ideal of Pan-Asianism advocated by Sun Yat-sen.

[United Press, Dihua, 2nd Dispatch] After a Chinese Air Force C-47 aircraft went missing between Hami and Lanzhou on the 31st of last month, there has been no news of its whereabouts.

Chinese Air Force officials stated that if the aircraft landed in the Gobi Desert, the 26 passengers on board would have a better chance of survival, but if it landed in the mountains, the chances of survival would be slim.

### U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission Releases Figures on Surplus Supplies Shipped to China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd Dispatch] The U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission recently released its quarterly report on handling foreign affairs, stating that during the quarter ending June 30, and previously, the surplus supplies provided by the United States to the Chinese government totaled approximately 100,000 tons. This amount accounts for approximately 35% of the total surplus supplies that China can obtain from the United States. As of now, the cost of the U.S. surplus supplies obtained by China is approximately $170 million. The report stated that the Chinese government was only able to begin large-scale transportation of these supplies in the quarter from April to June because the Chinese government had signed contracts with several civil aviation ships to assist in transportation and had established camps on several major islands to facilitate loading operations. In the near future, the United States will announce surplus supplies worth $550 million, most of which have been sold to the Chinese and Philippine governments under wholesale agreements. It is expected that shipping measures within China can be completed within six days. The report also stated that in connection with the sale of these surplus supplies, the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission has begun a plan to acquire real estate in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Ping (Beijing). The United States is currently discussing with the Chinese government how to acquire certain real estate to supply embassies and other institutions for office space and staff dormitories. The United States may also acquire some good real estate in China as part of the compensation for shipping surplus supplies to China. In the past quarter, the cost of the property declared as surplus supplies was approximately $10 billion, of which 81% has been processed, but the selling price is only 23% of the cost.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 3rd Dispatch] A Korean trade delegation, led by Lee Kim-beom, Director of the Korea Trade Bureau of the Import and Export Department, and Kim Tae-dong, Salt Affairs Commissioner of the Finance Bureau, arrived here yesterday. The mission of the delegation is to inspect the economic situation in China and Hong Kong in order to promote Sino-Korean trade.

Kim discussed the situation in South Korea, saying that South Korea is different from North Korea, and currently all aspects are progressing smoothly under the guidance of the US military authorities. The government that is currently striving for complete independence in South Korea is still a provisional government. In order to promote trade between Korea and South China when necessary, the South Korean government plans to "establish a commercial office" in Hong Kong.

He expressed regret over the current war in China, but he firmly believes that China can overcome the difficulties and become a stabilizing factor in the Far East.

### Recent Measures of the Jiangsu Provincial Government; Strengthen Security, Promote Conscription and Taxation; Clear Land Rights, Implement Rent Reduction in the Pacification Area

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] Zhang Yulin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Information Office, held a reception for reporters in Nanjing at 6:00 p.m. on the 3rd to report on the political situation in Jiangsu Province. He stated that after the victory, among the 63 counties and cities in Jiangsu Province, only the areas south of the Yangtze River were relatively stable, and no villages in northern Jiangsu were completely integrated. Although the general situation after the complete recovery of northern Jiangsu was not ideal, it was still somewhat gratifying to the people after the tragic experience. The Jiangsu Provincial Civil Affairs Department is working hard to organize and promote household registration and military service. It is also paying particular attention to clarifying officialdom, eradicating corruption, and improving grassroots political organizations. The strict prohibition of opium and the preparation for elections are also actively underway. In terms of finance, the central government approved a budget of over 34.9 billion yuan in revenue and over 51.2 billion yuan in expenditure for this year, with a shortfall of 16.2 billion yuan, which will be supplemented by the central government. However, the actual expenditure difference is still large, and the adjustment of tax rates is the only way to remedy this. The finances of various counties and cities are extremely difficult, with deficits exceeding 30%, which is a serious problem. In terms of education, there are four provincial-level vocational schools and above, fifteen high schools, eight normal schools and rural teachers' schools each, and approximately 206 other county-level private secondary schools. There are 9,539 national schools, with approximately 100,000 secondary school students and 930,318 primary school students. Before the war, there were approximately 30,000 secondary school students, and the current increase is three times that. In terms of construction, 1,600 kilometers of highways were repaired this year, 77 bridges were newly built or repaired, and 3,349 meters of seawall were built, using over 10,000 zhang of piles. In terms of security, regional suppression is currently being implemented, and the provincial security force has been increased by four regiments, doubling the original force. In terms of land and grain, 3,903,249 shi dan (approx. 100 kg) have been collected from 38 counties, including Tongshan and Jiangning, in 1946, which is approximately 75%. This year, the Executive Yuan approved the payment of 1.2 shi dou (approx. 12.5 kg) of actual grain per yuan, with a collection of one part and a loan of half a part. Last year, in addition to the 30% allocated to the central government, Jiangsu Province purchased 800,000 dan of grain, which exceeded the limit. In terms of land administration, emphasis is placed on the handling of land in the Subei Pacification Area and the implementation of a general land rights clearance. Currently, the countermeasures in the recovered area of Subei are to prohibit retaliation, chasing rent, and evicting tenants, and to implement a 37.5% rent reduction. Dongtai, Xinghua, Huaiyin, and Suqian, which are designated as the Sixth Administrative Region, have been designated as experimental counties for the implementation of the central government's land treatment regulations. Regarding social affairs, health, personnel, training, accounting, and statistics, Zhang also provided detailed reports. Zhang continued: After the recent promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, equal emphasis is placed on suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Jiangsu Province's future work will focus on three points: (1) Stabilizing Subei and consolidating Jiangnan. Local forces have been gradually strengthened. (2) Conscription will begin on August 7, combining conscription and voluntary enlistment. (3) Military food and civilian food will be planned and considered together, with a collection of one part and a loan of half a part, which may begin on September 1. In addition, due to the break in the Muhe River, the Xu-Hai area has become a vast expanse of water. It is hoped that the central government will allocate more relief funds to save the disaster victims.

### Fellow Qinghai Natives in Nanjing Welcome Xirao Jiacuo

### Wedemeyer Special Envoy's Mission is to Explore Ways to Aid China

[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The United States' intentions towards China will not be known until Special Envoy Wedemeyer returns home. Officials revealed that Wedemeyer's delegation to China was not only appointed to investigate the general situation in China but also to bring back correct methods for presentation to President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall so that they can provide possible assistance to the Chinese government. It is expected that the United States will attempt again to engage with senior Soviet leaders within the next week or ten days to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the organization of a provisional government for all of Korea.

Well-informed sources told United Press that action is expected before Marshall leaves Washington for Brazil on August 11 to attend the Pan-American Conference. The United States' action may be to send another note to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Although U.S. officials have refused to disclose the contents, it may be to draw Molotov's attention to the fact that negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in Korea have reached a hopeless stalemate between the commanders of the two countries' forces. It is necessary to take decisive steps at the senior leadership level of the two countries. It is expected that the United States will draw Molotov's attention to his statement that he sent a letter to Marshall earlier this year suggesting that senior officials from both countries review the situation in Korea. Molotov suggested that this review be given to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission for another chance.

### Northeast Facing New Crisis: An Economic Observer Discusses the Northeast Situation

[Central News Agency, this city] The inspection group led by U.S. President's Special Envoy General Wedemeyer is about to go to the Northeast for an on-the-ground investigation. It is generally predicted that Mr. Wedemeyer will obtain extremely detailed and valuable information in that area to assist in the preparation of his report. Recently, an economic observer who has just returned from the Northeast stated, "The Northeast is currently facing a new crisis. This crisis has been gradually exposed since the Japanese surrender. The people of the Northeast now universally recognize the importance of national self-salvation and will not compromise with any external coercion. Therefore, the future development of the situation deserves serious attention. We hope that General Wedemeyer will be able to gather more information to assist in the review of 'Stabilizing the Northeast means stabilizing Asia, and stabilizing Asia means stabilizing the world,' which will greatly contribute to world peace."

The Process of Taking Over and Reorganizing

Referring to the process of taking over and reorganizing the Northeast, he stated, "The Northeast was the base where the Japanese bandits used the Chinese to control the Chinese and used war to support war. They painstakingly managed it for more than ten years, and various economic constructions were quite impressive. To name a few major ones, such as the Shenyang arsenal and the Tiexi industrial zone, the Xiaofengman hydroelectric power plant in Jilin, the Dalong Science Academy in Changchun, the agricultural experiment station in Gongzhuling, the reclamation fields in Panshan, the fruit orchards in Xiong Yue, and the coal and iron mines in Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Anshan, very few industrial and mining enterprises in the country can match them. After the Japanese surrender, the government immediately issued an order to organize the Northeast Headquarters, redividing the provinces into Liaoning, Andong, Liaobei, Jilin, Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, and Xing'an, nine provinces, and announced the personnel of the nine provinces and two cities to engage in takeover work. After the takeover personnel from various departments arrived in Changchun one after another on October 9th of the 34th year of the Republic, the Soviet army's attitude repeatedly changed and did not transfer the administration of the occupied areas to our government in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. They repeatedly postponed the withdrawal of troops, and at the same time, illegal elements were able to take the opportunity to organize armed forces, expand their power, and implement local separatism, hindering the takeover. It was not until the Soviet army withdrew in March of the 35th year of the Republic that, following the progress of the National Army, the takeover work was successively launched from Jinzhou to Shenyang, Siping, Changchun, Jilin, and then to Suhe, Andong. In addition, the two cities of Harbin and Dalian, and the five provinces of Songjiang, Nenjiang, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Xing'an, are still awaiting takeover. Before the government took over, some of the enemy's and puppet's remaining industrial and mining equipment, important materials, and the inherent property of the people of the Northeast were transported away by the Soviet army, and some were brutally destroyed by the communist bandits. The old essence, the remaining is less than 40%. According to the Pauley Mission report, the direct damage suffered by factories in the Northeast during the Soviet occupation period reached US$858,000,000. If the repair costs are included in the estimate, it should be at least US$2 billion. At present, the Shenyang arsenal, Fushun coal mine, Anshan iron mine, Xiaofengman power plant (no investigation has been conducted in the unreclaimed provinces). The Benxihu Coal and Iron Company, etc., now retain only old machinery and dilapidated factory buildings. After the government took over, in terms of economy, special emphasis was placed on rebuilding the general economic order, regulating prices, striving to restore production, and stabilizing people's lives. The important work is described below:

A. Financial Aspect: The Central Bank issued circulation notes in the nine northeastern provinces and used them at the same value as puppet Manchukuo banknotes. However, before the issuance of the circulation notes, the National Army, in order to cope with various expenses, had affixed the seal of the Northeast Security Commander's Office to the legal currency it carried, commonly known as "stamped legal currency," and used it at the same value as the puppet Manchukuo banknotes. After the issuance of the circulation notes, the currency system began to be reorganized: (1) Reorganization of Soviet military tickets: The measures for the reorganization of Soviet military tickets were promulgated in August of the 35th year of the Republic, and the registration of Soviet military tickets began on September 9th, and all of them were cashed in. After September, the newly recovered valley areas re-established supplementary registration measures on October 15th, and the work of redemption is also being promoted with the advancement of the military. (2) Reorganization of puppet Manchukuo banknotes: The method of only accepting but not issuing was adopted. As of the end of December of the 35th year of the Republic, 4,645,329,460 yuan of puppet Manchukuo banknotes had been secretly recovered, accounting for approximately 34.3% of the total amount issued. Official statistics have not been obtained since the 36th year of the Republic. Except for those below 50 yuan, puppet Manchukuo banknotes have disappeared from the market, and circulation notes have become the only currency in general circulation in the Northeast. (3) Reorganization of "stamped legal currency": Most of it had been recovered by the end of January of the 36th year of the Republic.

Regarding the opening of remittance, on the one hand, remittances were organized for government employees to support their families, and on the other hand, "Implementation Measures for Industrial and Commercial Remittances" were promulgated to benefit merchants and residents. The exchange rate between circulation notes and legal currency was initially 1:13, and then changed to 1:11.5 and 1:12.5. For the past year, prices in the Northeast have always been lower than those within the customs, which cannot but be attributed to the issuance of circulation notes and the proper management of exchange rates. The next is the management of the financial market, strictly prohibiting gold transactions. Since July of the 35th year of the Republic, the government has publicly announced the prohibition of gold and foreign exchange trading, inspecting gold shops and silver buildings on the one hand, and rewarding people for reporting black markets on the other hand, and it has disappeared. In addition, the government, such as supporting the development of industrial and mining enterprises, has organized a large number of industrial loans. The banks have overdrawn 2 billion yuan for the 19 state-owned industrial and mining production units established by the Resources Committee in the Northeast. For the support of small and medium-sized industries, the "Draft Measures for Joint Loans for Small and Medium-sized Industries by Commercial Banks" has been promulgated, and the loaned factories and mines have benefited greatly.

At 11:30, Mr. Wedemeyer and his economic advisor Walker walked around the circular path of the U.S. Consulate for several laps, holding a secret talk for a quarter of an hour. After lunch at the consulate, he met with Hu Lin at 2:40 p.m. for a half-hour talk, discussing general issues extensively. At 3:10 p.m., he met with Professor Qian Duansheng of Peking University, and the talk lasted for 40 minutes. After Mr. Hu and Mr. Qian left, he continued to talk with political advisor Sprus. Mr. Wedemeyer continued to meet with Yu Xinqing, chairman of the Design Committee of the Baoding Pacification Office, and Bishop Tian Linji, Dr. Lux, representative of the Luo's China Aid Fund, and Rigney, dean of studies of Fu Jen Catholic University. At the same time, Gan Jiehou, Liu Hangchen, and Pu Xinyu also had contact with the mission. According to Pu Xinyu, he told Mr. Wedemeyer that the compatriots in the Northeast absolutely support the central government and appreciate the United States' assistance to China. In addition, a large number of visitors who wished to submit information to the mission were received by Mr. Wedemeyer's advisors for a long time. At 6:00 p.m., Mr. Wedemeyer and U.S. Consul Freeman went to the Beixinqiao Presbyterian Church, where they were accompanied by Pastor Melvin and Dr. Feng Ji to visit the church and hospital for half an hour. At 9:00 p.m., the mission attended a banquet hosted by Li Zongren at the Zhongnan Nursing Administration Hall, with Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, He Siyuan, Hu Shi, Mei Yiqi, and others as companions. It is said that Li specially prepared Peking roast duck, a delicacy of Beiping, for the mission. Mr. Wedemeyer and the members are scheduled to go to Tianjin tomorrow morning, then to Shenyang and Qingdao, and return to Nanjing on the weekend.

[United Press, Beiping, 3rd] He Siyuan, Mayor of Peiping, issued a statement on the 3rd regarding the Wedemeyer special mission's visit to North China, stating that China has reached a point where it must choose between democracy or communism. Those with knowledge naturally support democracy, because communism is not suitable for China. When China asks for American assistance, it is not asking the United States to directly suppress the communists. However, for the sake of the people's interests, we must eliminate communism, which contains international complexities. We tried to eliminate the communists before the war, but now we are forced to do so. Mayor He also emphasized that there is no real anti-American sentiment in China. The people are very grateful for the supplies of the UNRRA, and they understand that they come from the United States. He also pointed out that China needs sound administration and admits that it has made some mistakes and cannot make the country move towards the ideal authentic democracy.

### Communist Bandits in Western Shandong are Rats in a Sack, Remnants Near Linpu Gathering for Annihilation, Sweep in Pingbao Area Expected to Have New Developments

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 3rd] Remnants of the 1st and 7th columns of Liu Bocheng's communist bandit troops and independent brigades were captured by the National Army southeast of Linpu and are being annihilated. The National Army is dividing into multiple routes to encircle and suppress the remnants of the bandits in the northwest and southwest areas of Ningyang. The remaining communist bandits in western Shandong have become rats in a sack.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] The communist bandit Liu Bocheng attempted to obstruct the government's restoration of the Yellow River levee. He concentrated the remnants of his 1673rd column and launched a fierce attack on the National Army's river defense and levee restoration troops in Linpu on the 2nd. The National Army fought bravely to block the attack and is currently engaged in fierce fighting.

[Our newspaper, Yanzhou, 3rd] After Chen Yi's 8th and 10th columns merged with the 1st and 2nd columns and the 13th Division in the triangular area of Jining, Dongping, and Dakou, the former, starting on the 1st, attempted to flee eastward across the Jinpu Line via Xiteng Village Store, Ge Shizhuang, southwest of Nanyi. The latter fled to the outskirts of Yanzhou via Nanji Set (southeast of Jining) and Hongmiao (east of Ershilipu) on the 1st. The National Army's pursuit forces are continuing to encircle and suppress them. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's five columns, including the 6th column, are still surrounded by the National Army in Wenshangji, north of Chengwu. The 3rd column is in Dushanj, south of Juye, and the 7th column is in Tangchakou, near Jinxiang. As for the 3rd and 2nd columns, they fled to Linu Kou and Linpu on the 1st to prevent the National Army's levee restoration project, and fierce fighting broke out again.

[Our newspaper, Yanzhou, 3rd] The four-corner area of ​​Ningyang, Nanyi, Jining, and Yanzhou is the scene of fierce fighting, and the Xuzhou-Zhacun section of the Jinpu Road has been temporarily suspended.

[Our newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] The National Army in Linqu continued to sweep outwards on the 2nd. The pursuit force on the southern route has crossed Xinzai and approached Jiangyu.

[Our newspaper, Jinan, 2nd] The bandits who collapsed from Linqu in three routes, in addition to the more than two columns to Gaoai, Jiangyu, Liushanzhai in the southeast of the city and the Zhuquan in the northwest, and the main force of more than four columns who collapsed to Yidu, had already fled north across the Jiaoji Line on the 1st, and the National Army is continuing to pursue and suppress them. The vanguard has reached the vicinity of Yidu two days ago.

[Our newspaper, Baoding, 3rd] The National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Line is redeploying its forces. The Hebei China National Army is being transferred north to the periphery of Baoding. Currently, the National Army has divided and transferred its forces from Qingfengdian to Dongchangshou on the Baoshi section. It is generally predicted that the National Army in the west of Baoding and the triangular area of ​​Ping, Jin, and Bao will launch another encirclement and suppression campaign against the bandits. In addition, the National Army in the northern section of the Jinpu Line continued to cross Yaoguantun southwards. Thousands of bandits in the suburbs of Cangxian resisted fiercely.

[Our newspaper, Tianjin, 3rd] The front line in the northern section of Jinpu is quiet, and there will be no major changes within the day. Currently, the National Army is engaged in the consolidation work in Jin County and Jinghai. Military officials said that the National Army has new plans for the sweep battle in the Ping, Jin, and Bao areas, and there will be new developments.

### Communist Bandits Plot to Dig the Yellow River Banks, Army Headquarters Lists Ironclad Evidence, People Launch Movement to Defend Their Hometowns and Save the Country

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] Wu Yizhou, director of the Press Office of the Xuzhou Command of the Army Headquarters, recently made a statement on the communist bandits' preparation to dig the levee between Jiucheng and Xunko as follows: After the communist bandits Liu Bocheng led his troops, including the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th columns, to cross the Yellow River and disturb western Shandong, they suffered severe blows from the National Army and strong resistance from the people in various places. They were repeatedly defeated and suffered heavy casualties. In order to save their fate of being completely eliminated and to cover up the shame of their defeat, they are actively deploying to dig the levee, attempting to inundate the south bank. However, in order to shirk responsibility for this crime, they spread propaganda in advance, falsely claiming that the National Army planned to dig the levee and breach it. For example, on July 29, the communist bandits' Handan Broadcasting Station broadcasted that when Liu's bandits were preparing to breach the levee in the Haozhai area west of Dongming, they instead claimed that it was done by the National Army's 558th Regiment. Their intention to reverse right and wrong and deceive the people is obvious. Their obstruction of the government's levee repair and river protection project is even more numerous. For example, in the upper part of July, liaison personnel working between Wuzhi and Juancheng and Puyang were shelled by the bandits on the north bank and had to withdraw to Kaifeng. On July 31, the communist bandits' Handan Broadcasting Station broadcasted a statement in mid-July by the pseudo-Jinji Luyu Liberated Area Democratic Government, saying: "Our side (the bandits' self-proclaimed) has entered a state of total military mobilization. We hope that liaison personnel will no longer come to the liberated area, otherwise they will not be protected." It also broadcasted news that "the Zhu Kou Engineering Third Team of the Shandong Flood Prevention Office of the government has been completely oppressed by us and retreated to the vicinity of Gaocun and Maodian, and the engineering materials stored by the team have been completely robbed back to the north bank of the Yellow River," etc. All of these are ironclad evidence of the communist bandits obstructing the government's levee restoration project. Currently, it is the season of great flooding, the water level is rising sharply, and the levees everywhere are in danger. Our repair personnel are rushing to work day and night to protect the levees, but Liu's bandits do not care about the hundreds of millions of people on the south bank. They have gathered the 1st, 6th, and 7th columns to encircle and attack our levee restoration troops stationed in Linpu and attack and rob repair workers everywhere. At the same time, they have dug three channels to draw the river in the area between Jiucheng and Dongkou, preparing to breach the levee. Now the people of Caoshu counties in southwestern Shandong have abandoned their land and thoroughly recognized the crimes of the communist bandits, and have risen up in rebellion one after another, launching a movement to resist the communist bandits and defend their hometowns and save the country.

### Downstream Water Level of the Yellow River Rises, Jinan Laborers Go Up the Levee to Guard

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] The Yellow River's flood season has arrived, and the downstream river water has suddenly increased.

The Jinan district laborers' flood prevention team has begun to go up the levee to guard it to ensure safety.

### Continuing Floods in Southern Guangxi

Zheng Ruogu Returns to Capital Today to Report

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 3rd] Zheng Ruogu, a counselor from the Ministry of Social Affairs who was sent to Guangdong and Guangxi to inspect the disaster situation, recently returned from his inspection in southern Guangxi and said: The disaster situation in that area is indeed very serious. Since January, the rain has not stopped, and the disaster situation is still continuing. Currently, the cities of Nanning and Guixian are still submerged by the flood. According to statistics, the average annual rainfall in Nanning in the past five years is only over 1,200 centimeters, while the rainfall in June of this year was 536 centimeters. The rainfall in one month almost accounts for half of the annual rainfall, so the severity of the flood can be imagined. Moreover, the flood occurred at a time when a bumper harvest was expected, and all the crops were washed away by the flood. Mr. Zheng is scheduled to return to the capital on the 4th to report.

### Jin Experiencing Summer Autumn Weather

### Narcotics Smuggled South from Communist Bandit Area in Songbei

Changchun Authorities Issue Strict Prevention Orders

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The first batch of "Little White Flower" opium north of the Songhua River has now matured and is being escorted by communist bandits to southern Songhua for sale. In several bandit dens on both sides of southern Songhua, the communist bandits have set up opium exchanges to seize materials and circulation notes from the government's territory with narcotics. It is estimated that one bolt of cotton cloth or one bundle of cotton can be exchanged for three to four taels of opium. The military and police here have paid close attention to this. In addition to ordering the troops stationed in southern Songhua to strictly prevent the transportation of narcotics from the bandit area to the south, they have also launched a drug eradication campaign among the military and civilians in the city.

After arriving at Yangliuqing Dong Station at 2:00 p.m., they were immediately escorted on foot to a certain military headquarters. Citizens lined the streets to watch, and the whole city was stirred up. Due to the communist army's guerrilla warfare, it was rare for large numbers to be captured in the past. The large number of prisoners this time proves the heavy blows suffered by the communist army. Among this batch of prisoners, there are many important communist bandit cadres, and the military department will conduct detailed interrogations.

### Northeast Facing New Crisis The Above Article Continues from the First Page

B. Industry and Mining: The government's reorganization of heavy industry, centered on the Resources Committee, particularly emphasizes the resumption and increased production of coal and electricity. Major mines resuming operation include Fuxin, Fushun, Xi'an, Beipiao, Benxi Lake, Yantai, Yingchengzi, etc. Although small mines in other areas are managed by responsible authorities, their output is minimal, only sufficient to meet local needs. The output of major mines is also limited, due to equipment damage and insufficient raw material and power supply, reaching only one-fourth to one-tenth of the output during the puppet Manchukuo period. The total output in October of the 35th year was 360,000 metric tons, and the total output for the entire 35th year was 1.6 million tons. Power generation enterprises with larger scales include Jilin (hydropower), Fushun, Xi'an, and Beipiao (thermal power). In the past, the power generation capacity was 2.5 million kilowatts, but the current power generation is only one-fifth of the past. The power generated by other power plants in Anshan and Benxi Lake is mostly used for local mining needs. In addition to coal and electricity, industries such as iron and steel manufacturing, non-ferrous metal industry, machinery industry, electrical appliance industry, chemical industry, kerosene industry, and cement industry have either resumed production and increased output, or are urgently planning for restoration. The progress of their work has not stopped for a single day.

The government's reorganization of light industry is centered on the Production Management Bureau. The bureau has taken over more than 1,000 factory units, but due to restrictions on raw materials, transportation, technology, and other conditions, it has not been able to fully restore operations. As of recently, only 59 factories have resumed operation. The bureau will divide the newly received factories into three categories: for auction, for lease, and for joint operation, and will do its best to transfer them to private operation. They are currently being processed one after another.

C. Trade: On August 16 of the 35th year, the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters announced the "Provisional Measures for the Adjustment of Commodity Imports and Exports" and the "Provisional Measures for Railway Whole-Vehicle Freight Transportation," classifying exports into three categories: ordinary exports, licensed exports, and specially licensed exports, while imports were not restricted. Later, the export of metals and steel in the licensed export materials was stipulated to be barter trade, in order to adjust the supply of materials inside and outside the customs. In addition, in order to prevent merchants from obtaining excessive profits, when exporting commodities with excessive price differences inside and outside the customs, it was stipulated that a "profit-balancing fund" should be levied in addition to legal profits. The law was well-intentioned, but unfortunately, the power of the implementing agency could not be concentrated, the economic inspection could not exert efficiency, and the staff of the Railway Bureau committed fraud and smuggled goods, so the trend of smuggling was very rampant, so those who played with the law could take advantage of it, and those who followed the rules could not survive. The trade situation fell into a state of monopoly, which is regrettable. Regarding the quantity of import and export materials, according to the announcement of the Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee, the total value of goods leaving the customs from June to December of the 35th year was more than 12.8 billion yuan, and the total value of goods entering the customs was more than 10.6 billion yuan, with a surplus of 2.2 billion yuan. Most of the goods leaving the customs were manufactured products, which were close to consumables, and most of the goods entering the customs were food and raw materials. The main exports were cigarettes, cotton cloth, and gasoline, and their prices far exceeded several times the value of the same amount of goods entering the customs. From this observation, the current foreign trade in the Northeast is quite unreasonable. We believe that the Northeast must establish an overall economic construction plan, promote industrial production, and implement planned trade, so that the future can be optimistic.

When the reporter asked about his expectations for the future development of the Northeast, he replied with an extremely optimistic mood: The Northeast is not only the lifeline of the people of the Northeast, but also the nutrient storehouse of all Chinese people. For the past fourteen years, it has been occupied by the enemy, and although it has been arbitrarily exploited and looted, and the essence has been robbed, since the victory, the Soviet army first stationed illegal armed forces to sneak in, and important materials and equipment were moved and looted, which we feel very sad. However, with the rich natural resources here, which can still be developed, and the damaged factories and mines, which can still be restored, it is not difficult to restore the old appearance of the puppet Manchukuo era after ten years of recuperation. However, the prerequisite that must be resolved is that the Northeast must be fully taken over, and the Communist bandits' power must not be allowed to develop in this way for a long time. As long as the Communist bandits in the Northeast exist, all economic construction will be out of the question. We have not yet made a hasty judgment on whether there is external manipulation behind the Communist bandits in the Northeast, but if Lushun and Dalian cannot be quickly taken over, it is inevitable that external forces will gradually intervene. Judging from the current situation in the Northeast, we cannot avoid our new fear, and we have the right to demand that all peace-loving and righteous people in the world jointly eliminate this kind of latent new crisis. The Northeast has now been restored from the iron hooves of the Japanese imperialists, and we will not allow any foreign forces to exist again. Not only that, but we also hope that the peace conference with Japan can be convened as soon as possible, and that it will be held in Shenyang, and that all the economic losses suffered by the Northeast in the past fourteen years will be compensated by Japan in full. At the same time, after Japan surrendered, before our government took over, we also hope that the Allied Reparations Committee will consider the accidental losses suffered by the Northeast, whether in the financial or economic sectors, and discuss a reasonable and practical compensation plan. As for the future path of economic development in the Northeast, he believes that the first thing to do is to reorganize and restore the inherent industrial and mining enterprises, strive to increase production and self-sufficiency, reduce imports and increase exports, and that the currency system in the Northeast should be kept unified with the national currency system, and it should not be that the nine provinces circulation coupons exist for a long time. Finally, he said: We welcome General Wedemeyer to the Northeast with extremely warm emotions, and hope that Mr. Wei can use the factual data obtained from this trip to help solve the Northeast problem, and that spiritual assistance will be even more important than material assistance.

### Tragic Case of American Soldiers in Beijing Pushing People into the Water, the Culprit Was Interrogated Several Times Yesterday, the Ambassador Instructed Brooks to Punish According to the Law

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch on the 3rd] Regarding the tragic case of an American soldier pushing our Air Force soldier into the water outside Guanghua Gate and drowning him, Ambassador Stuart read about it in the newspaper on the morning of the 3rd and immediately summoned Major General Brooks, the head of the US Military Advisory Group, to inquire about the details, instructing him to investigate the facts and punish him severely according to the law. He also drove to visit Foreign Minister Wang to discuss the matter. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also paying close attention to this matter, and sent key personnel to the scene of the incident on the 3rd to investigate, and conducted detailed investigations into the circumstances of the incident and the identity of the offending American soldier from our military police witnesses, family members of the victims, and the US Military Advisory Group, so as to verify the case. The US Military Advisory Group is also dealing with this matter as soon as possible. Although the 3rd was a holiday, the criminals who were identified by our military police Cheng Chaozong and detained by the US side were still interrogated several times. However, for the sake of prudence, there was no report to the outside world. At 5:00 p.m., Brooks accompanied the captain of the military police to visit the ambassador again to report. The two deceased were both only sons, and their parents were extremely sad. They deeply hoped that the case would be resolved reasonably as soon as possible, that condolences would be given quickly, that the wicked would be severely punished, and that resentment would be pacified early.

US Military Advisory Group Announces That Adore Was the Sole Culprit

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 3rd] A spokesman for the US Military Advisory Group in China announced today: Regarding the drowning of two Chinese people near the Zhonghe Bridge late on the 1st, the investigation has now revealed that Staff Sergeant Adore is solely responsible.

Sergeant Sevani was not away from the car when the incident occurred and knew nothing about what happened, so his crime may be mitigated.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 3rd] Captain Bower, the military police commander of the US Military Advisory Group, said on the 3rd: The two US soldiers who pushed two Chinese people into the river on the evening of the 1st will be formally charged on the evening of the 3rd, and they will be tried for the first time in the middle of next week. Both Sevani and Adore belong to the military police, but they were not on duty on the evening of the 1st, so they cannot be treated as military police. Adore was arrested at 2:30 p.m. on the 2nd, but was granted two hours of parole to marry Corporal Russell of the Women's Auxiliary Corps. It is said that the highest penalty for the culprit in this case will be five to thousands of years in prison.

### Editorial: Higher Education Should Be Developed Universally

According to reports, there are currently as many as 69 colleges and universities across the country that have requested to change their systems or relocate. Why do they want to make requests for relocation? Are their requirements reasonable?

"The national higher education should be developed universally according to the region," which was decided by the Education Rehabilitation Conference convened by the Ministry of Education in November of the year before last. At that time, it was believed that education "rehabilitation" was not "restoration," and that national higher education institutions should be distributed in a planned manner, so as not to concentrate in big cities and develop in a deformed way. After this decision, many colleges, independent colleges, and universities were designated to be located in relatively remote locations to shoulder the arduous mission of developing inland culture.

This educational policy is theoretically correct. National higher education institutions should never be concentrated in several cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin. But what is the fact? What is the situation of inland universities after rehabilitation? Can they shoulder the solemn mission of making higher education universally developed nationwide? Why are they asking to relocate one after another? This is worthy of our attention.

The basic conditions for the success of the education undertaking are teachers and equipment. Inland higher education institutions lack these basic conditions for success, and the hardship is thousands of times more serious than that of schools in cities. University equipment is simple and lacks good teachers, so it cannot satisfy students' desire for knowledge. As a result, waves of disturbances arise, requiring relocation. School administrators cannot handle it and finally resign one after another. School administration loses its center of gravity, and the Ministry of Education also has difficulty coping with it.

Why are many university professors unwilling to teach in the interior? Summarizing the reasons, there are six points: First, the salary is too low, there are no positions to hold concurrently in the interior, and they cannot engage in other businesses to maintain their lives; second, the transportation is inconvenient, the travel expenses are high, and they are often prone to accidental disasters; third, the library and equipment are poor, and it is not easy to add them, and research tools are lacking; fourth, the medical equipment is incomplete, and life is not guaranteed; fifth, there are fewer good primary and secondary schools, and children's schooling is a problem; sixth, there is less contact between individuals and other people from all walks of life, and development is difficult. With these six reasons, the phenomenon of an oversupply of teachers in Beijing and Shanghai and a shortage of teachers in the interior has been created. University professors are free professions. For the sake of life safety, economic solutions, knowledge advancement, children's education, and basic material life requirements (such as electricity and tap water), you have no reason or ability to force them to go to the interior. Therefore, the professors hired by the Ministry of Education are also concentrated in cities. Check the requests for relocation from universities or colleges in the interior, and none of them fail to mention the inconvenience of transportation and the difficulty of hiring professors as reasons. If a university lacks good professors and equipment, it is equivalent to losing its soul. In this case, how can we talk about improving students' level? How can we talk about cultivating a spirit of research? How can we talk about developing inland culture? How can we talk about academics? Coupled with the unstable factors of politics and economy, the situation of higher education in the interior is declining.

The education undertaking must seek progress in stability. Excellent teachers, perfect equipment, satisfying students' desire for knowledge, and guiding them to the path of academic research to explore the truth are urgent tasks today. Forsaking this and seeking school stability and academic development are all abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial, and laboring without success.

Our country's higher education must not only seek development in big cities, but must go deep into the interior. We are willing to support the proposition of seeking the average development of national higher education in various places, but this is not something that can be done by empty words. It must be accompanied by practical measures. The primary plan is how to enable inland universities to hire excellent professors and enrich their equipment. These are all responsibilities that the education administrative authorities cannot shirk. The construction costs, equipment costs, administrative costs, etc. of universities, independent colleges, and colleges in the interior (including teachers' travel expenses) should all be subject to special preferential single-line laws, aiming at the six reasons mentioned above why university professors are unwilling to serve in the interior, so as to gradually solve them. Universities in big cities should be enriched and developed, and universities in the interior should be enriched and developed. The viewpoint of educational administration should make the latter more important than the former, and change the past style of universities in big cities getting the first opportunity to obtain funding. Only in this way can universities in the rear absorb talents and enrich equipment; only in this way can national higher education be developed universally. Otherwise, the calls for relocation from various inland schools today will not be expected to stop, and this problem may not be reasonably resolved.

### Reforming Local Politics

Following the National Food Conference, the Executive Yuan took advantage of the presence of provincial governors in the capital to hold four administrative symposiums. These gatherings brought together the provincial governors and heads of various central government ministries to allow the provincial governors to explain the practical difficulties of local administration and their demands from the central government. The central government, on the other hand, reviewed and instructed on the opinions presented by the provincial governors, and put forward its hopes for the local governments. The aim was to foster mutual understanding between the central and local levels, thereby jointly striving to implement current national policies. The administrative symposium concluded successfully yesterday. According to reports from this newspaper's correspondent in the capital, the main issues discussed at the symposium were as follows: (1) How can provincial politics be coordinated with constitutionalism during the period of constitutional preparation? (2) After the promulgation of the general mobilization order, how can the mobilization of local manpower, financial resources, and materials be coordinated with military affairs? (3) How to ensure local public security and order? (4) How to rationally adjust local administrative and financial institutions?

The above-mentioned issues are indeed very serious at present. If these issues cannot be reasonably resolved, then all plans for reforming politics will be out of the question. However, this administrative symposium only exchanged opinions between the central and local governments and did not make concrete decisions. Therefore, we must still appeal to the central government to pay close attention to the reform of local administration. According to a telegram from this newspaper's Nanjing office on the 2nd, supervisory committee members Yu Shude and 42 others jointly proposed a "Sixteen Points for Urgent Implementation of Political Reform" proposal. It is reported that the content is divided into two major parts: politics and economics. It also puts forward some opinions on reforming local politics, the most noteworthy of which are: (1) Implementing civilian rule over the military and civilians, and local officials must not be held by military personnel; (2) Local officials must not hold concurrent positions, and a one-person-one-job system must be strictly implemented; (3) Dividing the powers of the central and local governments, and abolishing special local systems; (4) Reducing and merging redundant institutions, improving and standardizing the treatment of public and teaching staff. We hope that the government authorities should not only pay special attention to this proposal for political reform, but also do everything possible to ensure that it is effectively implemented in the shortest possible time.

The separation of military and civilian affairs should no longer be an issue in China in theory. However, in the early days of the Japanese surrender, the administration of various provinces was primarily focused on surrender acceptance, reception, and demobilization. Therefore, the governors of various provinces had to be held by military personnel. Later, the communist bandits rebelled, putting some provinces under military control. In order to ensure the security of the area, it was still appropriate for military personnel to serve as local leaders. Therefore, up to now, most of the governors of various provinces are held by military personnel. However, this transitional approach should not be allowed to exist for a long time. Provinces that are no longer threatened by the communist bandits should first implement the separation of military and civilian affairs, so that local politics can get on the right track as soon as possible.

If we observe "the affairs of the people"—politics—with the simplest perspective, it is not difficult to reach a conclusion: that which is most closely related to people's daily lives is local politics. The quality of local politics is enough to directly affect the people's attitude towards the government. If the government authorities want to talk about reforming politics today, they must start with reforming local politics. Otherwise, any good plans and methods will inevitably be empty talk and cannot be realized.

At present, the provinces are preparing for a general election. This is the first general election in our country after the National Assembly passed the new constitution, and it is also the first step for our country's politics to move towards democratization. Whether the first step is taken well will affect the future of our country's democratic constitutionalism. Therefore, before the general election is held, we advocate that a reform movement should be launched in the politics of various provinces first, so as to ensure that the general election in various provinces can proceed smoothly within the normal track of constitutionalism!

### Van Mook Orders Dutch Troops to Cease Fire from Midnight Tonight; Indonesia Agrees to Take Similar Steps

[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 3rd - Radio broadcast: Dutch-Indonesian Governor-General Van Mook today ordered Dutch troops to cease fire from midnight tomorrow. Van Mook claimed in a broadcast: "Although the Netherlands believes that the Dutch-Indonesian dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the United Nations, it has still ordered a ceasefire. It is deeply believed that both sides can cease fire, stop all violence, and stop propaganda warfare." Van Mook also stated that the Dutch side will retain the positions occupied by Dutch troops.

[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 3rd - Radio Yogyakarta, Indonesia, claims that the Indonesian government has agreed to take similar steps with the Dutch side and issue a ceasefire order.

[Reuters, The Hague, 3rd] The Dutch News Agency in Batavia reports that the working committee of the Indonesian Republic's parliament has been urgently summoned to Yogyakarta on Friday. The Hague believes that the purpose is to discuss the US mediation proposal for the Indonesian dispute.

[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] Radio Yogyakarta broadcast a declaration from the Indonesian Republic government, stating that it fully agrees with the UN Security Council's proposal for a ceasefire between Indonesia and the Netherlands. However, the Republic government requires that both sides withdraw their troops to the demarcation line determined in October 1946 as a condition. In addition, in order to ensure that no acts of aggression that threaten or disrupt peace occur again, the Security Council should order the Dutch troops to withdraw from the land of the Indonesian archipelago. The Republic earnestly hopes that the Security Council will send a delegation to Indonesia to investigate the actual situation and resolve the dispute quickly. The Republic's statement also accuses the Dutch government of violating the Linggadjati Agreement, and further states that the Republic has accepted the consequences of the Dutch side's unilateral breach of contract. The Republic is now free from the constraints of future membership in the Indonesian Federation and has obtained complete freedom of action to formally become a sovereign state in the international community. The Indonesian Republic is prepared to send representatives to Lake Success at the invitation to provide the Security Council with the necessary information. The Republic is particularly grateful for the actions of India and Australia.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 3rd] Dutch troops announced a battle report today stating that the Dutch Navy has concentrated its landing at Cilacap, the last major Indonesian port on the south coast of Java, and occupied it without resistance. At the same time, the Dutch Army swept down from Semarang and also attacked Cilacap.

### Burmese Cabinet Reorganized

More Arrests Continue in Assassination Case

[Reuters, Rangoon, 2nd] The Burmese government has undergone a major reorganization. Except for Prime Minister Thakin Nu, almost all ministries have been changed.

### Bidault Declares That Policy on the Ruhr Remains Unchanged

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that Foreign Minister Bidault said yesterday that "France will do its best to develop the Ruhr under European control for the use of Europe, including Germany," which does not indicate that France's policy on the Ruhr will change. Bidault's remarks are not only insufficient to indicate a softening of France's attitude on the Ruhr issue, but also a reaffirmation of France's policy on the Ruhr. The French government has never insisted that Germany should not benefit from the Ruhr with other parts of Europe. What France values is that Germany cannot control the production of the Ruhr. This is why Bidault declared "under European control."

[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] French Foreign Minister Bidault stated during a debate on the Foreign Ministry's budget in the French Parliament that France must strive to develop the Ruhr to serve the entire Europe rather than Germany alone, otherwise Germany will once again become a great harm to Europe.

### Serious British Economic Crisis; Government Will Likely Take Emergency Measures; Douglas Will Meet Clayton to Submit Report

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Authoritative sources believe that the British economic crisis has reached its most critical stage and cannot wait for assistance under the Marshall Plan to be obtained. Therefore, it is expected that the statement to be made by the British government in the House of Commons on Wednesday will be the most critical and serious indication since the declaration of war in 1939. US Ambassador Douglas is scheduled to fly from London to Paris today to meet with US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton to discuss the British government's view that the United States has not fully understood the urgency of the British economic crisis. He will inform him that the crisis of British dollar reserves will turn into a crisis of the British pound within weeks, threatening the stability of the British currency system.

According to recent authoritative estimates, the loans Britain has borrowed from the United States will be exhausted by the end of September. Even with measures such as reducing imports, they will inevitably be exhausted by mid-October at the latest. It is generally recognized that assistance under the Marshall Plan, even if it becomes a reality next spring, is already too late for Britain. Although the British government has not formally requested the United States to provide transitional assistance before the Marshall Plan is implemented, it is known that when Clayton was first in London, the British government explained the urgency of Britain's economic needs to him. However, a month has passed since then, and the United States has not yet made any indication, while Britain has only $1 billion remaining in loans from the United States. Under unavoidable circumstances, it will inform the United States that it will not be able to sign a multilateral trade agreement with discriminatory import provisions.

Predicted Contents of Emergency Measures

[Reuters, London, 3rd] A reporter for the "Sunday Express" expects that the economic crisis rescue plan to be announced by Prime Minister Attlee in the House of Commons on Wednesday will include measures such as restricting imports to those necessary for life and export industries, levying a 2.5 percent capital tax, generally controlling prices, and extending working hours. He listed the emergency measures to be proposed by the Prime Minister, which will include the following: (1) Levying a capital tax, or adopting a compulsory savings method, forcing a deduction of 2.5 percent of wages, which will be returned with interest in the future; (2) Restricting imports to those necessary for daily life and export industries; (3) Expanding price controls; (4) Increasing working hours, or ordering workers to engage in one extra day of work per week; (5) Concentrating raw materials for export industries, and industries unrelated to exports or non-essential industries will be forced to close, making their workers participate in export industries; (6) Reducing military personnel, and British troops stationed in Greece, Italy, and most of the British troops stationed in Germany may be withdrawn; (7) Restricting spending on overseas vacations; (8) Investigating those engaged in the black market and those who evade work. In addition, reducing the value of clothing ration coupons, stopping the rationing of gasoline for non-essential uses, and implementing a ration coupon system in restaurants are all possible measures to be taken.

### US to Test Atomic Bomb; Power Against the Panama Canal

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] It is reported that the United States is conducting a secret test to find out the impact of an atomic bomb attack on the Panama Canal. This news was revealed in the report of the House Committee that inspected the Panama Canal this spring in March and has been confirmed by a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Commission. It is reported that the committee recommended spending $2.1 billion to improve the canal to ensure that it would not be damaged if directly hit by a large bomb, but it cannot withstand an atomic bomb. The report pointed out that the waterway of the Panama Canal is 85 feet above the waterline, so the atomic bomb will be able to drain the highlands lake, causing the canal to be unusable for two or three years. The cost of the canal's live gates is valued at $2.8 billion. The report did not reveal the details of the canal atomic test, but it is widely believed that the test will use TNT explosives to destroy the model of the sluice gate. The amount of TNT explosives is the same as the size of the sluice gate and the ratio of the atomic bomb to the Panama Canal.

### US Representative to the UN Accuses Soviets of Deliberate Delay

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] US Representative to the UN Military Staff Committee General McNarney recently gave a radio speech, accusing the Soviet Union of delaying the establishment of UN military forces. He said: "There has been no result from the discussion of 41 agenda items for a year. Of these, 25 have been agreed upon by our people, and 16 have not been agreed upon. The Soviet Union's opinions on these 16 items are not the same as those of the other 11 countries."

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] Soviet representative to the Atomic Energy Commission Osipian attacked the Soviet representatives, saying: "They are obstructing all negotiations on world atomic energy control. Their actions seem to be unaware of the new and terrible nature of atomic weapons." The US representative also said: Atomic negotiations are almost completely deadlocked between the Soviet Union and other countries.

### President of Uruguay Dies

### Electricity Generation and Distribution Companies Nationalized; British Parliament Passes Bill; Scheduled to be Implemented on New Year's Day Next Year

[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] The British Labor government has completed another major action in its nationalization plan, namely taking over electricity generation and distribution companies. The bill passed by Parliament stipulates the takeover of 190 private companies, estimated to cost $1.4 billion, and is scheduled to be implemented on New Year's Day next year. In addition to electricity, the Labor government has now nationalized coal mines, the Bank of England, inland transportation, civil aviation, and overseas communications. The steel and gas industries will also have to be nationalized within the next three years in order to achieve its goal of 20 percent of national enterprises being nationalized and 80 percent being privately owned. If there are other plans in the future, they will also be included in the Socialist Party's platform for the next election.

### US Actively Researching Construction of Underground Aircraft Factories

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of the Army Royal recently revealed in his report on his activities during his tenure as Secretary of the Army that Army engineers plan to build an underground aircraft factory to test whether the factory is safe under the attack of atomic bombs or other new types of bombs. The Army Air Corps is also studying plans related to manufacturing precision aircraft parts in underground factories. Based on the results of this research, the Army plans to obtain funding in fiscal year 1948 and order the Chief of Engineers to build an underground aircraft factory for the above-mentioned project. He said: The underground defense plan also includes the establishment of a chemical plant and a fireproof instrument factory.

### Close Political and Economic Cooperation; Southern Bulgaria Signs Agreement; Another Concrete Step Against the Marshall Plan

[Associated Press, Belgrade, 2nd] The Yugoslav government announced on the 2nd that Southern Bulgaria has established several extensive agreements, including a customs union, abolition of passports, diplomatic cooperation, and a unified action against Greece, with seven main points. Political circles in London believe that this is another concrete step by countries under Soviet control against the Marshall Plan.

[Reuters, Belgrade, 2nd] The governments of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria issued a joint communique tonight, announcing that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simić and Bulgarian Foreign Minister Georgiev have signed important agreements in Bled, Slovenia, which stipulate the signing of a mutual assistance treaty and full economic, political, and cultural cooperation. In addition, it is stipulated that passports for entry and exit will be abolished, and the joint ownership of property in border areas is planned, so the borders of the two countries are practically equivalent to being abolished.

South Forgoes Bulgarian Reparations

The entire agreement is divided into eight parts: (1) Drafting a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance. (2) Full economic cooperation, including the formulation of exchange rates, the preparation of a customs union, and the mutual coordination of economic plans. (The communique also said that the governments of the two countries have established various concrete resolutions on mutual assistance in industry, electrification, mining, agriculture, transportation, and foreign trade.) (3) The two countries signed a new border agreement to replace the 1939 border convention, which includes the abolition of passports for entry and exit, and the establishment of a joint ownership system for property in border areas. (4) Developing railways and other transportation between Southern Bulgaria and Bulgaria. (5) The governments of the two countries maintain close contact on the recent repeated provocations launched by the Greek government on the border, the biased activities of the Security Council's investigation team, and other important international issues, especially the Danube River issue. (6) Full cultural cooperation, including the exchange of newspapers. (7) The South gives up its right to demand compensation of 25 million yuan in goods from Bulgaria. (8) Conclusion: Lists the main points of the agreement. The Bulgarian representatives departed for home tonight.

### Reasons for the Decline in US Export Trade in June

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The government released statistics: the total value of US export trade in June was 1.24 billion US dollars, a decrease of 13% compared to May, i.e., 180 million US dollars. This is the first major setback in US foreign trade, and some foreign trade experts unofficially regard it as a turning point in the decline of US foreign trade. Analyses of the reasons for the export decline include: (1) rapid depletion of foreign gold and US dollar assets; (2) foreign countries reducing purchases to maintain their declining purchasing power. Possible impacts of the export decline are as follows: (1) Commerce and employment will be disrupted, but the cessation of foreign competition in purchasing American goods may partially remedy US inflation. (2) As US imports decrease, foreign inflation will worsen, and the economic crisis will intensify political turmoil.

### Italian President Signs Instrument of Ratification of Peace Treaty; Exchange of Diplomatic Letters between US and Italy Announced

Italian Foreign Minister Sforza replied that the Italian people are very willing to satisfy the hopes of the United States through the United Nations or treaties between the two countries.

### The Declining Trend of Communist Parties in Various Countries

Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Office

(I)

Communist parties in various countries around the world are gradually losing power. Some countries are rejecting communist parties in order to acquire US dollars. Some countries are trying to restore their unity and revive themselves by removing communist parties.

However, this trend may be temporary. Most governments hoping to obtain US dollars have not yet succeeded. Communist parties may make a comeback. In several countries, communist parties have considerable power, and governments cannot stand firm without their support.

The US State Department is currently conducting an investigation to determine the impact of US policy on the struggle between communist and non-communist parties around the world. The results of the investigation are as follows:

Since President Truman announced the loan plan for Greece and Turkey on March 12th, to strengthen their ability to resist communism and Soviet pressure, the decline of communist party power in various countries has become even more pronounced.

The Soviet Union is extremely concerned about the decline of communist party power in various countries. Moscow often accuses the United States of supporting reactionaries and "encouraging fascism." However, liberals in most countries have benefited from this US action, while communist parties have suffered.

France

The French Communist Party has now left the government because, although they verbally supported the cabinet's wage freeze policy, they actually attempted to support strikers in demanding wages, and were therefore removed from the cabinet.

The French Communist Party is also gradually losing power in trade unions. This spring, they hoped to gain control of the social security system through the election of national workers, but the vote count resulted in failure due to insufficient votes. Now, the Socialist Party and other non-communist parties are challenging the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor, France's largest labor organization.

One of the most vocal opponents of the French Communist Party is General de Gaulle, the wartime leader of Free France. Encouraged by the US Mediterranean policy, de Gaulle established an anti-communist movement organization with a claimed membership of one million. His efforts accelerated the Communist Party's separation.

The non-communist government of France is currently seeking aid from the United States. France needs to import 2 billion tons of wheat before August 1948 and needs 1 billion US dollars for construction. French Communist Party leader Duclos is now relying on the party's influence in French labor to prevent France's views on seeking US dollars from diverging too far from the Communist Party.

To please the French people, the French Communist Party is trying to stop strikes and increase production. However, strikes still occur from time to time. If the Communist Party does not stop but incites strikes, the French economy may collapse.

Northern Europe

In Northern Europe, the Soviet Union's northern neighbors are now excluding communist parties. A free election of Finnish workers has seized control of the National Trade Union Committee from the hands of the Communist Party. As a result, relations between Finland and the Soviet Union have become strained. Since February 1946, the total amount of US loans and credit loans obtained by Finland has exceeded 100 million US dollars. In addition, they need more US dollars to fund the 1948 import plan. However, Finland still does not dare to openly oppose the Soviet Union.

During the Danish general election in April of this year, the Communist Party received only 71,900 votes, which is incomparable to the 255,536 votes received in the 1945 national election. Denmark is now moving towards restoration and plans to borrow 50 million US dollars from the World Bank, but has not directly requested a loan from the United States.

Germany

In recent elections in West Germany, the number of votes for the Communist Party suddenly plummeted. Only in North Rhine-Westphalia, a district in the British occupation zone, did the Communist Party receive 14% of the votes. In other districts, it only received 5% to 8% of the total votes.

Holy Land

The Arab Communist Party in Palestine has doubled its membership in a year, but recently, due to the Soviet Union's approval of the Palestine partition plan opposed by the Arabs, it has gradually lost its prestige. Most of the 20,000 workers in the Communist Party's trade union have gradually left the union. The Jewish Communist Party occupies only 3 seats out of 171 seats in the Jewish Parliament, and its power is still very weak.

Americas

Anti-communist sentiment in the Americas is expanding. Chilean President Videla, who was elected in 1946 with the support of the Communist Party, has excluded three communist ministers from his cabinet in order to obtain US economic assistance.

The Brazilian Communist Party received 500,000 votes in the last election and was recently ordered by the Electoral Court to be placed outside the protection of the law, accusing it of intentionally overthrowing the democratic government. The Brazilian economy is closely related to the United States, and the United States' recent policies towards the Soviet Union and the Communist Party have influenced Brazil's political trends.

Japan

In Japan, the national general election held in April of this year almost halved the number of votes for the Communist Party compared to 1946. The Communist Party occupies only four seats out of 466 seats in the Lower House of Parliament, and none in the Upper House.

(II)

On the other hand, there are relatively few countries where the Communist Party is gaining power.

Italy

The Communist Party in Italy is quite powerful, setting up its own hospitals, schools, and secret police. In a state of widespread unemployment and famine, the Communist Party appeals to people as a "government for the poor," attracting many believers.

The United States has shipped more than 1 billion US dollars worth of relief supplies to Italy, and the Export-Import Bank is now considering Italy's 100 million US dollar loan request. However, the impact of the US dollars already given or promised to Italy on Italy's future is still very minimal. As a result, the Communist Party has increased its vote count in elections and controls most of the industrial areas.

Eastern Europe

In Berlin, within the Soviet occupation zone, the Communist Party has already controlled 500,000 workers through trade union elections. In Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, under Communist Party control, face little opposition. Non-communist parties in Hungary are gradually weakening under pressure from the Communist Party police. Poland, although subject to Communist Party control, is currently seeking a loan in US dollars from the United States.

For the above reasons, the stalemate between communist and non-communist parties is deepening. The new equilibrium between the two may be the result of the current trend. The advantage currently gained by non-communist parties may not last forever, but there is little hope for the Communist Party to restore the number of election votes and prestige lost since the United States established a new policy in the Mediterranean.

### German Factory in US Occupation Zone Secretly Stores War Equipment and Sells It to the Soviet Occupation Authorities; Soviet Side Issued Letter Proving the Need for Such Instruments

[Reuters, Hamburg, 2nd] Personnel at the Askania factory in Berlin (the place where US military authorities discovered a large number of illegal war equipment yesterday) said: the equipment manufactured by the factory was equipped and transported to the factory branch in Teltow in the Soviet zone, and then resold to the Soviet occupation forces. According to the German news agency in the British zone, the executive and production council of Askania stated that after forty observation and surveying instruments were transported to the Teltow branch and resold to the Soviet occupation authorities, Soviet representatives issued a letter proving the need for these instruments. These instruments are suitable for various surveying and observation tasks and can be used for both military and civilian purposes. The manufacture of these instruments takes several months and are not newly made, but are assembled from existing parts. Not many have been sold since the end of the war. The Askania factory authorities also stated that the submarine periscopes found at the factory branch in the Mirindorf district of Berlin were found in a scrap metal pile. The US military helped to collect part of this scrap metal, and the support rods of the periscopes have been cut off for the manufacture of other items. Askania factory no longer has the machinery to manufacture new periscopes. According to the German news agency in the US zone, the instruments supplied by the Askania factory to the Soviet authorities are for measuring railways, and the Americans had already helped to conduct partial inspections. As for whether these instruments are used for other purposes, the factory cannot be held responsible. It is also learned that the production committee will announce on Monday a statement regarding the arrest of six executive heads of the factory and the US authorities' investigation of the matter.

### Kidnapping Case in Puxi Demands Ransom of Hundreds of Millions; Rescue of Three Hostages by Directly Assaulting the Bandit Den; Confessions of Captured Criminals Reveal Complex Details; Bandit Leader Prepared to Expand the New Fourth Army after Receiving the Money

[Report from This Newspaper] On the night of the 21st of last month, a bizarre kidnapping case occurred in Tiqiao Township, Puxi. A total of four people, men and women, were kidnapped. After the incident, the bandits secretly negotiated with the families of the kidnapped. Finally, an "agreement" was reached with 360 shi of white rice as the price for the ransom of the hostages. At the same time, for the convenience of the families of the victims, the bandits agreed to convert it at 350,000 yuan per shi, totaling 126 million legal tender. It was agreed that the money and the people would be exchanged at a general merchandise store next to the Huangjialu railway station outside the East Gate of Nanhui County on the afternoon of the 30th. As a result, the case was detected and solved by the Fifth Inspection Brigade of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The sixth bao chief of Tiqiao Township, Wu Caifu, Zhou, the wife of Xu Jintao, a resident, and Zhu Cailin and his wife Chen, merchants, were kidnapped at the same time on the night of the 21st. Although the families of the victims remained tight-lipped at the time, the Fifth Inspection Brigade of the Songhu Garrison Command had already heard the news and was conducting an investigation. Suddenly, it was heard that Zhu Cailin's wife had been released midway, and the bandits sent someone with a handwritten letter from Zhu Cailin to secretly negotiate the ransom. The brigade stepped up its investigation and learned that Zhu Cailin, who was kidnapped, was the township chief of the township during the enemy-puppet period, and that Xu Zhou was Xu Jintao's abandoned wife. It was believed that the case seemed to have other complex details, so they conducted an in-depth investigation based on the original clues and tried to approach the relatives of the kidnapped and monitor their movements. However, the families of the kidnapped were intimidated by the power of the bandits and feared being torn apart, so they did not dare to reveal any information, and only secretly carried out the ransom work. Therefore, the investigation work was quite difficult to start. Li Renzhang, the brigade commander, decided to take a side investigation and obtained definite clues from Zhu Cailin's brother, who was also his cousin, and proved that Zhu's wife had escaped and returned on July 23. The servant sent a letter and agreed on the location to contact the bandits, all of which were facts. Zhu's brother also said that the bandit leader was Xu Jintao, the husband of the victim Xu Zhou. Zhu's brother also said: He sent someone to the appointment as scheduled. The bandits initially bargained and demanded 700 shi of white rice as ransom. Because the number was too large and he was unable to afford it, he did not agree immediately. Led by Xu Jintao and others, he walked about half a mile and then took a small boat to a small village and met his brother Zhu Cailin (hostage) and personally negotiated the ransom of 320 shi of white rice. However, the bandits demanded an additional dozen quick-slow machine guns, saying that their "brigade" was newly established and did not have enough guns. He refused to buy them, and later decided to add 40 shi of rice, totaling 360 shi, and priced it at 35, totaling 126 million yuan for ransom. It was agreed that the money would be delivered at a general merchandise store next to the Huangjialu railway station outside the East Gate of Nanhui County on the afternoon of the 30th. At this point, the investigation work had reached a considerable maturity. Brigade Commander Li then reported the whole process to Director Tao Yishan, and Director Tao ordered him to ask Deputy Director Zhang, and planned to solve the case. After careful study, it was decided that the Fifth Brigade would join forces with the Eighth Brigade (Pudong) to destroy it when the money was delivered. On July 30, Action Section Chief Cai Xingke led cadres Tao Zujie and Gu Yufeng, together with the Eighth Inspection Brigade, disguised themselves and secretly investigated the address. Cai and others arrived at the destination before dawn. Cai first scouted the terrain, but waited all day without any movement. Cai and others originally planned to immediately surround and conduct a powerful search, but the environment there was complicated and there was no reliable internal line. If the search was unsuccessful, it would only startle the snakes and all the efforts would be in vain. So he lurked nearby and sent out scouts to inquire in many ways until the morning of the 31st before returning to the team. On the 1st of this month, summarizing the information obtained from all parties, it was learned that the payment was made on the 30th. Because the victim's family was afraid of being torn apart, it was sent secretly and did not reveal any trace to the team, so a good opportunity was lost. It was also learned that the money was paid in installments. There was a second batch scheduled to be collected by the bandits at No. 63 Lane, Jin Shenfu Road in this city at 3-4 pm on the 1st. He sent Section Chief Cai to lead Tao Zujie, Gu Yufeng, and volunteers Tang Hechang, Wu Tiemin, Chai Youqin, Wang Deshi, etc. to secretly investigate. At five o'clock, two suspicious people were seen echoing each other in the lane. Observing their behavior, it was determined that they were bandits. They launched a secret signal and started at the same time. Xu Jintao, the main criminal of the bizarre kidnapping case, and his accomplice Xu Achu, were all arrested. After interrogation, it was learned that the location of the hostages was the Zhongjia Ancestral Hall in Tongqiao, about six miles east of Dongjialu in Nanhui County. At 9 pm that night, Brigade Commander Li Renzhang personally led Cai Xingke and other large numbers of cadres, escorted the bandit Xu Achu, and went there again to join forces with the Eighth Brigade to arrest the remaining bandits and rescue the hostages. Then the Eighth Brigade dispatched three members including Wu Baohe, set off from Dongchang Road to Zhoupu at 12:00 midnight, and joined forces with the local self-defense team to take action. When they arrived near Tongqiao, it was already 2:30 before dawn on the 2nd. They passed Yemaodong (village name), and the road was narrow and only able to accommodate feet. Li and others groped forward under the moonlight. After walking another hundred steps, they suddenly saw a vast ocean blocking their way. They found a ferry and abandoned the land to board the boat and rushed straight to the Zhongjia Ancestral Hall to implement the encirclement. It turned out that all the bandits had moved elsewhere. They asked the old man guarding the ancestral hall, who replied that he was still there yesterday (meaning the 31st), but did not know where he went today. Under this circumstance, it was hopeless. He questioned Xu Achu again, and Xu knew that he could no longer hide it, and said that he might be hiding nearby. Brigade Commander Li supervised his subordinates to search around and set up sentry posts at key points and reached a glance in front of a house in Majiazhai, two people seemed to be guarding, trying to escape like rats. Brigade Commander Li hurriedly ordered his troops to move forward bravely. Guan Zujie took the lead and kicked down the bandit on guard. The quick-slow machine gun and hand grenade he was carrying had not been fired. Then the whole team arrived and captured the bandit Wu Longcai and Li Damei, the concubine of the bandit Ma Fulou, and Gu Wanyun, the concubine of the main criminal Xu Jintao. They seized one Mauser pistol, six bullets, one hand grenade, and millions of dollars in stolen money. They rescued Zhu Cailin and Xu Zhou, two hostages. There was also one hostage, Wu Caifu, and the bandit Ma Fulou, who escaped.

At this point, the interrogation began. Deputy Director Zhang Yangming of the Inspection Department, together with Brigade Commander Li Renzhang, Brigade Deputy Jiang Zongwei, etc., interrogated all night. The main criminal Xu Jinman confessed that he was 47 years old, from Nanhui, and married into the Zhou family. He lived with his wife in Tiqiao Township and had operated businesses such as cotton, rice, and aquatic products. He now runs a meat shop. In the 31st year, he met the nurse Gu Wanyun due to illness and took her as a concubine, secretly building a love nest at No. 68 Zhuxia Road, South City. Li Damei, the concubine of the bandit Ma Fulou, also lived in his home. Because he was robbed three times when he was a son-in-law in the Zhou family, he said that it was all related to Zhu Cailin, so he kidnapped Zhu this time for revenge. Also, because he had 20 mu of land in the Zhou family, after abandoning his original wife Zhou, Wu Caifu, the bao chief, prevented him from collecting rent by himself, so he held a grudge and kidnapped Wu, and planned to forcibly sell the 20 mu of land to Zhu and Wu. Therefore, he kidnapped his original wife to the scene to conduct the transaction. He also confessed to the planned kidnapping. He discussed it with the bandit Ma several times in early July. Ma gathered bandits to prepare guns. On July 23, it was decided to kidnap Zhu, Zhou, and Wu at the same time, and Xu himself scouted whether Zhu and others were at home. The next day (21), after Xu had scouted properly, he informed the bandit Ma, who led his followers Shen Jintao, Wang Asan, Wu Longcai (also known as A-er, from Jiangbei) Fan Jinsheng, Wang Maosheng, etc., to depart from Nanhui, take a bus to Tianfuan Station, where Xu Jintao arrived at the station at 5 pm, and discussed in a nearby teahouse. They set off at about 9 pm. They first went to Zhu Cailin's house. Xu Jintao humbly opened the door, and seven people poured in, took out pistols, and kidnapped Zhu and his wife. They kidnapped Zhou and Wu Caifu according to law. Halfway, Zhu's wife requested and was released. Then they changed the clothes they had prepared for the hostages to avoid being chased. In the Hanoi area, about eight miles from Zhoupu, they prepared two sailing boats at a price of 70,000 yuan each, guarded by the bandit concubines Gu Wanyun and Li Damei. When the hostages arrived at the river, they immediately boarded the boat and went straight to Nanhui and landed at the Xiama Ferry on Huangjialu, which was already about 8 am on the 22nd. Then they changed addresses every day and allowed the hostages freedom. Sometimes they even played cards with the bandits while conducting ransom negotiations. First, they asked for 700 shi of rice, then reduced it to 360 shi, which was worth 126 million yuan. They also agreed to give Xu Zhou 6 million yuan, so the bandits would net 120 million yuan. 30 million yuan was sent on July 30, and a 2 million yuan check was returned, and 20,000 yuan was missing. In fact, they had received 27.8 million yuan in cash. After the bandit Ma took 16 million yuan and spent more than 5 million yuan, the remaining money was all seized. It was also confessed that the bandit Ma was related to Zhang Dapeng of the New Fourth Army and claimed to be a brigade commander, preparing to expand the "team" after receiving the ransom. It was also confessed that in the case, because Deputy Director Zhang had made it clear that the bandits were from the New Fourth Army, they should not have committed this crime. Therefore, after clarifying the case, they pursued the rest, repeatedly inducing and threatening them, and finally confessed that when they were at the Zhongjia Ancestral Hall, they strangled a person to death in the dark, who was watching the Zhongjia Ancestral Hall. His surname was Ni, and Ni had two nephews, one named Ni Jilou and one named Ni A-er. Both were ruffians, and the brothers were enemies because of a dispute over housing. Ni A-er had said that he would kill his brother. Ni Jilou lived in Shanghai and worked as a tailor. He had been colleagues with the bandits Ma Fulou and Shen Jintao in the puppet army. And Ni Ma Shen and others were all tailors. At that time, Ni Jilou happened to return to Nanhui and accidentally met Ma Shen and others, and stored the hostages in his home (i.e., Zhong Temple). Ni A-er happened to see it, and Ma and others were afraid that he would leak the news, and Ni took the opportunity to seek revenge. Therefore, Shen Jintao, Wang Asan, and Huang Maosheng, etc., induced Ni A-er and strangled him to death with a rope, and threw his body into the nearby lake. The bandit Wu Longcai confessed that he was 22 years old, from Shanghai, and lived in Wu's house in Dongpu, Minhang. The details of the crime he confessed were the same as the confession of the bandit Xu. The two bandit concubines also directly admitted the previous situation. The Garrison Command is now investigating and arresting the escaped bandits.

### New Typhoon Rising in the South Pacific

After the typhoon that occurred in the Pacific Ocean passed Taiwan, it turned into a low-pressure system, and this city was fortunate to escape the attack, but due to the dissipation of the typhoon, the heat did not subside. Yesterday, according to the Meteorological Observatory, a weather warning signal was issued that a new typhoon was rising in the South Pacific. The new typhoon reached a position of 19 degrees north latitude and 132 degrees east longitude at 2 pm yesterday and is moving west-northwest. If the typhoon's direction does not change midway, Shanghai may still be attacked in a few days. According to the Meteorological Observatory's records, the highest temperature yesterday was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest was 79.1 degrees. The weather forecast for today is still sunny and hot.

### The Case of Yu Shengxiao's Murder: Investigation Gradually Becomes Clear; Multiple People Identify Cooley as the Arrested Englishman

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the case of the Westerner shooting Yu Shengxiao, significant progress was made yesterday. Since the Englishman Cooley was arrested and detained as a suspect, yesterday, the deceased's wife went to identify him and confirmed that the Cooley was the Cooley she was familiar with.

However, Cooley has consistently denied any involvement in the shooting, despite round-the-clock questioning by the police. It is now understood that the entire case is being investigated from two perspectives. On the one hand, Cooley himself is being interrogated, and on the other hand, relevant witnesses are being summoned for questioning.

According to a villager from Wu Jia Xiang, he was the first to discover Yu Shengxiao lying in a pool of blood by the roadside. Simultaneously, another villager testified that he did indeed witness a black sedan speeding on the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway near the scene of the incident. The driver was described as a robust Westerner with a small mustache, wearing a white shirt. Another Westerner was in the passenger seat, seemingly leaning over and wiping something on the seat. At the time, unaware that an incident had occurred, he did not pay attention to the car's license plate number.

Yesterday, the police also investigated everything with Yu Shengxiao's colleagues. According to them, they also confirmed that the arrested Cooley was the Cooley they were familiar with. Furthermore, they pointed out that before 3 PM that afternoon, Cooley had tea with Yu Shengxiao at the Wai Tan (Bund) Hui Zhong Hotel on Nanjing Road, discussing a transaction. Around 3 PM, when Yu Shengxiao was walking towards the Fei Da Tailor Shop on Sichuan Road, Ningbo Road, he mentioned the matter to someone in the shop, saying that Cooley would be driving there soon. However, around 4 PM, a heavy rain suddenly occurred. When the people in the shop remembered Yu Shengxiao, they searched for him but he was gone. At the time, they speculated that perhaps during the heavy rain, Cooley had driven nearby and picked up Yu Shengxiao.

### Arrested for Extortion While Wearing a Military Uniform

[Report from our newspaper] A young man named Zhang Zhixiang, who claimed to be a staff member of the Garrison Headquarters, extorted 50 million legal tender from Hai Baoshan, the owner of a copy shop at 501 Anyuan Road. After being reported to the Garrison Headquarters, he was arrested at the Nanjing Road Hui Zhong Hotel at 1 PM yesterday while the payment was being made. Zhang was wearing a military officer's uniform and carrying firearms. It is understood that on the evening of the 27th of last month, Zhang, along with another soldier and two men in Western suits, went to the aforementioned address and accused Hai of being suspected of drug trafficking, intending to arrest him. After someone interceded, the matter was settled with 50 million. Besides paying 30 million in cash on the spot, the remaining amount was scheduled to be paid yesterday afternoon at the Hui Zhong Hotel. When Zhang was arrested, he had just received a Jin Yuan Qian Zhuang check for 20 million with today's date from Hai's hand. Before he could examine it, he was stopped by the Garrison Headquarters personnel behind him, who drew their guns.

### The Mystery of the "Black Wind Fan": Government Agencies Request Allocation but Fail; However, It Appears on the Market

[Report from our newspaper] According to an official statement from the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (ERRRA), there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the rumor that the agency sold 7,500 surplus electric fans between May 23 and July 5, with 1,000 of them being preferentially purchased by various import and export companies, eventually flowing into the black market. It is said that these fans were all 110 volts, designed specifically for use on ships, and did not meet general needs. Therefore, on May 23, 500 units were sold to various import and export companies, followed by a public sale of 1,000 units. Upon hearing the news, people rushed to apply for purchase. As of July 5, a total of 7,500 units had been sold. At this time, the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA) suddenly notified the "ERRRA" that the stock of these fans was low, and the remaining units were reserved for the use of "UNRRA" and "ERRRA" themselves. The "ERRRA" immediately complied and stopped the allocation. There may have been improprieties in the handling of this matter, leading to the rumors. According to the "ERRRA", the allocation price of the electric fans was 400,000 yuan per unit, but currently, retailers in various shops and stalls seem to be selling them for 800,000 to 1.2 million yuan.

Furthermore, according to a report from the Hua Dong News Agency: The Finance Department of the Executive Yuan sold American-style wall-mounted 12-inch small fans last month and stopped the sale on the 3rd and 4th. Various government agencies and organizations rushed to request purchase, but were refused, claiming that they had been sold out. Surprisingly, this type of fan is being sold on the black market, priced at 600,000 or 800,000 per unit. According to the Executive Yuan's warehouse, there are more than 20,000 of these fans in total, and as of the day before yesterday, there were still more than 3,000 units in stock. Therefore, various parties have expressed dissatisfaction with the Finance Department of the Executive Yuan.

### "Flying Saucer" Descends: Determined to be a Climate Measurement Device; Takahashi and Tian Ye Pick Up One with Two Spheres, Each Like a Watermelon

[Report from our newspaper] The rumor that Takahashi obtained a "flying saucer" the day before yesterday spread widely and caused a sensation throughout the town, with everyone regarding it as a strange tale. Afterwards, the Takahashi Police Station took it back to the station for research. The result was that the so-called "flying saucer" was actually a type of "high-altitude measuring device."

Around 4 PM the day before yesterday, residents of the Huang Jia Wan area of Takahashi's First Bao spotted a white, luminous disc in the sky, drifting with the wind and falling into a field. Upon inspection, the so-called "flying saucer" was actually formed by two spheres, one blackish-brown and one silver-white, each about the size of a watermelon and made of rubber. Between the two spheres was a small white iron box about five inches square, containing a wireless radio. A small parachute was attached to the top. When the "flying saucer" was flying in the sky, the silver-white sphere at the bottom reflected sunlight, emitting a strong, dazzling white light. The letters "USA" were printed on it. Afterwards, according to an American technician from the Texas Oil Company in the area, this so-called "flying saucer" was actually a measuring device for measuring high-altitude climate. He had worked in an American meteorological instrument manufacturing factory for three years, so he knew this type of instrument very well and was sure it was not the "flying saucer" that the world was talking about.

### Owner of Hua Cheng Silk and Satin Dyeing Factory: Kidnapped While Visiting Buddha at Putuo; Rescued After Ten Days and Nights on a Bandit Ship and Returned to Shanghai; Four Monks and Temple Staff Suspected and Under Interrogation

[Report from our newspaper] It was rumored a few days ago that a wealthy businessman in this city was kidnapped in Putuo and a huge ransom was demanded, and it was rumored that the kidnapper was a certain abbot of a famous temple in this city. After much inquiry by reporters, the intricate and bizarre details of this kidnapping case have come to light. The details are recorded below:

Chen Jinliang, a native of Shaoxing, who resides at No. 9, Lane 762, Chengdu Road, in this city, is in his sixties and has been running the Hua Cheng Silk and Satin Dyeing Factory there for many years. He is usually devoutly Buddhist and has a close friendship with the former abbot of the Taiping Temple on Chengdu Road, Monk Mingjiao. Mingjiao has been retired for many years and has a close relationship with his teacher Zhen Da (80 years old) and his disciple Xing Kong (the current abbot). On June 30, Chen wanted to go to Putuo to conduct a water and land ceremony (a Buddhist ritual) to commemorate his deceased relatives. He made an appointment with Zhen Da and Xing Kong to take the "Hai Shen" to leave Shanghai. Since Taiping Temple is a sub-temple of the San Sheng Tang in Putuo, Chen's trip to Putuo was at the invitation of Xing Kong. Therefore, the temple specifically notified a temple staff member named "Xiao Xiang" before the trip, who specializes in picking up and dropping off pilgrims between Shanghai and Putuo, to come to Shanghai and accompany them as a guide.

On July 1, Chen and his party safely arrived at the San Sheng Tang in Putuo. From the 4th to the 11th, they performed a week-long ceremony. Chen's wife and daughter were also brought to Putuo by Xiao Xiang on the next ship from Shanghai. After the merit was completed, Chen led his wife and daughter to visit various temples to light incense and worship Buddha. On the 13th, they planned to wait for a ship to return to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, disaster struck, and an incident occurred that night. At 1 AM that night, the moon was dark, the wind was high, and the sea was surging. More than a dozen bandits suddenly appeared in front of the San Sheng Tang, each carrying modern weapons. They rushed over the wall with a roar and went straight to Chen's bedroom, pointing at Chen and asking who he was. Chen usually did not like to dress up, and at this time, the matter was urgent, and his two plain clothes made him look even less like a wealthy guest. He falsely claimed that he had been suffering from chronic illness and had come across the sea to seek medical treatment, hoping to find a magical formula for his illness. The bandits hesitated a little and were about to turn away. At this time, someone outside the door suddenly shouted in the darkness that Chen was a wealthy man from Shanghai and asked why they were waiting to act. The bandits, without thinking twice, immediately dragged Chen and others down the mountain and onto a small boat moored at the foot of the mountain. Chen knelt down and begged them to release his wife and daughter, but the bandits ignored him and put Chen and others in the bottom cabin. Because there was no ventilation, they were suffocating and about to die. They asked the bandits to open the hatch slightly. One bandit used his finger to dig a small hole in the top of the hatch. Chen tried his best to look out, but he only saw shadows of people and piles of boxes and luggage in the surrounding darkness, which were all the luggage that had been looted and boarded the ship.

When it was dawn, it was drizzling. The ship docked on an unnamed sandy beach, and the bandits took Chen and others into the mountains. The next evening, they forced them to board the ship again. Chen and others in the cabin only heard the sound of wind and waves hitting the ship, not knowing where they were going. It was not until the third day that they began negotiations in a jumble of strange rocks and mountains. At the beginning of the negotiations, the bandits called Chen the Chen boss of the rubber factory, but Chen strongly denied it. The bandits demanded 40 gold bars, but Chen only agreed to 3 small bars. In the end, the bandits lowered the price to 480 million in cash, and Chen increased it to 200 million, saying that if they could not reach an agreement, he would rather be killed at sea. Seeing that the situation could not be forced any further, the bandits agreed.

After the negotiations were completed, the bandits sent someone to the San Sheng Tang to contact the abbot Xing De (Xing Kong's teacher and brother), saying that if Xing De could take full responsibility for Chen, they and the San Sheng Tang would each send someone to Shanghai to collect the money. Because Xing De was not familiar with the situation in Shanghai, he refused. Xing Kong, motivated by righteousness, and realizing that Chen's trip to Putuo was at his invitation, and friendship was important, volunteered to go. The bandits also told him that he must be fully responsible for the payment and protection of the bandits after arriving in Shanghai. If there were any mistakes, Chen's life would be in danger, and the San Sheng Tang would be razed to the ground. After an agreement was reached, Xing Kong accompanied a bandit to Shanghai on the 19th to notify Chen's family, who collected 100 million in cash and 3 large gold bars, and handed them over. On the 21st, the bandit leader received the full amount. At the same time, since Chen was kidnapped on the 14th, he was still escorted by the bandits on a ship every night, moving through various mountains. It was not until the 23rd that they ordered Xing De to come to the bandit's lair to issue a guarantee and release Chen and others. At that time, the Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities, because the sea area of Putuo was not peaceful, were preparing to launch a suppression campaign. The bandits, seeing the urgent situation, waited for a civilian ship to approach the shore, drove Chen and others off the ship, sailed to Shenjiamen in Dinghai, and changed ships to Ningbo, where they met with their family members who were waiting in Ningbo and came to Shanghai. On the 25th, the San Sheng Tang notified the Hua Cheng Dyeing Factory by long-distance telephone that Chen and others had returned to Shanghai on a China Merchants Bureau ship. Before this, the Xin Cheng Police Station had already sent officers to monitor the telephone related to the dyeing factory after the case occurred. At this point, they led a large number of police officers to ambush at the China Merchants Bureau wharf. When the ship docked, they intercepted Chen and others, and at the same time arrested Xing Kong, Xiao Xiang, Xing Xian (also a monk from the San Sheng Tang), and another temple staff member who had been dismissed from the San Sheng Tang and returned to Shanghai, Zhou Shengquan, on another ship that arrived at the same time. All four were taken to the police station for interrogation.

It is understood that a few days after this case occurred, there was news that three Shanghai benefactors in Putuo Guangfu Temple were suddenly kidnapped during a water and land ceremony. The great Buddhist environment is about to become a Shura hell.

He took an express train back to Beijing at 11 PM on the 3rd, accompanied by Peng Weiren, Director of the Supervisory Bureau, and others. Before his departure, Qin met with reporters from the Central News Agency and said that during his two days in Shanghai, he listened to reports and opinions from various parties regarding the case and would submit a comprehensive report to President Chiang. The investigation of this case is more important than the trial. Now that the investigation has been completed, the trial can be held in Shanghai within one or two days. The form of the trial will be that the military court will try the military personnel, and the judicial organs will try the non-military personnel.

### Postmaster Li Jinlu Broadcasts: Basic Viewpoints of Postal Service: Serving the Public is the Blood Vessel, Not Profiting from the Public

[Report from our newspaper] This newspaper held the 18th Sunday Special Broadcast at the China Cultural Radio Station yesterday, inviting Li Jinlu, Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau, to broadcast "Basic Viewpoints of Postal Service." The following is a record of the main points of his speech:

The postal system started earliest in our country. According to historical records, as early as the early Zhou Dynasty, there were rudimentary post stations. During the Han and Tang Dynasties, post pavilions and stations were all over the official roads. This system was most developed. However, the establishment of the modern postal service is only 50 years old. It was initially managed by the customs, and it was not until the third year of Xuantong that the General Post Office was established to operate independently.

Dong Zhongshu, a great Confucian scholar of the Han Dynasty, said: "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit, clarify its principles without calculating its merit." I now want to "take it out of context" and apply this sentence to the postal service. "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit" can be said to be the inherent characteristic of public enterprises such as the post office, and "clarify its principles without calculating its merit" can be said to be the virtue that postal personnel should possess.

Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit

Why is "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit" the inherent characteristic of public enterprises? We know that among all public enterprises, the post office is closest to the public. From big cities to remote villages, from high officials to peddlers, everyone has social relations and everyone needs communication. The postal service is an institution set up to facilitate the public. Therefore, the post office should be the people's post office, the post office of everyone who uses the post office. The purpose of this institution is to serve the public, not to profit from the public. If there is a surplus in business, the surplus should be used to promote work and improve facilities. In other words, what is taken from the people should be used for the people. Advanced countries in the world adopt the postal economic independence system, which is also the meaning of this. Our China cannot do this. Due to traffic obstacles, social instability, huge expenses, and sharp decline in income, by May this year, the national postal economic loss has reached 206.94 billion. Insufficient postal charges, we cannot but rely on government subsidies. However, we are not getting subsidies to survive, but actively using them to improve facilities and promote business. In a word, it is used in undertakings that benefit the public. As long as this thing should be done, we will do it, "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit." We are not only not seeking its profit, but also losing a lot of money, because we believe that the postal service is to serve the public and should take the interests of the public as the premise.

Clarify its principles without calculating its merit

Why is "Clarify its principles without calculating its merit" the virtue that postal personnel should possess? This reason is very simple. Since the post office is a service institution, postal personnel must take service as their mission. Postal personnel must pass strict examinations when entering the bureau to be employed. This is the initial test of whether they can be competent. After entering the bureau, due to the strictness of the reward and punishment assessment system, they are always improving while working and learning. Postal personnel have a common spirit, which is "Treat the post office as home." At present, those who have entered the bureau for eight or ten years are considered junior personnel. Those who have served for nearly 40 years, like myself, are everywhere. Since we regard the post office as a lifelong career, we must love the post office, study the post office, and understand the mission that the post office bears to the public. In the past year, the post office has worked hard in extremely difficult circumstances, and it has also been inspired by this spirit. We are willing to accept all criticisms and thank all parties for their past cooperation. As the saying goes: "The task is heavy and the road is long." The road is still long, and the night for us to explore is also long. Looking forward to the future, we hope that the public will continue to give us guidance and support so that this undertaking for the people can achieve greater and further development.

### All Circles Hold Military Service Propaganda Conference: "Nation Building Must First Build the Military"; A Song "Joining the Army"

Lyrics written by Pan Gongzhan seeking a composer to set to music

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Military Service Propaganda Conference was held at Lidu Garden, Taixing Road, at 10 AM yesterday. More than 500 representatives from the literary, news, drama, film, and broadcasting circles attended. Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Fu Zhengmo, Zhang Xiaosong, and others formed the presidium. A letter to all compatriots and the main points of propaganda were also published. At the beginning of the conference, Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Military Service Association, delivered a speech, stating briefly that Shanghai is the largest city in our country, and this is the first time that military service is being handled. The success or failure of this will have a significant impact on future military administration. Shanghai has made great contributions to the country in the past, from the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition to the "January 28th Incident" and the "August 13th Incident," it has made brilliant contributions in history. Now, at the critical moment of nation-building, the Communist bandits are causing chaos, and the government's implementation of the military service system to seek permanent stability for the country is necessary. Some people mistakenly believe that Shanghai is a city of enjoyment, and that promoting military administration will be difficult, but in fact, the citizens of Shanghai are the most righteous. For this conscription, the central government has specially approved the conscription of 3,000 volunteers first. Given Shanghai's past contributions to the country, it is expected that it will be completed smoothly voluntarily. Then, Fu Zhengmo, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, delivered a speech, reporting that the district under his jurisdiction includes Shanghai and thirteen other counties. A total of 11,000 people will be conscripted. According to the population ratio, Shanghai should conscript 6,000 people. The central government considers Shanghai to be a commercial and industrial area, so it has reduced the number by half to 3,000, and volunteers will be conscripted first. Shanghai has a high cultural level, accurate household registration, and a strong patriotic consciousness among its citizens, so military administration is easier to implement. The Civil Affairs Bureau is now preparing various tasks, and training will begin after the new conscription camp is completed. Student military training will be implemented from the next semester and will also be the responsibility of the garrison district. Again, Fang Wei Bian, a member of the Military Service Propaganda Committee, gave a speech, explaining that the military service propaganda methods have been formulated. Conscription today is to protect the country. If the country can be protected, the family can also be safe. Fang also put forward anti-bureaucratization of military service, anti-degradation of military service, anti-commercialization of military service, and support for democratization of military service. He called on all citizens to actively participate in military service, and hoped that Kuomintang members would encourage their children to serve in the military, take the lead, protect the country, and eliminate the source of chaos. Subsequently, Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the City, as the organizer of military service, requested assistance from all sectors at any time. If any of his subordinates commit corruption in handling military administration, he also hopes that all sectors will report the facts and will be severely punished. Zhang also gave a detailed report on the conscription steps, volunteers and preferential treatment issues. Again, Xu Jilun and Sun Choucheng and Sun Xiangzhong, who were volunteers 40 years ago, gave speeches one after another. Then the entertainment began, Zhou Xuan broadcasted and sang famous songs such as "Golden God Dances in the Autumn Wind" and "Night Fragrance," and then the conference ended in high spirits.

[Another report] Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Military Service Association, wrote a song "Good Man, Join the Army" on the spot at yesterday's conference, welcoming composers to set it to music, and the association will give a generous reward. The lyrics are as follows: "Good man, join the army, nation building must first build the military, war without courage is not filial, holding a spear to defend the country is a good citizen, a great and powerful new China, the youth army is the vanguard for the people, parents, wives, brothers, sisters, relatives and friends send them off together, joyfully enter the camp, protect the country, protect the乡and protect the home, to be a hero, first join the army, good man, join the army, good man, join the army."

### Tianlong Lun Completed and Sailed; Sailed to South Sakhalin Island Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] Our country's shipping industry has actively planned to expand overseas routes after the victory. The China Merchants Bureau's China-India Line and China-Japan Line have already been opened, and the China-U.S. San Francisco Line is also being planned. The China Shipping Company's Tianlong Lun, with a total tonnage of 10,473 tons, was originally the Niels Maersk of the Maersk Company. After being purchased by the China Shipping Company, it was renamed Tianlong and has been operating on the coastal and Nanyang lines for more than a year. Recently, it has completed its annual maintenance and is said to have been chartered by a British merchant from London. It left Shanghai yesterday and first sailed to South Sakhalin Island to load 4,500 tons of paper, of which 2,500 tons will be unloaded in Marseille and 2,000 tons will be shipped to England. The ship's outbound procedures have been completed, and the crew has been vaccinated by the seaport quarantine station. It is also understood that after loading paper from Sakhalin Island and sailing to Europe, it will still need to go to Shanghai. After the ship goes to England, it will regularly sail on the Atlantic British-American route and will not return to China for the time being. According to the company, the lease is for more than one year, and it is scheduled to return to China in November next year. After the ship returns to China, the company will operate its own foreign routes. A national ship chartered to Europe and sailing on the Atlantic Ocean can be called a new record in our country's shipping industry.

### Conflict with Butchers While Cooling Off: Homicide Occurs on Liú Hé Road

[Our Newspaper's Report] A male corpse with eight apparent stab wounds was discovered yesterday morning near the side of Liú Hé Road by the back gate of Lǎ Gé Nà Elementary School, now renamed the Fifth Central National School, on Huáng Hé Road. Upon receiving the report, the Sōng Shān Police Precinct promptly dispatched officers to investigate. It was learned that the deceased was named Tāng Dé Fā, 30 years old, formerly a police officer at the Cháng Shú Road Police Station. He had been dismissed last winter and was temporarily residing at the Star Hotel, No. 40 Liú Hé Road. Around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Tāng was cooling off in front of the hotel due to the heat when, coincidentally, a noodle stall was set up at the intersection on the east side. A certain rickshaw puller, Mr. Jiǎ, parked his rickshaw in the middle of the road and began eating at the noodle stall. At the same time, a "wild pheasant" (reckless individual) riding a tricycle accidentally overturned a tofu stand while turning a corner. The vendor grabbed him and demanded compensation. Six or seven butchers from the cattle slaughtering company, who were eating at the noodle stall, seeing this, stepped forward to harass the "wild pheasant." Tāng, witnessing everything, objected to the butchers' actions and argued with them. He was immediately surrounded and severely beaten, causing him to bleed from his mouth and nose. The perpetrators then scattered. Tāng crawled to that location and died from his injuries. The Sōng Shān Police Precinct is currently pursuing the suspects.

### Robbery of Residents on Jīn Líng Road

[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, two thieves broke into the home of Shǐ Yǒng Líng at No. 35 Bā Xiān Fāng, Jīn Líng Road, and, wielding guns, robbed him of gold and silver jewelry worth over 50 million. They then fled. The case has been reported to the relevant Sài Precinct for investigation and apprehension.

### Indictment of Wáng Yǒng Kāng: Participation in the Communist Army and Murder

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wáng Yǒng Kāng, a native of Cháng Zhōu, resided at No. 38 Sōng Mào Lane, Pseudo Pān Road. In 1942, Wáng joined the New Fourth Army in Cháng Zhōu and served as the vice-chairman of the Yì Chén Relief Association. Subsequently, due to a conflict with Lǐ Bǐng Dà, who was in charge of tax affairs for the New Fourth Army, on the evening of June 19th, 1945 (lunar calendar), Wáng, together with a lewd monk, Shěn Zǔ Tóu, Wáng Zǐ Liáng, and others, strangled Lǐ Bǐng Dà to death with hemp rope. Recently, he fled to Shàng Hǎi and was reported to the Yáng Shù Pǔ Police Precinct, who detained him and transferred him to the High Procuratorate for investigation. After investigation by the prosecutor, it was determined that the New Fourth Army was a bandit force organized by traitors, illegally occupying land and betraying the central government, and had long been ordered to disband by the government. The defendant served as vice-chairman in the agricultural relief association established by the bandits and had committed murder. Therefore, he is guilty under Article 100, Paragraph 1, Article 271, Paragraph 1, and Article 28 of the Criminal Code, and a public prosecution is initiated in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Lú Yīng's Sworn Brotherhood: Hú Bǎo Xiáng Suspected of Crimes

The High Procuratorate Has Filed a Public Prosecution

[Our Newspaper's Report] Hú Bǎo Xiáng, father of Hú Chéng, a team leader in the enemy gendarmerie, served as an inspector in the Shàng Hǎi Municipal Police Bureau before the war and was a sworn brother of Lú Yīng, the former captain of the bureau's Detective Team. During the enemy puppet regime, Lú Yīng became the deputy director of the puppet Shàng Hǎi Municipal Police Bureau, and Hú Bǎo Xiáng served as the puppet inspector-general of the bureau. Later, he fell out with Lú Yīng and was reassigned as a major adjutant in the puppet Security Command. The First Branch of the Hé Běi High Court transferred the case to the High Procuratorate of this city for investigation. Based on the suspicion that Hú committed crimes under Article 2, Paragraph 2, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, a public prosecution has been initiated according to law.

### Everyone Has a Father: Preparations for Father's Day Celebration Approaching August 8th

Father's Day, August 8th, is fast approaching. The Promotion Committee, composed of Pān Gōng Zhǎn, Wú Jìng Héng, Lǐ Shí Zēng, Yán Huì Qìng, Qián Yǒng Míng, Dù Yuè Shēng, Chéng Zhōng Xíng, Xú Jì Kāng, and others, believes that honoring one's parents and repaying their kindness is profoundly meaningful and especially important in these troubled times. Therefore, upholding the spirit of last year's enthusiastic national commemoration, they have, after several consultations, finalized the following plan: (1) Soliciting essays titled "My Father." From the date of the announcement in the newspaper, July 14th, until the 21st, over two thousand submissions were received from people across the country. After evaluation, the winning essays were those of Chén Sòng Píng, Zhāng Shàng Zhū, Liú Qǐ Fèng, Xiè Kāi Dé, and others, totaling fifteen essays, and three poems by Wèi Bīng Xīn, Zhōu Zài Xíng, Zhōng Rú Zhōu and others. Prizes will be awarded on August 8th, and all winning entries will be published in the "Children's Stories" monthly magazine published by the Children's Book Bureau for commemoration. (2) Radio speeches. The winners of the previous Mandarin speech contest organized by the Education Bureau, three from each of the elementary, middle, and high school groups, were specially invited to write an essay titled "My Thoughts on Father's Day" and broadcast it on the radio at 9:00 AM on the 8th. Chén Qīng Shí was invited as the judge, and all participants will receive valuable gifts. (3) Family ceremonies. Everyone has a father, and everyone should respect their father. Therefore, the association advocates that each family must commemorate Father's Day individually. For example, at 9:00 AM on the 8th, children should wear red flowers and pay their respects to their parents with speeches (those whose fathers have passed away should wear white flowers and pay respects to their portraits). Those whose parents are in their hometowns or far away should send letters or telegrams to express their filial piety. Families should also hold symposiums, plays, banquets, and present gifts to commemorate the day, enjoying family happiness and increasing family fun, which is meaningful both publicly and privately. (4) Holding a commemorative meeting. The association has scheduled a commemorative ceremony for 9:00 AM on Father's Day at the Youth Association Auditorium. Yán Huì Qìng will deliver a speech, and Pān Gōng Zhǎn will present awards (to the essay and speech contestants). A movie will also be screened for a grand celebration. All are welcome to attend freely. (5) Expanding publicity. In addition to asking major businesses to donate over ten roadside billboards for advertisements, all major movie theaters will show slides starting today, and the Shēn Bào has been entrusted to ask all Shàng Hǎi radio stations to broadcast in advance. Large white banners will be hung in central urban areas, slogans will be posted along the roads, public military vehicles will display slogans, and major cities and newspapers will be requested to publish news and write editorials, spreading the message as widely as possible to deeply root it in the hearts of the people. (6) Selling commemorative flowers. The association has commissioned the Youth Association to lead 500 impoverished middle and high school students to sell specially made commemorative flowers along the streets on the 7th and 8th, with the proceeds used for student aid.

### The Overlord Flaps Its Wings and Roars: Reporters Fly in Formation: A Brief Jaunt Over Háng Zhōu Bay

[Our Newspaper's Report] To expand its international air routes, China National Aviation Corporation recently added six new DC-4 "Skymaster" giant aircraft. To introduce the performance and equipment of these new aircraft to the outside world, the company openly invited the press of this city for a test flight yesterday afternoon. Nearly a hundred people went to participate in the test flight, drawn by the name of the "Overlord," three times the number invited by the company, which shows the general excitement. They were divided into two batches, with the destination being a round trip over Háng Zhōu Bay. The actual time spent flying each round trip was only forty minutes, but the takeoff and landing took more than twenty minutes because of the large size of the aircraft.

The "Skymaster," as its name implies, has tremendous power. The entire fuselage is silver-white, with four giant engines, each with a three-bladed propeller.

No Number 13 Seat

The fuselage is about twice as large as that of ordinary single-engine passenger planes. The cabin has forty-four seats, each numbered, but seat number 13 is notably absent, presumably due to its association with bad luck, and number 45 is the last seat. The seat cushions and backs are covered with exquisite foam rubber, which is more elastic than ordinary spring sofas. The armrests are equipped with buttons, and with a slight touch, the seat back can be extended to a certain angle as desired. Sitting upright in it is soft and comfortable. Moreover, due to the large size of the plane and the smooth flight, one does not initially realize that they are soaring above six thousand feet. The cockpit is located at the front of the aircraft. A first officer and a pilot sit side by side, chatting and laughing casually while flying. There is also a radio operator to maintain constant radio contact with the ground. It is said that if one or two of the four engines fail during flight, the other engines will continue to operate until a safe landing is achieved.

Air Hostesses as Companions

In addition, each plane is accompanied by two "air hostesses." Those accompanying yesterday were Lán Huì Lán and Hé Shū Zhēn, both from Guǎng Dōng. Both young ladies are graceful and lithe, fluent in both the Shàng Hǎi and Guǎng Dōng dialects, and proficient in English. Long-distance passengers will have all travel fatigue disappear under the careful care of these "air hostesses".

The Overlord hovered in the sky over Shàng Hǎi for only ten minutes, and the myriad facets of this great international city were already fully visible. Looking around, one could see red-tiled roofs everywhere, with the Broadway Mansion, International Hotel, and other large buildings resembling toy blocks. The Pǔ River curved like a ribbon, with sailboats dotting the water and warships appearing like models.

The Fields Stretch Green Without End

Once out of the city, one could see crisscrossing fields and endless green pastures. After another ten minutes, we were over Háng Zhōu Bay, a vast expanse of ripples with only three lush islands standing tall in the middle. In the distance, a thin mist shrouded the scene, blurring the line between the water and the sky. Suddenly, the fuselage tilted slightly, and the plane turned back towards home. After another twenty minutes, the fuselage had reached the setting sun and slowly landed on the newly constructed, wide cement runway at Lóng Huá Airport. Throughout the entire journey, none of the passengers felt unwell, nor were there any instances of vomiting, which alone seems sufficient to indicate the unique performance of the "Skymaster."

### The Big Family of the Youth Army: A Summer Camp Is Being Held in Jiā Xīng

This summer, the Preparatory Cadre Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense is holding summer camps in Běi Píng and Jiā Xīng, notifying military youth from various universities to participate, taking advantage of the students' summer vacation to relive the old dream of reunion and spend a pleasant summer life together.

The Jiā Xīng summer camp is personally presided over by Jiǎng Jīng Guó, director of the Preparatory Cadre Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The number of registered students has reached 1,335, including 13 female students. Some of them came from Lán Zhōu, Shěn Yáng, Cháng Chūn, and some came from Tái Wān, Yuè Nán. Kūn Míng, Chéng Dū, Chóng Qìng, and others have also rushed to participate. The Yáng Zǐ River Basin naturally has the largest number of people. The students are from universities and colleges across the country, according to the reporter's statistics: a total of 89 units, with the most students from Northwest University, a total of 94 people, and there are still students from the school on the way, who will arrive in Jiā Xīng within days.

The Northwest University camp used to be the location of the Jiā Xīng Youth Corps of the Youth Army, and now it is full of the sounds of young partners. At six o'clock in the morning, under the gaze of thousands of eyes, the bright national flag slowly rises to the top of the flagpole, and a day of tense life begins immediately, lasting until lights out at 10:30 in the evening. There is a high water tower, tidy barracks, clean classrooms and a large playground in the camp. Trees are planted all over the camp, with willow-lined paths. A few steps into the camp gate, you can see a wooden sign standing on the side of the road, with white characters on a red background, writing the words "We use summer vacation to exercise our bodies, review our homework, strengthen unity, and serve the society." This is the purpose of the cadre bureau holding the summer camp, and it is also the criterion for the lives of all students.

Lecturers who have come to the camp or are about to come to the camp include Zhú Kě Zhēn, Liú Chéng, and Dǒng Xǐ Fán for modern science, Zuǒ Lù Shēng for modern political thought, Lǐ Shòu Yōng for the current situation in China, Hé Hào Zháo for Chinese economy, Zhāng Yào Xiáng for youth psychology, Xiè Xún Chū for social psychology, Xú Péi Gēn for national defense construction, Ruǎn Yì Chéng for constitutional research, Tú Zhèn Chuān for an overview of physical education, Hú Chāng Qí for American life, Chén Lì Fū for the teachings of President Sūn, Dèng Wén Yí for the words and deeds of the leader, Zhèng Yàn Fēn for Chinese politics, Xú Fú Guān for the Chinese revolution and party issues, Guàn Yì Bīn for the preparatory cadre system, and Jiǎng Jīng Guó will be the speaker on youth issues.

### The Nán Jīng Municipal Council: Defeats the Toilet Tax

[Our Newspaper's Report from Nán Jīng] The toilet tax proposal was the most eye-catching item at the recent meeting of the Nán Jīng Municipal Council. The word "toilet" has become a special term in Nán Jīng. A toilet tax is especially rare in the world. No wonder the councilors brought it up, which is really a finale scene. The question was raised by Zhào Xìn Chén, who requested the assembly to deny the hard collection of a 5,000 yuan toilet tax per unit by the Feces Management Office. It was seconded by Liú Shǒu Yīng and twelve others, but after the proposal was discussed, the councilors expressed their opinions one after another, and the debate was very intense. One or two councilors even slammed the table and roared, and the order of the meeting was very chaotic. Chairman Chén was almost at a loss. Zhào Xìn Chén, Liú Shǒu Yīng, Xià Shí, Wú Fèng Míng, Zhāng Wén Bó, and others firmly advocated that the collection should be stopped immediately, and that the collection of the toilet tax without review by the council was illegal, and those who had been collected should be refunded as soon as possible. If the municipal government has already collected a cleaning tax, it feels too harsh and miscellaneous. Some people said that the Feces Management Office is a contractor system, which is contracted by the "King of Feces". They can eat feces, use feces, and collect feces, so what does the Health Bureau manage? Why not take it back and do it yourself? However, Wú Yán Qí, Gù Fù Chū, and others who held the opposite view, said that this charge is not in the nature of a "donation", but a fee for brushing toilets on behalf of the people, which is cheaper than employing a servant to brush it. It should be recognized, and the Feces Management Office can be instructed to try it for three months to wash away the shame of "stinky Nán Jīng". However, the opposition immediately refuted it, using the excuse of brushing the toilet on behalf of the people, but asking which family's toilet was brushed by them, and each household has a nanny to clean the toilet, even if there is no nanny, it is brushed by the old woman herself, so why bother them to do it for them? Moreover, according to the custom of Nán Jīng, the feces of a certain household are collected by the vegetable garden, and in the autumn, they are still sent pickled vegetables as thanks. Now that the feces have been taken away, it is unreasonable to collect fees again. Wú Fèng Míng also stood up and shouted loudly: "Who ordered the collection of the toilet tax? Who entrusted the brushing?" The original proposer, Zhào Xìn Chén, also shouted wildly: "When councilors are campaigning for votes, they all use speaking for the people as publicity. Now they are speaking for the contractors, where is their conscience?" Later, Zhāng Wén Bó suggested: (1) The municipal government should formulate appropriate methods for handling feces and send them to the council for review. (2) Before the above methods are formulated, the municipal government shall order that the "toilet tax" be stopped immediately and all those collected be refunded. (3) If the Feces Management Office collects toilet taxes and there is suspicion of fraud, the municipal government should investigate and send it to the court for handling. As a result, it was passed by a majority vote. This farce of "the preliminary of people's rights" has come to a temporary end. (Special Correspondent Dīng Kuāng Huá)

### Large Clam Harvested in Dàn Shuǐ Pond, Jīn Huá: Weighs 18 Market Pounds

[Our Newspaper's Report from Jīn Huá] There is a place called Qián Pond in Zázhù Village, Jiāng Xiǎo Township, this county. The water is very deep and has never dried up for many years.

### Digging Ponds to Fill Ponds: People of Sōng Express Opposition

[Our Newspaper's Report from Sōng Jiāng] The Jīn Shān Zuǐ seawall in Sōng Jiāng was originally a barrier for the north of the seawall. After the first phase of the dangerous project was completed, the second phase of the project has been carrying out soil filling work. However, the Engineering Office came up with a whimsical idea to use the road construction locomotives of the Engineering Bureau to dig mud on the seawall surface at both the east and west ends of the new pond, causing the original pond body to become a depression of more than a foot deep and more than a mile long. The harm of digging ponds to fill ponds is obvious. What is even worse is that there are two or three layers of old piles outside the new pond. Although they have been broken and peeled off, they are still very effective in resisting huge waves. Now they are ordered to be sawn off by workers, so the County Seawall Committee, in addition to questioning the Engineering Office, also sent a letter to the Jiāng Nán Seawall Engineering Association to appeal, and the people of Sōng also expressed their opposition.

### Three Evils of Sichuan: Opium, Bandits, and Gelaohui

— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan

Chengdu, July 28th (Air Dispatch)

This year is the year of total eradication of opium in Sichuan. The last phase of the anti-opium work should have ended last month, but what is the opium situation in Sichuan this year? At the opening of the Provincial Council, Chairman Deng Xihou gave an impassioned speech, determined to eradicate the three evils of Sichuan – opium, bandits, and Gelaohui. Councilors from all over the province angrily reported on the opium situation, which was sad, lamentable, infuriating, and hateful. Councilor Chen Rangqing estimated that there are currently 14 opium-affected areas in the province, each consuming an average of 5.2 billion yuan worth of opium per month, totaling 8.736 trillion yuan per year for the entire province. What an alarming figure! Ouyang Jie said that opium is widespread in eastern Sichuan, and the Chongqing-Wanxian highway and all the water and land docks along the Jialing River have become distribution centers for opium. Jin Xiaogeng said that government opium suppression personnel use fake opium to replace real opium when submitting it, and the investigators dare not even report sedan chair carriers smoking opium, let alone declare that they are investigators, or else no one will carry the chair. Lou Yuanliang asked if the provincial government knew that the Wanyuan-Xuanhan security team was selling opium. Wu Jieping asked why the provincial government did not question the county magistrate and security commander of Wangcang County, who were collaborating to sell opium. Peng Wangping even loudly urged Chairman Deng to discuss with Chairman Liu of Xikang to plant less opium in Xikang. These heartfelt statements represent the public opinion of the 50 million people of Sichuan. The enlightened provincial government will not deny the seriousness of the opium problem in Sichuan today, and also sincerely stated that "heavy punishments should be used in chaotic times" and is willing to "borrow heads to eliminate the opium scourge." Today, the key to opium suppression in Sichuan lies in "doing rather than just talking." We believe in the provincial government's determination to suppress opium, but the issue lies in the thoroughness of implementation. This year is the year of total opium eradication, and also the year of total mobilization. Whether the opium scourge that has plagued the country for centuries can be eradicated depends on the determination of the authorities!

As for the bandits and "muddy water Gelaohui," which are the other two of the three evils of Sichuan, they are the two major tumors that have harmed society in Sichuan for years, and are a vicious obstacle to social order. In mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, stability in the rear should be the top priority, but the security situation in Sichuan this year is not yet optimistic. In the Provincial Council, councilors actively questioned the Director of the Security Department on security issues. Chen Zhijian asked if the Provincial Pacification Headquarters had a plan to eradicate the bandit leader Qu Beijie, who has been rampant for years in the area bordering Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Peng. Zhou Gang asked if the Provincial Pacification Headquarters was determined to completely eradicate the area bordering Sichuan, Kang, and Shaanxi in the 16th District, which has been a breeding ground for opium and bandits for years, in order to cooperate with opium suppression. Shao Yiyang said that grassroots politics are unsound, and local security teams often collude with township chiefs to protect opium, gambling, and condone thieves. Liu Ding and Li Minghe both spoke up for the security teams, saying that security soldiers only receive three shi of rice and 16,000 yuan for food per month, which is not enough to maintain their livelihood, so how can they provide security?

The so-called "muddy water Gelaohui" are a mixture of local tyrants, evil gentry, illegal elements, and special forces in society. They often use special powers to engage in various illegal activities, committing all kinds of crimes. Opium, bandits, and "muddy water Gelaohui" form a tripod, forming the three evils of Sichuan society today. The Provincial Pacification Headquarters has spared no effort in maintaining security over the years. Chairman Deng and the Director of the Security Department have also explained the importance of security and the determination to suppress bandits. Frankly speaking, the security situation this year has improved significantly compared to last year, but the problem is that it has not yet been coordinated with the general mobilization!

Mobilizing to suppress the rebellion is another major responsibility of Sichuan to the country after the war of resistance against Japan. The prerequisite for mobilization is social stability. Before mobilization, we would like to extract practical ways to govern Sichuan from the introduction of the current political, educational, and social situation in Sichuan by the councilors at the final meeting of the Sichuan Provincial Council.

### Less Than Half of Elementary and Middle School Students in Peiping Have No Diseases

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] The Peiping Education and Health Bureaus previously conducted a general check-up on elementary school students in this cultural city, proving that less than half of the students have no diseases. Among the diseases, trachoma is the most common, accounting for 19.9% of all students, the reason being that Peiping has a lot of wind and sand, and towels are used indiscriminately.

The full text has been sent to the "Children's Story" monthly magazine published by the Children's Bookstore and will be published on the 8th of this month for reference.

### National Construction School of Law and Commerce: Still Growing

— Xia

Ninghai Road in Nanjing is already a fairly quiet street, and turning north into Kuanglu Road is even more sparsely populated, like entering the countryside. This place, with fresh air and far from the noise of the city, is an excellent environment for studying. National Construction School of Law and Commerce stands in this ideal setting.

Speaking of the school's history, it is still very young, but it has already established six departments: Law, Politics, Economics, Cooperation, Business Administration, and Accounting and Banking, and is affiliated with the Land Administration Research Institute. The founders are Zhang Ji, a member of the Central Committee, and Xiao Zheng, the former Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs. Xiao resigned from his position as Deputy Minister in order to devote himself to education. When the school held its opening ceremony last semester, he declared to the students very firmly: "I am running a school to cultivate real talents that society urgently needs. This school is not a diploma mill, so don't expect to be able to buy a diploma here with money..." After hearing this, some students were happy and some were sad, but I believe that the happy people will definitely be the majority, because in any school, bad students are ultimately very few, and most people hope to gain more real knowledge during the four years of university to lay the foundation for serving society in the future.

As proven by the facts of the past six months, President Xiao has not neglected his advocacy for a moment, which can be seen from the exams. The supervisors were extremely strict during the summer exams, and students who cheated were punished accordingly, some with demerits and some with expulsion. In fact, strict exams should be the minimum requirement for every school for students, because cheating in exams during student days fosters a mentality of speculation, which will easily lead to corruption and violations of the law when they enter society. In our country, where there are many out-of-school youth who cannot be accommodated by schools, it is better to grit your teeth and eliminate students who do not study and fool around in school, rather than tolerate evil, so as to leave space for young people who are willing to study. However, for anything, rewards and punishments must be used together to achieve greater results. National Construction School of Law and Commerce has established a reward method for students with excellent academic performance: those who have good conduct and a total average grade of 80 or above in the semester will be exempted from tuition fees for the next semester, those with 90 or above will be exempted from miscellaneous fees, and those with 95 or above will not pay any fees for the next semester (including all expenses such as meals and accommodation). This shows the school authorities' earnest expectations for young students. The professors hired are all authoritative scholars at home and abroad, such as Lin Bin, Yang Youjiong, Fu Tongxian, Lou Tongshen, Shou Miancheng, Ren Zhuoxuan, Tang Huisun, Bao Decheng, Wan Guoding, Mei Zhongxie, Zhang Pijie, Wu Shuchang, Fan Renyu, and Li Qinglin. Director of Academic Affairs Yang Youjiong is not only a domestic legal expert, but also was selected as one of the fourteen legal authorities in the world. The 1946 World Almanac has detailed records of his life and works. In order to improve students' English proficiency and increase opportunities for practical conversation practice, foreign professors will be hired next semester, and if necessary, the English learning time will be increased to ensure that everyone can actually apply it.

The guidance department adopts a laissez-faire system, only guiding or persuading students for inappropriate actions, and not resorting to rigid sanctions unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, the air in the school is very free, and wall newspapers are like bamboo shoots after rain, expressing their opinions and dazzling the eye. Invisibly, a atmosphere of mutual competition and unwillingness to lag behind has been cultivated in academic thought. The guidance office's implementation of this strategy has resulted in unexpected success.

We often see news in the newspapers about private schools requesting permission from the education authorities to increase tuition fees, and there was a time when the situation was serious and rumors of teacher strikes spread. National Construction College is not like this. On the contrary, they (the school authorities) are planning for students everywhere. Within the possible range, they will never increase fees. Taking tuition as an example, it was 300,000 yuan last semester, and it has been decided to maintain the original amount next semester. Everyone knows how crazy prices have risen in the past six months, but the tuition fee remains the same. Old students will only pay more than 500,000 yuan each next semester. This is indeed a very convenient over度given to the students by a school with no external financial aid.

Due to the surge in the number of students, the school buildings are insufficient. It is planned to complete a large auditorium and classrooms and dormitories that can accommodate 1,000 to 2,000 people during the summer vacation. Because according to the established plan, the college departments will be expanded, a graduate school will be added, and it will be reorganized into National Construction University. This summer's admissions will be held in both Beijing and Shanghai. The exams will be held on August 9th and 10th (the Shanghai office is located at the City Council on Tanggu Road in this city). Each department will enroll 50 new students, and it is expected that the number will increase by several hundred again next semester.

National Construction School of Law and Commerce, although still in the growth stage, shows that it has all the conditions for healthy development. We expect it to grow quickly, and perhaps in today's extremely poor educational world, we can see the brilliance of its efforts.

### Industrial Association and Other Groups Fight for Quota Allocation Rights

Decided to Submit Six Suggestions to the Central Authorities

[Our Report] The Industrial Association held a press conference at the Cishu Building Star Five Dinner Party at 3 pm yesterday to report on the industrial raw material quota allocation rights and the process of the review committee failing to reach an agreement due to the lack of sincerity of commercial trade associations. First, Tian Heqing, the executive director of the Industrial Association, reported the following four points of the industrial sector's opinions on the issue of industrial raw materials:

(1) Industrial essential raw materials should be directly allocated to factories to reduce the exploitation of middlemen at all levels, so as to increase production, reduce production costs, and curb and stabilize prices, and cooperate with national policies. At the same time, the foreign exchange paid by the government can be used to achieve the highest effect. (2) The goods ordered by importers are for the purpose of making huge profits, and do not fully meet the needs of the industrial sector. Direct access to raw materials by the industrial sector can eliminate black market malpractices. (3) The quota allocation office does not handle matters thoroughly, and the government's control policy is not thorough. (4) The industrial sector does not hope that the raw material import quota will increase quarter by quarter. On the contrary, it hopes that it will be reduced to stimulate domestic production of raw materials and establish necessary heavy industries.

Then, Pan Shihao, a director of the Industrial Association, reported the failure of the distribution review meeting, and the commercial trade association and the Export Control Commission quota allocation office should be held responsible. From April 24 to July 30, after 16 small group allocation meetings, the internal allocation of chemical raw materials, pigments, and hardware, the three most important items, by the industrial association has been successfully completed, but in the end, the commercial association refused to attend, resulting in the failure of the allocation agreement. The industrial sector is deeply saddened by this. The crux of the dispute is the irrationality of the government's foreign exchange policy and trade policy, which has caused friction between industry and commerce and disputes over the illegal profits of the black market foreign exchange. In the future, please ask the government to clearly define the boundaries and give the industrial sector the right to allocate quotas. The Industrial Association and the Industrial Trade Association will send more than a dozen representatives to Beijing this Wednesday to state their opinions. The Mechanical Industry Association, the Production Promotion Association, the National Goods Factory Federation, and the National Goods Production and Sales Association will also go to Beijing on the same day to state the opinions of the national goods merchants to the central authorities for opening up trade with Japan. The Industrial Association resolved to make six suggestions to the government:

(1) The Export Control Commission should announce in detail to which family the first phase of quotas was allocated and the amount of the quotas.

(2) For the second quarter's quota allocation rate, please ask the quota allocation office to first allocate the amount of raw materials that industry and commerce should import, and the Industrial Association will be responsible for negotiating the allocation. The allocation results should be reported to the quota allocation office for processing. Before the agreement is reached, no visas should be issued.

(3) Starting from the third quarter, the raw materials required by each factory should be requested by the quota allocation office to specify their types and values ​​and directly give them quota allocation rights. If the application industry is simple, it should be allocated by one industrial trade association. If the application industry is in two or more industries, it should first be handed over to the Industrial Association, which will be responsible for negotiating the allocation and reporting the allocation to the quota allocation office for approval.

(4) The factories in other cities should be handed over to the local industrial associations for allocation.

(5) When the raw materials imported under quota are not enough for three months of application, they can handle their own foreign exchange, or the foreign exchange earned from exports of each industry can be used for their own use.

(6) Please establish a special operating agency in the short term to supply the raw materials required by each industry.

At the same time, the Shanghai Industrial Association and all industrial trade associations in Shanghai also issued a declaration on the handling of raw materials imported under quota.

### Industrial Workers are Repaid with Rapeseed Oil

This year, the rape seeds in Jiangnan are expected to have a bumper harvest. The various producing areas have already been listed on the market one after another. Experts in the industry estimate that the output will be more than 200,000 dan. Due to the recent authorities' implementation of the oil allocation work for industrial workers, soybeans are expensive, so rapeseed oil is used for allocation and sale. The China Trust Bureau, together with the oil pressing industry, is conducting purchases. It has now obtained a loan of 15 billion yuan and has successively purchased more than 60,000 dan of rapeseed. Half of it has been transported to Shanghai and handed over to various factories for oil pressing. The cost of each dan of rapeseed oil is as high as 880,000 yuan, but the oil allocation for industrial workers is still set at 4,500 yuan per catty. The oil pressing contract has been signed recently, stipulating that the China Trust Bureau will use 42 catties of rapeseed cake from each factory for each dan of rapeseed as oil pressing fees.

At present, the price of rapeseed oil in the market is lower than the cost of oil pressing by the China Trust Bureau, which is said to be caused by the following reasons: various oil pressing factories or vendors are familiar with the local purchase situation and absorb it at a low price. Commercial institutions are more efficient than government agencies. Manufacturers sell at a discount due to borrowing money. And in important producing areas such as Chongqing, the price of new products on the market has fallen a lot, which has affected the Tai city.

### Hot Water Bottle Factories Urge Self-Sufficiency in Foreign Exchange

Since the implementation of foreign exchange controls, the production of hot water bottle factories in this city has stagnated. The sale of hot water bottles produced by these factories to Hong Kong, the South Sea Islands, and other places accounts for 60% of their total production, with an estimated monthly export volume of over 20 billion. The current market price for a two-pound hot water bottle is 490,000 national currency per dozen. In Hong Kong, the selling price is over 70 Hong Kong dollars. Based on the black market exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars, exporters can still make a profit. However, if the government purchases foreign exchange at the official rate, the price of these goods would need to be 200 Hong Kong dollars upon arrival in Hong Kong, making them unsalable. As a result, exporters are hesitant, and manufacturers are suffering significant losses. All hot water bottle businesses in this city have appealed to relevant government agencies for assistance, requesting the opening of the Southeast Asian market and permission for self-sufficiency in foreign exchange. Despite multiple days passing, no official response has been received from the government. With the proposed opening of trade with Japan about to be implemented, our country's only market in Southeast Asia is in imminent danger. Therefore, hot water bottle businesses are preparing to make further appeals, hoping that the government will maintain the existing Southeast Asian market, comply with popular sentiment, and immediately liberalize foreign exchange.

### Jiangsu Farmers Hold Business Symposium

The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank operates agricultural loans, agricultural warehouses, and other businesses to serve the local area. It has 62 branches and offices throughout the province. To strengthen its operations, the head office convened a business symposium yesterday afternoon in Zhenjiang, bringing together responsible representatives from various branches and offices with heavy workloads throughout the province. Attendees included Liu Shixiu from Shanghai, Cao Tang from Suzhou, Jiang Jingzhai and Wang Liangfeng from Wuxi, Xie Zhaonan from Changzhou, Wei Jiaji from Zhenjiang, Lin Liming from Nanjing, Wang Jiansheng from Changshu, Cui Jiezhen from Xuzhou, She Wenbo from Yangzhou, Chen Xiaoci from Nantong, Liu Rentao from Taixian, Ji Kezong from Taixing, Li Xinlin from Xinghua, and senior officials from the head office. General Manager Dong Zhe chaired the meeting, outlining the principles to be emphasized in future operations and listening to reports from each branch and office. On the morning of the second day, representatives invited senior officials from the head office to a tea party at Riverside Park, exchanging opinions in an informal conversation. Starting at 10:00 AM, the meeting continued at the head office to discuss various proposals.

### After Factory Price Adjustment, "Guben" Soap Prices Soar

Yesterday, the market for daily necessities also showed strength. The factory price for "Guben" soap was raised to 460,000, causing excitement in the market, with significant buying activity. Sporadic replenishments were also strong, and the asking price rose step by step from 475,000. The closing price at noon rose to 483,000, a sharp increase of 10,000 compared to the previous day. For "Arrow Knife" soap, the price for those holding warehouse receipts was 480,000, but the market price yesterday was only 475,000. Although it rose by 5,000, it still resulted in a loss of interest. Sales of other soaps, such as "Guanghua," "Niu Pai," and "Riyue," were also good, with increases ranging from 1,000 to 5,000, but "Huang Xiangmao" saw a flat result.

The match market saw increased activity. "Meili" brand increased by 40,000 per box, to 3,160,000, and "Fenghuang" brand also rose by 10,000, to 3,110,000. Other brands, such as "Laohu," "Nanjing," and "Ningbo," also saw significant price increases due to strong customer demand.

The kerosene market remained firm. "Gaodu" barrel goods traded at 830,000 to 840,000. American half-pint cans were priced at 127,000 to 128,000, while Asian companies quoted 121,000 to 126,000.

The candle market remained strong due to high raw material costs. "Baili" brand rose to 500,000 per box, "Sengmao" to 550,000, and "Ji Pai" to 400,000. However, trading was mediocre due to the hot weather.

### Cigarette Market Sentiment Firm and Buoyant

Yesterday, the cigarette market saw that the delivery of goods from Yong Tai He was not yet complete, and demand from other businesses remained strong. Retail outlets were active, frequently replenishing their stocks. The market still lacked sufficient supply, and trading sentiment was strong. The market trended upward in a winding manner, becoming even stronger at noon. "Ten-Stick British" cigarettes rose to 9,470,000, with buyers stepping in, resulting in a rebound of 130,000 compared to the previous day. "Laodao" cigarettes also rose to 7,430,000, with transactions occurring, showing an increase of 100,000 compared to the previous day.

"Wuhua Hademen" cigarettes maintained good momentum, and prices were also firm. Other cigarettes from Chinese manufacturers showed mixed results, fluctuating between 300 and 500. However, "Jinshu Pai" cigarettes saw a significant price drop, falling by 700 per pack, due to rumors that Huacheng Company would be arranging for delivery of goods soon. American cigarettes, such as "Six-Pack Camel" and "Malis" cigarettes, and 50-stick canned cigarettes, such as "Qialike," "Sanwu," and "Shuishou," saw weakening market trends due to sluggish sales.

### Overview of the Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang

Detailed Report Released by the Farmers Bank

[Central News Agency, this city] Regarding the general situation of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, loan comparisons, and increased production, the Chinese Farmers Bank released detailed information as follows:

This spring, approximately 1.5 million sheets of silkworm eggs were distributed, including local varieties. With an average of two sheets of silkworm eggs raised per household, there were approximately 750,000 silkworm farmers, producing a total of approximately 280,000 dan of fresh cocoons. Among them, more than 70,000 could be reeled into more than 200,000 dan of local silk. The bank has provided loans for manufacturers to reel the silk, which will be handed over to the Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee for export. Calculated at 1.2 million per dan of fresh cocoons, the total value is approximately 336 billion. In other words, each silkworm farming household can earn an average income of 448,000 within one month. This is beneficial for guiding idle funds into the right track and revitalizing the rural economy. Considering that the silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang accounts for half of the total national output and suffered severe damage during the anti-Japanese war, the bank intends to revive and increase production after the victory by providing loans for the silkworm and mulberry industry. The following are some of the achievements:

(1) Mulberry Seedling Loans: In 1946, 36 cooperative societies in Haining, Chongde, Tongxiang, and Hangxian counties of Zhejiang Province, including 2,711 member households, increased planting by 2,506.08 mu, with loans totaling 62,341,750. This year, continued loans for transplanting and grafting mulberry seedlings amounted to 318,417,250, resulting in 2 million grafted seedlings and 125 million one-year-old seedlings, sufficient to supply one-fourth of the materials needed for the restoration of mulberry gardens in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

(2) Seed Production Loans: In the spring of 1946, 946,000,000 was lent to 45 seed production farms in Zhejiang Province and 104 seed production farms in Jiangsu Province. This year, after review by the relevant authorities, slightly eliminating some, 97 farms in Jiangsu and 41 in Zhejiang were qualified, with loans totaling 6,380,000,000. This will enable the production of more than one million improved silkworm egg sheets, which will be promoted to silkworm farmers at reasonable prices. In particular, the increase in new varieties is significant, and it is expected that the use of improved silkworm eggs will reach more than 59% next spring.

(3) Silkworm Raising Loans: There are 254 cooperative societies in Zhejiang, including 20,663 households, and 108 societies in Jiangsu, including 23,197 households, with total loans of 565,000,000. 200,000 sheets of silkworm eggs were raised. This year, there are 533 societies in Zhejiang, with 59,699 households, and 165 societies in Jiangsu, with 4,526 households, with loans totaling 5,381,000,000. 320,000 sheets of silkworm eggs were raised. In addition, the number of organizations and participating households has increased, accounting for about 14% of all silkworm farmers.

(4) Cooperative Dried Cocoon Loans: Last year, 1,129 dan were from Zhejiang Province and 1,545 dan from Jiangsu Province, with loans of 1,443,000,000. This year, 2,705 were from Zhejiang and 3,230 dan from Jiangsu, with loans of 21,981,000,000. The quantity has clearly doubled.

(5) Fresh Cocoon Purchase Loans: Last year, the Spring Silkworm Syndicate lent a total of 16.9 billion to 54 manufacturers, purchasing 143,782 market dan of cocoons. Subsequently, the bank provided loans of 10.5 billion to 47 manufacturers for autumn cocoons, purchasing 35,292 market dan of autumn cocoons, and 4,956 dan of spring dried cocoons. This spring, loans of 235.4 billion were lent to 70 manufacturers, purchasing more than 200,000 dan of spring cocoons. Last year, the government purchased only 6,472 customs dan of raw silk, and this year it is expected to purchase 14,000 customs dan.

(6) Exported Local Silk Mortgage Loans: In the Gan Jing (i.e., exported local silk) silk area, as it gradually transforms into a cocoon area, temporary mortgage loans of 1.5 billion were provided. Currently, 6,322 vehicles of raw silk have been mortgaged, reducing the local interest rate from 34 to 20, alleviating the burden of high-interest loans on silkworm farmers.

(7) New-Style Reeling Machine Loans: Last year, a loan of 150 million was provided to the Hu Xu Women's Silk School, resulting in the completion of 120 new-style reeling machines for a silk reeling factory, which are now in operation. Approximately 140 dan of raw silk are reeled on behalf of five cooperative societies in Wujiang and other areas of Suzhou, to be provided for government purchase.

### UNRRA Transports Chinese Cotton; 100,000 More Bales to Arrive

[Our Report] The total amount of cotton transported to China by UNRRA this year has reached 200,000 bales. Of these, 132,452 bales have arrived at the port. The total amount that has been allocated and sold to textile mills by UNRRA is 61,484 bales, leaving a remaining balance of 70,968 bales. About 40,000 bales have been contracted for sale with the Six Districts Cotton Spinning Association and will be delivered in the near future. UNRRA plans to sell approximately 100,000 bales to textile mills within the year. These will be shipped from the United States to China in the near future. The American cotton that UNRRA plans to sell to the 31 member textile mills of the Six Districts Cotton Spinning Association will be exchanged for 34,837 pieces of cotton yarn, each weighing 400 pounds, to be delivered in four installments. UNRRA is currently discussing with the Joint Relief Agency the issue of the future sale of this batch of cotton yarn.

### Grain Merchant Groups Appeal for Exemption from Business Tax on the Grain Industry

The exemption period for the business tax on the grain industry for various grain merchant groups in this city is about to expire. Representatives were previously sent to Nanjing, together with the joint association of chambers of commerce from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, and representatives from grain merchant groups in Nanjing and Hangzhou, to petition the central government for continued exemption. Many days have passed, but no clear written order has been received from the central government. The Rice Commercial Association, Miscellaneous Grain Commercial Association, and Flour Bran Commercial Association, three trade associations of grain merchants in this city, jointly sent a telegram yesterday to Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, appealing for them to urge the central government to issue an order for continued exemption as soon as possible, to appease their hopes.

### Focus on Developing Agriculture: Highlights of the Economic Reform Plan

Interview with Mr. Lou Tongsun by Our Newspaper's Reporter

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] After the "Economic Reform Plan" was passed by the State Council, our reporter interviewed Mr. Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, to inquire about his views on the plan. As a member of the Central Committee, he contributed many opinions during the Third Plenary Session's discussion of the "Economic Reform Plan." He also participated throughout the National Economic Commission's discussion of the plan, making him most familiar with it.

Mr. Lou attached great importance to this plan, comparing it to our country's "Economic Magna Carta." He stated that our country produced two major charters this year: the "Constitution of the Republic of China," promulgated on New Year's Day, and the "Economic Charter," passed by the State Council on August 1. The latter is based in principle on Section 3 of Chapter 13 of the former, "National Economy." Therefore, it focuses on the national economy in every aspect, paying particular attention to farmers and agriculture. Article 146 of the Constitution stipulates that "The State should use scientific technology... to promote the industrialization of agriculture," and the preamble of the plan also states, "How to make an agricultural country trend towards industrialization is the most important task for national construction in the future." This shows that the latter is truly an embodiment of the former.

Agriculture-Based Plan

The Economic Reform Plan attaches such importance to farmers and agriculture that it can also be called the "Agriculture-Based Plan." Mr. Lou pointed out that in terms of economic nature and environment, China is truly an agricultural economy country. The lifestyle and ideology of the Chinese people have not yet completely broken away from this category. Therefore, the most important significance of this plan is to restore the rightful position of the vast number of farmers and rural areas, and to seek a way out for them. This is not only detailed in the "Agriculture" chapter, but the "Industry" chapter also stipulates that "China's economy is based on agriculture. Therefore, without a self-sufficient people's industry to protect agriculture and enable the exchange of agricultural and industrial economy, the foundation of China's economy cannot be established." The first article of that chapter stipulates that "Industry should first adapt to the needs of rural areas." The preamble also mentions that future policies should start from utilizing the capabilities of the majority of the people, so that the production capacity and total income of hundreds of millions of people can support the entire country's finances. All of this illustrates that the Economic Reform Plan focuses on the agricultural economy, aiming to modernize China's agriculture and then promote industrial modernization.

Importance of County Banks

County banks bear the heaviest responsibility in developing the rural economy. Mr. Lou pointed out that the county banks referred to in the Economic Reform Plan are not the county banks stipulated in the current Banking Law, but the county banks after thorough reconstruction in the future. Separate laws will be enacted in the future to specify them in detail.

The main business of county banks is to "develop the rural economy, facilitate local construction, and cooperate with the implementation of local autonomy." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will stated that counties should be politically and economically autonomous. Political autonomy means achieving a truly democratic foundation, while economic autonomy means seeking self-sufficiency in the economy. If all counties in the country can become "autonomous bodies" politically and economically, then all counties will become what Mr. Sun Yat-sen called "the cornerstone of national construction." If a country has thousands of cornerstones, it will not be difficult to achieve prosperity and happiness. This is the guiding principle of this chapter.

According to the plan, the establishment of county banks should be based on the principle of one bank per county. However, it does not stipulate that all counties must establish banks simultaneously, but rather depends on local needs, economic conditions, and the degree of autonomy implementation. Since county banks mainly cooperate with local autonomy, they are essentially a type of "autonomous bank," in opposition to national banks, just as the financial revenue and expenditure system is divided into national finance and local finance. The plan stipulates that county banks should be invested in by the Central Bank and provincial banks as initiating shares and stipulates that "County banks should be assisted by the China Farmers Bank, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China, depending on their business categories and needs." This provision is due to the fact that China has too many counties, and the business of county banks may not easily develop in the early stages. Therefore, a parent bank is needed to support them. However, the central meaning of the plan is currently focused on agriculture, and Mr. Lou believes that it is best to use the branches of the China Farmers Bank in various places as the superior banks of the county banks.

Some people believe that after each county establishes a county bank, the state will be unable to bear the burden, and the currency will inflate accordingly. Mr. Lou does not think so, pointing out that modern banks have evolved in nature compared to past banks. Today's banks, in terms of their business, are not only limited to gathering capital, establishing credit, investing in production and profit-making businesses, and absorbing deposits, etc., but have evolved to a new stage, where their main function is "clearing." Under this new concept, only county banks are true financial entities, similar to how autonomous counties are entities in the political hierarchy. Therefore, the fact that county banks have the China Farmers Bank, etc., as their superior banks is the same as having a provincial level in politics. Both are "virtual settings," and their role is to connect them.

When the National Economic Commission discussed this issue, some members emphasized the importance of the province, believing that the province is a real autonomous province and emphasizing the importance of provincial banks. This opinion has a considerable basis in the Constitution, and Mr. Lou also expressed considerable agreement with it. However, he believes that the current political system in China, the administrative hierarchy, and the differentiation of administrative regions will be greatly adjusted after the country is stable. Therefore, the economic problems of county banks (which are permanent problems) cannot be compared with the current provincial system (which is not absolutely certain). By extension, the arguments for emphasizing the position of provincial banks are also insufficient. Although the plan still has provisions for provincial banks, they cannot be regarded as the superior banks of county banks in the future. At the same time, the establishment of branches of provincial banks is limited to "important political and economic centers in the province" and cannot be universally established. This should be specially mentioned.

Need International Assistance

Mr. Lou continued to point out that since China is an agricultural country, to make this vast agricultural country with its large population move towards industrialization, in addition to its own efforts, it needs international mutual assistance and aid to achieve industrialization as soon as possible. The plan has repeatedly mentioned this point. The preamble clarifies: "Welcome foreign capital and technical talents with preferential terms to achieve the goal of industrialization." Article 13 of the Industry Chapter stipulates: "To promote the development of industry, the government should clearly stipulate measures to encourage foreign investment and technical cooperation." Article 5 of the Chapter on Increasing Production and Stabilizing Prices also stipulates: "The government should negotiate loans for machinery and raw materials from foreign countries on preferential terms to increase the supply of materials." Mr. Lou emphasized that China's economic progress is very important for world peace. Because if China's economy is not industrialized, it will not be able to completely break away from international economic aggression and will continue to be the object of international commercial competition. This situation is enough to cause unrest in the world. It is hoped that the international community, especially the United States, can sympathize with, consider, and thoroughly recognize this point. (Note: Our government has always welcomed foreign investment in China. The Executive Yuan sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart on July 30, stating that we do not discriminate against foreign businesses and welcome American businesses to invest in state-owned and private industries.)

Some foreigners criticize our government for not using private deposits abroad. Mr. Lou believes that the Economic Reform Plan has detailed provisions for the use of private deposits abroad and cannot say that the government will not use such deposits forever. He pointed out that Article 9 of the Industry Chapter of the Plan stipulates: "The government should organize and promote the establishment of investment companies for various industrial and mining construction projects, invest long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects, and use overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange assets deposited abroad to invest in this organization to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad." Article 6 of the Chapter on Finance and Stabilizing the Currency Value also stipulates: "Citizens' assets abroad should be reported within a limited time and used appropriately."

When the National Economic Commission discussed this issue, some people outside believed that this was not easy to do. Because British and American laws do not allow the names of depositors to be disclosed to others. Mr. Lou believes that the reason why the current plan still stipulates this is similar to "wanted on file" in criminal law. The purpose is to alert the adults and gentlemen who have private deposits overseas and at least achieve a moral purpose. In fact, the government may not be able to take other effective steps in the future.

Linked Import and Export Measures

Article 3 of the Commercial Chapter of the Plan stipulates: "Export business should be actively encouraged. The government can purchase materials to facilitate exports, or designate certain items to implement linked import and export measures to increase exports to offset imports." This is the linked import and export measure that is most criticized by all parties. This measure evolved from the "linked import and export measure." After the Shanghai side proposed the linked import and export measure, the former Economic Policy Committee discussed it several times and had heated debates. The competent authorities strongly opposed it. Mr. Lou was also one of the participants in the discussion at the time and argued with reason. He believed that the implementation of linked import and export would definitely stimulate exports and then stimulate production, which would greatly help the prosperity of agriculture. The representatives of the Central Bank, etc., at the time also had to admit this. The current linked import and export measure is only a kind of vertical linkage, and its linkage is limited to the linkage of several types of "main industries," such as yarn and silk cotton. After shipping yarn and cloth for export, cotton is purchased with the foreign exchange earned itself. This is very different from the previously proposed linked import and export measure. Mr. Lou believes that it is regrettable that the plan failed to include the linked measure.

Start with Hard Work in Production

The conclusion of the plan quoted Confucius's saying: "When those who produce are many, and those who eat are few; when those who do work are quick, and those who use things are slow, then wealth will always be sufficient." Mr. Lou said that if the above words are expressed in modern terms, it means that everyone should work more and produce more. China's economy is so backward and has been destroyed for a long time. People should tighten their belts, work hard, and do practical work. All kinds of behaviors that are contrary to this cannot be called economic reform. Article 14 of the Industry Chapter of the Plan stipulates: "Wages should be reasonable to seek the stability of production order, so that labor and management can work together to increase production." This provision clearly shows the following points: first, current wages are not reasonable; second, the order of production has not yet stabilized. Labor-management cooperation and increased production can be discussed only after wages are reasonable and the order of production is stable. Mr. Lou solemnly pointed out that due to the special economic structure of China, a phenomenon of urban exploitation of rural areas has been formed, resulting in better treatment for producers and workers than for farmers. During this mobilization period, it is hoped that the labor comrades can deeply understand the meaning, work more, and produce more. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that "coordination of social and economic interests," and the intention of Article 14 is also the same.

Conclusion

Mr. Lou's conclusion on the Economic Reform Plan is: The plan itself is divided into three main parts: "Production and Construction" is the center of this plan, which is a dynamic plan and needs to be initiated through multi-faceted efforts. "Financial System" is a static plan. Once decided, it must be implemented for a period of time. "Finance" is the link between finance and production, and it is closely related to detailed machinery. After its adjustment, production can be more developed, and finance can also fulfill its functions. The plan says: "Production business cannot be without the nourishment of finance for a day, and financial revenue cannot be without the support of production business for a day. Financial policy, economic policy and fiscal policy are mutually causal, complementary and indispensable," which is what it means.

From a formal point of view, the amended plan is more concise than the original plan, but in essence, it is not without discrepancies with the original intention. As for the future implementation steps, it still needs to be studied and stipulated in detail, which is similar to the situation after the promulgation of the Constitution and the need to formulate ten constitutional regulations.

(2) Letters to this column are limited to questions from various postal departments that are related to the public. (3) Please indicate "Postal Affairs" in the upper left corner of the envelope to avoid postage. (4) Letters should be sent to the Public Service Team of the Shanghai Postal Administration or forwarded through the "Social Service" section of this newspaper.

This bureau has received inquiries from (1) Mr. Wang Zhixiao of Dasheng Hardware Store, (2) Mr. Huang Zuxian of East Sports Association Road, (3) Mr. Kong Changsheng of North Henan Road, (4) Mr. Wang Yiming of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, (5) Mr. Gu Jikang of the Hangzhou Xiyuan Cafe, (6) Mr. Jiang Yan of Xinchang Road, and (7) Mr. Xiao Huizhong of South Zhejiang Road. Specific answers to the points raised are as follows:

(Answer) (1) A. First fill out the parcel detail form, hand the parcel to the customs stationed at the bureau for inspection, then weigh it and pay the fee, and the post office will issue a receipt as proof. B. Parcels sent to Changde are sent via Hankou and Changsha. Between Shanghai and Hankou, they are transported by Yangtze River ships, which takes about six to eight days. Between Hankou and Changsha, they are transported by the Yuehan Railway, which takes about two to three days. From Changsha to Changde, they are transported by small boats, which takes about five to eight days. C. The cost of sending a parcel to Changde is 6,800 yuan per kilogram.

(2) A. If a postal item sent to Hanjiang, Fujian, can match the Shanghai-Fuzhou flight schedule, it will arrive in about three to four days. Express mail is faster than ordinary mail, and airmail is also faster, but the degree of speed depends on local conditions and cannot be generalized. B. During periods when flights are suspended, mail to Fuzhou is transported by ship, and sometimes the arrival speed is calculated by shipping to Xiamen for transfer. However, the line has resumed flights. C. Shanghai-Fuzhou flights operate every Monday, Thursday, and Friday, while Fuzhou-Shanghai flights operate every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

(7) The postal kiosk in front of the Golden Grand Theater you mentioned is only a few steps away from the Eight Immortals Bridge branch, so there seems to be no need to add another one. The suggestion to move it to the front of the Huangpu Branch is well-intentioned. However, this bureau's Eight Immortals Bridge branch is small, and the surrounding residents are concentrated, making it extremely crowded. The public often sends letters requesting improvements. This bureau once planned to add another floor to the building, but it did not happen due to some reason. Establishing a postal kiosk nearby is to reduce the congestion in that branch.

Spring and Autumn

### Clipped Prose

— Yu Yi

Preface to My "Maple Leaf Collection"

Tonight, there are no stars adorning the blue sky; the twilight is sadly weeping. Is it the night wind swirling fallen leaves in moans? … Again, I am accompanied by paste and scissors under the lamp, filled with sorrow and longing, as the long night rushes toward dawn in the ticking of the clock.

"Only a true life can reveal the true meaning of life." Li Baifeng's realistic nightmare makes me clench my fist, and the blood flows hotly. I think: "Looking through the records of the lives of the majority of people should also be a way to understand the true meaning of the lives of people in this era." Therefore, my clippings chose prose. These are difficult and tearful times, with countless people sinking and floating in seas of tears and oceans of blood; but their records have the significance of autumn red leaves struggling against the west wind. Therefore, my clippings collection is titled "Maple Leaf."

Prose is the most filled with sincere emotions. Lyric prose makes me know longing; descriptive prose makes me contemplate; and prose full of the radiance of life makes me want to sing loudly on the mountain top when the morning sun rises.

The works in "Maple Leaf Collection" are all my favorites; Ye Dingluo's "Random Memories of Tong Window" and Hong Weifa's "Yangzhou Continued Dream" both make me love them so much that I can't bear to let them go because their words are filled with either the northern mood of "when the yellow wind blows, the wind swirls the sand, covering the sky, filling the streets, and white, colorless people struggle in the sand..." or the beauty of "billions of cherry blossoms blooming, becoming a pink mist..." and "Yellow River" and "Waves of Gulangyu" give people a sense of being there. Hong Weifa's "Guanyin Temple Fair" and "Guangling Flower Society"... give people a faint bitter taste, like drinking a cup of strong black tea.

In addition to these few continuous ones, the prose with one or two-character titles in the "Spring and Autumn" column of Shen Bao is also my favorite. Like "Window", "Palace Lantern", "Candlelight", "Sail", "Dove Bell"... youthful and active, they can truly serve as models for junior high school composition.

The editor of "Spring and Autumn" is Mr. Wang Jinshan, and he is probably a person who loves truth, goodness, and beauty, so the prose in "Spring and Autumn" has a characteristic: the goodness of the subject matter, the truth of the author's emotions, and the beauty of the words. Like many bright little red flowers scattered in valleys and plains.

Ta Kung Pao's "Literature and Art" also has a lot of prose, but the temperament of these prose has become more tough. Like wild sunflowers, an unyielding heart faces the sun in the midst of storms. Like Jiang Yuan's "Oath", "Our Dream White Skeletons", and other authors' "Small Harbor", "City", "Outside the Window"... and similarly, the now-defunct United Evening News's "Evening Gleanings" and Wenhui Bao's "Pen Society" also have a lot of prose, each with its own unique style. Looking at the prose clipped from these supplements today, I can't help but silently say, "I can't forget..." "Laughter and Tears", "Fire", "Who Exactly Deceived You"...

I know several of the authors in "Maple Leaf", but the torrent of time has scattered us so that we are no longer familiar. Sometimes we can still meet, but other times we can only face these articles alone in the quiet night, using the green lamp to bless them, to bless these people who are trekking through the desolate mountains and remote fields of this troubled land with health!

I clipped newspapers strewn all over the floor, and I don't know how many cold and dark nights I spent; I actually accumulated more than two hundred articles that I liked. During the day, when the songs of wild geese are loud, I browse through them, and often I read them in the season when swallows return from the south. Therefore, I am familiar with many unfamiliar writers, their names, and personalities, as if they were old friends.

Do you also like to clip some of your favorite works? I recommend you—prose is the most emotional thing!

Note: This manuscript has been received for a long time, and whether to publish it has always been under consideration. The reason for not publishing it is very simple because the content talks about this publication, which inevitably has the suspicion of self-promotion. The reason for publishing it is that it not only talks about this publication but also talks about the supplements of several other newspapers, and also lists many articles and catalogs; in addition, the author also uses personal experience to introduce readers to a method of reading supplements and clipping newspapers. Therefore, I feel that this article can not only give many contributors to various newspaper supplements some , but also give readers who love to read supplements a methodological reference. Therefore, it is published today at the beginning of the month as a reader's opinion. As for whether the editors of this publication "love truth, goodness, and beauty" and other issues, it is just like saying whether Su Shi has "a bellyful of untimely things", and it seems unnecessary to pay too much attention in this hot weather.

### A Midsummer Night's Dream

— Li Zhi

Part One

At these times, I always feel the agitation of day, so I love the tranquility of midnight.

In the midnight, I can't hear dogs barking, I can't hear the sounds of soldiers, and only when everything is asleep and I alone am awake is this realm the most lovely. Unlike the expanse of day, at this time, the night turns the surroundings into rivers and then into the sea, seeming to be boundlessly without shore. Nothing obstructs my vision, blocking my desires, at this time everyone will be so free, so comfortable, feeling that between heaven and earth, I am a glorious and delightful existence.

People are always fond of dreaming, but when you are alone and awake at midnight, isn't it a deep night realm, where you can put aside the faces you don't want to see, where you can stay away from the daily struggles of firewood and rice, and create in your own world? Unleash as much talent as you have, unfolding the future in the dimming light, trimming a flower, managing a desire, and the most clumsy of simpletons will become a talented expert when they are awake alone.

Originally, people's talents are the same, but people's misfortunes cause them to have different environments and different encounters, so some people can't straighten their backs, and some people bend over, which is a tragic tragedy. But on this fine night, unload the burden of reality, and let yourself fly in the free world, in the dream world, although you can't help each other in times of need, adding two wings, it is still good to be able to find a moment of peace and let your soul flap its wings and soar for a while.

Now I like midnight, especially in this midsummer, without steep , without worrying about , and perhaps a gentle breeze will blow, and I will feel a sense of refreshing joy. If there is still a heaven and a blessed land in this world, then it is the midsummer midnight.

Part Two

When I am near this lonely riverside, I don't want to imagine the hustle and bustle and the disputes that were here a few hours ago. I also try my best to avoid an imagination that someone once bid farewell to the world here with his ideals and despair, like Qu Yuan three thousand years ago.

Time passes like this, never ceasing day and night, and the river's flow is just like the torrent of history, going only forward and never returning, the same way thousands of years ago and the same way thousands of years later, murmuring and whispering away. The night gives it more energy and more words, but what can I say to it?

Tonight the breeze is gentle and the stars are all over the sky. Everyone should be looking for their own dreams. They may be crying, they may be laughing. And am I not enough to appreciate this ? Taking such a summer night as a dream, I have become the master of this dream.

There is nothing more vivid than such a midsummer night's dream. The river flows under my feet, the lights remain in the heart of the river, and the sky is full of shining stars. I feel that my feet are stronger and my wisdom is brighter. I really want to go into the water to search for the stars in the reflection. Aren't they the best jewels and the brightest eyes? If this is wealth, then there is no wealth more precious than this!

Now, I want to walk into the distance of the night. What is there in the distance of the night? Is it possible to find the end of the night, and let me wander around the edge for a week, and between dawn and the long night, can't I see the magnificent , comparing the good and bad of the two? What can be doubted? Midnight is like a blank sheet of paper, let me wander in the distance of the night and become a poet, and also become a master. Maybe I can write a chapter of immortal poetry with genius, maybe I can paint an amazing masterpiece!

In this way, like Shakespeare, let the Midsummer Night's Dream also leave a colorful shadow on this barren land.

### "The Crime Committed at the East Window" Novel

— Zi Zhen

Novel Jottings

In Ms. Feng Yuanjun's recently published "Collection of Ancient Drama Theories", it says in "Postscript to the Four Studies of Ancient Drama": "Why do playwrights sometimes also write novels, such as Jin Renjie (Note 69)." (Page 52) The note says: "Jin Renjie is the author of 'Zhou Gongdan Holds the Child and Sets Up the Court', but he also wrote novels, see Lang Ying's 'Seven Categories of Drafts'." (Page 92) But this conclusion is difficult to believe because Lang Ying's words are not reliable.

The words of Lang Ying that the author is based on are found in Volume 23 of "Seven Categories of Drafts," in the section "The Crime Committed at the East Window." The original text is as follows:

"The Yue Wumu drama, He Li , all the world assumes it is a hypothetical matter, but it is to redress Wumu's grievances. I once saw Yuan's Kong Wenqing of Pingyang had a 'Crime Committed at the East Window' Yuefu, Jin Renjie of Hangzhou had a 'Crime Committed at the East Window' novel, and Zhang Guangbi of Luling had a 'Immortal in Straw Cloak' poem. I cannot remember the Yuefu and the novel, but they are roughly similar to what is currently transmitted. Zhang's poem has a preface saying: 'Song Yacha He Li, the Grand Tutor Qin sent to the First Peak in the Southeast to hook , and a daze of people led him to the underworld, where he saw Qin confront Yue. He ordered to go back and tell his wife that the crime at the East Window had been committed. Afterwards, he abandoned his official post and learned the Tao, and his remains are now at the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, being the Immortal in Straw Cloak.' Based on this, it can be known that several people have declared that this matter exists. Otherwise, why should his descendants be Qing blind for generations, and Luo Rujie's son could not get up after bowing to the Yue Temple in Ezhou? Isn't that proof? So great and magnificent, such a major event, will there be no retribution? If the 'Yi Jian Zhi' records that He Xian has no Yacha, it is feared that it has been omitted."

Qing Chu Renhuo's "Jian Tian Ji" Volume 4 also has the same record. The original text first quotes "Yi Jian Zhi", and then says:

"The 'Jianghu Miscellaneous Records' record: After Hui killed Wumu, he prayed at Lingyin Temple. A monk garbled a verse knowing that Qin lived there. The monk wrote a poem with the line, 'The Chancellor asks me where I am going, my home is on the First Mountain in the Southeast.' Hui ordered He Li to seek it. Li came to a palace and saw a monk sitting in judgment. Li asked the attendants, who replied: 'The Bodhisattva of the Earth judges Qin Hui for killing Yue Fei.' After a while, several soldiers brought Hui in, wearing forged shackles, his face covered in dirt. Upon seeing Li, he called out: 'Tell my wife, the crime at the East Window has been committed!' 'Seven Categories of Drafts' also records: Yuan Kong Wenzhong of Pingyang had a 'Crime Committed at the East Window' Yuefu, Jin Renjie of Hangzhou had a 'Crime Committed at the East Window' novel, and Zhang Guangbi of Luling had a 'Immortal in Straw Cloak' poem. I cannot remember the Yuefu and the novel, but they are roughly similar to what is transmitted in the world. The poem has a preface saying: 'Song Yacha He Li, the Grand Tutor sent to the First Peak in the Southeast , a daze of people led him to the underworld, where he saw Hui confront Yue. He ordered to tell his wife that the crime at the East Window had been committed. After returning, he abandoned his official post and learned the Tao, and his remains are now at the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, being the Immortal in Straw Cloak.' Based on these statements, it can be known that this matter actually happened on that day, not just a hypothesis to redress Wumu's grievances."

Comparing the two, "Jian Tian Ji" clearly copied , and deliberately changed the text and mistakenly called Wenqing Wenzhong. "Jian Tian Ji" is indirect secondhand material and is therefore unreliable; even the "direct historical material" "Seven Categories of Drafts" is equally unreliable. Lang Ying was a person in the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, and Cheng also lived in the Wanli period, which was far from the Yuan Dynasty. What he said may not have strong evidence; and he himself clearly said, "I cannot remember the Yuefu and the novel." When he wrote the book, he relied on the memory of "having seen" it, and did not compare books, even not seeing the Yuan Zaju drama, and only relying on the song titles. His basis was probably Yuan Zhong Sicheng's "Record of Ghosts."

According to "Record of Ghosts," Kong Wenqing is listed on the top volume, and Jin Renjie is listed on the bottom volume. Kong Wenqing's entry says, "Person from Pingyang," and lists "Qin Taishi Commits the Crime at the East Window," and also notes, "Also said to be written by Yang Juer." The title of the old Ge Manuscript collection of Tianyige is properly named: "The Bodhisattva of the Earth Witnesses the Crime Committed at the East Window," "He Zongli as the West Mountain Pilgrim." Jin Renjie's name has a brief biography, saying that he was a person from Hangzhou, and was appointed an official of the Jiankang Chongmi Office. He died in the second year of the Tianli reign (1329). It also lists seven dramas such as "Cai Yan Returns to Court," and "Qin Taishi Commits the Crime at the East Window" (the Ming manuscript does not have the three words "Qin Taishi") is also among them. The Ming manuscript notes "Two Versions" under Kong's version, and "Second Version" under Jin's version. The Ming Zhu Quan's "Taiping Zhengyinpu" also notes "Two Versions" under each version. Those noted as "Two Versions" or "Second Version" are said to mean that the two authors each wrote a Zaju drama with the same name, which was a Yuan drama convention. Looking at it this way, Jin Renjie's "Crime Committed at the East Window" is clearly a Zaju drama, not a novel. "Record of Ghosts" has Zhong Sicheng's eulogy of Lingbo Xian for Jin Renjie, which does not say that he authored a novel. Jia Zhongming's eulogy of Kong Wenqing, attached to the Ming manuscript, says:

The gentleman was like a grandson of the sage's gate, analyzing and living in a simple leaf divided. Eager to learn and not ashamed to ask those of high ability, he is worthy of the title "Wen". He often had Dao Hongren in his writings. He twirls "The Crime Committed at the East Window," which is the old version of West Lake, clarifying good and evil and persuading the turbulent people.

It is noteworthy to note the sentence "Twirls 'The Crime Committed at the East Window'". Kong Wenqing was an early author of Yuan Zaju drama, while Jin Renjie was a mid-period figure, slightly later than Kong. Jin was a person from Hangzhou, and his Zaju drama was performed in Hangzhou, which is "the West Lake version." Kong's work was earlier, and was an old version before Jin's version, so Jia Zhongming said that the one he wrote, "is the old version of West Lake." This firm evidence proves even more that Jin Renjie's version was also a Zaju drama. The currently popular Jingyin "Thirty Yuan Drama," has a copy of "The Crime Committed at the East Window," which does not have the name of the author, but his title is the same as that of the Ming manuscript "Record of Ghosts," which is Kong Wenqing's work.

Or someone may suspect: Jin Renjie once authored a novel that was not recorded in the "Record of Ghosts." But this suspicion is also difficult to believe. "Record of Ghosts" records Zaju drama authors, and invariably attaches their other works, such as Qu Yanying's "One Hundred and Twenty Lines" and Yuan Ben of " Money Slave", Wang Bocheng's "Heavenly Facts Forgotten Palace Tune", Zhong Junxiang's "Loving Daughter Theory", Shen He's "Happy Enemies", "Eight Views of Xiaoxiang", Qian Lin's "Drunken Revelations", Wu Renqing's "Golden Thread New Sound", etc., and Lu Dianzhi's novel "Good Son Zhao Zheng Story", is also especially . If Jin Renjie had a novel, it seems unlikely that it would not be recorded. Also, if it is a novel, Zhong would not have put him in the list of dramas (whenever there are other writings, "Record of Ghosts" invariably attaches them to the mini biography.) Furthermore, if Jin Renjie had both a famous drama and a novel of the same name, it should also be noted in the mini biography to avoid confusion. In short, from the perspective of "Record of Ghosts," it can be very certain that Jin Renjie's "Crime Committed at the East Window" is a Zaju drama, and definitely not a novel. The reason for this is entirely Lang Ying's misremembering. Therefore, Qing Jiao Xun's "Drama Theory" Volume 5 said: "Kong Wenqing has the drama 'Qin Taishi Commits the Crime at the East Window,' and Jin Renjie also has it, 'but it is a pity that it is not transmitted.'" He is the most able to distinguish truth from falsehood, and is not misled by Lang Ying.

### Lightness

— Kuang Ying

A white silk shirt swung a few times on the bamboo pole and fell to the ground, so comforting and peaceful. Like a white cloud without intention, guarding the opposite peaks, without a trace of waves. I don't want to pick it up, fearing that my hands will be stained with the breath of soil, and stain it with worldliness.

A child who picked up a tree branch and returned, singing a small tune without notes, glanced at the white silk shirt on the ground and walked past it.

What a light and leisurely scene this should be!

Yesterday I walked past the stream in the village in front. Several laundry women whispered on the smooth stones by the stream, the beat of the washing club close to the clothes, and after they coldly glanced at me , even the whispers fell silent. This return has actually chased back ten years of my past, reminding me of listening to the tide on my pillow as a child. I was the darling of the sea, but now, lingering in this mountain city with its narrow boundaries, I can't even find a familiar face.

Watching snowflakes scatter on the waters and mountains, I think of the catkins flying along the shore, which could not be more light; watching the hurried comings and goings of pedestrians outside the window, I think of the swallows flying across the sky, which could not be more light. But tonight, under the lamp, a traveler far from home will not have the leisure lightness of a white silk shirt falling on the ground, let alone the whispering feelings of laundry women by the stream. Instead, I am counting the stars in the corner of the room, one, two, those countless lost stories.

The sound of distant temple bells tells me that there are still of in the human world.

### Verses Written on the Road Between Florence and Pisa by Lord Byron

— Zhen Qin's Tentative Translation

Oh, talk not to me of a name great in story;
The days of our youth are the days of our glory;
And the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty
Are worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.

What are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled?
'Tis but as a dead flower with May-dew besprinkled.
Then away with all such from the head that is hoary!
What care I for the wreaths that can only give glory?

Oh Fame!—if I e'er took delight in thy praises,
'Twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,
Than to see in the eyes of the loved one discover,
That not without worth in those eyes was your lover.

There only I've sought thee, there only I've found thee;
Her glance was the best of the rays that surround thee;
When it sparkled o'er aught that was bright in my story,
I knew it was love, and I felt it was glory.

[Note] This lyric poem was written by Byron in mid-November 1821 and first published in the author's "Letters and Diaries" in 1830. The myrtle and ivy mentioned in the first verse are symbols of youth and joy. In ancient Greek festivals, they were used to garlands, and ivy was also a plant dedicated to Bacchus, the god of wine. The victor's crown is made of laurel branches, so laurel represents honor. -- Translator

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Yaoqun then explained in detail her journey of the past ten days or so, the terrifying experiences she had, and the dangerous environment she was currently in. What follows is a memoir…

Even before the launch of the "Eighth Secret" plan, the head of the Matsu Group, Doihara, greedy for merit and jealous of talent, contacted several executive committee members of the Black Dragon Society. After obtaining the outline of the "Conquer China" military plan, Tsurumi managed to discover the content. He had long wanted to send someone to infiltrate the Matsu Group and establish a secret radio station in Shanxi to monitor the Matsu Group's actions and disrupt them when possible. However, his own manpower was too thin and he was unable to allocate it, so he hesitated. This time, after returning to Tokyo, in order to explore the "Seven Secret Seals," he learned that the Matsu Group's power had gradually expanded from Pei Bei to Wanquan, then to Datong, and then to Taiyuan. If he did not take steps to curb them, when the war eventually extended to Shanxi, they could seize the entire territory of Shanxi without lifting a finger in a short period of time.

At the same time, Doihara was also a cunning old fox. The subordinates he employed were all members of the Matsu Group, and they organized their own separate telecommunications agencies and general staff headquarters. He did not use any specially trained telecommunications personnel from the mainland headquarters. Even if someone was very capable, it was impossible to infiltrate this organization. Therefore, apart from recruiting talent to establish a branch in Shanxi, there was no other way.

With Yaoqun's knowledge and training, could she not handle the responsibility of organizing this branch on her own? Unfortunately, this organization required Japanese people or those proficient in Japanese to be able to perform the job well. She did not speak a word of Japanese, and her only assistant for the time being, Little Tiger, also did not understand Japanese, so he naturally could not help her in leading this "spy" work.

However, the situation was urgent and could not be put aside just because there were no suitable people. After seeing W, and myself carefully researching it, the situation in Peiping took a sharp turn for the worse at this time. Therefore, we decided on a compromise: we entrusted all the affairs of our Changxindian headquarters to W's headquarters for collection and safekeeping; all of our team members were transferred to Shanxi; and W, using the name of the headquarters, appointed Yaoqun to go with us to expand the work and organize a combined counter-espionage network: the work of exploring the Matsu Group's information would be handled by me and "04"; and the action aspect would be directed by Yaoqun. If there were any emergency measures beyond my ability, they would be handled by Tsurumi. If Tsurumi could spare the time, he would of course be stationed in Shanxi permanently and work with us.

When Tsurumi initially cabled from the east, instructing us to transplant to Shanxi, Yaoqun had already received the news from me and was very happy. On the one hand, she also planned to go to the old stronghold in the Northeast to find some talent to work with us. Later, when she saw Tsurumi come to Peiping, because of the failure to explore the "Secrets," he seemed dispirited and did not mention the matter, she was naturally puzzled. When she could no longer restrain herself, she brought it up to Tsurumi in person. Although Tsurumi responded vaguely, he was not as direct and straightforward as W, who readily agreed and promised to provide everything needed. As a result, Yaoqun reasonably developed a small misunderstanding.

This small misunderstanding accumulated in Yaoqun's heart. When Pingzi arrived in Peiping, and showed herself during the conflict between Tsurumi and the puppet police garrison commander, and decided to whisk Tsurumi away to Shanghai within a few hours that night, the small misunderstanding evolved into a certain feeling, a mysterious and inexplicable misunderstanding that often occurs between men and women. Only then did she truly rise up and request W to be allowed to take on the responsibility alone and go to Shanxi to work.

Scientific Weekly

### Inaugural Declaration

Now is the world of science, and we have entered the atomic age. The power of two atomic bombs hastened the end of the Second World War. This is the most significant demonstration of the effectiveness of science in history. Therefore, all new developments in politics, diplomacy, military affairs, economics, and transportation in the post-war world are directly or indirectly influenced by the power of science. For example, the secrecy of the atomic bomb has intimidated emerging ambitious nations, and the future world's security and human happiness are built upon the development of science.

The world is changing so drastically and science is progressing so rapidly. Individually, without adequate scientific knowledge and cultivation, it is difficult to keep up with this complex modernized life and one inevitably becomes a backward person, not even qualified to enjoy it. Nationally, without a solid scientific foundation and facilities, one cannot achieve independence and autonomy, let alone qualify to be among the powerful nations. Look at the post-war reconstruction efforts in various countries. Those with advanced science, such as the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and other countries, have a wealth of scientific talent and have quickly reorganized their countries in an orderly manner and rebuilt them!

Conversely, look at our country. Two years after victory, how much reconstruction work has been done? On the one hand, domestic unrest has hindered many construction projects. At the same time, it is also because our country's scientific foundation is too poor and we lack talent. Not to mention that construction work has not even begun, even the handover work has not been done well, resulting in discontinuity, low production, inflation, and an economy on the brink of collapse. It is painful to speak of! However, it is never too late to mend the fold. For the sake of building a foundation for the country and for the people to survive, we can only beg for the help of omnipotent science. Only science can save us, bringing us back from the dead, its effects are always reliable. The facts are so, there is no need to doubt. All ambitious youths and progressive citizens must enrich their scientific knowledge, intensify their scientific training, inspire scientific thinking, and become modernized citizens with scientific cultivation, to undertake the great task of national reconstruction and create a truly free, equal, prosperous, and strong democratic nation.

For the past seventy years, this newspaper has been dedicated to promoting cultural undertakings, and it has paid particular attention to the development of science. It has always been at the forefront of reporting on scientific matters, enlightening the people of the new nation, and has published several scientific columns. However, due to frequent personnel changes and a volatile world situation, it was published and then discontinued, which is regrettable! But the importance of science is growing with the times. Scientific undertakings, which had just begun to sprout, have shrunk again due to the disruption of the eight-year war of resistance, and need to be promoted even more. With this in mind, we are re-issuing "Scientific Weekly." It is edited by our own staff, with specially invited experts writing articles, and we welcome contributions from all parties. The aim is to instill scientific knowledge in the general public, to cultivate a habit of scientific study among the people, to raise the scientific level of the people through subtle influence, and to supplement the shortcomings of school education. It is intended for the general public, not for experts. The editorial content is standardized to suit the comprehension of the general reader, and the writing is preferably in-depth and easy to understand, rich in interest. It is best to use popular language to describe profound academic principles, introduce scientific ideas, explain scientific phenomena, and synthesize scientific reports. The articles should be brief, and any novel scientific theses, modern scientific trends of thought, as well as scientific news, book reviews, and other works, written in the vernacular, are welcome. We only discuss science and do not involve other matters. At the beginning of this publication, we are briefly stating our purpose, which should be considered a dedication. We hope that you will understand!

### The Concepts of Atoms and Molecules

— Zeng Shiyu

The concept of the atom, as everyone knows today, originated in Greece. The reason why the ancient Greeks engaged in this root-seeking thought about the ultimate structure of matter was because the dialectician Zeno had argued that Achilles, the swift-footed warrior in mythology, could not overtake a tortoise. The sophism and conditions set by Zeno were that Achilles, when chasing the tortoise, must first reach the place where the tortoise initially started. When he reached this point, the tortoise would have moved forward a considerable distance during this time. By the time he crossed this distance and reached the tortoise's second starting point, the tortoise would have moved forward again. Therefore, following this recursion, he would never be able to overtake this slow-moving tortoise. Sophistry and casuistry were highly regarded by the Greeks. Those who refuted Zeno's seemingly true but false argument said that the actual distance could not be infinitely divided at will. This means that if it cannot be divided to an infinitely small extent, Zeno's conclusion would not hold. Applying this kind of thinking to actual matter, can matter be infinitely divided by physical methods? If there is a final limit to the division of matter, then this is the starting point of the concept of the atom.

Among the Greek philosophers, the earliest to advocate the atomic theory was Democritus. According to him, the universe contains empty space, and besides that, there are an infinite number of atoms that are extremely small in shape and cannot be further divided. The existence of objects is entirely due to the aggregation and dispersion of groups of atoms. Although this kind of speculation is very precise, it is not supported by actual verification. It was not until the development of modern science that the theory of atoms could become truly accurate.

Democritus lived around 400 years before the Christian era. By the beginning of the 19th century, when modern chemistry was emerging, the British scholar Dalton, in order to give a systematic explanation of the laws discovered by experiments in chemistry, established his atomic theory of the structure of matter. His theory was not only clearer than what the Greeks had imagined, but he further reasoned that since atoms are indivisible and extremely small units, the combination of each atom with another type of atom must take an integer and form a simple ratio to form different substances. This means that one atom of type A must combine with one, two, three, four, or other integers of atoms of type B. If the number of atomic proportions is different, then the properties of the substances formed will be different. This inference is the most important and extremely outstanding feature of Dalton's theory. If this inference can be proven by the results of experiments and no exceptions are found, then the structure of matter is indeed as Dalton imagined, and is in fact formed by the aggregation of extremely small units of atoms. Before Dalton announced his theory, he had already discovered his law of multiple proportions. This law states that when one element combines with another element to form multiple substances, if a certain amount of the former element is taken, the amount of the latter element contained in each compound must form a simple multiple of each other. The explanation of this law can be derived from the final inference in Dalton's theory. Dalton then took methane and ethylene as examples. In these two compounds, the weights of carbon in one and the other compound formed a ratio of one to two. Later, more and more in chemistry, it is increasingly long to prove the accuracy of Dalton's theory.

The atom is the smallest unit when matter is constructed, which seems to be conceivable. However, to what extent the atom is so small that we still cannot obtain a concrete concept based on Dalton's theory. A large number of atoms aggregate to form a molecule. If we can see the volume of the molecule, and also know how many atoms of different types are in one molecule, then the volume of the atom can also be inferred from this. However, the molecule is also a tiny object. To what extent each substance is tiny before it becomes a unit molecule, this cannot be measured by ordinary methods either. Therefore, we must have a clear definition of the molecule. From this definition, we can then infer the size of the molecule. Can Avogadro's law be used as the definition of a molecule? Avogadro's law says, "At the same temperature and pressure, the number of molecules of all gases in the same volume is equal." Therefore, we can make the following provision for the concept of molecules. Taking various gases of the same volume under the same pressure and temperature, we measure, count, measure, and calculate them. If we find that each has the same numerical value, then this is the numerical value of the molecules we are seeking. All gases, in certain conditions, take a certain volume, and there must be a certain number of molecules in it. If we can find this numerical value, and also know the number of atoms in one molecule, then the atom can also become an individual that can be measured and counted. The progress of modern chemistry and the ability to refine the research on atomic structure are all due to the fact that we not only know that the atom really has its body, but also allow our measurement and counting to stop.

Scholars have concluded that atoms exist because they have investigated whether matter can be infinitely divided. Applying this idea to the study of electrical phenomena, it was discovered at the end of the nineteenth century that electric current, which has a beginning and an end and does not accumulate, is composed of electrons, which are even smaller than atoms, following each other closely. Applying this kind of thinking to the study of radiant energy, we further learned that energy also has its indivisible unit - the quantum. However, before the formal establishment of the atomic theory, Europeans in the West felt that there was no limit to the arbitrary division of time in physics and length in mathematics, which eventually led to the invention of differential calculus, which is also the most successful creation of human thought. However, all these achievements stem from our desire to study whether all phenomena in the universe can be arbitrarily and infinitely divided. There is a book in our country that says, "Take half of a one-inch pole every day, and it will never end for generations." This is similar to the problem posed by the Greek philosopher Zeno, but our country did not produce a profound fundamental concept of science because of it, nor did it have the formation of a precise atomic theory, which is something we can regard as regrettable.

### "Moonlight City"

— Wan Gongyu

Everyone believes that Austin, Texas, USA, is the only city in the world illuminated by artificial moonlight. Just like other cities use ordinary street lamps, for many years, soft blue light from mercury lamps on top of twenty-nine iron towers has illuminated the entire city. These iron towers, fourteen stories high, illuminate eight square miles of the city.

### On Mica

And Its Artificial Manufacturing Method

Mica has some value in the electrical industry, because it has certain properties that other substances cannot match. For example, muscovite mica can be easily split into extremely thin sheets, and these sheets have unexpectedly high electrical resistance to passing electricity. Mica is quite tough and elastic. A good piece of mica sheet can be rolled into seven cylinders with a diameter of one-eighth of an inch without breaking. If you heat this cylinder to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, it can still act as a good insulator under a high voltage of 12,000 volts.

Because mica is not affected by heat and electricity, mica sheets are often used to wrap the heating wires of electric ovens. However, the most important use of mica is in generators, motors, and radio tubes, because mica can be used to isolate the heating parts through which the current passes, so as to eliminate adverse effects such as short circuits and power loss.

In the spark plugs on airplanes, mica has also replaced qualifications, because the temperature and pressure generated by airplane engines are higher and greater than those of automobile engines, and the temperature changes are also more drastic.

The automobile industry is also one of the big consumers of mica. Before the war, 250 million pieces were used each year just for rectifiers that start engines and generators.

Other uses include the splendor used for decorating wallpaper and other decorations, as well as mica powder used in rubber manufacturing to prevent excessive adhesion.

Mica has only been used in Europe for three hundred years. India used it earlier. Today, the electrical industry is booming and the demand is greater, so artificial manufacturing methods have to be used to make up for the lack of natural mica.

Among the artificial mica manufacturing methods, the one invented by the Germans two months before their surrender was the most successful. The method is to first put sand, cryolite, and other raw materials in a stone crucible and heat them to melt them, and then a mixture is obtained. When this mixture is cooled from 1270 degrees Celsius to 1230 degrees Celsius, it is split into sheets like natural mica after being treated with a magnetic field. Unfortunately, after the Germans surrendered, they were unable to continue to complete the production for the market, so it has not been paid attention to.

### Total Mobilization of Soviet Geographers During Wartime

— Yan Deyi

The total mobilization of Soviet geographers during World War II, after the victory, the director of the Geographical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Grigoriev (A. A. Grigoricv), has reported. The wartime work began in June 1941, with the joint cooperation of geographical researchers of the institute and members of the Soviet Geographical Society, conducting field surveys, research, and writing, with great achievements and great merit.

The wartime work of Soviet geographers had two major missions that were most urgent. One was geographical readings for front-line combat troops. The battle lines were long, the war zones were vast, and the natural and human landscapes were intricate and complex. Soldiers were unfamiliar with the local environment everywhere. Only with on-the-spot investigation of geographical information could they have a basis for advancing and retreating and adapt to life. The second was reference materials for rear defense construction. The destruction of artillery fire, the reconstruction of factories, and the strategic reorganization and deployment must be based on the distribution of national resources and transportation to ensure that supply and demand are met and work is stable. The Soviet Union's great war against Germany was initially frustrated and then victorious. The front-line battlefield extended to Central Europe and Southeastern Europe, and rear construction developed the hinterland of the Eurasian continent. Secret reconnaissance and adventurous exploration, the Soviet geographers' important tasks in the front and rear were extremely arduous.

Serving the front-line combat troops with geographical information, the area of Soviet combat operations was greater than that of any other country. The battlefields were all over the country and abroad. The mountains, rivers, terrain, customs, and human feelings of the local area were relied on geographical readings from various places to be available at any time. Therefore, the Geographical Institute was responsible for compiling and supplying them. In the first two years, the gazetteers of Romania, Hungary, eastern Germany (natural environment), southern Germany (economy), Norway, Finland (natural environment), Turkey, Afghanistan (economy), and Xinjiang were completed one after another, all of which were based on information from the on-the-spot investigations of geographers. The comparison of land and water transportation routes and the weather changes at airfields were detailed, meticulous, accurate, and novel. The General Staff and the Military Command were able to adapt to the time and place and seize the opportunity to win. The various offensives on the Soviet battlefield were characterized by seasonality. In terms of tactics, the Soviet troops were good at using small terrain and changes in ground scenery. Soviet geographers' research on the scenery of various places was even more closely cooperated with botanists and soil scientists everywhere, so that complete reports could be made.

The greatest failure of the Soviet Union in the initial war against Germany was the destruction of the occupied areas and the forced evacuation of factories. The relocation of ordnance factories and the reconstruction of national defense industries were the responsibility of engineers and business managers, but the new site for the evacuation and establishment of the factories had to be a location with abundant raw materials and convenient transportation as the basic conditions. The Soviet Geographical Institute first designated the Kazakh Republic as its designated area. Kazakhstan was originally a vast grassland in the heart of the Eurasian continent, with an area of millions of square miles and rich resources. It was far away from any line of defense and was never threatened by enemy troops. It was the safest area for Soviet national defense. In 1942, when the Soviet Geographical Institute was working in Kazakhstan, it coordinated with the work of the Mara Mountain Resource Mobilization Committee in all aspects, and further studied the value of the entire Western Siberia, all of which were devoted to and led by the president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Komarov (VL. Komarov).

The economic mobilization of Kazakhstan was indeed a great and arduous task. The area was a large landlocked hinterland in Central Asia, closed and remote. The natural and human geography was vague. The work of the Soviet Geographical Institute started with mapping as its goal. The construction of the inland national defense relied on the increase in food and raw materials. The analysis of the possibility of agricultural development in the hinterland of Central Asia urgently required accurate estimates and predictions of changes. The northern and central parts of Kazakhstan are well-known arid areas, with only sufficient rainfall for three to five weeks each spring. The system for how to use underground spring water and how to design and construct water conservancy projects must first carefully observe the distribution system of surface runoff. The mapping of the entire topographic map was the basic work for repairing water conservancy and developing agriculture. The study of other geographical conditions was not neglected either. The fact that there are now cotton, rubber grass, and food crops in the barren hinterland of Central Asia is not accidental. (To be continued)

### Electric Eels and Radar

— Xi Yi

Among fish, many have bodies that carry electricity, such as electric catfish, electric rays, electric eels, etc., which are all very famous examples, but the one with the strongest power generation is the electric eel.

The scientific name of the electric eel is Electropliorus Electricus. It can weigh up to 30 pounds, with an average length of five feet, and the tail is particularly long, about four feet, which is the part with the strongest electricity. Its strength can electrocute people and animals, reaching a distance of thirty feet. Sixty percent of the tail is electric tissue. The tip of the tail is the cathode, and the tip of the head is the anode. Connecting the two poles can form a complete circuit, generating strong vibrations to repel enemies, protect oneself, and obtain food for survival. People who catch eels often do not understand this principle. If they grab this serpentine electric eel and use too much force, they often unintentionally encounter the electric eel's tail strike, and experience a kind of inexplicable feeling.

When swimming, electric eels can emit a kind of large, fast pulse. Like radar, it is used to probe the surrounding situation. Its method is to emit a strong 50-volt electric pulse from the electric cells at the rear end of the tail 50 times per second to probe whether there is food or enemies in the water. If the pulse reaches a small fish and there is a reaction, even if it is more than 100 feet away, the pores of the electric eel's body can receive this reaction feeling, because its head can be used as an antenna. After using radar to detect the location of the small fish, the electric eel immediately emits a strong 550-volt electricity from its abdomen, shooting directly at the target to stun or kill the small fish, and then catch it for food.

According to the research of Dr. David Nachmansohn of Columbia University, the radar pulses emitted by this electric eel are too fast to be sensed by the human nervous system, but the chemical reactions obtained from this prove that they are related to nerve activity and can establish the electrical relationship of human nerve impulses. It is said that this discovery will have special effects in treating chemical nerve diseases.

The reproductive method of electric eels is still a mystery. During the dry season, electric eels mostly swim in the upper reaches of the Amazon River, threatening the livestock and other wild animals in the river. However, when the rainy season comes and the river water rises, their whereabouts are unknown. Some scientists believe that they have retreated into the ocean, but their electrical equipment cannot be used in salt water, so this statement is obviously not credible, so it is said to be a mystery. Currently, the place in the United States that raises the most electric eels is the Bronx Zoo, which has 20 large wooden tanks placed in the basement. Each tank has many active and healthy electric eels for experimentation. According to Dr. Guo Zi of the New York Aquarium, when each electric eel is placed in a specially designed tank and made to emit electricity, it can cause 200 electric rainbow lamps to emit excessive light. There are several indicator lights in the Bronx Zoo that are powered by electric eels, which is truly a living generator. The world is so big, there are all kinds of wonders, and electric eels can be considered a miracle!
