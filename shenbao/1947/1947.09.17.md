### China Cannot Continue to Hesitate; Sun Ke Discusses Foreign Policy; China and the Soviet Union Can Return to Friendship; After Ambassador Wei's Report is Submitted, We Will Make Important Decisions

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] Vice President of the National Government Sun Ke exclusively met with a United Press reporter on the 16th and declared that after learning the results of General Wedemeyer's report to President Truman, the Chinese government will study whether it is more beneficial to unite with the United States or with the Soviet Union. If China is forced to lean towards the Soviet Union, the government and the CCP will inevitably be able to reach a peaceful settlement.

Vice President Sun stated that the Soviet Union's current policy towards China is based on fear, because once a public conflict occurs between the United States and the Soviet Union, China will stand on the side of the United States. If China does not have close ties with the United States, the Soviet Union will likely adopt a more friendly attitude towards China. Sun Ke also said that the Soviet Union wants China to become its friendly neighbor, but does not want China to ally with a strong country that could become its enemy, so China must struggle between the two powers to ensure that it can adapt itself to the most beneficial position for the present and the long term. Countries around the world do not form alliances for emotional reasons; every country considers its own national interests as its most important point. Sun Ke pointed out two ways to improve Sino-Soviet relations:

First, Moscow must restrain the CCP's armed resistance and help promote the unification of the Northeast and the CCP-occupied areas with the rest of China. Second, Dalian should be handed over to Chinese administration, and Lushun should be jointly managed in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. "If the Soviet Union can truly fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty and fully express its friendship, it will be sufficient for China to reconsider its attitude towards the Soviet Union." He explained that the main reason for the Soviet Union's past behavior towards China was its displeasure with the close relationship between China and the United States. The Soviet Union's refusal to give up Dalian and its actions in the Northeast were all expressions of its displeasure, but this was not the Soviet Union's intention to destroy our governance. Sun Ke solemnly pointed out that the policy shift is awaiting the submission of the Wedemeyer Report. This depends on the United States making its own decision. China cannot continue to hesitate; we must have a more effective policy to guide our future. We should understand the Soviet viewpoint and the Soviet fear that the United States is guiding Chinese policy. The main difference between our country and the Soviet government is that the Soviet Union has failed to comply with the terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. If the Soviet Union is not afraid that China will become an ally of the United States in the event of a public conflict, the Soviet Union may be willing to implement the treaty.

Sun admitted that the form of government that China is trying to establish is ideologically incompatible with the Soviet system. However, he said that if the Soviet Union does not interfere in China's internal affairs, we can live together in peace.

### Japanese Reparation Industrial Machinery; First Batch to be Allocated by Lottery

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] The first batch of Japanese reparations materials, consisting of industrial machinery, is scheduled to be allocated by lottery in mid-September by China, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. The machinery that the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to allocate to private factories in the first batch is currently being classified and numbered according to the machine cards that have been filled out, and statistics are being prepared to serve as the basis for proportional allocation to each unit after the lottery.

### Lin Yutang's Remarks; Comments on Ambassador Wei's Statement

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] A reporter asked Mr. Lin Yutang for his opinion on the statement made by our government regarding Wedemeyer's report. Mr. Lin said that inflation and the difficulties it has caused are also part of the price that our government has paid for the war in the past eight or nine years. The governments of the Allied countries should give more consideration to our country's difficulties and the nature and international significance of its war against the Communists. In short, it was the Americans who allowed the Communist tiger to raise its head in China. Now that the tiger has grown large, American personnel certainly have a responsibility to get rid of the tiger. The expression of opinions by the United States is actually useless; if it wants to help China, it must take action. Some American personnel have worked hard in the past four years to make China controlled by the Communist Party, so that in the next war, China will fight with the Communist countries instead of with the United States. I hope that the American people can now imagine more.

### Ambassador Wei Flies to Washington

[United Press, Honolulu, 16th] General Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly back to Washington on the afternoon of the 16th. General Wei arrived here on the morning of the 16th and held a secret meeting with army and navy officers in the Central Pacific.

### Executive Yuan Ratifies Appropriation; Emergency Relief for Refugees in Anhui Province

Temporary Relief Committee to be established to handle

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] The bandit disaster in Anhui Province is severe.

### Moscow Radio Broadcasts; Another Conflict on the Sino-Mongolian Border

[United Press, London, 16th] Moscow Radio broadcast a TASS news report last night stating that Xinjiang Chinese troops and the Mongolian People's Republic had another border conflict in the Betik Bogd-Uul area.

[Reuters, London, 16th] Moscow Radio reported from the TASS foreign capital, Ulaanbaatar, that the Mongolian Foreign Ministry listed seven instances of Chinese violations of the Mongolian border: the first on July 31 and the most recent on August 24.

### Madame Sun Yat-sen's Statement; Denies Running for National Assembly Delegate

[This City News] Madame Sun Yat-sen, Ms. Soong Ching Ling, issued a statement yesterday (the 16th), firmly denying the news report that she would participate in the November National Assembly delegate election. Madame said: "This news is completely inaccurate. I have no intention of participating in political elections or government work. In addition, the news originated from Guangzhou, but I have no representative or formal address in Guangzhou." Madame Sun is currently the chairman of the China Welfare Fund Committee and is actively engaged in this nationwide relief work.

### T.V. Soong Flies from Shanghai to Nanjing; Reports on the Donation of Assets; List of Equity in the China Development Bank is also Brought Along

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] T.V. Soong flew from Shanghai to Nanjing by plane at 11:00 AM on the 16th to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting to be held on the morning of the 17th and report on the donation of his equity in the China Development Bank. It is reported that the list of his equity has also been brought along.

[Our Correspondent] A senior employee of the China Development Bank said: The value of the shares donated by Mr. T.V. Soong cannot be accurately determined because the shares of the Huainan Road and Mine Company and the Yangtze Electric Company are not publicly traded on the stock exchange, so their market value needs to be estimated by experts who will assess the assets of each enterprise and calculate their profitability. The China Development Bank will convene a board meeting specifically for this matter, which will take place after Mr. Soong returns to Nanjing and publicly discloses his detailed donation plan. The three types of shares represent enterprises with bright prospects. The Huainan Coal Mine has now become the main supplier of coal in Central China, and its economic value is self-evident, but the equipment suffered considerable damage during the enemy-puppet period, and foreign exchange must be used to replenish it. The Hankou Electric Appliance Company also suffered losses during the war, while the Yangtze Electric Company did not suffer significant losses. The electricity business is somewhat monopolistic, and there is a shortage of electricity everywhere, so the prospects for the business are good, and the valuation of its shares is naturally higher than that of general industries.

### Zhang Lisheng Reports on Election Affairs; Remedial Measures to be Determined Separately for Elections in the Pacification Zone; Constitutional Government Promotion Association Holds Joint Meeting

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election General Office, answered various committee members' inquiries on election affairs at the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Committee meeting on the morning of the 16th, as follows: (1) The interpretation of election laws is limited to the jurisdiction of judicial organs. If election matters are found to be illegal, the election office should be held responsible. (2) In pacification zones or areas with war, such as the provinces of Northeast, North China, Northern Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan, the general election cannot be carried out in accordance with the law due to factual problems, and other measures must be formulated to remedy this. Therefore, this general election urgently hopes to be a true general election, and does not want the meaning of the general election to be diluted due to the special circumstances of a small number of regions. The Election General Office has recently reported the results of its investigation to the National Government, stating that there are more than 500 counties across the country that cannot conduct elections in accordance with current laws. The National Government has considered this and formulated measures, but they can only be implemented after the Legislative Yuan completes the legislative process and promulgates them. (3) In the party nomination method, efforts must be made to ensure that some people who have served the society for many years and made greater contributions can be elected. Some concrete suggestions should be studied on this point and submitted to the government for adoption. (4) Regarding the decision on the number of National Assembly delegates allocated to trade unions in various places, Zhang said that he could not answer and that it should be determined according to the circumstances in each place. (5) Regarding the issue of illiterate people writing ballots, someone asked whether the election office personnel could write on their behalf? Zhang replied that the election office has stipulated that voters can temporarily ask anyone to write on their behalf when voting. (6) Voter registration was notified to governments at all levels in early February of this year for handling. If it can be rushed immediately, it can be completed on schedule. (7) Regarding the rigid regulations on candidates in party nominations, Zhang explained that party nominations can only make party members abide by party discipline, and do not restrict others, and are not related to general elections. Furthermore, the elected candidate is determined by the votes, and the candidate should naturally be the next largest number. (8) If officials impersonate trade union members in the local area to participate in elections, voters can stop them. (9) The elections for legislators, supervisors, and National Assembly delegates can be carried out simultaneously, but the former two must be elected separately in the regional or professional groups. For example, if the National Assembly delegates are elected by regional elections, then the legislators should be elected by professional groups. Conversely, if the legislators are elected by regional elections, then the National Assembly delegates must be elected by professional groups, that is, the same scope cannot conduct elections for two different identities. As for the supervisors, they are indirectly elected and do not conflict.

[Another Dispatch] The Constitutional Government Promotion Association held its fourth joint meeting on the morning of the 16th, presided over by President Sun Ke, and passed three proposals to be submitted to the government for consideration and implementation: (1) Request the government to allocate election funds to each province, city, and county based on the actual budget to facilitate the implementation of constitutional government. (2) Request the government to issue a general order to prohibit candidates from hosting banquets in various places to prevent electoral fraud. (3) Request the government to increase the basic salaries of civil servants to achieve the practical case of adjusting treatment. The proposed measures for this case are as follows: The monthly salary for appointed positions is changed to 1,200 yuan, the salary for special appointed positions is changed to 1,000 yuan, the salary for first-level positions in the simplified appointed rank is changed to 880 yuan, the salary for first-level positions in the recommended appointed rank is changed to 540 yuan, the salary for first-level positions in the delegated appointed rank is changed to 300 yuan, and the monthly salaries of all positions in the simplified, recommended, and delegated appointed ranks, as well as employees, should be increased accordingly.

### Northeast Border Markers Have Been Moved; Central Government Orders Investigation of the Truth; Aircraft Will be Dispatched to Eastern Mongolia to Distribute Political Decrees and Announcements

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 16th] The Northeast issue has many problems, especially international incidents, which attract attention. According to recent news from relevant sources, it has been reported that the border markers on the northwestern border have been moved eastward into our territory by the Mongolian side. It is reported that an order from the central government has arrived here to conduct an investigation to clarify the situation. In addition, the relationship between Eastern Mongolia and Outer Mongolia is quite mysterious. It is rumored that Outer Mongolia has sent cadres to control the puppet Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government. Another rumor says that Outer Mongolia is urging Eastern Mongolia to seek development to avoid being resented. It is said that our responsible agency is paying close attention to the development of the Mongolian banners in the Northeast, and will soon dispatch aircraft to the north to distribute Mongolian and Chinese political decrees and announcements.

### More Than One Hundred Canadian Aircraft; Approved for Sale to Our Country

[United Press, Ottawa, 15th] A Canadian government spokesman said that the Department of External Affairs has approved the sale of 150 twin-engine Mosquito aircraft to the Chinese government by the War Assets Corporation. The British Royal Air Force used this type of aircraft for daylight bombing raids on German cities during the war. The Canadian Air Force believes that this type of aircraft is now obsolete and has recently declared 500 of them to be surplus assets, which are being sold by the government. This sale is based on the 1945 agreement stipulating that Canada will ship certain supplies to China, including aircraft. The selling price has not been announced, as the details are still being negotiated. Canada hopes to be paid in US dollars. The government spokesman stressed that this transaction is purely commercial and does not represent Canada's endorsement of Chinese policy. Canada has a policy of prohibiting the sale of military equipment to warring countries, but does not believe that the sale of these surplus aircraft violates this policy, because 150 aircraft are not enough to determine military victory or defeat. The spokesman declined to say whether this transaction will continue, but stressed that Canada does not want to engage in the arms trade.

### Communist Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Plan to Flee Southward; Defenses Along the Yangtze River Strengthened

### The Situation in the Pingjinbao Triangle Area; The War is Coming to an End; The National Army is Pursuing Southward with a Large Group of Soldiers

[Our Correspondent, Baoding, 16th] The bandits in the Pingjinbao triangle area have collapsed and retreated to the south bank of the Daqing River and continued to retreat to Renqiu. A large group of National Army soldiers is advancing south to pursue them. The National Army in Baoding marched north on the 16th to take over the defense of Xushui. The elite brigade stationed in Xu attacked eastward to encircle and suppress the bandits who invaded Zhuoxian County.

[Our Correspondent, Baoding, 6th] The person in charge of the Hebei military and political affairs told reporters today that the war in the Pingjinbao triangle area is coming to an end. Wang Li, a member of Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops, has suffered nearly half of his losses since launching an offensive on the 10th. In recent days, the National Army has taken the initiative and adopted encirclement, isolation, and ambush strategies between the Daqing River and the Xiongba Highway. The army and air force are cooperating and taking advantage of the victory to encircle and suppress the bandits. The bandits' attempt to invade the Pingjinbao triangle area has been completely defeated by the National Army. Currently, Gu'an, Yongqing, Xiongxian, Baxian, Xinzhen, and Rongcheng are all under the control of the National Army. Furthermore, the provincial government has specially allocated 1 billion yuan for demobilization expenses to accompany the army's advance and 30 million yuan for relief expenses to each county, striving for military and political unity and ensuring the connection between the three major strongholds of Pingjinbao. In addition, the Hebei bandits have launched continuous offensives against the Pingbao Line, Shimen, Laishui, and the triangle area this year, all of which have been fatally struck by the National Army. The source of soldiers urgently needs to be replenished. The National Army will eliminate the bandits wandering around in various places in one fell swoop. The bandits who are currently harassing the Pingbao Line will also be driven away. The situation in Hebei Province will have a new development in the short term.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 16th] The Communist bandits in the Pingjinbao triangle area have been broken up into smaller groups. The National Army has completely controlled the Xiongxian and Xinzhen areas. Continuing mopping-up operations are underway in the west of Wen'an.

### Impressions of General Chen Mingren

— Our Reporter Pu Dejie

The Huizhou campaign in 1925 was an important key to the National Revolutionary Army's suppression of Chen Jiongming and the consolidation of the entire Guangdong. After besieging the city, a fierce attack followed. A 22-year-old platoon leader took the lead, climbed the city wall, raised a military flag, boosted morale, and captured the bandit's nest. This platoon leader was Chen Mingren, who, 21 years later, became a two-star general whose fame shook the four corners of Sipingjie. The Huizhou campaign made Commander-in-Chief Chiang appreciate his bravery and resourcefulness, and the Battle of Sipingjie showed his determination. Twenty-two years ago, he received a gold medal. Twenty-two years later, he received a well-known reputation. What is the same is that these honors were all earned at the risk of life.

Wearing a government-issued uniform made of herringbone fabric, with a commemorative badge for President Chiang's 60th birthday celebration in the Northeast last year fastened to his right chest, and with a face tanned by the wind and dust that would not fade, he had a cluster of abnormally firm, black and dense beard. This is General Chen Mingren. He speaks with a bit of Hunan accent, and his tone is always decisive:

"Your newspaper has a Mr. Qingtao in the Northeast, right!" He said bluntly, "We've met." That's how we started talking.

Speaking of the Sipingjie Defense War, General Chen seemed less interested than usual. He smiled slightly:

"A total of forty-two days..." He didn't say much because the newspaper reports were enough, and his wind-swept complexion and firm beard gave an impression that was better than a thousand words. He said:

"The Northeast is very peaceful now. After the bandits suffered losses last time, they have not had the ability and resistance to come back and make trouble. With Chief Chen in the Northeast, everything will naturally be more stable. The day before yesterday, I saw President Chiang. He and his wife kept me for dinner and asked me in detail about the Sipingjie Defense War and the bandit situation in the Northeast recently. He also gave me three weeks of vacation so that I can go back to my hometown in Hunan. I haven't been back for ten years!"

Chen Mingren is the Communist Party's deadly enemy. In 1929, in his hometown of Liling, the Communist Party (then called "Red Bandits") killed his father. Eighteen years later, the Communist bandits in the Northeast almost took his life again. His younger brother Chen Mingxin was captured in Siping and there is still no news. Public and private feuds are combined, and he is ready to fight the Communist bandits to the end.

"If they dare to fight, let them come. We have long been replenished and prepared!"

He touched his cluster of black beard.

Draft Regulations on Reorganizing Provincial and Municipal Finances

[This Newspaper Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] After the reform of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, provincial-level finances have been restored. In order to lay the foundation for provincial and municipal finances, the Ministry of Finance is striving for self-sufficiency in order to meet the needs of provincial and municipal local autonomy. The Ministry has already included the work of reorganizing provincial and municipal finances in the work plan for the 36th year. Recently, in accordance with the original plan and the established implementation methods, it has drafted draft regulations on reorganizing provincial and municipal finances. The case has been passed by the political affairs meeting on the 16th. The entire case has seven chapters and a total of twenty-nine articles. The first chapter, General Principles, stipulates that the reorganization of provincial and municipal finances will be implemented from October 1st of this year to the end of September next year, unless the reorganization period is extended or changed with the approval of the Executive Yuan due to special circumstances or factual difficulties. Each province and city should also draft detailed implementation regulations based on the actual situation, submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and send them to the Ministry of Finance for record. The reorganization work will be led by the Finance Department and bureaus, in conjunction with relevant agencies. The results will be listed as performance. The Ministry of Finance may send personnel to guide the provinces and cities during the work process. The reorganization results should be compiled into a report and submitted to the Executive Yuan and sent to the Ministry of Finance within three months after completion. The second chapter is on reorganization procedures, the third chapter is on clearing public funds and properties, the fourth chapter is on clearing public enterprise income, the fifth chapter is on clearing creditor's rights and debts, and the sixth chapter is on adjusting revenue and expenditure, stipulating that the principle of self-balancing should be the basis of revenue and expenditure of each province and city. If the situation renders it impossible to balance, then (1) all unnecessary affairs should be stopped, (2) all unnecessary agencies and redundant personnel should be abolished, and (3) the central government should be requested to approve subsidies. The seventh chapter, Supplementary Provisions, stipulates that the increased revenue of each province and city due to the reorganization of finances, except for those that should be included in the special fund deposit, should be listed in the total revenue deposit. The various temporary expenses incurred due to the reorganization of finances may be budgeted and paid from the second reserve fund item of the province and city.

Measures for Handling the Use of Enemy and Puppet Property

[This Newspaper Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The measures for borrowing, receiving, and purchasing enemy and puppet real estate for leasing, and the measures for settling the price and paying for the receipt of enemy and puppet property, have been discussed and approved by the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 16th. In the future, the use of enemy and puppet real estate and wharf warehouses by government agencies will be handled in accordance with the following measures: (1) Enemy and puppet real estate and warehouses not attached to wharves, which are used by several agencies, should continue to be handled in accordance with the current measures. Those used solely by one agency should be handled individually. (2) Enemy and puppet wharves and warehouses attached to wharves, which are used by temporary agencies, should temporarily maintain the status quo and be handled separately after the agency is closed. (3) Enemy and puppet wharves and warehouses attached to wharves should be sold at a price to state-owned enterprises in principle. State-owned enterprises have the priority to purchase the wharf warehouse. If there is any surplus after the state-owned enterprise purchases it, it should be sold to private enterprises. (4) Enemy and puppet wharves and warehouses used by government agencies (including military agencies) should be handled individually. (5) The principles for handling individual cases of government agencies using enemy and puppet real estate and wharf warehouses are as follows: First, the handling methods are divided into three types: price sale, lease, and transfer. The Central Trust Bureau is entrusted to handle price sales and leases. Second, enemy and puppet real estate and wharf warehouses should be sold at a price to state-owned enterprises in principle. Those who fail to pay the price in one lump sum may pay in installments. If specifically approved, it can also be leased for use. Third, government agencies (including military agencies) other than state-owned enterprises, who do have a need to use enemy and puppet real estate and wharf warehouses, should be transferred to them with the approval of the Executive Yuan.

### After the End of UNRRA: Relief Work Transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs

(4) After the end of UNRRA, foreign relief materials in various provinces should be managed by the Ministry of Social Affairs.

### Electricity Price Calculation Formula: Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Other Principles

[This Newspaper Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The National Economic Council drafted a price calculation formula for public utilities, including eight items for electricity price calculation, including fuel, foreign exchange, and wages. The Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that this formula cannot adapt to the whole country and is too complicated. Simple and easy implementation should be sought. Therefore, it consulted with relevant parties and electrical experts for detailed research and formulated other "Principles for Electricity Price Adjustment Calculation Formula," which only includes the major parts. One is the fuel cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity sold, and the other is the operating cost per kilowatt-hour of old electricity. It was sent to the National Economic Council for reference and to the National Electrical Industry Association for thorough discussion and reply, so that the final decision can be made, submitted to the Executive Yuan for record, and then implemented.

### South China Branch of the Import and Export Management Committee Established: Offices Set Up in Wuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Haikou

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 16th Dispatch] The South China Branch of the Import and Export Management Committee was established on the morning of the 16th. Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank and Chairman of the Committee, flew from Shanghai on the 15th to preside over the ceremony. Zhang pointed out the special economic situation in South China and gave detailed instructions on policies and guidelines. The branch's jurisdiction covers Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces, and the original Guizhou business will continue to be handled. Offices will be set up in Wuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Haikou.

[This Newspaper Guangzhou, 16th Dispatch] Zhang Ji'ao recently told reporters: He came here to preside over the establishment of the South China Branch of the Import and Export Management Committee and to inspect the affairs of the Central Branch. The main tasks of the establishment of the committee are: (1) To study the use of economic power to assist the government in cracking down on smuggling, so that export foreign exchange belongs to the government. If smuggling is reduced, the black market foreign exchange can also be reduced, and overseas remittances will not be wasted. (2) Investigate the needs of local people's livelihood and public utilities as a basis for quotas. (3) Investigate smuggling and study coping methods. (4) Announce central economic policies and orders and forward local difficulties to the central government. (5) Pay attention to increasing overseas remittances and study improvement methods. (6) Pay attention to changes in Hong Kong's economic and financial policies, take necessary measures, and maintain national and local interests at any time, while maintaining good economic relations between Guangdong and Hong Kong. Zhang also said: To eliminate the black market for gold and foreign exchange and the problem of smuggling, the main thing depends on the change in the psychology of the people. They must trust the government, sacrifice their personal petty interests, and love the country before there is a solution. Zhang said that the rumors that he would issue 50,000 yuan banknotes are all rumors.

### Zhang Fakui Encourages Subordinates: Implement the Three Observances and Three No's Movement

[This Newspaper Guangzhou, 16th Dispatch] Director Zhang Fakui of the Northeast Headquarters recently convened officers of various units under his command to encourage them to implement the "Three Observances," namely, observing time, observing discipline, and observing responsibility; and the "Three No's," namely, no selfishness, no corruption, and no falsehoods, in order to create a good atmosphere.

### UNRRA Director Rooks: Scheduled to Depart for China at the End of the Month: Discuss Unfinished Business of Relief Program

[Central News Agency Washington, 15th Dispatch] According to UNRRA officials, UNRRA Director Rooks will go to China at the end of this month to discuss the unfinished business of the relief program to China, which will end at the end of this year, with the Chinese government. According to Fa Jinren, Rooks's departure date has not been set, but he plans to go to China at the end of the month to investigate the progress of UNRRA's work in China and decide whether UNRRA should insist on its policy of no political discrimination in its distribution in China. It is reported that UNRRA is negotiating with our government to reach an agreement on the issue of material distribution in Communist-controlled areas. Observers here believe that if an agreement cannot be reached, the nine-nation central committee of UNRRA may ask the Chinese government to distribute approximately US$6 million worth of supplies designated for Communist areas, or may request a reduction in part of the relief program to China, so that UNRRA's attitude is that the Chinese government and the Communists have failed to reach an agreement on the transportation of materials to Communist areas and should not be blamed on the National Government. In addition, the unfinished business under the Chinese relief program includes approximately 30 million yuan worth of medical supplies and machinery needed for post-disaster relief. How to handle these matters is still awaiting Rooks's recommendation to the Central Committee.

### Trade Between Northeast and Inland: Adjustment Measures Revised Again: Headquarters Formulates Plan to Suppress and Stabilize Prices

[Central News Agency Shenyang, 16th Dispatch] Trade between the Northeast and the inland was originally restricted by the "Interim Measures for Adjusting the Import and Export of Goods" promulgated by the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters. In order to adapt to the current economic situation in the Northeast, adjust Northeast materials, and assist the resumption of work in industry and mining, the committee has revised the above measures again and announced them today. Exports are divided into three categories: (1) Freely Exported Category: Materials that are very abundant in the Northeast and needed in other places can be freely exported outside the Northeast without applying for permission. (2) Consigned Export Category: Materials that are abundant in the Northeast but also in great demand in the region, with a value of more than 50,000 circulating notes or a weight of more than 50 kilograms, should be applied for before export and consigned after approval. (3) Prohibited Export Category: Except for the needs of public institutions that have been approved by the Economic Committee, no consignments are allowed. This revision has actually eliminated the economic emergency measures plan previously announced by the committee but has not been effective. The plan did not have provisions for a freely exported category. As for soybeans and coal, which were originally prohibited from being withdrawn, separate instructions will be requested. The financial measures on tightening credit in the economic emergency measures plan will continue to be effective.

[This Newspaper Changchun, 16th Dispatch] The Northeast Headquarters is determined to suppress and stabilize prices, crack down on hoarding, and manage foreign exchange, and has prepared plans. Effective measures have also been taken for soybeans related to foreign exchange. Although the Sino-Soviet Railway is restored, it will also be partially frozen. Therefore, the price of soybeans in Changchun City has fallen since the afternoon yesterday, by more than ten yuan per catty.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Seeks to Increase Paper Production: Convenes Meeting of Relevant Agencies to Discuss: Formulate Improvement Opinions and Submit to the Executive Yuan for Approval

[This Newspaper Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] In order to increase paper production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently convened a meeting of relevant agencies and paper experts to discuss the current difficulties in the paper industry and formulated improvement opinions. The most lacking thing in our paper industry is fake raw materials. The country needs about 400 tons of pulp per day, but copper wire cloth and blankets are almost entirely dependent on imports. Domestically made blankets are not fully applicable. Our domestic wood cannot be produced in large quantities. The wood pulp produced by various factories in Sichuan, except for a part used to make banknote paper, is still not enough for the province. Taiwan's wood pulp and bagasse pulp, in addition to supplying the province's newspaper production, can be partially transported to Shanghai, but the villi are too short. The Jinzhou and Yingkou pulp mills in Tianjin and Northeast China all use reeds as their main raw material and have not yet started construction. Recently, there have been proposals to relocate the above-mentioned pulp mills internally, but it is not easy to implement them at once. As for the suggestion that pulp should be included as a major item in Soviet barter trade, it is a stopgap measure. The fundamental solution is to build our own factories. It is found that the foreign exchange spent on purchasing pulp and paper each year is about 18 million US dollars. If this foreign exchange is used to establish a pulp mill, the amount saved each year in the future will be more than this number. The cost of copper wire cloth and blankets is about 500,000 US dollars each. If a copper wire cloth factory and a blanket factory are established separately, they can ship goods after eighteen months, which is enough to meet the needs of all paper mills in China, and the foreign exchange saved each year will just match the above number. They are now being submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and are being submitted to the Resources Committee to study, select and implement them in conjunction with relevant agencies. Five Times Longer Than the Pearl River Bridge

### Guangzhou Southwest Grand Iron Bridge: Construction Will Resume Within Half a Year: Five Times Longer Than the Pearl River Bridge

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 15th Dispatch] The Guangzhou Southwest Grand Iron Bridge spans the Pearl River and is an important construction project for connecting the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway. A part of the bridge pier project was completed before the war. After the restoration, due to financial exhaustion, construction has not been resumed. In April of this year, the Municipal Government, the Provincial Government, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau negotiated the construction. At the beginning of August, it was decided to entrust the China Bridge Company to handle it. The required steel beams were requested by the Railway Bureau to be allocated by the Ministry of Transportation. The construction cost was advanced by the China Bridge Company and will be repaid from the fees collected from trains and cars passing through the bridge in the future. The contract was signed on September 1st, stipulating that construction will start within half a year after the signing of the contract. It will be completed within six months after all the towns and - have been transported. The bridge spans the Pearl River and its tributary river surface and is five times longer than the Pearl River Iron Bridge. The bridge deck is divided into train, car, and pedestrian lanes, and is the largest machine beam in the southwest.

### Encroached 30 Military Guns: Mo Yushuo and Li Jiewen Executed by Shooting in Guangzhou

Editorial

### The Critical Juncture of the United Nations

The second session of the United Nations General Assembly officially opened yesterday at Lake Success. At a time when numerous global issues are urgently awaiting resolution, the opening of the UN General Assembly undoubtedly brings renewed hope to the world. Consequently, all nations are giving this session their utmost attention. Our government's diplomatic authorities, in recognition of the significance of this UN General Assembly, have dispatched Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to personally attend. It is hoped that this session can dispel the international gloom and usher in an era of peace and prosperity, while also providing an opportunity to resolve the stalemate in the Far East. As Foreign Minister Wang stated in New York, "This General Assembly is the most important one yet and will determine the fate of the United Nations; we must ensure its success. For the sake of world peace, both Europe and Asia must swiftly achieve peace, or the situation will deteriorate to a point where major powers lose control. The issues to be discussed at the UN General Assembly are all of significant importance in maintaining world peace." Today's world has reached a critical juncture of unity and division. The success or failure of this UN General Assembly is tied to the safety of the world and the fate of humanity. The U.S. diplomatic authorities are also placing special emphasis on this session, not only offering their full support to the United Nations, but also striving to secure its success, ensuring that it becomes a truly effective international organization capable of maintaining world peace and promoting human well-being.

Over the past two days, the speeches heard and seen at the opening of the UN General Assembly have focused on praising the UN's peace efforts and proclaiming aspirations for future peace and security. This is certainly enough to strengthen the world's faith and hope in the UN, but it is premature to judge the success or failure of this session at this stage. Leaving aside the broader environment outside the UN General Assembly, the issues to be discussed at this session alone are enough to illustrate the immense challenges involved, which are beyond the imagination of most people. According to a United Press report, the most thorny difficulties facing this session include: (1) the issue of the veto power and its implications for amending the UN Charter; (2) breaking the impasse in the Korean situation; (3) resolving the Balkan issue; (4) the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states; (5) universal security, involving the control of atomic energy and the establishment of an international police force; (6) the Indonesian issue; (7) the disarmament of countries worldwide; (8) the handling of the Franco regime in Spain; (9) the racial discrimination issue in India and South Africa; and (10) other important international issues.

All the above issues contain complex and delicate international factors and are closely related to maintaining world peace. If this UN General Assembly fails to seize the opportunity and effectively utilize the situation to find reasonable solutions to these international problems, they could all erupt into sources of international conflict at any time. Certain nations with a special responsibility for world peace should particularly recognize the gravity of these issues and not take them lightly, allowing them to drag on and fester in the international undercurrents, eventually becoming sources of international chaos. As a United Press dispatch from New York on the 12th stated, "Not only is the agenda for this General Assembly filled with explosive issues, but the United States is also prepared to 'confront' the Soviet Union and determine who is stronger. Secretary of State Marshall will personally handle anti-communist actions. The eagle of the United States and the bear of the Soviet Union are about to engage in a cold war."

While United Press's report may be alarmist and exaggerated, it also has a certain basis. Although the U.S. government and public are united in supporting the United Nations and believe that it will never succeed without the enthusiastic support of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the vision that the U.S. government and public had when the United Nations was established during the war has now been completely shattered. This is truly a great tragedy for humanity. It is worth remembering that during the San Francisco Conference, all the United Nations were fighting shoulder-to-shoulder on the battlefield. Therefore, they were more willing to tolerate and compromise with each other at the conference, creating an atmosphere of harmony and friendship. A United Nations Charter was passed smoothly, serving as the basis for constructing world peace after the war. However, after the victorious end of the war, the UN organization, although holding various meetings in London and New York, has failed to achieve the intended effect due to internal disagreements. According to our statistics, the Soviet Union has exercised its veto power in the Security Council as many as eighteen times. How can the UN organization become an effective international body under these conditions? Therefore, the issue of the veto power is not only related to amending the UN Charter but also has a significant impact on the true effectiveness of the UN organization.

From this, we can also see that the root cause of the UN organization's paralyzed state lies in the irreconcilable differences between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. During the war, because victory was the priority, everyone was able to tolerate and compromise, cooperating sincerely and fighting shoulder-to-shoulder. But after victory, as circumstances changed, self-interest became the priority. On matters related to their own interests, the emotions of both sides deteriorated with each dispute, leading to an irreconcilable situation. The UN organization, caught in the conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, naturally finds it difficult to function effectively. Although the U.S. is in a leadership position and easily gains the sympathy of countries around the world, often gaining the upper hand in various UN meetings, the Soviet Union has the veto power, which is enough to counter the U.S., creating a stalemate. Therefore, we believe that as long as both the U.S. and the Soviet Union prioritize peace and their conscience is not blinded by selfish desires, and everyone treats each other with sincerity, not only will the dark clouds and grim atmosphere between the U.S. and the Soviet Union disappear immediately, but the international community will also immediately radiate the sunshine of peace. The problems facing the UN General Assembly will not be difficult to resolve.

In short, when we look up at the world today and then look down at the difficulties facing the United Nations, the future of the world is not something to be overly optimistic about. We only hope that the political and diplomatic leaders of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union can use their political wisdom to strive for the success of the United Nations. The U.S. diplomatic authorities are already moving in this direction, but we do not know if the Soviet Union will also take the same steps. The alignment of the steps of the U.S. and the Soviet Union will ensure the success of the United Nations. Therefore, the success or failure of the United Nations, the unity or division of the world, has reached a final juncture and will depend on the attitude and efforts taken by the representatives of the U.S. and the Soviet Union at this UN General Assembly.

### Greek Question Removed from UN Security Council Agenda - Soviet Union's Veto Fails

[Lake Success, 16th (Reuters)] After heated debate, the United Nations Security Council decided last night to remove the Greek issue from its agenda, allowing the UN General Assembly to discuss the matter. The debate began with discussion of a U.S. resolution requesting the General Assembly to resolve Greece's current difficulties. Australia supported the U.S. proposal, but the Soviet representative argued that this would further complicate the Greek issue. The French representative, Mr. Parodi, believed that since the Security Council's discussion of the Greek issue had reached a stalemate, the U.S. proposal might be a way to break it. At this point, Mr. Gromyko used his veto power to reject the U.S. proposal. The U.S. representative then proposed that the resolution be treated as a procedural matter, but this was also vetoed by the Soviet Union. The U.S. representative had no choice but to submit a new procedural resolution requesting that the Greek issue be removed from the agenda. As a procedural resolution, it was not subject to the veto power. The vote was nine in favor and two against (Soviet Union and Poland). Because the veto power did not apply, the motion was passed.

[Lake Success, 15th (United Press)] Tonight, the Soviet Union exercised its veto power twice in the UN Security Council to prevent the U.S. from bringing the Balkan issue to the UN General Assembly for discussion. However, the door for the General Assembly to discuss the issue was opened by another U.S. motion, which was passed despite Soviet opposition.

Soviet representative Mr. Gromyko stated that the U.S.'s new proposal had the same motive as the previously vetoed one, namely to implicate several innocent governments in order to exonerate the Greek government. This shows the extreme crudeness of U.S. foreign policy. The Balkan issue was earlier proposed by the U.S. to be included on the agenda of the General Assembly, but according to the UN Charter, the General Assembly's discussion should be limited to cases where the Security Council requests an opinion or removes the matter from its own agenda. Today, the U.S. proposed that the Security Council request the General Assembly to find a solution to the Balkan issue, which passed with nine votes in favor and two against, with the Soviet Union and Poland voting against. Soviet representative Mr. Gromyko, in his capacity as the rotating president of the Security Council for this month, ruled that this was a substantive issue and therefore could exercise his veto power. U.S. representative Mr. Johnson argued that it was a procedural matter, which passed with eight votes in favor, two against, and Syria abstaining, with the Soviet Union and Poland voting against.

### Soviet Merchant Ship Ignores Protests and Plans to Come to Shanghai Again; Anchors Outside the Port; We Reject the Soviet Consul-General's Request to Allow the "Erich" to Enter the Port; Authorities Closely Monitor Imports and Resolve to Detain It

[Reported by this newspaper] The Soviet ship "Erich" arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok on August 9th and September 4th this year to repatriate overseas Chinese in two batches, and violated our laws twice by carrying passengers and goods from Dalian to Shanghai without authorization. When the ship returned to its country last time, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with the Soviet authorities, and warned the ship not to enter the port again. Unexpectedly, before the previous case was closed, the ship dared to disregard our country's laws and ignore our protests, and sailed to Shanghai again at 11:45 am yesterday, anchoring on the Tongsha sea off Wusong. Upon receiving the report, the Shanghai Office of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately notified the Customs and Navigation authorities not to allow it to enter the port, and all procedures would not be processed. It also notified the Garrison Headquarters to send military police to monitor it. If the ship still attempts to enter the port rashly, it will be detained. According to reporters from relevant sources, the ship had not entered the port as of 10:00 pm last night.

It is reported that more than 1,000 Soviet overseas Chinese have registered for the third batch of ships to return to their country.

As for the ship carrying passengers and goods, it admitted its mistake. The reply also requested the cancellation of the ban on the "Erich" sailing to Shanghai again. After receiving the reply, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs resolutely refused to cancel the ban.

The words "Mayor Wu Guozhen" were written on the inside page in ink, seemingly with the intention of swindling. After Zhang reported to Mayor Wu for instructions, Mayor Wu believed that the madwoman's behavior might have some grievances or hidden circumstances, so he personally received her and asked her what she wanted. She answered vaguely. When asked why the words "Wu Guozhen" were written on the savings book, and whether she knew "Wu Guozhen", the madwoman said that she did not know Wu Guozhen. Finally, Mayor Wu asked her if she had been deceived by others or suffered any other harm, and promised to instruct his subordinates to investigate. The madwoman muttered incomprehensibly, and Zhang persuaded her to leave.

### Cracking Down on Soldiers Watching Plays Without Tickets: The Theater Industry Association Makes Three Demands: Petitions to the Municipal Government, Police Department, and Council

### Water Price Doubles: Director of Public Utilities Explains Reasons

The price of tap water will be adjusted starting from the 1st of this month, doubling the original price. According to Zhao Zengyu, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, the water company has been unable to settle foreign exchange at the official rate due to the implementation of the new foreign exchange control measures. The companies have suffered excessive losses and have requested the Bureau to forward their request to the Central Government to increase the subsidies given in May and June in order to maintain operations. Subsequently, Mayor Wu went to Beijing to meet with Zhang, the President of the Executive Yuan, for instructions. President Zhang decided that no further subsidies would be granted, but the companies were allowed to adjust their prices as appropriate. After reviewing the loss situation of each company, the Bureau approved a price increase of one time the original price. The adjusted prices are as follows: (1) The original price of the British and French water companies was 1,250 yuan per cubic foot, now selling for 2,500 yuan. (2) The original price of the Pudong, Zhabei, and Inland water companies was 1,450 yuan per cubic meter, now selling for 2,900 yuan.

Director Zhao also stated that the adjustment of gas prices is currently under study with the gas company regarding costs, price calculations, penalty methods, and by-products. Adjustments may not be made within this month.

### ### Bloodshed on Haifang Road: Murderer Enters Room by Window at Dawn and Brutally Chops with Axe - Husband Dies, Wife Wounded

[Our Newspaper] Shen Rongji's Yarn Factory owner, Shen Youren, 42, from Shaoxing, who resided in a bungalow at No. 358, Lane 391, Haifang Road in Western Shanghai, lost his wife, Ms. He, to illness ten years ago, leaving behind a son, named Hen, 15, and a daughter, Qingying, 14. Due to the lack of a person to manage the household, he remarried a widow from Ningbo, Zhang Shixiang (44 years old), as his wife through an introduction. For the past nine years, their relationship has been good. They had two sons and a daughter, but both sons have died young, leaving only a daughter, Rongmei, who is only four years old. The family of five lived harmoniously. Shen, his wife Zhang, and his young daughter Rongmei slept together on the loft above the front building. Unexpectedly, at around 5 a.m. at dawn, a thug removed four sections of the window lattice, climbed inside, shone a flashlight on Shen's face, and then brutally chopped Shen's neck with a sharp axe, about an inch deep. Shen quickly got up in pain and saw someone escaping through the window. He bravely jumped down to chase, but accidentally fell to the ground, causing a hole in the back of his head, and his breath was faint. At this time, another thug remained in the room. Zhang was awakened by the noise in her sleep and got up to grab his hand, but because the lights were off, she couldn't recognize his face. She didn't know it was the murderer, and she was chopped six or seven times on her chest, right chest, and breasts, with blood gushing out like a spring. She released her hand in pain.

The culprit then fled. After being injured, she rushed downstairs, but fainted from the pain at the entrance of West Grave Lane downstairs. At that time, Shen's nephew, Yonglin, and neighbor, Xi Tian, and others heard the noise and went out to investigate, seeing Zhang covered in blood and Shen Youren barely breathing. They quickly called an ambulance to the scene and rushed the injured to Pingmin Hospital on Xinzha Road. Shen died soon after due to his serious injuries.

Xi Tian immediately reported the robbery to the Jiangning Police Branch, and Branch Chief Wang Xinheng personally led Section Chief Chen Kaizhou, Police Chief Wang Qi, and others to the scene of the incident to investigate the details of the tragedy. After receiving the report, the Criminal Investigation Section of the General Bureau also ordered staff member Chen Xianrong to rush to the scene and photograph the culprit's footprints to facilitate the investigation. According to eyewitnesses, they saw two people in black clothes fleeing away at the time, so it can be confirmed that there were actually two criminals. As for Zhang's remarriage, her previous husband passed away ten years ago. It is impossible to determine whether it contains an affair. However, according to the police officers handling the case, Zhang is over forty years old and one of her eyes is already blind, so it seems that the element of revenge is more likely. The branch is currently secretly investigating this.

### ### "Tangyuan Little Wu's" List of Crimes: Skilled at "Eating Soft Rice" Among the Female Entertainers

There are countless cases of men defrauding women of their jewelry in Shanghai. Wu Baoxiang, nicknamed "Tangyuan Little Wu," 30 years old, from Hangzhou (also known as Wu Boxiang), was arrested by the police for fraud and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office on the 10th of this month. It is now learned that the District Prosecutor's Office has completed the investigation procedures because the suspect has confessed to his crimes to the police. Yesterday, Prosecutor Chen Shoutao filed a public prosecution. The reporter has learned the truth as follows: Wu Baoxiang, unemployed, specializes in setting up scams to make a living. He studied at National Fudan University and left the school in 1937. He then worked as a second-class postal officer at the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. After the war, he was transferred to Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai in 1941, where he worked in the stock exchange. Since then, he has engaged in this illegal behavior. From June of last year to April of this year, he has successively used despicable means to defraud a large amount of property, totaling seven cases. The first time was in June of last year, when Wu met a dancer named Pan Liping at the Sichuan Road nightclub. Seeing that Pan had a flat gold bracelet on her hand, he became malicious. The next day, he managed to invite the dancer to the Yiyuan Nightclub. When the dancing ended, he

Used the excuse of admiration

To trick her and escape into the crowd. The next day, he went to the Xintianhua Silver Building on Baoshan Road in Zhabei and exchanged it for 320,600 yuan, and there is an invoice from the building to prove it. The second time was at 10 a.m. on August 17 last year, Wu impersonated a friend named Mao Hongfa and called No. 96 Jing'an Villa, claiming to collect three pieces of Western-style clothing materials. After obtaining them, he sold one piece to a friend from Taiwan, Wang Jiu, and made the other two pieces into Western suits himself. The third time was on September 13 last year, when he met a former dancer named Li at the Weida Dance Hall on Xiahfei Road. Li was eager to return to Qingdao, but was worried about the lack of travel expenses, so she asked Wu to exchange her gold bracelet for cash. Wu pretended to be honest and paid Li 100,000 yuan first. Later, Wu embezzled the 320,000 yuan he exchanged for his own use. The fourth time was at 9 a.m. on October 4 last year, Wu again

Played a new trick

Carrying a red mesh bag with a brand new 1,000-yuan bill visible on the outside, seemingly a large amount of cash, but in fact, only the surface was a 1,000-yuan bill, and the inside was all grass paper. He went to Yunxia Fashion Company at No. 988 Nanjing West Road to buy clothing materials, and instructed them to send the pre-selected yellow wolf fur coat and woolen coat to Room 313, Yuelai Apartment, No. 592 Lane, Nanjing West Road. Wu went there as promised and put the fake money on the table first. When the fashion company clerk arrived, he falsely claimed that he needed to take the coat to his girlfriend's room across the street to try it on, leaving the money on the table. The clerk did not suspect anything else and was tricked. Wu went to Pudong Dongchang Road and pawned it that day for his own use. The fifth time was at 9 a.m. in November last year, Wu tricked Li Huifang, whom he met through

Wang Ji Photo Studio

into going out to play after meeting at Room 38, Pacific Hotel, No. 12, Lane 470, Shaanxi North Road, and then used the excuse of admiring them to trick her out of her jewelry worth 3 taels and 8 mace, and two 3-carat diamond rings. He exchanged them for 897,000 yuan at the Lao Tianbao Silver Building in Xiaodongmen, and sold the two 3-carat diamond rings to his friend Wang Jie, all of which were used up. The sixth time was on February 20 of this year, Wu went to the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall on Nanjing Road and took the dancer Ni Yaomei to the Dahu Dance Hall to play. When the dance ended, he used the excuse of playing with Ni's gold bracelet on his hand and ran away. He then exchanged it for 600,000 yuan at the Central Bank for his own use. The seventh time was in late April of this year, Wu danced with friends at the Atlantic Cafe, and thus met a prostitute named Sanyuan. Through Sanyuan's introduction, he met another prostitute named Meimei (also known as Wu Fengjin). Wu saw that Meimei had a lot of jewelry and immediately had evil intentions. Later, he invited Wu to drink coffee, dance, and watch movies, and then invited her to Room 207 of the Shanghai Hotel in Hongkou. Under the pretext of urging Meimei to take a bath, he stole her jewelry and exchanged it for more than 5 million yuan. He spent it all in Hangzhou that night. The above seven fraud facts have been proven, and all have been confirmed in detail by the victims as being committed by "Tangyuan Little Wu." His behavior of making fraud his regular occupation is truly unforgivable.

### Visiting Ancient Relics in Linqiong

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 13th] Qionglai County in Western Sichuan suffered from floods last month, and the Xihe River in the county overflowed, with many dikes along the river being destroyed. On the 28th, the flood collapsed the riverbank of Banzhulin in the west of the city. The next day, Tang Dynasty relics were discovered at the collapsed riverbank, including various kinds of stone carvings, sculptures, and castings. There are also many Yuan Dynasty stone carvings, exquisitely carved and magnificently sculpted, of great historical value. This has aroused the research interest of archaeological and historical scholars in Southwest China. Yesterday, the reporter drove to the site of the ancient relics to take a look.

Qionglai is 180 miles east of Chengdu, formerly known as Linqiong. In the Qing Dynasty, it was changed to Qiong Prefecture, and in the Republic of China, it was changed to its current name. It is the hometown of the famous literary figures Sima Xiangru and Zhuo Wenjun's elopement. On the morning of the 11th, the reporter took a bus from Chengdu. Along the way, the autumn rice was early ripening, the wheat ears were growing strongly, and the branches were drooping like grapes. Farmers were busy threshing and drying grain. Near the river, there were still dilapidated tiles, broken walls, sandy and stony fields, and many collapsed buildings. Everywhere there were refugees after the disaster, skinny and haggard, living in temporary shelters. The signs of the flood were clearly visible. At noon, they arrived in Qionglai. The shops in the city were densely packed and quite prosperous. There are many relics of romantic stories here, such as Sima Xiangru's reading place, the place where he played the zither to entice Zhuo Wenjun, and the place where Zhuo Wenjun sold wine by the stove. After entering the city, after a brief visit, they went to the Folk Education Hall to see the ancient relics.

At the museum, they heard from the person in charge that this batch of ancient relics was discovered on the 28th of last month after a flood collapsed the Xihe River (Qiongshui), and a dozen meters of the dike on the south side of the city was destroyed. But many of them were taken away by local tyrants, and the government only saved part of them. He guided the reporter to visit the first part, which was stone carvings, statues of Buddha, Vajra guardians, Dharma protectors, Guanyin, etc., with inscriptions such as Kai Cheng (Emperor Wenzong of Tang Dynasty), Xian Tong (Emperor Wuzong of Tang Dynasty), etc. The iron strokes and silver hooks are exquisitely carved, the lines are smooth, and the shapes and structures are lively and solemn. They look lifelike, and the performance is quite similar to the Western Realist style, which can be compared with the Tang Dynasty murals in the Mogao Caves. The second part is bronze castings and stone sculptures of large and small Buddha statues. The larger ones are seven or eight feet high, and the smaller ones are only five or six inches. The lines of the wheels and temples are beautiful and lively, and the jewelry, hair, eyebrows, and eyes on the head are extremely vivid. There is a bronze Guanyin statue that looks like a Qiang person and is several feet tall. It fully expresses the solemnity and greatness of Buddhism, and is inscribed with Huichang (Emperor Xuanzong of Tang Dynasty) three years. The third part is various sutra pillars and stupas. The sizes and forms of the sutra pillars are different, the designs are beautiful, and the carvings are exquisite. The smaller ones are only a ruler in size, with octagonal edges, each side being only two inches. It imitates the famous Xinhai Road Protection Monument in Chengdu. The Sutra says that it was built in the eighth year of Xiantong and that the strokes are as fine as hair and are still very clear despite the erosion. The stupa is cleverly small and exquisite, resembling the Big Goose Pagoda in Xi'an. Both are suspected to be the works of famous masters. In addition, there are also some Yuan Dynasty cloud dot stone carvings, the larger ones being a foot in size, and the smaller ones about four or five inches. It was built in the fifteenth year of Zhizheng, and the production is also very exquisite.

After browsing, the reporter returned to Chengdu in the twilight with a feeling of joy and admiration. At the same time, he deeply felt that China is an ancient civilized country, but many of China's cultural relics and treasures have fallen into the hands of foreigners for collection and research. The Tang Dynasty was a prosperous era for the Chinese nation, but there are very few regulations and cultural relics handed down. Furthermore, after checking, the cultural relics discovered this time were all made during the time of Emperors Wenzong, Wuzong, and Yizong of the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Wuzong was the number one enemy of Buddhism. In the fifth year of Huichang (845 AD), he ordered the destruction of Buddhist temples throughout the country and ordered monks and nuns to return to secular life. Buddhists called it the "Disaster of the Three Wu." Why were there Tibetan monks, temples, and such brilliant Buddhist objects during the time of Emperor Yizong? This is a question worthy of study by historians and archaeologists. The reporter deeply hopes that the discovery of this ancient treasure will arouse enthusiastic research interest in the long-silent Chinese academic community. In today's turbulent times, this may not be a cultural event. (Reporter Zhou Xueduan)

### ### Alishan Forest Farm in Taiwan Province Plans to Develop Nanzi Xianxi

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] Alishan, known as the treasure house of forests in Taiwan Province, has seen a sharp decline in forest reserves in recent years due to large-scale logging. According to statistics, there are currently only more than 470,000 stone of timber left. Based on the existing timber collection equipment, it is estimated that all of it can be cut and transported within three years, ending the great business of the forest area in the past. The Alishan Forest Farm has planned to develop the virgin land of Nanzi Xianxi in Kaohsiung County. According to preliminary investigations, the Nanzi Xianxi forest area has a total area of 1,844 hectares, with a timber reserve of 1,435.134 stone, 398.967.272 cubic meters. At a felling rate of 140,000 stone per year, it can continue to be logged for ten years. Detailed plans have been drafted by relevant parties, mainly to extend the Alishan Forest Railway. Ten kilometers of new railway need to be built to enter the depths of the forest area and can be completely felled and transported. The engineering work will be carried out in two phases, and is expected to be completed within three years. The Alishan Forest Farm will organize a survey team to depart to Nanzi Xianxi for a detailed survey.

### ### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Needs Vehicles Urgently, Bureau Plans to Improve Operations

[Our Newspaper, Jinhua, 12th] Since the Hangrao section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been opened to traffic, there has been a shortage of vehicles. The 69 passenger cars and 369 freight cars urgently needed by the section have been repeatedly telegraphed to the Ministry of Communications for urgent allocation. However, except for a portion of the freight cars transported from Qingdao, the passenger cars have not yet been allocated, making it extremely difficult to serve passengers. The bureau has recently temporarily borrowed ten vehicles from the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways. If they can be allocated as planned, the passenger transport on this section will be further improved. Also, the bureau attaches great importance to the current traffic situation in Hangrao. Bureau Chief Hou Jiayuan has personally instructed Engineering Department Chief Qing Chengdao, Transportation Department Chief Du Xiang, and Deputy Chief of the Machinery Department Zhou Yuangu to travel from Hangzhou to Jinhua and then to various stations on the Qurao line to inspect operations and seek improvements.

### ### One-Legged Thief Dares to Rob Watch Store in Changzhou's Bustling Downtown Area

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 14th] There have been many robberies in the eastern suburbs of this county recently. On the night of the 13th, at around 10:30 p.m., Zhenxingxiang Watch Store in Mishi River outside the West Gate was preparing to close when a person wearing a raincoat on the outside and a military uniform on the inside suddenly arrived. He was about 30 years old, with a northern accent, bald head, and long rectangular face. He held a Thompson submachine gun and charged straight in, immediately bolting the door and forcing the store employees into the back kitchen. He called out the person in charge of the store, Dai Wenbin, and forced him to hand over the keys to open the till. He then took 26 watches, 41 watch chains, and 100,000 yuan in cash, bundled them into a package, and forced them into the kitchen, locking the door before escaping with the loot. The store owner immediately telegraphed the robbery to the police bureau for arrest, but no results were obtained.

### Zibo Mining Area Survey: Fearful Rule with Novelty in Abundance

[Our Newspaper Jinan Seventh Dispatch] Our reporter arrived in Zibo on the twelfth day after the National Army entered Zibo. However, everywhere, one could still see slogans, leaflets, and announcements left behind by the Communist bandits. Especially in Boshan, the Communist bandits even established a pseudo "Shandong Provincial Luzhong Public School" next to the Daliukeng Shandong Provincial Model Pottery Factory. The Fanguan Temple in the city had been used as a pseudo Party and government cadre training class. Shantou Village in the south of the city had once served as the office of the pseudo Shandong Provincial Government. Therefore, perhaps Boshan was the center of the Lu Communist political, economic, and cultural activities. As far as I could see, nearly half of the Communist bandits' slogans on the walls of the houses remained intact. At first, I was a little puzzled by this. After questioning many ordinary people from various angles, I learned that the Communist bandits had told them before retreating that they would return in two months for the "Fourth Liberation." Anyone who removed the slogans would be killed without question. Before retreating, the bandits also posted many large-scale announcements. Our reporter witnessed many such announcements in the Zibo area. Among them, the most shocking was the following: Emergency Announcement by the Luzhong Administrative Office (War Character No. 1)

Item 1: Landlords, Homecoming Corps, local bullies, secret agents, anyone who has one of the following facts will be sentenced to death.

(1) Reporting village cadres to the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents, causing harm to their lives and property.

(2) Directly assassinating village cadres and emancipated peasants.

(3) Reporting public grain, military affairs, capital, or public property to the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents, resulting in losses.

(4) Reporting or directly stealing militia weapons and ammunition to the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents.

(5) Coercing peasants to give up the fruits of struggle.

(6) Reporting the names of military workers to the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents, resulting in punishment.

(7) Leading the Chiang Army or Chiang secret agents to rape civilian women.

(8) Leading the welcome of the Chiang Army, or the Chiang Army's offices requisitioning grain, money, and labor from the people.

(9) Smearing or destroying slogans, leaflets, or propaganda materials of the People's Liberation Army, democratic government, and mass organizations.

Item 2: Landlords, Homecoming Corps, local bullies, secret agents, those who have the following facts will be treated leniently.

(10) Those who genuinely repent of their past mistakes, no longer serve Chiang, and confess their sins to the democratic government and start anew.

This announcement.

Director: Ma Futang

Deputy Director: Cheng Zhaoxuan

July, 1947

Even welcoming the National Army or smearing slogans would be sentenced to capital punishment.

The Communist bandits completely relied on a policy of terror to maintain their cruel rule. This is evident from this. Not only that, but according to some ordinary people who have suffered under the Communist bandits, bullets are too precious for the Communist bandits and are not used easily. Therefore, for executions, they never adopted the method of shooting. Of course, on the other hand, this was precisely to strengthen the terror and make the people know what to fear. Therefore, their criminal laws were too numerous to list. In addition to the "stone stewed meat," etc., mentioned in the previous section, here are several more types as told by the ordinary people and as far as I can remember:

(1) Tank Team - Two giant stone rollers are framed with wood and dragged by cattle and horses, so that the person to be punished stands between the two rollers, moving on a rugged road until their legs are broken and their feet crushed.

(2) Looking at the "Chiang" Army from a Hundred-Foot Pole - The punishment method for leading the welcome of the National Army is to use a long pole to tie the person to be punished to the top of the pole. After the pole is erected, the rope is cut, and the person is smashed to death, called looking at the "Chiang" Army from a hundred-foot pole.

(3) Roasted Pig - The person to be punished is sealed in a jar and firewood is burned around it, called roasted pig.

(4) Repentance Soup - Pouring urine and feces on the head and face of the person to be punished until they "confess without hesitation" to the crimes added by the Communist bandits, called "Repentance Soup."

(5) Pulling the Electric Wire - The person to be punished is ordered to kneel on a six- or seven-layer or eight- or nine-layer high table. Someone ties a rope to the table leg in advance, and suddenly pulls the rope unexpectedly. The table falls, and the person is also smashed to death, called "Pulling the Electric Wire."

(6) Lighting the Sky Lantern - Pouring oil on the top of the head and setting it on fire, called "Lighting the Sky Lantern."

(7) Upside-Down Planting - Digging a pit about six feet deep, burying the person alive with their head down and their feet up, called upside-down planting.

(8) Artificial Fountain - Burying the lower body of the person to be punished in the soil, so the blood is naturally forced upwards. While they are crying out in pain, iron nails are hammered into their head and suddenly pulled out, so that hot blood spurts out, called "Artificial Fountain."

(9) Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Wind - Confining a person in a dark room and stabbing their abdomen with a needle is called metal, hitting them hard with a stick is called wood, hanging a person upside down and pouring chili water into their nostrils is called water, placing a person in a jar and roasting them with fire all around is called fire, burying them alive is called earth, and hanging a person naked from a hundred-foot high pole is called wind.

The Communist bandits used this kind of extremely inhuman harsh punishments to rule their "liberated areas." However, harsh punishments ultimately could not completely suppress the people's hearts that yearn for freedom. In many places, even before the National Army arrived, many people still went to welcome them secretly, regardless of everything. As soon as the National Army arrived, the national flag with a blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red earth was automatically hung at the door of every household. During the period of the Communist bandit occupation, they protected this national flag more than they protected their lives. When the National Army needed to requisition laborers and grain, they were able to donate and transport them enthusiastically. Due to the lessons of the three advances and three retreats in the Zibo area in the past, their only hope for the National Army is that they will not retreat again in the future; otherwise, they will be subjected to deeper trampling and revenge by the Communist bandits. A few days ago, a rumor spread that the National Army was about to retreat again, and the suffering people did not know what to do. Finally, they were forced to guard the city gate by common consent, preparing to retreat with the National Army at the same time. In their minds, there were sentries of the National Army at the city gate. If the National Army really retreated, they could leave with the sentries. Later, more and more people gathered. After a senior officer of the National Army explained that it was a "change of guard" and not a "retreat," the ordinary people dispersed one after another. This proves that under the Communist bandits' rule of terror, the people's hearts still tend towards the government. The only question is how the government should win over the hearts of these people who have been trampled upon by the Communist bandits. This is by no means limited to passive relief and comfort, which can solve the problem. What is especially important is how to actively train them and lead them, "using organization against organization" and "using force against force," so that they can return to their hometowns armed, live and work in peace, and not let the people feel threatened in any way of their survival again.

### Chengdu Leshan Hall Leader Creates False Rumors of a Sichuan Flood Demon, Fooling People to Jump into Water, One Dead and Four Revived

[Our Newspaper Chengdu Thirteenth Dispatch] A shocking case of spreading rumors to confuse the public has been cracked near Chengdu. Zhang, the leader of Leshan Hall in Wangmiao Street, outside Lvrong Dong, often wears Bagua clothing, gathers his followers, spreads rumors, deceives people, and extorts money. He has many believers. Nearby, there is the Xihe Weaving Factory, where hundreds of workers are half-bewitched by the cult. On the 28th of last month, Zhang said to the public: "The recent floods in western Sichuan are caused by the gods using floods to save those with predestined relationships. Those who aspire to become immortals can go to the Fulong Temple in Guanxian to jump into the water and dissolve their corpses, and they will immediately attain immortality and enjoy the pleasures of the Dragon Palace forever." Five people, including female worker Bao Gu and male workers Zhang Zhijun and Du Gaolin, believed this to be true. On the 31st, they took a bus to Guanxian together. Near the Suojiang Bridge in Dujiangyan, they calmly jumped into the water and drifted away with the waves. People on the shore witnessed this scene and were horrified, but because the waves were turbulent and the current was rapid, they could not rescue them in time. Fortunately, the five people were swept to Jintong when three of them were bravely rescued by the weir workers. Except for Zhang Zhijun, who had drowned, two people were resuscitated on the spot. The next day, the Guanxian County Government sent staff to take care of them and inquired about the original plan. They urgently telegraphed the provincial government, and the Rong security authorities arrested the evil man. The cult leader had already escaped after hearing the news. The municipal government has now disbanded and sealed the Hall of Goodness. Zhang is being pursued.

### Jiangsu Province Orders the Requisition and Loan of Military Grain, with Good Responses from Various Counties and Districts

[Our Newspaper Wujin Fifteenth Dispatch] This county received a provincial order to requisition and borrow 45,200 shi of military grain and paddy, with half of it to be collected by September 20 and the full amount to be collected by October 5 for allocation. As the new grain has not yet entered the market and it is the time of year where one crop is depleted and another not yet harvested, it is difficult to borrow such a large amount of rice. For this matter, the county government specially convened local party groups and various industries to hold meetings and negotiate continuously for two days. After detailed exploration, the result was to use the method of dividing the whole into parts. Various industries separately recognized and borrowed 1,000 to 2,000 shi each. The total amount of 32,500 shi was recognized by the grain and wood industries. The rest was purchased by industries that were not assigned. As for grain purchase loans, major manufacturers negotiated with various banks to determine that the National Bank would borrow 1.5 billion yuan, and commercial banks would borrow 500 million yuan. The conditions were to use the warehouse receipts of major manufacturers as collateral, and the procedures were simplified as much as possible.

[Our Newspaper Jiangyin Fifteenth Dispatch] The county government convened an emergency meeting of various agencies on the 13th to discuss the provincial order for advance borrowing of land tax. It was decided that: (1) The county chamber of commerce will be responsible for allocating and borrowing 3,000 shi of tax grain. (2) The remaining 17,000 shi will be allocated and borrowed by the Land and Grain Office according to the proportion of land tax in each district, township, and town. (3) The 4,200 shi of outstanding tax grain have been sold by the county government. How to raise funds will be determined by including this quota in the quota of township borrowing. If any household delays, they will be punished for delaying military grain.

[Our Newspaper Yixing Fourteenth Dispatch] This county has a large number of outstanding land taxes for the 35th year.

### Regarding the Issue of Higher Education in the Northeast, Shenyang Schools Express Their Opinions, Chen Cheng Hopes That Famous Professors Inside the Pass Will Go to the Northeast to Assist

[Our Newspaper Shenyang Sixteenth Dispatch] Today, the issue of higher education in the Northeast was conceptualized at a symposium of the Northeast education community called by Chen Cheng on the 15th (see the first page of yesterday's newspaper). Liu Shusheng, the acting president of Northeast University, said that security and price fluctuations have been greater in recent years, and that professors coming to the Northeast symbolize stability. Yu Xiezong, the acting president of Zhongzheng University, said that the Northeast was occupied for 14 years, and education must be started from scratch. Due to traffic and political relations, it is difficult to hire more professors. In addition, the lives of students should be stabilized to prevent them from acting rashly. Luo Yunping, the director of general affairs of Northeast University, said that the Northeast should pay special attention to education because it has national defense significance, but there is a lack of books and instruments, and professors have a hard life, which makes it difficult to achieve the above goals. Professors at Shenyang Medical College asked to solve the problem of winter coal use and the remittance of funds back home by Japanese professors and the remittance of funds inside the pass by Chinese professors. Fang Yongzheng, the president of the Weibai Normal College, said that the youth of the Northeast need education, have a high desire for knowledge, and are easy to teach. Professor Liu Gongyun said that the Japanese paid attention to practical science and hoped that this advantage would not be erased. He also hoped that the funds from punishing the hoarding, corruption, and extravagance would be used to run education. Wang Shulin, the dean of Zhongzheng University, said that the lives of professors are not as good as those of rich people's dogs, and the poor people are even worse. He also hoped that all parties would withdraw from schools. Chen Cheng hoped that everyone would recognize the security of the Northeast, engage in psychological construction, and hoped that famous professors inside the pass would not regard the Northeast as a dangerous place and would come north to assist the government in building education in the Northeast.

### Shanghai Jewish School Implements New Education Plan Emphasizing Hands-On Training

The Shanghai Jewish School will implement a new education plan this fall. This plan has already achieved remarkable success abroad, and this is its first introduction to Shanghai. In the past, critics of today's education system have often said that our schools rely too much on books and fail to instill practical knowledge in children, leaving them ill-prepared to cope with the hardships of life.

Since the educational reforms of Froebel, Montessori, and others, primary and secondary schools have increasingly emphasized "hands-on" training. After World War I, most experimental schools in Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the United Kingdom, the United States added vocational training classes to their curricula.

The Shanghai Jewish School will implement a similar plan this semester, adding compulsory sewing and woodworking courses in addition to the existing curriculum. The aim is not only to develop manual skills but also to provide students with complete vocational training, so that after leaving school, they will have skills to earn a living. The original intention of this vocational training is to encourage Jews to learn various crafts. Under Hitler's tyranny, many Jewish doctors, lawyers, and university professors who were expelled from their countries and roamed other lands found it difficult to make a living. However, some who had received vocational training were able to work as locksmiths, radio experts, or plumbers to support themselves. Many successful Jewish immigrants in this city have received such vocational training. In the future, Jewish schoolchildren in this city will also receive this kind of training.

### Second Day of the Foreign Trade Conference Speeches and Proposal Reviews Zhang Jia'ao Speaks on Foreign Exchange Policy and the New Mission of Trade The General Assembly Will Continue Today and Is Scheduled to Close This Afternoon

[Our Report] The National Foreign Trade Conference continued at the City Chamber of Commerce at 10 AM yesterday, with more than 100 representatives attending, chaired by Huang Zaisou. According to the original schedule, President Zhang Jia'ao of the Central Bank was to deliver a speech entitled "China's New Foreign Exchange Policy and the New Mission of Import and Export Trade." However, because Mr. Zhang had to go to Guangzhou on official business, Director Li of the Quota Allocation Office delivered the speech on his behalf. The main points were as follows:

(1) Before the war, China's trade deficit was compensated by remittances from overseas Chinese, foreign investment, and silver exports. However, the eight-year war of resistance damaged the country's economic vitality, and the frequent Communist disturbances left no time for recovery, leading to the current difficult situation.

(2) The new regulations for the management of foreign exchange promulgated on August 16 are a relatively reasonable measure. After the implementation of this new policy, the legal tender prices of imported goods will not fall excessively, and excessive profits will not accrue to importers, and domestic similar products will not be threatened. The export prices can gradually balance with other domestic prices, so as to encourage exports and promote production.

(3) It is believed that after the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy, the foreign exchange market can be expected to stabilize.

(4) The control of import trade is not a government policy that tends to control, but is out of necessity. Otherwise, the expenditure of foreign exchange will be impossible to estimate, and hoarding will be impossible to prevent.

(5) The qualification review for importer registration will be based on the turnover in 1946, and the registration review standards will be slightly expanded. In addition, those who have the qualification to exclusively operate famous foreign manufacturers will also be allowed to register. Factories that directly import raw materials for their own use before and after the war, even if the quantity is not large, can also obtain registration qualifications.

(6) The ultimate benefit of imported materials should belong to the consumer from the national standpoint. Whether factories or importers, they are both in the position of transferors and should be satisfied with legal profits.

(7) It is hoped that domestic products will reduce costs and improve quality, and that operators will develop great vision and a spirit of cooperation to facilitate exports.

Declaring a Stand, Emotions Aroused

After Li Gan finished reading, he hurriedly left. The original schedule was for Zhao Dihua to deliver a speech on "Economic Construction and International Financial Institutions." However, because Mr. Zhao was in Beijing, the speech was also read by the conference secretary on his behalf. It elaborated on the basic understanding of international lending and the structure and operation of international banks.

At this time, the atmosphere at the venue felt rather dull. The climax of the morning meeting was the discussion of the Legislative Yuan's request to dissolve and reorganize the National Federation of Commerce. Emotions ran high for a time, and the language was sharp. As a result, it was decided to hold a joint meeting of representatives of chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities at the Jin Gu Hotel tonight to unanimously declare their position on this matter.

At noon, the National Shipping Association hosted a banquet for all the representatives at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Mr. Du Yuesheng delivered a speech, advocating the maintenance of the national shipping industry and the development of foreign trade, believing that the shipping industry is a "subsidiary industry" to commerce and has an inseparable relationship with the prosperity of the national economy. The income from intangible export trade can also compensate for the difference in the balance of international payments.

Yang Guanbei and Xu Xueyu spoke in succession, both believing that the export industry and the shipping industry are closely related. The United Kingdom has spent a lot of effort to protect its shipping industry, in terms of civil law and government cooperation, which is worthy of our country's example.

Group Meetings to Review Proposals

Group meetings were held from 2 PM, dividing into five groups: export, import, foreign exchange, transportation insurance, and special groups, to review proposals, totaling more than 90 items. The discussion was very heated, especially in the export and import groups, until about 6 PM, when they all came to an end. After the various proposals were revised and summarized, they will be submitted to the general assembly today for approval.

At 7 PM, the Banking Association, the Silver and Money Industry Association, the Insurance Industry Association, and the Trust Industry Association hosted all the representatives. Xu Guomao delivered a speech, saying that the current deposits of commercial banks are only about one trillion yuan, and most of them are short-term deposits, which is equivalent to less than 25 million yuan before the war, which is really not enough to meet the needs of legitimate industry and commerce. It is hoped that the country's future financial policy can be coordinated with the effort to increase production.

Shen Rixin delivered a speech on behalf of the Silver and Money Industry Association, saying that it is rumored that the policy will import tobacco raw materials from the United States, which can be used domestically for three years. If this news is true, it will be detrimental to domestic agricultural production, and it is hoped that the representatives attending the meeting will pay attention to it.

Subsequently, Ningxia representative Qiao Senrong delivered a reply speech. In addition to expressing gratitude for the hospitality, he asked those present to pay attention to the symptoms of the Northwest wool cargo being abandoned on the ground, and hoped that the industrial circles of this city could invest in the Northwest and set up factories. It was not until about 8 PM that everyone dispersed with pleasure.

Speeches by Foreign Guests at Today's General Assembly

The plenary session will continue at 9 AM this morning, and Mr. John, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, has been specially invited to speak on "The Problems of Import and Export Trade in China at the Present Stage." Dr. Yang Ge, Consultant of the Central Bank, will speak on "The Expansion of China's Export Trade." Ms. Zhang Xiaomei will speak on "The Balance of International Payments in Our Country." In the afternoon, the group review reports will be discussed, and the general assembly declaration will be passed. The general assembly is scheduled to close today.

### British Exchange Rate Lowered

For the buying and selling prices of designated banks, please refer to the commercial information column below.

### Tight Money Market Continues to Hamper the Decline of Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks yesterday, due to the excessive congestion of off-market deliveries, experienced difficulties, and the interest rate was forced to rise to 2 jiao 1 and 2 jiao 5 and a half fen, which was extremely unfavorable in the middle. However, when the salary was paid by Fangjian the day before, because the large bills were insufficient, the 1 million yuan check from the China Bank Trust Department was used instead, and it was actually associated with a huge amount of bank notes. The people's hearts were still fluctuating, and there was still some improvement after the decline. In the end, due to the continued tight money market, the afternoon trading still felt completely inflexible.

Early Morning

High prices were seen due to the 2,000 yuan contraction in the British exchange rate and the mystery of the parallel line notes, but this kind of psychological opening was dispelled. After Yongsha opened, it stepped down to 237 yuan and 240 yuan due to the departure of No. 65 and others. No. 117 and No. 134 still entered, and once pulled Yongsha up to 244 yuan. After entering, it was affected by the inability to deliver goods off-market and the substantial increase in interest rates. No. 104 and others vigorously dumped Yongsha, and No. 223 and others sold Deyongsha one after another, and stepped down to low prices of 233 yuan and 237 yuan. It was supported after No. 218 and others replenished it. No. 157 and others also entered the current Yongsha, and some of those who were confused by the banknote rumors made some compensation. Near noon, Yongsha once rebounded to a price of 238 yuan and 243 yuan, and then closed at a price of 237 yuan and 242 yuan. After closing, the asking price was slightly lower. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Yonggong, Zhongfa, and half of the spot stocks fell, Yongsha, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing slightly fell, Xinhua, Xinhe, and Jinglun remained flat, Meiya, Liannei, and Neiyi slightly rose, and Zhabei, Rongfeng, Zhongsi, Match, and Xinya slightly fell. Hua Feng and Yongsha were flat for deferred delivery, and Xinguang, Xinhe, Meiya, and Jingfu slightly decreased.

Afternoon

A little stability was seen at the opening of the session. After the opening of Deyongsha, No. 23 and others successively closed from 244 yuan. Retail investors and the surface vigorously suppressed it, and stepped down to low prices of 234 yuan and 236 yuan. No. 97 and others still paid it, and rose to 239 yuan. However, the money market was still tight after the National Bank's exchange difference, and No. 32 still had a conclusion. Yongye was lowered by No. 191 to the limit down, and then retreated to 236 yuan. Under the maintenance of No. 76 and No. 116, Yongsha closed at 236 yuan and 238 yuan. The asking price after closing was tired. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Yongsha, Xinhe, Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, Xinhua, Zhabei, Zhongsi, Jinglun, and Anhui fell, Yonggong and Zhongfa slightly rose, Yongye fell to the limit, and Xinya, Xinguang, and Huafeng were still flat. For deferred delivery, Yongsha, Xinhe, Yanya, Xinguang, and Jingfu slightly fell, and Huafeng was still flat. The old stocks Dasheng and Cultural stocks continued to decline off-market, and the rest were still stable.

### National Bank Enters, Tight Money Market

[Our Report] The National Bank Bureau continued to enter 30.9 billion yuan in the bill exchange yesterday, and also entered 51.2 billion yuan on Monday, so the money market was tight again, and the dark interest rate was called up to 1 jiao 9 fen, and the off-market interest rate for Chinese stocks was also raised to 2 jiao 5 and a half fen. Yesterday, the Central Bank entered 31.1 billion yuan, the direct exchange line Zhuang entered 13 billion yuan, the foreign bank entered 15.2 billion yuan, and the agent exchange line Zhuang entered 59.1 billion yuan.

### National Bank Handles Current Deposits

[Our Report] In order to facilitate the use of funds by commercial banks, the Central Bank has specially set up interbank time deposits in addition to interbank current deposits for regulation. The regulations stipulate that 500 million yuan is a unit, with a period of 10 days, and the interest rate is 5%, which is higher than that of current deposits. In addition, if the deposit line Zhuang needs funds within the period, it can still add 2 fen to the deposit and mortgage it to the National Bank. Therefore, commercial line Zhuang is convenient. It is heard that since August 20, there has been a very enthusiastic rush to the National Bank to handle this deposit, with a total amount of more than 100 billion yuan, which is beneficial to absorbing market funds and stabilizing prices. In addition, it is also heard that in addition to commercial banks, national bank bureaus that have not applied to the National Bank for re-mortgage or discounted payments can also obtain the convenience of interbank time deposits.

### Loan Committee Approves Industrial Loan of 4 Billion Yuan

[Our Report] The 23rd regular meeting of the Discount Committee of the Central Bank was held at 4 PM on September 16 in the conference room of the committee. Members such as Qin Runqing and others attended, chaired by Qin Runxiang. The meeting approved 14 industrial loan cases reviewed by the 23rd Industrial Review Committee, with a total amount of 4.04 billion yuan.

### Suppressing the Market Price of Gauze: Adopting a System of Rewarding Secret Reports; the Quota for Gauze Transported South Increased by Fifty Percent

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee's eleventh committee meeting was held yesterday, starting at 4:00 PM. Resolutions: (1) Recently, the market price of gauze has seen a significant rise, raising concerns that unscrupulous merchants are accumulating and manipulating prices. To strengthen control, a system of rewarding secret reports will be adopted. If non-industry individuals are found to be dealing in gauze, or industry insiders are confirmed to be hoarding and manipulating prices, the gauze will be recovered at the previously agreed price. Those who provide secret reports will be rewarded. This measure is expected to be submitted for discussion at the next Municipal Government Economic Conference and then implemented by the committee's gauze group.

(2) To thoroughly suppress the rising price of cotton, a survey will be conducted of the latest cotton stock levels of various cotton firms and yarn factories in the city, to facilitate control.

(3) The quantity of gauze transported south will be increased by fifty percent from this month onwards, based on the original quantity. The control of gauze transported north will be completely lifted after the committee's Tianjin office is established.

(4) The agreed price for cotton yarn will be based on the original agreement, adopting a flexible approach to stabilize market prices.

### Gauze Market Downstream

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation saw prices decline due to ample supply and continued tightness in the money market. There was considerable reselling of cotton cloth within the market, with many manufacturers selling off their stock. Supply exceeded demand, also leading to a market decline.

### Immediate Use of Negotiable Instruments

Banking Industry Requests Temporary Maintenance of Existing Practices

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Banking and Commercial Association resolved yesterday: (1) Regarding the immediate use of negotiable instruments, a further submission will be made to the Ministry of Finance requesting that the existing practices be temporarily maintained. (2) Regarding the Ministry of Finance's imposition of a special business tax of four percent, a request will be submitted for a reduction. (3) The issue of liability for returned checks following a colleague's suspension from clearing should be definitively resolved; it was decided to conduct further careful study.

### Government Bonds Weaken, Foreign Stocks Mediocre

Government bonds weakened further yesterday. Retail absorption was unable to curb the selling pressure. Rooms 503 and 555 both sold, with turnover remaining at just over three million. Unified Series C opened at 12,300 yuan, then gradually fell to 10,500 yuan before slightly stabilizing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Series A and B fell by 900 yuan, Series C fell by 1,200 yuan alone, Series D fell by 800 yuan, and Series E fell slightly by 500 yuan.

There was not much change in foreign stocks yesterday. Supply and demand were mixed among securities firms, and individual stocks saw varied rises and falls. Hong Kong Shanghai Electric reached 12.3 yuan, but did not make significant progress. As a result, compared to the previous close, Hall & Holtz, Wing On, and Jardine Matheson saw slight declines, while British American Tobacco, Jardine, and Shipping saw small gains; other stocks were relatively stable.

### Overseas Chinese Merchants in Korea Urge Opening of Trade with Korea

Zhou Shenjiu, Chairman of the China-Korea Trade Association, and others recently jointly telegraphed Liu Weichang, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Dai, Acting Minister of the Overseas Department, urging the abolition of the ban on trade with Korea and the early restoration of normal relations, and proposed two suggestions for temporary commercial arrangements.

### Rayon Soars

The momentum of rayon remains strong, and prices continue to rise.

Zhang Chao first reported on a discussion with the Mayor regarding the proposed resumption of edible oil rationing. However, due to the significant implications of this matter, after discussion, it was decided that Zhang Chao would visit Mayor Wu at 3:00 PM today to seek solutions to the following points: (1) What name should be used for the resumed rationing? (2) What is the source of funding for the organization? (3) Which organization will supply the edible oil required for rationing? (4) Personnel arrangements, etc., must be decided before actively proceeding with the resumption of rationing.

Retailers Reluctant; Rice Market Slightly Weak

Yesterday, a total of over 12,700 piculs of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets. Retailers showed reluctance to stock up, mainly due to the high prices, making sales difficult. Many retailers were selling off their stock, causing the market to shift from firm to weak. Indica and japonica rice both saw declines ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 yuan, while early thin indica remained stable due to scarcity. The rationing of flour remained unchanged, and market activity was also relatively quiet, with no price fluctuations.

### Shanghai is Not an Easy Place to Establish Oneself: Reply to an Apprentice Seeking a Living in Shanghai - 효生君

효生君: After reading your long letter, we are very moved. There are indeed too many unreasonable things in the current society. There is a considerable number of young people in situations like yours. Your father's "emphasis on commerce and disregard for learning" in hastily deciding your future is indeed an unreasonable thing. It is naturally good that you have a strong desire for knowledge, and we express our admiration for your determination to continue your studies in order to achieve your future goals.

However, you should make a thorough consideration and a comprehensive plan beforehand. Your disregard for everything in coming to Shanghai is of course a courage that a young person should have, but this rash behavior often commits the mistake of "having courage but lacking strategy," which causes the entire plan to suffer setbacks.

Although there are many schools in Shanghai, tuition fees are set very high, and poor young people without money cannot enter. Things like "scholarships" and "loan scholarships" require excellent grade reports or certificates of guarantee in order to apply. Finding a job in Shanghai, where there is a surplus of people, is also a very difficult thing. You must wait patiently to obtain a suitable opportunity.

The cost of living in Shanghai is very high, and it is difficult to live without a fixed income. In our opinion, it is better to return to your home in Changshu, explain your aspirations to your father, and if he is a truly loving father, he will certainly understand you. Good luck! ·Editor· (Letter published in the 15th edition of this column)

### Bombing and Other Matters

— Shi Lang

Upon hearing that Japanese goods are of "poor quality," many Chinese manufacturers may "breathe a sigh of relief," believing that Japanese goods are not to be feared. In reality, Japanese goods have low costs. With their existing industrial base, and under the supervision of the American military, they will certainly be able to catch up to pre-war standards.

What about our products? Chinese manufacturers must consider this.

"A dancer pregnant and meeting the mayor" – this is naturally an extremely tragic thing. However, at the dancer's conference, the dancers only cried and said that there was only "one way to die," which is truly discouraging.

At this dancer's conference, the workers said a lot and proposed many solutions. Why didn't the dancers themselves say a few more words?

After "Frisbee," there is another "strange story" of "bombing London." In reality, at this time, these people hearing the "latest" in war news are being too hasty. Honestly, no one will provoke war at the moment. Humanity's nerves have not yet recovered from six or seven years of "destruction" and "death," let alone anything else!

The admissions lists for various universities have been successively announced. The whereabouts of those who failed are worth pondering.

I wonder if the education authorities have any investigations or statistics on them?

Hu Shi made a statement to our newspaper's reporter, advocating for increasing the number of national universities. We completely agree; however, there are too many illiterate people in China. Running universities well is indeed reasonable, but eradicating illiteracy should be carried out more widely. What does Dr. Hu Shi think?

### China and Siam

— Translated by Zheng Ming

The main problem of Siam is the conflict between the strong desire of the people of the country for autonomy and the European colonial powers who insist on guiding the fate of "backward" people and still try to maintain their pre-war position, making Siam a land where this conflict will continue indefinitely. But today, in Southeast Asia, Siam is the only country trying to break free from the shackles of foreign colonialism, which gives travelers who are familiar with Siam's situation a pleasant contrast.

However, this small kingdom also has its own post-war problems. Although Siam is formally independent, it is still subject to a certain degree of control by several major powers. For example, most of its foreign trade is now in the hands of the British. It is said that about 80 percent of its coal industry is controlled by British and Australian interests, while the major part of various other businesses in the country is also held in the hands of Chinese merchants. Siam's border disputes have never been resolved in a way that could satisfy Siam's demands, and have now led to strained relations with the French in Vietnam. When France had restored all the land claimed by Vietnam, the French accused the Siamese of supplying weapons to the Viet Minh government and facilitating their smuggling across the Vietnamese border.

Post-war inflation, a decrease in foreign exchange reserves, a lack of important foreign investment, and the government's apparent inefficiency have created many difficulties for the country. However, Siam's biggest simple problem is that the small number of Chinese expatriates may one day become a majority.

Before Japan's surrender, China and Siam had formal diplomatic relations. Siam was not very willing to have such diplomatic relations in the past, because she was afraid that a Chinese ambassador would inevitably become the official representative of an estimated three million to four million overseas Chinese in Siam. This number of three to four million overseas Chinese, which may account for one-fifth of Siam's total population, has always created a sharp minority problem. After the victory over Japan, China emerged as one of the victorious five powers, and Siam had no choice but to establish diplomatic relations with China. Bangkok and Nanjing exchanged ambassadors, while the Siamese government relied on various laws to restrict China's activities within its territory. Except for a certain riot in 1945, relations between the two countries were at least superficially calm and peaceful.

Due to their hard work and outstanding abilities, the overseas Chinese in Siam have occupied a dominant position in Siam's economy. Siamese people are generally farmers and rulers, while all trade and commerce are actually in the hands of the Chinese. Because the Chinese are becoming increasingly wealthy, Siamese farmers and workers are increasingly blaming the Chinese "middlemen" for the economic oppression and other difficulties they suffer. At the same time, the overseas Chinese feel that they are often publicly attacked, and naturally tend to seek protection from their motherland and demand more guarantees and privileges from Siam. It is clear that this situation is explosive. Only careful and moderate consideration of all issues by both parties can guarantee that the people of the two countries can live together peacefully side by side.

### Tomorrow's Oil

— Bai Shi

Pessimistic prophets are always saying that the world, especially the United States, is running out of oil. Recent developments, however, indicate that this fear is entirely "anxiety about the sky falling." First, before current reserves are exhausted, atomic energy will have already reduced the need for oil. Second, new factories established by the United States in Texas and Kansas will soon be able to produce millions of barrels of gasoline annually from underground "natural gas," and at a price that is as cheap as the gasoline that is now refined from petroleum. Third, "Mobil Company" of New Jersey has entered into a cooperative plan with the world's largest coal company – "Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal Company" – to engage in large-scale research and experiments in order to obtain an economically viable method of making gasoline from coal. Fourth, the world's first-class geologists have predicted that vast and boundless oil fields can be found in the shallow seas around the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Philippines (such as north of Kyushu Island in Japan). To date, these sources of oil near the land have hardly been touched. In the United States, only California and Louisiana have drilled for oil in the nearby seas. In fact, the oil reserves on the seabed are immeasurably larger than those on land; and with the progress of science and technology, the date of large-scale formal exploitation of them is not far away.

### From Shanghai to Japan

— Wu Huaqing

——One of the Records of a Trip to America

On the morning of August 24th, many cars, boxes, and people of all ages and genders gathered at the China Merchants Bureau's First Wharf. These people and goods were all preparing to enter the white General Gordon steamer that was docked at the pier.

The ship was scheduled to depart at 3:00 PM. The pier was crowded with people seeing off the passengers. As soon as the ship left the shore, they surged onto the floating deck like a tide, waving handkerchiefs, grass mats, or umbrellas, and inspired by the music from the loudspeaker, almost wanted to jump into the water to see them off. A Jewish group was seeing off their friend, holding up a large banner that said Bon Voyage and waving small blue and white flags. After the ship sailed, some of them jumped onto a small motorboat and chased after it, singing their Jewish cheer for a long time before returning. After the ship passed the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, the plant set off firecrackers to bid farewell to their colleagues who were going abroad.

The first night, a movie was shown on deck. Because I was extremely tired from the past few days, I fell asleep as soon as I hit the bed, regardless of whether the cabin was hot or not.

Among the passengers this time, more than 250 were self-funded students going abroad, and according to regulations, they all sat in third class, so they formed their own tribe. In addition to eating and sleeping, they could also enjoy the deck and lounge, so they also found it quite convenient and comfortable. On the evening of the 25th, the students held a plenary meeting, and statistics were taken on the distribution of each school. As a result, the largest number went to the University of Michigan. Everyone agreed that each school should be divided into small groups, and they could travel together after going ashore in San Francisco. In addition, a person in charge was elected to prepare for various activities such as doing plays, singing, giving speeches, dancing, playing bridge, and photography. In this way, they would naturally no longer feel lonely on this trip.

On the morning of the 26th, the ship sailed into the Seto Inland Sea of Japan. The mountains and ridges along the coast undulated, and there were scattered sailboats. At around 9:00 AM, it sailed into Kobe Harbor. The harbor has a semicircular long dike, with two lighthouses standing at each dike entrance. After entering the harbor, the loudspeaker immediately announced that photography was prohibited because Japan was under military control. The harbor project in Kobe was built on a considerable scale, extending out into the harbor surface in the shape of wolf teeth, increasing the length of the berths. All passengers were prohibited from going ashore, but seeing the tall buildings standing far away and the iron chimneys emitting black smoke, I couldn't help but feel infinite emotion. The wharf was entirely controlled by the US military. The loading and unloading of iron ladders used jeep cranes, and even correcting the position of the ladders was done with small jeeps, making the most of mechanization. The Japanese, seeing this, may not be able to resist being impressed. The ship set sail again at 11:00 AM.

### A Medley of Things in America

— Xu Ziyuan

Child Labor in America

We can assert categorically that there are no useless people in America. Even the old, weak, and disabled have special jobs to do. Munitions factories employ many blind people to work. They lead their police dogs from home to the factory. Blind people in China have no work to do and can only call out "Lady and Madam" on the side of the road. We have learned half a bottle of cool "humanism" from Europe and America to oppose child labor, but America is a genuine humanistic country that does not prohibit child labor with harsh laws. As long as the employer does not mistreat the child laborer, and the working hours and nature do not hinder the child's development, why should we, under the guise of "humanitarianism," cut off the child laborer's livelihood? There are many jobs in America suitable for children. One of them is delivering newspapers. Millions of children ride their bicycles to deliver newspapers before going to school every morning. Each newspaper is counted at five cents. The newspaper office gets three cents, and the newsboy gets two cents. Delivering fifty copies a day can earn one US dollar. The work takes no more than half an hour every morning, and it is convenient to deliver newspapers from home by bicycle to school without any trouble. The newspapers are delivered to the newsboy's home by the newspaper office's car. When it is time to harvest cotton and oranges, farmers publish large advertisements to recruit students to help pick cotton and oranges. In addition to providing food and lodging, they can earn US$7-8 per day. The government encourages "child labor service," which can at least free up adults to take on other more important jobs. If there were no child labor, a large part of the adult population would be forced to move from factories to rural villages, which would affect the output of the factories. The child labor system can cultivate children's independent spirit of self-reliance. American parents never give children pocket money. They rely entirely on their own efforts. Older children are employed in coffee shops as waiters and cleaners, and some are hired in homes to care for babies. All of this is based on the principle that it does not hinder their studies. Shining shoes is also a child's profession. It would be a waste of manpower to have adults do this kind of easy work. Americans never use children's labor to do work for nothing in the name of charity. Therefore, any campaigns to promote children to sell "paralysis disease stamps," "Aid China Movement paper flowers," and "anti-tuberculosis movement paper flowers" have material rewards. American customs are that obligations and rights go hand in hand. A father asks his son to polish his leather shoes and gives him a dime as an example. The son receives it without shame and expresses his thanks. In Chinese families, children do not take on household chores, but demand candy from their parents, as if it is a matter of course. This is indulgence and leniency. How can this be the way to educate children? American children usually set aside a percentage of their earnings during work periods to be managed by their parents to offset food and lodging expenses. In fact, the parents use it to buy them clothes and daily necessities. This not only cultivates children's responsibility, but also restrains their extravagance. Chinese children inherit their parents' wealth from an early age and do not know the difficulty of material resources. Therefore, profligate sons have become an Eastern specialty. Americans do not give inheritances to their children and grandchildren, so there is no family to ruin and no property to squander. (51)

Stubborn Cat A-Mi (29) by Zhang Leping

### Green Jade Table

— Hu Lu

——The people of Rongqing County cast and erected a stele for County Magistrate Meng.

Strong nations have made corruption a trend, how could it be only one county official? I hate the people erecting a stele, raising stones and crying out for injustice, dipping my brush in bloody filth, it is difficult to cleanse for eternity!

If we search out corrupt officials and inscribe the history of greed, countless "stele forests" could be counted! Moreover, turning a traitor into a virtuous official is easy—writing a longevity article in private, weeping in a tombstone epitaph, there will be talented people to mimic it!

Note: "Stele Forest" is the name of the place in Xi'an where steles are stored, named for the many steles. All the words in the last three sentences are words of flattery, especially after death, everything is to blame others.

### Seeking Justice for the Memory of He Yangling

— A Lament

"Jiang Jingguo of Southern Jiangxi, He Yangling of Western Zhejiang," were like comets in the political landscape of the Southeast during the War of Resistance. Who would have thought that the latter star would fall so soon!

Both men's political capabilities were strongly supported by higher authorities. One created a new atmosphere in the administrative circles of the rear, while the other struggled to maintain the most arduous situation in the later stages of the War of Resistance at the front.

My acquaintance with Mr. He Yangling began in the winter of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. At that time, Shaoxing had just fallen, and the people across the narrow strip of water were in a state of extreme panic. Although it was the end of the lunar year, families, both large and small, were already fleeing to the countryside for refuge. The roads were almost deserted, and at night, only a few street lamps cast a faint glow. He was the administrative commissioner of the Third District, and his office was located at the foot of Wolong Mountain in the urban area. In his small office, I discussed with him strategies for Shaoxing's self-defense. At that time, he had already established the Third District Political Work Team, calling upon the youth of Yue [Shaoxing] to rise up in resistance. The district political work team held two sessions, and during the political warfare against the Japanese puppets, a large group of young men and women shed a great deal of blood and sweat in Chayuan Town, in the coastal area.

Mr. He was very strict with himself. On New Year's Day of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], as Shaoxing society gradually deteriorated from stability, he wrote an article titled "My Ten Self-Admonishments," published in the local newspaper, to encourage himself and others. The song "Defend Greater Shaoxing" was also written by him, and he commissioned someone to compose the music. At that time, soldiers and civilians in the Third District, on the streets and in the alleys, would sing the song: "The devils are coming, the devils are coming, sons and daughters of Yue, quickly stand at the outpost of the Qiantang River..."

Mr. He came from a literary background. Even during the busy times of military and political affairs, he would still paint and compose poetry with Li Shengweng, Zhang Tianhan, and others on weekends. It was the same in Western Zhejiang, except that the famous scholars who accompanied him were Zhang Tianfang, Cao Tianfeng, Jiang Daxin, and others. His poetry followed the style of Huang Shangu and Han Tuizhi, revealing spirituality from simplicity and actively promoting national salvation consciousness. His calligraphy was close to the style of Yu Youren, and those who obtained it cherished it greatly.

In Western Zhejiang, he worked to strike at the Japanese puppets and assist the Allied forces. Although his work was not as flamboyant as it was in the Third District, it was calm, firm, and his command and planning were more flexible. After General Doolittle's first bombing of Tokyo, when his plane crashed in Yuqian, as well as the assistance given to Westerners from Shanghai who sought refuge inland, were all planned and supported by him. He was very physically strong. When he went to restaurants, he liked to eat large plates of fish and meat, devouring them voraciously. The small restaurants in the mountain villages were often thrown into a frenzy by his eating habits. His clothing was extremely poor. He wore the same set of grass-green twill military uniform for three or four years and refused to change it. He looked like a down-on-his-luck veteran. He wore riding boots without socks. Once, when visiting a friend, the host insisted that he take off his boots, putting him in an extremely awkward situation.

"Director He is willing to take responsibility, and it's really a pleasure to work under him," was the unanimous praise of many military and political cadres. When an employee left, he would always give them a sum of travel expenses and inquire earnestly about their new opportunities. The literary friends who associated with him were all assisted by him. He emptied his private purse, resulting in his current desolate state after death.

Before his death, he was the director of the Third Division of the Central Organization Department. He habitually walked to and from work and ate lunch in small restaurants. When the weather was hot in the middle and early part of last month, he became ill from eating watermelon. He didn't pay much attention to it at first, but later, due to financial constraints, he delayed treatment. In a short period of two or three days, his condition suddenly worsened, and he died unexpectedly. Currently, the education expenses for his children are being raised by friends in Zhejiang Province. The many slanderous words against him in the past can now be swept away.

The demise of this Hu Linyi-like political decision-maker in a chaotic world is undoubtedly a great loss of talent at the present time.
