### Chairman Receives Chiang Meng-lin and Others, Government Reorganization Actively Underway, Representatives of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Arrive in the Capital for Discussions

[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Chairman Chiang summoned Chiang Meng-lin at 9 AM on the 2nd, inquiring about various affairs of the Executive Yuan after Soong Tzu-wen's resignation.

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] Today, all New York morning and afternoon newspapers published the news of President Soong Tzu-wen's resignation and Chairman Chiang's concurrent position as Premier of the Executive Yuan on their front pages. However, as the news arrived on the weekend, most offices were already closed for holidays, making it impossible to immediately ascertain the reactions from all sides.

[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Following the simultaneous announcement of the increased quota list for the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans and the People's Political Council, along with the Chairman's concurrent leadership of the Executive Yuan, Lei Chen took the Jing-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) train to Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd. It is said that this is a manifestation of the government's determination to expedite the reorganization. Mr. Lei will conduct discussions in Shanghai with various parties regarding the next steps in the reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the National Government after the four institutions.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Secretary-General Lei Chen arrived in Shanghai from the capital yesterday morning (the 2nd). His purpose is to invite officials from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties to go to the capital and discuss further government reorganization with Chairman Chiang. After leaving the train, Mr. Lei visited the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties separately. Both parties expressed their agreement to go to the capital for discussions. The Youth Party immediately decided to send Mr. Zuo Shunsheng, while the Democratic Socialist Party also decided, after a meeting at 4 PM that afternoon, to have figures such as Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Tang Zhuxin, Feng Jinbai, Wan Renqian, and Lu Guangsheng participate. Furthermore, all the standing committee members of both parties stationed in the capital also attended the discussions. Mr. Lei and the representatives of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties are scheduled to take the train to the capital tonight (the 3rd).

[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] Following Soong Tzu-wen's resignation, Weng Wenhao, Chiang Meng-lin, and Yu Hongjun also submitted their resignations. It is understood that the central authorities intend to consider them after the government reorganization. Zhang Qun is said to be the most highly regarded candidate for the position of Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan. It is reported that when Mr. Soong submitted his resignation, the Chairman tried to persuade him to stay, but Mr. Soong expressed his willingness to be responsible outside the financial and economic aspects and to continue working hard for the country.

[Our Dispatch] Since Premier Soong's resignation, there have been many rumors in the market, even suggesting that the gold and price control policies would be abandoned. According to an observer who spoke to our reporter, although Mr. Soong has resigned, it should not affect the policies, as the emergency measures program was announced by Chairman Chiang himself. Moreover, the successor is a cautious and conservative person who is unlikely to make many changes during this extraordinary period.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Chairman of the Democratic League Zhang Lan, in his personal capacity, sent a letter to Chairman Chiang. It was previously brought to the capital by Mr. Luo Longji. It is now known that the letter was not submitted to the Chairman and was brought back to Shanghai by Ye Duyi the day before yesterday. According to Mr. Ye, the letter was about to be presented when the government urged the withdrawal of the CCP personnel and Premier Soong's resignation was approved, causing the situation to change. The content of the letter had become outdated, so he brought it back himself. It will be brought up for revision at today's (the 2nd) meeting. It is understood that the revised letter will more specifically state the Democratic League's attitude towards the current situation.

[Further Dispatch] Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League recently denied rumors that members of the Democratic League would be withdrawing to Hong Kong. It is said that some members of the Democratic League may go to Hong Kong, but it will not affect the work of the Democratic League in the country. The Democratic League's stance remains unchanged, and it will continue to strive for unification, peace, and democracy. He considered the news that he and Luo Longpeng were members of the Communist Party to be "malicious rumors."

### CCP Personnel Remaining in Shanghai Scheduled to Go to the Capital and Return to Yan'an, List Submitted to the Garrison Headquarters

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The list of personnel withdrawing from the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party was submitted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters at 4 PM yesterday, totaling 34 people: 17 from Zhou Enlai's residence at 107 Sinan Road and 17 from the Xinhua Daily office on Zhubaoshan Road. The list of five CCP staff members working at the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has not been submitted and will be handled separately. These personnel have agreed to travel to Beijing by train at 7 AM on the morning of the 5th, and together with the personnel from the CCP's Beijing liaison office, will return to Yan'an by US military plane on the 7th. Dong Biwu, his wife He Lianzhi, his son Dong Xisheng (2 years old), and Dong's follower Liu Guoan, etc., took the train to Beijing last night at 11 PM. It is reported that before his departure, Mr. Dong sent a letter to Commander Xuan Tiewu, making certain statements.

### Zhou Enlai Requests Postponement of Withdrawal Date

[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] The CCP Liaison Office in Beijing received a telegram from Zhou Enlai in Yan'an to Chairman Chiang on the 1st, hoping to extend the withdrawal period to the end of March. Wang Bingfu took the telegram to Wu Dingchang, the National Government's Chief of Civilian Affairs, on the morning of the 2nd. Failing to meet him, he left the letter at the National Government and then visited Shao Lizi to inform him of the intention. Wang then visited Zhang Qun, but failed to meet him. The reason for visiting Zhang was that the CCP personnel in Chongqing numbered over 200, but the US planes could only accommodate 100 people, so he specifically visited Mr. Zhang to ask for a solution. On the evening of the 2nd, CCP spokesperson Mei Yi told reporters that the Beijing Liaison Office would return to Yan'an in its entirety only after the withdrawals from Shanghai and Chongqing were completed. Furthermore, 25 people from the Beijing Office returned to Yan'an by US plane at 9 AM on the 2nd. The US Embassy recently notified the CCP Beijing Office that the US could dispatch three C-47 aircraft to transport CCP Beijing Office personnel between the 2nd and the 7th. In addition, two large transport planes would be responsible for transporting Beijing Office personnel.

### US Statement on Transporting CCP Personnel

[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd] The US Embassy recently issued a written statement on the matter of transporting Communist personnel back to Yan'an, stating that it would be extended to complete between the 2nd and the 7th. The full text is as follows: "On February 6th of this year, the US government expressed its willingness to assist responsible Communist personnel in withdrawing to the Communist areas before March 5th. At the same time, it also helped government personnel withdraw to their original locations. As of February 21st, the CCP personnel of the Executive Headquarters had completely withdrawn to the Communist areas, and the government personnel had also reached their original locations. Only the withdrawal of CCP personnel from Chongqing, Shanghai, and Beijing has been delayed until now because neither the government nor the CCP could formally express their hope on this matter. On the 26th and 28th, the CCP finally submitted an application for the withdrawal of 167 people from Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. The US has now scheduled the departure dates based on the application. This transportation work must last until the 7th due to weather and other technical limitations."

### CCP Personnel in Sichuan and Kangding Ordered to Concentrate and Withdraw by a Deadline

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 1st] A spokesperson for the Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Headquarters told reporters that the CCP staff in the counties and cities of the Sichuan and Kangding provinces under the headquarters' jurisdiction have been ordered to concentrate and withdraw entirely by March 9th. It is hoped that the CCP staff in various places will voluntarily register with the county governments so that they can be properly protected and transported to their requested destinations. If they do not comply, the county and city governments will not be responsible for their protection. The Chengdu Garrison Command, believing that the Chengdu office of the Xinhua Daily uses the distribution of newspapers and periodicals as a pretext, often has a small number of unnecessary personnel staying in the urban area, affecting public security. It has recently sent a letter to the office, hoping that the CCP's overt and covert staff in Chengdu will be registered and sent to the office's dormitory at No. 3 Xin San Road, Dongcheng Geng Street, by March 4th. They will be completely withdrawn by March 5th, and the command will send troops to escort them to Baoji for transfer to Yan'an.

### The So-Called Anti-Liaison Incident Was Manufactured by the Communist Party, Incriminating Documents Seized in Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The so-called "Anti-Liaison" incident was a Communist conspiracy to instigate, as proven by the Communist documents obtained. First, the notebook of Chen Yuwen, the Chief of General Affairs of the CCP Sichuan Provincial Committee, stated that on January 20th, Wu Wangzhang personally paid 50,000 for student instigation, 40,000 on February 9th, and 340,000 for printing propaganda for students.

After a conflict with the local people, the party decided to: (1) expand propaganda, mobilize the masses, (2) entertain reporters, and (3) prepare petitions and comfort. After the propaganda team had another fight at Fuzichi on February 8th, the party decided to: (1) launch a mass petition, (2) send people to various schools to instigate strikes. On February 10th, it was decided to: (1) have major schools such as Yucai Society strike, (2) telegraph Zhou Enlai to ask for mobilization of a response in Beijing and Shanghai.

### National Army Advances on Changji Line, Du Yuming Flies to Changchun, 20,000 Communist Troops Attacking Dehui Annihilated

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] Director Du Yuming arrived here by special plane from Shenyang at 3:50 PM today. This is his second visit to Changchun since June 12th last year. Many of his senior staff members arrived here by special train a day earlier, proving that Mr. Du will stay in Changchun for quite some time to personally command the front-line military. Du was surrounded by dozens of reporters at his official residence, asking him to make a statement. He said: He is not good at this. A reporter asked, "When can we go to Dehui for inspection?" He said: "Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow!" Du believes that the goal of the Communist army's all-out attack this time is Changchun, and judges that the main force of the Communist army is now in the triangular area between Dehui and Jiutai. He said: More than 1,000 Communist troops once carried a large amount of explosives to Kaiyuan, attempting to destroy the Changshen railway line, but failed. Communist troops also tried to invade HuaiDe north of Siping and were repelled. Communist troops in Andong also harassed the Jishen line, and the Liuhe station east of Meihekou is still occupied by the Communist army. These activities are all to respond to the war in the Jichang area. Du also said that two divisions of the Communist army had planned to cross the Anshen line to invade Dashiqiao but had been intercepted. He also said that he would return to Shenyang after the front-line war came to an end and would go to the front-line for inspection in the next few days.

[Further Telegram] As of 12:00 noon today, the progress of the National Army on the front lines is as follows: (1) The vanguard of the National Army on the main Changha line has reached Sanmajia, 43 kilometers north of Changchun (10 kilometers north of Shazi Station); (2) The National Army on the left flank Changtao line has advanced to Majia Wopu, 35 kilometers northwest of Changchun (north of Wanbaoshan); (3) The National Army on the right flank Jichang line has advanced to the vicinity of Longjiabao, 35 kilometers east of Changchun. The Communist troops on each line were fleeing in disarray without effective resistance. It is expected that fierce battles may occur on the Changha line tonight.

[Further Telegram] The National Army on the main Changha line crossed the Buhai Station (62 kilometers north of Changchun, only 18 kilometers from Dehui) after noon today. It is expected to join forces with the defenders of Dehui tonight or tomorrow morning. The Jichang line eastern advance National Army, after breaking the weak resistance of the Communist troops in Longjiabao, the vanguard has advanced to the Yinma River, only 10 kilometers from Jiutai County. The National Army on the Changtao line marched into Nongan, 62 kilometers from Changchun, at 8 AM this morning and continued to advance. It can be seen that the main force of the Communist troops did not make any organized resistance and collapsed. According to the aerial reconnaissance report today: a large number of Communist troops on the Changha and Jichang lines fled in the northeast direction.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 2nd] Reporters recently learned from the military that the Communist troops besieging Dehui began to attack the National Army in the city from the 26th of last month, constantly increasing their troops, until yesterday when it turned into a fierce battle. At 8:30 yesterday morning, the Communist troops, with four divisions, made a desperate attempt to break into the Liudao Street area of Dehui. The National Army relied on fortifications to calmly fight back. After dusk, the Communist troops were all annihilated except for a few who escaped. In total, about 20,000 people were annihilated. In addition, more than 600 people were captured. The captured military supplies are being inventoried. It is said that the Communist troops surrounding Dehui include the 1st, 5th, 37th, 48th, 18th, and 9th divisions, a total of six divisions, plus three artillery regiments, with more than 100 large and small artillery pieces, in addition to 30 tanks.

It will also unite with various institutions and organizations to form a comfort delegation to the front lines to support the troops.

### Japan Resumes Foreign Trade 16 Months After Surrender, Allied Headquarters Tells Our Press Corps

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Sixteen months after Japan's surrender, it has quickly resumed foreign trade under the supervision of Allied Headquarters. Allied Headquarters officials told the Chinese press corps in Japan today that Japan has trade relations with the following places: China, the United States, Hong Kong, India, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Japan's main exports are textiles. Japan's pre-war number of spindles was 13 million tons, of which 2.5 million were used. 80% of textile exports are to earn foreign exchange. Japanese food and clothing rations are currently very low, with only five pounds of textiles per person per year. Japan's foreign trade is under the supervision of the headquarters, so any country that wants to obtain anything from Japan can contact the headquarters, and the headquarters can negotiate with the Japanese government. The headquarters obtains goods from the Japanese government and sells them to the relevant countries at world market prices in US dollars. The foreign exchange obtained in this way is not handed over to the Japanese government but is stored as the headquarters' trust funds. At the same time, the headquarters also purchases goods needed by Japan from the relevant countries and pays for them with the value of Japanese exports. Japan's main exports to China are mining wood, machinery, telephone poles, and phosphate rock. The ships going to and from China and Japan are Japanese ships. China was the first country to resume trade with Japan. As early as October 1945, the Chinese government consulted with the headquarters to trade with Japan on an exchange basis. The Central Trust Bureau is responsible for the Chinese side.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] US Eighth Army officials, when reviewing the situation of the Soviet Union's stationed occupation forces in Japan to the Chinese press corps in Japan this morning, told them that the list of Japanese materials for reparations has almost been completed. All countries that can receive reparations can visit some of the factories that supply reparations. Negotiations on the distribution of reparations to various countries are still underway in Washington. The commander of the US Eighth Army is 61-year-old Wenqierberg, who not only has military control over Japan but also economic control. Ai hosted a banquet for the Chinese press corps in Japan at his private residence this afternoon. Ai has visited China several times and knows a lot about Chinese history. He spoke about Beiping with excitement and said: "Beiping is the most beautiful city in the world." The basic tasks of the military government of the Eighth Army include: (1) promoting Japan's production to meet its peacetime needs, (2) supervising and controlling Japanese reparations goods, and developing the list of production. Currently, it is being hampered by a lack of raw materials (especially coal and food). Reporters asked if the Allied Headquarters would allow Japan to produce more than its domestic needs, thereby affecting our country's industry? He replied: The Allied Headquarters must give proper consideration to this aspect.

### Press Corps Very Busy with Receptions, Receiving Wine Non-Stop

### Xu Siping Talks About Inspection Impressions: Progress in Military Service in Southeast China; Deferred Conscription for Civil Servants, Students, etc. Under Consideration

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Director of the Military Service Bureau Xu Siping received reporters from this newspaper on the 2nd and talked about his impressions of the recent inspection of military service in various places in Southeast China, saying: I left Nanjing on January 4th. During these two months, I visited Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces for inspection. There are four main goals of this trip: (1) To inspect the implementation of military service in the new military service institutions. In general, the new military service institutions in various places in Southeast China are relatively reasonable and legal. Compared with the past, malpractices have been greatly reduced. (2) To explain military service laws and regulations so that local governments and people can understand the government's legislative intentions. (3) To inspect the organization and training of the National Guard in various places. (4) To urge various places to provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers who were wounded and disabled in the war. The impression of this trip is very good. The following are the feelings gained: (1) The general public's trust in military service personnel has improved. (2) After enlisting in the army, soldiers do not lack food and clothing, the desertion rate has decreased, and sick soldiers are also less than 1%. Although there is a phenomenon of substitution, the blame does not lie with the military service personnel, but with the people themselves. The most difficult thing at present is the insufficient number of barracks. This is the biggest defect. Xu also told reporters that it was originally planned to establish 60 division barracks nationwide, and 53 have been established. The rest will be established in order soon. When reporters asked when conscription would begin in Nanjing and Shanghai, Xu said that the above two places are still in preparation. The handling of household registration in Shanghai is better than in other places. The government is considering how to deal with the issue of deferred conscription for civil servants, students, workers, and shop assistants. However, military service values fairness. If the planned plans can be implemented, the whole country must "look to the right" within the year. The household registration in Taiwan is precise, but unfortunately 19 out of 10 people do not understand Mandarin. Whether conscription will be carried out within the year has not yet been determined.

### Working Together with One Heart and One Mind, Helping Each Other and Cooperating, Striving to Eliminate Construction Obstacles: Chiang (also Head of the Corps) Encourages Students of the Central Training Corps

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Spring Friendship Association of students staying in Nanjing from the Party and Government Class of the Central Training Corps was held at the corps in Xiaolingwei at 10:00 AM on the 1st. More than 2,000 students from various classes of the Party and Government Class attended. Deputy Head of the Corps Chen Cheng, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu, Lei Zhen, He Zhonghan, Chiang Ching-kuo, and others participated. Head of the Corps Chiang visited at 11:00 AM. After leading the salute, he gave an impromptu speech, saying: Comrades, for the past ten years, the purpose of your training in this corps has been to strive for victory in the War of Resistance and complete the cause of national construction. Now the War of Resistance has been won, but national construction has not yet succeeded. The heavy responsibility is still on our shoulders, and we must continue to work hard. Recalling the eight years of the War of Resistance, our officers and soldiers and compatriots across the country sacrificed countless lives and property to win victory. Our loyal, brave, and heroic War of Resistance made our Republic of China a model and pioneer in resisting violent aggression and defending the nation and race, and won the admiration of people all over the world. In theory, after the victory of the War of Resistance, our country should have been able to achieve a lofty international position in the world and promote our glorious history. However, everyone should look at how low our international position is today and how much the suffering of our people has deepened. People's admiration has turned into contempt, and our glory has turned into humiliation. Who caused this? It is very obvious that it is because after the victory, the unity of our country was destroyed. But why did someone dare to destroy the unity of the country? Why can't our country maintain the unity of the country? Today, everyone must ask themselves whether they have fulfilled their responsibilities. I believe that we revolutionary comrades demand all problems of me, if everyone can be diligent, then no one can hinder our revolutionary undertakings, our country will be able to unify the peaceful building. Do not say that we have more than 3 million revolutionary party members, everyone is working hard, everyone is united, will be able to complete the revolution, that is, the more than 20,000 students of the corps can unite and work hard, can complete the revolution. At today's memorial meeting of the corps after the victory in all capitals, I hope that all comrades will thoroughly reflect and self-examine. If there are places where we have not worked hard enough in the past, we must work doubly hard in the future. If there are places where we have not united enough in the past, we must strengthen our unity in the future. I believe that as long as we all work together with one heart and one mind, help each other and cooperate, the obstacles to national construction can be eliminated in one and a half years, so as to complete our rehabilitation work, lay the foundation for national construction, and the great cause of revolutionary national construction will surely succeed in our hands, so as not to live up to the mission of everyone in the corps.

Editorial

### Reading President Song's Report on Finance and Economy

In his report to the Legislative Yuan, President Song strongly emphasized that the current economic and financial ills are due to inflation. The reason for the inflation is that the Communists have wantonly sabotaged the country after the victory, and peace has not been restored. This is an ironclad fact. In this situation, to stop inflation, he believes that it is necessary to crack down on speculation on the one hand, and to try to restore the balance of payments on the other. This is also a necessary measure. However, speculation is not enough to increase inflation, but is the result of inflation. Therefore, to truly curb this inflationary trend, in addition to eliminating the rebellion and restoring peace, the only proper way is to balance income and expenditure.

How can we balance income and expenditure? According to Song's statement, and as stipulated in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the items are (1) rectifying tax revenue, (2) opening up new tax sources, (3) transferring state-owned enterprises, (4) continuing to sell enemy and puppet property and surplus materials, (5) public utilities being self-sufficient, and (6) stopping payment of any unnecessary or deferrable expenses.

With the exception of the second item, even if it is not for balancing income and expenditure, it should still be done. Currently, items three and five are being planned and implemented, and item four is a continuing undertaking. What the second item refers to seems too vague. It is said that a one-time property tax will be levied, but this may not be feasible in practice. This newspaper has already pointed this out, and Western newspapers have also expressed doubts. Therefore, the points that should be particularly noted and worked on at present are items one and six.

Song cited income tax as an example, believing that with serious rectification, an income of 800 billion yuan can be expected in the coming months. Income tax is a major source of tax revenue, and after serious rectification, its revenue will naturally be considerable. However, we believe that no matter what kind of tax revenue, if it can be seriously rectified, its revenue will definitely improve significantly. This is because the efficiency of tax administration is actually too poor now. Tax evasion, smuggling, and making false accounts are almost open secrets. Moreover, some unscrupulous officials inevitably engage in malfeasance, embezzlement, solicitation, and profiteering. As the saying goes: "The wool comes from the sheep's back." The more private interests are gained, the greater the public loss will naturally be. In order to speed up tax revenue, the Chairman once pointed out that "there is no need to pursue precise calculations to the point of prolonged delay, but rather to adopt rapid and effective collection methods." These words are naturally very correct. However, at the same time, if it is not supplemented by sound personnel management and clear rewards and punishments, then methods that are too strict will only lead to prolonged delays, while methods that are too lax will make it easier to manipulate things from top to bottom, allowing even large ships to slip through the net. Therefore, in rectifying tax revenue, we mainly advocate focusing on rectifying personnel management and discipline at the same time. As for the fundamental [blank], it lies in understanding the ability of taxpayers to bear the burden, reducing excessively high tax rates, and referring to their level of knowledge and habits to eliminate all excessively harsh procedures. As everyone knows, the motive for merchants and civilians to engage in smuggling, tax evasion, making false accounts, and colluding with unscrupulous officials is nothing more than to reduce the burden and seek self-preservation, not necessarily to willingly break the law. Complying with people's feelings will naturally make orders flow like water. Recently, I heard about such an incident: a certain bureau sent personnel to distribute tax forms to each household, asking them to fill them out by the deadline. Because the content was too complicated, most recipients could not fill them out and had to ask the personnel for guidance. Who knew that the personnel also did not understand and made various excuses, leading to disputes. Just imagine: if the people responsible for handling the matter do not understand, how can they ask people to comply by the deadline? If those who want to comply cannot start, how can tax revenue surge?

As for stopping the payment of unnecessary or deferrable expenses, this is naturally something that everyone agrees with. However, to implement this proposition, there are also two preconditions that must be met. First, whether it is the central or local government, the highest competent authority must be in charge of this matter and resolve it from a political perspective. If it is completely left to the disbursement or accounting departments to decide, I am afraid that they [blank] this power and it will not be easy to reach a moderate and appropriate decision. If the departments receiving funds are allowed to state their reasons, then even building public toilets [blank] and public cafeterias will have their legitimate and necessary reasons. The reason why expenditures are so huge now and the budget cannot be [blank] made is because the highest competent authorities all want to be good people and are unwilling to examine the situation and approve or reject things impartially.

Second, it is necessary to start by abolishing all unnecessary and deferrable undertakings. The expenses of various institutions can be roughly divided into administrative expenses and operating expenses, and administrative expenses come from operating the undertakings. Therefore, to stop the payment of their expenses, one should first stop the operation of the undertakings. Otherwise, if the operating expenses are stopped and only the administrative expenses are paid, everyone will be sitting around all day doing nothing. Is this administrative expense not equivalent to wasting money? Or, if only the operating expenses are paid and the administrative expenses are stopped, how will these operating expenses be used? The above two items will not only cause such phenomena when the entire sum is stopped, but even if a portion is simply reduced, it will greatly frustrate the institution and the undertaking. Therefore, to truly save these unnecessary and deferrable expenses, one must boldly stop these unnecessary and deferrable undertakings first.

### Mourning Mr. Powell

Yesterday, news came from Washington that Mr. Powell, a friend of China, suddenly passed away on the 28th of last month! Especially when he was loudly appealing to American people to pay attention to the allied country of China, he closed his eyes immediately after finishing his speech. Whether they knew him or not, all Chinese people, upon hearing the sad news of the death of this friend, expressed their deep sorrow.

Mr. Powell came to China in 1917 and published the "Millard's Review of the Far East" in Shanghai. Relying on his strong pen, he called for justice and for the freedom and prosperity of China. Anyone who has read his works deeply admires his clear understanding of China. Only someone like Mr. Powell can be called an expert on Chinese affairs. Compared with those reporters who come to China for a cursory look and then talk nonsense, the difference cannot be calculated here. Mr. Powell has been in China for nearly 25 years, and almost all of his most valuable time has been spent in China. China can truly be said to be his second [blank] country.

What we will never forget about Mr. Powell is that, for the sake of justice and China, he was envied by the Japanese, who regarded him as the number one anti-Japanese element and always wanted to put him to death. Before the Pearl Harbor Incident, Mr. Powell was still in Shanghai, fighting against the evil forces. Any text he published was banned by the Japanese. At that time, Japanese agents followed him at all times, using threats and temptations, using all possible means, but Mr. Powell seemed to be a pillar in the midstream, standing firm. Later, the puppet organization in Nanjing even issued an arrest warrant, but he remained unchanged. Such integrity is truly rare. But soon, the Pacific War finally broke out, and Mr. Powell was arrested by the Japanese military police. He was subjected to torture by the Japanese military police, and his legs were the most severely injured. It was not until 1942 that he was sent back to his country and treated in the hospital until now, but his legs have remained half paralyzed.

Last year, during the Tokyo trial of Japanese war criminals, Mr. Powell, despite his disability, still traveled to Tokyo to testify. After returning to his country, his health was even worse than before. But no one expected him to die suddenly. How can we not mourn the loss of a good friend when the sad news comes!

American scholars and celebrities who study Far Eastern issues often only know one thing and not the other, and even only use the perspective of Western society to evaluate the progress of reform in ancient Eastern countries, so they often publish some seemingly correct but actually wrong remarks, which make us laugh or cry. But this friend of China has such a clear and deep understanding of the Far Eastern situation and Chinese issues that any opinion he expresses is not something that those who do not understand the truth of the Far East and the dynamics of Chinese society can say. In December last year, American public opinion on Chinese issues was complex and bizarre. Even Dean Acheson, the director of the Far Eastern Affairs Office of the State Department, had once issued an admonition to Americans not to invest in China. At that time, Mr. Powell heard this fallacy and mobilized righteous Americans to jointly write to President Truman to express their serious concern. We are not being selfish, but Mr. Powell's righteous words are indeed worthy of our eternal remembrance.

In short, Mr. Powell's life seems to have been lived for serving China, and he has given us countless contributions. After hearing the sad news of his death, our sincerity cannot be fully expressed merely by mourning the passing of an ordinary colleague. We silently pray for the peace of Mr. Powell's soul! We especially silently wish for the democratic progress of China, so as not to fail Mr. Powell's expectations!

### Preventing the Greek Communist Party from Overthrowing the Government - British Troops Should Remain in Greece - The US Requests This Point from the UK and Promises Economic Aid

[United Press, Washington, 1st] According to reliable sources today, the United States has requested that Britain continue to station troops in Greece and agreed to provide economic assistance in order to prevent a civil war sufficient to turn back the Greek government and prevent the Communist Party from opening the door to the Near East. The United States also assured Britain that the United States is immediately considering taking over most of the economic burden in Greece, as Britain can no longer bear it. The United States also promised that this economic assistance will be implemented soon. Undersecretary of State Acheson delivered a note to the British Ambassador to the United States, Inverchapel, this morning. Although the content of the note has not been disclosed, it is known that it is about providing rapid military assistance and some military assistance not including troops. The so-called some military assistance is understood to be rifles, other military equipment, or surplus military materials, etc., but the United States has no intention of sending troops. The US note is a response to a note previously sent by Britain to the United States, which stated that Britain was unable to continue its military and economic assistance to Greece after March 31 due to the seriousness of its domestic situation. President Truman held a secret meeting at the White House on February 27. Forty-eight hours later, the United States sent out this note. According to British sources, they are very satisfied with the US reply. They also requested that assistance to Greece be implemented before Secretary of State Marshall goes to Moscow to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference on March 10. Some US congressmen advocated taking immediate action. Democratic Congressman Bloom also said, "We must help these people."

[This newspaper] London, 2nd broadcast: A British Foreign Office spokesman recently said that the United Kingdom and the United States are currently discussing in Washington the issue of the United Kingdom continuing to provide Greece with economic and military support. It is said that one of the issues discussed is the continued provision of foreign exchange to Greece so that it can purchase arms. It is also said that the United States will not send troops to Greece after the withdrawal of British troops from Greece. According to official sources, Foreign Secretary Bevin is planning to withdraw the last batch of 10,000 British troops from Greece within three months.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 1st] Well-informed sources recently said that British policy in Greece has completely changed in the past few weeks. British military advisers, who previously advocated a moderate approach to the guerrillas, have now reversed their usual practice and are all encouraging the Greek government to take strict action and are providing the Greek government forces with weapons. At the same time, British economic experts are also advising the Greek government to find ways to obtain US economic assistance. The main reasons for the change in British policy are no more than three, namely: (1) Greece cannot continue to struggle in its current economic difficulties without endangering its social organization; (2) The United Kingdom is unable to improve its own economic panic and is unable to assist Greece; (3) The United Kingdom is deeply afraid that the current internal strife in Greece will continue unabated and will cause Greece to fall into the Eastern European bloc.

The Nature of the Greek Problem is Significant

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] Washington commentators believe that the situation caused by Britain's memorandum on the Greek problem is more serious than a general world crisis. Britain's request seems to imply that the country's various military and economic obligations in the Mediterranean should be transferred to the United States. Observers here believe that this is the most serious problem in American history. If the United States does not fill this gap when British troops withdraw from Greece, and causes a crisis between the United States and the Soviet Union, it will either allow the Soviet Union to fill this gap alone and endanger the balance of power in Europe and the world, or both. A Washington newspaper predicted that the reactions that could occur when Britain withdrew from Greece were: (1) the establishment of a communist government in Greece; (2) Turkey accepts the Soviet Union's request for joint control of the Dardanelles Strait; (3) Soviet power spreads throughout the Arab world.

### Anglo-French Alliance Signed - Foreign Ministers of the Two Countries to Deliver Speeches - Belgium Expected to Join Military Equipment Standardization Agreement

[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in a speech in Littleport, Cambridgeshire, last night that the United Kingdom and France will sign an alliance treaty in Dunkirk, which is enough to symbolize the two countries rising again from the dark ages of 1940 and restoring our position in handling world politics. In addition, newspapers here today expressed their sincere welcome to the signing of the alliance treaty between the United Kingdom and France, which is in harmony with the warm welcome in the House of Commons.

[Reuters, Beijing, 1st] A Belgian Ministry of Defense spokesman said that when Belgian Defense Minister Defreuder visits London next week, he will discuss with British authorities the expansion of the Anglo-American, American-Canadian, and weapons equipment standardization agreements to Belgium. It is said that this move was initiated by the British side.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] Well-informed sources here recently said that the Belgian government is considering concluding an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union first, and then concluding an alliance treaty with the United Kingdom, following the same policy as the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty and the Anglo-French alliance treaty. The Belgian government may soon request to begin negotiations with the United Kingdom, but in order to avoid suspicion of organizing a Western bloc, Belgium may first try to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union.

### Eden Calls for Understanding Between East and West

[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech last night at a meeting of the United Nations Association here, stating that if we want to seek lasting peace, the West and the East must understand each other. The allied governments in exile in London during the war had decided that after the trials of war, a true spirit of steadfast tolerance and understanding must be produced. Our planet has shrunk. Today, we are closer to San Francisco than we were to Basra a hundred years ago. We are so interdependent that we have to cooperate closely, whether we like it or not. Can we learn this lesson of interdependence? If we can, the standard of material prosperity will be limitless, and human happiness will reach its peak. If not, the wars of the future, coupled with the terror of modern weapons, may determine the fate of mankind, and we must choose.

### Montgomery Returns to England After Holiday

[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] British Chief of the General Staff of the Army, Field Marshal Montgomery, flew to Folkestone, Kent, this afternoon from Switzerland, and immediately took a car [blank] back to London. It is said that I felt very happy after spending my holiday in Switzerland and will be able to do my best for important work in the future.

### Prussia Ceases to Exist

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] The Berlin Allied Control Council today promulgated Ordinance No. 46, announcing that the state of Prussia, the birthplace of German militarism, has in fact ceased to exist. Its land, which is currently under the jurisdiction of the Allied Control Council, will be divided into other high-ranking states or merged into other states. The central government of Prussia and its affiliated institutions will also be abolished at the same time. The law was signed by four representatives and came into effect on February 25.

### Inside Story of Nazi Underground Organization: Plotting to Kill Humans and Livestock with Bacteria, and Intending to Destroy Crops

[Reuters, London, 1st] Mr. Paul Bauer, Secretary of the International European Affairs Committee and French scientist, stated: Anglo-American authorities in Germany recently arrested approximately 800 members of a Nazi underground organization. This organization possesses substantial funds in Switzerland and Argentina and is plotting to implement new plans, launching a horrific offensive against human civilization. They intend to spread diphtheria and typhoid bacteria, and to transmit oral and foot-and-mouth disease bacteria to livestock, thereby destroying crops. We have a person fluent in German who participated in this Nazi secret organization. He informed us that this new type of secret weapon is being manufactured, and after production, it will be a powdery substance to be spread in public places and vehicles. The International European Affairs Research Society has distributed a seven-page report to the prime ministers and foreign ministers of Britain, France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, the United States, and the Soviet Union, revealing the following facts, urging all countries to pay due attention. It is stated that Axis funds overseas have not yet been transferred to the Allies or liquidated. There are still hundreds of German companies in Argentina, of which 60 have funds worth 9,000 yuan. The Argentine government has no guarantee of liquidating these funds. Before the collapse of Germany, a considerable amount of Nazi funds fled to Switzerland and are still controlled by German leaders residing in that country. Bauer also stated that even today, many Germans are fleeing to South America via Sweden, changing their names and joining Nazi secret organizations. Finally, he said: Before the next war breaks out, countries with fifth columns will inevitably discover covert terrorist activities that undermine public health.

### Secretary Marshall Leads Delegation to Moscow Tomorrow: Comprehensive Resolution of U.S.-Soviet Issues Pending

[United Press, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to travel to Moscow on the 4th to discuss various issues face-to-face with Soviet leaders. The U.S. delegation consists of 84 people, including more than 20 experts who are familiar with the following issues: (1) Resolution of the Soviet Union's Lend-Lease accounts, totaling $11.298 billion. (2) 95 ships that the United States transferred to the Soviet Union during the war, which the United States is requesting to be returned or compensated. (3) Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement, destroying the damaged German warships, including the uncompleted aircraft carrier "Graf Zeppelin," which was detained by Soviet forces in Stettin, and Moscow has acknowledged the delay in its destruction. (4) Distribution of confiscated Italian ships.

Conflicts of interest in the Far East do not seem to be on the agenda, as there are no Far East experts in the delegation. Disarmament and atomic control issues, as well as matters related to the United Nations organization, may be mentioned behind the scenes in Moscow. Secretary Marshall stated that whether he would discuss issues other than the German and Austrian peace treaties with Stalin and Molotov would depend on the circumstances, and that the Korean administrative issue would not be discussed. Based on the experience of previous meetings, diplomatic circles anticipate that the Moscow conference will last three to eight weeks, depending entirely on the extent of Soviet cooperation.

Turkey Concerned

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara] Turkish Prime Minister Peker told reporters yesterday that the Turkish government had recently exchanged views with several Allied governments regarding the upcoming Moscow conference, as it involves Turkey. The Prime Minister also stated that Turkey hopes to maintain friendly relations with all Arab countries, and Turkey hopes to obtain foreign loans.

### Situation in Palestine Worsens: British Army Club Bombed, Terrorists Active, Reaching Peak of Bloodshed

[Report from this newspaper] London, 2nd Broadcast: A violent explosion occurred in Jerusalem this afternoon, with heavy gunfire near the Jewish Agency headquarters. An alert was issued throughout the city, and traffic was cut off. This is the first time that riots have occurred on the Sabbath in the modern history of the Holy Land.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 1st] Palestine today seems to be rapidly heading towards complete military rule. The British army is actively searching for armed terrorist groups, who launched an attack that destroyed the British Army Officers' Club in Jerusalem, resulting in 16 deaths and 17 injuries. The British army claims to be in a state of alert. The government has imposed a curfew in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem and restricted residents in areas such as Dan, La, and Yafo from going out during curfew hours. British troops are patrolling the main streets of Jerusalem with armored cars and artillery vehicles, and troops are leaving the city to the north. Today is the bloodiest day in Palestine's terrorist period in nine months. Terrorists bombed the British Army Officers' Club in Jerusalem and attacked the British army camp near Naseriyah with artillery, killing one and wounding two. They also planted landmines on the camel road near Haifa, destroying a jeep, killing and wounding two each. A truck was also destroyed by a landmine near Der Kark, injuring one British soldier. The barracks near Keren Aona were also attacked, with unknown casualties. A shell exploded near Havat HaMizracha. According to police reports, a fire broke out at the water station in Ras al-Ein. The commander of the British forces in Palestine, Macmillan, went to the residence of High Commissioner Cunningham in an armored car tonight, presumably to hold an emergency meeting. According to an announcement by the Information Office, the government will issue an important announcement soon.

Jewish Terrorist Group Admits Unambiguously

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 1st] The Jewish terrorist group Irgun admitted today that they bombed the British Army Officers' Club in Jerusalem, stating that this action was in retaliation for the British army's expulsion of Jewish compatriots, and that no fortress is sufficient to protect the British.

### International Military Formation: United Nations Under Study

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] Regarding the organization of an international army to be controlled by United Nations agencies, according to reliable sources, the United Nations Military Staff Committee has completed its study of the principles of utilizing such forces and is now studying its organizational methods.

### World Bank

Policies and Goals May Change

[United Press, New York, 1st] Prominent economist Ms. Potter recently published an article in the "New York Post," predicting that domestic and international political trends in the United States will greatly change the policies and goals of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It is said that the American representatives of the bank will be completely replaced by bankers with commercial experience. The bank will become more commercialized and lack the ambition to assist the world in achieving economic stability, thereby promoting lasting peace. The role of the World Bank established by the Bretton Woods Agreement will be secondary in practical considerations. The changes in U.S. policy are due to the following factors: (1) The deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations. Although the Soviet Union is a signatory to the monetary agreement, it is not a member of the International Bank. As a result, several countries that were originally considered valuable borrowers by the United States are now within the Soviet sphere of influence and no longer have their value. (2) The main policies of the bank may be revised. It is now being considered that lending should be for commercial purposes, rather than for economic and political purposes. (3) Since the Republican Party's political victory last November, its criticism of the United States' entire foreign economic policy has intensified, and the International Bank is no exception.

### United Nations Associations Decide to Establish Office in China

[Central News Agency, London, 1st Special Dispatch] The Council of the World Federation of United Nations Associations today passed a proposal by the Chinese delegation to establish a Far East Regional Office in China. The Council appointed a special committee, including members from China, the United States, Belgium, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands, to study the plans for the Far East Regional Office. The U.S. delegation proposed raising funds in the United States to assist in the establishment of the regional office. The Council also resolved to send the Secretary-General of the Association, Mr. Ennals, to visit various countries in the Far East this summer for inspection. The Association will hold a large gathering at Albert Hall tonight, with speeches by several prominent figures, including Mr. Eden, Mr. Masaryk, and Mr. Cheng Zixiao.

### United Nations Administration of Japan: MacArthur Reportedly Submits Proposal

[United Press, Boston, 1st] Mr. Cunningham, editor of the Christian Science Monitor, wrote on the 1st that General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, will suggest that the administration of the occupation of Japan be transferred to the United Nations as soon as possible after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, as a test of collective security areas. It is said that when Mr. Cunningham recently visited Japan, MacArthur pre-informed him of this suggestion during a private meeting. MacArthur believes that the following two things are very necessary: (1) Proper military surveillance of Japan to ensure that it does not violate the various clauses in the peace treaty. To achieve this goal, the United Nations should establish an international police force sufficient to assume this surveillance duty. (2) Guidance, cultivation, and assistance in all technical problems for completing democracy. To achieve this goal, the United Nations should send international civil affairs experts to Japan.

The newspaper also quoted MacArthur as saying: "The problems of peace and war cannot be solved by military chatting tools, but must be solved by the awakening of the human spirit."

[China News Agency, Boston, 2nd] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower told a reporter yesterday that the United Nations' occupation of Japan can serve as a model for any future collective security mechanism. After the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan in the future, the occupation mission should continue, and the education in Japan will be democratized by the United Nations' civil affairs agencies.

### President Chiang Kai-shek Awards Medal to Mexican President

[United Press, Mexico City, 2nd] Chinese Ambassador to Mexico, Feng Chih-cheng, announced today that President Chiang Kai-shek has awarded the Special Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner to President Alemán.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] President Truman flew to Mexico at 8:00 this morning for his first visit. He will stop in Cranfield for one day to visit his 94-year-old mother, and will continue his journey on the 3rd.

### Clash Between Left and Right Factions During Korean Independence Day Celebration: Police Open Fire to Disperse, Many Killed and Wounded

[United Press, Seoul, 1st] U.S. military authorities announced today that eight people were killed during the celebration of Korean Independence Day in South Korea yesterday, four of whom died in Seoul. Approximately 100,000 people, sympathizing with the left and right factions respectively, held their own celebrations. On the way home, a conflict occurred in the center of the city. The police used force to disperse them, firing approximately 150 shots. Most of those who died were killed by police bullets, and two others were seriously injured and 79 were slightly injured.

### MacArthur Releases Report on the Governance of Korea

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] MacArthur's November report on the governance of Korea stated that commercial activity in South Korea is on the rise, but industrial production is still unable to develop rapidly due to a lack of raw materials and skilled labor. Political interest is focused on the election of the Korean Provisional Legislative Assembly. Due to improper elections, General Hodge has ordered re-elections in Seoul and South Gyeongsang Province. Several local riots have occurred, with several police officers and rioters killed.

### Korean Communists Counterfeit Japanese Currency: Finance Minister Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, Early Dispatch from United Press] MacArthur stated in his recent report on the occupation of Korea that Korean Communist Party leader and Minister of Finance Lee Kang-kuk counterfeited 12 million yen in Japanese currency in an attempt to disrupt the economy of the U.S. occupation zone, and has therefore been sentenced to life imprisonment. The Japanese currency counterfeited by the communists is equivalent to $800,000 at the current military exchange rate. MacArthur said: The communists' action reveals their purpose and attempt to disrupt the economy of South Korea. This 83-page report revealed in the financial section that the counterfeit currency was printed by a printing company, and three people from the company were sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 years imprisonment, respectively. Three printing workers were also sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.

### Powell's Remains to Be Transported to Hometown

President Chiang and President Truman Send Condolence Messages

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st Special Dispatch] After Powell's sudden death yesterday, condolence messages poured in from all sides. President Chiang Kai-shek, President Soong, and President Truman all sent messages of condolence to the Powell family. Before his death, Powell still urged the American people to pay attention to both China and Japan, mourning Powell's death. According to the wishes of his family, Powell's remains will be transported by train to his hometown of Hannibal, Missouri, on the 3rd, and the funeral will be held on the 5th. Powell has already enjoyed the reputation of "Brave Reporter of Asia," and his 61st birthday would have been in two months, but now he has suddenly passed away, bidding farewell to the world forever. Before his death, Powell sent a letter to the Washington Post, expressing that Congress should not repeat the mistakes of 1941, remaining indifferent to the evolution of the situation, so that in times of crisis, there is no preparedness. This is the last letter written by Powell.

### Soviet Union's New Invention: Needle-Shaped Microscope

[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] Two Soviet doctors and one optician have invented a needle-shaped microscope that can be inserted into muscles to observe internal structures, magnifying them 600 times. In addition, the Soviet Academy of Sciences of Tukraine has discovered a certain photosensitive body that can be used to manufacture instruments that enable the blind to read ordinary newspapers and books.

### American Senator's Witty Remarks: Demanding Annexation of Britain

[United Press, Washington, 1st] Democratic Senator Russell published a discussion on the 1st, informally inviting England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland to become the 49th, 50th, 51st, and 52nd states of the United States of America. Russell also stated that in any case, this merger method will be unavoidable in the next 40 to 50 years. Russell continued, "I think there is no other way to follow. This move will be beneficial to us. But we cannot merge them, we can only wait for them to request a merger. They are good people, and I welcome them very much. This move is more cost-effective than providing them with economic assistance. We have already lent them a sum of money, but when they have spent it in about a year, they will come to borrow again."

### Mount Etna Erupts in Sicily

[Reuters, Rome, 1st] Mount Etna in Sicily had three new fissures erupt yesterday, with lava flowing out. Several villages on the northern slopes have declared a state of emergency. The lava spewed from the old fissures has also increased in flow speed, causing significant losses.

### British Fleet Visits Lisbon

[Agence France-Presse, Lisbon, 2nd] The British Home Fleet arrived here yesterday for a formal visit. The fleet consists of eleven warships, including the battleship "Duke of York," which is the flagship of Admiral Sir Vian.

### U.S. Export-Import Bank: Significant Contributions to Post-War World Recovery

The year 1946 was a year of active American participation in stabilizing the post-war world. However, even if the massive efforts to restore the world economy after the war have made some headway, the tasks yet to be completed are still extremely arduous.

In these enormous reconstruction efforts, the United States bears a significant share. This effort is characterized by three features: First, the United States is the primary source of relief and construction goods needed worldwide; second, other countries are in poor condition, urgently needing supplies but unable to pay immediately, thus creating a significant financial problem; and third, the vast funds required for reconstruction pose a substantial repayment problem for the major creditor nations.

Regarding the first point, there is no doubt that the United States has the capacity to produce the goods needed for reconstruction. Therefore, despite having the significant task of domestic recovery, it exported goods worth 8.75 billion yuan between July 1945 and July 1946. Exports continue to increase, currently reaching an annual rate of 10 billion yuan, not including the 3.8 billion yuan from sold-off lend-lease and surplus materials.

Regarding the second point, the nature and approximate amount of the financial problem, the U.S. government foresaw this issue even before the victory over Japan. These expenses can be broadly divided into three categories: funds for relief, funds for long-term construction and development, and funds needed to balance the U.S. budget deficit.

As is commonly recognized, emergency relief for the poorest countries should be handled on a purely charitable basis. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was established for this international purpose, and the United States contributed a total of 2.7 billion yuan, or 70% of its total funding.

The Bretton Woods Agreement of July 1944 stipulated the establishment of the World Bank as a major post-war institution for providing foreign loans for long-term construction and development. However, due to delays in ratification, the World Bank's operations are only now beginning. The urgent needs after the occupation cannot be met by private capital alone. Therefore, to avoid a sharp decline in exports that would be detrimental to economic and social reconstruction, the United States is providing some credit loans until the World Bank can supply the funds needed for the emergency reconstruction of the war-torn world. To address this situation, the U.S. Congress amended the Export-Import Bank Act in 1945, increasing the bank's lending authority from 700 million to 3.5 billion yuan, removing the ban on lending to countries with unclear debts to the United States, and transferring the bank's management from a part-time board of trustees to a full-time, bipartisan board of directors.

The third feature of the reconstruction effort is the necessity of repaying long-term credit loans. This issue poses a thorny problem for the United States. If the United States hopes to have these loans repaid, its people must sooner or later face a situation of abundant imports.

To fulfill the mission stipulated in the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, the Export-Import Bank has committed loans totaling 2.65 billion yuan for general construction purposes. These credit loans include 655 million yuan originally required for purchasing goods under the lend-lease program, 1.277 billion yuan for emergency construction needs, and 13.3 million yuan for purchasing cotton. In the first category, France received 55 million yuan, Belgium received 55 million yuan, and the Netherlands received 50 million yuan, all for 30 years at an interest rate of 2 3/8%. The second category includes loans to Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, the Dutch East Indies, Norway, Poland, China, Abyssinia, and Saudi Arabia, ranging from 3 million yuan to Saudi Arabia to 650 million yuan to France. The terms range from two years for the Netherlands to mostly 25 to 30 years. The interest rate on long-term loans is mostly 3% per annum, with only a few exceptions. Cotton loans are mostly granted to European countries, but cotton loans to China also reached 33 million yuan. These loans have shorter terms, from 15 to 24 months, with an annual interest rate of 2%.

Later, due to demand exceeding supply, the Export-Import Bank had to adopt restrictions on emergency construction loans to meet the minimum urgent needs of borrowers. Therefore, the bank authorities carefully study all loan applications based on the urgency of the borrower's needs, the borrower's own financial resources, the possibility of obtaining loans from other sources, the borrower's ability to effectively use the loan, and the impact of the loan on the U.S. economy.

With the World Bank's lending operations about to begin soon, the period of emergency construction loans from the Export-Import Bank and the future plans of the Export-Import Bank are receiving much attention.

The fundamental purpose of the Export-Import Bank has been clearly defined by Congress as assisting "the financing of exports and imports and facilitating the exchange of commodities between the United States and any foreign country, or any agency or individual thereof." The bank has broad powers to handle general banking business and to make loans of any kind, provided that its exercise of power contributes to its fundamental purpose. It can lend to any borrower, and the amount is unlimited.

Since its establishment, the bank has always been prepared to assist U.S. exporters and importers under appropriate conditions. The usual method of assisting exporters is to lend to individual U.S. exporters, providing them with funds to purchase specific materials and equipment. After the end of the war, the number of exporters seeking credit loans from the Export-Import Bank that could not be obtained from other private banks gradually increased. The gradual relaxation of U.S. export controls and the increasing foreign demand for U.S. goods are the reasons for the significant expansion of the export industry. However, just as before the war, U.S. export sales are conducted under the following three conditions: the style of daily necessities, the ability of foreign buyers, and the competition from other suppliers. Since the credit loan period is longer than the time that commercial banks can generally accommodate, exporters are naturally happy to borrow from the Export-Import Bank. The bank has accepted all legitimate requests of this nature in the past and is determined to continue to do so in the future.

So far, the bank has not made any loans to importers. However, the main reason for this is not that the bank is unwilling to grant such credit loans, but that U.S. importers have ways to borrow considerable funds from commercial banks and other sources.

The Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank believes that increased imports are also an element of healthy and prosperous trade for the United States after the war. The bank has a special interest in this matter, because the bank's charter makes a special provision that the bank must have a reasonable assurance of repayment before granting a loan. At the same time, the Board of Directors believes that if the revival of world trade and the reconstruction of an effective multilateral trading system are successful, all countries that have received emergency construction loans will have no difficulty in repaying the loans.

At the same time, we believe that the greatest hope for the revival of world trade and the effective solution of the repayment problem lies in the reasonable expansion of U.S. imports. At the same time, if U.S. foreign loans cannot be extended indefinitely, the only way for borrowing countries to repay their debts and continue to purchase goods from the United States that are beneficial to them is through the U.S. import industry.

As the World Bank's early operations are about to begin, the issue of future construction and development loans from the Export-Import Bank has attracted much attention. In fact, when the U.S. foreign lending program was first conceived, the U.S. government had already foreseen that once the World Bank took over operations, the Export-Import Bank's long-term loans for construction and industrial development would definitely be greatly reduced. It has always been believed that the main institution for foreign construction and development loans should be the World Bank rather than the Export-Import Bank. The Export-Import Bank's policy is not to compete with the World Bank, but to fully cooperate with it. It believes that from now on, long-term construction and development loans should fall within the purview of the World Bank. However, this does not mean that the Export-Import Bank will no longer consider short-term construction and development loans to Latin American countries and other countries, nor does it mean that the Export-Import Bank will stop all emergency construction loans in the future.

The Export-Import Bank believes that under special circumstances, that is, certain countries that have been damaged by war are not members of the World Bank and therefore cannot apply for loans from the World Bank, some financial assistance from the Export-Import Bank may still be needed. However, the bank's funds are limited and not omnipotent. It can only provide emergency remedies until the basic problems of each country can be broadly resolved through other means.

### Fire Opposite Shanghai Grand Theater: Took Three Hours to Destroy Five Stores; Sick Woman Burned, Only Son Killed

[Reported by this newspaper] A paint store, Yongkang Paint Store, opposite the Shanghai Grand Theater on Avenue Edward VII (now Middle Yan'an Road) caught fire last night, lasting three hours and destroying five storefronts. The homeowner's wife, Yang Lou Shi, was injured, and her only son, Yang Zhigang, only seven years old, tragically died in the fire. The details are recorded below:

At 7:50 PM last night, this reporter was passing by the Taishan District Fire Brigade when I suddenly heard the fire alarm blaring. A fire engine sped out, followed by a pumping water team, moving with extreme agility. Unfortunately, the engine was too old and traveled slowly. This reporter heard a firefighter exclaim, "These vehicles should be thrown in the garbage!"

This reporter quickly followed the sound to the vicinity of the Shanghai Grand Theater. At that time, the old shop houses opposite the theater were already engulfed in flames. A pumper truck from the Taishan District was parked on the side road of the theater, drawing water to extinguish the fire. The firefighters were exceptionally brave, some standing in front of the windows, some perched atop telephone poles, and some climbing on the rooftops, using flashlights as guides to direct the flames. However, because the northwest wind was strong last night, the fire borrowed the wind's power, and the shop houses downwind quickly spread despite the pouring water, threatening to get out of control.

At the time, the fire scene was surrounded by onlookers. The electric lights next to the fire site were still on as usual. About half an hour later, the power lines were cut to avoid accidents. The fierce flames gradually died down after 9:00 PM, and the fire was completely extinguished around 10:00 PM. After the fire was extinguished, this reporter went to the scene to inspect. The houses in the area were old-style, one-story buildings. The residents were mostly middle- and lower-class, so in addition to building wooden sheds for shops outside the houses, they also built two-story lofts inside the houses, which is very easy to cause fires. The owner of the fire's origin, No. 1130, Yang Jinhua, from Chongming, was 38 years old. He was out when the fire broke out. Only his wife, Yang Lou Shi (31 years old), and son, Yang Zhigang, were lying on the second floor. Yang Lou Shi suffered serious injuries and had been moaning in bed for more than a month. Although she escaped from the fire, her only son, Zhigang, unfortunately died in the fire.

**Abandoning Her Son to Save Her Own Life, She Was Desolate and Heartbroken**

In addition to the total destruction of the Yongkang Paint Store, the neighboring stores that suffered were Nos. 1132, 1134, 1128, and 1126, including a pancake shop, a fried goods shop, and a beef shop. Except for Nos. 1130, 1132, and 1134, which were completely destroyed, the other two only had their lofts destroyed.

After learning that Yang Lou Shi, the owner of the paint store, was lying on the second floor of the Shanghai Grand Theater, this reporter went forward to interview her. Yang Lou Shi was lying on a sofa in the lobby of the second floor of the Shanghai Grand Theater, covered with a quilt, her face charred yellow. Her right hand, exposed outside the quilt, had been burned, and her legs were also seriously injured. This reporter asked her about the fire. She replied sadly: "When the fire broke out, the family was having dinner upstairs. Only I and my son were lying on the second-floor loft. The fire started downstairs. When my young son, Zhigang, noticed it, I struggled to get up. Although I wanted to hug my son and escape together, I was too weak and unable to pick him up, and the fire was gradually approaching. I had no choice but to abandon my son to save my own life, and the tragic cries of my son were still heard in the flames." Yang Lou Shi almost burst into tears as she spoke. She only had one son and one daughter. Now that her son had been burned to death, it was truly tragic. Yang Lou Shi was then helped by her relatives to the hospital for treatment. Yang Zhigang's body was also dug out by the firefighters, his body charred black, a terrible sight.

**Firefighters' Underwear Soaked with Water**

Last night, the fire brigades participating in the fire fighting included the Taishan District, Xinzha District, and Fahua District teams. A total of four fire engines arrived at the scene and put in a lot of effort to extinguish the fire. This reporter witnessed firefighter Gao Zhan standing on the cloud ladder and rescuing the fire for an hour. According to the Taishan District Captain Xu, all the firefighters who participated in the fire fighting had their underwear soaked. He himself was wearing a new suit to watch a soccer game and rushed back to the team after receiving the alarm, not having time to change clothes, resulting in a great loss. This reporter saw that although the leather hoses used by the fire brigade were broken, they were still usable, so the fire was quickly extinguished. After the fire was extinguished, a team of auxiliary police rushed to the scene. As for the cause of the fire, there are various rumors, some saying it started from a kerosene stove, and some saying it started from a broken electric wire. The police are currently investigating.

**Shacks Burned Down at the End of Gongping Road**

In the open space along the end of Gongping Road and Shaohong Road, there were many shacks built by the poor. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, due to careless cooking, a spark fell and the fire spread rapidly in an instant. Fortunately, the fire brigade received the news and arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire, resulting in the burning down of four shacks.

### Due to Material Difficulties, Cigarette Packaging No Longer Uses Tin Foil

Recently, after the government's regulations on foreign exchange settlement restrictions, the prices of cigarette packaging materials, such as the tin foil inside and the printed paper on the outer box, have skyrocketed and are not easy to purchase in large quantities, which has greatly affected the production of various factories. It is learned that the Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association, in view of this, convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures, and unanimously decided that all factories will temporarily stop using tin foil. For those that are sold to other cities and need moisture-proof packaging, they will use wax paper and domestic products instead. The above resolution has been notified to members by the association for compliance in order to reduce the burden on customers.

Wu Nanxuan, Wu Wei Nan, and 86 other faculty members and Su Changgeng and two other executive directors of the Student Self-Government Association of National Fudan University initiated the "Movement to Protect Rights" to oppose international intervention in China's internal affairs, as reported in previous news.

How can there be heartless and crazy people who sing the fallacy of international intervention and spread heresies, which makes people's hair stand on end? The comrades are indignant and have to refute it strictly. Therefore, based on conscience, we put forward the following five points. All Chinese people should rise up together to save the country from danger. (1) No foreign forces are allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs! (2) We swear not to allow the Yalta Conference to be repeated! (3) Any international conference must have China's participation! (4) Recover all lost territories!

### The Good Shepherd Convent Shelter for Destitute Girls Teaches Them Literacy and Skills to Become Good Working Women

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] There seem to be many relief organizations in Shanghai, but shelters for girls are rare. Among these few, the Good Shepherd Convent Shelter at 910 Route Tenant is one, and it is one of the better-equipped. It has been established for fourteen years, but few people outside know about it. In these difficult times, the nuns in the convent have to appeal for the sake of the one hundred and fifteen girls, and more in the future.

The girls sheltered by the Good Shepherd Convent Shelter range in age from eight or nine to twenty-one or twenty-two. They are sent by parents from poor families or by people from the church. Some children have unclear family backgrounds, and no one wants to take them in, and schools also refuse them. The kind nuns take on the responsibility of educating them. The convent does not want to take in girls who are too old, because they fear that their already-formed bad habits will easily influence the younger generation. At the same time, due to a lack of funds and few workers, they cannot temporarily take in infants. Their main goal is to cultivate a group of women who can read and do housework, so that they can become virtuous housewives or self-reliant working women in the future.

Choosing Spouses for Girls When They Grow Up

When the girls grow up, the nuns will choose a loyal and honest husband for them. They must first investigate whether the other party's parents-in-law can like their daughter-in-law. At the same time, because they are all Catholics, the people they marry are also Catholics.

The director of the shelter, Nun Frances, has served in the convent for twelve years. The girls under her guidance are all very capable. In their spare time, they learn knitting, embroidery, and lace-making. Because the production is not large, they cannot be officially sold yet. In addition to the director nun, there are nine American nuns, and one Chinese and one American nun are currently studying new methods of managing shelters at the Good Shepherd Convent in Los Angeles, and will soon return to China. In addition, there are five students from Qiming Girls' High School in the convent. They are enthusiastic about public welfare and voluntarily serve as teachers in the convent.

Funding Comes Entirely from Donations

In addition to the twelve students whose parents subsidize a portion of their tuition, the rest are homeless and helpless girls. The convent never forces them to leave. Many girls do not want to leave when they reach the age when they should get married, preferring to do more handicrafts inside. The nuns treat them like their own daughters. The funding for the shelter does not have a fixed source. In addition to the occasional generous donations from a few benevolent people from the church, Mayor Wu's wife donated two million yuan, and the General Relief Administration donated some flour and blankets. Usually, a nun goes to the streets to solicit donations from benevolent people. The children eat white steamed buns or yellow rice for each meal, and four people always share one dish. In the past, they often asked the American military service club for leftover cabbage, but now that source has also been cut off, and they have to buy it themselves. When the reporter finished the tour and said goodbye, the director nun sincerely and frankly said to the reporter: "We most hope that people can donate some food and some money for us to use to repair the house, because the house is old and often needs to be repaired, and the cost is conceivable!"

### Warmth Permeates Shanghai Prison as Inmates' Families Bring Food; Crowds of Men, Women, Old and Young Gather in Front of the Gate Two Days a Week; They Face Each Other in Silence for a Short Ten Minutes, Only Shedding Tears

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] High walls, heavy iron gates, narrow cages in individual squares, imprisoning active lives. This gray, huge building, Shanghai Prison, the spring breeze seems to never blow in. However, there are exceptions. On the days when meals are delivered to the prison on Tuesdays and Fridays, it can be considered a ray of warm spring breeze permeating the prison!

Only Vegetables Allowed, No Rice

At the break of dawn, the family members of the prisoners lined up in front of the small iron gate on the right hand side of Shanghai Prison, men and women, old and young, including no small number of family members of "high-ranking officials and wealthy people", fashionable modern girls holding food boxes in their hands. (It is usually said "delivering prison food", but in reality, only vegetables are allowed, not rice.) What are they sending? According to the prison's regulations, there are the following types: Food: Salted meat, salted fish, cooked fresh meat, cooked ham, pork floss, chicken floss, salted eggs, dried vegetables, seaweed, pickled mustard tuber, Chinese pickled cabbage, spring onion tops, pickles, dried snacks, sweets. Items: Soap, towels, toothpaste (powder), toothbrushes, shorts, single-layered shirts and trousers, sanitary shirts and trousers.

Delivery in Order of Number

Delivery of items is based on the delivery permit, and visitation is based on the visitation permit. Those who have not been sentenced by the High Court can only send items and cannot visit, to prevent collusion. Only the family members of those who have been sentenced can visit on time, line up to enter, and tie the food items in cloth bundles or mesh bags. The guards call out the numbers in order and hand over the food items to the guards. These delicacies prepared by the wives and daughters of the prisoners, like the spring breeze, permeate the solemn iron windows, giving the prisoners a little warmth and comfort. After the prisoners receive the food items, the empty food boxes are sent out by the guards, calling out the numbers, and the family members take them back. In this way, the work of "delivering prison food" is completed.

Where to Begin with a Thousand Words?

Visiting prisoners requires a visitation permit. The location for the conversation is the key room, and the conversation time is limited to ten minutes. In these short ten minutes, with a thousand words, one doesn't know where to begin. Some face each other in silence, only shedding tears. When the time is up, they walk out with a bag of tears, only to realize that the important words have not been said!

Some family members stare at the narrow cages in the distant high-rise buildings, and the prisoners also look out through the iron windows, expressing their feelings through various gestures when their eyes meet.

A Russian Woman Blows a Kiss

A Russian woman stares intently at her husband in the rehabilitation center and blows a kiss. Although separated by a high wall of law, their love still merges their spirits together. After 4:00 PM, the family members who "delivered prison food" returned with empty food boxes one by one. The gray high-rise buildings, the gray cement corridors, and the gray prisoners imprisoned in the narrow cages, returned to their gray silence.

### Wife of Drug Trafficking Ring Leader Swallows Gold Out of Fear of Punishment

### New Regulations for Housing Rental Ordinance? Subtenants Without Leases Require Written Consent from the Secondary Landlord

Regarding the housing rental ordinance, it is heard that the authorities have new regulations. For subtenants who have already moved in but do not have a lease, they must obtain written consent from the secondary landlord to be valid. A certain lawyer told a reporter that if this clause is applied to Shanghai in the future, it will cause panic. In this city's customs, the rental relationship between secondary landlords and subtenants is generally not based on written contracts. If the aforementioned regulations are implemented, then most secondary landlords will definitely not issue this written consent without demanding a new tip, and will even use it as a talisman to force subtenants to move out, solicit new tenants, and extort tips.

In order to increase the efficiency of postal delivery between Shanghai and Nanjing, the city's post office has set up five special mailboxes in the city area. In addition to the usual collection of letters during the day, a special person is assigned to collect them once every night at a specified time.

### Zhengda University Strike

— Our Correspondent in Jiangxi, Liu Zao

A Martial Drama with Flying Bricks - Principal Xiao's Head Was Injured!

"We want a president," "We want professors," "We want books"... These slogans have been constantly found at National Chung Cheng University. However, Principal Xiao has traveled to Chongqing and to Beijing and Shanghai to deal with this problem, but he has encountered many difficulties and has not been able to achieve the expected results.

Recently, Principal Xiao talked about the process of enriching the school's content at a student meeting. He knew that although he had overcome all kinds of difficulties and obtained some instruments, books, and professors, the school's internal resources were very poor. The only microscope available was borrowed, and the machines in the civil engineering department's practice factory were also borrowed from private sources. This caused the young students, who had a strong desire for knowledge, to bury their suffering in their hearts. Therefore, the calls for "We want a president," "We want professors,"... were deeply imprinted in the hearts of every Zhengda student.

Cai Fangyin, director of the Civil Engineering Department, had some unpleasant feelings with Principal Xiao due to three issues. The reasons were: (1) Professor Cai had a collection of structural mechanics books and signed a contract with the school in Taihe for standby use, but these valuable rare books were lost during the wartime relocation. Professor Cai had requested compensation from the school based on the contract. (2) Part of the machinery in the Civil Engineering Department's machine factory was Professor Cai's private property. He recently requested its return. (3) Professor Cai was one of the founders of Zhengda in Taihe and was also the dean of the College of Engineering. After Xiao took over as president, he reappointed Cai as the director and professor of the Civil Engineering Department. Cai is currently the director of the Industrial Technology Office of the Xingan General Branch, and his duties are busy. He has requested the president to grant him retirement in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, but the Ministry of Education believes that there is a shortage of professors and instructed Principal Xiao to express his condolences and persuade him to stay. Professor Cai had expressed his intention to resign due to the above reasons.

After learning of this news, the students of the Civil Engineering Department believed that the candidate for the dean of the College of Engineering had not been determined, and the director of the department was also about to resign, which was a huge crisis for everyone's academic future. Therefore, on the night of the 17th of this month, the students of the Civil Engineering Department marched in teams, shouting: "We want a president," "We want a department director," "We want professors," "Retain Dean Cai,"... The marching ranks arrived at the faculty and staff residential area, awakening Director Wu Shidong. Wu tried to dissuade them at the scene but failed. At about 10:00 a.m. on the 18th, representatives of the students of the Civil Engineering Department went to see Principal Xiao again, requesting that Professor Cai Fangyin be retained. Principal Xiao expressed that he had not heard of Cai's resignation. He said: If there is such a thing, the school will sincerely try to persuade him to stay. While the representatives were talking with the president, the students of the department were gathering outside the door and making noise. Director Wu tried to dissuade them at the scene, but some students shouted to fight, and some refused to leave. Principal Xiao came out of the room to stop them. After admonishing them face-to-face, they dispersed.

This commotion foreshadowed the beginning of the student strike. At about 3:00 p.m., the students of the third and sixth grades and the third and eighth grades of the College of Engineering's Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Department also issued some slogans of "We want professors" and "We want libraries." Some impatient students even shouted the slogan "The school should not be bureaucratic." The incident gradually expanded, and the fire of the student strike had already been ignited in the school. The students of the College of Science marched in teams again on the evening of the 18th, at about 10:00 p.m., and went to Principal Xiao's residence to petition. They demanded the hiring of more professors and the addition of books and instruments. After Principal Xiao told the petitioning students of the College of Science about the hard work he had put in planning, the matter was settled peacefully.

At about 11:00 p.m. that night, another group of students shouted the slogans "Down with Xiao!" and "Strike tomorrow!" When the crazy ranks passed by the principal's residence, Principal Xiao called the students to gather and give a speech, but they refused to listen. Bricks flew around, and Principal Xiao's head was injured by the flying rocks at this time. A student in the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Department also fell and injured his head because he could not run away in time when the school workers dispersed the crowd. Meetings, marches, shouting slogans,... lasted all day - the 18th - the student strike was formed in these riots.

Although the professors went to class on time on the morning of the 19th, some students automatically missed classes. The overall student request for leave started from the 20th. They decided to take an oath at the general assembly of the entire school held at 1:00 p.m. on the 20th that they would not cancel the leave until the goal was achieved, and they would hold a chain guarantee. More than eight-tenths of the students signed their names, echoing this "overall request for leave." And each of the four colleges and 54 tea grades elected one representative to organize the "National Chung Cheng University Department-Level Joint School Protection Movement Committee." Each of the four colleges and specialized courses elected one representative to organize the presidium. They unanimously resolved to request: Principal Xiao's resignation, a telegram to Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Education, and Director Xiong Tianyi, requesting approval of Principal Xiao's resignation, and sending a declaration to all colleges and universities in the country. Now the person in charge of the school protection movement stated that the collective leave will be extended until Principal Xiao's resignation is approved.

At 2:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 19th, after the student strike, Principal Xiao convened a meeting of all faculty and staff and reported on the incident and his attitude toward the incident. He decided to be responsible until the 20th of this month. From the 21st, the school affairs will be temporarily handled by the school affairs committee. After hearing this news, all the faculty and staff were very sorry. During the faculty and staff meeting, it was decided to elect representatives to comfort Principal Xiao and send a telegram to the Ministry of Education to earnestly persuade Principal Xiao to stay. The professors also stated that they would not resume classes until the students realized their mistakes and requested to resume classes and the academic affairs office notified them.

Dean of Academic Affairs Luo Rongcui and Director Wu Shidong of the student affairs believed that the occurrence of the student strike had been brewing for quite some time, but there was no excuse to borrow. On the eve of this big exam, some professors intended to resign and took the opportunity to incite the students. This was also the painstaking effort of the "wire pullers." As for the resignation of Professor Cai Fangyin, there was no prior notice. Regarding the hiring of professors, they had already been invited separately, either because the term of other schools had expired, or they were still stranded abroad, so they were still lacking. Because Principal Xiao held a secret and refused to abuse the attitude, and the students' course selection reached 18 points and 20 points, and some even exceeded them. The courses were opened slowly, leaving only politics, animal husbandry, and physical mathematics courses, and they could all be made up in a certain period. This is not a false statement, and the course schedule and course selection form can be used for comparison. The so-called academics and homework are all remarks against one's will that are made out of loss of reason.

Dean of Academic Affairs Luo Rongzi also guaranteed with his personality that his words were not false.

Regarding the incident of Principal Xiao being injured by a stone, according to what Wu and Luo personally witnessed, the situation at the time was extremely serious. The students went back and forth repeatedly, as if they had to put Principal Xiao to death. After Principal Xiao was injured, he was moved indoors, and the broken stones were still thrown in from the windows, and he was cursed with vicious voices: "Xiao is a bastard."

Dean of Academic Affairs Luo Rongzi said: If the students of Zhengda do not repent in time and expand the storm, it will inevitably lead to a decisive action by the authorities. (Sent from Nanchang on February 26)

In the fifth minute, Cao Qinfang launched a surprise attack, which Zhang Banglun caught squarely. Tung Wah seized the opportunity to attack. Jia Youliang orchestrated an offensive, taking a long-range shot from 30 yards out. Zhang Rongcai leaped to save it, but fumbled, and the ball bounced off the crossbar, narrowly avoiding a goal. Shortly after, Tung Wah's five forwards advanced, and Yu Yu's territory was entirely controlled by Tung Wah. Luo Xulai committed a foul 18 yards from the goal, and Sun Lojin took the penalty, but missed. Tung Wah attacked relentlessly for quite some time. Three minutes before the end of the first half, Zhu Meilong took a corner kick, and Bama shot powerfully, but it landed squarely in Banglun's arms, avoiding disaster. The first half ended with a 0-0 draw.

Two Goals in a Row

After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed the battle with the same lineup. After the kickoff, Yu Yu launched an attack, but Tung Wah's Zhang Lingen and Han Longbo resisted strongly. In the second minute, Jia Youliang advanced on the right flank and passed the ball to the center. Chen Mingzhe met it with a kick, and the ball landed in front of the goal. Han Longhai arrived in time to gently flick it into the net. Tung Wah took the lead 1-0. After losing the first goal, Yu Yu was unwilling to give up. Bama led the four forwards in a rapid advance. Dian Shuping dribbled past Zhuang Youren and took a powerful shot near the goal. The shot was swift and fierce. Zhang Banglun remained calm and collected, punching the ball out for a corner. Zhu Longmei took the corner, but it came to nothing. In the 18th minute of the melee, Jia Youliang attacked again. Zhang Rongcai got the ball but fumbled. Han Longhai rushed forward and kicked it into the net, making it 2-0 for Tung Wah. Yu Yu, determined to retaliate, launched a desperate counterattack, but Tung Wah's defense was tight and impenetrable, and they were unable to succeed. Before the final whistle, Tung Wah defeated Yu Yu again 2-0, creating a great record of eight wins in eight games. The First Division Championship is now firmly in their grasp.

### Women's Basketball: Xuebai Wins Second Place, Qinglian Resists, Left With Only Four Players, Forfeits; Chunmao Defeats Encas

[Our Reporter] Last night's basketball league featured one women's game and two Group A First Division games. The audience was enthusiastic, numbering no less than five or six hundred people. In the women's game, Xuebai and Qinglian competed for second place. Xuebai was outstanding. At 26 minutes and 30 seconds into the fourth quarter, the score was 22-19. Only four Qinglian players remained due to fouls. Under women's rules, the game could not continue, so Xuebai won by forfeit, 2-0. In the Group A First Division, Chunmao defeated Encas 38-30 in the first game. The two sides engaged in physical play, with stiff movements. In the second game, the Navy & Army Youth League's defense was impenetrable, and they won a decisive victory over the Railway Jing, with a score of 75-39, a significant difference. Details are as follows:

Xuebai Wins Against Qinglian

In the women's competition for second place, all three Xuebai forwards were taller than the Qinglian defenders. Zhang Xiuli made both free throws, Zhu Jiazhen scored, and Zhang scored again, giving them a dominant lead of seven points. Qinglian relied on Sun Fengzhu and Liu Huishan to score. In the first quarter, Xuebai held a 7-3 advantage.

Liu Huishan added two points, and Sun made one free throw, narrowing the gap to just one point (7-6). Xuebai's Wang Shan entered the game, replacing Zhu Jiazhen, making the team even more coordinated. Zhu Jiazhen, in her bright sweater, stood out like "a red flower among the green." She also had the posture to be on camera. In the second quarter, Xiuli scored four points, Wang Huiling two, and the late-arriving Wang Shan four, while Qinglian's Sun scored one free throw and Liu made two free throws. The second quarter ended 16-6.

In the third quarter, with the score at 21-7, Qinglian adjusted its formation, sending Li Huizhen to the front line and recalling Zhu Lanzhen to defense. At 27-7, Lanzhen fouled out, leaving only five players. With two forwards and three defenders, eight minutes passed with the score at 30-7.

In the final quarter, at 6 minutes and 30 seconds, with three and a half minutes remaining, the score was 32-9. Wang Wenzhu fouled out, leaving Qinglian with only four players. According to the rules, the game could not continue, so all records were erased, and Xuebai won against Qinglian by 2-0.

Chunmao Wins Against Encas

In the first Group A First Division game, Chunmao played against Encas. At the start, Chunmao scored four consecutive points. Soon after, Encas tied the score at 6-6. He Hanfu made a free throw, giving Chunmao a one-point lead. Ge Pengqi tied the score again (8 points). This guy had a particularly fierce eating habit. With a thrust of his stomach, he could bounce people several steps away. Liu Fushen scored two baskets, giving Chunmao a 12-8 lead. Huang Tianlie entered, replacing Chen Jiabiao, increasing the score to 16-9. At this time, Fushen had already scored 11 points. Before the buzzer, he scored another basket, giving Chunmao a 19-9 lead at halftime.

In the second half, Chunmao's Hanfu, Fushen, Li Xianzheng, and others scored. Encas worked hard to strengthen themselves. Ge Pengqi, Ge Fu, and Kailuosi suddenly increased their score to sixteen, but it was still difficult to stop Chunmao's momentum. The result was 38-30.

Navy & Army Youth League Wins Against Railway Jing

In the battle between the Navy & Army Youth League and the Railway Jing, Railway's Hu Sishen scored first, but Buruka Furulu's marvelous shots allowed the Navy & Army Youth League to rise rapidly. Railway relied on Yang Xianji to maintain the situation. In the first half, the Navy & Army Youth League led 34-20.

After the break, the "foreign soldiers" showed their power, surging forward and scoring 21 consecutive points (55-24). The other side only scored four points. The former's victory was due to its tight joint defense, making it difficult for Railway to break through and score close shots. The result was 75-39.

### Notes from the Basketball Court

Of the three basketball league games last night, only Chunmao's victory over Encas was relatively exciting. Huang Tianlie returned to the court after recovering from illness, making Chunmao's offense more active and allowing them to control the game. In the second half, they created a significant score difference of 26-13.

Liu Fushen maintained his usual high performance in every game. In yesterday's game, Fushen's positioning was accurate, and his long-range and close-range shots were all on target. He was the most outstanding player.

Since Bote left, Encas has lost a mid-range shooter, which is an irreparable loss. However, their stamina and fighting spirit have not diminished, and they are still promising. Last night, Encas was too overconfident and failed to focus on tightly guarding Fushen, which was a mistake.

He Hufu also worked hard. Xianzheng and Fuqiang defended tirelessly, preventing Encas from having many opportunities to follow up under the basket. Tianlie's performance was inconsistent, and he and Zheng Biao alternated on the court.

Baolai and E Kailuosi were the two most competent players for Encas, but the team's movements were still somewhat rough.

Five minutes before the end of the game, Fushen was knocked to the ground and left the court with an injury. He returned shortly after, stabilizing the situation.

After Fushen committed four fouls in the first half, he acted cautiously. If Fushen had fouled out, victory would not have belonged to Chunmao. (Chang Nian)

### New and Old Governors of the Central Bank to Hand Over Today, Bei Zuyi Held a Final Meeting Yesterday

[Our Reporter] After the National Government specially appointed Zhang Jia as the Governor of the Central Bank on the 1st, it was heard that Zhang will come to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Nanjing train this morning and is expected to assume office at the Central Bank at 9:00 AM.

The Central Bank has decided to hold a tea party at 4:00 PM today at its office at No. 15 Bund to entertain the heads of various agencies in the city and leaders of the financial community. At the same time, the handover ceremony between the new and old governors will be held.

After Bei Zuyi's resignation as Governor of the Central Bank was approved, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning with his secretary, Lu Dingzhong. Bei immediately went to the Central Bank to work. At around 10:00 AM, he convened a meeting of the heads of various departments to discuss the handover. Bei instructed the departments to complete their closing procedures yesterday in preparation for the handover today.

According to Lu Dingzhong of the Central Bank Secretariat, Bei has a history of lung disease and submitted his resignation in September last year, which was not approved. He has now earnestly requested the highest authorities to resign again and has finally been approved. Bei plans to go to Beiping for rest after the handover is completed and will not take up any new positions for the time being. Lu then showed reporters Bei's earnest letter to Chairman Chiang, which reads as follows: "Respectfully submitting this, I, Zuyi, was ordered to take over the Central Bank at the end of February 1946. Due to my lung disease, I requested a trial period of six months and submitted my resignation in early September, which was not approved. I am deeply grateful for your telegram of condolences and encouragement. I have since temporarily shouldered the heavy responsibility and tried my best to cope, hoping to exhaust my meager abilities to repay your kindness in one ten thousandth part. Half a year has passed since then. My talent cannot compensate for the difficulties and dangers, and my weak body can no longer bear the burden. I am filled with fear and trepidation. After careful consideration, in order to avoid delaying my duties, I earnestly request you to appreciate my sincere intentions and approve my resignation, selecting someone to replace me so that I can rest and recuperate. I will wait for the opportunity to repay your kindness in the future. I am earnestly praying. Respectfully presented to Chairman Chiang, Zuyi Bei respectfully presented, March 1st."

It was also reported that Lin Yinbao, Director of the Business Department of the Central Bank, Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department, Xu Xianda, Deputy Director, and Lu Dingzhong and Zhu Kunshou, Secretaries, have submitted their resignations to Bei Zuyi and have been approved. Many other staff members borrowed from the Bank of China also intend to leave. However, the final personnel changes will depend on discussions between the new and old governors, and the new governor will redeploy the staff. It is heard that after the new governor takes office, in order to maintain business continuity, he may temporarily retain Lin Fengbao, Lin Weiying, Xu Xianda, and others until suitable replacements can be found.

It is also said that after Zhang Jia'ao, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, takes over as the new governor, his vacated position of Deputy Governor will be filled by Liu Gongyun. Chen Xing, another Deputy Governor, will remain in his original position.

### The Import Control Committee Actively Reviews the Qualifications of Registered Importers

Oil Importer Qualifications Approved for 72 Companies

[Our Reporter] The Import Temporary Management Committee is actively promoting the review of the qualifications of registered importers. It is learned that in addition to the qualifications of importers of oil, rubber, cotton, and wool, the qualifications of importers of nine types of goods, including sulfurized raw materials, indigo, coal and coal briquettes, machine leather belts, burlap bags, rice, wheat, wheat flour, and hemp, have been reviewed. Starting this week, the qualifications of importers of oil waxes, starch, fertilizers, cement, military nitrous acid, and rayon will be investigated separately. During the investigation, in addition to relying on the credit information provided by the designated banks, the importers of each category will be invited to attend meetings or submit missing documents for review.

According to a person in charge of the committee, the review of the qualifications of importers is quite heavy. The review is based on the Customs Tariff. Each tariff has a standard, which is based on the business volume of direct imports by each importer in 1946. However, each tariff often contains multiple commodities. For example, the item "hardware" lists as many as 84 types of goods, and an importer often engages in the import of multiple commodities. To be fair and practical, it is necessary to review each item one by one to see if it meets the standard. Therefore, although only 3,000 registration applications have been submitted by importers in the city, the actual review work is equivalent to reviewing 40,000 to 50,000 applications. Therefore, the delay and time-consuming nature of the review work is due to this. However, as a result of active promotion, the qualifications of importers of 25 types of quota-limited imported materials have been mostly reviewed.

[Also reported] It is learned that a total of 72 importers have obtained oil import qualifications. Among them, 30 are for kerosene, 7 for gasoline, 7 for lubricating oil, 15 for fuel oil, and 13 for lubricating oil.

### Shanghai National Products Factory Federation Requests Relaxation of Raw Material Quotas

Since the government implemented the import control policy, the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation has hoped to relax the import quotas of raw materials in order to increase production. After convening several discussions with member factories, collecting opinions from all parties, and formulating reasons, they requested the Import Control Committee to approve the adoption. According to Cheng Shouzhong, the person in charge of the association, the main points are as follows:

(1) The raw material needs of all member factories in the association vary greatly due to different business natures. If the Import Control Committee imposes quota allocations on the import of industrial raw materials, the first step in the allocation must be to first investigate the existing power equipment of various factories and accurately estimate the amount of raw materials required for each machine and the amount of finished products that can be produced. Then, the allocated quota is approved, so that production can be increased, prices can be stabilized, and national industries can be supported.

(2) The Import Control Committee should expedite the approval of foreign exchange settlement applications for imported goods to facilitate the export of industrial products and avoid factory shutdowns, which would waste daily expenses.

(3) The Import Control Committee should carefully classify imported raw materials and finished products. After the quota is allocated, the quantity is necessary for each factory. If the quantity of imported finished products is included in the quota, the scope of raw material quotas will be reduced.

(4) The first priority for revitalizing national industries after the war is to fully supply raw materials. If raw materials are in short supply, survival will be difficult and development will be impossible. Therefore, this investigation is extremely important. If the investigation can be conducted first, the quota allocation will also be more practical. If manpower is difficult to oversee for a time, the authorities can transfer the order to various people's organizations to jointly assist in the handling.

### Private Transactions of Gold Are Difficult to Completely Eliminate

[Our Reporter] Since the central government promulgated the ban on gold trading, the black market for gold has disappeared, but private, small-scale transactions have not been completely eliminated. When reporters asked the mayor about this, the mayor did not deny it and said that he had told President Song some days ago that although the gold ban had been promulgated, black market transactions were still feared to be unstoppable. President Song asked why, and he gave an example: Suppose A brings a gold bar to B's house and borrows 5.7 million yuan from B. This act is not a crime and cannot be detected by the military police, but a black market transaction has already been constituted. Regarding this private transaction, the mayor said that it would be difficult to completely eliminate it for a while.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation Revival Loan Limited to Repayment Within Two Years

[Our Reporter] Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently established a loan of US$5 million with the Bank of China to revive the Taiwan sugar industry. The loan is limited to repayment within two years. It is heard that the company has also obtained approval from the Central Bank to settle foreign exchange at the official exchange rate at the time of repayment in the future. It is understood that the main purpose of the loan is to order a large number of sugar factory machines and transportation railway equipment from the United States. Now that the loan has been secured, all of the equipment is expected to be shipped to Taiwan in batches before August and September of this year. Therefore, the sugar production plan for the end of this year and the spring of next year, which is to transport 3 million tons of sugarcane and produce 300,000 tons of sugar, will be achieved as scheduled.

### New Flour Prices to Be Implemented Today

The adjustment of flour prices has been approved by Mayor Wu and will be officially implemented today. The new adjusted prices are: (1) Lilang flour, 70 pounds per bag, 70,000 yuan per bag; (2) Local flour, 40 pounds per bag, 47,000 yuan per bag. These new prices will not be adjusted again within the next three months. If the price exceeds the limit, the offenders will be severely punished in accordance with the price-fixing regulations.

(Also reported) The municipal government has scheduled a meeting of flour merchants within days to discuss the distribution of foreign flour arriving in Shanghai and government subsidies to flour mills.

### Enemy Property Factories Re-evaluated and Sold by Tender in Short Term

[Our Reporter] The China Trust Bureau's Property Liquidation Office is currently re-evaluating enemy property, and factory parts will be announced for sale by tender in the near future. Relevant sources said that prices have fluctuated sharply in the past six months, and the valuation from last fall is no longer appropriate. Among the remaining enemy and puppet materials, real estate accounts for the main position. The estimate last fall was already worth 200 billion yuan, and it is now far more than this figure. Among the real estate, some of the buildings are used for aircraft, and sales should be easiest. Another part has been allocated to influential people for residence, and compensation should not be a problem. The most problematic are the alley houses, which are occupied by more than one household. The competent authorities hope to trade collectively to save procedures. If this is not possible, they will contact the tenants individually to sell. As for the remaining factories, most of them are dilapidated and of little value.

### China Silk Corporation Investigates Wartime Silk Industry Losses: 200,000 Metric Tons of Silk and 2 Billion Mulberry Trees Lost; Silk Industry Equipment Losses Valued at 300 Million Pre-War Legal Tender

Our country is one of the world's major sericultural nations, with silk being a major export commodity and a primary source of foreign exchange. During the War of Resistance, the silk-producing areas in the Northeast, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces, which were occupied, accounted for 90% of the national total. Moreover, farmland in the occupied areas was left barren, and the damage to the foundations of breeding farms and silk mills made it difficult to restore production to pre-war levels even after six years. Before the war, our country's annual silk production could reach 100,000 to 150,000 metric tons, but currently it is only 15,000 metric tons, which demonstrates the severity of the destruction. Japan's silk production, except for a small portion for domestic use, is mostly for export, and Japan currently has a large stock of cocoons. Therefore, using these as compensation for our country's wartime losses would be most appropriate. Our delegation in Japan is continuing to make every effort to argue this point.

Investigating National Silk Losses

The China Silk Corporation has specifically organized the "National Silk Losses Investigation Committee During the War of Resistance." Sun Bohe and six others have been appointed as members to conduct a nationwide investigation. The scope includes: (1) silk farmers, (2) mulberry gardens, (3) breeding farms, (4) cocoon markets, (5) silk mills, and (6) losses of relevant silk-related organizations, schools, and societies. The investigation content includes: (1) direct losses of building equipment, (2) direct losses of manufactured products, (3) cumulative indirect business losses over the years, (4) cumulative losses due to control and price suppression over the years, and (5) losses during the repatriation period (including increased burdens on the national treasury and the people). The investigation covers the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Shandong. Major reports from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and other provinces have already been received and will be compiled into a general report to be submitted to the Central Compensation Committee.

Astonishing Losses in China's Silk Industry

According to estimates by the China Silk Corporation, China's wartime losses in the silk industry are as follows: (A) Silk production losses: (1) Domestic silkworm silk production loss of 1,603,000 metric tons, (2) Wild silkworm silk production loss of 400,000 metric tons, totaling 1,003,000 metric tons. (B) Equipment losses: (1) 2,600,000 sericultural households suffered losses, with a total value of 236,000,000 yuan. (2) Seed production reduced by 4,600,000 sheets, with a total loss of 10,900,000 yuan. (3) Silk reeling industry lost 45,000 silk reeling machines, with a total loss of 28,100,000 yuan. (4) Other losses totaled 2,500,000 yuan. The total equipment losses (in pre-war legal tender value) amounted to 300,000,000 yuan. (C) Mulberry garden abandonment losses: (1) 2,180,000 mu of mulberry gardens were abandoned, resulting in the loss of 1,132,000,000 mulberry trees. (2) 5,360,000 mu of mulberry gardens were damaged, requiring the replenishment and renewal of 868,000,000 trees. The total number of mulberry trees lost was 2,000,000,000.

### Mayor Wu Pleads for the Jewelry Industry; Suggests Allowing the Buying and Selling of Gold Jewelry; Feasibility Subject to Central Government Approval

[Our Report] Since the central government issued the ban on gold trading, the livelihood of the jewelry industry has been cut off. Representatives have petitioned the municipal government several times, claiming that Mayor Wu, as the "father and mother official" of the city's residents, would be willing to alleviate the difficulties of those in the jewelry industry. They earnestly requested that Mayor Wu, in addition to submitting a written report, also make an oral appeal to the authorities, which Mayor Wu promised to do. Upon Mayor Wu's return to Shanghai from Beijing, reporters specifically visited him to inquire whether the future of the jewelry industry had been discussed during his time in Beijing. He replied that he had indeed made an urgent appeal on their behalf and had suggested a concrete solution to Chairman Chiang, namely, to allow the free buying and selling of gold jewelry. Jewelry stores could directly purchase jewelry from citizens and freely sell jewelry to citizens, but they would be absolutely prohibited from buying and selling gold bars or selling the jewelry they purchased after melting it into bars. In this way, the gold market would not be affected, and the livelihood of the jewelry industry could be maintained. Mayor Wu also stated that this solution had been thoroughly discussed with Minister Yu Hongjun and Deputy Minister Xu, and they all considered it reasonable. Whether this method can be approved awaits consultation by the central government, and a final decision is expected in the coming days.

### Active Trading in Yellow Weasel Pelts

[Our Report] There has been a significant amount of trading in yellow weasel pelts recently, with overseas market prices frequently increasing. Jewish merchants, in particular, have a strong appetite. The trading price is 36,000 yuan per pair. It is reported that the New York price is approximately US$3.50. Lake sheep pelts, which have not been seen for a long time, have also appeared on the market, with a price of 12,000 yuan per piece. Green sheep pelts are 15,000 yuan per piece, while whole sheep pelts are 16,000 yuan per piece, and white sheep pelts are 17,000 yuan per piece, all up 1,000 yuan from the previous day. Trading in all goods is lively, reversing the previous stagnation.

### Shanghai Cement Factory Preparing to Resume Operations

Shipments Possible in Early April

[Our Report] The Shanghai Cement Factory is currently preparing to resume operations. Due to the recent shortage of coal, it has decided to convert to diesel engines starting in March. It is estimated that shipments can begin in early April. The factory is still located in Longhua. The first phase of production is currently set at 70,000 pounds. The factory was founded in 1920 and officially started shipping in 1923. It was forced to cease operations after the outbreak of the war. After the victory, it resumed operations, but due to the dumping of foreign goods, sales were lacking, and the difficulty in purchasing coal led to another suspension of operations last month. The factory's cement production was originally second in Shanghai but has now fallen to third place due to various setbacks.

Another report: Among our country's cement factories, those in the north include the Liaoning Cement Factory, Jinxi Cement Factory, and North China Cement Factory, which are affiliated with the Resources Committee. Private enterprises include Qixin Cement Company. Shanxi has the Taiyuan Cement Factory, and the Jiangnan area has the China Cement Factory and the Shanghai Cement Factory. According to a responsible person at Qixin Company, the company's main sales are currently concentrated in the Central China area. North China currently does not need it due to climate conditions. The company's cement shipments to the Nanjing-Shanghai area this month are 7,000 tons, with 90% purchased by the government for use in the Longhai, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Nanjing-Shanghai railways. The company's cement production is greater than that of China Cement Company, and the prices are similar. Currently, our country's cement industry, due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, the main raw material gypsum has increased fivefold compared to before, and packaging materials such as hemp bags and cardboard boxes have also risen sharply. While cement prices have only risen by 20%, the difficulties of dumping of foreign goods have already been overcome, but the difficulty of obtaining raw material coal is just beginning.

### Shanghai Iron and Steel Company is Ready

Our country's steel production has historically been abundant in the Northeast. The steel raw materials needed in the Southeast region mostly depend on foreign supply, resulting in huge losses. Shanghai is the industrial center of the country, and the steel raw materials required are plentiful. Therefore, it is an urgent task to build the foundation of heavy industry in the Southeast industrial zone and increase steel production. The authorities have made increasing steel production a major goal of current construction. Recently, Liu Gongyun, a leader in the financial sector and director of the Central Trust Bureau, on behalf of the Central Trust Bureau, invited Chen Shouchang, Yu Mingyu, and others from the Shanghai steel industry to organize the Shanghai Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. to cooperate with the government's steel production increase plan, build the foundation of heavy industry in Central China, reduce the outflow of funds, inject foreign exchange, and increase employment opportunities. After the shortest period of efforts, the company has been prepared. It is reported that Liu Gongyun has been elected as chairman, and Shen Xirui, Zhang Liment, Chen Shouchang, and Wang Erzhen have been appointed as managing directors. Yu Mingyu has been appointed as the general manager of the company, and Liu Tianhong and Ren Jiakun have been appointed as deputy general managers. Metallurgical expert Tang Zhisu has been hired as the chief engineer, Tang Hanzong as the factory director of the first factory, Yu Enpei as the factory director of the second factory, and Zhu Hengqing as the director of the business department. Currently, the mechanical equipment of the second factory on Huangxing Road has been installed. If there are no problems with the electricity supply, production and shipment can begin next month. It is estimated that large-scale production will be possible in the second half of the year, which is an active and effective remedy in the current crisis of excessive imports and will be of great benefit to the current economic situation.

### Rationing of Rayon to be Decided This Morning

Regarding the rationing of rayon, a responsible person at the Central Trust Bureau told reporters yesterday that the rationing of rayon to the silk weaving industry will be decided at a meeting this morning, and distribution may begin today or tomorrow. Before the monthly quota is approved, one-fifth of the original quota will be distributed first. They also stated that half of the silk weaving machines have joined the production and sales joint venture company, for which the authorities have already allocated raw materials, so only half need rayon to be rationed. The Bureau will no longer ration to machines that have joined in exporting silk weaves.

Red Rice Rises

Due to the scarcity of red rice arrivals and inventory, the market is tight. It is reported that the Shantou price is above 4 customs units, so the Shanghai market price is up by 30-40% or more, and the trend is that prices will rise in the future without falling.

### The Value of the US Dollar in the East

In Asia, there is more money than goods. As a result, one US dollar today can buy more in the United States than in most countries in the East. The US "World Report Weekly" recently listed and compared the official exchange rates of the US dollar and currencies of various Eastern countries as follows:

China: 12,000 yuan

Hong Kong: 3.95 yuan

Vietnam: 6.99 piastres

Thailand: 9.93 baht

Singapore: 2.12 dollars

Philippines: 2 pesos

Japan: 15 yen

Korea: 5 won

Dutch East Indies: 2.65 guilders

Ceylon: 3.30 rupees

India: 3.30 rupees

Soviet Union: 5.30 rubles

Afghanistan: 13.50 afghanis

Iran: 31.75 rials

Iraq: 0.25 dinars

Turkey: 2.81 pounds

Most of the numbers listed above do not truly represent the actual purchasing power of the currencies of those countries. Black markets exist in all countries because people prefer to hoard stable US dollars. For example, in China, the official exchange rate of the US dollar to legal tender used to be 3,350 yuan, but it has recently been changed to 12,000 yuan. In Iran, the official exchange rate is 31.75 rials, but on the black market, 40 rials are required to exchange for one US dollar. The purchasing power of the US dollar on the black market is probably stronger than at the official exchange rate. One reason is that the amount of currency in circulation in various Eastern countries has greatly increased, while production is still far lower than before the war. As a result, prices have risen to the point where the US dollar can buy less in Asia than it can domestically.

### Last Year's Musk Exports Valued at Over 1 Billion National Currency

Musk is one of the most important raw materials for making perfume and perfume essences. The best quality musk comes from Xikang Province in our country. Each year a considerable amount is sold. According to statistics, our country exported 3,300 grams of musk last year, worth more than 1 billion yuan in legal tender. However, the actual exports far exceed this number because musk is a valuable item, extremely light, and easy to carry. Therefore, there is a great deal of smuggling, which cannot be counted. The United States absorbs the most musk from our country, accounting for about 80% of exports. Before the war, France's perfume manufacturing industry was developed, and the amount of musk imported from our country was considerable. After the war, it has become greatly diminished. Last year, there were only 80-90 million yuan in transactions.

### Cooperative Treasury Requests Allocation of 10 Billion for Construction

[Our Report] Since its establishment, the Central Cooperative Treasury has successively prepared to set up branches in Huaiyin, Taixian, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Qingdao, Beiping, and other places. Other branches and sub-offices in the pacification areas are also being prepared. The treasury has recently requested the Ministry of Finance to allocate 10 billion yuan for cooperative financial construction to be used for cooperative loans and to guide consumer and production cooperatives in various regions.

### Internal and External Trade is Bartered

The Tianjin Municipal Government received a telegram from the Northeast Economic Commission stating that after the promulgation of urgent economic measures, the prices of daily necessities have been independently determined by the competent authorities in various regions. Please notify the Grain Industry Association that if they want to purchase soybeans, soybean cakes, etc. from the Northeast, they can use cloth, yarn, sugar, tea, etc. to exchange for the price.

Another report: Demand for cotton production in the Northeast exceeds supply. The Northeast Executive Headquarters Economic Committee recently revised the internal and external trade adjustment measures. The transport regulations related to cotton in the "Permissible Items" stipulate that any cotton entering the customs weighing more than ten kilograms, regardless of the method of consignment, must be approved by the committee.

### Introducing a Table of Foreign Exchange Rate Equivalents

Mr. Zhang Yazhuang of Huaqiao Bank has compiled a book of equivalent exchange rates for British, American, Hong Kong, Indian, and Dutch currencies. The calculations are accurate and the search is convenient. By citing the exchange rate of any one currency, the market price of the other four can be found. The entire book is 51 pages and is sold at 120 Jiujiang Road.

### Tea Tasting Experts

Seven tea experts in the United States evaluate various imported teas at the US Tea Inspection Office. They have a special sense of discrimination of tea taste and use smell and taste to determine the quality of various teas. The picture shows the experts sitting around a rotating round table, taking turns to evaluate various tea samples.

### Various Aspects of Korean Residents in Jiangbei

—Shenyang, February 20th (Airmail Report) by our Special Correspondent Han Qingtao

Tight-fitting long skirts, small tops, pure white and light red colors, make them bright and vibrant, with a style still reminiscent of ancient times. With the flowing skirt belts, although one cannot say that they are all "graceful and charming", many of them are beautiful. This is the attire of young Korean women. As for Korean patriots and soldiers, the bravery and wisdom they displayed in the Northeast, with blood, tears, and backbone, is an epic history of struggle worth singing and weeping about. Korean farmers are diligent and hardworking, and their enthusiasm and harvest in rice planting are also well-known. Anyone who has been to the Northeast probably appreciates this.

Northeast compatriots have seen the bravery and beauty of the Korean residents, and at the same time, they have also seen the ugliness and filth of another group of people. Those people are sneaky, despicable, barbaric, bully others by relying on their power, and manufacture and sell drugs. Northeast compatriots do not know how much humiliation and harm they have suffered from them. They act arrogantly and make money under the guise of being "elder brothers of the subjugated people."

These degenerate Korean residents poison our Northeast compatriots. Our Northeast compatriots have suffered too much from them. There is no place to appeal for injustice, and no way to assert reason. If the matter is taken to the Japanese government, our compatriots will still suffer, which has caused the people of the Northeast to have a headache and hatred towards the Korean residents. In private, they curse them as "Korean bastards!"

This responsibility should be borne by the Japanese, and it cannot be said that it is entirely the inferiority of the Korean residents. Because the Japanese wanted to make the Koreans an inferior nation and to make them thugs, so that the Japanese could reap the benefits. They also feared the unity of the Korean residents and did divisive work among them, so the current situation of mutual distrust and divergent opinions among the Korean residents was cultivated.

Two Million People

In the past, the number of Korean residents living in the Northeast was quite large. According to the statistics of the puppet Manchuria, there were a total of two million people, accounting for approximately 5% of the total population of the Northeast region. Historical research shows that the history of Koreans residing in the Northeast dates back to hundreds of years ago.

At the time of the September 18th Incident, there were 1.5 million Korean residents in the Northeast. They can be divided into three major categories: one is the Korean residents who originally lived on the Sino-Korean border, one is those who fled to the Northeast after Japan annexed Korea, and the third is those who were supported by Japan to immigrate to the Northeast after Japan occupied the Northeast.

The Korean residents are distributed throughout the Northeast region, mostly in the Sino-Korean border area, the Songhua River and Liao River basins, and various large and small cities. 90% of them are farmers, and the rest are engaged in industry and commerce. There are also those who "do evil" and "commit all kinds of crimes."

Most of the Korean residents are farmers, so the rice paddies in the valleys of the Northeast are mostly cultivated by Korean farmers. Most of the rice paddies were forcibly occupied under the Japanese colonial policy. Because of this, many discords arose between the residents of various places and the Korean residents.

The victory was achieved. The flames of war spread and spread. The ground was unstable and there was no way to plant seeds. Many of the forcibly occupied lands, the Korean farmers dared not plant, so at least one-third of the rice paddies in various places were abandoned. The life and economic foundations that the Korean residents in other cities had previously established under the Japanese power were also collapsing, so the lives of the Korean residents fell into extreme poverty.

Approximately 50,000 Korean residents voluntarily crossed the river to return to their country through Shenyang and Andong. 2,500 people were sent back to their country before the year by the US military in South Korea. Currently, there are still 1.3 million Korean residents in the nine provinces of the Northeast. Approximately 40,000 people are in the areas recovered by the National Army, and the remaining 80,000 to 90,000 people are in the areas occupied by the Communist Army.

Partial Repatriation

Our government has consistently maintained a policy of preferential treatment towards the 1 million Korean residents in the Northeast. Therefore, the handling policy is one of leniency, in order to achieve amity between the Chinese and Korean nations and to strive for peace in East Asia. Benign Korean residents are all allowed to continue residing and assist in production. Unkind residents will be repatriated to their country under a joint agreement between the two countries in the future. Regarding the Korean residents' property, also because the situation in the Northeast is special, the Northeast Executive Headquarters will refer to the local situation to formulate handling measures, which are currently under review by the Executive Yuan. It is said that this measure has been reviewed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relevant agencies and will be announced and implemented by the Executive Yuan soon.

In the summer of 1946, Korean residents in Shenyang established the "Shenyang Korean Residents General Association", with Shen Su as the chairman. On his way to Nanjing in the autumn of last year, he met with American personnel from the Beiping Military Mediation Department. At that time, he talked about the fact that there were tens of thousands of Korean refugees in the Northeast who had no livelihood and planned to return to their country, but had no way to go. The American representative especially telegraphed General MacArthur in Tokyo, and soon received a reply, allowing the repatriation of refugees to their country, but not to exceed 15,000 people, and only those living in South Korea who voluntarily wanted to return to their home country were allowed. Because the United States' overall Pacific repatriation work ended at the end of 1946, it was stipulated that the ships transporting Korean residents must return to Tokyo before December 31. Our side received the notification close to December, which was too short a period. The Korean residents, even more, were mostly unwilling to return to their country, so as a result, only 2,500 people were concentrated and great efforts were made to send them out of the Northeast.

For this repatriation of Korean residents, our country provided vehicles, ships, food, accommodation, sanitation, medical care, and all other expenses, with preferential treatment. Therefore, it was called repatriation, but it was actually escort. The repatriated people were quite aware of our side's kindness. In the future, if the Korean residents do not voluntarily request it, they will no longer be repatriated. This is the process and reason for the repatriation of Korean residents in the Northeast.

Rice and Korean Farmers

Before the restoration of the Northeast on August 15, Korean residents in the Northeast numbered no less than two million, and had cultivated 5.17 million mu of rice paddies. The total rice production could reach approximately 4.2 million shi, accounting for one-sixth of the total grain production in the Northeast. By 1946, more than half of the rice paddies were abandoned, and rice production was no longer sufficient to supply the needs of the Northeast. If this continues, there will be problems with the entire rice production in the Northeast. Because Northeast farmers are not good at growing rice in terms of habits, physical strength, and physiology, it is necessary to use Korean farmers. In the future, if we plan to maintain rice production in the Northeast, borrowing the strength of Korean farmers is a major plan. Today, among the industries operated by Korean residents in the recovered areas that have resumed operation, there are two rubber factories and three or four iron factories in Shenyang, six or seven "refined rice factories", and five or six iron factories and "refined rice factories" in Changchun. In addition, there are several iron factories and "refined rice factories" in Jilin and Yingkou, Andong, and other places.

The "Korean Residents Association" in Shenyang recently submitted a letter to the Shenyang Municipal Government on behalf of all Korean residents in Shenyang, saying: "The Korean residents living in Shenyang, because of the announcement of the central government's policy of leniency and the government's efforts to care for the Korean residents, have not only received spiritual comfort and liberation, but also the repatriation affairs of the Korean residents have been able to proceed smoothly. In the past year, the rice paddies cultivated by Korean farmers have been more than 3,000 hectares, more than 20 primary schools and 2 middle schools have been restored, dozens of industrial and commercial enterprises have been opened, and the "Korean Residents Industry Promotion Association" has been allowed to purchase rice produced by Korean farmers to supply military rations, so that Korean residents have the opportunity to express Sino-Korean friendship, and they are extremely grateful."

In addition, it cannot be denied that there are still a small number of Korean residents who are secretly doing sneaky things, as well as selling drugs, colluding with our ignorant compatriots to commit crimes. At the same time, because of the ban on dancing, many Korean dancers have changed their livelihood. Many prostitutes who engage in flesh and blood careers mostly spend the money of our compatriots. These compatriots act as their bosses. The rudeness and diseases are harming our armed brothers and working-class compatriots. Shijianfang Street in Shenyang is just this kind of situation.

New Sino-Korean Relations

Our government has been supporting the Korean independence movement for more than 30 years. The human resources, material resources, and financial resources spent cannot be counted. Even today, our government still provides the Korean delegation with several tens of thousands of yuan in expenses every month. At the Cairo Conference, Chairman Chiang first proposed the independence of Korea. After the victory, the government maintained its consistent policy and supported the Provisional Government of that country.

After Mr. Kim Gu, the chairman of the Provisional Government, returned to his country, our government extended deep sympathy and allowed him to keep a delegation stationed in China as diplomatic envoys to handle the affairs of overseas Chinese. Currently, the head of the delegation, Pu Chunfang, is stranded in Shenyang due to illness, and has established the Northeast General Office of the Korean Delegation in Xita, Shenyang. Director Bu Guang is a "China expert". In 1916, he graduated from China University in Beiping, and has since remained in China, fighting for the independence of his country. As for the overseas Chinese in the Northeast, various places have organized "Korean Residents Associations". The city of Shenyang has a "Korean Residents General Association," which is the overall organization representing the Korean residents in the Northeast.

When the National Army entered Jinzhou, the Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters first established the "Korean Residents Affairs Office" to specifically handle matters such as the investigation of Korean residents and the registration of property. In the autumn of 1946, Chairman Chiang issued an order that matters related to Korean, Taiwanese, German, and Austrian overseas Chinese affairs should be handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, the former Korean Residents Affairs Office of the Headquarters was transformed into the "Korean Residents Affairs Office of the Northeast Special Envoy Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs" on September 26, 1946. The Korean Residents Affairs Office handles all general Korean residents affairs in the Northeast: such as the identification of kind and evil Korean residents, the protection of Korean residents, the statistics of household registration, the handling of property, the improvement of education, the relief of refugees, the increase in rice paddies, and the correction of ideological errors are all within the scope of its business.

Zhang Jianfei, the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Northeast, told reporters: "Today, the affairs of Korean residents in the Northeast are extremely important, and at the same time, we should have a new concept of Korean residents and do our best to help them!"

We hope that the Korean residents can recognize friends and enemies, can recall the past history of China and Korea, and can understand the future relationship between China and Korea in this world, make great efforts to universally and strongly establish the foundation of friendship between China and Korea!

### Northern Liaoning Education

— Changchun, 16th (Air Dispatch) - Our Reporter Zhao Zhan

The work of taking over education in Northern Liaoning was divided into two stages. The first stage began on January 10th of last year and lasted until the communist army captured Siping Street on March 17th. During this period, only the Culture and Education Section of the puppet People's Livelihood Department was taken over, and it was ordered to temporarily maintain the status quo without any increase or decrease in personnel. The second stage of the takeover began on May 23rd, and only then was the actual takeover work fully launched.

Second Phase of Takeover Work

Mongolian banner education is different from that in other parts of the mainland. A special department should be established to take charge of its management. Currently, the Department of Education only has three sections: Secondary Education, National Education, and Social Education. There is no separate department specifically for Mongolian banner education.

During the second phase of the takeover, a total of 30 schools were taken over, including 4 puppet Manchukuo national and provincial normal schools, 21 puppet Siping provincial national high schools, and 5 vocational schools, all of which were converted into provincial schools. Furthermore, the schools taken over were reorganized and merged according to their nature, and adjusted according to local needs. A total of 34 schools were added, including 9 normal schools, 20 middle schools, and 5 vocational schools. As for the measures to revise the school system, normal schools were transformed into teachers' colleges, divided into two departments: regular teachers and vocational teachers; national high schools were transformed into middle schools, divided into senior and junior high school sections; and vocational schools were divided into senior and junior sections.

The training and selection of primary and secondary school teachers is an important task in post-recovery educational administration. The training work that Northern Liaoning Education should carry out includes: (A) Primary and secondary school teacher training seminars, lasting two weeks, training 120 teachers; (B) Middle school faculty and staff training courses, lasting three weeks, training 209 faculty and staff. In the summer, a selection committee was organized to preside over the matter. The original plan was to conduct the assessment in the form of training, but it was terminated due to financial difficulties.

Education in Hibernation

Regarding the current state of national education, according to statistics from last October, out of the 269 recovered streets and villages in the province, 754 schools have resumed classes, with 86,037 students and 2,652 teachers. As for social education, it is very difficult to promote due to social unrest and widespread poverty. Currently, it is in a state of hibernation.

Mongolian banner education is currently impossible to promote. It is recommended that the education department include it in the education plan. The schools planned to be rebuilt after recovery include Wangye Temple Middle School, Wangye Temple Girls' Middle School, Kezuo Middle Banner Middle School, Kezuo Front Banner Middle School, Kezuo Rear Banner Advanced Agricultural Vocational School, Wangye Temple Advanced Agricultural Vocational School, Wangye Temple Junior Vocational School, Wangye Temple Medical College, Wangye Temple Normal School, and Girls' Normal School. All of the above schools are provincial schools, and it is planned to complete the training of Mongolian banner teachers within five years, which can train 3,000 teachers and increase the number of students to 100,000.

Status of Industry, Mining, and Agriculture

As mentioned earlier, Northern Liaoning is still under military control, and the pace of construction is quite slow. In terms of industry and mining, after the "March 17th" upheaval, all data related to industrial and mining surveys were burned. There is no detailed survey of the current situation and extent of damage to industry, commerce, fisheries, and mines in the province. It is only known that there are currently four provincial-run factories: (A) Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Factory (started operations on June 20th last year); (B) Improved Horseshoe Factory (started operations on August 29th); (C) Model Iron Factory (started operations on August 20th); (D) People's Livelihood Supply Cooperative. All of the above were reorganized from factories taken over from the puppet regime.

In terms of agriculture and animal husbandry, the construction includes: (A) Establishing provincial-run farms to implement joint management and collective production in order to gradually achieve modern agricultural management. Using the reclaimed land in the Dongliao River basin of Lishu County and the Shilizhen area of Changgang County that has been paid for, the unfinished irrigation projects will be continued as collective farms. The Dongliao River Farm was established last October. In addition, the unfinished water conservancy projects in Kouhe, Kaiyuan County, and Xinpan Mountain will be continued, and cooperative farms will be established using the nearby land that has not yet been paid for. (B) Establishing the Dongliao River Water Conservancy Project Agency. The Dongliao River has a long history of flooding. In order to prevent floods, the enemy puppet regime built large reservoirs and embankments in Shiling Village and Didazui Zi in the upper reaches of Lishu County, and implemented irrigation projects in Xiaochengzi Gujiazi in the lower reaches, but they were stopped due to surrender. After the recovery, it was decided to continue this project. In July last year, the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan and the Northeast Branch of the Administrative Yuan, together with the governments of Liaoning and Hebei provinces, jointly decided to establish the Dongliao River Water Conservancy Committee to be responsible for construction supervision and guidance, and the Dongliao River Water Conservancy Project Bureau to be responsible for design and construction. The embankment project is currently being vigorously repaired, and the downstream irrigation is just beginning to be surveyed. (C) In order to improve livestock breeds and develop the province's livestock industry, a branch of the Provincial Livestock Improvement General Farm was established in Wohutun, Liaoyang, but due to the lack of funds and talent, the results are minimal.

New Transportation Lines in Northern Liaoning

In terms of transportation, highways are the main artery in Northern Liaoning. Based on military needs, highways are being repaired in two grades. The repaired highway bridges are as follows: 1,400 kilometers of main highway surface repaired, 1,390 bridge piers repaired; 1,300 kilometers of secondary highway surface repaired, 100 bridges repaired. In addition, there are plans to open two new lines: one is the Kaiyuan-Xi'an Highway, which is 124 kilometers long and has 16 bridge piers; the other is the Siping-Hailong Highway, which is 190 kilometers long and has 33 bridges. Both have been surveyed and completed, and the Xing Yuan has allocated 3 million yuan as a subsidy for the construction of the Kaiyuan-Xi'an Highway, and work has already begun.

Northern Liaoning has extremely abundant natural resources, and has superior conditions for industry, mining, agriculture, and animal husbandry. What is lacking is capital and organizational strength. If these two problems can be solved, the future of Northern Liaoning's construction will be very promising.

### The Yellow River Flood Area Completes Three Plans, Preparing to Implement Reconstruction Work, Hefei Dispatch on February 28th

— Our Special Correspondent Kang Feng

The disaster victims in the Yellow River flood area of northeastern Anhui have already survived the terrible winter. According to Ye Yuanlong, director of the Anhui Relief and Rescue Branch, the number of people who suffered thoroughly from the floods in 1946 was 900,000, which is not as high as the rumors. Among these 900,000 disaster victims, the child victims have been accommodated in 600 child victim stations with 90,000 people. The Huai River embankment repair project has absorbed 30,000 to 100,000 able-bodied disaster victims, and the remaining tens of thousands of people are making a living by fishing in the waterfront area. Therefore, the famine of those engaged in production has been alleviated due to the work-relief flour and fish catches. The actual number of deaths does not exceed 10,000. Currently, the manpower and material resources that Anhui Province can mobilize are all preparing to implement reconstruction work in the Yellow River flood area. Professor Jiang Diqiu of the branch's agricultural technology department has completed three plans:

(1) Replanting: He has requested tractors from the Shanghai Joint Relief Committee and established mobile tractor stations in Wuhe, Fengyang, Shouxian, and Fuyang, with five machines at each station. Each machine cultivates 50 mu of land per day, so that the Yellow River flood area can be replanted.

(2) Seeds: The supply of seeds has been arranged. Because the wheat planting season has passed, the Executive Yuan has approved the allocation of 50,000 shi of sorghum, soybeans, and millet seeds for supply. In addition, the Administrative Yuan has exchanged 300 tons of flour for sorghum and soybean seeds, and the Administrative Yuan has also allocated 250 tons of cotton seeds and 15 tons of sorghum for supply. It is estimated that 2 million mu of the 4 million mu of disaster-stricken farmland in the Yellow River flood area will be replanted with the above seeds. The rest was replanted by farmers themselves after the floodwaters receded last winter.

(3) Agricultural Loans: The central government has decided to allocate 2.4 billion yuan, and the Wuhu Farmers Bank has sent people to northeastern Anhui to provide loans so that disaster-stricken farmers can purchase reconstruction equipment. Jiang Diqiu believes that the current replanting period must be sown before the end of March, and the tractors, seeds, and funds promised by the central government and the Joint Relief Committee must be allocated and delivered in a timely manner so that they can be deployed and used. If there is a delay, the seasonality of agriculture will frustrate the reconstruction of the Yellow River flood area. The Anhui Agricultural Assistance Committee, which will be held in Bengbu on March 5, will decide on the agricultural technical personnel and area allocation to be completed at the lower level.

Professor Jiang is Dedicated to Locust Control, the Green Terror Can Be Eliminated

From June to October 1946, the green terror of locusts in 15 counties in northeastern Anhui could have caused a major blow to the autumn harvest. Professor Jiang Diqiu fully launched locust control efforts. He set up 24 central locust catching stations in other areas. Three catties of one- to two-year-old juvenile locusts were exchanged for one catty of flour. One catty of five-year-old flying adult locusts was exchanged for one catty of flour. One catty of locust eggs was exchanged for four catties of flour. In five months, three large-scale locust catches were carried out. 400,000 soldiers, police, men, women, old and young were mobilized to catch locusts in the sorghum, wheat, bean and green leaves of northeastern Anhui, killing a total of 3.4 million catties of locusts, saving more than 10,000 tons of wheat and grain production, which is the first achievement in the history of northeastern Anhui. It is predicted that the locust plague this year can be reduced.

### The Communist Army in Chahar

— Urgent News from Zhangjiakou on February 15th, Our Reporter in Chahar Jie Zhong

It should be the season of spring, but the frontier is still snowing. The spring breeze cannot bring vitality and warmth. The people of Chahar Province are still in the bitter sea of sorrow and fear.

It has been more than four months since Chahar Province was recovered. The national army has made its greatest efforts to control all cities and transportation lines. The Ping-Sui Railway has been opened to traffic, and the train is crawling slowly on the repaired detour. From Beiping to Baotou, it carries passengers and goods all day long. This wounded artery has brought nutrition and hope to the people of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. There have only been two minor damages to the Ping-Zhang Line. Since the opening of the Zhang-Tong Line, there have been no accidents. The highways from Zhangyuan to various counties are all safely passable, and the urban security is now generally stable.

The communist army suffered irreparable failures due to strategic errors, and also suffered a lot in the battles of Jiming and Huailai. Its main force has withdrawn from Chahar Province, and large-scale activities have been suppressed. The mountains and ridges in eastern Chahar have always been the base of the communist army, and there are still three brigades of troops, with 7,000 to 8,000 people, carrying out "roving bandit" disturbances. Yun Ze leads a small number of troops, operating in the Beizi Temple area of ​​northern Chahar Mongolian banner. The political role exceeds the military value. Dananshan, Weiting, southern Chahar, is the old nest of the communist army in the Jin-Cha-Ji border area. Both sides have deployed heavy troops to guard it, and it seems that neither side has any active intentions.

All this shows that large-scale battles will not break out in Chahar Province in a short period of time. Developing pacification work is the task of the national army and the hope of the people.

At present, the cadres of the Chinese Communist Party are still intensifying the creation of disasters and evils. The political organization of the Chinese Communist Party has not retreated together with the military. Under the slogan of "counties do not leave counties, districts do not leave districts, and townships do not leave townships," a part of the cadres have been sent back to their own districts and townships to do internal money work. The rest are still active on the edge of the mountains and in the gaps where the national army's control is not enough. They rely on their familiarity with the geography, the complexity of the terrain, the strict organization, and the clear intelligence to their advantage. When the national army comes to eliminate them, they become invisible by turning into small pieces.

Night is the best cover for the communist army's activities. In the villages near their base, scattered communist army cadres will come at night. They want food and drink, revenge killings, and even grain and cloth. They want shoes and socks, meat and cigarettes. Young men, for fear of being recruited into the communist army, dare not stay at home at night. They spend the night in the ditches and hillsides in the cold of more than 20 degrees below zero, and have to wait until dawn.

In the areas where the communist army is rampant, the lives of the people are not guaranteed. The communist army hates the most are the Baojia chiefs who were elected by the people to help the government, and the compatriots who have served the national army. Twenty-five Baojia chiefs were killed by the communist army in Zhuolu County, and three were killed in Huailai County, making the people regard being a Baojia chief as a fearful path. The government also has to limit the people to take turns to serve every day. A family in Chongli County once had several soldiers of the national army passing by. They warmly entertained them and brought out "oil cakes" to comfort them. In less than two days, these two compatriots were stabbed to death by the communist army in the middle of the night! An old man in his sixties had both hands cut off by the communist army for cooking a meal for the national army. The communist army really takes killing as a "joke." After the Spring Festival, in a village in Huailai County, they performed "Yangko," and mixed in the old drama "The Case of Zha Mei," and actually cut three good people to death as Chen Shimei! Whenever the communist army arrives in a place, they always let the people leave quickly, which is called "running the situation." So they buried landmines everywhere, trying to trap the national army. The number of people who died under landmines is impossible to estimate.

In the places that have been fought over by the communist army, the houses are either without roofs or lack windows and doors. In the severe cold of more than 20 degrees below zero, the people lack clothing and fuel. Some use their beloved furniture as fuel, and some simply dismantle and burn houses. Many families have not added new clothes for ten years, and the tattered clothes can't even cover the places that are considered shameful in morality. Some families have only one decent set of clothes. Whoever goes out wears it first, and the rest have to cower in the mud pit.

After Chongli County was slaughtered and robbed by the communist army, the orphans and widows left behind have only received 10,000 yuan in relief money and dozens of catties of white flour per person in the past few months. They are not only short of food and clothing, but also panic about firewood and water!

Xinming County was formerly Dehua. After the Japanese surrender, a certain mechanized army lived there for more than 40 days, killing sheep and chickens every day. When they left, they drove away all the sheep and pulled away more than 6,000 cattle and three more horses. Then came the communist army's struggle for liquidation. Under the policy of "leveling the high and padding the low," in the end, as long as the farmers wearing leather jackets and felt hats became the targets of the struggle.

The Chinese Communist Party encourages its cadres in this way: "The more chaotic the society, the better, the more afraid the people, the better." Local ruffians are the capable cadres of the Chinese Communist Party and the life-threatening阎王 of the people. The night seems to enter hell, and the people hand over their lives to these "district dogs" and "district legs" (communist army cadres), and they may be killed at any time! Relatives were killed! Tears flow into the stomach, afraid that publicizing will bring more disasters!

The rural economy has moved towards the edge of production stagnation and bankruptcy. Spring is coming, and the spring ploughing season is approaching. Although the farmers have spring ploughing acquaintances, they have no spring ploughing conditions. The Chinese Communist Party's land policy and liquidation struggle have created many disputes. Although, in the current turbulent and insecure situation, no one dares to propose a solution too early. The landlords dare not ask about the liquidated land, fearing that the communist army will come back to struggle. The tenant farmers are unable to cultivate and are deliberately waiting and watching. The rich peasants have become poor, and the self-cultivating peasants are even poorer! When the communist army retreated, the people's vehicles, cattle and horses were all pulled away to transport materials, and less than half of them escaped. The grain was eaten, and the seeds became a problem. The agricultural tools were destroyed, or they have been used as fuel. Horse grass and feed are even more exhausted. After two lootings in northern Chahar, the cattle have disappeared. How can they cultivate with bare hands? Even if the grain harvested after all the hardships, who knows who will get it? In the end, they will still be unable to avoid hunger and starvation! The painful memories make people have to make bad plans. The farming season is missed. This problem is too serious, but the farmers have no way to live in front of them. What about the distant future? The hope of spring ploughing, like the previous years, can only be placed on government loans and relief.

Although the material life is extremely difficult, the people can still endure the minimum. The mental fear and panic is the threat to the lives of the people. In the places where the communist army haunts, the people dare not say what they want to say, dare not do what they want to do, "dare to hate but dare not speak" to the communist army, and want to be close to the national army but dare not express it clearly. They have truly lost the "four major freedoms." It seems that there is a terrible shadow following them, monitoring them, and preparing to accept the most unfortunate encounter at any time!

Today, what the people urgently need is the guarantee of life safety. They certainly hope that more national troops will be stationed in their towns and villages to protect them forever. But they are deeply afraid that once the national army leaves, the communist army will come back and re-do the meat on the chopping board. Therefore, they call on the government to issue weapons and arm themselves for self-defense. They need weapons more urgently than other relief materials. They would rather eat less and wear less, and also want to have weapons in their hands to defend their lives. The people are no longer willing to be brutally oppressed, and they are rising up to take forceful action.

The people living in the cities are still relatively stable, but the heavy pressure of life is also making people breathless. The destruction of the communist army has caused 90% of the factories to be closed. The enemy's nine years of operation was destroyed by the communist army overnight. Time, money, equipment, and stability are also important conditions for repatriation. The Longyan Iron Mine, which has 30,000 workers, now only has dozens of people guarding the broken walls and ruins and the broken machines! A large number of workers are unemployed, and relief is just a drop in the bucket. A series of social problems are happening. How can the income of public officials and teachers keep up with the soaring prices? The weakening of purchasing power, the stagnation of sales in rural areas, and the decline of commerce are all expected! If the border defense is a heavy town and a large army is gathered, the burden of firewood, housing, horse grass, and horse feed will be increased on the people invisibly. If they encounter undisciplined troops, they don't know how much trouble they will suffer.

This picture of misery is the epitome of the lives of the people of Chahar Province. The harsh reality is whipping the people. How can the people live in this evil flow of disaster and fear?

### Inside Story of the American Historical Association: Impressions from the Sixty-First Annual Meeting

— Li Dongfang

Not long ago in Washington, D.C., I met Mr. Solon J. Buck, the director of the American Language Collection. Unexpectedly, a few days later I encountered him again in New York as the treasurer of the American Historical Association, attending the sixty-first annual meeting in New York. The meeting lasted four days, from December 27th to 30th. The venue was the Pennsylvania Hotel.

The magnificent and luxurious hotel was filled with scholars from all directions. Many of these prolific scholars were over sixty years old, with youthful faces and white hair. They occupied the grand ballroom (fortunately not during dance hours) and several small lounges where private conversations could take place. The atmosphere was boisterous, resembling a joyous occasion or diplomatic reception rather than academic research. The younger members seemed more serious, carefully observing and secretly recording the casual conversations of their seniors. Several ladies, appearing to be both reporters and members, scurried around with notebooks, diligently recording everything they heard. Along the corridor, representatives from major bookstores sat in a long row, seemingly competing to display their published history books, undoubtedly reaping substantial profits. Among them, "Service of Bibliography," a business that seemed to be both a bookstore and not, stood out, showcasing antique books. Besides selling rare and out-of-print books, they also offered services such as transcribing books and finding research materials.

On the afternoon of the day before the conference, the board of directors held a meeting. In addition to the directors, four officers attended: the president, vice president, treasurer, and executive secretary cum editor of the association's journal. The structure of the board of directors is excellent, and I believe the Chinese Historical Association could emulate it. All past presidents serve as directors, with an additional eight elected directors serving four-year terms, two of whom are replaced each year.

The current president is Mr. Sidney B. Fay of Harvard University. The vice president is Mr. Thomas J. Wertenbaker of Princeton University, and the executive secretary is Mr. Guy Stanton Ford, who is stationed at the association. Among the directors is Mr. J. Salwyn Schapiro, a scholar known to many Chinese scholars, who now teaches at the City University of New York.

The president naturally gave an opening speech, but he was very polite, placing his formal lecture on the evening of the second day, titled "The Idea of Progress." To emphasize the progressive aspirations of historians, the first day's agenda began with "Freedom and Restraint." The chairman was Mr. W. L. Westernman of Columbia University. The three speakers were Issac Mendelcohn, who spoke on "Slavery and Serfdom in the Ancient Near East"; Carl Stephenson, who spoke on "The Main Characteristics of Medieval Serfdom"; and W. G. Zeefeld, who spoke on "Labor and Egalitarianism in the Sixteenth Century." All were excellent, representing the fruits of a year's labor. After each speaker, a designated "discussant" politely raised a few easily answerable questions.

Unfortunately, listeners couldn't be in multiple places at once. At the same time, in other rooms, there were also insightful discussions to be heard. Some were discussing "Russia's Search for a Seaport," others were discussing "French Constitutionalism," and still others were discussing "New Approaches to Local History." It was truly a shame.

During lunchtime, Mr. Hans Staehle was designated to speak on "New Discoveries Regarding the Economic and Social History of Prussia in the Early Nineteenth Century." Although the new discoveries were not numerous, they generated considerable interest. I thought that if all lectures could be widely disseminated to various universities, it would certainly increase the number of students choosing to study history.

In another dining room, I saw Mr. Buck chairing a session. A historian currently working for the Department of State spoke extensively on "International Documents and Their Preservation," and the acting director of the United Nations Archives reported on how he preserves the United Nations archives.

In the afternoon, the meetings continued, continuing, continuing to study the issue of "Freedom and Restraint." Mr. Eric Williams spoke on "Slavery and Indentured Labor Under Nineteenth-Century Imperialism"; Mr. Herbert Harris spoke on "Restrictions on Freedom in Today's World." Mr. Harris was unreserved in his criticism of restrictions of all kinds.

In the other three rooms, people were studying "France After Liberation," "England in the Late Middle Ages," and "Latin America." Who could be in multiple places at once?

At dinner in the evening, there were two more speakers. One spoke on "The Idea of the Magna Carta," which was unremarkable. The other spoke on "The Problem of Eating Meat Among Western Explorers," which was quite unique, especially since he was speaking when everyone had meat to eat.

Among the many lectures on the second day, the one that caught my attention most was Mr. John K. Fairbank's discussion on the research program for Far Eastern history. He reported on how he was guiding graduate students at Harvard University to conduct in-depth research on specialized topics related to Far Eastern history. Today, most universities in the United States have Far Eastern departments, but Harvard is one of the exceptions. Pomona College, near Los Angeles in southwestern United States, has the richest collection of books related to the Far East. Under the direction of the late Mr. Laufer, the University of Chicago also has a good foundation. The University of Pittsburgh and the University of Vermont, which recently established Far Eastern departments, are full of promise. Unfortunately, although San Francisco University and the University of Southern California also had Far Eastern departments, one was interrupted, and the other was greatly diminished due to the departure of the person in charge. As for the Chinese department at Columbia University, led by Mr. Goodrich, it is comparable to some of the best Chinese literature departments in China.

The third day was Sunday, so the morning session was adjourned. In the afternoon, there were still two speakers discussing the anti-clerical movement in France and Italy. After attending church in the morning, it was naturally not dry to listen to this topic in the afternoon.

On the fourth day, there were twenty-four speakers. Their meeting is unlike our usual meetings. Only with such extensive lectures can it be worthy of being an annual meeting of an academic organization. Otherwise, if it's just a banquet, an election, and some idle chatter, what academic content is there? We Chinese are too cautious. Those with good scholarship always "hide their abilities," unwilling to easily show them, and they are too concerned about face, unable to withstand others' "discussions." In fact, knowledge is a common asset of humanity. Your conclusions may not even be yours; aren't they derived from reconciling others' conclusions or evidence? When others refute or revise your conclusions, your contribution is already "immortal." Liu Bang may have gained the world, but Xiang Yu is also worthy of being a failed hero.

The highlight was the issue of the connection between secondary school history curricula and university history curricula. This issue is indeed very important. In addition to the connection between universities and secondary schools in China, there is also the connection between junior high schools and senior high schools. I hope that the Chinese Historical Association, under the leadership of Hu Shih, Gu Jiegang, Fu Sinian, Miao Fenglin, and Shen Gangbo, can hold more annual meetings. People's history is only two or three hundred years old, yet they have already held sixty-one annual meetings of the American Historical Association.

### Special Products with Artistic Value: A Look at the Past and Present of Fuzhou Lacquerware

— Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu, Fuzhou Telegraph Dispatch, 20th

Fuzhou's special product, lacquerware, has a history of over two hundred years and was sold throughout China, Southeast Asia, and Europe and America before the war. Those who have been to Fuzhou all praise the artistic value of Fuzhou lacquerware. The exquisite paintings and skillful craftsmanship are truly breathtaking! Shanghai is a major market for Fuzhou lacquerware. Almost every household, if decorated with a set of Fuzhou lacquerware, will appear radiant.

A Brief History of Bringing Glory to the Country

As early as the mid-Qing Dynasty, Shen Shaoan, a native of Fuzhou, discovered the method of making bodiless lacquerware during his apprenticeship. Later, he began to manufacture lightweight utensils such as bowls and boxes, which were appreciated by the gentry and common people of the time. Legend has it that Mr. Liu from Xiqiao ordered several washing bowls from Shen's workshop to be shipped back to his country. The ship capsized halfway, but the lacquerware, being lightweight, remained floating on the surface of the sea. A sailor from another ship picked them up, brought them back to America, and shared them with others, marking the beginning of Fuzhou lacquerware's sales overseas. During the Qing Dynasty, Shen Min brought his exquisite lacquerware to an industrial exhibition in Southeast Asia and received an honorary medal. The Qing government also awarded Shen a commercial title and a fourth-rank official hat, expressing its encouragement for the arts. Subsequently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a commercial certificate in the fourth year of the Republic of China, and honorary certificates were also received for participation in the Panama Fair in the tenth year of the Republic of China and the Shanghai National Industrial Exhibition in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, Shen's lacquerware was praised as an unparalleled work of art at the International Exposition in Chicago, USA, and won a first-class Flying Eagle Medal. Fuzhou lacquerware can truly be called the leader of the world's lacquerware industry, bringing glory to the country.

Manufacturing Techniques: Lifelike and Exquisite

Although Fujian does not produce lacquer, Fuzhou lacquerware is particularly famous. China's lacquer trees are mostly found in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. The lacquer used to make Fuzhou lacquerware is transported from Sichuan. Besides lacquer, other materials are needed, such as old Phoebe wood (because it is sturdy), silk cloth, and pigments like gold and silver powder and coral red. There are three types of manufacturing methods:

(1) Bodiless—First, a clay model is made, covered with thin silk cloth, and coated with lacquer liquid mixed with flour. A hole is left at the bottom. After it dries, it is polished with fine bricks to make it shiny. This process of applying lacquer and polishing is repeated more than twenty times over a period of eight months. When the lacquer mold is firm, it is soaked in water, which enters through the bottom hole, completely dissolving the clay model. The remaining clay is removed with a needle, leaving the lacquer body. It is then scraped clean, polished, and coated with gold powder and vibrant colors. It is lightweight and durable, and will not fade even after hundreds of years. This is considered finely made.

(2) Semi-Bodiless—A model is carved from old Phoebe wood, covered with thin silk cloth, and coated with lacquer fifteen times, taking half a year to complete. It is heavier in weight.

(3) Wood-Based—A model is carved from old Phoebe wood and coated with fading lacquer, which is specially formulated in Yongjia. It is coated with lacquer ten times, taking four months to complete. It is the heaviest in weight. This type of lacquerware does not change color for a long time. There are also miscellaneous lacquer shops that use pig's blood instead of lacquer to make lacquerware, which will change color within six months. This is not genuine Fuzhou lacquerware.

Most lacquerware is decorative, especially vases, cigarette boxes, and cake boxes. Sculptures of figures (including deities) and paintings of landscapes, flowers, and birds are also common, rendered with lifelike detail. The manufacturing techniques are ingenious. First, one needs sharp eyesight, a calm mind for composition, and delicate handling. The warm climate of southern China is also a favorable condition for making lacquerware. There are many secrets involved, which manufacturers are reluctant to share in detail.

Twenty Lacquerware Shops: A Lineage of Transmission

Shen Fu'an is the founder of the Fuzhou lacquerware industry, and generally, it is believed that Shen's lacquerware techniques are the most refined. In addition to the old brand of Shen Fu'an, there are currently about twenty lacquerware shops of various sizes in Fuzhou, with approximately three hundred technicians and workers. There are about fifty top-level technicians, who are said to be all descendants of the Shen lineage. The organization of lacquerware workshops is divided into six departments in terms of technology:

(1) Wood Department—Responsible for carving models. (2) Clay Department—Responsible for molding models. (3) Lacquer Department—Responsible for mixing and applying lacquer. (4) Painting Department—Responsible for painting. (5) Carving Department—Responsible for carving the lacquer surface. (6) Color Matching Department—Responsible for mixing various pigments such as gold, silver, and coral red.

Technicians must train for more than five years before they can start manufacturing. Currently, technicians work eight hours a day, and their wages range from 10,000 to 15,000 yuan.

Before the War of Resistance, their business was thriving and at its peak. After the war, due to the weak purchasing power of the general public, the inconvenience of transportation, and the difficulty of sourcing raw materials, it has gradually declined. It is said that the total sales of lacquerware in the Beijing and Shanghai areas last year were less than 100 million yuan. Business in Fuzhou is even more dismal, and the lives of ordinary people are extremely difficult. Who has the leisure to appreciate works of art? However, the manufacture of lacquerware still has its artistic and economic value. With a history of over two hundred years and a reputation at home and abroad, how can we bear to see the Fuzhou lacquerware industry gradually decline? If the government could provide production loans or support it financially through a public-private partnership to maintain its former prosperity and compete for the international markets of Southeast Asia and Europe and America, it might be a way to earn foreign exchange.

Spring and Autumn

### Truth Knows, God Knows, But Must Wait

— By Leo Tolstoy, Translated by Tian Zhongji

In the town of Vladimir lived a young merchant named Ivan Dmitrievich Aksionov. He had two shops and a house.

Aksionov was a handsome young man with curly fair hair, cheerful and fond of music. In his youth, he had been given to drink and was sometimes riotous when drunk, but after his marriage, he gave up the habit altogether, except for an occasional glass.

One summer, Aksionov was going to the Nizhny Fair, and as he bade farewell to his family, his wife said to him, "Ivan Dmitrievich, do not start today; I have had a bad dream about you."

Aksionov laughed and said, "You are afraid that when I get to the fair, I shall go on the spree."

His wife replied, "I do not know what I am afraid of; all I know is that I had a bad dream. I dreamt that you returned from the town, and when you took off your cap, I saw that your hair was quite grey."

Aksionov laughed. "That is a lucky sign," said he. "See if I do not sell all my goods and bring you some presents from the fair."

So he took leave of his family and started.

When he had travelled halfway, he met a merchant whom he knew, and they put up at the same inn for the night. They had some tea together, and then went to bed in adjoining rooms.

Aksionov was not in the habit of getting up late, and, wishing to travel while it was still cool, he aroused his servant early and told him to harness the horses.

Then he went to the landlord (who lived in the back yard) to pay his bill, and continued his journey.

When he had gone about twenty-five miles, he stopped to feed the horses. Aksionov rested for a while in the passage of the inn, then he went to the samovar and ordered some tea, and while he was drinking it, he took out his guitar and began to play.

Suddenly a troika drove up with tinkling bells, and an official alighted, followed by two soldiers. He came to Aksionov and began to question him, asking who he was and whence he came. Aksionov answered him fully, and said, "Won't you have some tea?" But the official went on cross-questioning him and asking him, "Where did you spend last night? Were you alone, or with a fellow-merchant? Did you see the other merchant this morning? Why did you leave the inn so early?"

Aksionov wondered why he was asked all these questions, but he described all that had happened, and then added, "Why do you cross-question me as if I were a thief or a robber? I am travelling on business of my own, and there is no need to question me."

Then the official called the soldiers and said, "I am the police officer of this district, and I have to question you because the merchant with whom you stayed last night has been murdered. We must search your things."

They entered the house and the soldiers and the police officer unpacked Aksionov's luggage and searched it. Suddenly the officer drew a knife from a bag, exclaiming, "Whose knife is this?"

Aksionov looked, and seeing a blood-stained knife taken from his bag, he was frightened.

"How is it there is blood on this knife?"

Aksionov tried to answer, but could hardly utter a word, and only stammered: "I—don't know—it must be—not mine."

Then the police officer said: "This morning the merchant was found in bed with his throat cut. You are the only one who could have done it. The house was locked from inside, and no one else was there. Here is this blood-stained knife in your bag, and your face and manner betray you! Tell me, how did you kill him, and how much money did you steal?"

Aksionov swore he had not done it and that he had not seen the merchant after they had had tea together; that he had no money except his own eight thousand rubles, and that the knife was not his. But his voice was broken, his face pale, and he trembled with fear as though he were guilty.

The police officer ordered the soldiers to bind Aksionov and to put him in the cart. As they tied him, Aksionov crossed himself and wept. His money and goods were taken from him, and he was sent to the nearest town and imprisoned there. Enquiry was made about Aksionov's character in Vladimir. The merchants and other inhabitants of that town said that in former days he had been given to drink and was fond of rioting but that since his marriage he had left off these habits and was a good man. Then the trial came on, he was charged with murdering a merchant from Ryazan and robbing him of twenty thousand rubles.

His wife was crushed, not knowing whether to believe it or not. All her children were quite small; one was still at her breast. She took them all with her, and went to the town where her husband was in jail. At first, she was not allowed to see him, but after much begging, she obtained permission from the officials and was led to him. When she saw her husband in prison clothes, chained and shaved, among criminals and hardened convicts, she fell down, and did not come to her senses for a long time. Then she drew her children to her, and sat down near him. She told him of things at home, and asked about what had happened to him. He told her everything. She asked, "What can we do now?"

"We must petition the Czar not to let an innocent man perish."

His wife told him that she had petitioned the Czar, but her petition had not been granted.

Aksionov did not reply, but only looked down cast.

Then his wife said, "It was not for nothing I had that bad dream. You remember? You should not have started that day." And seizing hold of his hand, she said, "Tell me the truth: Was it you who did it?"

Aksionov exclaimed, "You, too, suspect me!" and, hiding his face in his hands, began to weep. Then a jailer came and said that the wife and children must go away; and Aksionov said good-bye to his family for the last time.

When they were gone, Aksionov recalled what his wife had said, and when he remembered that she also suspected him, he said to himself, "It seems that only God can know the truth; it is to Him alone I must appeal, and from Him alone expect mercy."

And Aksionov wrote no more petitions; gave up all hope, and only prayed to God.

Aksionov was condemned to be flogged and sent to the mines. He was flogged with the knout, and when the wounds were healed, he was sent to Siberia with other convicts.

Aksionov lived as a convict in Siberia for twenty-six years. His hair turned quite white, and his beard grew long, thin, and grey. All his mirth went; he stooped; he walked slowly, spoke little, and never laughed, but he often prayed.

In prison Aksionov learned to make boots, and earned a little money, with which he bought the "Acts of the Apostles." He read it when there was light enough in the prison; and on Sundays in the prison church he read the lessons and sang in the choir, for his voice was still good. The prison officials liked Aksionov for his meekness, and his fellow prisoners respected him; they called him "Grandfather," and "The Saint." When they wanted to petition the prison officials about anything, they always made Aksionov their spokesman, and when quarrels occurred among them, they appealed to him to judge and settle the matter.

No news reached Aksionov from his home; he did not even know if his wife and children were still alive.

One day a fresh gang of convicts came to the prison. In the evening the old prisoners collected round the new ones and asked them what towns they came from, and what they were sentenced for. Among the rest Aksionov sat down near the new comers, and listened dejectedly.

One of the new convicts, a tall, strong old man of about sixty, with a closely cropped grey beard, was relating why he had been arrested.

"Well, friends," he said, "I only took a horse that was tied to a sledge, and was arrested and accused of stealing. I said I had only taken it to get home quicker, and had meant to return it soon. And so it was; I said, 'It's all right, the owner will find it soon enough.' But they said, 'No, you stole it.' But I'll tell you what—I've been where I was before, and I didn't intend to stick to this here. I've been in Siberia before, but I didn't stay long."

### Mother and Child (Woodcut)

— Wu Junfa

### My Grievances

— Hu Shanyuan

In the past, I was the most skilled at complaining. The reason for this, of course, had seemingly unavoidable causes: First, I was "born at the wrong time," and my family was exceptionally poor; second, in school, my grades were consistently better than others, leading to arrogance; third, my emotions were easily stirred; and fourth, I just happened to love literature. These were all internal reasons, stemming from my own being. Originally, these reasons wouldn't necessarily become the driving force behind my complaints, if there were no external reasons to rub against them. However, external reasons relentlessly exerted their power, causing me to falter, and I could only embark on a life filled with complaints.

What were these external reasons? First, snobbery, which looks down on poor children; second, what society needs is fundamentally different from what schools need—the inferior students in school are often the tycoons of society, while the superior students, especially those with integrity who refuse to yield or compromise, only encounter setbacks everywhere; third, society needs those who are confident and composed, never revealing their true colors—the more fake, the better; fourth, literature has no way out, or rather, it has no way out in contemporary China. These external factors, like a great furnace, burned me, burning me to the point where I almost had no place to exist, so I could only complain, attaching myself to the ranks of men of letters, and like other men of letters throughout history, using it as a way to console myself.

So I sighed. Upon seeing a close old friend, I was like a lost child seeing its mother, pouring out a string of grievances. Some old friends still had old feelings and always comforted me; those with the ability even helped to improve my situation somewhat. However, such old friends were very few, so few that they were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. What about most old friends? The more agreeable ones would remain silent, frowning and lowering their heads, fulfilling their obligation to listen, waiting until I had finished complaining before offering a few perfunctory words; those who lacked patience and had long forgotten the friendship would either blame me for my lack of social skills or "speak of other things," not wanting to listen. If I continued to nag, they would say, "I have some things to do; let's talk another day," thus ending my complaints. Fortunately, I only complained in front of old friends; I don't know what kind of unbearable situation I would be put in if I complained in front of new friends!

Naturally, I also cursed. I cursed corrupt officials; I hated profiteering merchants; I cursed ingrates; I cursed shameless people; I cursed dissolute people; I cursed pedantic people; I cursed any bad people; I cursed old habits, evil forces; I cursed imperialism and feudalism; I cursed any harmful things. I cursed indiscriminately, cursing regardless of the time or place, and even more so, cursing without choosing people—only cursing in front of people who sympathized with me. Cursing felt good, which meant complaining felt good.

Fortunately, my complaining didn't reach the point of madness, so I wouldn't resort to hitting people, nor would I cry or sing for no reason. This may be due to my normal lifestyle, with absolutely no vices, so I can still maintain the balance of my mind and brain. However, I struggled and resisted, and the resentful spirit of a skin-deep complaint was never exhausted—extremely bitter, extremely bitter!

I cannot but thank the War of Resistance Against Japan, for it rescued me from the snare of complaining, and I have never complained since. As soon as the war broke out, I felt that all personal matters should be put aside; otherwise, without one's own country, there would be no society, no family, so what personal matters could one have! And danger was like a sword hanging over one's head, with the possibility of a violent death every day, so what was there to complain about! During the eight years of the war, this feeling of mine became clearer and clearer, turning into a force for regeneration, no longer trapped by complaints.

Because of the war, I saw all kinds of changes and confirmed that the teachings I received in school and church when I was young were true: Only by forgetting oneself for the sake of others can one find true happiness!

Now, the environment has not improved, and what I am enduring is not necessarily easier to endure than before the war. But I no longer complain, simply because I have learned to forget myself and serve others.

Pitiful men of letters, especially those who are skilled at complaining, must be numerous, right? What do you think of my words? I don't want to boast, and there is nothing to boast about anyway; I just want to make some contribution to you: please, don't complain.

### Recommendations for Newcomers—A Report on Literary and Artistic Work

The "Literary and Artistic Spring and Autumn," Volume 4, Issue 3 (to be published on the 15th of next month), launched a "Symposium on the Issue of Recommending Newcomers." As a result, as many as seventeen writers participated. What we are particularly grateful for are those writers from other cities, such as Duanmu Yiliang from Hankou, Lin Huanping from Hong Kong, SY from Chengdu, Tian Tao from Wanxian, Sichuan, Xu Chi from Wuxing Nanxun, and Zhong Jingwen from Guangzhou. They all wrote their manuscripts from distant cities and sent them to us by express mail. This kind of work, which does not shrink from complexity and fatigue in order to cultivate new literary and artistic talents, truly made us feel unparalleled joy when we received the manuscripts one after another.

Regarding this symposium on the issue of recommending newcomers, we sent letters to various writers in advance. The original text of the letter was as follows: Mr. ×××,

If the field of literature and art is similar to the field of fruit trees, then the harvest of flowers and fruits requires the continuous cultivation of diligent gardeners. Since the May Fourth Movement, the life of Chinese new literature and art has had several decades of history. In this period, which is neither lengthy nor too short, the rise and fall of batches of writers has given us a valuable lesson: In order to cultivate the field of literature and art, in order to create beautiful flowers and fruits, it is not enough to rely solely on the efforts of old gardeners; we obviously need the cooperation of new gardeners, need to irrigate new blood, and need to enrich new strength. Since its publication, this journal has never neglected the work of discovering newcomers, but because of space limitations, it has not been able to fully accommodate them. Now, it has been decided to publish the works of newcomers in their entirety in Volume 4, Issue 3, in an attempt to introduce them on a large scale. Before the editing and printing of this "Newcomer Recommendation Issue," we would like to solicit your opinions on eight issues regarding the discovery of newcomers, in order to compile and publish them for readers and authors to study. We have always admired your enthusiasm for the cultivation of Chinese new literature and art, and especially your dedication to the recommendation and introduction of new authors. Therefore, we dare to write to you and request that you provide a reply by February 20th and submit it to our office at No. 380 Fuzhou Road in this city. We would be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Literary and Artistic Spring and Autumn Monthly Journal. Enclosed with the above letter were the following eight questions:

(1) What attitude should the editors of journals and literary supplements adopt when dealing with the works of newcomers (whether excellent works or immature works)?

(2) Based on your personal editing experience in the past, what difficulties have you felt in reading and introducing manuscripts from outside, and what methods can be used to overcome these difficulties?

(3) Why is the work of discovering and cultivating newcomers so necessary in the process of literary and artistic growth? According to what literary and artistic theory can this principle be explained?

(4) Generally speaking, an ideal introduction would be to publish the works of newcomers along with the after-reading opinions of veteran writers. However, would such a method limit the understanding of the works themselves to some extent? Is it truly beneficial to the authors? Are there other better and more effective methods of recommendation?

(5) Due to the scarcity of purely literary journals and supplements at present, it is very difficult to accommodate a large number of new works. What methods can be used to overcome this difficulty?

(6) If the editors of several major journals and supplements were to jointly organize a communication mechanism dedicated to introducing the works of newcomers, and with the support of veteran writers, send works of above-average quality to veteran writers for reading, and then send them to newspapers and magazines for publication after writing their reading opinions, or even publish a "Joint Publication," or have our company publish a "Special Issue" separately—is such an organizational mechanism appropriate? What are the difficulties? Are there any other better methods?

(7) If there is an urgent need for the above-mentioned mechanism to exist, then our company is willing to take the lead in organizing such a mechanism. But we do not know if you are willing to take on the work of reviewing. If you are willing, which department of works would you like to read? How many articles (how many words) can you read each month?

(8) When a specific plan for discovering newcomers can be realized, we plan to donate 30% to 40% of the royalties for the works of newcomers to the readers who review and correct them. Is this method appropriate? Is the remuneration too high or too low? After receiving the above-mentioned letters, the writers successively sent in their manuscripts. Except for Mr. Luo Hong, who sent a letter humbly stating that he could not answer, and Mr. Wang Xiyan from Fuzhou, who claimed that it was too late to publish, the local writers published approximately: Kong Lingjing, Wu Tian, Lin Danqiu, Shi Cun, Xu Diaoshou, Guo Shaochu, Xu Jie, Xin Yi, Zhao Jingshen, Liu Beifan, and Mr. Shi Yi. Among them, Mr. Ye Shengtao's article was already decided to be independent when the manuscript was being drafted, so Mr. Ye's article was written in the form of an essay, titled "A Decent Work."

Combining the opinions of the above-mentioned ten or so writers, although there are slight differences, they can be summarized into the following principles: (1) They all have great enthusiasm for the recommendation and cultivation of newcomers; (2) They hope to be able to organize a communication mechanism dedicated to cultivating newcomers, so that the works of newcomers have a large number of outlets; (3) When necessary, they are all willing to read the works of newcomers.

Now we are working with several related friends to organize a "Literary and Artistic News Agency," which will not only introduce the works of newcomers, but also introduce the works of veteran writers to distant cities. We hope that our efforts will especially benefit new writers.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 188

— Ye Jingfeng

It's indeed a bit risky that only Yaoqun and Little Hucheng are prepared to go to Dongjiaomin Lane to spy on Pingzi (this is the assumed goal) because we have no report on the other side, and we don't know what's really going on. The Art of War says, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." Here, we are missing the condition of "knowing the enemy," so how can it not be considered risky? To put it strictly, this is a kind of "reckless action." Even if we don't cause a big disaster, I'm afraid we can't avoid a small failure.

Isn't Yaoqun's adventure a kind of "know the enemy" bald-headed action? If we want to "know the enemy," someone must go and explore first, right? But that's not the case. The work of exploration is done by people who specialize in exploration, and there are plans and steps, but we can't let Yaoqun do it. According to our method, we must send a small line to operate. Although small lines are not important figures, and their work is not considered major, they are feelers. Without a detailed report from the feelers, if we want to take action, that is blind advancement. Espionage work cannot be done blindly. Blind advancement is dangerous.

From this, we know that Hejian thinks it is dangerous because he is afraid that there may be enemies mixed in with this secret agency, and the person in charge is still kept in the dark.

After Hejian said the word "dangerous," I paid close attention to the expressions of Mr. Dai, Mr. W, and the manager. At this time, I only saw Mr. Dai glance at Mr. W intentionally or unintentionally, with a very clear "?" symbol in his eyes. And Mr. W quickly transmitted this symbol to the manager with his eyes. Just as the transmitted look touched the manager, the answer was already obtained on the manager's expression at the same time. This expression was just a slight shake of the head—a kind of strong self-confidence, indicating that Hejian's so-called danger was somewhat of an overestimation; there were no enemy agents infiltrated here.

"Do you have any discoveries?" Mr. W asked Hejian after getting the manager's expression of confidence.

"It seems like there is a little bit..." Hejian left his seat and slowly walked to the window. He turned around and leaned his back against the wall, attracting the attention of the room. "When I came back here, just as I was about to go home, a very luxurious car was in front of me, about fifty yards away. It stopped at our gate. A woman got out of the car, and in the blink of an eye, she took three steps and entered the gate here. By the time my car arrived at the gate, that car had already driven thirty or forty yards away, and I couldn't even see the license plate clearly."

"Was that woman tall, with a very slender figure?" Yaoqun asked, seemingly having seen something.

"Appearance, actions, somewhat resemble someone I knew in Japan!" Hejian seemed not to have heard Yaoqun's words, only focusing his eyes on the floor in front of his feet, thinking deeply, seemingly recalling a past fragment. After thinking for a while, he suddenly raised his head and looked at Yaoqun, stunned for a while, as if he had just cut off his memory and realized Yaoqun's question:

"Yes, Miss Yao, … slender is slender, but not too tall," Hejian replied to Yaoqun, and then looked at us again, "When I got out of the car and rushed to the hall, there was no trace of her. I couldn't bother the duties of the hall, and I couldn't ask about the elevator..."

Hearing this, I felt somewhat aware. Hejian said that this person was someone he knew in Japan. I guess that this person is very likely Pingzi; she must have been tracking Hejian.

"About ten minutes since this lady came in?" The manager opened the handbook.

Hejian looked at his watch and nodded.

"Korean woman," the manager read the record on the booklet: "About twenty-four or five years old, surnamed Li, named Jinzi, related to the Korean 'Great League of the Han Nation'," reading this, he looked up at Mr. W again, seemingly getting Mr. W's consent, before turning to Guan Jian, "On the third floor, there is a Korean 'Great League' cadre living here, Mr. Liu Ping. He unfortunately damaged his eyes in a violent action... It's a pity!"

### Mountain Dwelling Grass—Random Notes on Wind and Snow

— Hu Mu

1.  Wild Valley

Oh, how cold and dark is this mountain valley!

I am a childish shepherd, every day, I smell the scent of decaying grass in the mountains and fields. Taking advantage of the morning glow, I go out, and when dusk is sparse, I blow the flute of life's harvest, leading the flock back.

I deeply love this silent winter wild valley... Although, I am a bit cold, but the wilderness is a silver white, you say how bright and how solemn white it is!

I deeply love this continuous winter wild valley, because the soil here nourished me to grow up.

I hope, when will the wild valley be filled with smiling flowers. I hope when will there be hearty songs in the wild valley...

2.  Watchtower

Standing alone in the barren mountains, like a humble old man in rags, oh watchtower.

Wild grass is your green emerald skirt, white clouds are your gorgeous canopy, and flowers are your decorations:

I stand by the watchtower in the dusk, thinking for a long time. I remotely think of the heroes on the galloping battlefield in the past.

Towards the distance, I broadcast praises to the knights.

3.  Earthen House

The small earthen house is whipped and beaten by the wind, snow, and rain…

I live in the small earthen house with a heart full of tears and suffering, and I miss the days of flowering.

But, I still love this haven of life, and I will never give up my beloved small earthen house!

### A Spring Dream—Self-Funded Students

— Yang Mou

In July of last year, the government held a public examination for self-funded students to study abroad. Many people prepared their troops and horses, hoping for a smooth journey, to be named on the gold list, so that they could go abroad for a stroll. Then, they could return to their motherland and show off their skills.

At that time, the exchange rate for US dollars was 2020 yuan. According to many people's calculations, even if they couldn't get a government scholarship, they could study in the United States at their own expense. If they prepared to study for two years, enduring hardship and hard work, $3,000 US dollars could barely support them. That is to say, they only needed to prepare 6 million yuan to study abroad. Of course, this idea is not wrong. People with money don't need to plan everything, but those who study hard must plan.

With great difficulty, they went through a lot of procedures for physical examinations and registration. They also passed the exam with great difficulty. However, this "gold list" was late in coming. It was not published until the end of October, after the US dollar exchange rate was adjusted to 3350 yuan. Of course, the government-funded students were eagerly waiting to go abroad, but the self-funded students had already added more than half of the expenses out of thin air. The people who were preparing to study abroad were not all people who had many US dollars stored at home. Many of them were diligently saving their work salaries. Now, if they want to study abroad, they have to prepare at least 10 million yuan of national currency.

Their names are on the gold list, but both government-funded and self-funded students are still stuck in the country. The government wants the self-funded students to first submit their university certificates from foreign schools before issuing passports to them. They are like orphans, and no one cares for them. Of course, they cannot submit their university certificates for a while, so they cannot leave the country. As for the government-funded students, it is probably because the government is busy with public affairs. It seems that since they have benefited from the government, it is okay to waste some time. It was not until recently that the government issued a notice to gather for training in Nanjing next month. As for when they will go abroad and what schools they will enter, that is still anyone's guess.

However, the exchange rate has already been adjusted to 12,000 yuan. Apart from the children of profiteers and war profiteers in the United States, who can have such a large amount of money to study abroad? The self-funded students petitioned the Central Bank, but there was no follow-up. They petitioned the Ministry of Education, but there was no follow-up.

However, a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came: "By order, the issuance of passports for all government-funded and self-funded students studying abroad is temporarily suspended." It was casually dismissed with a stroke of the pen.

Half a year has passed, and everything has become a bubble. Since the government does not want anyone to study abroad, why teach so many people to waste time and wait in vain? Are the students really being used as sacrifices to decorate the facade?

Free Talk

### "Apply What You Learn"

— Gao Wuhong

Allow Traitors to Substitute Translations for Assignments

Knowledge and personality, morality, are absolutely two different things. Just as many people's words and actions cannot be consistent, a person with profound knowledge often has a personality and morality that are the opposite. An elder with a noble personality and admirable morality may not necessarily have good knowledge. To measure a person's personality and morality with knowledge, or to measure a person's knowledge with personality and morality, will disappoint you. Knowledge, personality, and morality cannot be weighed on the same scale, although there are exceptions, but these exceptions are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

Since ancient times, traitors who have lost their integrity and betrayed their country, selling their country for glory, have mostly had good knowledge. "Only intelligent people will make big mistakes and commit big crimes." Their actions are precisely a betrayal of their full of talent. Among the traitors, there are also many talented and knowledgeable people, such as Zhou Zuoren, Zhou Fohai, and Liang Hongzhi. Many people feel sorry for them, but the crimes they committed are difficult to wash away even with the water of the West River. This is also the result of "knowledge not being used properly," a definite proof that knowledge and personality and morality cannot be mentioned in the same breath.

According to reports: In the High Court Detention Center of this city, there are many traitors who have received higher education and are proficient in foreign languages. The court has now set up separate venues in the prison, allowing them to substitute translations for other assignments, and assigning them writing, translation, and proofreading work according to their academic qualifications and expertise.

In the past, the traitors used their knowledge improperly and "slipped up into eternal regret," having a big dream. After waking up from the dream, they were imprisoned. After "thinking about their mistakes in prison," they thought it was a pity to abandon their talents. So they wanted to take advantage of their prison years to show their strengths. They actually invited the authorities to approve, so that they could be worry-free and concentrate on writing in the venues specially set up for them in the prison, burying themselves in their desks and concentrating on writing, in order to relieve the long prison life.

In that kind of environment, engaging in translation and other work, thinking about it from the perspective of the traitors, this situation is really embarrassing. If they had been able to make good use of their knowledge earlier and behaved well, how could they be where they are today!

The traitors who are in shackles are doing the work of "applying what they have learned." I wonder what countless people in society who "use their knowledge improperly" will think when they hear this. Is it shame? Or is it vigilance?

"Poverty makes writers work harder." How should we say that the traitors are "working hard" to write articles in prison?

### Thinking of Home—Written After the "No Burial Place" News

— Wailing Poor Ghosts

Living is pitiful, dying is miserable, no place to live, no coffin to die; even more, no place to bury bones, how good it was to be buried in the soil in those years

Delaying cremation, is it empty talk? Who knows that life and death after victory are difficult? The big shots frown: Be careful of bad luck in June

Note: The cost of a coffin is definitely not something a poor family can buy. "Peace in the grave" is a joke about entering air-raid shelters during air raids. Someone jokingly replied "act according to the situation."

### Unable to Survive

— Meng Ping

In a small room, three people live: Chen, Zhou, and Li. Chen is a student studying abroad, and Zhou and Li are both college students. One works in the tax bureau, and the other is a newspaper reporter. One is a university professor. During the day, they all work outside. At 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening, for the sake of sleep, they involuntarily gather together. Besides reading books and newspapers, they start "pure conversation."

There is no fixed goal for pure conversation: the gold case, the corruption case, the Liang Renda case, the Lunan battle, Fu Sinian's big cannon, the freezing of the living index, the rising prices of daily necessities, Wang Yunwu's talk about promoting policies regardless of results, the Soviet Union letting the United States take over the Japanese Pacific islands, foreign affairs, domestic news, family economy, personal life, nothing is not talked about. The content of the conversation includes politics, economics, law, culture, society, and science. At times, except for the three people, there is no fourth person nearby. They speak freely and discuss the world, which is quite in line with the "freedom of speech" in the constitution and the "democratic" principles of democratic countries.

The three people's monthly salaries are all around 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Mr. Zhou is not yet married, but he has to bear the tuition fees of his fiancée. No matter how simple the wedding ceremony is, it always requires a sum of start-up money. If his wife has one or two children after marriage and there is no one to take care of them, he will have to hire a maid, which is a huge expense. In today's world, where the cost of living is rising day by day, he can only sigh and shout "unable to marry." Mr. Li's family is not in Shanghai, and the cost of eating "guest meals" is huge, coupled with social obligations, he shouts "unable to maintain." Mr. Chen has the burden of seven people, including his parents, wife, and children. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all concentrated on him. He struggles hard and says: "When you are not satisfied with your work, you can resign, but there is only one 'head of household' that cannot be resigned. You cannot sell your wife, and you cannot dismiss your children. You have to bite the bullet and live by pawning things, sighing 'unable to survive'."

The result of the pure conversation is inconclusive. Scholars rebelling are not feared by others; suicide lacks courage. Everyone sighs "unable to survive."

### "Tarzan" is Old

— Guo Hua

"Tarzan's Desert Victory," which is showing in the big Shanghai, is a hodgepodge put together from many things. It has Nazi spies, monsters, a little swimming and rope work, and strings them together into a story, which naturally gives a stale feeling. Tarzan's age may not have increased by many years, but the spirit of the Tarzan films is already old. In terms of attracting audiences, it has become a spent arrow, because it has made no progress in any aspect. Perhaps the only improvement is that the little chimpanzee Cheeta can do somersaults on the rope.

The female lead, Maureen O'Sullivan, when comforting Little Tarzan during prayers and in a few other scenes when she hears that Tarzan has a sweetheart in America, has some redeeming expressions. The rest is very forced. Tarzan himself, of course, cannot be said to be acting; he is just a strongman.

### Arts and Literary Scene

The sixth volume, fourth issue of "New Music Monthly" has been published, containing compositions by Schumann, Hua, and Dupa, and papers by Xue Geng, Huang Ning, and others. It is very suitable for general choral groups and schools to use as teaching materials. It is sold through Xuelin Bookstore, and each copy is sold for only one thousand yuan.

The Conservatory of Music is scheduled to perform Li Ling and Wen Gang's collaborative "Two Happy Dance" at the Youzhuan on March 9. This piece was previously performed once at the Guanghua Theater and was well received by the audience. Now it has been supplemented and is expected to be even more complete.

The Music Training Course sponsored by the Music Art Research Association is scheduled to begin on March 8, and is very suitable for general amateur musicians to study.

Modern young female writer Han Anyi will hold a Western painting exhibition at the Daxin Company Book General Store on Nanjing Road for a week starting from March 3. All are welcome to visit, and admission is free.

Anonymous's latest masterpiece "Beast, Beast, Beast" first edition and the sixth edition of "Arctic Scenery Painting" were published in January of this year. Within a month, they were snapped up by readers. The second edition of "Beast," the seventh edition of "Arctic," and the seventh edition of "Woman in the Tower" will be published successively this month. In addition, the eighth edition of "Arctic" will soon be published by Qingniao Publishing.

### Skill Seen in Difficulty – New Talk on Couplets, No. 6

— Ting Song

A professor at Fu Jen Catholic University is a madman. He always speaks grandiosely and writes voluminously, always saying that there are no difficult problems in the world. One day, a female student earnestly requested a couplet. The professor laughed and said, "There is no such format. The female student's words are about trying to persuade her sister's husband through her younger sister." Those sitting with him discussed it and said, "Brother, you have a difficult problem today." The professor bravely said, "What difficulty is there? But there must be facts." The female student said, "Her father and her sister's husband are both professors at Fu Jen Catholic University and get along well. Therefore, they are bonded by marriage. The son-in-law lives with his father-in-law. After the incident, the father-in-law stayed at the school, but the son-in-law lost his job. Life became more and more expensive. He was old, and the father-in-law's family burden was also heavy. He often said to people, 'It is already an exception that I support my married daughter and grandson. To also support an unemployed son-in-law is beyond my ability.' The son-in-law heard this and angrily left for the rear in Guangxi Province, where he obtained a position at the Guangxi Provincial University. He went last winter and died this autumn. Moreover, the sister gave birth to two children after her marriage, one boy and one girl. These are the facts. Can you use them?" The professor immediately picked up his pen and wrote a couplet, which read: "The deceased has long gone, and I grieve that my sister endures hardship and bitterness, still burdening her gray-haired old father; life is like a bubble, I hate that her weak body is kind-hearted but lacks strength, making it difficult to help her orphaned children." He told the female student, "Aunt and brother-in-law are like sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law who do not communicate, so there is no format for persuasion. If the meaning is to mourn the sister, then it is not difficult to mourn her husband." Everyone present was very admiring. The next day, the female student came with her middle sister, requesting another couplet, because the female students were three sisters, mourning the deceased, who was their eldest sister. The professor said that the facts had been exhausted and he could not write another one, and refused. The female students insisted and said, "My sister's husband died in Guangxi, and the previous couplet was sought there." The professor, without thinking, wrote another couplet, which read: "Thousands of miles of bad news flew in, I grieve that my sister is widowed and alone, with infinite sorrow filling my sister's chest; one hundred years of time pass easily, I hope that her two nephews will soar like mosquitoes and rise like phoenixes, and be able to establish themselves early and comfort their parents." The previous couplet used idioms and was very superb. This couplet is even more sincere in mourning the sister, and the phoenix and dragon are paired with "sister's chest" and "parents' heart," the antithesis is appropriate. It can be said that it is all perfect, coming easily. I said that both couplets are natural and generous, which is really not easy. It belongs to skill seen in difficulty, and the matter is also very interesting. Even now, thinking of it, I still can't help but laugh.

### What is the Benefit of Much Wealth? - Occasional Thoughts on Reading History

— Yang Ren

Occasionally reading the History of the Ming Dynasty, during the Jia Shen Incident, "An order was given to register the meritorious relatives, to collect contributions to the military pay. The eunuch Xu Gao was dispatched, and he argued that the Duke of Jiading, Zhou Kui, should take the lead. Kui declined, saying he had nothing. Gao wept and advised him again and again, but Kui responded with vague words. Gao angrily stood up and said: 'The in-laws of the emperor are like this, the country is finished! What is the benefit of much wealth?'" "The eunuch Wang Zhi Xin was the richest, and the emperor ordered him to only offer ten thousand gold. All the eunuchs wrote in large letters on their doors: 'This house is for sale urgently.'"

We see: as relatives of the imperial family and close ministers of the emperor, when the country's situation was critically urgent, they did not understand the principle of "when the country falls, the family is not safe," and only guarded their money like dogs gnawing bones, unwilling to take out a little to supplement the military pay and save the country; not only were they unwilling, but they also pretended to be poor by using "This house is for sale urgently" as a guise. These people were blinded by greed, lost their minds, and it is really hateful, infuriating, and laughable.

Therefore, it also makes me think of the misers who love money like their lives. They store their excess money in warehouses, letting it sit in the "cold palace," unwilling to contribute a little to the national economy and people's livelihood. In this way, what difference does it make whether that money is yours or not yours? What relationship does that money have with you? It only buries its useful purpose, and even harms the country and the people.

If we say that the insatiable greed of misers is nothing more than to have a happy life and teach their descendants, then there are many people whose wealth is already immeasurable, and even if they live extravagantly and luxuriously for thousands of years, they will still not be able to use it all up, yet they still desperately "absorb" it. Why?

If we say it is for the sake of leaving an inheritance for their descendants, then I must bring up a few old historical words: Li Guang of the Han Dynasty said it well: if descendants are "virtuous and wealthy, it will harm their ambition; if they are foolish and wealthy, it will increase their mistakes." Leaving wealth to one's descendants is far不如积点功德為好。better than accumulating some merit for one's descendants.

What is the benefit of much wealth? Those in the world who have a "money fetish" can see through a little, right?

### Qin Yi in Ying Yunwei's Directing "No Name"

### On Friendship

— Xue Hua

I have had many close friends, they are just like the air I must breathe every day, it relieves you of many mental and physical pains that come upon you; therefore, every time I think of friends, I am always moved to tears.

People cannot live in isolation! People must live a communal life. And friends are the most regular, warmest, and most human symbol of these community activities.

However, friendship often deteriorates with the turbulence of social life; their evaluation of you, due to the impact of various aspects, often makes them very cold, very sophisticated, and very "realistic." All interactions seem like merchants doing "business," measuring the importance of friendship with you in a "transactional" way.

When he has a request of you, he only revolves around you, emitting an instinctive "um-um-" sound, flattering, tactful, low, and kind, telling you his request; so, you are moved by him, "your whole body is moved," ah! Friendship should be cherished!

But the evolution of climate and weather cannot compare to the speed of change of these "gentle and low voices," they can freeze from high heat into ice.

They will weave a net around you, drawing a deep, bottomless chasm. Once you have a request of him, he will coldly shake his head at you and say:

"There's no way!"

In this "cold" "temperature," I often feel that I have frozen into "ice." "Obey the law"

"Obey the law" I forget my people.

### Chronicle of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

As he was about to approach the middle-aged man, he clenched his right fist and hammered his back and waist a few times.

"It seems that we young people can't do it!" A bitter smile appeared on his face, but he still looked very handsome. "Mr. Tian, you are really getting stronger as you get older!"

Mr. Tian smiled slightly, but his eyes kept looking around.

"What's wrong? Old Zhu is gone!" He looked very puzzled.

"Isn't it? Everyone else is busy, but he insisted on going out to find someone..." The person with the high nose and curly hair quickly guessed what was on the other's mind. "Mr. Tian, you're looking for him to rehearse the living newspaper for tomorrow, right?"

"Isn't that right? Miss Zhu and the others are all waiting downstairs!" Mr. Tian frowned, turned around, moved his legs wearing high-top boots, and walked towards the staircase, muttering to himself, "Old Zhu is enthusiastic, just a bit messy!..." After a few steps, he suddenly stopped as if he had remembered something, turned around, and asked loudly, "Where did Old Zhu go just now? The script is still with him!"

"He went to find Xu... Xu Shaoming." The person with the curly hair seemed to have some difficulty saying it.

The person in military uniform obviously did not understand what he was talking about.

"Xu Shaoming? The general manager of Zhongfu..." He began to think.

Among the dozen or so people counting money, a short man with an exceptionally unsmiling face walked out.

"Tian Guangsheng, the script is here. Old Zhu left it for you!" He walked towards a bamboo bookcase in the corner of the room, opened the door, and took out a roll of mimeographed material. His left leg was a bit lame, and his body swayed a lot when he walked, but he wasn't slow. Others looked like he was having some difficulty. He handed the script to Mr. Tian and immediately limped back to the big table to continue helping everyone count money; he seemed completely uninterested in other things.

Mr. Tian took the script and looked at the paper wrapped around it, and his heart was happy again.

"I don't think Old Zhu would be that confused!" He walked towards the staircase again. "He went to Xu Shaoming to donate money, leaving a note telling me to only give him a part in the play."

The sound of high-top boots echoed up and down the stairs.

"Mr. Tian likes Old Zhu, who is a real monster!" The person with the high nose and curly hair showed a displeased expression, retreated from the door again, and said to a person counting money standing near him, "Old Li, are you almost done? Let's go eat first!"

Old Li obviously had the same idea.

"Sorry, these stacks of mine are all five thousand yuan, you guys total them up! I'll leave with Old Zhong first!" He pushed the four or five stacks of banknotes tied together with rubber bands to the person next to him, wiped his hands on his trousers, and turned to follow Old Zhong and left.

"Dinner will be served here soon! Are you still leaving?" Three or four people asked them from behind.

"Going home to eat!" Old Zhong answered vaguely, without turning his head, and the two of them quickly went downstairs.

"Can Old Zhong eat here? Alas! He's in the boss class!" The short man with a worried face said in a sarcastic tone. In the middle, he inexplicably let out a long sigh.

"He was definitely very tired from shouting today, maybe he just wants to go back to rest." Someone gave this explanation for Old Zhong. (2)
