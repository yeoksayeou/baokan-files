Strong reinforcements of the National Army were airlifted from Qingdao to Jinan on the 27th. The situation outside Jinan has already improved. The National Army forces in Weixian and Jinan are currently encircling and annihilating Yidu from the east and west. The National Army forces in Zou County continued their relentless pursuit of the Communist forces retreating towards Qufu on the 27th, reaching the outskirts of the city in the afternoon, and Qufu is expected to be recovered soon. Military sources stated that the remnants of Chen Yi's Communist forces, who broke through to the northern foot of the Yimeng Mountains, are now trapped in a large National Army encirclement and will be easily annihilated.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 27th Dispatch] Fierce fighting continues around Jinan.

### Situation in Western Henan Suddenly Tense, National Army in Shanxi Recovers Fujiatang Coal Mine

[Our Newspaper, Kaifeng, 27th Dispatch] Following the great battle in eastern Henan, the situation in western Henan suddenly became critical. According to people coming from Shanxian, the river defense line of over 200 li from Xinan to Zhaoli River in Shanxian has been controlled by the Communist forces. Several ferry crossings, including Kuang Kou, Bailang, Nancun, and Zhaoli River, are also in the hands of the Communist forces. About 7,000 Communist troops are gathered in this area, and heavy Communist forces are also entrenched on the opposite bank of Yuanqu, with unclear intentions. Mianchi is now in a state of terror, and the city gates are blocked. Shanxian and Xinan are also under serious threat, and the situation in western Henan has suddenly become tense.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces on the north bank of the Yellow River are colluding north and south with Li Xiannian's forces entrenched in Lushi, occupying four northern townships in Xinan.

[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 27th Dispatch] After recovering Luyi, the National Army continued to expand its gains to the southwest, searching and suppressing the Communist forces in Wutaimiao and Xuanchengji. The remaining Communist forces who fled from Boxian and Jigang County are now scattered in various directions towards Siling and Mengyin, and local militias are preventing them from regrouping. In addition, the Communist forces on the border of Henan appear to be attacking the Dabie Mountains.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces that retreated north from the Tongrunzhen area on the north bank of the Luo River once gathered near Malan, but have now retreated further to the Jushui River basin and the Juyuanguan area, hastily building fortifications.

### Communist Forces' Offensive in Changji Frustrated, National Army Deploys for Decisive Battle, Communist Forces South of Pulandian Exert All Efforts to Invade North

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th Dispatch] The reason for the slight setback of the Communist forces' offensive on the Changji front is the arrival of National Army reinforcements. There is also a strong National Army force in Dehui.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 27th Dispatch] Since the Northeastern Communist forces crossed the Songhua River on the 18th to invade south, it has only been ten days, but they have been pressing south step by step and approaching Changchun. However, since the beginning of the fighting, there has been no fierce contact. According to military observers, the National Army is conducting a strategic retreat and deploying for a decisive battle, aiming to deal a fatal blow to the invading Communist forces.

[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 27th Dispatch] A visitor from Changchun said that the Chinese Communist Party's spring offensive in the Northeast was expected long ago, and the National Army Headquarters has made appropriate preparations. The central and northern armies may achieve initial victories, but will ultimately fail. Currently, the Communist forces have two objectives in their offensive in the Northeast: militarily, to support the Communist forces fighting in Shandong; politically, to demonstrate the strength of the Chinese Communist Party and the general importance of the Communist movement before the Moscow Conference.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces are close to Changchun, and gunshots could be heard in the eastern suburbs last night. The Changshi line retreated to Xinglong Mountain (20 li from Changchun) to the southwest, the Changde section retreated to Yijianbao (28 li north of Changchun), and the Changtao Road retreated to the southeast of Xiaohelong. The situation is becoming tense. Traffic to the suburbs has been cut off, and the streets are heavily guarded by military police, indicating that a major battle is about to begin in the suburbs. Military sources also confirmed that the National Army in Jiutai withdrew yesterday afternoon.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces attacking Jilin are advancing from Huapichang. Liang Huasheng flew back to Jilin a few days ago to take command. While in Shenyang, he said that Yongji could hold out for more than half a month without reinforcements.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 26th Dispatch] Li Hong, commander of the New Eighth Army, told reporters at 5:00 PM on the 26th that the Communist forces' claim of launching 200,000 troops to attack Jilin and Changchun is nothing more than an attempt to cover up their repeated defeats. Judging from their forced withdrawal from Huapichang, it is clear that their forces are dispersed and unable to hold their ground. The National Army has made strategic adjustments in line with the actual situation, so sometimes retreating from a certain location is not due to the Communist forces' offensive.

[Another Dispatch] Military news: Huapichang Railway Station on the Jichang Road (70 li from Jilin) was briefly occupied by the Communist forces around 1:00 AM on the 26th. After receiving the news, the military headquarters immediately sent a patrol train to search and suppress the Communist forces. By 2:00 PM, the Communist forces had been repelled. The situation at the front of Tumenling is currently unclear.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th Dispatch] The 3,000 men of the First and Second Regiments of the Independent Division of the Communist forces harassing the west side of the Zhongchang Road are now near Dashicao and Nangou, 30 kilometers north of Wafangdian, and appear to be advancing eastward.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces south of Pulandian and Piziwo are exerting all their efforts to invade north in response to the Communist forces' offensive on the Changji front. A certain unit of the Sixth Army Group is intercepting them everywhere.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th Dispatch] Zheng Dongguo said that over 100,000 Communist forces have crossed the Songhua River to invade south, with tens of thousands more in the follow-up units. In order to consolidate the major strongholds of Changchun and Jilin, the National Army has planned to withdraw from smaller strongholds. Currently, the Communist forces are closest to Changchun at 20 kilometers. The National Army is continuously sending reinforcements north, and Changchun can be defended without worry. Regarding the situation in southern Liaoning, he said that the takeover of Dalian must be based on orders from the central government. Pulandian has not been lost. Recently, the Communist forces have increased their troops in Dalian by about 40,000. If the takeover is carried out immediately, a battle will be unavoidable. He also said that Lin Biao is still commanding in Harbin, and the rumor of replacing Zhang Xueshi is not accurate.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Zheng Dongguo arrived in Nanjing around 4:00 PM on the 27th.

[Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 26th Dispatch] Du Yuming has recently been starting his day at dawn, and inspections are also very busy. The operations department of the Command Headquarters is very tense. Military vehicles traveling north and south on the Shenchang Road are frequent, and passenger and freight trains are still suspended.

### Youth Party Submits List, Formally Delivered to the Government by Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang Says Decision Made to First Participate in Four Institutions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The list of the Youth Party's representatives to participate in the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Political Consultative Council, and Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association has been personally delivered to Chen Lifu and Lei Zhen by Zuo Shunsheng of the party to be forwarded to the government. Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and Liu Dongyan arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai yesterday. At 9:00 AM on the 27th, the three men met with Chairman Chiang, providing opinions on the reorganization of the government and also making contributions on financial and monetary issues. The Youth Party has proposed the following number of representatives to participate in the four institutions: 13 Legislative Yuan members, 6 Control Yuan members, 40 Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association members (including 16 Standing Committee members), and 11 Political Consultative Council members. It is also reported that the Central Standing Committee will hold its 57th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th, at which time it will decide on the Kuomintang's candidates to participate in the four institutions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and others are scheduled to attend the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council on the 28th and will return to Shanghai that evening. Li visited Zhang Qun today to discuss the Sichuan-Xikang issue.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] A reporter inquired with Li Huang about the Youth Party's submission of the list. He said that the party had already discussed the issue of submitting the list to a mature stage while in Shanghai. However, after arriving in Nanjing, they re-negotiated with government officials for several days before making a decision. The reasons for this are: first, the issue of the number of members in the Standing Committee, Propaganda Committee, Research Committee, and Supervisory Committee of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association has recently been decided to be 16; second, after the participation of various parties in the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, the organizational law should be revised to adapt to party politics; third, the two parties hope that the government can issue a statement indicating that the government is moving towards democratic politics. After several days of consultation, an agreement was finally reached. The government has already expressed its agreement to issue a statement. Li also told reporters that his opinions on the reorganization of the government are as follows: first, a comprehensive reorganization, focusing on the reform of local politics; second, the Youth Party has decided internally that it cannot participate alone, so it has only now submitted the list for the four institutions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] When Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Liu Dongyan, and others met with the Chairman, in addition to briefly discussing the reorganization of the government, they also discussed current financial and monetary policies. Li Huang and others also expressed their hope that they could restore order as soon as possible.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Luo Longji and Ye Duyi of the Democratic League arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 27th, carrying a letter signed by Zhang Lan to Chairman Chiang, over a thousand words long, focusing on calling for peace, stopping the civil war, and explaining various economic and political points. They will meet with government officials within a few days and then deliver the letter. The letter does not contain any specific suggestions.

### National Army Advances in Western Hebei, Flanking Communist Forces on Two Routes, Battle of Mancheng Approaches Decisive Stage

The members of the Journalist Delegation were extremely tired after a long flight of over 13 hours. Japanese reporters were most interested in Chen Bosheng, the Central News Agency representative and editor-in-chief who is the head of the delegation.

### Using Reparations and Foreign Materials to Assist in the Restoration of Northeast China's Industry and Mining: Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks in Shenyang En Route to His Ancestral Home

Du Yuming, along with the chairmen and mayors of various provinces, were all present at the airport to see him off. The plane will briefly stop in Ping [Beiping] before continuing to Beijing. Before departing from Shenyang, Wang had a lengthy discussion with Xiong Shihui at his official residence on the afternoon of the 26th.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang has cancelled his trip to Changchun.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang arrived in Ping [Beiping] at 11:20 AM on the 27th aboard the "Ziqiang" plane from Shenyang. After having lunch at Nanyuan Airport, he flew back to Beijing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang returned to the capital at 4:15 PM on the 27th via special plane from Shenyang via Ping [Beiping]. Those welcoming him at Ming Palace Airport included Liu Cuo, Gan Naiguang, Wang Huacheng, Zhang Yuanchang, and several dozen others. According to Wang's remarks to our newspaper at the airport, his purpose in going to Ping [Beiping] and Pan [Shenyang] "was merely to take a look and meet with people from the Northeast." When asked by reporters whether the rumors that this trip was to negotiate various issues related to the Northeast with the Soviet side were true, Wang replied, "That is not true." It is noted that Wang departed from Beijing on the 20th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang received our newspaper's reporter at his private residence at 5:00 PM on the 27th, and spoke of his impressions of this trip, stating: The extent of damage in Shenyang has reached 70% to 80%. The government intends to use reparations materials and other foreign materials to enable the early restoration of its industry and mining. He believes that if these materials can be used wisely, the entire Northeast can be highly industrialized within five to eight years. During his talk, Wang did not specify the reasons for the damage suffered by Shenyang and other places, nor did he explain how to obtain Japanese reparations materials and other foreign materials.

Wang once traveled to the Northeast 32 years ago. This time, revisiting the old place, he highly praised the human and material resources of the Northeast. He said: "During this trip to the Northeast, I observed the political, economic, and other conditions there. The opening up of the Northeast occurred after 1900. Before that, the Manchus strictly prohibited people from within the Guannei [China Proper] from migrating there. However, after more than ten years of labor by the Chinese people, the number of compatriots from Guannei, especially Hebei and Shandong, migrating there has increased year by year, reaching 1 to 2 million people annually. Some go in the spring and return in the autumn, while others settle there permanently. Since the庚子 [Gengzi] Year [1900], the population has increased from the original 10 million to 45 million. These people are all outstanding individuals from Guannei, who are young, strong, hardworking, and resilient, with excellent qualities and a strong spirit of enterprise. After decades of hard work, they have laid the foundation for the Northeast. Therefore, although the Japanese occupied the Northeast for as long as fourteen years, I did not see the people there become discouraged due to more than ten years of oppression. They are as strong and hardworking as ever, and no less so than before the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident]. I believed this in the past, and this trip to the north has confirmed the accuracy of this concept. Speaking of the industrial situation in the Northeast, the land there is fertile. The industrial construction of the Japanese in the Northeast has only been around for six or seven years in large part. The scale of Shenyang is very impressive, but it has only been around for six or seven years. The extent of damage currently reaches 70% to 80%. The government plans to use Japanese reparations materials and other foreign materials to assist in the early restoration of industry and mining. According to experts' estimates, if we can make good use of materials, oil field resources, and the strength of the people, we can also make the entire Northeast a highly industrialized area within five to eight years, surpassing the standards of Japan."

Speaking of his feelings in Beiping, Wang said: "In the past, I had a close relationship with Peking University and Tsinghua University. This time, witnessing the tireless teaching spirit of the staff of the two universities under difficult living conditions, which has restored to pre-war state, is admirable and comforting. The facilities of the two universities may be restored to pre-war standards in two years."

Regarding the newspaper reports that he was carrying an important mission on this trip, Wang said: "That is not true." After a long journey, Wang's spirits were good, and he expressed optimism about the country's future. When the reporter took his leave, Wang repeatedly said: "We hope that peace will be restored and unification will be completed as soon as possible." His tone was solemn and forceful, giving people much confidence.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] According to sources, Foreign Minister Wang's trip to the north mainly involves domestic affairs, with little to do with foreign affairs. A Japanese reporter interviewed Wang at the Nanyuan Airport lounge. Wang answered the reporter's questions, saying: (1) "Our country has not requested to participate in the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference." When asked about the takeover of Dalian, the China Changchun Railway, and the secret agreements between Sheng Shicai and the Soviet Union, Wang did not respond. He told reporters that he hoped the Chinese people would not be too anxious about the Northeast and foreign affairs, and not make bad assumptions. (2) Wang continued to describe his impressions of inspecting the Northeast, saying: "The foundation of China in the Northeast is built on the working masses. If we use military force to conquer the Northeast, then this military force will eventually collapse. If we use political methods to rule the Northeast, these political methods will also inevitably fail. Only the Northeast based on the working masses is solid and unshakeable." (3) "Regarding the Xisha Islands [Paracel Islands] issue, I believe that a reasonable solution can ultimately be obtained. However, negotiations are still in progress, and I am not in a position to make other remarks." When asked by the reporter whether there were still one or two isolated islands in the Xisha Islands where French troops had not withdrawn, Wang remained silent. (4) "Regarding the Sino-Philippine Commercial Treaty issue, if the Philippine side does not overturn the matters already agreed upon by China and the Philippines and abandons anti-Chinese actions and legislation, then the Sino-Philippine commercial negotiations can be resumed at any time."

However, for the production and marketing businesses of loans, the responsible authorities and the lending banks and bureaus should send personnel to audit the accounts at any time, and strictly comply with the following points:

(A) Production Businesses: (1) The quantity and quality of production must meet the predetermined plan; (2) The selling price of products must not violate the regulations of the responsible authority; (3) Loan funds must be used exclusively for production turnover and must not be transferred for other operations; (4) Products must not be hoarded for speculation. When necessary, the responsible supply authority will order a portion or all of the products at a certain price; (5) Those who violate any of the provisions of this article will, in addition to having their loans recalled in advance, be transferred to the relevant responsible authority for discussion based on the severity of their circumstances.

(B) Transportation Businesses: (1) Allocate a certain amount of transportation capacity to transport supply goods; (2) Transport supply goods at the lowest possible freight rate; (3) Transport supply goods on the earliest possible date.

### Premier Song Explains the Key Points of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, Hosting a Tea Party for Senators Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Premier Song Ziwen held a tea party at the Executive Yuan at 4:30 PM on the 27th to entertain all senators from the Senate Standing Committee. Bei Fengyi, Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, and Yu Hongjun attended and answered questions. The event adjourned at 6:00 PM. All reports and inquiries focused on the economic emergency measures plan, without involving other matters, so the tea party went well. A total of twelve senators attended, including Wu Yifang, Wang Puhan, Fan Yu, Mo Dehui, Li Huang, and Chen Qitian. Fu Sinian, Luo Heng, and Yin Shuxian did not attend. First, Premier Song reported on the formulation and implementation of the economic emergency measures plan and explained two key points of the plan: (1) The immediate goal is to crack down on speculation; (2) The fundamental goal is to balance revenue and expenditure. The measures include tightening expenditures and making public utilities self-sufficient or privatizing them to reduce the burden on the national treasury. Then, various senators raised inquiries, which are briefly noted as follows:

Inquiries and Responses

Xue Mingjian asked: (1) Public utilities are the first to raise prices, affecting commodity prices; (2) The issuance of large amounts of fiat currency causes public panic and misunderstanding, and it is best to avoid inflation. Wang Puhan asked: (1) What are the measures in the plan to stabilize the currency system? (2) Conscription in various places has caused harassment to the people. How will this be handled? Song replied: The conscription issue can be addressed by the Ministry of National Defense. Su Ting asked: Prices increase with the US dollar exchange rate, while wages are based on a monthly index. What are the measures to flatten prices? Song replied: Daily necessities can be controlled, so efforts are being made to supply goods at fixed prices. Wang Yunwu added in reply: Workers' wages have been based on the cost of living index since before the war, so wages are very high. Wages are now uniformly issued according to the cost of living index in January, but daily necessities are rationed and priced through negotiation, which is handled by various factories. Wu Yifang asked: Can private schools be rationed with in-kind goods? Wang replied: No. Gan Jiaxin asked: When implementing the plan, attention should be paid to: (1) Balancing revenue and expenditure; (2) Whether production loans are being recovered; (3) Gold smuggling to Hong Kong; (4) In-kind rationing should be flexible; (5) Effective measures should be adopted to use the deposits of Chinese citizens abroad; (6) The Shanghai Economic Supervisory Group only handles small matters and not big ones; (7) The plan should be implemented carefully step by step, otherwise the government's credit will be bankrupt. Song replied: (1) Production loans that have not yet matured have not been recovered; (2) The price of gold in Hong Kong has fallen, and there is currently no smuggling to Hong Kong; (3) The Ministry of Finance has drafted measures for using deposits abroad, which will be announced soon. Xi Zhenduo asked: (1) Attention should be paid to gold price fluctuations; (2) The adjustment of the US dollar exchange rate and the price increases of public utilities affect commodity prices. How can this be suppressed? A response is needed; (3) The handling of enemy and puppet properties should be clarified; (4) Attention should be paid to the lives of people in the border areas to ensure their stability. Song immediately instructed Jiang Menglin to respond on behalf of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. Mo Dehui said: The current measures are measures of desperation. He hopes that they will not be empty words and hopes that Song can meet with senators from time to time. Approaching the government with public opinion can resolve many difficulties. Song expressed, "Very good."

[Another Dispatch] During Premier Song's tea party, a senator asked whether Song's frequent presence in Shanghai would prevent him from addressing the country's overall issues. Song replied that Shanghai is an important area for our country, and 50% of the country's income is in Shanghai. As Minister of Finance, I would go to Shanghai two or three times a week.

[Another Dispatch] The Senate Standing Committee will hold a regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th, with Qian Changzhao, Chairman of the National Resources Commission, reporting.

Editorial

### Rationing Issues in the Current Stage

How rationing is implemented is attracting attention, especially from the working class, who hope to obtain some compensation from it after the freezing of the cost-of-living index, and are paying even closer attention to this matter. There are many issues worthy of discussion. We hereby raise further opinions as follows:

(1) The Issue of Converting Goods into Cash: Since the cost-of-living index has been frozen at the January level, in order to compensate for this, goods should be rationed starting from this month. According to government announcements, all rice, flour, fuel, cloth, etc., have been separately undertaken by the responsible departments. However, where are the goods stored? What is the total quantity stored? How can they be transported to the rationing locations in a short period of time? Which organizations will implement the rationing? How many units and people are entitled to receive rations? What procedures will be used for distribution? What forms and documents should the recipients prepare? Where should the payments be made? What are the rationing prices, and the time periods, locations, etc.? All these details still need to be planned and designated. However, this month is already ending today. These preparations not only need to be organized separately by the government but also by the factories. Therefore, the suggestion from the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to convert the difference between the prices of February and January into cash is very timely and should be promptly reviewed and implemented. Moreover, if there are no other problems with the source of these daily necessities, then the rationing of goods in subsequent months may also be handled in this way. This is because: (1) The government can avoid countless labor and expenses; (2) Factories can also save a lot of trouble and costs; (3) The working class will not actually suffer any losses; (4) The procedures are simple; (5) The time is easy to determine.

(2) The Issue of the Types and Quantities of Goods: The government stipulates that each worker receives 4 dou of rice, 100 catties of coal briquettes, and 2 zhang of cloth every six months. Some people believe that the types and quantities are too small, and the difference compared to civil servants and teachers is too large, so they have expressed their dissent. Some advocate (1) that both the types and quantities should be increased to be equal to those of civil servants and teachers, or (2) that the items included in the cost-of-living index should all be included, or even directly propose (3) restoring the cost-of-living index. In fact, if the second method is implemented, it would be no different from restoring the cost-of-living index, merely adding a set of procedures in the calculation, which would be somewhat comical. Therefore, if the third method cannot be implemented, then the only feasible method is the first one, that is, to increase the types and quantities of rations for workers separately, in accordance with the standards for civil servants and teachers. The reason is that the implementation of rationing is originally intended to supply daily necessities at affordable prices to reduce their burden, so the identity, occupation, etc., of the recipients do not need to be distinguished. In countries with comprehensive rationing, there is originally no difference between workers and civil servants and teachers, except for a very small number of special treatments. In fact, the consumption of rice, flour, cloth, etc., by workers may even be higher than that of intellectuals. Therefore, we also believe that this request is very reasonable and very easy to implement. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau has approved a flexible approach, expanding the types to six: rice, coal, oil, salt, sugar, and cloth, which is equal to what civil servants and teachers receive. The quantities are set at 8 dou of rice, 1.5 dan of coal, 5 catties of oil, 5 catties of salt, 1 catty of sugar, and 5 chi of cloth. Except for sugar and cloth, which remain the same, the sugar item is already equal to that of civil servants and teachers, coal is increased by 50%, and the quantities of oil and salt are even higher than those of civil servants and teachers, based on the household survey from the cost-of-living index, which is certainly a very reasonable measure.

(3) The Issue of Rationing Agencies: To date, the central and local rationing agencies have still not been determined. What is known is that (1) the central government will supply goods through the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Food, and the Resources Committee; (2) the local government will be responsible for managing the matter through local administrative agencies, and existing goods management agencies, special stores, or cooperatives will handle the actual work. We have always opposed overlapping agencies. Therefore, if the matter of rationing can be handled conveniently without increasing agencies and personnel, we will naturally strongly support it in principle. However, once the matter of rationing is undertaken, it will involve many complexities, and everything must consider the supply and convenience of the public. The procedures for the time, location, type, quantity, etc., must be simple and uniform, in order to establish credibility. It is essential to avoid shifting responsibility and creating confusion, which would increase the burden on recipients and lose public trust. Therefore, we believe that firstly, there must be a responsible agency to take overall charge of the matter, and secondly, one should not be too stingy with the necessary office personnel and expenses.

(4) The Issue of Rationing Targets: The Economic Emergency Measures Program and the Detailed Rules for the Supply of Daily Necessities supplemented to this program seem to limit the rationing targets to civil servants and teachers and industrial workers. Occupational workers, store employees, and private school teachers and staff are not included. In fact, since they are all teachers and staff, why differentiate between public and private? As for occupational workers and store employees, there are many who are currently paid according to the cost-of-living index. Since the index has been frozen, rationing goods should also be issued in accordance with the example, to ensure uniformity. The Social Affairs Bureau has supplemented this scope of application, stipulating that anyone who is paid according to the cost-of-living index, regardless of the type of worker, including store employees, should be allowed to handle the matter together. This method can save countless hassles and is very appropriate.

In addition to the above four points, there is also the issue of civil servants' salaries. After the implementation of rationing of daily necessities, there are rumors that the method of adjusting salaries every three months will be shelved. If the rumors are true, it is also worth considering. This is because civil servants' salaries have never been calculated according to the cost-of-living index, and the fact that their salaries are low is a well-known fact. Regardless of the benefits they will enjoy after the implementation of rationing starting from March 15th, the current salaries they receive are far below the calculations based on the index. Therefore, freezing salaries and not adjusting them is ultimately unreasonable. Some say that there was no such statement in the emergency plan and the discussions of the authorities, and that it is just a rumor. We also deeply believe that it is just a rumor.

### Valuing People's Spiritual Food

Modern newspapers are often called "spiritual food." People cannot go a day without reading the newspaper, which is equivalent to people cannot go a day without eating. The function of modern newspapers for society is really very significant. Thus, Western countries all use the development of each country's newspaper industry as a measure to assess the level of its culture. Our country's newspaper industry has been known to be backward. But after eight years of arduous struggle during the Anti-Japanese War, it has indeed made significant progress after the victory. Taking Shanghai as an example, today's newspaper industry in Shanghai, when compared with before the Anti-Japanese War, has made obvious progress whether in content, form, or sales. But in recent months, the national newspaper industry, because of the sharp rise in foreign exchange rates and the reduction in the source of newsprint, has had to reduce the number of pages and increase the price, so that our country's newspaper industry is facing another serious crisis.

The Import Temporary Management Committee announced on the 18th of this month the import quota for February to April this year. Among them, regarding the portion of spiritual food, the government approved only 3.45 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange for paper imports, and cigarette paper, pulp, and other paper must also be included. The remaining foreign exchange that can be used to purchase newsprint rolls and flat paper is only 2 million U.S. dollars. If all the foreign exchange is used to purchase Canadian paper, only 12,500 tons can be purchased for the use of the national newspaper industry. We feel that the government's quota for paper imports is not only too restrictive but also obviously unfair. Although those affected by this approach are only the Chinese newspaper industry, the bad consequences will inevitably affect the cultural undertaking of the Chinese nation. Therefore, standing in the position of the newspaper industry, and also for the sake of the future of the cultural undertaking, we have to appeal loudly to the government, requesting the responsible authorities to immediately relax the limits on paper imports!

We not only fully understand the current economic difficulties, but also recognize that the government's adoption of import restrictions is indeed necessary. During this difficult period, any sector or industry must tighten its belt. The newspaper industry is naturally no exception and should also reduce the number of pages and reduce the circulation to avoid wasting paper. However, the distance between the government's quota and the actual needs is really too far. Taking the newspaper industry in Shanghai as an example, the monthly consumption of paper is about 4,000 tons. During this period from February to April, the amount of paper required by the Shanghai newspaper industry suddenly reduced by half, how can our colleagues cope with this situation? The government is now implementing an economic emergency plan. How can this approach reduce the price of newsprint? Moreover, newsprint is the spiritual food of the people, which cannot be interrupted for a day, otherwise, the people will panic spiritually, and the severity is no less than a food panic. I remember during this war, in the most dangerous year for Britain, when it was surrounded by German submarines, even food became a problem. But in this year, the amount of paper imported into Britain still reached 500,000 tons, which is enough to show the importance that the British authorities attached to spiritual food. Britain could do this during wartime, how can our country ignore the spiritual food of the people in peacetime! The concept of our people has always been that "spirit is more important than matter." How can the government authorities sit idly by and watch the people's spiritual food panic?

The announcement of the import quota for the first quarter of this year may be due to the urgency of the time. The actual needs of various goods could not be taken into account, which makes us unable to express our regret. The handling of paper is unfair, as mentioned above. In addition, there is one more thing, because it is also related to culture, that we cannot but point out. That is, the Import Temporary Management Committee did not impose any restrictions on the import of foreign-made films, but restricted the film negatives used to make films. The impact of this on the domestic film industry is no less than a major blow, and it encourages the import of foreign films instead. The unreasonableness of this approach is self-evident.

In short, we have to petition the government regarding the import quotas stipulated by the government, especially several items related to cultural undertakings, requesting the government to think about the future of the cultural undertaking, pay more attention to the people's spiritual food, and promptly relax the limits on paper imports!

### The United States Proposes a Trusteeship Agreement Draft; The Soviet Union Suggests Three Revisions; The Security Council Postpones the Debate Until the Seventh of Next Month

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: At the Security Council meeting today, the Soviet representative Gromyko immediately accepted the terms proposed by the United States for the trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated islands in the Central Pacific.

[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 26th] The Security Council met today to discuss the issue of the former Japanese mandated islands. First, the US representative Austin stated the US position, followed by the Soviet representative Gromyko. Gromyko reiterated the previous position, saying that it was fair to hand over these islands to the United States for management, and proposed three requests for revision: (1) The phrase "become an integral part of the United States" in the draft should be deleted; (2) The phrase "promote the self-government of the residents" in the draft should be changed to "promote the self-government or independence of the residents"; (3) The Security Council has the right to change or terminate the trusteeship agreement.

[French News Agency, New York, Lake Success, 26th] The US representative Austin submitted a proposal to the Security Council today, advocating that the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific should be immediately handed over to the United States for trusteeship, and that "military strategic areas" should be established in the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands. However, the final fate of these islands should be decided by the peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet representative Gromyko expressed his support for this. The Security Council immediately decided to postpone the Australian proposal for discussion until March 7, so that the representatives could have sufficient time to consult with their respective governments.

The US representative Austin stated in his speech when submitting the above proposal that the US proposal is sufficient to show that the American people are determined to prevent these islands from becoming a springboard for launching aggression against the United States or other member states of the United Nations. The US aim is to ensure its own security and international collective security. The United States still adheres to the Atlantic Charter and will not engage in territorial expansion after the war. The United States will manage the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific in accordance with the provisions of the Atlantic Charter. In the future, we will establish an international control system to control the military and weapons, and to control the economic, political, cultural, and social development of the people of the islands. The current US trusteeship method will not hinder the implementation of all measures stipulated by the international control system. The final fate of the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific must be decided by the peace treaty with Japan. The US proposal to quickly hand over the islands it has already occupied to the United States for trusteeship is strategically important. Japan violated its obligations and turned these islands into heavily fortified fortresses, thereby isolating the United States from Guam, the Philippine Islands, and the territories of the British and Dutch in the Far East. The most important military strategic locations in the world are now under the absolute control of the great powers, but the United States only proposes to grant trusteeship and does not intend to annex these islands. The US trusteeship draft also takes into account the trusteeship agreement passed by the last General Assembly of the United Nations. According to the trusteeship charter, bases should be built on these islands. The United States has submitted a trusteeship plan to the relevant countries, which can be said to have fulfilled its obligations. Considering that other member states of the United Nations do not seek to manage these islands, the US action seems more reasonable. The United States believes that the trusteeship agreement can be implemented immediately without waiting for the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet representative Gromyko took the floor and expressed that his government supported the US plan, and said that it was completely reasonable for us to authorize the United States to manage these islands because the United States suffered far greater losses on these islands during the war than other Allied countries.

Scope of Goods Rationing Expanded, Those Paid According to Index Eligible to Apply for Supply, Six Types Added, Quantities Increased Separately, Social Bureau Announces Average Prices Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Today is the last day of February. How should the salaries and wages of employees of various factories be calculated for this month? Yesterday, Director Wu of the Social Bureau stated: "In addition to being paid according to the January cost of living index, a 'differential subsidy system' will be implemented. That is, the difference between the average market price of several essential daily necessities determined by the government for rationing in February and the average market price in January will be converted into legal tender and issued by the factory. The quantity and types of daily necessities for this rationing originally only stipulated 5 'shi dou' of rice per person per month, 100 'shi jin' of coal briquettes per person per month, and 2 'zhang' of cloth per person every six months, and were limited to factory employees only. This time, Mayor Wu and I went to the capital to strongly advocate to the authorities, and with the approval of Chairman Chiang, the types and quantities of daily necessities supplied have been increased to:

(1) Rice or flour - 8 'shi dou' of rice per person per month, or 2 bags of flour.

(2) Cloth - 5 'chi' per person per month, i.e., 3 'zhang' every six months.

(3) Fuel - 150 'shi jin' of coal briquettes per person per month.

(4) Salt - 3 'shi jin' per person per month.

(5) Sugar - 1 'shi jin' per person per month.

(6) Cooking oil - 5 'shi jin' per person per month.

The scope of supply has also been expanded to include all those whose salaries and wages are calculated based on the cost of living index. This method will be implemented on a trial basis, limited to this city for the time being. The Social Bureau is scheduled to announce today the average price for January, the average price for February, the difference, and the converted amount for the above six major essential commodities. This month's salaries and wages will be calculated accordingly." Director Wu finally stated that this method is currently a trial, for a minimum of three months and a maximum of five months.

Chairman Authorizes Handling as Appropriate

Since the government announced the Emergency Economic Measures, freezing the January cost of living index and providing fewer types and quantities of daily necessities to employees than to civil servants and teachers, workers in various places have expressed opposition upon hearing the news. Chairman Chiang summoned Mayor Wu and Director Wu to the capital on the afternoon of the 25th to discuss this matter. The two immediately took the night train to Beijing at 11 p.m. with their proposed suggestions. On the morning of the 26th, they paid a visit to President Song, and at noon, the Chairman hosted a banquet, during which the two presented their proposed suggestions, namely that the types of daily necessities supplied to workers in this city should be equal to those of civil servants and teachers, and that the quantity should be based on the quantity used when compiling the cost of living index. The Chairman believed that if Shanghai had no choice but to do so, it could be handled accordingly. The two completed their mission in the capital and took the express train back to Shanghai at 3:45 p.m. on the afternoon of the 26th, arriving at around 11 p.m.

Those Who Do Not Wish to Receive Rations in Kind May Implement Differential Cash Payments

Director Wu told reporters yesterday: I can give up my official position, but the policy must be implemented. Now that the proposed method has been adopted by the government, I will do my best to solve the living problems of the city's workers first, and then do my best to suppress prices. There are a total of 216,750 industrial workers in this city. This time, through a flexible method, it is stipulated that all those whose salaries and wages are calculated according to the cost of living index (that is, no longer limited to civil servants, teachers, and industrial workers) can be included in this method, which can include 500,000 people. Whether to implement the differential subsidy system or supply goods in kind in the future depends entirely on the opinion of the factory. Because many factory owners believe that the quality of the goods supplied and the procedures for receiving and distributing goods are too troublesome, if labor and management agree to implement the differential subsidy system, the factory will issue the difference to the employees in converted legal tender. Otherwise, it is also possible to apply to the Social Bureau to purchase goods in kind for supply. The Social Bureau will announce the average price of the six major essential commodities at the end of each month, as well as the difference from the previous month. The calculation is based on the average price from the 1st to the 25th. The compilation is based on retail prices, not wholesale prices. The Social Bureau will definitely strive for reasonableness, ensuring that the subsidy can buy the goods in kind on the market.

Regarding the workers' hope to restore the calculation of wages based on the cost of living index, Director Wu expressed: It is feared that this is impossible.

Rationing Expected by Mid-Next Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday after returning from Nanjing the night before: The cost of living index issue is a matter within the purview of the Social Bureau, and the detailed content will be fully published by the Social Bureau today. As for the Civil Servants and Teachers Daily Necessities Allocation Committee, it is organized by 15 institutions including the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Department, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Materials Supply Bureau, Taiwan Sugar Company, China Textile Company, Salt Affairs Bureau, China Grain Company, China Vegetable Oil Factory, and Fuel Management Committee. Mayor Wu serves as the chairman, but it must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before it can be established. The central government's order has not yet arrived, but it is believed that it will arrive within days. After the allocation committee is formally established, it will actively carry out the allocation matters, striving to start distributing rations separately from March 15th. Regarding the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index, it is said that the central government is considering it, but the outcome is still impossible to predict at this time.

Postal Workers' Representatives Return to Shanghai, Petition Has Yielded Results [Report from Our Newspaper] Shui Xiangyun, Wang Zhenbai, and other nine members of the Standing Committee of the National Postal Workers' Union, who went to Beijing to petition regarding the freezing of the cost of living index for postal workers, returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Shui, he and representatives of postal workers from Beijing, Hankou, Henan, Anhui, and other places stated their opinions to Acting Director Huo of the Directorate General of Posts. Mr. Huo stated that he was restricted by laws and regulations and could not grant their request, but he was sympathetic to the difficult living conditions of postal workers and approved the issuance of differential cash payments according to the method of rationing goods in kind for civil servants and teachers. The representatives accepted this.

[Report from Our Newspaper] A reporter asked Director Wu of the Social Bureau yesterday: The method of supplying goods in kind will be implemented from March. Civil servants and teachers have not yet been issued this month. Will the central government also implement a "differential subsidy system" to subsidize civil servants and teachers with cash? Director Wu replied: After the method of supplying daily necessities to civil servants and teachers was announced, a committee has been organized by 15 agencies in this city to handle it. However, no orders have arrived from the Executive Yuan so far, and this matter should await instructions from the central government.

Yellow Goods Fly Everywhere, Efforts to Investigate Intensively, Future Work of the Economic Supervisory Team Will Be Conducted in Secret

This is in accordance with the Chairman's instructions to make meticulous arrangements for the "economic detection network" in order to eliminate and prevent possible man-made pathologies in the economic field in the future, and to ensure the implementation of the Emergency Economic Measures.

Embezzlement of Public Funds for Gold Purchases, Related to Huangzhong Company

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the embezzlement of public funds by Zhao Pei, director of the Qinghai Provincial Government's Office in Beijing, it is reported that the Qinghai-Gansu and Qinghai-Tibet Highway Bureaus applied to the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transport for 1 billion yuan in engineering funds in December of last year to improve the two highways. Zhao Pei was responsible for receiving the funds. When the National Treasury Bureau notified the payment, Zhao entrusted the Shanghai Office of Huangzhong Company to receive the funds on his behalf. Huangzhong Company is nominally a private business organization engaged in the cotton cloth business. It was established in Xining in November of the 44th year. The Shanghai Office was opened in September of the 35th year, located at No. 7 Tongan Lane, Hankou Road. The manager is Wu Ziming. This time, the supervisors and the Economic Supervisory Team found that Huangzhong Company purchased a large number of gold bars from Tongfengyu Gold Shop. Wu Ziming was summoned and reportedly admitted that he had been entrusted by a friend in Qinghai to buy gold, and that the gold had been taken to other places by this friend. The supervisors believe that Zhao Pei entrusted Huangzhong Company to receive public funds, and Huangzhong Company happened to buy a large amount of gold with huge sums of money. The subtle clues are clearly visible. Therefore, various evidence has been collected and an impeachment will be filed soon.

If the transaction could not be completed, the refund would still be based on U.S. dollars.

When the auditors came to the bank to audit the accounts, they were told the truth and the relevant documents were checked. The auditors verified that it was consistent and indicated that it was not related to the Emergency Economic Measures.

Silver Shops Hopeful to Resume Business

During this trip to Beijing, I suggested a compromise to the central government, hoping to allow workers to have jobs and prevent gold from flowing into the black market. The central government stated that it could continue to operate as long as it did not violate these two principles.

Principles for Supplementary Payment of Deed Tax Determined for Land Transfers in Huangpu and Other Districts

[Report from Our Newspaper] Deed tax should be levied on land transfers according to law. Land transfers in this city have been very complicated from the period of the occupation to the present. When the Land Administration Bureau started land registration after the victory, it temporarily postponed the collection in order to reduce procedures. Now that the land registration procedures in Huangpu and other six districts have been completed, the arrangement of the deed tax cannot be delayed any longer, so it has been decided to pay the deed tax retroactively. The principles are: The transfer of land owned by foreigners will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the treaty if they are treaty nationals. For land deeds owned by Chinese citizens, if the transfer of property rights occurred on December 8 of the 31st year, deed tax should be supplemented. The tax rate is 6% for sales deed tax, 4% for pawn deed tax, and 2% for exchange deed tax. For land in registered areas after the victory, the transfer must also be supplemented before applying for registration. The starting standard for supplementary deed tax is based on 500 yuan per lot, and those less than 500 yuan are exempt. If several lots are calculated together and the tax amount is more than 500 yuan, it should still be paid according to the regulations.

The Central Shipyard plans to build a new Wusong shipyard. It has been approved to requisition private land and houses. The Land Administration Bureau has been ordered to start surveying and appraising and notifying the deadline for relocation. The parties concerned believe that the appraisal is not fair and the relocation deadline is too urgent. Representatives were elected to appeal to the Municipal Council for relief. After the council submitted an inquiry to the municipal government, a reply has now been received. According to the reply, the Land Administration Bureau has carefully handled the land appraisal in accordance with the prescribed procedures and there are no unfair circumstances in the review. If the owners believe that the appraisal is unfair, they can file an objection with the bureau in accordance with the law. According to the provisions of the Land Law, it shall be submitted to the Municipal Standard Land Price Assessment Committee for assessment. However, the Central Shipyard is deeply sympathetic to the situation of the people whose land and houses have been requisitioned. Once the new shipyard of the factory starts construction, they can use the available energy at that time to find ways to employ them as soon as possible to provide relief.

Paris New Village Robbery, Thieves Wear Civilian Police Uniforms, Victim Calls for Help and Arrests Them, Recognizing Friend's Son-in-Law

[Report from Our Newspaper] The apartment at No. 49 Chongqing South Road, Lane 169, namely Paris New Village, is where Jin Wenchao, who does business with a certain bank, lives. At around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, a bandit suddenly invaded the bedroom on the second floor under the pretext of inquiring about Ni Peiqing (Ni is Jin's nephew-in-law), threatened with a gun, and handcuffed the victim Jin Wenchao with his hands behind his back. He caught sight of his wife Yu's wearing a diamond ring and a red gem ring, and forced her to take them off, and asked where other ornaments were hidden? Ms. Yu replied that there were none, which angered the bandit. The bandit took out another pair of handcuffs, handcuffed her, and hit her on the head with the butt of the gun, causing her to bleed profusely. Jin Wenchao pleaded with the bandit, saying that if he wanted ornaments, he could allow her to borrow gold bars from Maochang Silver Shop at No. 505 Sichuan Road and pay him. The bandit ignored him and held on for an hour. Jin suddenly had an idea and pretended to run to the window and shout for robbers, fearing that the street police would arrive. Jin Wenchao followed and chased out, calling for help along the way. Seeing that the incident was exposed, the bandit quickly hired a rickshaw and headed east on Fuxing Middle Road. Coincidentally, there were patrol police officers at posts No. 4478 and 4967 at the entrance of Fuxing Park. Upon hearing the alarm, they bravely pursued and arrested the suspect at the entrance of No. 55 on the same road, seized a pistol with six bullets inside, and found the original stolen goods. The bandit was wearing a civilian police uniform and was taken to the Lujiwan Sub-bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, his name is Ni Pengqing, 29 years old, a local. According to the victim Jin Wenchao, he had just returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou the night before, and the bandit had been brought to his residence once by his nephew-in-law Ni Peiqing last June. Afterwards, Section Chief Hao led Inspector Ni's family, Police Chief Ma Bingzhang, to the scene of the incident to investigate. One side of the injured woman was accompanied by the police officer in charge to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Due to the blood concentration on the police armband, there were rumours of a policeman being shot.

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 11:10 a.m. yesterday, a batch of sulfur, a total of 100 barrels of cargo, was being loaded onto the No. 1 Wharf Warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau at No. 880 Dongdaming Road (i.e., Broadway Road). The warehouse manager designated it to be stacked in a mobile gold house shipped from the United States in order to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, the porters did not understand the principles of chemistry. During unloading, they allowed the flammable material to come into contact with the air, causing a fire and explosion shortly after entering the warehouse.

### Completion of Japanese Inspection Tour, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Arrives in Honolulu

[United Press, Honolulu, 27th] U.S. Secretary of the Interior Krug, after touring Japan and the Pacific, briefly stopped in Shanghai and is now en route to Washington via Honolulu. In a statement released today, he said that as soon as he arrives in Washington, he will immediately urge the transfer of Guam and other Pacific islands from military to civilian rule. Krug stated, "The Navy's performance is highly commendable," but "we feel that military rule is incompatible with the fundamental principles of American self-governance." He continued, "In Guam, I found that there were few remedies or avenues of appeal against naval administrative decisions, creating a sense of mistreatment among American civilian personnel and the indigenous population." He pointed out that this change will be gradual, as it involves Congress drafting legislation authorizing the government to administer the island and selecting a civilian administrative body. However, Krug also urged the Navy to continue providing practical assistance in maintaining transportation, health, and communication services, noting that the Army is also cooperating in the same mission in Alaska. Secretary Krug also stated that he was not surprised that the Soviet Union agreed to the U.S. trusteeship of former Japanese mandated territories, because while in Japan, MacArthur told him that "if we are firm and confident in our position in any region, the Soviet Union will accommodate us."

### Stalemate in Palestine Difficult to Break; Britain Considers Submitting to the UN General Assembly; White House Issues Statement Clarifying U.S. Position

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 26th] Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative to the United Nations, held talks with UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie today to discuss the possibility of convening a special session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the Palestine issue. Afterward, reliable sources said that Secretary-General Lie replied that convening a special session of the UN General Assembly would be difficult, with the issue of expenses being the most difficult to resolve, as convening the UN General Assembly would cost approximately one million U.S. dollars. However, if the British government formally submits this request, he is still prepared to consider it. Unofficial sources said that Secretary-General Lie and Sir Alexander Cadogan also discussed whether to submit the Palestine issue to the Security Council or the Trusteeship Council.

[Central News Agency, London, 26th, United Press] Senior British government officials recently announced that Britain is studying the possibility of submitting the Palestine issue to a special session of the General Assembly before the UN General Assembly convenes in September.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The White House issued a statement today, stating that the accusations made during the British House of Commons debate on the Palestine issue, which alleged that the United States' interests in Palestine and Jewish immigration were motivated by domestic partisan strife, were extremely disrespectful and likely to cause misunderstanding. The statement also said that the United States has a long-term interest in Palestine, and the American people, regardless of political affiliation, express deep concern. President Truman's statement on October 4, 1946, was intended only to reiterate his previous stance on Palestine and Jewish immigration, which he had expressed in the summer of 1945. This stance is based on the President's deep desire to propose a reasonable solution to the Palestine issue.

### The World's Attention on the Arctic

— This Newspaper's Research Department

...It is hoped that this place will become a major thoroughfare for the exchange of cultures and goods, and that the tragedies that have been played out in the Pacific will not be re-enacted here, defiling this pristine place with the evils of human civilization.

The Arctic has become the focus of attention for various countries competing with each other. This vast snowy sea will soon become a hunting ground for the aviation industry and the center of international competition. Humanity has been striving to conquer the two poles for over a thousand years. Initially, it was to explore scientific secrets, then to attempt to obtain some treasures, and now the purpose has shifted to national defense.

A Glimpse of Arctic Exploration History

As early as the ninth century, Norwegian navigators had visited the Arctic region, pioneering Arctic exploration. After the discovery of the American continent, many navigators and explorers believed that crossing the Arctic was a shortcut from the West to Asia. In 1553, the English explorer Willoughby set out from London, intending to be the first to traverse this shortcut, but unfortunately, he was blocked north of the White Sea, and all the crew members perished. In 1879, the Swedish explorer Nordenskiöld set out from Gothenburg, Sweden, and reached the Bering Strait, taking a year to complete this route for the first time. Afterward, others continued to venture there. In 1932, the Soviet icebreaker "Sibiryakov," led by Professor Schmidt, completed the voyage from Arkhangelsk to Vladivostok, marking a major advance in Arctic exploration.

Soviet Union Emphasizes Northern Sea Route

Most of the Soviet Union's coastline borders the Arctic Ocean, so it is most concerned about the Arctic. The Arctic Institute was established. After Schmidt opened up the Arctic Ocean route in 1932, it further aroused the interest of Soviet explorers. Subsequently, the icebreaker "Ruk" reached Murmansk from Vladivostok in just 83 days. In 1937, another feat of aviation exploration was successfully achieved. From then on, the Arctic, once considered a fantasy, no longer seemed mysterious. At the same time, the management of the Arctic became more concrete. The Soviet Union then built ports on the Lena and Yenisei Rivers, established radio stations on various Arctic islands, and added more than 50 Arctic stations to carry out research and construction work. The Soviet Union spared no effort in the excavation and management of this new land, achieving great success in recent years.

Apart from the Baltic Sea in the West and the Sea of Okhotsk in the Far East, the rest of the Soviet Union's access to the outside world is surrounded by icebergs and cold currents. In the past, the Soviet Union had been striving to find several ports for trade with the world. The construction of the Northeast Railway and the opening of the shipping route, and the attempt to seize the Dardanelles Strait from Turkey, were all based on the perspective of transporting goods. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian fleet had to detour around the Cape of Good Hope to reach the Japanese coast, a case of distant water being unable to put out a nearby fire, and ultimately suffered defeat. Since then, a direct navigation route must be opened up in the north, so the management of the Arctic has major military and strategic significance.

International Situation Around the Arctic

The Arctic is an area surrounded by the three continents of Asia, Europe, and America. If the North Pole is taken as the center, and several radiating lines are drawn along the coasts of various countries, dividing this circular land, then the Soviet Union is directly facing the center at an angle of 160 degrees, occupying four-ninths of the circumference. Next is Canada, occupying one-quarter of the circumference, Greenland occupies one-sixth, the U.S. state of Alaska occupies one-twelfth, and Norway is even shorter than Alaska. This radial circle represents the situation of various countries competing in the Arctic.

In terms of aviation distance, the distance from New York as the center, northwest through Alaska, across Siberia to Moscow, is over 10,000 miles. Westward through San Francisco, across the Pacific Ocean to Tokyo, it will be nearly 9,000 miles, and if you go east to Shanghai, it will also reach 10,000 miles. If you take the Arctic route, the distance will be greatly shortened. The distance between New York and Moscow is only 4,800 miles, New York to Tokyo is 6,900 miles, and to Nanjing it is only 7,500 miles. Compared with continental flight, it can reduce the journey by a quarter or even more than half.

Will Become an Aviation Shortcut in the Future

Air power has exerted tremendous power in World War II, and the invention of atomic energy has further enhanced the effectiveness of air power. In the future, air power will be of greater importance in national defense and strategy. This airspace surrounded by the three continents of Asia, Europe, and America is a navigational shortcut and will soon replace the Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Ocean and become a densely populated area of ​​aviation networks. It is hoped that this place will become a major thoroughfare for the exchange of cultures and goods, and that the tragedies that have been played out in the Pacific will not be re-enacted here, defiling this pristine place with the evils of human civilization.

### President Ho Chi Minh Renews Call for Peace

[Reuters, Saigon, 27th] Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh recently sent a letter to French President Auriol, asking him and the French people to declare their opinion on this senseless, bloody war. The letter, or perhaps Mr. Sainteny, the French Commissioner for Annam and Tonkin residing in Tokyo, will bring the letter back to Paris. The letter stated that the war is constantly increasing the suffering of Vietnam, and the French army's mission to restore peace and order is a lie, because there is no conflict where there are no French troops. We once again solemnly declare that our purpose is only unification and independence, and we are determined to respect the economic and cultural interests of France. America, as the pioneer of freedom, cannot fight against nations striving for basic rights. If France immediately orders a ceasefire, countless lives and property can be saved, and our friendship can be restored. Otherwise, France will lose everything and gain nothing. War only increases hatred on both sides. France may lack planes and tanks, but we have the firm will to back our reasonable demands. We do not believe that France is willing to continue this dishonorable war, so we ask the French government to clearly declare its policy towards the Viet Minh. Our purpose is clear, that is, to achieve unification and independence within the French Union, and we want a reasonable peace.

### International Monetary Fund to Begin Operations in March; Member Countries May Apply for Loans

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] IMF Managing Director Gutt announced today that the $7.5 billion International Monetary Fund will begin operations on March 1 to stabilize world currencies. Since May 6 of last year, the organization has established a secretariat, a review department, and a research department to study the economic conditions of member countries in detail. All member countries must pay their allocated amounts before March 1. Gutt will travel to London on March 22 to discuss plans for the Board of Governors meeting to be held in London in September with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton. It is reported that the IMF has 260 employees from 24 countries, including 176 from the United States and 6 from China.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] IMF Managing Director Gutt said yesterday that the Board of Directors' responsibilities, which are to maintain contact with member countries and guide them on the tasks they should fulfill to world organizations, are more important than managing the fund itself. He also said that member countries can borrow from the fund if they encounter urgent needs, but he hopes that borrowing will be kept to a minimum.

### McCloy to Succeed as President of the World Bank

[United Press, Washington, 26th] According to the Howard newspaper, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of War McCloy has accepted the position of President of the World Bank. The World Bank is composed of 40 countries, and the bank's former president, Meyer, resigned at the end of last month, so the bank has refused to issue any loans before a new president is appointed.

### American Scientists Discover the Secret to Longevity

[United Press, New York, 27th] Kemp, director of Winthrop Laboratories, and Tanenbaum, director of the laboratory's research institute, jointly announced that their research on improving blood may extend human life to 125 or 150 years.

### To Our Readers

— Pang Jingzhou

The Shen Bao's special New Medicine Supplement dates back fourteen years, named the Medical and Pharmaceutical Weekly. At that time, society and the medical community competed to expect this publication, and the contributors mostly wrote elaborate works. The author was fortunate to be associated with it. Later, it was edited by the Shanghai Medical Association and renamed "New Medicine and New Drugs," in order to standardize the name, until the war started and it was suspended. This is a brief history of this publication. Since the victory, the Medical Association has already been in charge of the People's Medical Journal. Now the Shen Bao has entrusted the responsibility of New Medicine and New Drugs to the Association, so it seems appropriate to call it a post-war restoration.

Having received this commission, we dare not fail to exhaust our thoughts to maintain the past honor and standing of this publication, and not to disgrace our mother publication. This is a wish that we share with all of you gentlemen.

Looking back at these fourteen years, the country has been tempered by the flames of war, and the people have learned from the lessons of war. To what extent has the promotion of scientific construction reached? What is the state of the scientific concepts that have been established and awakened? After examining this, one cannot help but feel saddened, and the duties of this publication are felt to be ten or a hundred times greater than in the past. This is a wish that we share with all of you to be vigilant about.

As for academic studies, they have no national boundaries, and culture should not be affected by partisan figures. We cherish the creations and efforts of the past, and we hope that those in the world who love this publication will continue to support it, and we further seek the resonance of all parties related to this publication. Sincerely written by Pang Jingzhou on February 19, the 36th year of the Republic of China.

Medical Administration Forum

### Discussing the Physician Certification Renewal and Physician Law, and Questioning the Highest Health Administration Authority

— Hua Xinren

The Ministry of Health recently published a notice for the re-registration and license renewal of physicians and prepared medicines. This work is very necessary. Because, how many doctors are there in our country? Even the highest Ministry of Health probably doesn't have an accurate answer. The reason for this, of course, reflects the Ministry of Health's lax management of medicine. In terms of personnel, this represents a kind of disorder, and in terms of management, it is unscientific. This license renewal also has its own internal contradiction, that is, the Ministry of Health has not grasped the regulations set by the Physician Law in the past. At the same time, there is also a sense of distress. That is, the issuance of license certificates in the past had some problems related to personal connections. Therefore, the current license renewal is used to make up for this defect. If we can really do well now, then it will be a success. Because it’s never too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost, right?

The Ministry of Health is the highest health nerve center in the country. Since the 17th year of the Republic of China to the present, it can be considered that the authorities have paid special attention to the fact that there is an independent health institution in our country's government departments. But where are the political achievements? The plague is prevalent everywhere, and the mortality rate is increasing as a percentage. There is a lack of health personnel, and the county-level health personnel are even more filled with incompetent people. The hospital equipment is incomplete, and there are too few beds... Does the health authority not admit these failures? Perhaps, the health authorities consider their success, or even think that they have contributed to today's medical and political construction, is the Physician Law promulgated by the National Government on September 22nd, 32nd year of the Republic of China. In fact, the result of this Physician Law is that the medical and political management has disintegrated, fragmented, and even stirred up an unbalanced situation between Chinese and Western medicine like the Sixteen Kingdoms of the Five Hus. If we analyze it scientifically, this kind of law can only be suitable for wartime organizations. Today, the Ministry of Health must feel it. The seriousness of the lack of medical talents, why can't the construction of public doctors be promoted? It is not about controlling it by re-registering and renewing certificates. There are many things to do, and the first thing is to revise the Physician Law. Revise it according to the current situation, social background, and what is truly helpful to the Chinese people. In other words, the Physician Law should be revised to become a regulation applicable to China. Don't aim too high, don't look for fish on trees, but look at the long-term perspective in a down-to-earth manner, and meet the needs of the people today. Refer to the scope indicated in Chairman Jiang's "Destiny of China" to formulate a good Physician Law. Otherwise, scientific medicine will inevitably collapse, and the political life of health administration will inevitably come to an end.

The first physician regulations in our country were the Provisional Regulations for Physicians promulgated by the Ministry of Health on January 15th, 18th year of the Republic of China, with a total of five chapters and twenty-five articles. At that time, the review of physician qualifications was conducted by a review committee organized by the Ministry of Health, which reviewed and issued certificates. Among them, the restrictions on physician qualifications are divided into four categories. In addition to those who passed the examination and those who obtained certificates abroad, the most important thing is that those who are over 20 years old and graduated from national or government-registered private medical colleges or above and obtained graduation certificates. Perhaps, at that time, there were very few medical schools, and the number of graduates was very small, so there were the above regulations. However, there was no mention of the certification of Chinese medicine practitioners. The second time was on September 22nd, 32nd year of the Republic of China, when it was promulgated by the National Government. The Physician Law promulgated this time is a formal law, because it went through the legislative procedures of the Legislative Yuan and was executed and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. This time, the Physician Law, with a total of six chapters and forty articles, deleted the general outline promulgated in the 18th year of the Republic of China, and changed the review committee of the Ministry of Health to "Citizens of the Republic of China who have passed the physician examination may serve as physicians," which invisibly weakened the Ministry of Health's independent review power and indirectly dealt a blow to the medical administration institutions. At the same time, it strengthened the restrictions on qualifications. That is, the examination for physicians is handled by the Examination Yuan in conjunction with the Executive Yuan. This means that the physician's certificate must first pass the Examination Yuan, and then the Ministry of Health completes the formalities. This Physician Law does everything possible to strictly manage Western medicine, but it humbly concedes to Chinese medicine everywhere. Let's take an example, the regulations in the first category of Article 3 of the Physician Law, such as: "Those who have obtained qualified certificates or medical practice licenses from the central competent authority or provincial and municipal governments," but we want to ask, on what basis did the central competent authority or provincial and municipal governments issue "qualified certificates" or "medical practice licenses"? In other words, according to which laws and regulations are these "qualified certificates" and "medical practice licenses" formulated? As citizens, we have the right to sue and question the Ministry of Health, what is "qualified," and where does this "qualified regulation" come from? Also, in the second paragraph: Those who have studied medicine in Chinese medicine schools and have excellent internship results and have graduation certificates. I don't know whether the so-called Chinese medicine schools studying medicine are the same as the regulations for Western medicine (public women or registered by the Ministry of Education)? I remember that last year the Ministry of Education instructed provinces and cities to crack down on Chinese medicine schools that were neither fish nor fowl, which shows that the operation of Chinese medicine schools is not good and the facilities are simple. May I ask, can this kind of internship be considered excellent results? The education authorities can understand the inside story of Chinese medicine education and take measures to crack down on it for the sake of the nation's health future. This kind of treatment is quite appropriate. However, when the Ministry of Health formulated the Physician Law in the first place, why didn't they think of this? Is it hatred for Western medicine or giving gifts to Chinese medicine? The most absurd thing is the third paragraph of Article 3 of the Physician Law: "Those who have practiced Chinese medicine for more than five years and have outstanding reputation." Obviously, this is an insult and destruction to scientific medicine. Chinese medicine practitioners only need "five years," but why can't Western medicine practitioners do the same? Is it that the theory and experience of Western medicine cannot catch up with the science of Chinese medicine? At the same time, it is even more difficult to give a boundary to "outstanding reputation." Is posting thank-you notes in newspapers and bragging considered outstanding reputation? Is introducing people considered outstanding reputation? Anyone with a little bit of common sense knows that this is a trick. Enough, this Physician Law drafted by the wartime Ministry of Health has 100% proved that it is driving the leadership of science backward, merely stimulating the disputes between Chinese and Western medicine, and disrupting the medical and political system. Thoroughly speaking, it is a complete failure.

Medical certificates can be divided into four categories in total. The earliest one is a "Special" certificate, and only a few people have received it. The second type is a "Medical" certificate, and most of them are graduates of formal medical schools. The third category is a "General" certificate, which is a kind of expedient measure for those who passed the examination held by the Ministry of Health in the 18th year of the Republic of China. The fourth category is a "Verified" certificate. During the war, because people needed to read and use it, the Ministry of Health came up with another method, recruiting some people with insufficient academic qualifications to serve for two years before issuing certificates. Because of the difference between these four words, there is a clear distinction in the medical field. Similarly, there is also a distinction between "I am above you." With proof of identity, it is easier to select true talents. However, recently, the Ministry of Health, regardless of the original policy, issued uniform medical certificates, treating everyone equally. In this way, it will inevitably make the management of the entire medical system more difficult in the future. That is, how to distinguish between formal doctors with sufficient academic qualifications and some parvenus and opportunists in terms of identity? Are graduates of formal medical schools willing to enjoy the same treatment as those without academic qualifications? Therefore, this time's license renewal, in addition to increasing personnel disputes, actually shows that the Ministry of Health's medical administration is a kind of unscientific management. I think the medical association should discuss this point.

Due to the provisions of the Physician Law, which stifled the progress of scientific medicine, the serious fact currently facing the health authorities is that during the war, there were quite a few people who participated in the military service and were appointed as physicians in formal hospitals, but did not receive physician certificates due to insufficient academic qualifications. How should the Ministry of Health deal with this matter to properly settle it? Should they take the exam? This means that their qualifications are not recognized. But why could they hold the position of physician during the war? Is it just to take advantage of them? At the very least, it's better than "practicing medicine for five years" and having an "outstanding reputation," right? At the same time, in this re-registration and license renewal, the Ministry of Health did not point out how to deal with "those who participated in enemy and puppet work"? We have some doubts. What about the Minister of Health of the puppet organization? What about the president of the puppet Central Hospital? However, we must not forget that people in the health field have "integrity." They participated in the eight-year war of resistance and lived a life of enduring hardship. After the victory, there should be a distinction between them and those treacherous doctors who participated in the puppet organization and were afraid of death. Otherwise, how can we be worthy of the medical colleagues who sacrificed their lives? To preserve our "righteousness," treacherous doctors must not be our companions.

The health administration authorities cannot bury their heads in the sand like ostriches to escape reality, but bravely face reality. Because what our compatriots urgently need is a practical health care undertaking. Clever theories and pleasant plans cannot cover up the people's discerning eyes. Franklin said, "One way a man may be sure he is neglecting his civic duty is when he begins to whitewash his public blunders." Therefore, I hope that the health authorities can know where to improve. As the saying goes, it is not annoying to use a straightforward way to make people work hard. If things are not fair, they will make a sound. This is the original intention of the author in writing this article.

Editor's note: The author of this article is a relatively progressive physician and also a worker working in a public health agency. This article purely objectively criticizes a part of the Physician Law. It is really a discussion of "the wise see wisdom and the benevolent see benevolence." Especially in the Ministry of Health, which recently issued the order of "re-registration and license renewal of medical personnel," it is really worth reading. Therefore, it is specially published here, and I hope that medical colleagues at home and abroad will discuss it together.

### The Physiology and Hygiene of the Circulatory System (Part 1)

— Fan Shouyuan

The word "circulation," literally, means continuous dwelling and revolving. Then, isn't this "circulatory system" the organs in the body that are constantly dwelling and revolving? We want to ask, in the human body, what exactly is this thing that is constantly dwelling and revolving? Who is it for that it is dwelling and revolving so constantly? In the human body, the thing that revolves and dwells day and night, to say it, everyone understands, is "blood." The revolving and continuous flow of this blood has a certain track, and this track is called "blood vessels." Therefore, the blood inside the blood vessels is like the water in the river. These kinds of blood vessels in the body are also divided into arteries, capillaries, and so on. Who is the blood residing in these blood vessels constantly dwelling and flowing for? In other words, what is the working task of its flowing and moving?

The movement of muscles relies on taking the nourishing substances of food and the oxygen in the air to exchange the waste substances accumulated in the muscles. This kind of work also has a scientific name, called "metabolism." However, the organ that mainly nourishes food is the digestive system, and the organ that mainly exchanges air is the respiratory system, such as the lungs. If there are no organs in the middle to perform the work of mutual contact and interconnection, then the air in the lungs and the nourishing substances in the stomach and intestines will have no way to be distributed to the whole body. The circulating task of the flowing and moving blood in the blood vessels is to specialize in a kind of contact work and interconnection work that carries the exchange of air in the lungs and the nourishing substances in the stomach and intestines to the whole body.

Let's use a metaphor to talk about the working condition of the whole body's blood circulation. It's like the railways and highways of a country. A country relies on the railways and highways as transportation to transport goods from the east to the west and move people and horses from the south to the north; otherwise, if a country does not have railways and highways, it will feel the inconvenience of transportation. This country, especially in the modern 20th century, will not be a country. Similarly, the human body has the work of blood circulation, so that the material nutrition in the body can have active work, in order to maintain a person's life. If the human body does not have this work of blood circulation for a day, the result, as everyone knows, is that it will immediately die. The reason is actually so simple that it doesn't need me to explain it.

Let's go back and say a few words about the blood, which is the main body of the circulation work.

Blood is spread throughout any part of the human body; therefore, the proportion of the amount of skin and body in any part: for ordinary adults, it accounts for one-thirteenth of the total weight; newborns have a little more, and the larger ones account for about one-nineteenth. The composition of blood is due to the liquid "plasma" and the solid "blood cells." These solid blood cells are divided into two types: "red blood cells" and "white blood cells." White blood cells are much larger than red blood cells, but the number is not as large as red blood cells: about the ratio of five hundred to one, that is, for every five hundred red blood cells, there is one white blood cell. The lifespan of these white blood cells is very short: about twenty days or so, they will die; after the old blood cells die, the blood cell manufacturing plants—bone marrow, lymph glands, spleen, and other manufacturers—will continue to manufacture new blood cells to supplement and replace them.

### Review of the Treatment of Tuberculosis with "Streptomycin" (2)

— Yang Shida

One of the most interesting things felt from the five surviving patients is that their previous progressive symptoms have been prevented by "Streptomycin," at least temporarily. One of them, who only suffered from miliary tuberculosis without minor meningitis, showed significant progress in both clinical and X-ray aspects after two months of treatment. The other four who had significant signs of meningitis including daily symptoms (fever, coma, headache, neck stiffness) and pathological spinal fluid and finding tubercle bacilli, all got good effects from "Streptomycin." This fact seems to prove that "Streptomycin" has considerable efficacy and is not prone to errors. In the past, H. Corwin Hinshaw had tried to treat this disease with other drugs, but had never found such an effect.

The relief of symptoms can be found after one to two weeks of treatment; after two to three weeks, the body temperature gradually decreases, and from the start of treatment, the body temperature can return to normal after four to eight weeks. At the same time, the patient feels generally comfortable, and coma, headache, and neck stiffness also disappear one after another. The phenomenon of spinal fluid, the relief of pathological conditions is very slow. During the treatment period, although the clinical symptoms gradually disappear, the spinal fluid always presents a more or less improper state. In the patients treated by Ying Xiao, only two spinal fluids almost returned to normal, but tubercle bacilli disappeared after a few weeks of treatment, and there was no way to prove its existence. This pathological state of spinal fluid, the fact that it cannot be completely eliminated (increased cells and protein and decreased sugar), although the existence of tubercle bacilli cannot be proved by the inoculation method, it should be considered that the infection may still exist. Among Ying’s five patients, three have been treated for six months and are under close observation. Two have maintained a good condition for two and three months. One patient relapsed one month after the treatment was stopped, and the treatment was continued again. This patient has lived for two more months since the recurrence, and has lived for ten more months since the start of treatment. However, all current cures are still not very reliable, and it will take a long time before these patients can be listed as "cured."

The pathological conditions left in the nervous system, three of the four patients with meningitis symptoms had it. One became blind due to tuberculous optic neuritis, and the other became deaf. Whether the cause of deafness is related to "Streptomycin" is still questionable (because "Streptomycin" often has side effects on the auditory organs). The third patient had a deep pathological condition in the cerebellum. The remaining patients have been treated for five months, maintaining a good condition, and can come to the outpatient clinic for treatment. Before the treatment, they did show severe meningitis symptoms.

Cooke and his collaborators have reported that "Streptomycin" stopped the progress of meningitis. There were six other similar reports, and private individuals have provided them to Ying Xiao.

The method Chen used to treat his four patients was to inject one hundred to two hundred cc through lumbar or cerebellomedullary cistern puncture every twenty-four or forty-eight hours for about two to six weeks. At the same time, intramuscular injections were performed, 2-3 cc per day, continuing for six weeks. After that, long-term observation was added. All those who died did not receive spinal injections, and all those who received spinal injections did not die.

In the treatment of tuberculous meningitis, extremely large doses of "Streptomycin" are injected intramuscularly and spinal cord in separate ways for a long time. Often such therapy can achieve at least several weeks or months of clinical effects. Regarding the early diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis, it is necessary to travel with extremely large doses of "Streptomycin" for intramuscular injections. Clinical, X-ray, and pathological tissue cures are possible, but according to the treatment experience of Ying Xiao et al., it cannot be confirmed. The treatment results of other types of tuberculosis will be discussed later when there is an opportunity! (To be continued)

### Regarding Several Questions About Smallpox Vaccination

— Editor

Several people have written to inquire about the procedure, advantages, and disadvantages of smallpox vaccination. I feel it is valuable to provide a comprehensive response, so I am addressing these letters first among the many received. Moreover, as smallpox is currently prevalent, and health authorities are repeatedly urging everyone to get vaccinated, this work can be considered timely.

We all know that smallpox vaccination is a very common thing, and we think it doesn't matter if it's done casually. However, some new parents are always worried and can't help but ask many questions: "When can smallpox vaccination be done?" "Should the first smallpox vaccination be done immediately after birth?" "What are the side effects of smallpox vaccination?" "Can smallpox vaccination prevent all other infectious diseases?" "After smallpox vaccination, should 'heating' foods be eaten to help the process?" These questions may seem trivial, but they are actually reasonable. I will answer each item as follows:

(1) "When can smallpox vaccination be done?" Many doctors advocate vaccinating children immediately after birth to prevent smallpox infection in advance. This reason is certainly correct. However, we should understand that smallpox vaccination (especially the first vaccination) is not a trivial matter. From the first day of vaccination until the scab falls off and it heals, it takes a full ten days or half a month. Moreover, the first vaccination is simply like causing a child to have a non-fatal infectious disease. If the child is not healthy, or if the child already has a disease, then smallpox vaccination can cause an adverse accident. Therefore, I must advise new parents: If you want your child to be vaccinated against smallpox, then first see if your child is healthy. If there is a cold, cough, or diarrhea, as well as eczema and other symptoms on the skin, then only wait for it to heal before vaccinating. Otherwise, it will only increase the burden on the child, worsen his condition, or make him prone to other diseases. Someone vaccinated a child with eczema, and as a result, the child developed eczema and pox all over his body, which was extremely dangerous. This must be known.

(2) "Should the first smallpox vaccination be done immediately after birth?" In Germany, doctors advocate that smallpox vaccination should absolutely not be done within four months after a child is born. First, because the child gets very little immunity from the mother and rarely suffers from smallpox. Second, because they are afraid that the child's resistance is too weak and cannot bear the arduous work of smallpox vaccination. This reason is quite reasonable. However, if smallpox is prevalent in a certain area, then all children in this area (except for sick children) must be vaccinated and can no longer be delayed.

(3) "What are the side effects of smallpox vaccination?" In the normal course of smallpox vaccination, some fever, restlessness, and diarrhea are not surprising. Some redness, swelling, blisters, pustules, and scabs at the vaccination site are all normal conditions and do not need to be worried about. However, if the vaccination site is abnormally swollen, or the redness and swelling turns purple-black and even forms a large abscess, and there is a high fever, then that is an adverse side effect. It is mostly due to incomplete disinfection during vaccination, resulting in the transmission of other germs (such as streptococcus or staphylococcus, etc.), and a doctor must be consulted for treatment.

Some children develop high fever and convulsions after smallpox vaccination, which may be a symptom of encephalitis and also require medical treatment, because it is the most dangerous disease.

(4) "Can smallpox vaccination prevent all other infectious diseases?" Many people think that smallpox vaccination can prevent other infectious diseases, which is absolutely impossible. However, I must tell readers that although smallpox vaccination cannot directly prevent other infectious diseases, it can enhance the body's immunity. Because experience tells us that after smallpox vaccination, many minor ailments are often reduced as a result.

(5) "After smallpox vaccination, should 'heating' foods be eaten?" In the folk, there is often a custom of giving so-called "heating" foods after smallpox vaccination, hoping that the smallpox will come out sooner. In fact, this is superfluous, and even if you eat "heating" foods, it does not necessarily come out sooner. We did not give him "heating" foods, and the results were often very good. So, this "heating" food can be avoided.

However, I must mention one point for clarification, perhaps because the previous smallpox vaccination procedure was incomplete, the smallpox vaccine was not pure, or because there was diarrhea during smallpox vaccination, so certain easily digestible foods were specially selected to reduce the burden on the child.

That's all for several questions about smallpox vaccination.

Viewing Hangzhou from a Purely Cultural Perspective - A Reporter Asks Mr. Xiong Foxi: Hangzhou Should Be a Cultural Capital - Buddhist Texts Truly Call Hangzhou a Transformation City

Spring, although its effects have already been noticed, quietly and secretly arrived on the shores of West Lake, but it pretends to be shy, half-covered and half-revealed, appearing and disappearing. These few days, it seems it can no longer bear it, revealing its clear and lovely self. The good sun covers the lake and valleys, wildflowers bloom in abundance, and the warm wind brings the fragrance of the soil. Streams and birds play together "the Song of Spring's Return."

Cars bring men and women from Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, and other places to explore the spring, and playwright Mr. Xiong Foxi and Miss Ye Zi also came at the right time. They came to see the reporter and only stayed for a day and a half. We went to Three Pools Mirroring the Moon to play in the water, strolled along Bai Causeway, explored the sacredness of Jingci Temple, tasted the spring at Hupao, overlooked the Qiantang River from the Liuhe Pagoda, and also paid respects at the Tomb of Yue Fei. To see the plum blossoms, we went to Gushan, but the effects were still shy and unwilling to be seen. Professor Zhang Junchuan from Zhejiang University said: "The plum blossoms in Lingfeng have already bloomed." So, we went to Lingfeng again. It is located on the road to Wangquan Temple. We hurried forward, bypassing a small hillside. A hint of green bamboo revealed half a corner of the red wall. Climbing the steps, we entered the temple gate on the left. There was a small plum grove, which had indeed bloomed with several branches, and the fragrance filled the entire courtyard.

Many Literary Figures Captivated by West Lake

Mr. Xiong Foxi said to the reporter: "Hangzhou is truly too beautiful; it should be the cultural capital." Yes, Hangzhou should truly be the cultural capital! It is located on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, and every day there is a direct train to Nanjing. It is surrounded by the Qiantang River and guarded by the Grand Canal. It is a land of fish and rice and also the home of aquatic vegetables. It has vast acres of fertile land and mulberry trees. It maintains a simple and honest style.

Many literary figures have bowed down for the beauty of West Lake in Hangzhou. Bai Juyi of the Tang Dynasty built a levee here to irrigate water conservancy. Later generations built Bai Causeway on West Lake in memory of him. Qian Miao of the late Tang Dynasty and early Song Dynasty gained the aura of the lake and mountains and maintained the safety of Liangzhe during the war. To this day, the Qian Gong Temple still stands on the shores of the lake, which is the scenic spot of Orioles Singing in the Willows. Su Shi of the Song Dynasty built Su Causeway on the lake. In spring, the six bridges are filled with misty willows, and the scenery is pleasant. Lin Hejing released cranes on Gushan, and the story of the plum blossom wife and crane son also originated on West Lake. During the Southern Song Dynasty, the poet prostitute Su Xiaoxiao's fragrant bones were buried by the Xiling Bridge, and even today, many people are captivated and pay their respects. During the Song Dynasty, Ge Hong refined elixirs on the Chuyang Terrace of Ge Ling. During the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Zhuanglie (i.e., Chongzhen) lived by West Lake. To this day, Hangzhou's "Lord Zhu Da Tianjun Bodhisattva" incense is most prosperous, which is to commemorate him. During the Qing Dynasty, Yu Quyuan lectured between Su Causeway and Bai Causeway. Kang Youwei once lingered in the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon of Xiaoyingzhou. Since the Republic of China, Su Manshu has been buried at the foot of Gushan. Wu Changshuo and others initiated the establishment of the Xiling Seal Carving Society on the Outer West Lake. Qiu Jin is also buried next to the Tomb of Yue Fei. Even the late Mr. Ye Chucang's dying wish was to be buried on the shores of West Lake.

Literary Style Once Flourishing, Now Decayed

In the past, Hangzhou's literary style was considered flourishing. There were Chongwen, Fuwen, and Ziyang academies, as well as the Gujing Jingshe for archeology and the Xiaoliantang for discussing articles. Even the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, preserved in the current Provincial Library, was copied and completed by many persevering people on West Lake.

Hangzhou has been a land of cultural relics in history, but now its content feels withered and decayed. Some say: "This is a political factor." Others say: "This is because the scenery is too gentle and beautiful, which makes people lack the courage to explore." I discussed this matter with Mr. Xiong Foxi and others for a long time. The conclusion we reached is that politics and scenery are not important factors. Hangzhou can still be the cultural capital of China. Because it is quiet, suitable for writers to write. It is beautiful, without the atmosphere of the market. It has convenient transportation, which can communicate all outside cultures. Moreover, there are dozens of printing houses in Hangzhou. Although the printing skills are not as good as Shanghai's, if true cultural people stay in Hangzhou and guide them, they may surpass Shanghai. At the same time, although the cost of living in Hangzhou is generally high, due to the simplicity of the citizens, the expenses are often much lower than in Shanghai. Although there is also a housing panic, the degree is much lighter than in Shanghai. It is a large park, and when you have nothing to do, you can row a boat on the lake or stroll along the causeway. Poor but noble cultural figures who love nature and need spiritual comfort should take Hangzhou as their home.

Academic Institutions - Hoping for a Large-Scale Relocation

Because of our sincere enthusiasm, Mr. Xiong will lead his theater school students to Hangzhou in mid-spring for a performance. At that time, he also wants to invite some well-known figures from the cultural world to Hangzhou. Of course, this is just a cultural activity. There is still a long way to go to build a cultural capital. However, we must have such a passionate expectation, we must shout so enthusiastically. Due to our expectations and shouts, we believe that we will definitely arouse people's attention.

We also hope that those who lead the whole country, lead Zhejiang, and lead Hangzhou must see through the position of Hangzhou in cultural value. We believe that it is not enough to build a garden city, and it is not enough to build an Oriental Hollywood. It should be built as a cultural city. In this regard, hard work will make Hangzhou full and rich, making people reluctant to leave. Therefore, many new academic institutions that the country wants to establish should be located in Hangzhou. Many universities that have no regional distinctions in name should be moved to Hangzhou. Even the Roosevelt Library, which is to be set up recently, we also have the necessity of requesting the Changju to consider relocating it to Hangzhou.

Looking around the country, Beijing originally had the reputation of a cultural city, but this was in the north, and at that time, it was only because of the political capital that literati gathered here. Now, many Beijing literati have come to the southeast. They are cramped in cramped rooms, breathing coal ash every day, and are familiar with the abacus calculations of brokers. Their thinking territory is so constrained by a family's livelihood that they can't breathe. Even if they have great ambitions and great writing, they are limited by the real environment.

Cultural figures are engineers of the human soul and jewels on the crown of the country. We must cherish them. We must choose good places and arrange homes for them.

Recent Developments in the Repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway - A Report from Wuyuan on the 17th

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is 1,008 li long, and with the Nanchang-Xunyang Line, it is 1,130 kilometers long. During the war, only the section from Shangrao to Jiangshan could barely be used. After the victory, the section from Hangzhou to Gaixia has been accepted and opened to traffic. Eighty percent of the entire line has not yet been repaired. This repair project was previously approved by the Ministry of Communications to repair Jinhua to Gaixia, Zhuzhou to Pingxiang first, but only one-third has been completed. The previously allocated funds have been exhausted and are insufficient, and a supplementary budget has been requested.

The main materials required to repair the railway are trains, rails, and sleepers. For the train item, it will be transported from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Jiangxi. The steps for the project are to first repair the Zhuzhou-Pingxiang, Nanchang-Xunyang, and Zhuji-Jinhua sections. The road surfaces with excessive curvature and unfavorable driving conditions will be renovated. As for bridges and culverts, the original foundation will be used as much as possible.

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Office in China, in order to assist in the repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, must first survey the entire line to understand the actual situation. The industrial rehabilitation engineer of the office, He Yier (K.V. Hoyer), etc., have drafted a rehabilitation plan, which will be assisted by the office. If the supply of materials and engineering is sufficient, it is expected to complete the entire line by the end of the year. (Ning Po)

Spring and Autumn

### A Discourse on Cats

— Mingchun

On February 7th, I read a "Cat Story" in a certain newspaper, and I was delighted to learn about the news of an old friend I hadn't seen for many years. Unfortunately, the content was all about foreign cat stories, such as Napoleon hating cats and Wellington loving cats. The only flaw was that the article still retained some unfamiliar words that could not be found in the English dictionary. I used to love these little animals. Let me talk about the cat stories I know.

The Book of Odes says: "There are tigers and cats." This animal has had a long history with the Chinese. It is strange that cats are not among the six domestic animals of "horses, cows, sheep, geese, dogs, and pigs." Moreover, the twelve zodiac animals discussed by Wang Chong, such as "rat for Zi, ox for Chou, tiger for Yin, rabbit for Mao…" do not have their place. So, we don't have people born under the sign of the cat. Not only that, "chickens and dogs are restless," indicating that cats are not the object of pity. "Singing, dancing, dogs, and horses" indicates that cats are not the object of love. While cats certainly cannot compete with dragons and tigers, the twelve zodiac animals have the status of hateful rats, scary snakes, and pitiful pigs, but no cat, which is somewhat unjust. If it is said that the presence or absence of cats is irrelevant to life, just imagine if they take a half-year vacation, wouldn't the rampant mice only be playing hide-and-seek by your pillow?

The Qing scholar Liu Xianting said that even immortals, Buddhas, ghosts, and gods have luck and misfortune, and that the reason is incomprehensible. He did not yet know that the fate of animals is also the same.

Cats can indeed develop feelings for people, but they are definitely not as loyal as dogs, following every step and listening to people's orders. Therefore, there are many loyal dogs but few loyal cats. Their personalities are stubborn, they love freedom, and catching mice is only half-hearted. They often eat the owner's food and catch the neighbor's mice. It is beautiful in the selfish view of human beings, so it is difficult to please the masters.

Many cats have developed feelings for me. I allow them to sleep next to my couch and "recite sutras." I often put my fingers into their mouths and let them bite as much as they want. They squat, look up, and sit, biting in various ways, but the force they use is moderate, and their fangs never pierce my skin. They also let me touch the fine thorns on their tongues.

They can be trained. Once, I was walking in a water town and found a boat of river and lake performers parked by the lake. A beautiful calico cat stood on the bow of the boat. I asked the boat owner: "When you dock in the water, isn't it difficult for the cat to urinate and defecate?" The boat owner proudly pointed to a large bamboo tube hanging at the stern of the boat and said: "That is the cat's toilet." He continued: "Cats on the boat never defecate anywhere; they always go to their special toilet and never make a mistake. This is the result of long-term training." Another time, I was eating a vegetarian banquet in a famous wealthy nunnery. Before the guests were seated, a small calico cat suddenly jumped onto the corner of the table, without making a sound or moving, and stared at the food dish on the table, without moving forward a step, as if it had come specially to visit. I took a piece of peanut candy from the dish and gave it to her, and she ate it elegantly at the corner of the table. "Er Zhu, um, good, come down!" a nun called her name, and she responded and jumped down.

The cats in this nunnery all have names, and the nuns can casually call a certain cat to do a certain action. For example, "San Shi, come up on my shoulder," and the cat named San Shi would jump onto the shoulder of the caller.

Another feature is that the cats in this nunnery are all vegetarians.

Bai Juyi said it well, "One can love small things." Indeed, all animals, including people, are always cute when they are young. Before cats learn to catch mice, they love to play the most. They can chase a withered flower blowing in the wind on the steps, catching it back and forth, seven times captured and seven times released, and continue jumping for more than an hour. Unfortunately, once they learn to catch mice, they become lazy in playing, just like a child grows up to an age where he understands things, has other desires, and is unwilling to play for the sake of playing.

I have observed the nature of many cats and found that they, like humans, also have innate intelligence and stupidity. Some are greedy by nature and do not keep to their duties. When eating, they are rude, and even climb into the food bowl with their front feet, desperately squeezing, making it impossible for their companions to insert. They even grab the fish mixed in the rice, dodge under the bookcase, and chew alone, making a whining demonstration in their mouths, strongly telling other cats not to get close to the rice bowl. That look is more imperialistic than Hitler. Some cats have very good eating habits, love cleanliness, and do not snatch food, and have a gentlemanly demeanor.

Cats are fond of fighting, especially in the cold winter, often fighting for love and jealousy, causing their fur to fly and their skin to break, resulting in mutual injury. They are irreconcilable and die hard to the end, unlike humans who fight and make peace. Some cats are isolated from other cats, forming their own sphere of influence, and suspicion arises when they meet, often causing fights. It is inferred that nations with little contact with the outside world are an ominous phenomenon.

Cats also pay attention to blood relations, but once their children can live independently, they no longer ask each other, which is quite similar to the family system of an industrial society.

Strangely enough, the more beautiful ones, such as the tricolor lion cats, are less able to catch mice. This is the same as the fact that decent "public servants" or "vases" in the human world cannot take on complex tasks.

The skills of cats catching mice vary greatly. There are stupid people who "carve a boat to seek a sword," and there are silly cats who "guard the hole and wait for the mouse." The spirited cat can monitor the jumping clown from more than ten feet away. With only a straight tail, it quietly draws a few circles, and then makes a shrinking and jumping posture, and the mouse is frightened and falls on its own. The principle is quite like the military exercises of a strong country.

To love the people by cherishing one's own relatives, to love things by being kind to the people, raising cats for leisure and catching mice at the same time is a win-win situation. It is a pity that in an era of chaos, people's own survival is threatened, and seeing the world, people have gradually regarded relatives as strangers and people as grass, and cats and dogs of different kinds have long been outside the circle of concern.

### Snippets on Poetry

— Lanben

Poetry may be an art of gaming, but at least it is a serious game, a game of truth, goodness, and beauty.

The method of creation is to constantly select, constantly allocate, and constantly update.

The process of creation is the completion of self-criticism, self-expression, and self-experience.

### Remembrance

— Yin Xueman

In the summer of 1938, I stayed in a small town in southern Shaanxi. Because this small town was nestled between the Qinling and Bashan Mountains, its climate was somewhat like that of Jiangnan. In June and July, days of intermittent sunshine and rain were common. However, we group of unrestrained and carefree young people, who would have been in the mood to plan for this? Therefore, within a quarter of an hour of leaving the house, I was caught in a downpour, and although I took shelter under someone's eaves, I was still drenched like a drowned chicken.

I can't remember why, but I needed to take a trip to the principal's house. At this time, although I hadn't considered my appearance or manners, and resolutely strode into an alley, I didn't expect that when I was almost at the principal's door, I was stopped by the sudden issue of appearance and manners.

In the misty drizzle, two beautiful figures walked ahead, and although their faces and hair were shadowed under a purple umbrella, I could deduce that they were beautiful. Especially that crimson cheongsam, it gave me infinite attraction.

I saw them standing in front of a door, the very door of the old principal's house.

Tap tap...

The sound of knocking on the door made me stop. I looked at myself, looked at them, and without hesitation, turned and fled from that deep alley.

It wasn't until the spring of 1939 that I had another chance to meet her, the girl in the crimson cheongsam. She was the younger sister of my classmate ×. × introduced us, and I brought up that scene from the summer of 1938. She said:

"Really? I didn't know! Otherwise, I would have taken a good look at your honorable appearance."

What a sharp tongue! I thought to myself. But I still smiled at her.

That was our first official meeting.

After that, time carried away five springs. In those five springs, we didn't forget each other. But unexpectedly, when the sixth spring came, I had already become a parent.

Are there some emotions? Being young, it's naturally not right to be emotional. But if someone has no longing or memory of the past, isn't that also unreasonable?

Therefore, it made me think about how different ideals and reality are.

Which young people don't have ideals? But the mistake isn't ours, even though we didn't build our ideals on reality. Because ideals and reality are too far apart, the result is inevitably that ideals become fantasies. But think about it, how much trauma can fantasies bring us?

In the past, we used to draw beautiful pictures of our ideals on moonlit nights. But the sad thing is that this society actually rejected the America drawn by ideals! Making ideals and life mutually destructive, so the ending for those who cling to life is always the same, and that is to throw the America of ideals into the dust of reality, letting it seal and shatter!

She left that small city that was both enchanting and tiring before I did. It was in the summer of 1940, when the fragrance of locust flowers still lingered in the green fields. Although separation made us sad, because we were pursuing that little bit of hope with a strong sense of fantasy, we finally held back our tears, smiled, shook hands, and said goodbye, parting on the dusty highway.

But just like a legendary novel describes, her experience is a moving story. The war made her dedicate unparalleled enthusiasm, making her escape her warm family and join a youth-organized work team, enduring the wind and dew, tasting unimaginable hardships. But unexpectedly, she was hit head-on! The work team disbanded due to lack of support and financial exhaustion; she had no choice but to come to this small city in the rear with a wounded heart.

I will always remember that group of young people, she said softly with a tone of contemplation and recollection: "They were young, enthusiastic, brave and lovely; but society didn't want them!"

I leaned silently beside her, gazing sadly at the night sky.

"What about the future?" she suddenly grabbed me and said loudly. "Hey, what's wrong with you?"

I smiled at her. She continued, "I'm thinking of going to the countryside to teach, to do something practical, what do you think?" She looked at me happily after speaking.

"I grew up in the countryside. People in the countryside don't even have enough to eat, how can they have time to study?"

"There's a way," she said confidently, "work and study at the same time! I hope to support my plan with small-scale chemical industries."

"Do you really want to do that?" I was a little incredulous.

Suddenly, I saw her face change. She said angrily, "You still don't believe me?" After speaking, she pushed me away and ran away regardless.

Compared to the past, we are much stronger today. Isn't it true that a young person initially has only unlimited enthusiasm, like anyone else, the tribulations of society will gradually make him stronger, no longer as empty as before. But when we accidentally meet on the street six years later and are shocked to learn that we have all become fathers, when we look at each other silently, those moonlit nights, those Qing talks, aren't they all as vague and distant as dreams?

Who is to blame? Is it that one's own willpower is not strong enough, one's aspirations are not firm enough? Or is it that one shouldn't have been so foolish in the past to draw one's own ideal picture; causing us to face each other silently today, our faces flushed red?

"Look, am I old?" she said.

I smiled. "Still very young!"

She glared at me fiercely. "Look how old my kids are!"

"Then, look at them!" I touched her child's head.

### Whitman Handbook

— Zhao Jingshen

Recently, Gay Wilson Allen published a book "Walt Whitman Handbook." Now, even in the United States, I'm afraid few people read Whitman's poems, and not many families have Whitman's "Leaves of Grass." Poe and even Emerson's poems have been reprinted, but Whitman is only occasionally selected by anthologists.

Naturally, he should be included in the ranks of famous writers. But besides young people with passionate interests, who else would be willing to read it! Only composers still use his poems to sing, and university poetry classes still read his poems.

Allen mentions in this Whitman handbook that Whitman is truly a poet of the world, and he has had a great influence on various countries. Poets from England, France, Germany, Russia, and South America have all been influenced by him. His reputation outside the United States is equal to that of Goethe, Hugo, or Tolstoy. The French symbolists also worshipped him. Gide thanked him for saving his mental breakdown, making him feel the unity of all creation. In Germany, before the First World War, Whitman almost became an idol in the cultural world. Thomas Mann said in 1920 that his works were influenced by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.

Everyone knows to compare Whitman with Rossetti and Swinburne. But people wouldn't think of Tawden and Sanjivali praising Whitman. Wang Er, Romain, and Gide's praise is also understandable, as for Laforge and Duhamel being Whitmanesque, no one would think of it.

Yesterday, Chapter 6, "Whitman and World Literature," was the best written, and the other five chapters are also readable. There are extremely many reference books; named handbook, its value is really above the handbook. From Oconnor in 1866 to Canby in 1943, he collected all the biographies for comparison. He also translated and used the comments of the Danish writer Frederik Schyberg, which are especially valuable after he introduced them for the first time. He also used many versions of Leaves of Grass, up to the seventh edition in 1882.

Allen also narrates Whitman's basic concepts and social thoughts, but he is very careful not to let his narrative of thinkers take up too much space. He wrote Whitman as the sum of many forces, which is why materialists, idealists, naturalists, nationalists, socialists, and symbolists all praise him. He motivates the joy and courage of others.

In terms of rhythm, Whitman followed the writers of the nineteenth century, experimenting with organic rhythms, as Arnold, Tennyson, and others tried. His poems, as Bradley showed, have a harmonious rhythm, unlike recent free poems that are too indulgent. There are many ways to do this, which is learned from the Bible. Longer poems even use operatic techniques, and he almost became a composer himself. Allen's chapter on Whitman's skills is also well written. Unfortunately, two points were overlooked by Allen: one is symbolism, and the other is imagination.

### Remaining Words of the Double Jade Studio

— Hong Weifa

Figures are like water plants on the bank, the mountains and rivers are in the sounds of drums of war; It is good to chant "Liangfu Yin", but do not write in vain, the charming reds and tender greens are the spring breeze before the eyes. Appreciate the intimate feelings, the conduct is all the same, the sorrow of parting is not like the water flowing east. May I ask how many times the moon will be full before we meet again?

A Ladle of Pearls

Leisurely watching the morning sun beside the pillow, gradually gathering towards the window, today's wind and rain should have no basis; Check the kit, pack up the spring travel phrases. Buy wine and leisurely search for the path by the stream, the spring waves are greener than when I crossed before, the water fields are vast and the seagulls fly; I also forget to return, not drunk and not going home.

Sheng Zha Zi

The wind and dew look into the night, the morning sun drives away the dark night, how many people cherish the spring, indulge in the light of heaven. Leisurely searching for old travel traces, the scenery is all like paintings, the willows are swaying, everywhere are those who forget words.

Eyes of Charm

The old paulownia trees in autumn are dotted with crows, the cold moon soaks the yellow flowers; Unable to sleep late at night, lingering in the east, how can I bear the beauty of spring! Difficult to hate the gray hair, helpless is the sad flute; In a few days of spring breeze, Jiangnan will be green again, green to the ends of the earth.

Partridge Sky Using Jiaxuan Rhyme

One layer of clear waves, one layer of sorrow, but teach to miss the tenderness after parting, the brocade scales are hidden and there is no news, pointing to the south and north of the sky. The golden drums are vibrating, when will they rest, the longing is entrusted to the highest building, the flat boat also wants to find the fragrant traces, the water is far and the mountains are long and not free.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 185

— Ye Jingfeng

As soon as the order was issued, the leaders of each group gradually withdrew, leaving only one or two workers in charge of temporary "突" dispatch, and there was still a bit of planning, suddenly seeing the door open, a duty officer came in suddenly, reporting "A guest is asking to see you," just saying the name, only to see Tsurumi, already hurrying into the room, his movements not as peaceful as usual, and his face pale;

"Very rude..." The sound of the word "见" carried a very strong Japanese intonation. This is the phenomenon when people are in a hurry - their minds are not on, and they temporarily make a foreign accent that is neither fish nor fowl - just saying these four words, seeing two particularly eye-catching figures in the seat, he immediately swallowed the words he was about to say. Mr. W was so alert, observing his words and expressions, he already knew that Tsurumi was so hurried, there must be a change in the situation, and he also knew why Tsurumi swallowed his words, and immediately sent out those two comrades of his subordinates, nodding and smiling at Tsurumi and several of us:

"Let me introduce you..."

The two who were sitting on the side, seemingly guests, stood up immediately; the four of us, including Tsurumi, also took two steps forward. Mr. W used his hand to invite a shorter one, and said to us:

"Our Bureau's Chief Director - Mr. Dai!"

This surprised us all. Mr. Dai's reputation can be said to be like thunder to our group of people. His actions have always been like a dragon, unpredictable; at this time, he was clearly standing in front of us with a smile, but I couldn't quite believe it.

"This is Mr. Dai's English secretary, Mr. Ma." Mr. W introduced another taller guest.

We all shook hands and greeted each other, and Mr. W also explained our names.

"Let's skip the formalities, Mr. Gu seems to have something to discuss, please proceed as usual."

Mr. Dai rarely said three sentences in one breath in ordinary situations other than meetings and reports, Mr. W told me this later in a casual conversation.

Although he doesn't like social interactions, he never utters a word even at certain meeting occasions, but if you pay attention, he is always conveying his thoughts. When necessary, his gleaming eyes will also "speak", a wave of his hand, a tilt of his head, even complete silence, are a kind of silent language.

I have seen many, many silent people, that is just a cold calmness, or an acquired cleverness; they give people the impression of only a kind of dullness, making people feel unusually unapproachable, these people, judged harshly, can only be said to be lonely, or speaking mutes.

Mr. Dai is not like that; although he doesn't talk much, you never feel that he is calm among the crowd; on the contrary, he is very lively; because the tools that represent him to express or convey his thoughts are not words, but multifaceted hints. Even though he doesn't make a sound, he has already answered your question. Whether he approves of your opinion or does not accept it, he only needs to glance at you with his eyes, or look at you meaningfully, and you can understand, which is clearer than a long explanation. Sometimes he spits out a word, or a short sentence composed of two or three words, which can pinpoint the key points that you need to say but cannot say clearly, like opening a door to see the mountain.

Freedom Talk

### A Young Man's Ambition

— Mei Bai

There is a play in Beijing opera called "A Young Man's Ambition", which is actually another name for "Bidding Farewell to His Wife to Join the Army". Xue Pinggui and Confucius's highly accomplished disciple Yan Hui have very different interests. He is unwilling to live a poor life in the cold kiln, so he resolutely bids farewell to his young and beautiful wife and goes out to join the army, resulting in a triumphal return and a happy ending.

The ambitions of today's young people are indeed not small. Confucius at fifteen was determined to "learn", but the ambitions of today's young people are different from those of Confucius - having nothing to do with learning.

What are their "ambitions"? Don't you see that the students of Zhongzheng University beat up the principal Xiao, and Suzhou, which has always been famous for producing "literary ruffians", also has a large group of middle school students who stormed and destroyed the "Su Bao" hall?

Therefore, it is said that today's young people are determined to "fight"! This is also an example of the progress of the times.

### Remainder of the Remainder

— Lei Ke

Since the victory, I have been a person who buys a lot of surplus canned food from the US military, for no other reason than for economy.

The name "surplus" is naturally not very pleasant, like wearing someone else's old shirt, or eating someone else's "leftover rice water". However, we are such a country that uses old goods, plays antiques, and talks about national essence, using other people's surplus probably doesn't increase shame.

Many years ago, someone reported that some people in Shanghai bought the leftover food from foreign ships and resold them as Western food. But this news does not prevent me from going to small restaurants, nor does it prevent other compatriots. We need such low prices. We need to live, like rats in garbage cans, and those big and small beggars who rummage through garbage.

Recent news says that the moldy and spoiled goods purchased by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) were stolen and sold publicly in the market when they were dumped into the sea. This remainder of surplus materials is said to be poisonous to eat, and of course it is dangerous. But until now, I have never stopped buying cheap canned food. I eat these canned foods almost every day like a lonely and greedy rat, and throw the leftovers in the corner, letting the cats and rats eat again. Until now, I have not been poisoned, nor have I seen a cat retch, as for the corpses of rats, I have not seen one.

We probably all have a disinfected stomach, just like being able to eat centipedes and spiders

In my memory, two people once gave me "surplus" things, one was a bottle of something like "malt extract" that had solidified like iron, and the other was two slices of Takahashi muffins with a layer of green flowers on top. I couldn't eat the former. The layer of green flowers on the latter scared me. As a result, one went into the hands of a recycler, and the other was dried in the sun on the windowsill for many days and taken back by the original sender. Even now, when I think about it, I regret not eating it, I don't blame those two well-intentioned people, because they were originally compatriots who ate the leftovers of others, how would they know that those two things were not also the remainder of the remainder?

### Hundred-Foot Building

— Hu Lu

Former traitors often live, today's loyal supervisors live, happily moving into the tall building with good equipment, better than living in an apartment!

As long as you have talent, don't worry about work, how many people returned with victory, unemployed and without a place to live!

Note: It is seen in recent news in this newspaper that traitors in Shanghai will be given jobs and moved to the new six-story detention center.

Convicts after being pardoned

Pardoned from suffering hunger and cold, falling into love and greed, being unfree is still abominable, what's wrong with committing crimes again!

Sentencing is not allowed, but evil deeds are treated preferentially; Don't you see the foreign-style house is fully equipped, the traitor's heart is happy?

Note: In Shanghai dialect, going to prison is called "falling into it".

### Listening to Opera and Watching Opera

— Song

People in the north say "listening to opera", people in the south say "watching opera". I think that only when sound and appearance are both excellent is it a good opera, why should the ears and eyes be partial to one or the other? The Beijing court faction emphasizes those who listen to opera, not going to the balcony seats, not going to the ground floor seats, but sitting against the large wall, listening quietly with their eyes closed, which is considered the best. The so-called "large wall" is the last row of the two corridors downstairs, the seats closest to the stage, they may only listen to a certain person, or only listen to a certain opera, or even only listen to a certain section of a certain opera; male roles such as "Hong Yangdong" from that day, "Zhaoguan" and "Catching and Releasing" of a round moon, "Fenhe Bay" and "Wujiapo" , "Visiting Mother" of Sitting in the Palace, "Kongcheng" of the City Gate; female roles such as Yu Tangchun, Sacrifice to the River, Sacrifice to the Pagoda, June Snow, etc., all choose the most exciting section, and leave without looking back after listening. On the same day and at the same venue, even if there are other good dramas, they must not listen.

The second best is to sit in the small pool in the upper and lower stages, the third official in the upper and lower stages upstairs. These positions are often contracted by someone, or reserved by the theater for powerful people. The large restaurants in Shandong Pavilion, such as a certain hall and a certain residence, can also make reservations. If you rely on the big wall, then you don't need to set up this shelf here, you can sit as soon as you arrive, coming the latest and leaving the earliest, all those who sit in the front balcony seats and other balcony seats on both sides are old-fashioned. Only the middle room in the front balcony is reserved for the censors of the Metropolitan Procuratorate and the Censor of the Southern City Patrol in the Five Cities, either to invite guests or for their own use. On the morning of that day, if the discipline is not assigned, it can also be sold, which is not like the front row in the Beijing and Tianjin downstairs in recent days, which must have police seats. Beijing officials and their children who are old in Beijing, known as opera fans, must listen and use them personally, and they are not infected with the urban opera listening habits, and they are the most numerous in the back rows of the pool seats. I am very fond of opera, and I must sit in the front pool seat in the middle, arriving at the theater the latest and arriving at the seat the best. In fact, there is no other trick, but I am not stingy with tips for the seat master (that is, the usher in Shanghai theaters). Friends are surprised and think it is strange, and those who imitate what I do cannot get the same results as I do. Dong Xianjun served as the vice-censor and censor for a long time, and the theater also gave special preferential treatment. There are inside stories everywhere in society, even such a small matter as watching a play is like this, it is worthy of叹.

### New Analects

— Yuan Qin Sun

The Master said: Do not look at anything without profit, do not listen to anything without profit, do not say anything without profit, do not do anything without profit. (In today's world, only profit is sought).

The Master said: To let go of profit and not act will cause much resentment. (High interest rates, lending at a discount, and some borrowers do not repay the principal and interest, how can one not resent?)

The Master's leisure living is stretched and shrunk. (In the era of housing shortage, one can only shrink in the pigeon cage.)

Zigong said: If there is gold here, seek a good merchant to sell it. The Master said, "Sell it, sell it! I am waiting for someone to buy it." (Zhonghang only collected 480,000 gold, those who hide gold cannot sell it at a good price.)

The Master said: The party exists, not yielding to the teacher. (In the university strike wave, the principal was also beaten, and the students also had party opinions.)

Once Zengzi had no illness, he summoned his disciples and said: "Disable my feet, disable my hands, the Book of Songs says 'Be cautious and apprehensive, as if facing a deep abyss, as if treading on thin ice', and now and hereafter, I know I am exempt from labor." (A certain villager cut off his feet to avoid military service, which is also pitiful.)

### Churchill and the Carp

— Chen Xiang

After the fall of France, in this defeated country, a meaningful fable was whispered among the hopeful people. The "heroic" humor of this fable proves that the French people deeply believed in the stubborn people across the English Channel and their final liberation. The fable said:

In July 1940, when Britain was fighting alone, Hitler invited Churchill to Paris for a secret meeting. After Churchill arrived in Paris by plane, he was escorted to Fontainbleau, where Hitler and Mussolini were waiting for him around a tea table, which was placed right next to the famous carp pond.

Hitler wasted no time: "This is where I want to talk to you, Churchill! Britain is finished. Sign this treaty, admit that Britain has been defeated, and the whole of Europe can have peace tomorrow."

"I'm sorry, I can't sign." Churchill replied quietly: "I don't agree that we have been defeated."

"Ridiculous!" Hitler roared, slapping the table, "Look at the obvious facts!"

Churchill sipped his tea. "In England," he said, "we often resolve disagreements with bets. Would you like to bet with me? The loser has to agree; he has been defeated."

"How to bet?" Hitler asked suspiciously.

"Do you see those big carp in the pond? Well, let's bet: whoever is the first to catch a carp without any normal fishing gear is the victor of the war."

"Bet!" Hitler yelled, he quickly pulled out a volley pistol and continued shooting at the nearest carp. The pistol was empty, but the water deflected the bullets, and the carp continued swimming undisturbed.

"It's your turn, Old Mo!" Hitler roared, "They all say you're a great swimmer! You jump down!"

Mussolini took off his clothes and jumped into the pond, but as soon as he grabbed the carp, the carp slipped out of his grasp. Finally, exhausted, he climbed up noisily with empty hands.

"It's your turn, Churchill!" Hitler said with gritted teeth, "Let's see how you do it!"

Churchill calmly dipped his teaspoon into the pond, scooped up a teaspoon of pond water, and then threw it over his shoulder. He repeated this continuously.

Hitler stared with his mouth open, "What are you doing on the ground?" he asked impatiently

"This will take a long time." Churchill looked at the water and replied, "But we are on the way to victory!"

### The Worries of Selling Writing

— Lu Siqi

Selling writing was originally a painful task, especially today. Since last year, prices have been rising like a whirlwind, but the only income for writers, the manuscript fees, remain stagnant! Therefore, I often say to my wife, "If only prices could be as stable as manuscript fees, you wouldn't have to worry about making ends meet!"

A few days ago, the poet Zang Kejia wrote a rallying article about the issue of increasing manuscript fees. The editor also chimed in with a few words, saying that it should be increased by 20%.

In fact, an increase of 20% is not much. Take manuscript paper as an example, two or three weeks ago, a ream of forty sheets of paper that cost a little over a thousand dollars has now risen to over five thousand. Other things that writers cannot live without, such as ink, cigarettes, pens… all are increasing in price, and the increases are quite fierce.

If we look at it in proportion to the price increases, a 20% increase in manuscript fees is indeed a fair request. But even such a fair request, who knows when it can be realized.

High prices and low manuscript fees are certainly the misfortunes of writers, but currently, the biggest misfortune for writers is not just the manuscript fee problem alone, but rather the shrinking newspaper space, magazine closures, and bookstores refusing to accept manuscripts…. If the publishing industry continues like this, even if manuscript fees increase, our misfortune will still not be resolved.

I am a writer, and I hope to increase manuscript fees, and the higher the better. However, if the outlets for our writing become narrower and narrower, even to the point of completely cutting off the outlets, and we cannot even get the lowest manuscript fees, then that is the greatest misfortune for writers.

### Another Hero – A Record of the Righteous Act of Bravery by Dickson

— Ding Ankang

I remember after the "Miss Luzon" plane crash, newspapers competed to publish photos of the affectionate dancer Li Sulan, because of her rescue of fellow injured dancer Luo Jun, unfortunately she herself tragically drowned, her story was both heroic and poignant. Recently, a friend, Mr. Sheng Shuhang, also a passenger on the plane, returned to Shanghai after escaping from Manila. According to him, after the plane crashed, there were cries for help in the cabin. Fortunately, among the passengers was an American sailor named Dickson, who, seeing the situation, jumped into the water and displayed his spirit of universal love, regardless of nationality or gender. First, he helped everyone onto the rubber lifeboats. A total of twenty people, including Dickson, were rescued. Then he connected the three boats with ropes. However, because people were not skilled at inflating, there was not enough air, and the boats almost sank. Dickson then held the rope in one hand and swam back and forth between the three boats, inflating them one by one. Only then did the three boats turn from danger to safety. From the time they boarded the boats at 3 p.m. until they were rescued the next day at noon, some people on the boats were extremely anxious, and some were sobbing uncontrollably. In addition to rowing, Dickson lowered his head and prayed for others. His righteousness and enthusiasm were inspiring. When everyone escaped danger and landed, some offered him money, but he refused to accept it, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. Therefore, I supplement this record to inform the world.

### Discussing Not Using Allusions – New Words on Couplets, Part Three

— Tingsong

A couplet that integrates idioms is, of course, superior. Using allusions is secondary. If it is based on a specific matter and must use common words, but can still be elegant and generous, it can also be called a master in this field. There is a certain bureau in Beiping, with an extremely lucrative position. The director, a certain person, was quite fond of doing good deeds. In a certain winter, it was extremely cold, and those freezing and starving were visible everywhere on the roads. In addition to generously assisting various warm food centers, the director also independently opened a porridge distribution center, donating 300,000 yuan. The more than 3,000 employees in the bureau also donated as much as they could, raising another 300,000 yuan. Among the twenty-odd centers in the city, this center, with its abundant funds and diligent staff, was considered the most successful.

That year was the director's fiftieth birthday, and his birthday was on December 27th. The employees in the bureau jointly wished him a couplet. The wording was very elaborate, but a certain chief secretary was very frugal and insisted on using the words "porridge distribution", saying that the director prided himself on this as a heroic deed and should not be written vaguely, and that his birthday at the end of the year should also be relevant. There was a scholar in the bureau who was also a respected elder from the south. He created a couplet that said: "Distributing porridge saves ten thousand people, this is benevolence and longevity; celebrating the year three days early, first obtaining the spring of energy." This couplet used common words and was accurate to the three days before New Year's Eve, and was truly a work that could be appreciated by both the refined and the vulgar. The tone was also very grand, and it was widely circulated as a famous couplet. This matter was told to me by the late Zhao Jianqiu. Jianqiu also said that the director was not very familiar with writing, but liked to embarrass people with difficult questions. If common words were not used, he would consider it not good. One of his relatives, a certain lady, had many children and grandchildren. She passed away at the age of sixty-nine at the end of the year, just one day before the beginning of spring. It was proposed to give a mourning couplet, and it was indicated that he did not want to use allusions. The elder also created a couplet that said: "Tomorrow is the new spring, why does Heaven begrudge an ancient rare age; the elevated age set an example, all praise the person of great fortune." Although this couplet is not as elegant and generous as the previous one, Jian Lao said that the subject matter was already old-fashioned, and it had to be a straightforward description, without using allusions, and it was surprisingly able to express the meaning in plain language. There was also no trace of artificiality, and the matching of "Heaven's heart" and "public opinion" was extremely meticulous. It can be said to be very rare. Jian Lao regarded the elder as a lonely person in the world and expressed deep sympathy, so he refused to reveal his name.

### The Misfortune of the Newspaper Industry

— Ma Jin

Some time ago, the national newspaper industry, burdened by the sharp increase in telegram costs, made repeated appeals and pleas, begging the government to consider the plight of the newspaper industry for the sake of culture and to formulate a special preferential measure for news telegrams. In fact, these appeals did not produce satisfactory results. Who knew that not long after, the government would issue a decree restricting the import of paper, which is tantamount to giving the already precarious newspaper industry another dose of tiger-wolf medicine.

The result of the sharp increase in telegram costs and the restriction on paper imports is that, in order to cope with the crisis, newspaper offices with a more stable foundation have been forced to adopt unfortunate measures such as reducing space, raising newspaper fees, and massive layoffs; while newspaper offices that were already struggling to survive have simply closed down; as a result, newspaper sales have decreased, and a group of outstanding individuals have become unemployed.

If China still needs culture, then the new and nascent newspaper industry should only be helped and not destroyed; if China still needs education, then newspapers are the most convenient way of social education and mass education; if the government still remembers public opinion, newspapers are reliable and the most representative public opinion organs; if the government still plans to implement constitutionalism, then the democratic tasks undertaken by newspapers cannot but be promoted.

For this reason, the Shanghai Newspaper Association has already sent representatives to petition the authorities. I hope they are tough!
