### Severe Drought in North China; Agricultural Harvests Cause for Concern

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] North China has experienced a severe drought since spring, and northern agricultural production is facing a serious crisis. Feng Zefang, director of the Beiping Cotton Production Improvement Office, said: This year, a widespread drought has occurred in various provinces in the north, especially during the planting season in March, April, and May. There was no rain in Beiping in April, and 1.2 millimeters in May. Only 19.8 millimeters of rain fell on the evening of the 28th in southern Hebei. Even if it rains again in the future, it will not be of great use, because the agricultural season has already been missed. The wheat is approaching the harvest period, and many cotton seedlings have withered. Feng looked frequently at the snowless sky outside the window and told reporters that this year's drought is unprecedented in more than 30 years, only comparable to 1914. Not only are cotton fields severely affected, but other crops are also affected during their growing period. This year's agricultural output is truly cause for concern.

### National Economic Commission to Meet Next Week; Discuss Collection of Property Tax; Concrete Measures to Be Decided for Balancing the Budget; 350,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Arriving Sequentially

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The collection of property tax is imperative. The National Economic Commission will hold a meeting on the 10th to conduct concrete discussions on this and may make some decisions. It is heard that some people in the government advocate that local public opinion institutions should compile a list of wealthy families to serve as the target for taxation, but there may be some technical difficulties in this matter. It is also heard that the future property tax will adopt a one-time property tax method and adopt a progressive system, with those with more property paying more tax.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] At the last meeting of the National Economic Commission, it was decided on the economic emergency measures plan to推推定 members be divided into five groups for balancing the budget: (1) military expenses, (2) food, (3) finance, (4) the sale of state-owned enterprises and enemy and puppet properties, and (5) the reduction of general government agency expenses, to study in detail ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. It is understood that the first group held a meeting on the 3rd and submitted a report, the fifth group is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 6th, and the other three groups will also be held this week. The opinions of the working groups will be summarized and discussed at the meeting on the 10th to determine effective policies and concrete measures. Furthermore, the National Economic Commission, according to Article 8 of the organizational regulations, will establish a special materials committee as necessary in fact. Its work includes the supply of grain, fuel, the distribution of daily necessities, the distribution of U.S. surplus materials in China, and the detailed measures for handling the U.S. $500 million loan of materials. Zhang Qun and other major responsible persons are discussing the details.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The government has concrete assurance in solving the rice problem. Starting this month, 350,000 tons of foreign rice will be shipped to China sequentially, which is expected to be completed in four months. It is estimated that it can at least solve the one-year needs of 6 million people in coastal cities. Of this 350,000 tons of foreign rice, 50,000 tons are shipped from various places in Southeast Asia, and the remaining 300,000 tons are purchased with funds allocated by the United States to aid China. After the foreign rice arrives, it will be universally distributed to public school teachers, military personnel, and laborers in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places so that they will not be oppressed by food prices, and rice prices in various places can also be suppressed as a result. The proceeds from the sale of foreign rice purchased with U.S. relief funds will be used to fill the relief fund. Furthermore, in order to prevent a sharp drop in rice prices due to the arrival of a large amount of foreign rice, which would affect farmers, the authorities will not adopt a method of large-scale distribution in the market.

### Government Official Disciplinary Committee Decides to Reprimand Bei Zuyi; Wang Songtao Dismissed and Suspended from Employment for One Year

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The case of Bei Zuyi, the former president of the Central Bank and key figure in the gold speculation case, and Wang Songtao, the former assistant manager and head of the cashier's office of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, for illegal dereliction of duty, was previously submitted by the Control Yuan to the Government Official Disciplinary Committee for review by the National Government. The review has now been completed and it has been resolved that Bei Zuyi be reprimanded and Wang Songtao be dismissed and suspended from employment for one year. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

Main Text

Bei Zuyi: Reprimand; Wang Songtao: Dismissal and suspension from employment for one year.

Facts

In February of the 36th year of the Republic of China, when price fluctuations were severe and had a significant impact on people's livelihoods, the Control Yuan ordered members He Hanwen, Gu Fengxiang, Zhang Qingzhen, and Wan Can to jointly investigate whether the Central Bank had improper measures and other circumstances in executing the gold trading business. The investigation revealed that Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, director of the Business Bureau, Yang Anren, deputy director, and Wang Songtao, assistant manager and head of the cashier's office, had the following illegal acts and dereliction of duty: (1) The gold reserve base of the Central Bank is related to state organs and has a significant impact on the future of the gold policy. However, Bei Zuyi, the president of the bank, and others sold all the gold bars and handed them over to Tongfengyu Gold Firm to be responsible for distribution, and the seven gold firms like Dafengheng melt into gold bars, instead of handing it over to the Central Mint for melting. The quantity of melting amount by Central Bank, and Tongfengyu knew it clearly. Then the central bank's designated five firms must be signed by Zhan Liansheng, the host of Tongfengyu Gold Firm, before they can be picked up. Therefore, the total amount of gold sold by the Central Bank was fully known by Zhan Yunsheng, and it was not difficult to use this total amount to infer the amount of gold stored by the Central Bank and take the opportunity to fight a speculative battle with the gold policy to obtain huge profits. Bei Zuyi and others are suspected of deliberately泄　this secret. (2) The Central Bank designated five firms, including Tongfengyu, to be responsible for selling gold. The daily gold price was determined based on the reports of the five firms and the Central Bank's phone calls. The designation of the five firms was arbitrarily decided by Bei Zuyi, Lin Fengbao, and Yang Anren without any standards. Moreover, these five firms were all introduced by Zhan Yunsheng, which obviously allowed Zhan Liansheng to control and manipulate them. It is not an exaggeration to call it collusion between officials and merchants. (3) The Central Bank secretly sold gold bars, distributing them to the five firms for free disposal. This secret sale strategy was not decided by the government and should be a method determined arbitrarily by Bei, Lin, and Yang. (4) Reviewing the number of gold bars sold by the five gold distribution firms, there are dozens of entries listing the number of gold purchased by Central Bank personnel, totaling over a hundred bars. Even Wang Songtao, who managed the gold勯cun, also purchased gold bars. Bei Zuyi did not impose any restrictions, which is suspected of allowing his subordinates to engage in gold speculation and trading. (5) Since the beginning of January this year, as gold prices gradually rose and the gold policy could no longer be supported, Bei Zuyi and others did not　report the facts and formulate better methods, but delayed until February 10 to suddenly announce the suspension of gold distribution, causing gold prices to skyrocket and become impossible to拾, and shifting the responsibility for the suspension, which is extremely illegal. Based on the above facts, a proposal for impeachment was made, requesting that Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, the director of the Business Bureau, Yang Anren, the deputy director, and Wang Songtao, the assistant manager, be all transferred to the disciplinary committee. The case was established after review by members Jin Yu　, Wang Zixian, and Yu Shude and was presented to the National Government by the Control Yuan for delivery to the committee.

Reasons

The parts of the case involving the impeached persons Lin Fengbao and Yang Jiaren have been approved by the Shanghai District Court, according to a letter from the Secretariat of this committee. Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren have been transferred to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters by the Garrison Headquarters due to a corruption case, and are currently under trial. The facts of their prosecution are roughly the same as the facts recorded in the impeachment case, so the disciplinary proceedings cannot be initiated according to law. The parts of the case involving the impeached persons Bei Zuyi and Wang Songtao are investigated separately as follows: (the following text turns to page two)

### News Bureau Cables Security Authorities in Various Locations to Ensure the Safety of Journalists; Director Dong Answers Questions at a Reception

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] Recently, there have been several arrests of news professionals in various locations. At a press conference held by the News Bureau on the 4th, someone asked Dong Xian Guang what the News Bureau's opinion was on this matter. Dong replied that two days prior, the News Bureau had already telegraphed security and police authorities in various locations, requesting that they ensure the freedom and safety of journalists. After the student unrest subsides, they will further consult with local authorities.

[Central News Agency Nanjing 4th Dispatch] The News Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 4th, personally presided over by Director Dong Xian Guang. The following is a record of Director Dong's answers to various questions from reporters:

Question: It is widely rumored that the government attaches particular importance to preventing the strikes and class boycotts of June 2nd. Is it truly necessary to take preventative measures against the aforementioned movements?

Answer: According to information obtained by the government in advance from various sources, a well-organized strike and class boycott demonstration with malicious intent was planned to be launched in major cities across the country on June 2nd. The aim was to create disturbances, thereby developing into bloody riots. Therefore, the government had to take emergency preventative measures.

Students Were Alert in Time, June 2nd Passed Safely

The crisis was averted mainly due to three factors: (1) Students across the country were able to understand the greater good and were alert in time; (2) School authorities, as well as the Political Consultative Council, the Legislative Yuan, and other public opinion organs, mediated and persuaded, achieving significant success in averting the situation; (3) Local authorities took emergency actions, arresting Communist Party members and others who participated in the activities either automatically or blindly.

Question: It is said that the June 2nd demonstration plan was orchestrated behind the scenes by the Communist Party. What is Director Dong's opinion on this?

Answer: Communist Party conspiracies are most easily carried out in places where thoughts are mixed and economic difficulties exist. All countries that have suffered long-term war have this common experience. Therefore, the recent student movement was quickly exploited by the Communist Party as a tool to disrupt public order and endanger the government. You must all remember that June 2nd was the day the Chinese Communist Party launched the so-called "Anti-Civil War Movement" in Yan'an last year.

Question: Has the policy of arresting so-called Communist Party members by local authorities been approved by the Executive Yuan in advance? Will the arrested students and journalists be tried publicly? Does the government agree to send the arrested Communist Party members back to the Communist-controlled areas?

Answer: After the peace talks broke down, the government explicitly ordered all Communist Party personnel to return to the Communist-controlled areas before May 5th. Therefore, local authorities do not need to seek further instructions from the Executive Yuan before arresting Communist Party members. Students and journalists arrested in cities under martial law will be interrogated by the local military authorities.

Question: How many students nationwide have been arrested due to activities in recent weeks? How many journalists or newspaper editors have been arrested?

Answer: Arrests have occurred in several cities due to recent student demonstrations. Some have been detained after arrest, while others have been released quickly. Therefore, there are no accurate figures to report. Approximately eighty Communist Party members and those acting in concert with the Communist Party have been arrested in Shanghai, including students and journalists. More than twenty students were detained in Hankou and have since been released after interrogation.

Question: How many students have died in the recent disturbances, and where did they die? Please inform us.

Answer: Other than the three students in Hankou, there have been no deaths in other locations.

Question: Can you list the names of Chinese cities that have been under martial law since last week?

Answer: Shanghai has not been declared to be no longer under martial law since the State Council declared martial law in November of the 34th year of the Republic. According to Article 3 of the Martial Law Act, the highest military commander in a city or region close to a war zone may declare martial law at any time when public security is threatened. The recent declarations of martial law in Peiping and Tianjin are examples of this. Although Communist Party personnel withdrew from Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places on April 5th, their underground operatives did not withdraw at the same time and have recently been plotting riots in various places. The government has obtained evidence, so it must conduct searches and detentions in order to send them to the Communist-controlled areas.

US Surplus Materials Expected to be Shipped Continuously

Question: What is the current status of the shipment of US surplus materials to China?

Answer: To date, the Chinese government has received surplus materials worth approximately US$20 million, mainly trucks. The transfer of US surplus materials to China is based on the contract signed by former President Song and the US in August of the 35th year of the Republic. The US government agreed to ship materials worth over US$500 million to the Chinese government within 20 months from the date of signing the contract. However, due to the lack of transportation, the US has only delivered a small portion of the total amount to date. The Foreign Liquidation Commission, which is responsible for this matter on the US side, will begin to conclude in July of this year. Therefore, the Chinese government is extremely hopeful that the transferred materials will be shipped continuously. Our Materials Supply Bureau has recently signed contracts with several US shipping companies to transport materials from Guam, Okinawa, and the Mariana Islands to China. Also, these materials stored on the various islands are currently under joint custody by China and the United States.

Question: The Political Consultative Council passed many peace proposals at its recent general assembly. Is the government optimistic about the prospects of this peace movement?

Answer: President Chiang and President Zhang have mentioned the government's desire for peace several times in the past week. However, peace is a two-way street and cannot be achieved by one side alone. At the moment, peace or lack thereof depends entirely on the Chinese Communist Party. While the Political Consultative Council was launching the peace movement, the Communist Party was launching wars in various places. This can be considered the Communist Party's response to the peace movement.

Question: On June 2nd, there was an anti-riot, anti-strike march by the student union in Peking. According to the temporary measures for maintaining social order, marches of more than ten people should be stopped. However, the student union's march was not stopped. How does the government explain this?

Answer: To the best of my knowledge, a small number of people engaged in small group propaganda on that day. There was no march or demonstration, so the government did not stop it.

Question: It is reported that Tianjin has resumed news censorship. Was this under the order of the News Bureau?

Answer: The News Bureau has not issued any orders, nor has the News Bureau received any official reports regarding this matter.

Question: The Political Consultative Council resolved at its recent general assembly to requisition deposits held abroad by Chinese citizens. Has the government drafted any measures for requisitioning?

Answer: It is still under study by the competent authorities.

[Associated Press Nanjing 4th Dispatch] According to a statement released today by the Compensation Committee here, the total direct war losses of the Chinese government and private individuals amount to more than US$31 billion. The largest losses were in buildings, farm implements, and private property, totaling US$21.033 billion. These figures are believed to include war damage reports submitted to local governments by various disaster areas after the end of the war. The total losses of industrial and commercial buildings are US$4.053 billion, including Chinese factories removed by the Japanese army in the occupied areas, such as university factories in Shanghai. The committee also stated that losses in agricultural and forestry protection amounted to US$3.976 billion. Losses to public institutions such as hospitals and universities reached US$1.157 billion.

### US Advocates Early Conclusion of Siamese Treaty with Japan; Preparatory Meeting Expected in Washington

[Reuters Washington 3rd Dispatch] Government authorities stated today that if a preparatory meeting for the treaty with Japan is convened, it will likely be held in Washington. San Francisco and Honolulu have also been mentioned as possible locations in the past. While US officials advocate an early conclusion of the treaty with Japan, they do not believe it will be signed before the end of next year. Some individuals feel that the movement to draft a treaty with Japan as soon as possible has spread among the Allied nations, given the United Kingdom's move to convene a meeting of its dominions to discuss policy on the treaty with Japan.

[Associated Press Tokyo 4th Dispatch] According to reporters who have learned from the highest levels here, hopes are now increasing daily that an Allied conference on Japan will be convened before the end of this year and that a treaty will be signed in early 1948. Due to recent developments in the United States, powerful organs of public opinion tend to support MacArthur's position, advocating that a treaty be concluded with Japan and followed by the withdrawal of Allied occupation forces. This is considered the most encouraging. Hoover's suggestion, that a treaty be concluded with Japan immediately regardless of the situation in Europe, is particularly welcome here and is considered to accurately reflect the actual situation in the Far East. According to the information obtained by reporters, there are no major difficulties in the treaty with Japan, as there are actually no particularly complex problems that have not yet been resolved. The Potsdam Declaration has stipulated Japan's post-war borders, restricting it to the Japanese mainland, namely Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, Kyushu, and possibly including the adjacent small islands. This declaration itself includes broad provisions that should be included in the treaty in the future. If its spirit and provisions are followed, the work of the treaty-makers will be very easy in terms of fundamental issues. Substantively, people here expect the Soviet Union to continue to retain jurisdiction over the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin, which were allowed to be ceded to the Soviet Union under the Yalta Agreement. The United States will retain control of the Ryukyu Islands (including Okinawa), which will be the main American base in the Far Western Pacific in the future. Although the British Commonwealth Republic, including Australia, differs greatly from the United States in its views on the terms, it is believed that it is extremely hopeful that a treaty with Japan can be concluded as soon as possible. It is expected that the attitude of the British city-states will be formally decided at the upcoming Canberra conference, and there will be an indication of this. Furthermore, people here solemnly point out that the United States has collected compensation figures from China, the Soviet Union, and other Allied nations, estimating its value at US$40 billion, including Japanese property in Northeast China (including Taiwan) taken by the Soviet Union. People here believe that there is still a great hope that the Peace Conference will be held in East China, because the authorized compensation delegations of the main Allied nations have already arrived here, and at the same time, there are experienced personnel and sufficient files to refer to for every conceivable question.

[Another dispatch] The new Japanese Minister of Finance, Takeda, told our reporter: "It is very important for Japan to convene a peace conference and conclude a treaty quickly. Japan hopes that the Peace Conference can be convened as soon as possible, as the absence of a treaty is the main obstacle to Japan's reconstruction. The Japanese are also willing to pay the compensation that is due, but hope that the Allied nations can strive to maintain enterprises that maintain the most basic level of survival."

Wang Zhengting's Remarks

### Allied Nations Should Supervise Japan Long-Term Until Aggressive Intentions are Eliminated

[This City News] Mr. Wang Zhengting, a famous figure in our country's diplomacy, expressed his feelings yesterday regarding Japan's repeated display of its ambition towards Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands, strongly advocating that the Allied nations should supervise Japan long-term until the Japanese people's aggressive intentions are completely eliminated. He stated: Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. Therefore, Japan's demands are extremely unreasonable. Regardless of whether its demands can be realized, our country must pay close attention to its development and make full preparations. He believes that the most powerful guarantee of our country's safety is to strive for self-improvement. It is most regrettable that our country's domestic situation is chaotic and unstable, resulting in missed opportunities.

Dong Wenqi Talks About Water Conservancy in the Northeast

[Our Newspaper News] Dong Wenqi took the 11:00 PM express train to Peking yesterday (the 4th) to attend the National Water Conservancy Conference and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in about a week, before going to the Northeast. According to Mr. Dong's statement to reporters, there are two urgent tasks regarding water conservancy in the Northeast: one is the Rao Yang River project. In the hands of the Japanese, it has been completed seven-tenths of the way. However, there has been much damage in the past two years. Therefore, disaster prevention is a concern. Last year, when the flood occurred, the losses in the eight counties along the river exceeded 5 billion national currency units. Therefore, this project must be completed this year. During this trip to Peking, I will consult with the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the Executive Yuan on everything, and obtain financial and material assistance. The second is the East Liao River water conservancy project, which was completed eight-tenths of the way during the puppet Manchukuo era. The embankment has been built. After this project is fully developed, it will turn 300,000 acres of wasteland into fertile land, with an annual production of 67,000 tons of rice and 36,000 tons of soybeans. This time, I will take advantage of the National Water Conservancy Conference to present it together, arousing the attention of the people of the country. In addition, the area of the major river basins in the Northeast accounts for more than 90% of the total area of the Northeast, which can be called a water-rich region. During the puppet Manchukuo era, the Japanese had a long-term water conservancy construction plan. North Manchuria was centered on the Songhua River system, and South Manchuria was centered on the Liao River system. The survey work began in 1936, and a ten-year plan was established in 1937, covering everything from flood prevention, afforestation, soil conservation, water storage, flood control, irrigation, and hydropower generation. It was grand and detailed, but it was not fully completed due to the War of Resistance and the Pacific War. In terms of hydropower generation, the Japanese planned to establish 45 power stations in the Northeast, generating a total of 5.85 million kilowatts. Three have been completed, and four are still under construction. During this trip to Peking to attend the conference, I have drafted a proposal for the development of the entire Northeast water conservancy enterprise.

In addition, Peng Jiqun, chairman of Nenjiang Province, also took the same train to Peking with Dong Wenqi yesterday to attend the National Water Conservancy Conference.

### Japanese Ship Sneaks into Fujian Waters; Seized in Weitou Ao; Captain and Crew Detained

[Our Newspaper Fuzhou 4th Dispatch] The Xiamen Customs previously seized a Japanese merchant ship, the Daishin Maru, in the waters of Weitou Ao in Yinggang. In addition to handling the cargo according to regulations, the passengers on board, two Fujianese and Taiwanese, were released after being questioned by the Customs. The remaining ship's captain, Shigeharu Shibata, and ten crew members were detained and sent by the Customs to the Xiamen City Government for disposal. Before the Allied nations and Japan have signed a peace treaty, the Executive Yuan previously explained that ships from countries that have not signed a reciprocal treaty are not allowed to sail to our commercial ports. The fact that a Japanese ship has sneaked into our territorial waters is a violation of the law. The Xiamen City Government has telegraphed the province to request instructions.

### National Provincial Bank Annual Meeting Concludes; Decision to Petition the Ministry of Finance to State Difficulties; Request Consideration of Revising Provincial Bank Regulations

Editorial

### The Death Knell of Democratic Hungary

It is worth our attention to the recent developments in Europe. The nature of these events is quite serious and may affect the overall global situation. Although we are still in East Asia, because the world is indivisible, we cannot but pay close attention to these developments in Europe: (1) News from Yugoslavia states that it is about to form a Balkan Federation, including Albania, and Macedonia in the back of Greece is also under the control of Yugoslavia, joining the federation under the name of autonomous states. At the same time, according to a telegram from the capital of Yugoslavia, in addition to Bulgarian Prime Minister Ye Liye who has already arrived, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is also reported to have arrived in the capital of Yugoslavia. Furthermore, Marshal Tito issued a statement at this time, believing that the free Balkan people must unite and become a strong whole, and also pointed out that the situation in Greece is full of crises due to the inability to unite. For the sake of joint security, the Balkan Slavs must join hands. (2) The Soviet Union's attitude towards Finland has become stronger, and a new situation is brewing in Finland. (3) A coup d'état occurred in Hungary, and the Hungarian Prime Minister was forced to step down, resulting in a pro-Soviet regime in Hungary. (4) The United States stopped lending to Hungary. (5) US Secretary of State Marshall declared: We should continue to assist Italy, hoping that the new government led by Gasperi will succeed in everything, and the American people have a deep and good interest in the welfare of Italy. From the development of these events, it is not difficult for us to imagine how "power politics" is unfolding in Europe. This situation will undoubtedly continue to develop in Europe, affecting the overall global peace.

What do these events signify? Needless to say, the sharpening of the struggle between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The organization of the Balkan Federation is naturally the result of the United States' increased aid to Greece. This is already very clear in Marshal Tito's speech. However, the so-called Balkan Federation here is not an automatic combination of the Balkan people, but is generated under the control of Yugoslavia. Its purpose is obviously to attempt to exert pressure on Greece and other countries with the strength of the "entire Balkans," so that the entire Balkans can become a Soviet vassal. This pressure is also applied to Finland, and the coup in Hungary has particularly prominent characteristics. Undoubtedly, the occurrence of all these events is clearly indicating that the Soviet Union is attempting to consolidate its power in Eastern Europe, wanting to establish a solid "Iron Curtain" from Finland to Yugoslavia. Behind this Iron Curtain, the Soviet Union absolutely does not allow the existence of any regime that is unfavorable to the Soviet Union. The purpose of organizing the Balkan Federation is this: the purpose of the coup in Hungary is also this.

We do not feel that the coup that occurred in Hungary this time was sudden: what really surprised us was that the Hungarian coup was launched because the Soviet side, based on the statement of the Secretary-General of the Smallholders Party, announced that former Prime Minister Nagy had committed treason. This Secretary-General is now deeply imprisoned by the Soviet side. The Soviet announcement believes that Prime Minister Nagy is guilty of desiring Hungarian democracy, so the Hungarian Prime Minister, who was on vacation in Switzerland, had to resign. With the support of the Soviet side, Qian, the former Army Chief of Staff, Dennis, took office as Prime Minister. The Smallholders Party, as the name suggests, has strong petty-bourgeois connotations: this cannot be harmoniously integrated with political groups that advocate the dictatorship of the proletariat. It was generally expected that a coup would occur in Hungary. But what surprised the world this time was that the Soviet side was always the open director of this coup. The Dennis government, unintentionally, is completely under the control of the Communist Party; and the Communist Party in Hungary, at least so far, is not a majority party. This is why we see that the first measure of the new Hungarian regime is to prepare for elections, so that this new regime, which was seized several times, can have a reasonable legal basis. Undoubtedly, if the election is completed, the pro-Soviet political group will inevitably gain an absolute advantage. This is why the result of the Hungarian coup is the death of Hungary's nascent democracy. For the death of this nascent democracy, the democratic countries of Western Europe cannot but express heartfelt concern. If the United Kingdom and the United States jointly protest to the Soviet Union and interfere in the Hungarian situation, this would be a very natural thing.

According to a Reuters dispatch, the Hungarian political crisis was caused by the failure of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The United States and the Soviet Union are gradually estranged from each other, so they are both trying their best to consolidate their positions in Eastern and Western Europe before autumn. Hungary has now become the center of political means. The Soviet Union's actions are aimed at reducing the Hungarian Smallholders Party, which currently holds a majority, to put the Communist Party in an advantageous position. To deal with the Hungarian coup, the United States has no choice but to terminate loans to Hungary and frequently send overtures to Italy, which has now become a pivotal player in the European situation. It is in this sense that we see Secretary of State Marshall's friendly expression towards Italy. How the European situation will unfold in the future is a measure of the strength of the US and Soviet forces. The situations that appear in other parts of the world are closely related to the development of this European situation.

### Pei Tsu-yi Reprimanded: Full Text of the Decision of the Disciplinary Committee for Political Affairs Officials (Continued from the First Edition)

(1) Regarding the part about Pei Tsu-yi: (1) Disclosing the bottom line of the Central Bank's gold reserves. The statement of defense claimed that the bottom line of the gold reserves, the Central Bank colleagues always absolutely, kept secret, the entire equipment of the Central Mint in Shanghai was destroyed, and had not been rebuilt for a long time, so it was compelled to choose reliable gold shops and silver shops to melt and cast separately, until February 6 of this year, the factory sent a letter stating that the equipment was completed, and could cast 1,000 taels of gold bars every day, which was followed. As for the hands of entrusting gold shops and silver shops to melt gold ingots, it was not entirely handled by Tongfengyu alone, but was divided into two groups, one was Taikangrun, which issued a receipt from the shop, and went to the Central Bank to receive gold ingots, recast them into bars, and sent them to the Central Bank for storage without going through Tongfengyu's hands, one was Tongfengyu, which issued a receipt from the shop to receive them. The distribution of Dafengheng, Hongfengyong, Shengyuanshui, Jiuchengyong, Yangqinghe, Yufayong, Xianghe and other seven gold shops for melting was a nature of sub-entrustment. Tongfengyu was responsible for the total responsibility to the Central Bank for the weight and fineness, so it was issued by its general distribution. Tongfengyu had been buying and selling gold for the Central Bank in Maqian for a long time, with a good reputation. The seven gold shops and silver shops melted gold bars and were included in the Tongfengyu group, and it was responsible for the total responsibility to obtain a fully reliable guarantee to avoid accidents, and there was no selfishness involved. All the gold allocated by the Central Bank was aimed at members of the Silver Shop Industry Rectification Committee and the Gold Industry Association, and the chairman of the Rectification Committee and the directors and representatives of the Association handled the application procedures for buying, without going through Zhan Liansheng's hands. Squabbles were aimed at five gold and silver shops, and the delivery was divided into two groups. Tongfengyu and other four shops were in one group, and Tongfengyu added a certificate. Taikangrun was another group, and the shop was responsible for issuing receipts. All the transactions handled by the shop did not go through Zhan Liansheng's hands. The intention of the defense of the accused person was that the melting of gold ingots and the secret sale of gold were handled by Tongfengyu and Taikangrun in two groups, and they would not be able to know the bottom line of the Central Bank's gold reserves. However, the investigation revealed that only one shop, Tailrun, was in the two groups mentioned by the accused person, and Tongfengyu's group included seven shops, including Yifengheng, for melting gold ingots, and four shops, including Dafengheng, for secretly selling gold. Moreover, the Central Bank designated five shops for lending gold. In addition to Tongyingyu, which was opened by Zhan Liansheng, the other four shops were all introduced by Zhan Yunsheng. Therefore, the original impeachment case stated that Tongliyu knew the total amount of gold melted by the Central Bank, and that the gold allocated to the five shops could only be received after Zhan Yunsheng stamped it. Therefore, it was appropriate to say that there were some disturbances. According to the investigation report of Supervisory Committee member He Hanwen and others, from January 4 to February 15 when the sale was suspended, the Central Bank entrusted five shops to distribute 79,440 gold bars. Tongfengyu accounted for the largest number, exceeding half. Tongfengyu suddenly purchased a large number of gold bars before the government announced the suspension of distribution, and the market price soared. If Tongfengyu did not know the gold reserves, how could it be like this? Even if the accused person did not intentionally disclose the secrets of the Central Bank's gold reserves, he failed to perform his duties well, and it was difficult to shirk the blame for dereliction of duty. (2) The five shops designated by the Central Bank to distribute gold were arbitrarily decided to manipulate, and officials and merchants colluded. Two methods of explicit distribution and secret sale were adopted. Explicit distribution was aimed at the Gold Industry and Silver Shop Industry Associations, and secret sale was aimed at the five designated shops. The gold explicitly distributed was not the responsibility of the five shops, and although the gold secretly sold was directly traded with the Central Bank by the five shops via telephone, whether it could be distributed and the amount of distribution were entirely determined by the Central Bank according to the situation, and were not manipulated by the five shops. The Central Bank sold gold at 10:00 am every day, and used the market quotations reported by gold shops or foreign exchange brokers in Dianqing at 9:00 am on the same day as a reference for determining the distribution price. Before the time, within a few seconds, the gold shops could not obtain contact to try to deceive. As for the secret sale of gold, the five shops contacted the Central Bank separately via telephone, and each transaction was completed. The price of each transaction was entirely determined by the Central Bank based on the market reports obtained at that time. When the prices reported by the five shops were deemed inappropriate, they were not adopted or distributed. The Central Bank took the initiative in determining the gold price every day or even every moment, and did not completely rely on the telephone reports of the five shops. Regarding the selection of Zhan Yunsheng, the chairman of the Gold Industry Association, to serve as the leader, it was because Zhan Liansheng was a legitimate leader in the gold industry, and had a long-term relationship with the Central Bank before the war. Xu Fusun, the chairman of the Gold Exchange, who was the most qualified in the gold industry before the war, also believed that he was reliable. In addition, the Central Bank chose gold shops in order to be practical, reliable and impartial. It should be recommended by the chairman Zhan Liansheng in the members of the association. In order to maintain secrecy, the number of shops handling the business could not be too many. The five shops decided were those who had more gold transactions with the Central Bank before the war, had a longer history, and had a good reputation. The Central Bank chose carefully and was not arbitrarily designated without standards. There was no intention of letting Zhan Liansheng monopolize the operation, and there was no collusion between officials and merchants. The investigation revealed that the accused person's defense on this point was not without considerable reason. However, Tongfengyu, one of the five shops designated by the Central Bank, had not yet obtained a business license (see the record of the interview with Zhan Yunsheng by Supervisory Committee member He Hanwen), and then designated it to distribute gold, and the blame for dereliction of duty could not be shirked. (3) Unauthorizedly determining the secret sale method, and distributing gold bars to the five shops to dispose of freely. According to the defense, the Central Bank's explicit sale of gold was only once a day, and it still failed to take the initiative in controlling the market. In order to comply with the government's policy, referring to the entire market situation, and based on the actual supply and demand, in order to stabilize the gold price at any time, in addition to the explicit distribution, the five designated gold shops and silver shops were used to sell a small number of 20 to 30 bars in installments to meet the needs of the industry and customers. If the market price rises and the needs of the industry and customers increase, the number of sales will also increase to achieve the effect of controlling the market and stabilizing the market price. This distribution method was entrusted to the five shops by the Central Bank at the same time, and the secret was absolutely kept in advance to avoid being used by speculators. This was a necessary promotion for the Central Bank to actively and secretly sell gold to control the market. The shops were acting as agents for customers, and each shop negotiated with the Central Bank to buy and transfer to meet the needs of the industry and customers according to their needs. They were not able to freely dispose of and manipulate the market after purchasing in bulk from the Central Bank. At the beginning of the Central Bank's gold trading, it had been carefully studied, and it was believed that it was necessary to adopt both methods to deal with the market situation and respond accordingly. All distribution situations since March of the Republic of China were reported in writing to President Song of the Executive Yuan every day. The distribution of gold was handled in accordance with the government's intentions, and there was no unauthorized decision. The original impeachment stated that the sudden suspension of distribution on the morning of February 10 did not conform to the facts at the time. The investigation revealed that the accused person's measures to restrict the distribution of gold were necessary in light of the situation, and should not be held responsible for punishment. (4) Allowing subordinates to speculate and trade gold without restraint. According to the defense, in the past, gold was freely traded, and it was not illegal for employees of the national bank to purchase gold from gold shops with their own funds. However, in order to restrain colleagues from avoiding criticism, the person in charge issued a notice to colleagues at the beginning of his tenure in March of the Republic of China, severely warning them of such situations. On May 27, an order was issued to colleagues not to engage in other businesses or handle funds for others, and especially not to use the bank's telephones and other tools to contact the above matters during office hours. If there was any violation, once verified, they would be immediately dismissed, and their direct supervisors should also supervise them at all times. If they knew but did not report, they would all be subject to dismissal. In May of last year, the person in charge found that a consultant's secretary had used the bank's telephone to engage in buying and selling activities, and immediately ordered him to leave the bank. All of the above items are recorded in the bank's files. The investigation revealed that the accused person's defense on this point was not without reason, and that there was no evidence that he had allowed subordinates to speculate and trade gold, and it could be dismissed. (5) Announcing the suspension of gold distribution and shirking responsibility. The defense briefly stated that in late January of this year, there were various speculations in the community about foreign exchange adjustments, and the situation was unstable. The amount of idle funds in the market increased day by day, and the demand for gold increased. The market price rose sharply, and it was difficult to control it purely by the distribution of the national bank. Therefore, he immediately asked President Song for instructions. President Song then convened foreign consultants to discuss and decided to restrict and reduce the amount of sales as appropriate. Therefore, the secret sale was temporarily suspended from February 4, and the actual sales needs of the silver shop industry were still distributed as usual. On the 8th, the rising trend was still severe. On the evening of the same day, the person in charge went to Beijing to ask for instructions on the policy. President Song convened relevant personnel twice to discuss together, and decided to only distribute to silver shops. Therefore, from February 10, it was announced that no distribution would be given to gold shops, but explicit distribution would continue for the silver shop industry. It was not announced to be completely suspended until the Central Government promulgated the emergency economic measures plan on February 16. Zuyi belonged to Zungongling for handling, and did not dare to shirk responsibility. The original impeachment stated that the sudden suspension of distribution on the morning of February 10 did not conform to the facts at the time. The investigation revealed that the accused person's measures to restrict the distribution of gold were necessary in light of the circumstances, and should not be held responsible for punishment.

(2) Regarding Wang Songtao: The investigation revealed that the accused person Wang Songtao, in the position of Assistant Manager of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank and Director of the Treasury Department, was in a very important position, and should abide by laws and regulations and serve loyally. However, after repeated warnings from the President of the Bank, he still used his position to purchase gold bars, which was suspected of taking advantage of his position to speculate and profit. According to the defense, he introduced his relative Ma Hongxiang to accompany the staff of Tongfengyu Gold Shop to the gold shop to buy. His name was listed as a buyer in the accounts of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, and he tried to shirk responsibility, which was difficult to believe. The accused person should be subject to the punishment law.

In summary, the accused person Pei Tsu-yi has the circumstances of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Servant Disciplinary Law, and Wang Songtao has the circumstances of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Member Pei Tsu-yi is resolved according to Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 5 and Article 8 of the same law, and Wang Songtao is resolved according to Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Article 4 of the same law as the main text. (End)

### Britain Transfers Power to India: Realization Expected in August of this Year: Indian Leaders Call on the People to Live in Peace

[This newspaper report] London, broadcast on the 4th: Governor-General Mountbatten announced in New Delhi today that Britain will hand over power to the two autonomous governments of India and Pakistan on August 15. August 15 is the day the Japanese army surrendered. Mountbatten pointed out that the purpose of this decision to divide India and Pakistan is to accelerate the return of power to the Indians. Mountbatten is scheduled to leave India and return to Britain in early August.

[This newspaper report] London, broadcast on the 4th: Mountbatten assured the people of India today that Britain will not retain bases in India after India achieves independence under the British plan.

[This newspaper report] London, broadcast on the 4th: Mountbatten met with the Ministers of the Interim Cabinet of India today and declared afterwards: "To maintain peace during the transition period, the entire Indian armed forces will be used when necessary." Mountbatten said that this was a "secret" of the Indian Cabinet, but he also said that he was confident that the Indian problem could be resolved peacefully and there would be no bloodshed. 60,000 soldiers and police have been deployed to prevent conflicts between India and Pakistan.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 4th] Governor-General Mountbatten hosted hundreds of Indian and foreign reporters here today and stated that Britain would leave India when asked to withdraw from India. He said that the transfer of power in India, which was scheduled to be completed in June 1948, may be completed this year. Britain will leave India when asked to withdraw from India. We may have completely withdrawn from India by the end of this year, or a part of us may have to stay longer. The principle of the British in India is to be useful to India. If it is no longer useful and they are asked to withdraw, they should withdraw. I have tried my best to have the plan of the British Cabinet Mission accepted by the Indian leaders. This is a feasible plan, but it depends on mutual goodwill and cooperation to implement it. The plan accepted this time may not be the best solution, but in any case, the Indians should decide the future of their country themselves. I have worked closely with the Indian leaders at every stage of the development of this plan, so the Indian leaders were not surprised when this plan was put forward. We admit that this plan is not perfect. If there were a perfect solution, the Indian leaders would have been able to solve it themselves long ago. What I can do is to try my best to reconcile the opposing opinions of the two factions and make one party understand how to make its opinions meet the other party. The Governor-General continued, the Boundary Committee will include representatives of local ethnic groups, and no British official will force any party to accept its opinions, because this is the country of the Indians, and the Indians should decide everything themselves. We are deeply grateful for the firm expression of the responsible leaders in India that no matter what solution is finally adopted, it will be used in a peaceful and bloodless way. Every member of my cabinet has expressed the hope to use the military force in India to prevent bloodshed and violence. The Governor-General continued, setting up a solution for the status of autonomous territories. I have asked the Prime Minister to find a way to complete this legislation within two months, and he has indicated his consent. The Governor-General added that some people may think that Britain does not have the sincerity to withdraw from India, and only uses the status of autonomous territories as bait. It is important to know that if this plan is not a good solution, the Indian leaders would not have accepted it.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] The two major Indian leaders, Nehru and Jinnah, broadcast to the Indian people tonight, announcing their acceptance of the British government's plan to transfer power to India, and called for peace and order. Nehru's broadcast stated that we should forget everything in the past. Although I accepted this plan with a not very pleasant mood, I feel that our decision this time is a correct decision. Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim League, continued to speak, emphasizing the importance of transferring power in a peaceful manner, and expressing the hope that India would maintain peace and harmony. Singh, the Minister of Defense of the Sikh Leader Provisional Government, spoke after Jinnah, saying that the British government's plan has opened up a new path beyond conflicting demands, and it is still a valuable plan.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 3rd] Muslim League leader Jinnah delivered a broadcast speech at a radio station here today, ordering Muslim League personnel in the Northwest Frontier Province to immediately stop the riots and stop the disobedience movement that has been resisting the government of the Northwest Frontier Province for the past three months.

### US Perceptions of the Indian Political Situation: Hoping to Maintain a State of Peace

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] State Department officials did not express any other opinions on the British announcement of the plan to transfer power to India, except to express the hope that a state of peace could be maintained during the transition period. But they reiterated the opinions previously expressed by the State Department, stating the United States' friendship with India and the US government's interest in a satisfactory solution to the Indian political situation. Informally, there is a feeling of disappointment about the division of India, but they pointed out that the British plan does not exclude the possibility of reorganizing a unified Indian government in the future, so they hope that negotiations aimed at unification can still be held in the future. Congressman Saylor, the spokesperson for the American Indians, told our agency that from the economic geography and history of India, I do not believe that India, which is split into Pakistan and Hindustan, can develop smoothly. Moreover, Pakistan is separated from east and west, and Jinnah's request to set up a corridor between the east and west will make the situation even more chaotic. I also believe that when the Sikhs refuse to allow Muslims to touch Amritsar, the Sikh holy city in the province of Punjab, the Sikhs will also put forward the demand for Sikhistan.

[United Press, Manila, 4th] The new US Ambassador to India, Grande, left here by boat today to take up his post. Grande did not express his opinion on the British announced plan for Indian independence, only saying that Americans sympathize with the Indian problem and hope for an early solution.

### Truman Agrees to Convene: Western Hemisphere Defense Conference: Argentina Will Also Participate

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The White House recently announced that President Truman is now willing to renegotiate with other American countries on the Western Hemisphere Defense Conference. After returning to China to report on his duties, the Argentine Ambassador recently returned to his post here. He reviewed the measures taken by his government with Truman and Marshall, and explained that his country is still fulfilling the tasks of the Pan-American Conference on war and peace. The Argentine Ambassador continued to express that his government has no intention of obstructing negotiations and hopes to establish a mutual assistance agreement. Therefore, Truman also expressed his willingness to consult with various American countries to convene a Western Hemisphere Defense Conference, but he hoped that Argentina would be consistent in its words and deeds before the United States participates in the defense agreement.

### Argentina Clears: Nazi Forces Within Its Borders

[United Press, Argentine Capital, 3rd] The Argentine Foreign Minister recently announced that the nationalization of Nazi property in Argentina has now entered the final stage. For example, the expulsion of Nazi elements is the main measure taken by Argentina to eliminate the Axis forces in order to join the Western Hemisphere Defense Group. It is heard that Vittorio, the son of Mussolini, may be deported.

### US Universal Military Training Issue: Congress to Begin Debate

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] As the United States treads the path to becoming a strong nation through education, it now faces another historically significant choice: whether to adopt the universal military training program recommended by the Presidential Advisory Committee. For the US, this is an unprecedented step, completely different from tradition. As America cautiously moves towards leading the world and fulfilling its leadership responsibilities, this matter will spark another major debate in Congress and society. However, it will be a most difficult problem for Congress to decide. According to the consistent thinking of the American people, their military missions can be undertaken by a small number of professional army, navy, and air force personnel. Although the atomic bomb has greatly changed the general public's thinking about the future of US national defense, the majority of Congressmen still stubbornly hold to their old ideas, believing that supporting universal military training will give voters a bad impression politically, and they will lose votes in the next election. This is the biggest problem. According to several public opinion surveys, one of which indicated that 75% of people favored universal military training as necessary for national security, but the majority of Congressmen expressed disbelief. To date, some Congressmen believe that it is impossible to pass any similar military training bill in the current Congress (which will adjourn on July 30).

### US Senate to Vote Today: Approving Four-Nation Peace Treaty; Vandenberg Condemns Hungarian Communists

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The US Senate will vote tomorrow on the ratification of the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged Congress yesterday in the Senate to take prompt action to ratify the four-nation peace treaties so that the work of European reconstruction could be rapidly launched.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated in an important speech in the Senate today that the Hungarian Communist Party's seizure of power has "provoked a further sense of outrage" and that the United States should ask UN agencies to investigate. Vandenberg also urged immediate ratification of the treaties with Italy and other countries, predicting that the Communist Party's "conspiracy to conquer" Hungary would be followed by "monopolized elections." He also hinted that the United States might take action without waiting long for Soviet cooperation, directly addressing the long-delayed issue of a comprehensive European peace treaty. His strong language reflected his policy alignment with the government towards the Soviet Union over the past few months. Regarding the Hungarian coup, Vandenberg's views also aligned with the State Department, which stated that the Communist Party's "expressed democratic ideals never had this level of ruthlessness." If all this is true, the United States may recognize its absolute duty to submit the entire matter to UN agencies. Hungary "has now become another Soviet satellite." Ratifying rather than rejecting the treaty with Hungary can preserve America's supreme interests. "If the treaty is not ratified, the Soviet Union will have no obstacles to continuing to control Hungary." This will make the country's democrats feel discouraged. Conversely, ratifying the treaty "will at least theoretically restore Hungary's status as a free nation. Then, any violations of that country can be handled by UN agencies."

### International Control of Atomic Issues: US and Soviet Views are Diametrically Opposed; Soviets Insist on Destroying Existing Atomic Bombs

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 3rd] Sources here recently stated that today's meeting of the UN Atomic Energy Commission was nothing less than a game of hide-and-seek between the US and the Soviet Union over the atomic bomb. Soviet representative Gromyko proposed an amendment to the report of the Atomic Energy Commission, stipulating that "international conventions prohibiting all countries from possessing and manufacturing atomic weapons should be completed by a convention establishing an international system for the control of atomic energy, in order to make them effective." This amendment effectively means that existing atomic weapons should be destroyed before the establishment of a control system. On the other hand, the US plan, which is included in the Atomic Energy Commission's report, advocates establishing a control system first, and then destroying existing atomic weapons, so that countries that are ahead in manufacturing atomic weapons are protected from being attacked by other countries during the gap between the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of a control system. The diametrically opposed views of the US and the Soviet Union were very evident at today's meeting. Representatives from Belgium and Australia expressed their willingness to support the US stance. Canadian representative McNaughton asked: What is the meaning of the word "supervision" in the international atomic energy control system? Gromyko immediately replied: The Soviet Union's acceptance of the atomic energy control system depends on the prior destruction of atomic weapons. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet view is definitely not acceptable to the United States.

### Australian Federal Government Passes New Five-Year Defense Plan; Undertakes Defense of British Empire in the Pacific

[United Press, Canberra, 3rd] According to reliable sources, the Australian Cabinet has passed a five-year defense plan, including allocating funds for research into rockets and atomic energy, and has selected the Flinders Ranges as a location for testing rockets. Testing is expected to begin within a few months. According to United Press, Australia's post-war defense plan is roughly as follows: (1) establishing a strong chain of bases in the Pacific; (2) making Australia a defense base for all regions of the South Pacific, and establishing the most powerful naval base in the British defense plan in Sydney.

### US Congress Should Authorize the President to Send Military Missions Abroad; Secretary Marshall Urges Congress to Pass Bill

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] Secretary of State Marshall asked Congress today to grant the President permanent authority to dispatch army and navy missions to foreign countries at their invitation, and said that granting the President this power does not violate the UN Charter. This move, in addition to contributing to the national interests of the United States, is also in line with the American tradition of assisting friendly nations to maintain their independence.

[US Information Service, Washington, 3rd] Secretary of State Marshall told the House Military Affairs Committee today that if Congress immediately adopts legislation to extend the President's wartime powers, giving the President the authority to dispatch army and navy advisory missions to reside abroad, it would be of great benefit to the maintenance and advancement of US rights and interests. Marshall emphasized that such missions could only be dispatched at the request of foreign governments. Before dispatch, the President should carefully consider the matter, ensuring that the mission of the team is limited to an advisory nature. He also pointed out that the number of personnel in these missions should be small, mainly experts, and they should not engage in any intelligence work. According to Article 78 of the UN Charter, relations between member states should be "based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality." However, in a country where domestic order is chaotic and the crisis is deep, this goal seems difficult to achieve. Once a friendly government requests the dispatch of army and navy missions from this country, if the President does not have the authority to dispatch them, it only deprives the President of the ability to strategize. The US government has declared that it will implement its policy of maintaining peace throughout the world, and participate fully in world affairs with the qualifications of a world power. Marshall stated that if Congress does not pass this legislative bill, it will force the US missions currently stationed in Iran and China to withdraw. He expressed his disbelief, saying that "such actions will inevitably harm the interests of the United States." Marshall explained that the US advisory mission stationed in Nanjing was also dispatched under the President's wartime powers and "has absolutely no relationship to that country's internal conflicts. Our policy towards China has always been to assist that country in developing effective army and navy forces, with a limited number of personnel, so that China's financial institutions are not unduly burdened." This bill is exactly the same as the one submitted to the last Congress, and has been passed by the House and favorably reported to the Senate, but the Senate has not taken action before Congress adjourned.

### Greek Authorities Endorse US Troops Stationed in Greece

[This newspaper's report] London, 4th Broadcast: Chairman of the Greek Cabinet's National Defense Committee, Nitzilos, stated that the strength of the Greek army needs to be doubled in order to cope with the overall situation. He expressed his agreement to the suggestion of stationing US troops in Greece to resist foreign aid to guerrillas. This suggestion was reportedly made privately by the government, due to rumors that Communist international brigades are preparing to enter Greece from Albania and Yugoslavia. However, it is generally believed that the United States will not take this step immediately.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 4th] Reports in the Greek press that an international military brigade is concentrated in Split, preparing to enter Greece, have recently been denied by responsible Yugoslav officials.

### Hungarian Smallholders' Party Implements Party Purge

[Reuters, Budapest, 4th] The executive committee of the Hungarian Smallholders' Party (i.e., the Small Landholders' Party), the largest party in Hungary, recently resolved to conduct an investigation of all party members by a 158-member committee in order to eliminate factors that hinder the cooperation and progress of the coalition cabinet. Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, the leader of the Smallholders' Party, resigned last week after being accused by the Soviet Union of participating in a coup plot. The right-wing elements of the Smallholders' Party were accused of plotting a coup in February to restore former Regent Horthy, and many people were arrested and imprisoned.

### US-Soviet Joint Commission Discusses Platform of Provisional Korean Government; Orders Subcommittee to Submit Reconciliation Plan by a Certain Date

[United Press, Seoul, 4th] The US-Soviet Joint Commission recently issued its second joint communiqué, stating that the committee today discussed various documents, including directives and conditions for consulting with Korean political figures regarding the establishment of a provisional government in that country. It also ordered the subcommittee to submit a draft document reconciling the various principles before June 6. The committee also discussed two issues related to the platform of the provisional government that have not yet been fully agreed upon. US Chief Representative Brown did not follow the usual practice of receiving reporters after today's meeting to explain the contents of the communiqué.

[United Press, Seoul, 4th] US Lieutenant General Hodge sent a letter to Soviet General Korotkov, stating that if the Soviet occupation authorities allow US reporters to enter Pyongyang, the location of the Soviet military headquarters, then the US authorities will allow TASS reporters to go to Seoul. The letter was sent on June 3.

### Loutchy Orders South Korean Agencies to Use Provisional Government Name

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 4th] At a time when the US-Soviet Joint Commission talks are making some progress, South Korean military government officials suddenly revealed that General Loutchy and Civil Affairs Director Ahn Jae-hong issued Order No. 141 on May 17, stipulating that the South Korean Legislative Assembly and judicial organs should, from now on, be uniformly styled with the name of the South Korean Provisional Government. Prior to the US-Soviet talks, South Korean national leaders and civilian groups, especially Kim Yu and others from the former Korean Independence Government, intended to request the organization of a provisional government, but this was previously prohibited by the US military government.

### Emperor Hirohito Tours the Country, Claims to Fill His Stomach with Sweet Potatoes

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 4th] Emperor Hirohito left Tokyo this morning to tour the Osaka and Kobe areas for a period of twelve days. This is his first tour since the implementation of the new constitution. According to well-informed sources, MacArthur recently advised the Emperor during a meeting to tour various places again with the Empress. At the same time, Japanese newspapers published interviews with the Emperor and Empress. The Emperor claimed that sweet potatoes are his main food and that he enjoys writing poetry in his spare time. The silkworms raised by the Empress are expected to harvest about 160 kilograms of silk soon. The Empress said: "I have started learning English, but it is difficult. I am reading American fairy tales."

### Holy Land Investigative Group to Depart Next Wednesday

Temporary Headquarters to be Established in Jerusalem

[Agence France-Presse, New York, Lake Success, 3rd] Officials recently announced that the eleven-member UN Investigative Committee on Palestine will fly to Palestine on a special plane on the 11th of this month to conduct on-site investigations. It will establish its headquarters at the YMCA in Jerusalem and welcomes respected local figures to submit their opinions to the committee.

### Security Council Debates Issue of International Police Force

Soviet Attitude Obstructive, Agreement Difficult to Achieve

[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] The UN Security Council is preparing to begin a general debate today on the organization of a world police force. Representatives of the various member states have formed a line against Soviet views. The US representative is scheduled to speak immediately after the meeting and will reportedly firmly support the basic report of the Military Staff Committee, which is drafting a plan for the organization of the world police force. The general opinions of the US, British, French, and Chinese members are consistent, but the Soviet member has expressed objections to more than one-third of the basic principles. According to a spokesperson for UN Deputy Representative Johnson, the international police force is the core of the entire UN security system, and the United States will urge the Security Council to publicly and thoroughly discuss this issue and establish an international army, navy, and air force as soon as possible.

Disarmament Issue Reaches Stalemate

Also, representatives of the five major powers held consultations yesterday to draft working procedures for the Disarmament Committee, but no agreement was reached. They have now virtually abandoned this attempt and notified the UN Secretariat to prepare a report for submission to the Disarmament Committee, explaining why the representatives of the five countries failed to draft these working procedures. The representatives of the five countries will hold a closed meeting on Friday to study this report and are expected to return the issue to the Disarmament Committee. It is reported that one of the major factors in the divergence of opinions among the representatives of the five countries is that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko sought to link the issue of atomic energy control to the tasks of the Disarmament Committee. But so far, the Disarmament Committee has only been ordered to draft recommendations for reducing armaments and military forces. The Soviet side has recently notified the relevant representatives of the UN Atomic Energy Control that they must decide sooner or later on the Soviet request that the Disarmament Committee prohibit atomic weapons.

### City Council Session Extended to Close Today; Rent Standard Proposal; Assembly Decides to Retain; Majority Believes It Should Not Be Set by City Council

[This newspaper's report] The City Council's three plenary sessions held its sixth meeting yesterday morning and its seventh meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss proposals. It was originally scheduled to close yesterday, but because there were so many proposals, yesterday's meeting, although it lasted until 8:40 PM, was still not completed. Therefore, it will continue the session for another day at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and then hold the closing ceremony.

During yesterday's general assembly, the discussion of the rent standard issue was the most heated. The council's Land Administration, Social Affairs Committee decided to retain it.

Councilor Zhu Wende believes that the city council has no power to change the rent standard. He also offered four points of advice to the city government: The previous standards of 180 times and 140 times should be revoked; please forward the housing leasing regulations to the Legislative Yuan for promulgation and implementation in this city; thoroughly investigate and crack down on illegal rents; and please expedite the completion of housing registration. Ma Junshuo believes that the current housing leasing situation is unreasonable and advocates that the housing leasing regulations should be implemented immediately. Establishing rent standards based on these regulations would be reasonable. Zhang Zhihan requested the assembly to decide on two points first: Does the assembly agree to amend the previously set 180 and 140 times standards by the city government? If agreed, will the upper limit be determined by the city council? After resolving these two questions, the rent management method can be discussed.

Should Be Drafted by the City Government

Luo Qinghua stated: The city government reviews and decides on grain prices, yarn prices, and commodity prices without submitting them to the city council. Similarly, the rent standard can also be drafted by the city government. He also expressed two opinions: The city government's previously set rent multipliers should be revoked immediately, and a rent review agency should be established within the city government to formulate provisional rent review regulations. The city government should encourage the construction of new houses and the repair of old houses in various ways. Zhang Nai-zuo said that since the previous standard set by the city government cannot be effectively implemented, the 1800 times proposed by the city government's suggestion and passed by the subcommittee would not be reasonable either. The city council has no power to decide on this case and advocates that it should not be discussed at all. Lu Shi-dao and Li Wenjie both supported Councilor Luo's opinion to retain this case and have the city government draft it with reference to the opinions. Some other councilors also expressed that it should be retained. However, there were also opponents who believed that the interests of the general public should be considered and a reasonable standard should be set.

Mayor Hopes for Support

Later, the Mayor explained that the city government did not intend to push this matter onto the city council. Because it was ordered by the Executive Yuan to consult public opinion on this standard, he requested the assembly to discuss it. But if a standard is not established, it will be impossible to review it. If this case is retained, the city government will not be able to set the standard. He hoped that the city council would support it.

Finally, it was put to a vote and "retention" was passed. The city government will handle the matter itself based on the Provisional City Council's resolution on rent management methods (i.e., regarding the revision of the method for calculating rent in this city, please consider both the income of the owners and the affordability of the citizens).

Regarding the case of "Reiterating the resolution of the first session and second general assembly of this council regarding the allocation of housing rental rights to households by the director in order to avoid causing disturbances," the councilors suggested establishing an enforcement agency. However, according to the mayor, this matter can only be addressed through personal connections, and if an agency is established, there will be no legal basis for enforcement. Therefore, the general assembly resolved: (1) Reiterate the resolution of the first session and second general assembly of this council regarding the director's allocation of housing rental rights to households. (2) Based on the above proposition, please ask the city government and the court to give special protection.

Airports Occupying Civilian Land: Deadline for Completing Procedures

Regarding land administration proposals, the general assembly continued to discuss them yesterday. Except for the issue of rent, which was retained, the rest were passed by the general assembly. They included: (1) "Please ask the city government to negotiate with the relevant central government departments to set a deadline for completing the expropriation and compensation procedures for civilian land occupied by the Longhua, Hongqiao, and Jiangwan airfields that have not completed the procedures. Land that is not being used but is still occupied should be returned to the original owners immediately to ensure the well-being of the people." Resolution: Except for how to use the Longhua Airport cemetery, which will be discussed in a separate case, the rest will be passed according to the review opinions. As for the election of representatives to petition in Beijing, it will be handled in conjunction with other cases. (2) "Please ask the authorities to return all land and buildings owned by the Central Market to restore private ownership." Resolution: The original case is passed. A letter is sent to the city government to verify and return it to the owner.

Enemy and Puppet Office Buildings: Allocated to Various Agencies for Use

(3) "Proposal to allocate enemy and puppet office buildings in this city to various city-owned agencies and organizations for use" passed. (4) "Please ask the city government to quickly designate city-owned public land or expropriate private vacant land to allocate to various district's Old Education District" The principle was approved, and the City Government was requested to order the Land Administration Bureau to quickly survey the location, one to five mu in each district, and consult with the Tomb Fund Committee of the Dedicated School to handle the matter. (5) "Houses in Jiashen Village, Longhua Town, were demolished by the city government's order, please inform the city government to forward the matter to the Logistics Command to exempt them from execution before a reasonable settlement is reached." Resolution: A letter is sent to the city government to forward to the Logistics Department, which should be mindful of the people's livelihood hardships and allow them to continue to reside as before. (6) "Proposal to ask the city government to be responsible for negotiating with the relevant central government departments to quickly clean up and return to the original owners all civilian land, houses, and warehouses in this city that were previously occupied by enemies and puppets and are now received, managed, or used by various central government departments or military agencies stationed in Shanghai." Resolution: A letter is sent to the city government, responsible for negotiating with the relevant management departments, to clean up and return them to the original owners within three months.

### Improve Yarn and Cloth Price Negotiations, Protect Silverware Store Employees; 18 Social Proposals Passed

[This newspaper's report] The city council assembly discussed 18 other social proposals, of which the more important ones that were passed included: (1) "Proposal to submit a solution to the serious grain shortage in this city for discussion." Resolution: Please expedite the implementation of the principle of issuing grain rations per capita on a partial basis, and ensure sufficient grain reserves and the implementation of grain rationing. (2) "Proposal to request the government to improve the yarn and cloth price negotiation method and to lift the transportation and sales controls." Resolution: 1. A telegram is sent to the Executive Yuan requesting the improvement of the yarn and cloth price negotiation method, which should take into account the cost of reproduction. 2. Personnel should lift domestic transportation controls to allow for natural adjustment of supply and demand to stabilize yarn prices in various regions. (3) "Please ask the Spinning and Weaving Management Committee, the Silk Management Committee, and the Bureau of Social Affairs and other agencies to improve the allocation and sales methods." Resolution: Passed. (4) "Please revise the management methods for the silverware industry's collection and manufacturing of gold jewelry in order to alleviate business difficulties and maintain the livelihoods of employees."

### Dentist Accused of Dealing in Gold and Banknotes; Local Procuratorate Summons for Investigation; Chen Zongliu Denies Responsibility

[Report from Our Newspaper] Dentist Chen Zongliu was accused of dealing in black market US dollars and gold, disrupting the financial market. He was interrogated yesterday afternoon at the Local Procuratorate by Prosecutor Li Mingshan. He was ordered to be released on bail with a guarantee from a shareholder and a surety of 50 million yuan pending further investigation. It was reported by the police that the Xinyihe Money Exchange on the fourth floor of 225 Broadway was privately operating in black market US dollars and privately accepting remittances from overseas Chinese in Singapore to Fuzhou and other places, effectively acting as an underground bank. After investigation by the police, it was found that the Xinyihe Money Exchange was mistakenly referred to as Xinhe Shenzhuang. The Zhuang was managed by Yang Zhaoyan, who had left for Fujian the week before, and is now managed by Chen Zongliu. Chen is from Fujian, 42 years old. The business he operates is entrusted by the Yang Ren Yue Gold Shop in Singapore to handle joint remittances with various places in the country. The amount of remittances is very large, with remittance notices and applications for remittances to various places, and remittance telegrams, all complete. Regarding the private operation of black market US dollars, a book of records of black market US dollars, gold pounds, and gold bars was found on the fourth floor, with transaction dates mostly after the promulgation of the economic emergency measures in March of this year. Furthermore, a large number of gold bars, US dollars, British pounds, and other foreign currencies were found in a security box. The Zhuang's private operation of black market US dollars, gold, and other foreign exchange is highly suspected of violating the provisions of the economic emergency measures to crack down on gold speculation and prohibit the circulation of foreign currency.

Yesterday, the police sent the suspects Chen Zongliu, Zhao Zhenya, He Guiting, and the book of black market US dollars and gold bars to the Local Procuratorate. Prosecutor Li Mingshan immediately summoned Chen Jialiu for questioning. According to Chen's statement: Xinyihe Shenzhuang was opened by Yang Zhaoyan, the manager is Yang Renyue, and he is one of the shareholders and does not bear actual responsibility. His profession is a dentist, and his relationship with Yang is as a friend. When he was strictly questioned in court as to why his seal was affixed to every withdrawal, Chen stammered.

### Jiangnan Shipyard Workers Strike Due to Index Dispute

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the publication of the May cost of living index, disputes over the employer's inability to bear the cost have continued. More than 4,000 workers at the Navy Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi went on strike because the shipyard refused to pay according to the index of 23,500 times, but instead calculated at 20,000 times discounted by 30%, and stated that if the workers were dissatisfied, they could leave. This led to a dispute. Two-thirds of the workers went on strike yesterday morning, and one-third were in a state of slow down. The workers also resolved three demands at a meeting at noon: (1) Pay according to 23,500 times. (2) Allow the full reinstatement of the more than 300 workers dismissed on June 1st. (3) No workers may be dismissed without reason in the future.

Cigarette Industry

Workers' wages are paid in two installments. The first half of May was temporarily paid according to the April index of 14,800 times, and the balance would be paid after the second half of the month's index was announced. Currently, the employers are unable to pay the remaining 23,500 times. The industry association sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to state the difficulties of each factory, stating that production of cigarettes is declining due to the upcoming rainy season and is no longer sustainable.

Machine Industry

Because employers cannot afford the index of 23,500 times, many have switched to paying at 14,000 times. Yesterday morning, machine workers in the Third District and Upper District sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to visit Labor Director Zhao Banfu. According to Zhao's extended statement: All issues caused by the index, as Director Wu said, can be resolved in a passive or active way to overcome difficulties together.

### Three Trade Associations Host Reporters to Appeal; Claiming to be Unable to Bear the Burden of the Cost of Living Index

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Machine Industry Association, the 12th District Metal Casting Industry Association, and the 3rd District Electrical Equipment Industry Association jointly hosted reporters at 3:00 PM yesterday. Yan Yaoqiu, Chairman of the Machine Industry Association, reported that the more than 1,000 member factories of the three associations are no longer able to bear the burden of the cost of living index of 23,500 times and will be unable to continue production. They requested the authorities to reduce workers' base wages and asked the Social Affairs Bureau to issue severance pay of three months to workers if the factory cannot be maintained and is closed. This is because the cost of living index has increased, and workers' base wages are unreasonable, so most member factories fear that they do not have enough to pay three months' severance pay to all workers. If base wages are not adjusted, the machinery industry in the city will inevitably collapse. If the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact, and workers will also lose their jobs. In order to maintain industry, increase production, and protect workers' jobs and livelihoods, it is appropriate to quickly find a good solution that takes into account both labor and management. Yesterday, Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau was visited. According to Director Wu's instructions, if necessary, a three-person committee can be formed by representatives from labor, management, and the Social Affairs Bureau to discuss solutions. However, Chairman Yan said that this is not a fundamental solution. Therefore, the directors and supervisors of the three associations decided to meet again at 3:00 PM on the 6th and visit Mayor Wu at 10:30 AM on the 7th to seek a reasonable solution.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Yilong, the former director of the Hongkou District Office of the People's Shipping Industry Association's resident police, was transferred to the Local Procuratorate yesterday by the Water Police Sub-bureau for investigation on suspicion of "fraud." During the war, from October of last year to May of this year, Liu, under the name of the Water Police Sub-bureau, recruited several resident police officers and privately collected uniform fees and introduction fees from slaughterers such as Shen Shaoqing, ranging from 200,000 to 1 million yuan per person, totaling about six to seven million yuan, which he pocketed and spent almost entirely.

### Residents of Xuhui District Petition; District Head Wronged; Falsely Accused of Accepting Bribes; Chen Xiaosong Guarantees Bao Dayong's Character

[Report from Our Newspaper] More than 300 representatives of residents, Baozhang representatives, Baoganshi representatives, merchants, and factory representatives of Xuhui District gathered to petition the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon because of the false accusation of District Head Bao Dayong accepting bribes, which aroused public indignation. According to the representatives, a lawless person named Zhou Yinchun used his evil influence to seize public land, mix up licenses, rebuild buildings, and endanger the safety of the neighborhood. The residents jointly reported this to various agencies and called for a halt. After the authorities sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and found it to be true, they ordered the demolition, recovered the land, and sent him to court for punishment. Unexpectedly, Zhou retaliated against District Head Bao and used Senator Xie Qingbai as a powerful background to trick Bao into eating, and then falsely accused Bao of accepting a bribe of 10 million yuan. Zhou's wife, Cheng Xiaobao, fabricated facts and filed a complaint with the Local Procuratorate. Therefore, they requested the transfer of a letter to the Local Court to expedite the investigation, reject the original lawsuit, severely punish Cheng Xiaobao for false accusation, and request the Municipal Government to strictly enforce the demolition of the buildings built by the Personnel Department, recover the occupied public land, and arrest and prosecute the fleeing Zhou Yinchun. Senators Fei Shuyin and Zhou Chengxiang received the representatives and reported to the conference. Later, Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Department said: (1) This case is currently being investigated by the court, and the Municipal Government should not interfere. (2) But I guarantee with my personal character that District Head Bao will never be corrupt. He himself has five or six shops and is usually very honest. This District Head is not my private person, but I also support him. In addition, Senator Zhou Xiangcheng also visited the house built by Zhou Yinchun last time and confirmed that there were violations of regulations. Finally, the conference decided: (3) The council will send a letter to the Municipal Government and the court to investigate and handle the case impartially. In addition, the three committees of Public Works, Autonomy, and Land Administration will jointly investigate the case. Huang Zhensheng especially requested the conference and the Municipal Government to pay attention to this kind of situation, which is very common in society. After Zhou Chengxiang reported the conference's decision to the representatives, the representatives left.

### Accurate Calculation of Inheritance Tax is Especially Difficult; Account Auditing for Profit Tax Avoids Harassment; Director of the Direct Taxation Bureau Answers Inquiries

[Report from Our Newspaper] Lou Guowei, Director of the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was invited by the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon, and various senators raised inquiries. Director Lou answered them one by one: (1) The best officials of the Finance Department have ordered the handling of profit tax audits in accordance with laws and regulations. This system is the most reasonable, fair, and good system. After the implementation, we will try our best to study how to avoid harassment and prevent fraud. Therefore, before the auditors carry out the audit, they will adopt a lottery method to ensure that they do not contact a certain shop or factory that they have audited in the past, and the audit date should not exceed two days to avoid collusion. If it exceeds the time limit, others will be sent to audit. At the same time, representatives from the industry association and the chamber of commerce are welcome to supervise. If there is any fraud, it will be dealt with according to law. (2) Regarding the return of account books, the Direct Taxation Bureau has no right to do so, but I (that is, last night) will send an urgent telegram to the authorities for instructions and will reply tomorrow (that is, today). (3) The current maximum denomination of stamp tax is 3,000 yuan, and those of 10,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan will be issued soon. (4) The inheritance tax is very difficult to implement thoroughly because the notification of declaration is inaccurate, so the investigation is very difficult, especially for movable property, which is more difficult to calculate. Lou's reply stopped here, because there was not enough time, it was resolved that Director Lou would attend again today to answer.

### Students Arrested for Minor Offenses to be Released at End of Semester

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhu Jingnong and other school officials of the arrested students in the city visited Mayor Wu at 10:00 AM yesterday. The mayor answered the questions raised by the Fudan professor, stating that students arrested for minor offenses should be released during the final exam period of this semester, and the school can allow them to take make-up exams. Those with more serious offenses will be released after being guided through education. Mayor Wu believes that if the schools insist on handing them over to the court for trial, it is also permissible. However, during the period of education, it is not intended to apply legal provisions. As for the students who should be arrested but have not yet been arrested, it is hoped that they can surrender themselves. As for other students who are not listed for arrest, if they continue to disrupt the school and society in an orderly manner, they will still be arrested. Finally, Mayor Wu replied to the representatives that the reason why students with minor offenses cannot be released immediately is for fear that they will be emotional after returning to school and "make waves" again.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd] Yesterday, Hong Kong newspapers reported that the Associated Press in Guangzhou reported on the 1st: "As a result of the anti-civil war parade held by 2,000 students of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou yesterday, five students were shot dead. In addition, many students were injured and missing." According to the Central News Agency reporter who accompanied the students throughout the parade that day, and the subsequent investigation, not a single student died, nor were any missing. This Associated Press report lacks concrete and accurate materials on the situation at the time. According to what this reporter knows, the most seriously injured student is Bai Jianxin, a second-year student of the Department of Foreign Languages ​​in the College of Arts, who is currently hospitalized in the United Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and is in critical condition. On the workers' side, four people were most seriously injured, one of whom, Liang Shaobo, is the most severely injured and in critical condition.

　　〔中央社廣州四日電〕當局為消弭因學生遊行而意起之學生工人糾紛，經行轅召集雙方代表，進行調解，三日晚已獲結束，雙方俱願自行約束，不再有類此事件發生。事由行轅，省市府，學生，工人，合組調解委會處理，免再發生校節。
[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th] In order to eliminate the student-worker disputes arising from the student parade, the authorities summoned representatives from both sides through the Executive Yuan for mediation. It concluded on the evening of the 3rd, and both parties are willing to restrain themselves and prevent similar incidents from happening again. The Executive Yuan, the provincial and municipal governments, students, and workers will jointly form a mediation committee to handle the matter, so as to avoid further conflicts.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 4th] The Wuhan University incident has entered the stage of complete resolution. This morning, Cheng Qian, Director of the Executive Yuan, handed a handwritten letter to Deputy Director Sun Weiruyi to take to Wuhan University to express condolences to the faculty and students of the school. The wording was extremely sincere, and the following measures were decided for the handling of the aftermath in response to the four requests made by the faculty association: (1) Punishment of the perpetrators: Investigate and identify the commanding officers whose deployment was inadequate and handled improperly, as well as the four people who fired the first shot, and order the Garrison Command to escort them to the Military Law Office of the Executive Yuan to investigate their responsibilities and severely punish them according to the law. (2) Compensation measures: Each of the three deceased students will be given a compensation fee of 40 million yuan and a burial fee of 10 million yuan to their families. Each seriously injured student will be given medical expenses of 10 million yuan, and another 20 million yuan will be distributed to lightly injured students (total medical and compensation expenses are 200 million yuan). (3) Security issues: In the future, the school authorities will be responsible for all student activities on campus, and no military or police will be sent to take action. However, if students engage in excessive actions outside the school that affect social security, the security agencies may still take appropriate preventive measures. (4) Release of arrested faculty and students: This has been fully implemented and does not need to be discussed further. In addition, the fact that a certain military police company commander on that day was able to comply with the code of conduct and never counterattack will be submitted for commendation in order to clarify right and wrong. According to reports, after this decision was announced, the grief of the faculty and students of the school was greatly comforted. People from all walks of life also deeply admire the government's sincerity in caring for young people and handling matters impartially. It is generally believed that this unfortunate incident will be completely resolved from now on.

征輪臨去秋波　昨大勝聖保羅　六五比四九分
Zhenglun shows final charm before departure; decisively defeats St. Paul yesterday; 65 to 49

　　〔本職訊〕美海軍聖保羅艦籃球隊昨晚七時約戰征輪於市體育館，球迷作壁上觀者千餘人，結果征輪以六十五比四十九大勝，上半時卅八比十九，下半時因征輪調動數人，使各隊員均獲活動機會，一顯身手，故下半時聖保羅反多得三分，征輪廿七，美軍三十分。
[Our post] The US Navy St. Paul warship basketball team played against Zhenglun at the City Gymnasium at 7 PM last night. Thousands of fans watched from the sidelines. As a result, Zhenglun won a decisive victory with a score of 65 to 49. The first half was 38 to 19. In the second half, because Zhenglun mobilized several players, all team members had the opportunity to move around and show their skills. Therefore, in the second half, St. Paul scored three more points, Zhenglun scored 27, and the US military scored 30.

　　聖保羅之球　，事前大義猜測，以致票價亦頗感難定，觀上半時之局勢，觀衆雖笑口皆開，但在演出方面似呈失望，安知下半時之愈戰愈勇，其作風與哥倫布相同，內以栢佛脫約瑟腦威門三人蛟佳，征輪昨晚得分特多，上半時更暢所欲為。材濟濟，几十二人之多，內有黑人名湯姆生，白背心襯上紅花白底洋布袴，怡然自得。
Before the St. Paul game, there was much speculation, so the ticket price was difficult to determine. Looking at the situation in the first half, the audience laughed, but seemed disappointed with the performance. Who knew that they would become more courageous in the second half? Their style was the same as Columbus. Among them, Butler, Joseph, and Nuoweimen were excellent. Zhenglun scored a lot of points last night and did whatever they wanted in the first half. There were many talented people, as many as twelve, including a black man named Tomson, who wore a white vest with a red flower and white background Western-style pants, and was very comfortable.

　　比賽七時發動，先舉行贈旗禮，美海軍聖保羅隊長拿馬爾於三十秒鐘內獨臂托入一球，使征輪變色。于瑞章藥忠强罰獨獲三分，海軍即暫停，屠得手，約瑟海爾均未罰中，後柏佛脫約瑟各有所得，奈我輜汽軍三劍客于蔡屠之不絕探籃，分數猛晋，十七比十時，聖保羅裴克易出拿馬爾，廿一比十奎爾司又易海耳。社腦溫與屠文龍均屬好手，雙方得分容易，行動均快速，方于瑞章擲球時，球已將近籃圈，被海爾拍出，足見脚下彈力甚强。二十分鐘過去，上半時相去剛一半，為卅八與十九之比，聖保羅落後一半。
The game started at 7 o'clock. First, a flag presentation ceremony was held. Lamar, the captain of the US Navy St. Paul team, shot a goal with one arm in 30 seconds, which made Zhenglun change color. Yu Ruizhang and Yao Zhongqiang uniquely earned three points by penalty. The Navy immediately suspended. Tu got the ball, but Joseph and Hale failed to score the penalty. Later, Butler and Joseph each gained something. However, the three musketeers of our transport army, Yu, Cai, and Tu, constantly explored the basket, and the score soared. At 17 to 10, St. Paul's Pek replaced Lamar, and at 21 to 10, Quiles replaced Hale again. She Nuowen and Tu Wenlong were both good players. Both sides scored easily and moved quickly. When Fang Yu Ruizhang threw the ball, the ball was close to the basket and was shot out by Hale, which showed that his leg elasticity was very strong. Twenty minutes passed, and the first half was just halfway through, with a ratio of 38 to 19. St. Paul was half behind.

　　競爭白熱　　下半時征輸因佔極地優勢，乃以新人參戰，于蔡屠外，爲：程飛·稽德臧·栢佛脫·約瑟罰進三分，屠罰中，約瑟又在藍下奪中一球，四十四比一十四，劉政軍調程飛聖保羅此間亦大事更動，川流不息，但善投籃者不多，僅仰賴約瑟栢佛脫拿馬爾撑市面而已。雙方競爭劇烈，一度曾見白熱化，各顯穿楊之技。長後十分鐘內形勢更緊，聖保羅大見起色，傳球較征輸說利，結果因上半時征輪之「過剩」，遠征軍仍得以六十五比四十九勝利。
The competition was fierce. In the second half, because Zhenglun occupied an extremely advantageous position, they used new players to participate in the war. In addition to Yu, Cai, and Tu, there were: Cheng Fei, Qi Dezang, Butler, and Joseph who scored three points on penalty. Tu scored the penalty, and Joseph scored another goal under the basket, 44 to 14. Liu Zhengjun adjusted Cheng Fei. St. Paul also made major changes during this period, with an endless stream of people, but there were not many who were good at shooting baskets, and they only relied on Joseph, Butler, and Lamar to support the market. The competition between the two sides was fierce, and at one point it became white-hot, with each showing their skills. The situation became tighter in the last ten minutes, and St. Paul greatly improved. Passing the ball was more advantageous than Zhenglun. As a result, due to Zhenglun's "excess" in the first half, the expeditionary force was still able to win with a score of 65 to 49.

Literary Psychology in the Publishing World
By Dan Meng, written by Zhu Guangqian, published by Kaiming Bookstore

Within the broad group of artistic youth, there is a widespread desire for several theoretical books that can help them break into the literary field, serving as stepping stones or guides. However, there is still a lack of a more effective handbook. Currently, there are many publications guiding young people in the initial stages of literary study, but they are usually either too superficial or overly specialized. The former leaves the reader with just a taste, unable to grasp the scenery of the entire literary world and understand the effort required to live in a literary atmosphere. The latter makes beginners shrink back or even cultivate rigid, scholastic ideas, confining themselves to libraries. In order to find a reading material that can bridge the gap between the above two levels, this book will be very suitable to fill this void.

The so-called "Literary Psychology" is just a type of "aesthetics." However, it differs from other aesthetics because this book has its unique direction. According to the author himself, this is a book that "studies aesthetics from a psychological perspective," a book that studies literary creation and appreciation, and even literary criticism. It not only covers abstract aesthetic principles but also empirically investigates the context of literary forms and content, thereby summarizing an overview of literature. The author's original intention was to write for young people who aspire to deeply love literature, so it is not superficial, preventing readers from being like a sailor talking about astronomy or a nurse talking about medical instruments, relying entirely on crude experience. Instead, it is based on an objective, systematic, and rigorous scientific understanding. It is also not too profound, preventing those who only have an interest in appreciating literature from refusing to accept it.

The main structure of this book is divided into two parts: literary creation and literary appreciation. Whether it is creation or appreciation, whether standing aside as an observer or expressing oneself within the situation, the first step is to refine some traditional views. It is not enough to rely solely on one's own miscellaneous experiences to be considered complete. The author pays attention to this point in every small section, so it has the advantages of a theoretical book without its flaws, grasping the effectiveness of a theoretical book without being detached from reality.

The author not only introduces some achievements of modern Western aesthetics but also adds his own insightful views, which surpasses all the common materials available. Although the author narrates from an objective standpoint, he also expresses his judgments and comments. He compares, compromises, and extends, carefully writing down his own views on the various schools of aesthetic thought that have been hotly discussed and debated in recent times. He may not have intended to create his own system, but his unique insights are indeed commendable. He seems to adopt the formalist aesthetics passed down from Kant to Croce as his belief, considering aesthetic experience to be purely an intuition of form. However, he can also break away from the theoretical constraints of Kant and Croce, recognizing that life is an organism, and thus opposing the mechanical view and abstract analysis of the Croce school.

Chapters one to four are preliminary analyses of the most fundamental question: "What is aesthetic experience?" "What are our psychological activities in aesthetic experience?" and "What kind of things can be considered beautiful?" The author presents them in a very engaging way, gradually explaining the four elements of aesthetic experience: "intuition of form," "psychological distance," "empathy," and "inner imitation." Each unit is analyzed and extended so thoroughly, with examples, metaphors, selections from famous Western philosophers, and the addition of some opinions from ancient Chinese sages, so that any reader not only understands the author's views but can also believe in them and apply them. The author moves from psychology to aesthetics with such proficiency, smoothness, and seamlessness!

Following chapter five is "Several Misunderstandings about Aesthetic Experience"; chapter six is "Aesthetics and Association." The former chapter is a supplement to the previous four chapters, pointing out three common misunderstandings and their explanations: (1) the confusion between aesthetic feeling and pleasure; (2) the confusion between aesthetic attitude and critical attitude; and (3) the confusion between simple sensory perception and rational thinking. The latter chapter connects the following chapters with the previous chapters and is an independent case.

Chapters seven and eight, "Literature and Morality," discuss the value issue of literary good and evil. Starting from chapter nine below, the core of aesthetics begins to be explored. Chapter nine, "Natural Beauty and Natural Ugliness - The Compromise between Naturalism and Idealism," resolves the long-standing conflicting views in literature; and further defines "beauty" and "ugliness," distinguishing the mystical interpretations of aesthetic standards. Chapter ten continues the conclusion of the previous chapter, "The beauty of art is not natural," and establishes a new standard of aesthetic theory, clarifying the fields of beauty, goodness, and truth. Here, the basic knowledge of aesthetics has been completely explained. Chapter eleven is a criticism of Croce's aesthetics, a very clever introduction and establishment, overflowing with the essence of communication.

Chapter twelve onwards marks the beginning of another major part. From "The Origin of Art and Games" to "The Creation of Art." Chapter thirteen talks about the basic conditions of "creation": imagination and inspiration; chapter fourteen talks about the complete conditions of "creation": talent and human effort. The content of these two chapters is the most complex and rich, comprehensively analyzing the difficult situation faced when an artwork is made, and finally saying that the creation of an artwork is quite arduous. Chapters fifteen onwards discuss specific issues in art: "Feminine Beauty and Masculine Beauty," "The Joy of Tragedy," and "Laughter and Comedy," which are the most relaxed and interesting three chapters in the book. Readers see thought-provoking revolutions in every light-hearted journey. The last three chapters are appendices, which respectively discuss the beauty of color, the beauty of form, and the beauty of sound, which are about painting, plastic arts, and music, all adopting the latest modern theories.

The middle part of this book roughly belongs to the study of literary creation, while the preceding and following paragraphs tend to focus on appreciation. However, it is never split too mechanically, because appreciation is also a reflection of creation, so the author explains them individually and comprehensively. At the same time, although this book is "psychological," it also explores the truth of literary touches physiologically, socially, and philosophically. Its strengths will include the following three points: (1) Practical: Each chapter and each section never engages in empty talk but reasons from a practical process; (2) Scientific: The author never is idealistic nor mechanically unfolds his own thoughts; (3) Critical: It is not just a textbook or a similar product. Everywhere, one can see the author's choice and measurement of traditional truths, but it is also not narrow-minded. In addition, what is even more commendable is the author's writing style, which is so fluent and interesting, unlike the dryness of general theoretical books. Because of these points and the urgent need to introduce it to others, although this book is now reprinted, because the first edition has not been sold widely, it is still so new that everyone who has not read it is eager to read it as soon as possible. It is an interesting book.
### Biography of Romain Rolland
By Yang Tongfang, Translated by Ronald A. Wilson, Translated by Shen Lianzhi
Published by: Cultural Life Publishing House
Publication Date: First edition, January of the 36th year [of the Republic]

Romain Rolland is a pioneer in the modern ideological world, and the brilliance of his thoughts shines in every corner of the world. Our need to understand Romain Rolland can be said to be multifaceted, because he is not only a great historian, biographer, and playwright, but also an unparalleled poet and prophet in France, and even more so a transcendent thinker and a courageous pacifist.

To understand this outstanding figure of the era from these aspects, the recently published "Biography of Romain Rolland" should be worth reading. The original author, the American Ronald A. Wilson, has an excellent understanding of Rolland's thoughts. He has compiled a collection of his usual thematic studies on this great thinker. Although they are several articles that can stand alone, they have a consistent thought. From here, we can easily get a glimpse of the lifelong struggle of a groundbreaking thinker.

The full sound is divided into nine chapters: Chapter One "Early Life", Chapter Two "Early Plays", Chapter Three "Beethoven Biography", Chapter Four "Michelangelo Biography", Chapter Five "Tolstoy Biography", Chapter Six "Romain Rolland: Scholar and Poet", Chapter Seven "Romain Rolland's Hero", Chapter Eight "English Biography and John, Christopher", Chapter Nine "Romain Rolland and New Idealism." An appendix includes "Two Letters from Romain Rolland to American Friends". Each narrative is very clear and lively, able to grasp the essence of Rolland's thought. It can be regarded as a history of Rolland's life or as a history of Rolland's creation. Ordinary people only superficially regard Rolland as an ordinary writer, but in fact, Rolland's works are a reflection of his ideological and life struggles. From his ordinary life to his later years, he always pursued a lofty ideal in life. As A. Seche said, his life is permeated with the power of conscience and morality, and he tirelessly strives to realize his beliefs - beauty, love, and love of life. Yes, Rolland's prestige is great enough, and each of his works is full of the vitality of life.

Rolland is the greatest biographer in modern French literary circles. Although he has also written many plays, essays, and poems, his thoughts can be represented by several world-renowned biographies. Rolland wrote biographies not only to conduct historical research but to display the great personality and sentiments of a biographical figure. He writes about the many forms of life of biographical figures through extremely precise observations. He creates based on a firm belief and love for life and thought, so his works can deeply grasp people's hearts, vivid and powerful, bright and sincere, which greatly moves the reader.

I feel that Rolland's life includes a process of struggling with thought and life. His works are full of love for humanity. He sings praises of human spiritual beauty and intellectual beauty. All evils in society must be remedied by spiritual beauty and intellectual beauty. Only freedom and democracy can create human harmony and social progress. The artistic value of Rolland's biographical works is especially expressed in the fine details of the characters' lives, often avoiding those prominent actions written by general historians. From trivial daily life, even a single word or sentence, can arouse inner excitement.

Romain Rolland's early life already nurtured the seeds of his later great thoughts. A tranquil and beautiful living environment gave him the opportunity to contemplate silently. The musical education of his childhood nourished his lonely mood, using music, the most beautiful language, to purify his thoughts and inspire his aspirations. Music gave him a great life force, which later influenced him in his creative work, whether it was biography or drama. Everyone knows that Rolland has unparalleled love for mankind. He curses social evils and calls for human cooperation. This great enlightenment, according to himself, is indeed due to the cultivation of music. Music can reveal the truth, express the common demands of mankind, and emotionally enable people to achieve deep sympathy and understanding between each other.

After I completed Wilson's "Biography of Romain Rolland," my narrow thoughts and feelings were sublimated into a kind of aspiration and expectation for mankind. Romain Rolland's thoughts belong to the people, to all mankind. His new idealism destroys all the meanness and selfishness, corruption and malice in the world. He leads mankind to a new stage in history, establishing universal human love with the creative touch of a poet. How lofty is his ideal in life, how great is his creative purpose!

Romain Rolland's name, some say, is a symbol of free thought. His life is one of fighting, of courage, never bowing to fate, only knowing how to constantly challenge the darkness of life. He believes that people can only find the fountain of life by living in suffering. From his letters to his American friends, one can see what a historian, thinker, and poet he is, who is loyal to life and loyal to creation, leading mankind towards a new century.

In the current stage of worldwide chaos, human suspicion and hatred have not been eradicated with the Second World War. We deeply regret the death of this pioneering thinker. His homeland has finally struggled out of Nazi enslavement, but he quietly left the world, which is really heartbreaking.

Therefore, I recommend this "Biography of Romain Rolland" to people who love justice and peace. Although it is not a monumental masterpiece, Wilson's writing is full of beautiful literary interest, and it does not make people feel boring. Shen Lianzhi's translation can also achieve fluency and elegance, with a trace of poetic atmosphere seeping out from between the lines, which is very worthwhile to let people understand.
### Review of "Social Monthly"
By Jin Wen
Publisher: Social Monthly Society (Inside the Shanghai Linsen Road Social Bureau)
Editor: Yuan Wenzhang
Price: 2,000 yuan per issue

This is a periodical published by various competent departments of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, publishing business reports, publishing social laws and regulations, discussing social issues, and analyzing social phenomena. From its founding on July 5th of the 35th year [of the Republic], it has now reached the third issue of the second volume. Looking at the contents of each issue, I deeply feel that this "Social Monthly" is worth reviewing.

Social administration is a new administration in our country; social undertakings are a kind of modern undertaking; and social problems are varied and complex, and are also the most important problems that cause cutting pain to everyone today. However, publications that review social administration, social undertakings, and study social problems are uniquely lacking today. In the past, there were research magazines on sociology, but they had too much of an academic flavor and rarely discussed practical issues. And the "Social Monthly" is indeed the only publication today that studies social administration, social undertakings, and social problems. Although this monthly is run by the government, it has no official bulletin flavor at all, which is valuable. Therefore, it can always maintain a lively style and a pragmatic attitude.

As for the content, based on the nine issues that I have read, the advantages and disadvantages are equally visible, which are briefly described as follows:

Regarding the advantages of the content of the "Social Monthly": 1. The data value is relatively high. Each issue of the journal has data-based papers, and the materials strive for credibility, and the descriptions are concise and essential. The data value is indeed not bad. For example, the articles "Shanghai Labor Dispute Statistics" each month, "The Trend of the Publishing Industry in Shanghai," "The Past and Present of the Shanghai Manual Labor Mutual Aid Society," and "The Evolution of the Shanghai Social Bureau" are mostly available for sociological researchers to refer to. 2. Business reports and policy guidelines are fully revealed in the journal, which can enable readers to understand the social administration and social undertakings of Shanghai. 3. Laws and regulations and appendices all publish important laws and regulations, with conspicuous compilation and convenient review, without the cumbersome nature of general government gazettes. It is convenient for readers to refer to.

Regarding the disadvantages of the "Social Monthly": 1. Research reports on social surveys in Shanghai are lacking; 2. There is a lack of papers that interpret social administrative laws and regulations. Past social laws, such as the "Social Relief Law," the "National Compulsory Labor Law," and the "Trade Union Law" currently under review, are all worth interpreting, which is very helpful for readers and social administrative personnel to refer to. The lack of these in the journal is indeed regrettable; 3. There is a slight lack of papers on sociological theories and social policies. I believe... a publication with a very high standard that pays attention to the practical effectiveness of social administration should not have this shortcoming.

Based on a review of the overall content, the "Social Monthly" is indeed a valuable publication. Its important features are its rigorous compilation, pragmatic content, and credible data. I would like to recommend it to readers. As for the shortcomings I mentioned, they are just personal opinions. If necessary, I hope the editors will further enrich the content.
### "The Idiot"
By Shi Pei, written by Fyodor Dostoevsky, translated by Geng Jizhi, published by Kaiming Publishing House

In 1867, Dostoevsky, in order to escape the pursuit of greedy creditors, took his newly married wife on a trip abroad. During the four years of travel, he completed two immortal novels, "The Idiot" and "Demons".

"The Idiot" tells the story of a young Duke Myshkin, who is in love with two young girls. Nastasya, an orphaned daughter of a small landowner, became a pitiful, self-abandoning woman because she lost herself to Rogozhin. This made the Duke develop an almost fateful pity and love for her. At the same time, when the Duke went to General Yepanchin's house, he was also attracted by the charming love of the General's daughter, Aglaya. She was a proud and pure virgin, and they fell in love passionately shortly after meeting. Therefore, Duke Myshkin was caught in the middle of these two women, and he did not know what to do. One was an almost fanatical love, and the other was a warm and considerate love. The twists and turns evolved to the end. Just when the Duke decided to hold a wedding ceremony with Nastasya, the unfortunate Nastasya was kidnapped and murdered by Rogozhin. Before this happened, General's daughter Aglaya had become a madman, and as a result, the Duke completely fell into mental confusion. This tragic ending concludes this story of love and entanglement between hearts.

Although "The Idiot" is a love novel, Dostoevsky does not start from the needs of human carnal love, but extracts the issues of the mutual relationship between people in the world, the pain of life, and the issues of conscience, good and evil as viewpoints, and uses these clues to form another side of real life, deeply and clearly touching on the essence of life. After reading it, we unconsciously develop a deep sympathy for the characters in the book. Therefore, the structure of "The Idiot" can give us a special and high degree of inspiration, which is very different from other ordinary love novels.

In this book, Dostoevsky wrote with brilliant and sharp writing, and there are many scenes that moved me. Among them, the real feeling of facing death on the execution ground, and the inner experience of being attacked by epilepsy, are described in great detail. This is a rare and valuable realistic writing.

Because during 1849, Dostoevsky was arrested for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle with the crime of "ideological conspiracy." In fact, this group did not have any active plans, but was only a combination of some young people for the purpose of studying and discussing general social thoughts. However, the autocratic and tyrannical Nicholas I did not let go of these "free thinkers." At the end of that year, Dostoevsky and his friends who were arrested together were sentenced to death. They had all made a sad decision, thinking that they would die in a few minutes. Just when they were hesitating between life and death, the Emperor's order suddenly changed, and the death sentence was reduced to exile. Dostoevsky personally received this terrible stimulus, and his heart was forever buried with this engraved memory. Moreover, Dostoevsky himself suffered from epilepsy, which was the greatest misfortune that accompanied him throughout his life. "The Idiot" is his way of expressing the above two kinds of unfortunate emotions and feelings by describing the life of the protagonist Duke Myshkin, which is vividly displayed and deeply touches the hearts of readers.

In "The Idiot", Dostoevsky wanted to create Duke Myshkin as a gentle and humble, truly perfect person. He has such a pure soul and such a simple and purified personality, but he is regarded as an idiot by others; even so, his simple, child-like wisdom comforts all those who come into contact with him with a spirit of light and friendship. The author's use of this descriptive technique is very complete and successful.

After reading this book, I have silently been thinking, we live in today's society where deception is trending against the tide. I wonder how many truly kind people are regarded as "idiots" by others; conversely, I wonder how many evil people are worshipped as "saints"? Readers of this immortal masterpiece may always have infinite feelings.
### Free Talk on Dance Ban and Great Prevention
By Luo Bi

From the opening to the closing of the Political Participation Council, everything is important, but between the tension and solemnity, we once heard a relaxed laugh and saw an interesting scene, that is, the proposal to ban dancing by Senator Zhang Zhijiang.

The discussion of banning dancing and dancing has seemed to last a long time in our country. However, before, some people advocated banning dancing because of frugality and morality. This time, Zhang's advocacy for banning dancing is more serious. It is called: Great Prevention.

The theory of the great prevention between men and women seems to have been a thing of the past for a long time, but those who are as determined as Zhang see that "social dances between men and women are taught and received intimately, and men and women hug and entwine closely when dancing. This not only removes the gradual prevention of society but also opens the door to convenience," which is ultimately difficult to tolerate and unwilling to remain silent.

Dancing in our country flows to the entertainment of sensuality and pleasure, which is a fact. "I don't know how many people are tempted to be fascinated and unable to extricate themselves" is also a true experience. Today, it is a very common phenomenon for underage students to carry their schoolbags to the dance floor. However, "to protect the dignity of the Republic of China, it should be strictly prohibited" is a bit of an exaggeration. This is not only because dancing has nothing to do with the issue of face, but also because social dance between men and women is not a domestic product but one of the European styles that has gradually spread eastward. In jazz music, foreigners are probably more accustomed to it.

Dancing itself is not a sin, so it is okay to correct the bad phenomenon of today's dance style, but it is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater to block normal social interaction between men and women because of it. Speaking of great prevention, it can be said to have been flourishing a hundred years ago, but how many stories like backyard gardens have been left to us? This is why the theory of separate schools for men and women has also been criticized by experts today.

It is only when there is no prevention between men and women that there can be great prevention. This is a principle that is opposite but complementary. It is also unreasonable to measure today with the moral standards of a hundred years ago. As for criticizing dancing for leading to love, is it still an era when marriage should be based on matchmakers today?

Although it is said that today's dancing and the "dancing with sword" of the past are very different, in terms of dancing itself, it is only a legitimate social interaction, and it does not expect it to be a training of skills. Before the social relationship between our men and women is fully reasonable today, dancing as a legitimate social interaction is still worth maintaining, I think.
### Mysterious Twins
Translated by Xin Zi

Experts who study twins say that twins are not only similar in body and appearance, but also in the path of life that each of them takes. Although it is very different due to the environment, the reaction to encounters often has amazing and incredible similarities.

We know that the lifespan of each person's organs is already destined in the womb. Some experts have obtained an interesting fact from a group of twins aged from fifty to eighty, that is, the physical changes of each twin are obviously very similar. Even the first gray hair on their heads will be born at the same time and in the same place. As for the shape of baldness, it will also be consistent.

Professor Furt carefully observed the growth of nineteen pairs of twins. He found that the wrinkles on the forehead, cheeks, mouth, and eyes of each pair of twins were the same. Their teeth would deteriorate at the same time. No matter how far apart they lived, if one of them suffered pain or encountered unfortunate things, the other would also be affected at the same time. This often discovered fact has become the most mysterious phenomenon in this question.

The British once reported about the twins Thomas and Stuck. Thomas was a five-year-old child. He lived not far from Manchester. He and a group of children were busy setting up a tent. One of the older children wanted to use an axe to nail the wooden piles into the ground. When he raised the axe to prepare to hammer the wooden piles hard, he unfortunately injured Thomas's left eye, who was standing behind. Immediately he was sent to the hospital, and the doctor performed surgery on his eyes. Unexpectedly, a few hours later, his twin brother William also felt pain in his left eye, and after sleeping he quickly asked the doctor to see him. Later, their father said that the two brothers could get the same ear pain, toothache or other similar diseases at the same time.

Another strange thing is that when a young man was walking at home, he suddenly felt a severe headache. Soon, he fainted. Twenty-four hours later, he learned that when he had a headache, his twin brother in another city had fallen off a horse and suffered a serious head injury.

The Paris newspapers also reported the simultaneous death of a pair of twin brothers. One of the twins was a woodcarver. He suddenly fainted while walking in the forest not far from Paris. And his twin brother also died in the same forest. The three Baldini triplets in Italy gave scientists even more information. One of the brothers died in Rome due to a car accident. One or two hours later, the second brother died of heart failure without knowing that the first brother had died. On the same night, the third brother died in Milan, and it was also heart disease.

The universe is mysterious, and the fact of twins is also mysterious. When will we be able to discover all the secrets?
### Racial Discrimination
By Wu Derun

The United Press issued the following dispatch from New York: In the case of white people lynching black people in Carolinian, South America, all 31 defendants were acquitted by the local court and released. White people in the southern states of the United States are rejoicing, but the world sees it as a "violent trial."

It is indeed news and an incredible miracle that such a thing has happened in a civilized and advanced country. The defendants have all admitted to the murder, but they are still acquitted and released. Apart from relying on the "unwritten law" of "racial selling", there is really no other explanation.

Of course, these white people will feel happy. But I think that is just the view of a small group of ignorant people, and the rejoicing may be a fluke and daily. Therefore, in addition to the London Daily Express feeling: "violent trial" is still the "unwritten law" of the United States, most of the southern states also expressed dissatisfaction. The Atlanta Report stated: The conscience of the people has been shaken; this is the government's verdict. The District Times stated: The entire country will be stained by this verdict. The Memphis Commercial Appeal stated: This is a tragic day for the judiciary in the southern United States. The Birmingham Pioneer stated: People in the South also have increased feelings about it.

However, in civilized and advanced countries, after class discrimination is eliminated, racial discrimination still exists, and it is grandly used as a judicial verdict. How can it not arouse people's deep thought and lament!
### Japanese Deaths
By Chen Zhongsheng

The deaths of Japanese people are still bizarre. In Fukushima Prefecture, there was a 53-year-old man named Honichi Morita, who was defeated by a close friend in the election of the Sakazawa Village Council. In order to express his apology, he resolutely committed suicide by cutting his abdomen. In Tanimura, there was a man named Setsu Yotsumura last week, who was overly saddened by the defeat of the local election candidate he supported, and eventually committed suicide by cutting his tongue. In the crime-ridden Tokyo, there was a 24-year-old named Seki Arai, who threw himself under a train because "After enlisting in the police force, he discovered that the world was corrupt, fickle, and it was better to die than to train as a policeman in a chaotic world."

According to the bulletin of the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Transport, 1,241 Japanese people attempted suicide last year for some reason using the same method, of which 970 were successful. In Tokyo, a former paratrooper, Kanzo Kuriyama, was penniless last month and jumped from the 811-foot-high bathroom chimney to seek death. According to the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office: "This person had previously undergone paratrooper training, and the embers under the chimney were gentle, so he failed to achieve his ambition."
### Wen'an Prison - Random Notes on Reading History, Part Four
By Xiao Dai

First, let's talk about the background of Zhu Yuanzhang, the Ming Taizu.

The History of Ming says:

"Taizu... Emperor Gao's name was Yuanzhang, courtesy name Guorui, surname Zhu. His ancestors were from Pei, moved to Gouke, and then moved to Sizhou. His father, Shizhen, first moved to Zhongli in Haozhou. He had four sons, Taizu being the youngest... In the fourth year of Zhizheng [of Yuan Dynasty], there was drought, locusts, and a great plague. Taizu was seventeen that year, and his parents and brother died one after another... Taizu lost his support, so he entered the Huangjue Temple as a monk. After more than a month, he traveled and ate in Hefei... Three years later, he returned to the temple. At that time, the Yuan government was disorganized, and bandits rose everywhere... In the spring of the thirteenth year... Taizu recruited soldiers from the village and got seven hundred people. Zi Xing (Guo Zixing) was happy and appointed him as Zhenfu..."

It is by no means an easy task for a person who was a monk to unify the world and become the emperor of the Great Ming Empire. After taking power, he naturally wanted to stabilize his supreme position that had been obtained. So on the one hand, he did not allow the princes to have governing power, and at the same time, he tried his best to increase his autocratic authority in the government. Anyone who insulted this authority was killed without mercy.

Ming Taizu's "suspicion and fondness for killing" is appalling. The Twenty-Two History Notes on the Hu-Lan Prison states: "Only Ming Taizu, who used meritorious officials to seize the world, killed all the people who seized the world after the world was settled. His cruelty was unprecedented. His suspicion and fondness for killing were his nature." Ming Taizu not only slaughtered civil and military meritorious officials but also massacred scholars. This can be roughly seen by looking at the literary inquisition in the early Ming Dynasty.

Ming Taizu avoided the word "Ze" [則] because the pronunciation of Lan [藍] "Ze" is close to "thief" [賊]. He avoided "Sheng Zhi" [生知] because the pronunciation is close to "monk" [僧]. He avoided "Di Fei" [帝扉] because it is similar to "Emperor is wrong" [帝非]. He avoided "Fa Kun" [法坤] because it is similar to "shaved hair" [髮髡]... At that time, it was impossible to count the number of people who were punished on suspicion. Casual Records of Ancient and Modern Times states:

"Xu Yijian, a professor in Hangzhou, had the words 'Light' under heaven and 'Born' saint, making 'rules' for the world in his congratulatory statement. The emperor read it and was furious, saying: 'Sheng' means monk, because I was once a monk; 'Guang' means miscellaneous hair; 'Ze' sounds like thief. So he was beheaded. The officials of the Ministry of Rites were terrified, so they asked to lower the form of the statement, and the emperor personally wrote the article and spread it to the world. Also, the monk Lai Fu's poem of thanks had the line 'Foreign domains and self-shame, I have no virtue to praise Tao Tang.' The emperor said: You use the word 'Shu,' which means that I am a bad Zhu. You also said 'I have no virtue to praise Tao Tang,' which means that I have no virtue, even if I want to praise me with Tao Tang, I cannot. So he was beheaded."

This is very much like Ah Q, who avoided people saying the words "scab" and "light" because he was "scab-headed," and he hated and resented those who said bright and light words. Like this kind of nitpicking and intentional killing, it was even more intensified in the late Qing Dynasty. Literary inquisition spanned several periods.

For example, during the reign of Emperor Tianqi of Ming Dynasty, Li Guozhen of Huzhou wrote the Ming History Summary (also known as the Ming Book), and his review praised Zhu Shishi, which was later obtained by Zhuang Tingfan of the Qing Dynasty and published to the world in the seventeenth year of Shunzhi. In the eighteenth year, it was reported, so all the editors of the book and the children and daughters of the Kun family were beheaded, involving nearly a hundred people. Pingwang Zhi records:

"Guo Kuian's name was Yan, and Pan Litian's name was Zhang. Their talents were comparable. In the second month of the Kangxi Gui Mao year (Yongli seventeenth year, that is, 1663 AD), they were both implicated in the Zhuang family history prison in Nanxun and were sent to the Hulin military camp. On the fifth day of May of that year, Wu and Pan were both executed in Bizhifang in Hangzhou, along with more than seventy others who died. More than a hundred people were exiled."

Another example is Lü Liuliang of Zhejiang, who advocated nationalism and wrote books against the Manchus. His writings contained a poem that said: "The clear wind is too weak to blow me, and the bright moon never fails to shine on people?" In the fifth year of Yongzheng, Yue Zhongqi, the chief constable of Sichuan, reported to the authorities, and a great prison arose. As a result, Lü Liuliang and his eldest son, Lü Baozhong, and his disciple, Yan Hongda, were all punished for exposing their corpses because they had already died. Lü Yizhong, the second son of Liuliang, was beheaded, and the remaining Japanese children and grandchildren were sent to Ningguta as slaves, and the women were sent to the government.

The Ming and Qing dynasties were equally cruel in killing scholars, but their purposes were different. The former wanted to consolidate their autocratic authority, while the latter wanted to eliminate anti-Manchu thoughts. Therefore, scholars who understood "how to protect themselves wisely" simply closed their doors and studied Lao-Zhuang philosophy like in the Six Dynasties. The sudden rise of textual research in the Qing Dynasty was due to this.
### Story of a City in Danger
By Qin Shouou

"But, don't forget, you are an only child!" The reasons listed by Zhang Chang were actually not unknown to Lao Zhu, and he also admitted that these reasons were correct, but he could not bear to implicate Zhang Chang.

"Life and death are destined, Lao Zhu, don't think of me as so pampered!" Zhang, who was bold and had a big temper, said very excitedly.

"Well, very good, since you don't cherish your life to make me this friend, what else can I say?" Lao Zhu said with a slightly contemptuous look. Fei Fei also had the same stubborn personality as her father. Lao Zhu said many good words to her, but to no avail. Later, Lan called her over and coaxed her for a while before she reluctantly agreed to go with Lao Zhu.

When he was about to get up, Lao Zhu repeatedly urged Zhang Chang, teaching him to pay attention to not getting infected himself. At the same time, he also wrote down the addresses of the correspondence offices that could be used in Dushan, Duyun, and Guiyang one by one, asking him to find a way to make a phone call or ask someone to bring a letter at any time.

Lu Qian also walked over with a sad face, and without saying a word quickly, he just sighed and walked away again. Zhang Chang took it over and looked, and it turned out to be the gold ring that Lu Limper often wore, which everyone often teased him was a wedding ring. Lao Zhu also saw it, and smiled at his back.

"Poor friends are all good!" he said to himself.

Zhang Chang hesitated for a moment, and finally hid the ring in his pocket. "Lu Limper is stubborn, and you can't argue with him. Besides, Mrs. Hu's illness is too severe, and it may take many days to delay. Thank him for me!" he said to Lao Zhu.

Lao Zhu nodded slightly.

Guan was carried by two male team members in a shaking chair. When the driver saw it, he seemed to want to go back on his word again. After Zhu Zhaonian and Zhang Chang repeatedly persuaded him, he reluctantly agreed with the condition that "he would only go to Hechi and would not be allowed to go up again no matter what."

### Reader Consultation: Legal Interpretation

Xie Yinqiu asks: I have several legal questions and would like you to answer them: (1) According to common custom, children all take their father's surname. Is there an explicit provision in the law regarding this? (2) Under what circumstances can children take their mother's surname to preserve the lineage? (3) What is "surnaming"? Please explain in detail. (4) Under what circumstances can a surname be changed, and what are the legal procedures?

[Lawyer Cao Yapu's answer] (1) According to Article 1059, Paragraph 1 of our country's current Civil Code, "Children take their father's surname." Therefore, children taking their father's surname is not only a matter of custom but also stipulated by law. (2) Children may take their mother's surname under the following circumstances: (A) Children born to a husband must take their mother's surname according to Article 1059, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, unless otherwise agreed; (B) Children born out of wedlock all take their mother's surname unless legal procedures have been completed to obtain the status of legitimate children. (3) Adding another person's "surname" to one's own "surname" is called surnaming, such as a wife taking her husband's surname or a husband taking his wife's surname (matrilocal marriage), etc. (4) According to Article 3 of the Regulations for Reviewing Name Changes, Surname Changes, and Surnaming, promulgated by the Ministry of Interior on June 8, 1933, "A request to change a surname may be submitted under any of the following circumstances: (1) inheritance or returning to the clan; (2) non-Han people requesting to adopt a Han surname." The procedure for changing a surname follows the provisions of Article 7 of the same regulations. Those who apply to change their surname according to Article 3, Item 1 must submit a formal and legal written agreement from family members and relatives waiving or acknowledging the inheritance, or acknowledging the return to the clan, stating the age, origin, residence, occupation, and experience, the names of both parents and their ages and occupations, and obtain guarantees from at least two clan elders and two reputable local businesses, along with two 4-inch half-body photos of the applicant and documents proving their qualifications. After the local county or city government investigates and confirms the information, it shall be submitted to the superior government for review and forwarded to the Ministry of Interior. If the inheritance or return to the clan of the applicant mentioned in the preceding paragraph is in another location, it must also be submitted separately to the relevant county or city governments for investigation and joint review for forwarding."

### Assembly Passes Urgent Motion; Attention to Drafting of Peace Treaty with Japan

[Our Report] Yesterday's Senate Assembly also discussed several temporary motions: (1) The motion proposed by 39 senators including Xu Jiguang and Wang Zhengting, "Telegraph the Central Government to resolutely implement the constitution as scheduled, quickly prepare for elections in various regions, and fully allow the people to freely elect," stated in its rationale that "It has recently been heard that the number of seats in future elections in various regions will be pre-arranged and distributed by various parties, which is alarming. Our country's general election is just beginning, and various parties have no fixed number of National Assembly representatives or legislators on which to base this. Furthermore, this is not a time of war, so the government cannot arbitrarily allocate seats to various parties with sweet talk and limit them. In particular, the people's right to vote must be exercised freely and fully, and the government must not interfere." As a result, the motion was passed by the Assembly. (2) The motion proposed by 36 senators including Xu Jiguang and Tao Baichuan, "Suggest organizing a committee to investigate all activities that violate the interests of the Chinese people to assist the government in stabilizing society," stated the following measures: "(1) The council shall immediately elect several senators to form a "Committee for Investigating Activities that Violate the Interests of the Chinese People" with responsible persons from reputable social figures and major agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic organizations in the city. The main task is to thoroughly investigate all activities within the city that violate the interests of the Chinese people, obtain accurate results, and publish them to the public when necessary. (2) The council shall send telegrams to the central government and civil opinion organs in various provinces and cities to unanimously launch this organization to ensure that elements with international backgrounds who are lurking throughout the country and orchestrating activities that violate the interests of the Chinese people are exposed for who they are." The Assembly resolved to adopt the motion as is and implement it seriously. (3) The motion proposed by 34 senators including Huang Shijin and Ma Junshuo, "Propose launching a Shanghai Municipal Assistance for Education Movement Committee to reduce the number of students dropping out of school and benefit education," was resolved as follows: The council shall send a letter to the municipal government requesting the selection and appointment of social figures to organize the Shanghai Municipal Assistance for Education Movement Committee. Ma Junshuo, Wang Wei, and others proposed a temporary emergency motion: "Propose urgently telegraphing the national government, requesting attention to the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan and resolutely opposing Japan's joint management of the Ryukyu Islands and obtaining special immigration privileges to Taiwan," which was resolved as follows: Passed.
