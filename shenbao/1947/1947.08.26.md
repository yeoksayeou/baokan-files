### Adjusting County-Level Institutional Finances, Carefully Selecting and Rigorously Examining County-Level Personnel: The Executive Yuan Reaffirms Prior Order and Circulars for Compliance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan recently issued a circular to various ministries, commissions, and provincial governments, regarding adjusting county-level institutional finances, reducing concurrent posts and constraints of county magistrates, and carefully selecting and rigorously examining county-level personnel. The original text is as follows:

The nation is in the aftermath of a protracted war of resistance, compounded by the rebellion of the communist bandits. Local areas are in extreme chaos and destitution. The key to governance lies in sorting out and rectifying the situation, focusing on ways to promote recovery and education. Local administrative institutions should strive for rationality and compactness, local construction funds should be earmarked for specific purposes, and the quality of officials should aim for competence. Only when objective conditions are largely met can local politics be effective. If we continue to adhere to old ways and be constrained by the status quo, failing to adapt to changing circumstances, how can we satisfy the people's hope for recovery and establish the foundation for local autonomy? In May of the 35th year [1946], this Yuan, following the Chairman's handwritten instructions and the order from the Executive Yuan (Fu Jiao Jing) on May 11th, dispatched instruction No. 1659 of Jing Jia Ding to all provincial governments, ordering them to seek to enrich local tax revenues to solve the financial difficulties at the county level and to adjust county-level institutions based on local financial conditions. Furthermore, regarding respecting the authority of county magistrates and reducing their concurrent posts, the central government has repeatedly formulated measures and issued circulars for compliance, all on record. Recently, at an administrative symposium, many provincial chairmen still cited the excessive size of county-level institutions, the difficulty in raising funds, the scarcity of talent, and the lack of exclusive authority and excessive constraints of county magistrates. This indicates that the previous orders issued by the central government have not been effectively implemented in many localities. We hereby reaffirm the previous orders and provide detailed regulations as follows:

I. Regarding streamlining county-level institutions: A review of the organizational outlines for counties at all levels reveals that while the various departments and offices of the county government are listed comprehensively, it was clarified that the number of departments should be determined by each provincial government based on the county's grade and actual needs, and it was not rigidly stipulated that all must be uniformly established. However, in reality, most counties have universally established all the units listed in the outline, and quite a few have successively added units beyond those stipulated in the outline, resulting in bloated organizations and excessive waste. Provincial governments should re-evaluate the county's grade, financial surplus, and actual needs, and determine the organization of each county government, with a maximum limit of five departments and two offices (from the secretary to the accounting office) and a minimum of three departments and one office (the accounting director attached to the secretary's office) (remote, particularly small counties with limited funds and simple matters are exempt). This will prevent excessive disparity in the organization of each county, and expenses can be largely self-sufficient. The departments should be renamed with first and second ordinal numbers to allow for the allocation of their responsibilities based on the complexity of the matters. All other originally established units such as statistics, cooperation, guidance, land registration, organization, weights and measures verification, etc., should retain necessary personnel and assign them to work in departments and offices of similar nature, under the supervision and direction of the heads of those departments and offices, to carry out their specialized duties. Provincial governments are required to comply with and properly plan within one month of receiving this document, supervise and instruct each county to effectively adjust, and report the newly determined organizational regulations of each county government to the Yuan for record. This time, the compulsory streamlining is due to local financial difficulties, the inability to improve salaries, and the lack of development in undertakings. We must strive to economize to promote revitalization. Once local finances are rectified and sufficient, and autonomous undertakings are gradually developed, if there is a need to moderately increase units and expand the organization, it can still be submitted to the provincial government for approval after being passed by the representative bodies. The overall aim is to vigorously implement streamlining to reverse the current decline, and not to prolong simplicity and frugality, which would hinder future development.

### Increasing Allocation of Local Tax Sources, Strictly Prohibiting Arbitrary Apportionment, Reducing Concurrent Posts of County Magistrates to Focus on Responsibilities

II. Regarding adjusting county-level finances: Since the amendment of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system law, county-level finances have had broader tax sources than before, such as allocating half of the land tax, allocating all of the deed tax, and allocating most of the business tax to local areas. However, due to the failure to earnestly collect taxes, the tax rates are not very appropriate, and the amount of revenue is not as expected. Moreover, provincial governments often exercise excessive control over county-level finances, resulting in many counties being unable to be self-sufficient. The central government should appropriately increase the allocated tax sources, such as the native tobacco tax and native wine tax, and appropriately adjust the tax rates, such as the slaughter tax, banquet tax, entertainment tax, vehicle license tax, business license tax, and house tax. The Executive Yuan is instructing the Ministry of Finance to quickly deliberate and submit them for approval. Once the draft laws are completed, they will be issued for implementation. Land tax is a major source of local revenue. Provincial governments should immediately order the competent authorities and commissioners of each district to supervise and instruct their subordinate counties to effectively organize and clarify the tax registers, inspect concealments, improve tax collection, and eliminate corruption. Commissioners should be stationed in each county under their jurisdiction to oversee the clarification and ensure that public school property funds are used for public purposes. Those with insufficient ordinary tax sources but substantial yields from special products can levy special taxes in accordance with item 10 of Annex (1) 2 of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system law, such as animal husbandry in the northwest, marine products in the southeast, medicinal materials in mountain areas, and special crops. This can both provide resources for the people's livelihood and serve as a source of taxation for the government. However, it should not violate central tax laws and regulations or hinder national economic development, and it must be approved by the county council and the provincial government and reported to the Ministry of Finance for record. In reviewing county taxes and county budgets, provincial governments should pay attention to the actual needs and the opinions of representative bodies, and should not excessively restrict the rational development of local county-level politics. However, arbitrary apportionment in various localities should be absolutely prohibited. Provincial governments should determine the steps for rectification and effectively implement them within one month of receiving this document, and report the progress of the rectification monthly for record.

III. Regarding reducing the concurrent posts of county magistrates: The county magistrate is an official close to the people, governing a territory of hundreds of miles, and is responsible for everything. All measures must be carefully considered and personally inspected. The complexity of the affairs and the magnitude of the responsibilities are vastly different from those of the heads of ordinary agencies. Unless we alleviate the burden of their side duties and focus their minds, enabling them to devote their full efforts, it will be difficult to fulfill their duties. Given the current situation, county magistrates hold numerous concurrent posts, and it is difficult to manage everything at once. Either they are spread too thin and become ineffective, or they are forced to prioritize secondary matters over primary ones. The poor state of county administration in recent years is also a major cause. Since the 29th year [1940], this Yuan has repeatedly issued circulars to adjust the situation, but a review of the concurrent posts of county magistrates still reveals as many as ten or more. If we do not clearly state the principles and supervise the effective simplification, how can we focus the responsibility of the county magistrate and promote the development of county administration? It is stipulated that if the posts that county magistrates are legally required to hold concurrently are, in fact, unnecessary, the relevant laws and regulations should be reviewed and fundamentally corrected. If the laws and regulations are issued by the central government, they should be reviewed and amended by the central competent ministries and commissions. If the laws and regulations are issued by the local government, they should be reviewed and amended by the provincial government. If the matters can be handled by the various departments and offices of the county government without the need to establish separate agencies, they should be abolished immediately. Only if the matters cannot be merged and the laws cannot be changed can the county magistrate be required to continue to hold them concurrently. This strict approach is only intended to reduce the number of concurrent posts, so that the county magistrate can focus on their primary duties, and the progress of local politics can be expected.

### No Orders to Be Issued to Counties Except by Designated Superiors

IV. Regarding restricting direct command of county magistrates: The county magistrate is responsible to the provincial government above and governs the townships below. All land, people, and affairs within the jurisdiction are under the control of the county magistrate alone. Their responsibility is heavy and their power should be exclusive. However, senior agencies or garrison commanders of other departments, in order to facilitate their own work, often entrust matters that are not within their jurisdiction to the county magistrate and directly issue orders to supervise them. This not only increases the burden but also undermines their authority. The National Government promulgated temporary measures for central agencies and troops to use documents and orders to county governments in February of the 31st year [1942] and issued circulars for implementation. The measures stipulated that except for (1) officers above the rank of general in the war zone or garrison area, regarding emergency situations in combat, (2) garrison commanders, martial law commanders, and pacification directors in the garrison area, martial law area, or pacification area, regarding garrison, martial law, and pacification military operations, and (3) provincial air defense commanders, regarding air defense emergencies, who may directly issue orders to the county governments within their respective areas, any other agency or troop that requires the county government to handle matters should have the provincial government forward the orders for compliance and should not directly issue orders. Those who arbitrarily issue orders to the county government will be dealt with separately by the competent higher-level agency. Although the central government's regulations are quite strict, the local implementation is not very effective. Those who are not in the direct command system still issue orders to the county magistrate, which is very common and must be corrected. Provincial governments are responsible for considering the situation of each county and district and listing the agencies that should be directly commanded, informing the relevant county governments and instructing each county government to immediately report to the provincial government any agency without direct command authority that arbitrarily issues orders to them, and the provincial government is responsible for forwarding the report to the competent higher-level agency for punishment. Only in this way will the county magistrate with heavy responsibilities not be unfairly oppressed, and only in this way will the agencies that arbitrarily issue orders have some scruples. The provincial government must take more responsibility for the implementation of central laws and regulations and the protection of the authority of the county magistrate. We hope that the provincial chairmen will strive to do so.

V. Regarding the selection and examination of county-level officials: Now that county-level institutions have been streamlined, finances have been rectified, and county magistrates are no longer holding multiple concurrent posts, it can be said that the objective conditions for work are largely in place. If we can obtain sound assistants to work together, the efficiency of county administration can be greatly improved. Looking at the current situation of county-level personnel, due to the low salaries and the lack of talent, people are often recruited locally to fill positions inadequately. Before appointment, there is no thorough selection and training. After appointment, there is no rigorous assessment of rewards and punishments. As a result, greedy and incompetent people can also embark on official careers, and corruption and bribery become commonplace. After this streamlining of institutions and rectification of finances, the number of personnel will be reduced, making it easier to recruit talent. With sufficient funds, it will be easier to promote integrity. Provincial governments should immediately supervise and instruct each county magistrate to take advantage of this opportunity for reform to effectively streamline their subordinates, reward integrity and punish corruption, and remove the inferior and retain the superior. In the future, the selection, training, assessment, reward, and punishment of county-level officials should be strictly handled in accordance with the law, so that greedy and incompetent people are eliminated from public service, and those who are both moral and competent are given official positions. Only then will it be easier to obtain talented people for governance and achieve results, and only then will it be possible to transform social customs and renew local politics.

The situation is difficult, and local difficulties are even greater. The people are eagerly awaiting good governance, and the nation is about to implement constitutional government. All matters that should be promoted and reformed must be done promptly and without delay. The five points listed above are the basic conditions for improving county administration. Otherwise, with exhausted funds and bloated staff, with heavy tasks and divided powers, how can we expect achievements and even talk about construction? We hope that the provincial governments will truly understand this, and the county governments will deeply reflect on it. The central ministries and commissions should also understand the principle of internal and external cooperation and the unity of the upper and lower levels, and assist the development of local politics to the extent permitted by laws and regulations. We must ensure that all that is covered by this order can be quickly and thoroughly implemented. The benefits to the future of the nation will be immeasurable. In addition to issuing separate orders, this urgent order is issued for compliance.

### Supervisory Committee Members Li Shijun and Others Inspect the Resources Commission

Weng Wenhao Explains the Situation of Governance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Supervisory Committee members Li Shijun, Zhang Lu, Yang Naixuan, and others visited the Resources Commission at 10:00 AM on the 25th to inspect the situation of governance. They were first received by the Chairman of the Commission, Weng Wenhao, who gave a general explanation of the organization of the Commission and the overview of the facilities of its affiliated enterprises. Then, the Chief Secretary of the Commission, Wu Zhaohong, together with the heads of various departments, reported on the current situation of various undertakings. Subsequently, Committee Member Li and others raised several questions, including (1) the situation of the Soviet Union dismantling industrial and mining equipment in the Northeast, (2) the situation of the communist bandits destroying industrial and mining equipment, and (3) the actual situation of the enterprises designated by the Executive Yuan to be sold to private ownership by the Resources Commission. Wu gave detailed answers and provided written materials to Committee Member Li and others.

### Cause of Missing Airliner Possibly Due to Weather Conditions: Air Force Headquarters Releases Search Process

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Air Transport Brigade C-47, No. 257, Landi airliner, flew out of Dihua on July 30th and arrived safely in Hami on the same day. The next day, it went missing en route to Jiayuguan, and its whereabouts are still unknown. The Air Force Headquarters has released the search process and the list of personnel on board as follows:

Missing Incident: C-47, No. 257, carrying 21 passengers, took off from Dihua at 9:11 AM on July 30th and arrived safely in Hami at 11:30 AM on the same day. It then took off from Hami at 2:50 PM on July 31st to Jiayuguan. After takeoff, the aircraft maintained contact with the Air Force Jiayuguan radio station, and the communication was very good. At 4:50 PM, the communication suddenly broke off, and the Air Force Hami, Jiayuguan, and Lanzhou radio stations called for a long time. At 6:40 PM, the aircraft was still missing.

Possible Cause of Missing: On that day, the weather in Hami, Anxi, Jiayuguan, Zhangye, and Lanzhou suddenly turned bad after 4:00 PM. The cloud height dropped to below 1,000 feet, the visibility was within one mile, and it was snowing. The cause of the aircraft's disappearance may be due to the influence of the temperature airflow formed by the sudden change in local weather at the junction of the desert and mountainous areas, causing the aircraft to lose control and crash. Other possible causes, such as a sudden malfunction of the aircraft's parts, could also cause the aircraft to lose control. However, the exact cause cannot be determined until the wreckage of the aircraft is found.

Search and Rescue Details: After the aircraft was declared missing, the Air Force Jiayuguan station notified the Lanzhou Commissioner's Office and the local garrison commander, asking them to forward the message to the county, township, and Baojia [local administrative units] and the local garrison to mobilize and search for the aircraft. Based on the information obtained from various sources, the areas where the accident may have occurred were systematically searched. After three weeks of continuous efforts in the air and on the ground, there were still no results. In addition to continuing the search in the air and on the ground, the Headquarters will first announce the details of the incident and the list of personnel on board: (1) List of crew members: Pilot Liu Yilu, Co-pilot Zhao Haiquan, Communicator Deng Yougen, Mechanic Xu Huixun. (2) Passenger list: Kong Xianhui, Section Chief of the 16th Air Force Station, and his wife Li Jingzhen, and one child, Air Force Future Warrior Li Zengyu, Yanci Radio Station Chief Li Liangde, Sergeants Zhao Liancheng, Wang Desheng, Kou Guanying, Foreman Zhang Mengchu, Air Force Special Company Commander Shi Xuemeng, Air Force Special Company Adjutant Chen Lixiang, Sergeant Liu Weixian, Wen Shunan (female), family member of the 9th Branch School Training Class, Qiu Zhili of the Garrison Headquarters, Han Heran, Xie Yongcun, Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Department, Lei Yingyi of the Tenth Regiment of the China Training Corps, Wen Youlan (female), student of Tianshan Normal School, Lu Chenying, staff member of the Women's Education Department of Tianshan Normal School, Reporter Sha Linxin, American reporter Stephen (female).

### Personnel Changes in the Northeast To Be Officially Announced Soon

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Today, the reporter specifically interviewed the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense regarding the reorganization of the Northeast Headquarters and the transfer of senior generals in that area to inquire about the details. According to the spokesperson, the reorganization of the Northeast Headquarters is indeed a fact, but the personnel transfer will be officially announced by the government soon. The various rumors circulating outside are purely speculative and do not correspond to the facts.

### The Hebei, Ping, and Tianjin Workers' Association Sends Another Telegram to the Central Government To Prevent the Smuggling and Dumping of Japanese Goods and That The Dismantling of Japanese Industrial Equipment Must Not Be Delayed

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 25th] Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Hebei, Ping, and Tianjin Workers' Association, sent another telegram on the 23rd regarding the issue of opening trade with Japan to the Chairman and the heads of various Yuan and ministries of the central government, stating that recently, smuggled Japanese goods have been found in large quantities on the market. The resurgence of aggression has already begun with its vanguard. The Japanese are acting unscrupulously, and the Eastern barbarians are engaging in many tricks. Once trade with Japan is officially opened, the trend of smuggling and dumping will inevitably become even more rampant than before the war, and it will be impossible to prevent. We must not ignore this, and dismantling their textile industrial equipment is a fundamental solution that should not be tolerated or delayed. As for their chemical industry, the main target should be the soda ash manufacturing industry. Currently, Japan's equipment has a large surplus beyond maintaining its production level before 1935. Moreover, Japan's raw materials for alkali production, salt, must be supplied by our country. However, our salt industry has been devastated by their destruction during the occupation, and production has sharply declined. From the standpoint of establishing China's basic chemical industry, we have the right to demand the dismantling of Japanese salt factories as compensation for the losses of our salt industry. Furthermore, Japanese rayon factories were absolutely necessary military industries during the war and should originally be on the list of prohibitions. Even in terms of burnt salt, the main chemical used in Japanese rayon production, its production volume should be limited according to the level before 1935, so the equipment of its rayon factories must also be largely abandoned. China needs rayon, but domestic supply is lacking. The existing Japanese rayon factories should also be dismantled and moved to China, so that our supply and demand can be balanced.

### Scope of Authority of Military Police and Police Has Been Drafted by the Ministry of Interior

To Be Promulgated After Approval by the Executive Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the measures for adjusting the authority of military police and police, according to reporter investigations, the existing laws and regulations will be reiterated, and the scope of authority of military police and police will be clearly defined. The main points are as follows: The police will be fully responsible for handling general public security issues, and the military police must not overstep their authority. Military police should carry out punishments for violations of public security by military personnel, and the police must not interfere. If the military police investigate general public security order and need to handle it, they should immediately notify the local police to carry out the punishment, and the military police must not overstep their authority. Conversely, if the police discover that military personnel are violating public security order, they should immediately request the local military police to enforce the law, and the police must not interfere. If there are no military police stationed in the area, the police may act on behalf of the military police. In areas where no police have been set up, the military police may also act on behalf of the police. The above measures have been drafted by the competent authorities of the Ministry of Interior and will be jointly signed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before being promulgated.

### Third Batch of Allocated Warships Leaves Japan for Qingdao for Transfer

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The third batch of allocated warships, 33 ships, has been concentrated in Sasebo. On the 25th, nine ships, including the Kasuga, were dispatched to the Soviet Union to Sakhalin Island, and nine ships, including the New Moon, were dispatched to Qingdao for China.

### Wei Envoy Flies to Korea Today for Inspection That the Mission Had Gathered at MacArthur's Headquarters and Wei Has Obtained an Outline of the Situation in Korea

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] U.S. President's Special Envoy General Wedemeyer and members of his fact-finding mission began collecting information on South Korea from MacArthur's headquarters on the 25th. The working methods of the mission in Tokyo are the same as in China. At noon on the 25th, Wei had lunch with Lieutenant General Eichelberger, Commander of the Eighth Army, in Yokohama, and had dinner with MacArthur in the evening, accompanied by his liaison advisor Watson. Wei will fly to Seoul at 9:30 AM on the 26th. It is reported that Wei has obtained the issues of the Korean occupation area, and has also obtained an image of the opinions of the Allied Headquarters on the broad political situation in the Far East.

Wei's experts met with headquarters officials to discuss the military, political, and economic problems of South Korea. South Korea is under MacArthur's command, and Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea, recently condemned the Soviet Union's representatives in the U.S. and Soviet Joint Commission for encouraging North Korean politicians to promote illegal activities in the U.S. occupied areas. After inspecting South Korea for eight or ten days, Wei will travel to Hawaii via Tokyo, where he will merge the Chinese and Korean reports into one and make recommendations to President Truman.

Wu Tiecheng Discusses Wei's Statement Believes It is Constructive Criticism

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Wu Tiecheng, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan and Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, told a United Press reporter on the 25th: "Special Envoy Wei's farewell message is of great value to us, because from this, we can use other people's observations of us as a mirror." Wu continued, "We accept the spirit of Wei's criticism and recognize this as constructive criticism from a well-intentioned friend. We will do our best to remedy our shortcomings. However, the problem of the Chinese Communists is a major factor hindering the National Government from implementing reforms and construction. We certainly pray that the Chinese Communists will lay down their arms and cooperate for the benefit of the people, but our experience shows that the possibility of this hope being realized is very small. Communist ideology is a malignant tumor that cannot be cured without excision. The Chinese government has a responsibility to the people to quell the communist rebellion, so that our people can enjoy peace and the construction of the country can proceed smoothly. We do not use the communist crisis as an excuse not to improve ourselves, but the war against the communists is a great burden on our country's devastated vitality. The sooner the communist rebellion is quelled, the faster China's recovery will be."

[United Press, Moscow, 25th] The Communist Party's "Pravda" newspaper stated today that the United States has repeatedly sent presidential special envoys to China, usually limited to military leaders, which is well known. The real goal of the Wedemeyer mission is definitely not purely fact-finding.

### Reporting Corruption

Executive Yuan Circulars to All Provinces and Cities

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan recently, in order to rectify the customs of various localities and eradicate corruption, recently issued circulars to the governments of various provinces and cities, encouraging the reporting of corruption and rewarding informants. The names of informants will be kept as confidential as possible in order to thoroughly eradicate corruption.

### Mongolian Troops Invade Beitashan Again Launching a "Cattle Charge" Assault Repelled by Our Forces

[Central News Agency Correspondent Stationed in Qitai, Urgent Telegram from Beitashan, 24th] (Delayed) Last night, a team of Mongolian troops of about fifty people launched an attack on our Huzhierte outpost at the northern foot of Beitashan in a mix of rain, snow, and hail. The Mongolian troops fought like a "cattle charge," swarming forward. When the hail was at its fiercest, the gunfire was also at its densest. The attacking Mongolian troops were suppressed by our army's firepower. In recent days, the Mongolian army's rear has been very active. Every day, five or six trucks transport troops to the front line, as preparation for a major battle. At 9:00 PM on the 23rd, more than 30 Mongolian troops also took advantage of the thick fog to attack the Usman troops and were repelled. It is generally judged that the Mongolian troops seem to be probing our main force in order to launch a large-scale attack.

### Vice Chairman Sun Arrives in Guangzhou, All Circles to Hold Welcome Meeting This Morning

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] Vice Chairman Sun arrived in Guangzhou from Macau aboard the Yongxing warship on the morning of the 25th. He landed at Shamian at 4 PM. The entire city and county were decorated with flags and celebratory arches to welcome him, creating a warm atmosphere. A welcome meeting by all circles is scheduled to be held at 10 AM on the 26th at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. The city government had originally planned to rename the section from Huangsha to Dongdi as "Yat-sen Road," and a naming ceremony was scheduled for the 25th. However, due to insufficient preparation, it was postponed, as Vice Chairman Sun was the first mayor of Guangzhou. Furthermore, according to a report from Zhongshan: Vice Chairman Sun made remarks in Shiqi, stating: There are many misinterpretations regarding the Wei envoy's visit to China. He has never heard the Wei envoy criticize the Chinese government. He believes that after the Wei envoy returns to the United States, they will be able to help China. We should not harbor fear. Although the United States is currently a world power, a democratic country should respect public opinion. Therefore, the United States has no ambition to seize territory or resources, or to enslave the people of China, nor does it have such ambitions towards the world. We should seize the opportunity while the United States has a strong industrial power to welcome them to assist in our country's post-war reconstruction.

### Legend of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway

— Bu Shaofu

Southward Travels: Random Notes, Part Two

This is one of the miracles in the history of Chinese railways.

From Guangzhou to Kowloon, the total length is 178.55 kilometers. However, the 35.78 kilometers from Kowloon to Shenzhen belong to the British section. In other words, the remaining 142.77 kilometers are the Chinese section, under our country's jurisdiction. Before the War of Resistance and until its victory, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was an independent unit. After the victory, the national railway system was divided into districts for management. For example, the Nanxun Railway was merged into the Zhegan District, the Huhang Railway was merged into the Jinghu District, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways were also merged into the Yuehan District.

I once asked Mr. Du Zhenyuan, the Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, and learned that the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway accounts for about 40% of the monthly passenger and freight revenue of the Yuehan District. The Yuehan Railway, from Wuchang to Guangzhou, is 1,080 kilometers long, nearly seven times the length of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The route distance ratio of seven to one, and the passenger and freight revenue ratio of six to four, the main reason, apart from traffic conditions, is the overseas outlet in Kowloon.

If everyone remembers, during the War of Resistance, before the fall of Guangzhou, we used the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for transportation in a state of constantly begging. Today, things have changed, and cooperation has restarted. However, the pain and troubles of those involved are beyond the imagination of outsiders.

Let me give you a recent example:

At 3:30 PM on August 15th, a tragic train collision occurred at Buji Station, resulting in the immediate deaths of two stokers and two passengers. Three passengers were seriously injured and three were slightly injured. The cause of the accident was that a special train fully loaded with railway equipment from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, upon reaching a point 138.5 kilometers from Guangzhou, suddenly had its last three carriages' couplings break, causing them to roll backwards towards Buji Station and violently collide with freight train No. 96 from Guangzhou to Shenzhen, which was stopped at the station. This caused the locomotive and carriages two, three, four, and five of train No. 96 to derail simultaneously.

After the incident, the Yuehan Railway Bureau issued a statement claiming that the train originated from the British section, and the drivers and stokers were all dispatched by the British section, so they believed that the British section should be responsible for the accident. The British section stated that the accident location was in the Chinese section, and the train was allocated by the Transportation Administration. The couplings had different structures, leading to the uncoupling incident, so the British section could not be responsible. The two sides are passing blame onto each other. Who is ultimately responsible? A conclusion has not yet been reached.

From this recent example, it is not difficult to see the strange evolution of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, where unification has not been achieved and each section governs itself. Who can say that future tragedies will not occur again?

In the autumn of 1938, I traveled from Hong Kong to Hankou via the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Yuehan Railways. Nine years have passed, and there have been no special changes along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. However, the scenery on the Guangzhou-Kowloon train is very different from what it was nine years ago.

The scenery on the train is exactly the same as what I saw on the Jinghu Line just after the victory in September 1945. A large number of small-scale traders and smugglers packed every carriage. Each time the train arrived in Guangzhou or Kowloon, these "light cavalry" rushed to the exit in a blitz-like manner. The situation seemed even more tense than escaping during an air raid alarm.

Smuggling on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has the spirit of Liangshan Marsh. Many retired soldiers rely on this route to support their families. They often carry dozens of cartons of cigarettes or a few pieces of clothing, which they bring from Kowloon and sell in Guangzhou, earning tens or hundreds of thousands of yuan each trip. They are very generous and straightforward. When they encounter customs officers, they will frankly say:

"Friend, I fought for eight years and have nothing left, only this treasure," saying this they would take down the pistol from his waist and wave it at the customs officers. Again using the pistol, they would point to the package in front of them saying:

"There is no other way, I rely on this to make a living."

Naturally, most of these heroes board the train midway and get off at the station before reaching their destination, taking small paths and shortcuts to evade customs and taxes. However, those who rely on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for smuggling to support their families are small-time smugglers between Hong Kong and Guangdong. They are merely fighting alone to make a living. Compared to large-scale organized smuggling by waterway, they are insignificant.

Because of the exposure of the secret compartments on the Foshan steamship, people have spread rumors that there are also places for hiding smuggled goods in the Guangzhou-Kowloon locomotives (i.e., train engines). Ordinary people often say that they are unfamiliar with the structure and parts of the locomotive, and the coal bunker, water tank, and engine are not easily noticed. The connections and gaps are even more incomprehensible to outsiders. Therefore, they become the safest places to hide goods. Where there is profit, especially in such an environment, it is difficult for us to believe that this rumor has no truth to it. Naturally, so far, there have been no accidents involving the locomotive. Let's hope this rumor is just a rumor.

The floods in the Dongguan area are frightening. Looking out the train window, it feels like sailing in a river. In many places, the water is level with the railway bed. At each small station, the sounds of men, women, and children selling longan, eggs, large candied fruits, and preserved meat rice are deafening. The noise is not only greater than that on the Jinghu Line, but also incomparable to the Yuehan Line. It tells me that this is the scenery of a disaster area, this is the urgent struggle for survival.

My traveling companion, Mr. S, pointed to a wisp of smoke rising in the distance outside the window and said to me:

"I am most afraid of seeing the smoke rising from the countryside in the evening. It reminds me of home."

I said:

"Your hometown is probably not much different from here now."

The Way Of Blood Or Gold. A foreign female colleague once used this phrase to refer to the Burma Road. Sitting in a Guangzhou-Kowloon train carriage, I suddenly thought of her name.

### Tsaldaris Makes Renewed Efforts, New Greek Cabinet May Be Formed Today, US Hopes Liberal Party Will Join Cooperation

[Our Newspaper] London, 25th (Xinhua News Agency dispatch): After renewed consultations with leaders of various parties, Tsaldaris hopes to submit the list of proposed cabinet members to the King at 7 PM today. It is also learned that Tsaldaris had a meeting with US Ambassador MacVeagh to explore the US's opinions on the formation of a cabinet.

[Our Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: Tsaldaris issued a statement saying that he hopes to form a new Greek cabinet as soon as possible, adopting the broadest possible coalition system to replace the overthrown cabinet. The US Embassy signaled to Liberal Party leader Sophoulis, hoping that the Liberal Party would participate in the new government and suggested that Sophoulis propose a counter-proposal to the "joint command" proposal put forward by the People's Party. Sophoulis's reply to Tsaldaris was not made public, but according to an official, Sophoulis said that if the People's Party's policies fail, the Liberal Party will govern alone.

[Reuters, Athens, 25th] The People's Party leader Tsaldaris, who was ordered to form a cabinet, began visiting leaders of various parties today and visited former Prime Minister Sophoulis, the leader of the Liberal Party. US diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the development of the Greek political situation. US Ambassador MacVeagh entered the palace last night to meet King Paul. Afterwards, MacVeagh said, "We hope to have a Greek government with a more free foundation. The United Kingdom and the United States are here to guide and offer opinions and are not interested in political parties and individuals."

[United Press, Athens, 24th] Police, military police, and the army in Athens have taken precautions to prevent any possible riots. Regarding the formation of a cabinet, some observers believe that based on the emergency statement made by Defense Minister Veni-zelos on the 23rd, "If General Zervas clings to his post, the United States will inevitably stop supplying the Greek government with weapons and equipment to suppress the guerrillas." It is highly likely that General Zervas will not participate in the new cabinet. Some qualified observers believe that if Zervas withdraws from the cabinet, relations between the Greek government and the guerrillas may improve.

### US Emergency Military Supplies Shipped to Greece by Sea in a Steady Stream, US Officials Issue Broadcast Reviewing Aid to Greece Plan

[US Information Service, Washington, 24th] The US State Department recently announced that in order to step up aid to Greece, the United States has shipped 50,000 long tons of emergency military supplies to Greece by sea. At the same time, the US Navy will transfer six 176-foot-long patrol boats to the Greek government. Greek sailors for these patrol boats will arrive in the United States this month to receive rigorous training. In addition, the US will transfer a large number of minesweeper parts to the Greek Navy. Since Greece has suffered severe railway damage, it relies entirely on marine navigation for transportation, so minesweeping is extremely important.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 25th] Soviet Representative Shtykov of the US-Soviet Joint Commission received reporters at Deoksu Palace today and issued Foreign Minister Molotov's reply to Secretary of State Marshall, stating that the Soviet side believes that parties or groups with only 20 or 30 members cannot represent public opinion. Therefore, the Soviet side still insists that only those with more than 10,000 members are qualified to be consulted.

He also said that the current arrest of democratic elements in South Korea by the US military authorities is hindering the development of democratization in Korea, and the Soviet representative cannot help but express his opinion.

### Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe Not Limited to Western Europe, Also Related to the Far East and Other Regions

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Government economists on the 24th observed that once the Marshall Plan is implemented, it will involve more countries in addition to Western European countries. They believe that countries in the Far East, South America, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand will directly or indirectly participate in the work of the Marshall Plan. Due to this, these economists do not overemphasize the general pessimistic view of Western Europe's future food supply. They acknowledge that the current food outlook is not bright, but they are not worried about the general impression that Western Europe will not be able to feed itself within a few years. Their reasons are:

Western Europe's Difficulties Are Not Serious

(1) Western Europe's power to develop agricultural production is greater than generally believed. (2) The "Iron Curtain" between Eastern and Western Europe cannot prevent Western European industrialized countries from producing products that Eastern European agricultural countries urgently need. Therefore, the exchange of food products can be developed, which can greatly reduce the scarcity of countries lacking agricultural products. They believe that the mismatch between Western Europe's products and needs is not as great as expected. If Western Europe can easily obtain what it needs from all over the world with its products, coupled with US aid, all problems will be solved.

### US Wants to Make Pan-American Mutual Defense Treaty Communist-Proof, Pan-American Conference Progressing Smoothly

In addition, an agreement has not yet been reached on Argentina's request for consensus before joint action.

### Implementing Restrictions on Converting Pounds into Dollars, British Cabinet Discusses Economic Decisions, Eady to Report on Anglo-American Financial Conference

[Our Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: The British Cabinet held an emergency meeting on the 25th to discuss the issue of a possible 50% to 75% reduction in US food imports, as well as the accompanying issue of reducing domestic food rations.

[United Press, London, 25th] The British Cabinet is scheduled to meet today, presided over by Prime Minister Attlee, to discuss the impact of restrictions on converting pounds into dollars. In addition, the coal production problem may also be discussed.

[Reuters, London, 25th] When the British Cabinet meets today, there will be three major issues to be decided: (1) The new food rations that the British people should receive after reducing food imports from the dollar zone; (2) Revising the import plans for non-dollar countries in the Eastern Hemisphere, which now all need pounds since the United Kingdom has regained control of the pound; (3) Estimating the amount of supplies that the Commonwealth countries can provide to the United Kingdom from the United States. Although the decision on these three major issues requires the same period of research, a temporary decision on the amount of food rations for the British people can be made within a week. The Cabinet will also listen to Eady's report on attending the Washington financial conference. Eady is expected to arrive in London at 12:30 today. It is said that Eady will soon return to Washington. The main unresolved issue of the Washington Anglo-American financial talks is that the United States insists that Article 9 of the Anglo-American loan agreement, which prohibits discrimination, must remain in effect until it is deleted by Congress with a special bill. However, a compromise agreement has now been reached in which the United States "informally" recognizes that the United Kingdom cannot comply with that clause. According to British financial experts, this compromise agreement merely recognizes the inevitable facts in the current situation. The United Kingdom is now turning to its Commonwealth countries and European countries to seek closer economic cooperation.

Edison said that Britain wants to protect its interests in the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places, and wants to develop the resources in these areas. When a reporter specifically asked about the status of Hong Kong, Edison replied: This matter depends on the final decision, but he emphasized that Britain has no intention of abandoning its vested interests in any place. Someone asked whether the Japanese peace treaty would be drafted only by the four powers or by all relevant countries. McNeil replied: Drafting the peace treaty is the work of the major powers that actually directly participated in the war, but another agency will be established for other relevant countries to participate. Mr. McNeil said that Britain will support Australia's opposition to the use of the veto power at the Pacific peace conference. Regarding the issue of Japan's post-war territory, Mr. McNeil replied that this matter has been agreed upon at repeated international conferences, and Japan's territory is limited to the four main islands and some small islands. When a reporter asked whether Britain supports the US proposal at the Pacific peace conference that a two-thirds majority can pass, Mr. Edison said he did not want to discuss this issue at this stage. It is expected that this issue will be raised for discussion at the Canberra conference. Regarding the issue of Japanese compensation, Mr. Edison said that Britain will do its best to support reasonable compensation requirements, but does not want to see impoverished Japanese people rely on others for survival. Mr. McNeil said that the agency that supervises the implementation of the Japanese peace treaty "should be retained when necessary." He emphasized that security should be the primary consideration.

### Mobile Hospital Drives into the Countryside to Provide Services: The Culmination of the Efforts of Gongji Hospital, with Perfect Equipment; The Farmers Seeking Treatment Crowded in Yuqing, Dachang

A five-ton Dodge truck, after nearly a year of continuous assembly and transformation, consuming the designer's endless efforts, has been completed as a mobile hospital dedicated to serving the countryside. On a hot morning—August 17th—it secretly slipped out of the gate of Gongji Hospital, leaving the bustling city and heading straight to the countryside. The two directors who initiated and designed and built this mobile hospital—Dr. Zhu Yanggao and Dr. Ding Mingquan—led more than 20 staff members, including the attending physicians of internal medicine, surgery, and obstetrics, X-ray physicians, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, administrative directors, registrars, and workers, who all sat quietly in the car.

The mobile hospital issued an emergency whistle, opened full speed, and rushed out of the noisy and dull city center. The staff in the car also hoped to arrive at their destination early—Yuqing Bridge, Dachang.

Complete Equipment for Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics, and Laboratory Testing

The scenery along the way was ordinary and not worth browsing. The reporter's mind could not help but turn to this mobile hospital. The reporter had seen many ambulances before, which were pitiful, and most of them were simply equipped. Looking at this mobile hospital, it has everything that it should have, and it deserves to be called a "hospital." It can be said to be unique in the country. It is equipped with a generator, X-ray fluoroscopy and photography equipment. The laboratory department includes microscopes and common clinical laboratory supplies and equipment. In terms of internal medicine, there is a medicine box full of various commonly used medicines and dispensing tools; in terms of surgery and obstetrics, there is a complete set of equipment that can perform major operations. In addition, the equipment includes two soft beds that can bring patients back, a large water tank with a capacity of 80 gallons, a large tent that can hold two operating tables, as well as dozens of wooden sticks attached to the tent, and a number of tennis nets surrounding the tent to prevent outsiders from approaching the tent. Each department of internal medicine has a consultation box, prepared to walk to visit seriously ill patients in places where cars cannot reach. In addition, there are dozens of pounds of alcohol, dozens of pounds of distilled water. After calculating, these equipments are enough to fill a car, but the designers cleverly used the gaps under the car walls, car bottom, and seats, so the car can still seat more than ten people.

Quickly Set Up Tents Amidst Broken Walls

At this moment, the car stopped. The car stopped at the entrance of the former site of the China Children's Health Institute. All the people rushed down and immediately started to arrange after slightly surveying the address in the broken walls. The teachers and students of Yucai School were very enthusiastic and willing to help them, but they politely declined because they wanted to use their own manpower and equipment to calculate the time required to set up the complete set of equipment. Without distinguishing, they worked quickly and actually set up the tent in half an hour. The tennis net was surrounded on the outside, and the registration office began to register. The generator was already running, the lights in the tent were on, the water on the electric stove was boiling, and the typhoid and cholera vaccinations began. More and more people were registering, but they still maintained a fairly good order. The internist picked up the stethoscope, the pharmacist was dispensing medicine, the surgeon was examining the wound, the patients who needed to be tested were already waiting for the report at the laboratory, the X-ray machine was emitting light, and the X-ray physician was hiding in the airless car, sweating profusely. The two directors patrolled everywhere, and at any time wrote down the items that needed to be added or reformed. The reporter came for sightseeing, but was attracted by their tense and excited working conditions, and could not help but also participate in their work and do some obligations.

A patient in the mobile hospital registers, sees a doctor, takes medicine, and adds various examinations, and at most, they don't have to wait for a lens, which is incomparable to going to a big hospital in the city, where you have to wait for half a day.

Strong Women in the Field Undergoing Surgery on the Spot

I was idly watching in the internal medicine outpatient department when I suddenly heard Director Zhu, who was standing in the operating room, shouting:

"Mr. Wu, would you like to come and see?"

A woman in her thirties was preparing to lie on the operating table. Two surgeons pointed out to me that this rural woman was burned on her neck when she was five years old, leaving a big scar on her neck after healing, so that her head was always tilted to the left and could not turn to the right. For decades, she has lived this kind of life. Now, she wants to use plastic surgery to correct it, and after a while, she will be able to turn her head to the right.

The operation began. There was a fluorescent light on the top of the tent. The operating table was in the center, and the operating table and operating lamp were next to it. Behind the surgeons, there was an electric fan each. The nurses and workers were constantly spraying DDT around the outside of the tent to prevent mosquitoes and flies from flying into the tent. The operation was completed soon, and the patient stood up, shook her head to the right, and thanked the two doctors. A worker serving in the mobile hospital, watching her back, said to himself: "The rich people in Shanghai don't have the good fortune of having surgery delivered to their door!"

After a camp-style lunch, work began again. At 4 p.m., this group of staff members packed everything up and planned to go back. The surrounding farmers and students asked: "When will you come again?"

### Suddenly Carrying a Patient with Appendicitis

The car drove to the Dachang Town People's Education Center and stopped to work for another two hours. Just as the car was about to drive back two hours later, a villager ran from several miles away, saying that there was a patient at home who seemed to have appendicitis and wanted to ask the doctor from the mobile hospital to take a look. Upon hearing the news, the surgeon ran off. An hour later, a female patient with suppurated appendicitis was sent to the bed on the mobile hospital's stretcher. Five minutes before the car was about to start, there were still a few villagers who rushed several miles to see a doctor, but unfortunately it was too late, everything had been put away, and the car had already started, so they could only comfort them to come again next time.

On the way back to Gongji Hospital, the reporter asked Mr. Chen, who was in charge of registration, how many outpatients there were today. She took out a list from the box and showed it to me. It was written on it: 91 internal medicine outpatients, 85 surgical outpatients, 5 gynecology outpatients, and 88 typhoid and cholera vaccinations.

More than 20 staff members were busy all day, but their spirits were still full. Director Zhu was smoking a cigarette and leaning on the back of his chair, contemplating.

Digging Holes in the Wooden Gate: Patients Pay What They Can Afford

"Director Zhu, although your hospital's work is a practice, your staff's spirit is too good, and the work is too meaningful!" the reporter said to him.

"I don't dare to say that. After this performance, I found that there are still many places that need to be improved. What I want to develop is the rural anti-tuberculosis campaign and the trachoma prevention and treatment campaign. A projector to promote common sense of hygiene and epidemic prevention is in the plan. I originally planned to install a short-wave walkie-talkie in the car so that I could contact the hospital anytime and anywhere, but the Ministry of Communications did not allow this, so I am afraid there is no hope, which is very regrettable. I plan to build a few more cars in the future, and it will not be as difficult as this time, because this time it was changed again and again! I will go to Dachang again next Saturday. I may have to go to Nanjing at the beginning of next month. I hope everyone will come to study improvement methods, and I hope everyone will promote it so that more mobile hospitals can go to the countryside."

"I am very willing to be a volunteer promoter of mobile hospitals. I have one more question, how come I didn't see you charge patients?"

"Haha! We want to give the best things to the countryside. We don't plan to charge farmers too much. Our method of charging is also a bit special," he said, pointing his finger at a wooden box with a hole dug in it. Patients put some money in it at will, and it is okay if they don't pay. We are imitating Shanghai's Zhang Zhengqi's method, which is the most appropriate method for the poor. We adopted it today."

"Today, we probably didn't receive tens of thousands of dollars in total," the registrar reported, shaking the wooden box with her hand. (Special Correspondent)

### Automobile Permits for Gasoline Purchases to be Implemented September 1st

[Report from this Newspaper] The regulations for automobile gasoline purchases using permits in this city have been approved by the City Government Economic Inspection Meeting yesterday. The main points are as follows: (1) All civilian and public automobiles with Shanghai and national license plates that have paid the second half of the year 36 tax, and automobiles with national license plates from other cities that have been registered with the Public Utilities Bureau, can obtain automobile gasoline purchase permits free of charge from the Fourth Division of the Public Utilities Bureau by presenting their driver's license from today. Starting September 1st, they can purchase gasoline from any gas station in the city with the permit. Gas stations will refuse to supply gasoline to those who have not obtained gasoline purchase permits. (2) Gasoline purchases with permits must be directly poured into the automobile's fuel tank. The gas station attendant will fill in the amount of gasoline sold and the date on the gasoline purchase permit and stamp it as proof. (3) If an automobile runs out of gasoline on the road and cannot reach a gas station, the nearby gas station may sell emergency gasoline with the car's gasoline purchase permit, limited to one gallon. The car owner must provide their own can, and the procedure in point 2 should be followed for recording. (4) If car dealerships, long-distance bus companies, or organizations with their own gas stations still need to purchase gasoline from gas stations for their vehicles, they must still follow the procedures and obtain automobile gasoline purchase permits. (5) After the gasoline purchase permit for this month is used up, a new permit for the next month will be issued in exchange for the old permit. If any improper use of gasoline by the vehicle is discovered, a new permit will not be issued. (6) The use of gasoline by military vehicles is not within the scope of supply in this city. Before a compensation method is negotiated with the Central Government, if military vehicles need to purchase gasoline from gas stations due to running out of gasoline on the road, regardless of the size of the vehicle, they are temporarily allowed to purchase two gallons of emergency gasoline each time. The gas station attendant will record this information themselves and report it directly to the oil company.

### Four Young Women Fall into a Trap Seeking a Livelihood, Unable to Return Home, Forced into Prostitution, Headhunter Shop Owner's Wife Traffics Humans

[Report from this Newspaper] The Changshu Road Police Precinct recently uncovered a case of human trafficking and forcing women into prostitution. It began with four women from Guixian, Xiang Juan (20 years old), Mai Cuizhen (26 years old), Wang Yuqin (21 years old), and Zhu Cuiqin (16 years old), who, due to poverty, went from their village to the county town to work as maids. They met Cui Zhi, the owner's wife of a headhunter shop in the town. Recently, Cui Zhi falsely claimed that a wool factory in Shanghai was recruiting female workers with a monthly salary of hundreds of thousands. The four women quit their jobs in the countryside and came to Shanghai with Cui Zhi on the 18th of this month. They were directly sent to Yang Biao's place at 26 North Zhaojia Zhai, Xietu Road, with the understanding that Yang would take care of everything and introduce them to work, and Cui Zhi would return to her hometown first.

A few days later, Yang claimed that he could not find work and asked them to return home and wait for news. The four women, finding it difficult to travel and lacking funds to return, asked Yang to find a solution. Unexpectedly, Yang said that they could stay in Shanghai, but they would have to make a living by prostituting themselves. Forced by circumstances, the four women, starting from the 20th, were taken to small inns in the South Tibet Road area by Yang's wife, Li Cuizhen, and his sister, Yang Fenghua, to solicit business every day at 5 PM. On that day, in one night until 12 PM, the four of them had received as many as eleven customers, suffering greatly, and all the money they earned was taken away by Yang. Qiu Xiangjuan, being more alert, took the opportunity to escape and reported to the Changshu Police Station. The police were dispatched to arrest Yang and his wife and sister, as well as the other three women, and brought them to the police station. Yang admitted to trafficking women and forcing them into prostitution, saying that he had asked Qiu Cuizhi to find four women because he could not make a living, paying a price of 200,000 yuan per person, totaling 800,000 yuan. Based on the confession, the police station transferred Yang and others to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning. The four women, Qiu and the others, were temporarily placed under the care of the First Security Section of the precinct. Cheng Fang and Zhang Jinsheng, for professional negligence causing death, were sentenced to one year and four months imprisonment and eight months imprisonment respectively. The civil suit part was transferred to the Civil Court for handling. The reasons for Cheng Fang's verdict: (1) The Zhijiang ship's navigation line error caused the collision. (2) The ship was supposed to carry 357 passengers, but it carried over a thousand passengers at the time of the accident. The reasons for Zhang Jinsheng's verdict: (1) According to maritime law, barges should be placed behind the ship, but the Huatong ship placed the barges on both sides, hindering navigation. (2) Before the collision of the two ships, the Zhijiang ship sounded its whistle twice, but the Huatong ship ignored it, so the Huatong ship should also be held responsible for the collision.

### Zhijiang and Huatong Collision Case, Two Ship Captains Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Report from this Newspaper] The Zhijiang ship of the Tongji Shipping Company and the Huatong ship of the Gongyi Shiye Shipping Company collided outside the Wusongkou on the night of January 17th of this year. As a result, the Zhijiang ship sank, and many passengers drowned. Afterwards, the captain of the Zhijiang ship, Cheng Fang, and the captain of the Huatong ship, Zhang Jinsheng, were both prosecuted by the prosecutor for the crime of manslaughter. The case was sentenced yesterday in the District Court by Judge Meng Tingke:

### Heming Hotel Rescues Kidnapped Bride, Several Kidnappers Captured

[Report from this Newspaper] Jin Changjinxingguo, the judicial section chief of the Pudong Yangjing Police Station, recently received a report and arrested the bandits Wang Miaogen and Wang Agen, brothers, who confessed to their accomplice Jin Gen, a kidnapper from the west, currently detained in the Garrison Headquarters for another case.

### Ninth National Party Congress of the Kuomintang, Satisfactorily Concluded Yesterday Afternoon, Second Meeting Held in the Morning, Mayor Reports on Governance, Resolved and Passed 64 Important Cases

[Report from this Newspaper] The Ninth National Congress of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality continued to meet in the City Council yesterday morning and afternoon, and concluded satisfactorily at 7 PM in the afternoon. The opening ceremony was chaired by Chairman Fang, who delivered the closing remarks, and then passed a declaration and shouted slogans, closing the meeting amidst the melodious sound of military music.

Deeply Ashamed of the Serious Housing Shortage

At the second conference held at 9 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Wu delivered a report on governance, stating briefly: The problems of Shanghai's governance can be divided into four parts: (1) Ordinary administrative problems, the main ones of which can be divided into three categories: (A) Street washing. The streets have not been repaired for eight years during the war of resistance, and it is really difficult to repair them now based on the current municipal revenue situation, but the municipal government is still working hard to carry it out. (B) Traffic congestion is common in major cities such as New York and Chicago. Shanghai's roads are old, and the road surface is uneven, while there are many vehicles, which is the main reason for congestion. (C) The housing shortage is partly due to the concentration of population in the city, but the main reason is that no one is building houses. The municipal government originally allocated funds to build houses, but it could not become a reality due to the rapid changes in prices, which made it impossible to solve the city's housing shortage for a long time, and I am deeply ashamed.

Prices Affect Social Problems

(2) Problems arising from the merger of the concessions. A concession cleanup committee has been organized, and currently the former Public Concession has been completely cleared, and the former French Concession is under negotiation. (3) Economic problems are national problems, so they must be resolved in coordination with the central government's policies. Due to the limitations of his authority, the municipal government can only crack down on black markets and speculation in a passive way. In addition, various social problems arise from economic problems, such as (A) price increases leading to appropriations, street vendors obstructing traffic, and poor households leading to fire hazards and epidemics. The municipal government takes into account the lives of the poor. (B) The municipal government itself is unable to budget this year due to price fluctuations. (C) Wages are rising with prices, and many factories are closing down because they cannot afford it. The municipal government is actively promoting labor-management coordination, and wages are being increased to a limited extent. (4) Party issues. The Kuomintang is for the country and the people, and is seeking the safety and prosperity of all citizens. As for those who attempt to sabotage and launch strikes, the government will punish them according to the law.

Uphold Justice, Unite Sincerely

Wu concluded by declaring: Shanghai's governance faces many difficulties that are not found elsewhere. It is difficult to overcome the many difficulties, but the problems still exist. I hope that all comrades in the city will unite sincerely to overcome the difficulties and contribute a few points to the delegates: (1) Uphold justice, (2) Report corruption, (3) Advocate thrift, (4) Unite sincerely. Then the discussion began, and at noon Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for all the delegates at the Central Bank Club. The discussion continued at 3 PM, and the meeting resolved to pass 64 cases, including "Ordinary establishment of grassroots organizations to strengthen party-state activities," "Submit to the Central Government to enrich the economic strength of grassroots party headquarters to increase work efficiency," and the temporary motion "Please ask the conference to immediately telegraph the Central Government to confiscate or use without interest all foreign exchange in the United States held by ordinary wealthy families to replenish the national revival of savings deposits to solve the domestic economic crisis." After review, the conference made resolutions on both Chairman Fang's party affairs report and Mayor Wu's governance report.

List of Elected Executive and Supervisory Committee Members

### Strong Fortress on the Western Hebei Front, Baoding Relieved

[Report from this Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 21st] Baoding has been relieved. The ancient city of western Hebei, which has endured fright and pain, has survived a storm. This reporter entered Baoding with the army for the first inspection. Since this spring, Baoding has been facing the enemy on three sides. Only the Ping-Bao Road is the only artery. When it is cut off, Baoding becomes an isolated island behind enemy lines.

The clouds of war have passed, but the scenes of war remain. Deep trenches and high ramparts surround the city, with barbed wire as dense as a spider web. The city gates are closed every night at 10 o'clock and martial law is enforced. Every day, tens of thousands of civilians dig and repair the moat. From 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM, lines of civilians appear on the streets, in groups of three to five, carrying shovels and dry rations, smiling and staggering toward the construction site. One shovel after another, the outer moat is deepened, the bunkers are completed, and the people's blood and sweat build a Great Wall of life.

Baoding is the often overlooked capital of Hebei Province. It stands alongside Beiping and Tianjin. The center of culture and politics is in Beiping, but commercial trade is taken over by Tianjin. It is not even as good as the new city of Shijiazhuang—before the construction of the Ping-Han Railway, Shijiazhuang was just a remote village. It seems to be

A soulless shell, without vitality, without vigor.

Baoding is actually the "provisional capital" of Hebei. The military and political bigwigs here often travel between Ping and Bao, but their mansions are probably all in Beiping. The command post in Beiping is the nerve center for issuing orders, even more active and spirited than the Pacification Headquarters.

It is said that Hebei's politics are "difficult to handle because there are too many mothers-in-law. There are many people who talk, but few people who take responsibility and do things." The party, government, military, and groups have not yet formed a unified force. Especially on the eve of the general election, everyone is keen on arranging elections. How to cooperate with the military to carry out the work of recovering areas is regarded as a secondary issue.

The city has several classical main streets, neat and full of ancient charm. Fortunately, there are not many cars because the roads are narrow. Baoding is not a center for the distribution of goods, so there are no large merchants. The trading places are quite desolate, especially during the siege. People from the countryside cannot enter, trains do not run, goods are not smooth, and the decline in purchasing power makes business sluggish.

Due to the existence of hostile forces, the city and countryside are under strict blockade. Since open trade is not possible, there is inevitably a sneaky

"Smuggling" phenomenon. The communists exchange cotton for goods from the city. A large batch of medicines was transported away a few days ago, and it is said that they could even buy bullets before. "Those who live near the mountain burn firewood, those who live near the water eat fish." Guarding the passes and taking on inspection duties has become a "lucrative position."

The branches of culture are gradually withering, and Baoding is suffering from cultural anemia due to malnutrition. The only local publication is a four-page "Baoding Daily," but its layout and content are like an evening newspaper. In addition to a few more local news items, its sales are taken away by the Pingjin newspapers that arrive on the same day. Bookstores only have one or two new magazines on the shelves, and the bookshelves are full of old novels and books and periodicals full of low taste. The war makes people irritable. Buried in old novels, the psychology of spending time is a movie theater and a theater, which are now used by the political work team of the Security Command to perform dramas, and the Siwei Drama School performs new Ping opera, which is considered the only artistic activity here.

The market on West Street is the commercial center. Although it does not have the density and prosperity of the Dong'an Market in Beiping, it is still quite large. Several large courtyards are connected to each other, and people come and go like shuttles.

People who have been to Baoding will buy a few baskets of "Baofu side dishes and sweet bean sauce" as gifts. These are Baoding's famous specialties. "Huaimao Company" on West Street is the authority on pickles and sauces. There are two locust trees that can be hugged by talents at the door as its markers. Its history of more than 100 years elevates its status above other peers. The best dishes are soy-sauce almonds, peanuts, and soy-sauce bamboo shoots, costing 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per catty. Ordinary mixed pickles are bought for 3,500 yuan per small basket. After all, the goods are of high quality and taste, unlike ordinary things.

The Ping-Bao Road is damaged, and coal from Mentougou cannot be transported, and the countryside is sealed off, so food cannot enter the city. Fuel and food have become treasures of Baoding. Crushed coal and firewood cost 700 yuan per catty, and white flour sells for more than 4,000 yuan. The people here are living a difficult life under the high pressure of prices.

"Lotus Pond" is the only scenic spot in the city. Artificial hills like stones, pavilions, and terraces decorate a large courtyard into a park. The lotus pond is dozens of feet around, bounded by stone railings, but the pond water has long since dried up. The so-called "Lotus Pond" has long become a historical name. The predecessors planted trees and raised lotus flowers, but people have no intention of cultivating even a fresh flower. The war strangled the fun in the garden, and people have lost the mood to appreciate flowers and play scenery.

The famous Cao Yinhua Garden outside the south city wall is now the site of the Sicheng Middle School. Students armed with guns guard the two gates of the campus. During the war of defense, the students were also fully armed. During the summer vacation,

Students from the communist-held areas cannot return home, and school fees are not available. Everything needs to be self-sufficient. At a cost of 15,000 yuan per day, they act as hired workers and work for other people as civilians. Half work and half study, they are already self-reliant.

When this reporter left Baoding, the Ping-Bao Road had not yet been connected. To get from Baoding to Dingxing, you have to rely on a car. It is said that the communists have robbed the road twice south of Xushui, killing drivers, robbing passengers, and hijacking military and political personnel in the same car. The situation has become tense again recently. As long as the communists in Hebei are not eliminated, the clouds of war will close in on the periphery of Baoding at any time. Building fortifications is necessary, but safety cannot be guaranteed by defense alone. Moats cannot stop the enemy. What is needed now is more effective coordination between the military and the government to advance our political power to every corner. (Special Correspondent Jie Zhong)

### Three Cases of Suspected Traitors, Wan Mengwan Sentenced to Two Years with Three Years Probation, Shen Zhenggang Repeatedly Summoned, Arrest and Interrogation, Bao Xishan's Case of Aiding the Enemy to be Investigated

### Wuxi Criminal Police Team Arrests Bandits

[Report from this Newspaper, Wuxi] The criminal police team arrested four members of the bandit group in Qianqiao Town the day before yesterday afternoon: Zhang, a group member, Wu, a gun repairman, Zhou Agen, and Xu Agen. According to Zhang's confession, they were members of the communist action group and were active in Huangmei Jiashan, Northeast Tang, Bangua Bridge, Baitu Bridge, Zhangjing Bridge, and other places, specializing in kidnapping, robbery, and murder as regular work. After receiving the confession, the team presented it to the General Bureau for review. (Another Telegram) Shi Hongsheng and Liu Deyuan, two suspects in inciting rice looting, have been detained by the District Prosecutor's Office. Since the investigation, the rice mills and shops in Beitang have successively submitted statements to the District Prosecutor's Office to prove that the two had not incited the looting and requested that they be granted bail. After interrogation by the District Prosecutor's Office, Liu Deyuan was granted bail and Shi Hongsheng was kept in custody as before.

### Potent Narcotics, Intercepted on a Ship from Tianjin to Shanghai, 60 Catties of White Powder Worth Over 1 Billion

[Tianjin, 22nd] Amidst strict drug prohibition, the Tianjin Police Bureau recently uncovered another major case of trafficking in potent narcotics, seizing more than 90 taels (about 6 catties) of pure white powder, worth over 1 billion. Three drug traffickers were arrested. This is the largest drug trafficking case in Tianjin in recent years. The details are as follows: The Municipal Police Bureau recently learned that three accomplices, Du Wanqi, Wu Yicheng, and Yang Jinshan, were specializing in purchasing white powder in Pingjin and transporting it to Shanghai for sale in order to seek rights. Because they were extremely cunning, they changed their residences several times a day, making arrest extremely difficult. Later, it was learned that they had transported the narcotics to the "Beiming" ship, which was berthed at the Hedong Wharf in District 1 and about to sail to Shanghai. The police then sent officers to search the ship. Just as the "Beiming" ship was about to set sail, they ordered it to stop, boarded the ship for inspection, arrested Du Wanqi and the other two, and seized the white powder from their luggage. The three criminals and the narcotics were taken to the branch bureau for interrogation.

### Songjiang Death Row Inmates Lu Guisheng and Two Others Demolish Roof Rafters and Escape from Prison

### Two Tax Officials from Changshu Flee; Embezzlement and Abandonment of Duty are Not Isolated Incidents

[Our Changshu 24th Dispatch] Zhou Chan, the section chief of the second section of the local tax bureau, came to Changshu to work with Director Zhang Farong. After several months, he suddenly abandoned his post and fled, leaving no trace. A request for his arrest has been submitted to the Provincial Department of Finance. After the incident occurred, people in the community were very concerned. Zhou had told Director Zhang on the ninth of this month that Zhang Hui, the director of the Inspection Office of the Ministry of Land Affairs, had been appointed as the director of the Qingdao Municipal Land Administration Bureau and invited him to serve as the section chief of the first section. He requested to resign. Director Zhang said that the tax affairs were heavy and it was not convenient to replace him with a novice immediately, so the resignation was temporarily not discussed. Unexpectedly, on the eighteenth, Zhang Hui sent a telegram from the capital, saying: "Please approve Zhou Chan's resignation and come to the capital to take over in Qingdao." Considering the official duties of the employee, it was difficult to comply with the order to approve his resignation. After the telegram was sent back, Zhou did not come to the office to work from the afternoon of the nineteenth. A servant was immediately sent to search for him. According to reports, the landlord of the employee's residence said that he had gone to Qingdao. Director Zhang did not believe it at first, but on the twenty-first, a tax officer, Qin Zhizhong, held a private letter left by Zhou Chan when he left, which confirmed that Zhou had indeed abandoned his post and fled. Because Zhou was in charge of the business tax and autonomous tax of the second section, and his duties were heavy, and he personally handled and kept the accounts, if he did not make a detailed handover, others could not take over. It is believed that personnel who leave their posts without authorization and delay important public affairs should be brought to justice and given appropriate sanctions. A special telegram was sent to the province for his arrest and brought to justice. It is reported that there are many rumors about this incident. Zhou was suspected of embezzling ten million yuan in the previous case of fraud involving bricks, tiles, lime, etc., and the case is currently under thorough investigation. He may have fled out of fear of exposure, or it is said that the telegram from Nanjing was fabricated to create a false impression. The truth is now being investigated and will soon be revealed. [Another Dispatch] Jin Fan, the tax officer of the Dongtang dispatched district of the tax bureau, embezzled a large amount of tax money and fled without a trace. The county government military law office summoned Yun Ruinian, Jin's guarantor, to court for investigation and set a deadline for the case to be handed over for investigation.

### Li Lixia Discusses the Current Price Trend

[Our Dispatch] Li Lixia, director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, yesterday expressed his views on the current price trend and the issue of inspecting firms and banks in his personal capacity as follows:

(1) Price issue: Based on observations in recent years, the possibility of price fluctuations in a year is two-thirds in the first half of the year and one-half in the second half of the year. Every year after July, the price trend gradually tends to stabilize. This is because our country is an agricultural country. After July, it is the autumn harvest season, and agricultural materials are produced in large quantities, and urban currency flows to the countryside. Therefore, urban prices are often more stable in the second half of the year. However, after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the price of yarn and cloth may fluctuate due to the fact that farmers add cloth in the morning. However, since the restoration, the number of yarn and cloth machines has generally increased, so it is expected that the price of yarn and cloth this year will not fluctuate sharply.

Spot Check on Firms and Banks

(2) Issue of inspecting firms and banks: The inspection of firms and banks in this city is directly managed by the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank is in a supporting position. After the Ministry of Finance recently revoked the licenses of several banks, most firms and banks in this city are now aware of the warning, and the practice of substituting licenses has decreased. The authorities' inspection method will first conduct spot checks on unstable firms and banks. Spot checks will be avoided as much as possible on firms and banks with stable operations in order to guide the financial industry onto the right track.

Bran was stable, and high-priced soybean cakes rose slightly by 1,000 yuan, while medium-priced soybean cakes were flat. The market was firm in the morning but weak in the afternoon. Soybeans were active but not strong in this district. Oil factories selectively purchased, and the market was stable.

Mung beans remained similar. Maize from Beiyang was discontinued, plummeting by more than 10,000 yuan. Broad beans were sluggish. Sesame seeds were actively handled by foreign firms, rising by 10,000 yuan together. Raw peanuts were high-priced, while lower-priced peanuts were flat. Wheat prices rose in all producing areas, and buyers were firm, gradually increasing prices by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

The oil market saw very small fluctuations. Not many shipments of raw oil arrived, and it remained firm. Barrelled raw oil was stable. Factory raw oil fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan due to large-scale sales by vegetable oil factories. Sesame oil was stable. Rapeseed oil was temporarily quiet, and clarified oil was flat. For soybean oil, the Changguo Kunshan factory had many shipments arriving, and the factory's supply continued, falling by 10,000 yuan.

### Comparison of Price Fluctuations of Woolen Fabrics Over the Years

The changes in woolen fabrics from 1933 to this year have been extremely large. The general trends of prices over the years are recorded as follows:

On May 1, 1933, the tael system was abolished and replaced with the yuan. On the 22nd, the new tariff regulations were announced. The standard prices of woolen fabrics were still lower than the previous year because of the large number of goods arriving from the East and the West.

In July 1937, the July 7th Incident occurred, and transactions in Shanghai decreased sharply. Imported goods were all stored in bonded warehouses. On August 13th, the Shanghai Battle broke out, and business was suspended for more than half a month. Dealers all sent letters and telegrams to stop or withdraw shipments, and many of the goods in transit were temporarily unloaded at ports such as Hong Kong and Singapore.

In 1941, prices of all goods rose due to the situation at home and abroad, causing those with capital to hoard goods. At the same time, the population concentrated in Shanghai, stimulating street sales, and sales to customers were also active due to improved transportation. Imported woolen fabrics and other goods were difficult to transport, making local woolen fabrics the darlings of the market. Hoarders made huge profits, and more and more people inside and outside the industry switched to speculating. On December 8th, enemy troops entered the concession, and the woolen fabric market suddenly declined. Although Hong Kong had fallen and the war had begun, cutting off supplies, prices were unable to rise due to the end-of-year period.

In 1942, the enemy puppet regime ordered the use of puppet currency at a ratio of 2:1, and woolen fabric prices rose daily. The public had no confidence in the puppet currency, and the trend of hoarding and speculation became even more intense.

In February and March 1945, market prices once fell, with most falling within the price limits, and wholesale and retail sales both decreased significantly. After mid-April, prices suddenly soared due to rumors in the market after the death of US President Roosevelt, and news of favorable purchases spread, believing that woolen fabric prices would definitely rise, with even more intense increases in July and August. On August 15th, Japan formally surrendered unconditionally, and the Allied Nations won a great victory, and prices finally turned sharply downward. On October 1st, all buying and selling was changed to the legal tender as the standard, but due to rising postal rates, train fares, boat prices, water and electricity, and public service fees, as well as the large number of people from the inland areas coming to Shanghai to make clothes, coupled with the lack of production by factories, prices continued to soar.

This year, due to various environmental factors and the impact of soaring prices of gold, rice, daily necessities, and other goods, woolen fabric prices all soared. Local goods were the only ones that did not increase in price.

Recently, the China Trust Bureau has shipped in large quantities of Japanese woolen fabrics, and many private goods from Hong Kong have also been shipped to Shanghai. At the same time, it is the hot summer season, and the actual sales to retail customers have declined, and the market has slightly weakened.

The price trends over the years are published below:

### Corrections Regarding the Yin Dynasty Calendar

— Chen Zizhan

Professor Lu Shixian's recent book, "Corrections and Explanations of the Yin Dynasty Calendar," is a rebuttal of Mr. Dong Yantang (Zuobin), a researcher at the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, and his "Yin Dynasty Calendar." Mr. Dong's book took more than ten years to complete and is regarded as a great achievement in academic circles. Mr. Fu Mengzhen (Sinian) wrote the preface, stating, "Mr. Yantang's scholarship is respected in the world. If later students do not come forward with courage, how can they show themselves? It is like the story of Tang Monk's journey to the West, where he encounters monsters and gods everywhere, trying to get a piece of the pie. To evaluate this book comprehensively, there are some prerequisites: first, the person must be as familiar with oracle bone inscriptions as Mr. Yantang; second, the person must have the same knowledge of calendar systems as Mr. Yantang; third, the person must spend several years of effort. But this is absolutely impossible." It is not that "absolutely impossible things" do not exist; there are many examples. Let's take Mr. Lu's book as an example. Mr. Lu is an authority on contemporary calendar studies, and he is also well-versed in the four classics and deeply knowledgeable in bronze inscriptions and oracle bone inscriptions. Therefore, his criticisms and arguments are extremely precise. He thoroughly examines Mr. Dong's theories on periodization, the system of sacrifices, the calendar system used, the determined dates, and the oracle bone inscriptions and bronze artifacts used as evidence. The entire book is more than 100,000 words long and includes 57 ancient calendar tables. It is based purely on an objective attitude and expressed in elegant and incisive writing, with no superfluous words or ambiguous statements. Its breadth of comprehensiveness and rigor of structure are rare in academic works of the past 30 years.

The "Corrections" are divided into two parts, upper and lower. The upper part begins: "In the midsummer of the year *Yi You*, Mr. Dong Zuobin published his "Yin Dynasty Calendar," listed as ten tables, divided into two series, with a total of fourteen volumes. It uses oracle bone inscriptions to list the calendar of the Yin Dynasty and is the result of ten years of thought. For the calendar, it provides detailed information from the time of Pan Geng to the present. For the oracle bone inscriptions, it gathers scattered fragments from the time of Wu Ding onwards. The calendar relies on oracle bone inscriptions for verification, and the oracle bone inscriptions rely on the calendar for classification. Some believe that the rituals of the Yin and Shang dynasties and the conquests of the barbarians are clearly presented as a chronological history. Others say that the author has organized the scattered fragments and clarified the obscure, just like 'sewing a coat of hundreds of patches and stringing together a necklace of nine-bend pearls.' It is truly a great and difficult undertaking, and a precious classic for the academic community. I heard that this book was being compiled and refined, and it had already gained a reputation in academic circles. When the work was finally completed, everyone marveled at it as a great creation. In my humble opinion, there are many doubts, so I do not avoid directness and present my humble views. I hope to gain a true understanding of the truth and not dare to deliberately be different. In the most general terms, there are three categories: the years cannot be verified, there is no evidence for the Yin Dynasty calendar, and the oracle bone inscriptions are difficult to rely on. Although this is a summary of the main points and a discussion of the general principles, it comprehensively covers Mr. Dong's arguments. The so-called 'evaluating the entire book' is nothing more than this." From this, the main outline of Mr. Lu's book can be seen.

The conclusion of the upper part reads: "Based on the example of the entire book, the year sequence and calendar calculations are like the surface, while the oracle bone inscriptions and bronze artifacts used as evidence are like the water clock and official records. If the surface is tilted, the water clock will be inaccurate; if the tassel is disordered, the court positions will be misplaced. These are mutually referencing and cannot tolerate even the slightest error. Moreover, the meanings of these three, whether in general or in detail, are repeatedly contradictory. Therefore, the main purpose of the entire compilation cannot be supported by a single word. It is wounded all over, and it is difficult to apply acupuncture. Anyone with a basic understanding of literature can see its flaws. Examining its arguments, the words of doubt are turned into solid evidence. Examining its evidence, the author uses his own theories to provide far-fetched explanations. He has not been able to conduct extensive and detailed research, and he has not seen the many different opinions. If it is said that writing should be concise, then its redundancy is excessive. Such a discussion is inherently worthless. It is only because the ignorant see it as reasonable and the sycophants praise it as innovative that I do not hesitate to waste my time to write this criticism. In short, any year dating on bronze inscriptions is like drawing ghosts, and any dating of oracle bone inscriptions is like catching wind. And yet, the author speaks with detail, as if he had personally witnessed it; he arranges the months and days in greater detail than the historical records of past dynasties. He does not know that the unproven accusations cannot convince people, and the imagined stories cannot be trusted. And yet, he boasts of solid evidence and makes unfounded judgments without doubt; he has repeatedly seen chapters but does not examine them in detail. This is because he is blinded by preconceptions, which cannot be excused. Even his theories are crude and contradictory, probably because the writing was rushed and not thorough. As for the use of calendar calculations and the assistance of astronomers, there are precedents in ancient times, such as the "Huainanzi" and "Lüshi Chunqiu," which are not blameworthy. The entire book is based on theories that are mostly plagiarized from others without attribution, which is also a common practice. Matters of this kind are all excusable, but the flatterers praise them as 'thoroughly understanding' and 'well-versed,' and laud them as 'respected by the world,' which is an exaggeration and cannot be excused. If questioned by the author, he would not admit it himself. Using this to bully others is ridiculous and laughable. Moreover, they say that no one can dispel the darkness, which is absolutely impossible. It should be displayed at the gates of the country and cannot be added to or subtracted from. This is simply foolishness and delusion, and it is a vain threat to the public and cannot be discussed with!" It can be seen that Mr. Lu wrote this book because he was provoked by Mr. Dong's excessive "self-praise" and Mr. Fu's deliberate "bullying" of others. What is the purpose of criticism? To correct falsehoods. Whether this is right or wrong remains to be seen. Originally, the intention of Mr. Fu and Mr. Dong seemed to be to establish absolute authority in academics, implicitly considering themselves as the elite of the academic world. Professor Liu Chaoyang, who studies the new calendar, has already written "Doubts on the Yin Dynasty Calendar," "Further Discussion on the Yin Dynasty Calendar," and "Third Discussion on the Yin Dynasty Calendar." Professor Lu Shixian, who studies the ancient calendar, has also written "Corrections and Explanations of the Yin Dynasty Calendar." Are Mr. Liu and Mr. Lu like the Allied commanders entering Rome to capture Berlin? This is truly a great story in academic history.

The lower part of "Corrections" takes Mr. Dong's calendar table for the sixth year of the reign of Zu Jia and compares it with 57 kinds of calendar calculations from ancient times. Mr. Lu's preface states: "After the writing was completed, I took the calendar calculations of various dynasties, calculated the solstices and equinoxes, and included them in the lower part to see the similarities and differences and to distinguish the gains and losses. The year studied is the sixth year of the reign of Zu Jia, as mentioned by Mr. Dong; the calendars selected include the explicit records in historical documents. There are also some calendar systems whose calculations are not detailed but have been verified by previous scholars. If they are found to be correct, they are also listed. As for the corrections made by various scholars and my own supplements, they are available in various books and can be consulted for reference, so I will not quote them here to avoid redundancy. As for the Zheng Yuan and Zhang Mengbin calendars, although they have been supplemented, they are still questionable. Such cases are not included. The book of *Ren Dun* mentions calendar calculations but only shows contradictions and is not worth mentioning. Since the late Ming Dynasty, private calendars have been quite numerous, either following the old systems or adopting Western methods, but they have all changed the basic elements and have not been verified by actual measurements. Such cases are also excluded. There are also some calendars that have different names but the same calculations; there are also calendars that are contemporary but have slightly different remainders, but the solstices and equinoxes are the same. For example, the Five Periods calendar of the Tang Dynasty is no different from the Linde calendar; the Datong calendar of the Ming Dynasty is a copy of the Shoushi calendar. Also, the Taichu calendar of the Han Dynasty completely copied the Zhou calendar. Although their accumulated years are different, the solstices and equinoxes are the same. The Daming calendar of the Jin Dynasty was created by Yang Ji, and its accumulated years are more than that of Zhao, but because the calculations are the same, only the remainder of the month is slightly different. For cases of this kind, I only selected one example to show the two calendars. The contents of this part are not repeated. In some calculations that do not start from the winter solstice, there are the *Zhuan Xu* calendar of the Qin Dynasty and the Yuanjia calendar of the Song Dynasty. The *Zhuan Xu* calendar starts counting from the beginning of spring because its intercalation of leap months is not based on the absence of the middle *qi*, so it is excluded from the other calendars. Although the Yuanjia calendar starts counting from the spring equinox, this part traces back to the winter solstice for inclusion. The reason for standardizing the units is to facilitate the comparison of similarities and differences." Mr. Lu compares the calendars of various dynasties with the "Yin Dynasty Calendar" to prove the similarities and differences and to clarify the gains and losses. It uses purely objective calculations to measure them. How will Mr. Dong, who is said to "thoroughly understand calendar systems," respond? And the "absolutely impossible thing" has actually happened. How will Mr. Fu deny it?

Mr. Lu's book will be printed by lithography. If any publisher is willing to undertake the printing, Mr. Lu is willing to transfer the copyright. Mr. Lu humbly places himself in the ranks of "later students," implying that Mr. Fu and Mr. Dong, who consider themselves teachers and veterans, will have strict instructions regarding the publication of Mr. Lu's book?

I have briefly stated my humble opinions on Mr. Dong's and Mr. Lu's books in my long poem "Turtle Calendar Song," which I will not repeat here.

### Love of Zhenjiang

— Ge Shangde

I long for Zhenjiang, I long for Zhenjiang, the old touring ground of nearly twenty years ago.

Zhenjiang, in the pages of history, has condensed into many stories that make people yearn for: the hermit Jiao Guang of Jiao Mountain at the end of the Han Dynasty; the Wudi's temporary capital of Dantu; the Jin prisoner - Fu Jian's subordinate - imprisoned in Jinshan; Madam Liang's drumming in the Yuan Shu campaign; ... These stories evoke nostalgia in people's hearts.

The majestic mountains and rivers and the beautiful scenery adorn a stage for the protagonists in the above stories to gallop across or to roam in seclusion; at the same time, these majestic mountains and rivers, this beautiful scenery, are precisely for us, for our children and grandchildren, to forever support pride and arrogance.

During a not-so-brief period of life in Zhenjiang, I am confident that I have indeed explored the great and sublime soul of Zhenjiang.

On many evenings, I took the time to stroll to the top of Beigushan in the north of the city to conduct a thorough inspection, to gaze attentively into the distance, and to read books in silence. The tower said to be dressed by Mrs. Sun, the stone said to have been tested by Liu Xuande's sword, the slope said to have been driven by Xuande and Sun Zhongmou, and the Wangjiang Pavilion said to be the place where Mrs. Sun threw herself into the river, are scattered on the hillside and the top of the mountain, reminding people of the active posture of the ancient heroes. One evening after a heavy snow, I leaned in the Wangjiang Pavilion, reading Turgenev's Rudin, sometimes also turning my eyes leisurely to the opposite side of the river with the snow.

On many holidays, I bought a boat to play on the central Jiao Mountain of the river. Imagining that this is exactly the soil where Jiao Chushi left his footprints, and at the same time looking up at the east flow of the rushing river - a picture of Madam Anguo drumming appears unconsciously again.

On many days, I ran from a distant residence to the top of Jinshan. Here I tasted the glorious victory of our nation defeating Fu Jian and imprisoning the Di prisoners; I proudly roared at the mountains and rivers.

At many times, I ran to the southern suburbs of Zhenjiang alone, walking slowly on the sheep gut path between the rolling hills. While reading a book, I often squatted down and picked the small flowers on the roadside and clipped them into the book. I remember those books clearly were short stories by Maupassant and the like.

Although the tide of time has surged and nearly twenty years have passed in an instant; but it has never been able to erode the impression in my heart - the profound impression that the old touring ground of Zhenjiang left me.

Zhenjiang is a beautiful poem of ancient times, a beautiful poem of modern times, and also a beautiful poem of the future.

I miss Zhenjiang, I sing for Zhenjiang with the greatest enthusiasm.

### The Painter's Wife

—Kakasso

Pablo Picasso (1881-) is the originator of Cubism and the leader of the modern European art world. The average person only knows that he is a Cubist writer, but unexpectedly, in the salon of 1938, he discovered an extremely classical portrait, which made people feel extraordinarily surprised, so the absurd criticism of "no basic sketches" was wiped out. This also illustrates that Picasso is not unable to paint so vividly, but he is unwilling to waste his precious time in this way. (Liu Shi)

### My Family's Osmanthus Literature

— Zha Mengji

In Western literature, the "Osmanthus", which symbolizes victory, is often seen praised endlessly in the chapters of poets. Speaking of China's "Osmanthus", I have not actually verified whether it is a lineage with the laurel, but in terms of its color, fragrance, and taste, it can be regarded as a first-class breed.

In the past, during the imperial examination era, this flower was widely used to compare with the clean and noble imperial examination. The "Zhuangyuan" who "solely occupies the top of the Ao" always wore two golden flowers on his hat. Gold is the true color of "Osmanthus", so it seems that the meaning of the term "laurel crown" in the West is not very different.

Our surname Zha in Haining, almost all the families who study still retain one or two osmanthus branches. The history of my family's osmanthus trees is said to be very strange by the older generations. It is said that our ancestors, whenever a "Xiucai" or higher like "Juren", "Jinshi" and so on appeared, the osmanthus branch in this autumn always flourished especially. A frustrated scholar who had failed many times came to my house to steal a branch of "Osmanthus" back, and that year he actually "passed the exam"; so my family's "Osmanthus" became a wonderful tree in the literary world. Zha Shenxing, the old man of Chu Bai, also mentioned the name "Osmanthus" many times in his "Jingyetang Poetry Collection". He has a poem "Leaving Runmu and following the rhymes sent by my brothers":

"Pointing to Linlu and looking far away, the magpies follow the door in the morning and the crows in the evening. The Paulownia is a tree planted by the ancestors, and the Osmanthus is a flower that passes the exam in my family. The fence behind the house should be repaired with bamboo, and the land west of the wall is barren and suitable for tea. I lack the strength to farm, but I can add to the planting in the book."

There are two self-notes in this poem, and I will put them down now:

(1) "The Paulownia on the pond was planted by my late father, and it has been embraced for twenty years. The Song people called the Han brothers as the 'Paulownia Han family'."

(2) "My family originally had five silver osmanthus trees. Since Guiyou, whenever there is an imperial examination, if the brothers, nephews, and nephews get outstanding results, a branch of golden flowers will be sent as a precursor, which has always been accurate."

The "Runmu" mentioned in the poem title is Siting, the younger brother of the old man of Chu Bai, a famous figure in the literary inquisition of the Qing Dynasty. The "younger brother" mentioned is the second younger brother Si, also known as Deyin. He has a poem "For Deyin Title Zhapu Study Picture":

"Two oblique suns pass over the wall, after class, I often watch the shadow of the osmanthus move; this tree has been full of life in recent years, how can I talk about the time when I was a child when I was old?"

This poem also has a self-note:

"The small room on the east side of the hall is where I and my younger brother studied when we were young. There is an old osmanthus tree in the yard. Every time I watch the shadow of the tree on the wall, it is time to leave school,

Now the osmanthus has been used as firewood".

Also, the poem "Deyin Fake Goes Out to Allude to Don't":

"Planting Osmanthus and Transplanting Pine have been for two years, and I often send letters home to ask about the western tomb. How easy is it to talk about the two acres in Luoyang? I am a little happy that I have a tomb field for farming".

He often talks about Osmanthus, and he often reflects his own changing life from Osmanthus. I introduce this school of "Osmanthus Literature" to the readers, and by the way, I tell you: After the imperial examination declined with the trend of the times, the value of "Osmanthus" was not affected by anything. Now the old women in my hometown still worship "Osmanthus" as before, and the rise and fall of Osmanthus is enough to predict the legend of the rise and fall of the family, which is still mixed with feng shui divination from "Osmanthus Literature" to a "Osmanthus Philosophy" and popular in the village of "Osmanthus fragrans".

### A Slice of Our Land, A Drop of Our Blood 385

— Ye Jingfeng

Yaoqun was still making tight turns when a sharp, piercing whistle came from the sky, the signal of Little Tiger; the whistling sound crashed against the mountain walls on both sides, creating cyclical echoes, as if the entire valley was filled with people whistling in the same way, a continuous and piercing sound. When Yaoqun heard this signal, she suddenly realized that the old fort must have received news of their return and sent people out to meet them, who happened to run into Little Tiger, so they came rushing over together. Thinking of this, she felt happy and immediately loosened the reins and rode forward; at the same time, she let out a long whistle in response to Little Tiger's signal.

The speed of both sides running towards each other was like a storm, and the momentum was at its peak; so, such a long distance would soon be covered. The closer they got, the clearer Yaoqun could see; it was soon confirmed that her guess was correct. From a distance, the other group seemed to be riding in single file, with their horses closely following each other due to the straight line obscuring the relative positions. But as they got closer, it became clear that there was a long distance between the first rider and the second or third.

Yaoqun saw that the approaching riders were not far away, about sixty to ninety feet or so, and gently tugged on the reins, preparing to slow down. But the first rider on the other side had the same idea, but acted faster, pulling back so sharply that the horse's hind legs dug into the ground, its front half rising and falling as it spun in place.

"Elder... Aunt Ji!" Little Tiger whistled, calling out to Yaoqun.

"Hey..." Yaoqun replied as she slowed her charge. "Who is it?" She was eager to know who was coming.

Before Yaoqun could finish speaking, her horse had already run close to Little Tiger. Before Little Tiger's answer could be heard clearly, the two riders behind him had already reached Little Tiger's side; their horses' momentum had not completely stopped when the riders jumped off their backs, ran a few steps, and stood together on the side of the road:

"Hello, Miss!... " A loud, booming voice greeted Yaoqun first: "Greetings to you!... The fort received word early, knowing that you two have glor... glor... gloriously returned!" The word "gloriously returned" seemed to be a spur-of-the-moment invention, not very smoothly delivered.

"Hey... Old Neng?" Yaoqun was only about six feet away from the speaker. "Is that Master Wu Er?"... The person didn't speak, and in the moonlight, she couldn't see clearly, so Yaoqun could only guess.

Shanghai Jottings

### People of Color

— Shilang

Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally protest the Shen Chong case, hoping to obtain a "fair" reply. White Americans who are raped by black men are sentenced to death, while white American sailors who rape Chinese women in China are given lenient sentences.

But American and British discrimination against people of color is world-renowned. In Xiao Qian's "Life Interviews," the author encounters a secret goddess in England, but even she abandoned her business because the author was a yellow person.

And John Gunther's "Inside U.S.A." reveals the truth about Americans' mistreatment of black people, saying:

"Shortly before the end of World War II, someone asked a black girl how she planned to punish Hitler, and she replied, 'Paint him black and bring him here.' " (Black and white people in the United States are segregated).

It also says that two young black men were "suspected" of breaking into a white woman's house, but were released due to insufficient evidence. But these two black men were captured by a group of unidentified people and executed with cruel punishments; one had both hands chopped off and was burned to death with a welding iron on his head and body; the other was seriously injured and barely survived.

The case had no follow-up and no one investigated it.

There are a total of thirteen million black people in the United States, who suffer physical and mental abuse from white people.

No wonder American sailors can rape our dignified Peking University students and get away with light sentences, deemed insufficient evidence, and acquitted.

But the Chinese are not slaves in the black areas of America; they are allies who fought alongside them against the war of violence!

### Relief of Kuanglu

— Zhang Ming

When you are caught in a sudden mountain rain, sitting in a sedan chair, walking on a rugged and winding slope, turning left to see a peak and turning right to encounter a valley, you may have a thought: "These mountains may never end." Because at a juncture where there seems to be no road and no people in sight, you may suddenly step onto a flat road, and as the path twists and turns, amidst the shade of green trees and a few red tiles, you may not feel as if you have already ascended to immortality?

But just when you feel that two peaks stand facing each other, with a wide path in between, suddenly there is another steep slope upwards, with a sheer cliff on one side and a pond below on the other. At this time, with the wind whistling through the pines and strange birds chirping, how can you not feel a sense of fear? Especially when you look ahead, clouds rise from under your feet, soaring up like white silk, instantly engulfing the myriad valleys and peaks. But, for a short time of only one or two minutes, or at most five to ten minutes, this cloud will immediately dissipate, and before your eyes is a scene of openness. If you have been to Lushan, you will know the wonderful sight of clouds covering the sky when viewed from the mountainside, and at the same time, you will have admired the beautiful lake scenery from the mountaintop after the clouds have cleared. Since ancient times, Lushan has given people a dreamlike feeling, a mysterious and intriguing charm. Su Dongpo once wrote a famous line about Lushan: "Viewed horizontally, it becomes a ridge; viewed sideways, it becomes a peak; viewed from different places, the mountains are different. I cannot recognize the true face of Lushan, because I am in the midst of the mountain." To this day, we cannot find a single book that describes the true face of Lushan, which is enough to show that Lushan is a mystery.

Why is Lushan a mystery? Why are there sudden clouds? And why are there mists that cannot be driven away? The biggest reason is that it is close to the river and borders the lake, gathering the essence of rivers and lakes. The vastness of the Yangtze River and the beauty of Poyang Lake set off the majestic and unique Lushan in a misty rain.

The highest peak of Lushan is 1,543 meters high, named Dahanyang Peak. Some say that climbing Dahanyang Peak and looking around at the peaks, even the Five Old Men Peak, the main peak of Lushan, seems to bow down. The height of Dahanyang Peak is equal to the highest point of Mount Tai, and the peak is flat and sparsely wooded. Looking down, the wilderness is vast and boundless, truly unfathomable. Because the place is too high, there are often clouds and mists, so climbing to the top and looking around, the waters of the Yangtze River and the mists of Pengli converge into clouds and mists, appearing and disappearing, creating a magnificent scene. It is said that if you visit on a clear day, you can see the misty trees of Hanyang in the distance. At the same time, there is a cliff in front of the peak, called Yuwang Cliff, which is said to be where King Yu of Xia Dynasty climbed when he was taming the floods, but this is naturally a speculation.

The main peak of Lushan, the Five Old Men Peak, originally came from one mountain, with a distance of about half a mile to three-quarters of a mile between them. The five peaks are equally steep and majestic. On the top of the third peak, there is a stone inscription "The sun is close and the clouds are low," which shows the momentum after climbing the peak. There is a descriptive sentence "Walking touches the birthplace of clouds, the body is level with flying birds" which is indeed a realistic sentence. Below the Five Old Men Peak are five small peaks, and there is also the Five Old Men Cave, all scenic spots in Lushan, but unfortunately they are extremely dangerous, and it is said that fierce beasts appear and disappear unpredictably, so few tourists who arrive at Guling visit the Five Old Men Peak.

Besides the mountain peaks, the various waterfalls are also a spectacle, such as Yuyuan, Three-Tier Spring, Qingyu Gorge, Yulian Spring, Gulian Spring, Wangjiapo Waterfall, and Shimenjian Waterfall, each with its own majestic and interesting features. However, the reporter was never able to visit them in person, but only listened to the old mountain people tell you about them like describing a magical novel. For example, the Three-Tier Spring, how it comes out from behind the Five Old Men Peak, with only a wisp of white spring like silk, gurgling down, shaped like a galloping horse, with a grand momentum, this is the first tier. The second tier is below the bedrock, and the third tier is further down, reaching a total length of 1,200 feet. There have been tourists who, while climbing and gazing, were suddenly caught in a strong wind and swept into the pool, resulting in death. Another example is Gulian Spring, known as the best in the world, especially the first view, its spectacle lies in the fact that after the spring emerges from its source, it scatters into dozens or hundreds of strands, arranged like jade curtains, with a special flavor when viewed from afar.

Lushan is a magical mountain. The reporter only entered the mountain for four days and naturally does not know its mysteries, but when I open the window in the morning, the valleys are filled with clouds, while at noon, the peaks are full of golden light. In the evening, the sunlight dims and the wind may rise and the clouds surge, bringing a great storm in a moment. By night, the symphony of pine waves and flowing springs plays a rhythmic and tragic song. These are enough for you to understand the magic and mysterious charm of Lushan. I cannot understand it, but after entering the mountain, I can at least experience it. (August 12th)

### Antarctic Expedition

— Bao Zhongqi

U.S. Admiral Richard E. Byrd led an expedition to the icy and snowy Antarctic last winter and made great gains. In the vast area, they discovered many freshwater lakes and mountains that had never been seen before. They took photos from airplanes and drew detailed maps.

Initially, the expedition departed from Norfolk on the east coast aboard the flagship USS Mount Olympus. As the ship crossed the equator, winter clothing was distributed to the crew. When passing Cape Horn, the weather was already very cold. When the flagship stopped to refuel, seals sleeping on the ice could be seen from the deck. They had never seen humans before, so when the photographer's lens was pointed at them, some quickly left, while the rest showed surprised eyes, looking straight at the camera.

From Cape Horn onwards, the other accompanying oil tankers, submarines, and other ships returned to the United States. Only a strong icebreaker led the flagship and two transport ships through the frozen Ross Sea, heading towards the destination – Little America in Antarctica.

Amidst fierce resistance from the ice, the Mount Olympus sailed into the port of Little America. The crew quickly set up camp using tractors in the "Antarctic summer" (above zero degrees), and used physics to build snow walls in front of the entrance as windbreaks. One hundred and ninety-seven expedition members began investigation and research work in a new way of life.

When severe storms struck the camp, all work was suspended, all equipment was frozen, and the aircraft lay dormant in the ice. Many people who were not accustomed to this environment lost their vitality for hours.

To protect the staff's faces from excessive cold, they wore masks with heating tubes, otherwise the air exhaled from their nostrils would instantly freeze into ice beads on their beards, because the mercury on the thermometer was pointing at minus twenty-three degrees!

"The gateway to Antarctica is made of icebergs, some as high as two hundred feet," Byrd reported upon his return. "Therefore, the radar operators must work all day to break through this obstacle." Message to: Mr. Fang Ren and Mr. Zheng Hongji: Please indicate your address so that we can send you the manuscript fee slip. The original address is unknown and has been returned.

### American Miscellany

The American Unemployment Board

You must find the term "Unemployment Board" very unfamiliar, but you must also find it very interesting. Hearing that unemployed people can receive $80 in unemployment benefits each month must be surprising. Being unemployed with $80 a month in income is much richer than a Chinese university professor who is not unemployed. China does not have an unemployment board, only employment agencies, which are obligated to introduce jobs but are not responsible for success or failure. If you starve to death before being introduced to a job, that's your own fault. The style of the American Unemployment Board is very different. The board puts the responsibility for people's unemployment on the government's head, truly saying, "The people's unemployment is my responsibility" (this sentence is made up by the author; it is not found in the Four Books and Five Classics). Because the people have fulfilled their obligation to pay taxes, the government must solve their livelihood problems. This leads to the genuine issue of people's livelihood. The Unemployment Board is available in every county. At the entrance of the Unemployment Board are notices advertising talent waiting to be hired, and there are also frequent advertisements in the local newspapers for talent waiting to be hired. Anyone who is unemployed can register with the Unemployment Board and receive a monthly stipend of $80 until they find a job. However, if they introduce you to a suitable job and you are lazy and do not go to work, and they find out, you will no longer receive your stipend. Americans like to work and do not want to receive handouts, so once they find a job, they no longer receive the stipend. This system only works in America. First, when all institutions, companies, and stores need talent, they never pull in their maternal uncles and nephews, that is, they do not have any personal bad habits, so all the talent at the Unemployment Board has a way out; second, there are many emerging industries in America, which require a large number of talent, so the Unemployment Board actually laments the lack of talent, having a large amount of unemployment benefits but not enough unemployed people to receive them; third, Americans are rich in the spirit of self-reliance, and there are not many people who are willing to be unemployed and sit and receive ready-made stipends. Except for the elderly, disabled, and sick who must rely on stipends for life, those with work skills would rather work and take $79 than be idle and take $80. $80 in US dollars is worth almost 4 million yuan at the black market rate, enough to go dancing all night. If China also had an unemployment board issuing stipends, the number of unemployed people in China would definitely increase. The Unemployment Board is a losing business. Americans pay attention to business, so why do they have to do this losing business? They lose this small amount of capital, but they prevent people from taking risks due to unemployment. This is a method of doing a losing small business to protect a big business. Ask yourself, if society is unstable, can you make a fortune in peace? America no longer has national disasters, so it is impossible to make a fortune from national disasters. Americans' strength is foresight and willingness to invest capital, like the Lend-Lease Act, a huge amount of capital that only Americans are willing to invest, which ultimately brought them markets in various countries. If you say they are stupid, you are the stupid one. Americans usually spend five cents to buy you a bottle of Coca-Cola, but they also weigh the value of those five cents. Do you think they are stupid? The Unemployment Board is a clever facility, worth adopting. (43)

### Disputes Arising from Land Leases for House Building Cause Relatives to Fall Out and Almost Lead to Litigation

Dear Editor: I have a piece of vacant land that I leased to a relative, Mr. So-and-so, in 1927 to build six tile-roofed houses. In 1929, a contract was signed stipulating an annual land rent of six yuan and a term of ten years, after which I would have the right to redeem the houses. Later, I left Shanghai due to the War of Resistance and returned home after the victory, which was many years overdue. I originally intended to ask a middleman to assess the price and redeem the houses, but Mr. So-and-so insisted on redeeming the houses by converting the current rice price to the construction cost at that time, due to the different currency system. We have been at loggerheads until now without a resolution. I have several doubts about this: (1) Is his coercion legal, and is there any explicit provision? (2) If I want to sue in court, what procedures must I follow?

[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) Since the lease term has expired, the tenant agrees to redeem the houses at a price, but demands an increased payment based on the depreciation of the currency. According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation for the Restoration of Order, the other party's claim is not unreasonable. The law does not specify how much the increase in payment should be. In general, the court often orders performance at a thousand times the original amount. (2) For lawsuits involving real estate rights, the court with jurisdiction is exclusively the court where the real estate is located. To sue for a judgment ordering the return of the leased property, litigation costs must be paid at a rate of 13 per thousand of the assessed value of the disputed subject matter.
