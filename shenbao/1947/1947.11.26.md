### Internal Telegram to All Provincial Governments to Expedite Household Registration

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Ministry of Interior recently sent a telegram to all provincial governments stating that household registration work had been universally carried out in safe counties and cities in the 36th year, but the areas where communist bandits roamed and remote provinces and regions were unable to conduct it in a timely manner. Those that had been carried out were also affected by the mobilization for suppressing the rebellion and were unable to reach the ideal stage. The 37th year is a year of simultaneous bandit suppression and constitutional government, and a complete household registration book is necessary as a basis. All provincial administrative plans for the 37th year should still list household registration as the central task. Those who have not yet done so should speed up the process, and those who have already done so should find ways to improve it. The ministry also provided five key points, requesting implementation: Counties and cities that were recovered in the second half of the 36th year, and safe counties and cities that failed to complete registration in the 36th year due to various reasons, should complete household registration in the first half of the 37th year. Those recovered in the first half of the 37th year should complete household registration in the second half of the same year. Counties and cities that have completed household registration should continue to carry out various dynamic registrations. Under the principle of no missing households or people, special attention should be paid to the registration of births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. Lists of strong men and national soldiers in each county and city should be completed by April of the 37th year. Select one or two counties and cities with the best demonstration and competition results in the 36th year to conduct demonstrations, and where funds are sufficient, efforts should be made to adopt card registration. Continue to conduct competitions in accordance with the "Implementation Measures for the Household Registration Work Competition" promulgated by the ministry.

### Election Disputes in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 25th] In Lin Sen County, the ballot boxes from the Rongqiao and Shuangxiang polling stations were stolen by voters on the afternoon of the third day of the election, preventing other voters from casting their ballots, causing disputes.

### Adjustment of District Assignments Needed for Legislative Yuan Candidates from Two Parties; Kuomintang Invites Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties for Further Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Regarding the list of Legislative Yuan candidates from political parties, the three parties are scheduled to meet at Sun Ke's residence at 10:00 AM on the 26th to discuss the matter. After the Kuomintang received the preliminary lists from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee's election guidance committee held a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 25th to discuss the matter. The two parties had nominated candidates for over 40 districts, but neither party had nominated candidates for certain districts. Therefore, assigning districts was very difficult, and the issue of the number of seats also needed to be agreed upon. The joint committee nominated Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and others to continue negotiating with the two parties on the 26th. It is also learned that after receiving the lists from the two parties, the Kuomintang had sent a joint letter to the two parties, signed by Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, and Chen Lifu, explaining the issue of duplication and requesting changes. Otherwise, the two parties would be allowed to freely compete in the same district. People from both parties found this difficult to resolve, so the list could not be submitted on the 25th. Zhang Junmai arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 25th and visited Zhang Cailu and others for talks. A decision may be made at the three-party meeting on the 26th.

### Xu Fu-lin to Suggest Postponing Election of Control Yuan Members

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The central government originally scheduled the election of Control Yuan members from November 16 to December 10, but the regulations for the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties to participate in the provincial and municipal councils have not yet been officially promulgated by the National Government. As a result, the two parties have not been able to nominate candidates. Since Control Yuan members are elected by the councils, if the two parties cannot participate in the councils, they will not be able to participate in the election of Control Yuan members. Recognizing this, Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party told reporters on the 25th that he intends to suggest that the authorities extend the election deadline so that members of both parties can participate in the councils.

### Members of Legislative and Control Yuans and People's Political Council Jointly Visit Chairman Chiang

Presenting Opinions on National Assembly General Election

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Six representatives of the Kuomintang from the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and People's Political Council jointly met with Chairman Chiang less than 24 hours after the conclusion of the National Assembly representative elections to express their dissatisfaction with the election process and concerns that it would harm the Kuomintang's reputation. It is reported that the Kuomintang candidates' registration method was quite unfair, regardless of their personal morality, knowledge, or qualifications. As long as they had a "backer" in the Central Party Headquarters, they had hope. On the contrary, current representatives of the Kuomintang in the Legislative Yuan and the People's Political Council were not included in the list of candidates because they did not have such a backer. If such malpractices are not corrected, they will have an extremely bad impact on the Kuomintang. After meeting with Chairman Chiang, a Kuomintang representative told reporters that the chairman promised to correct this during the nomination of candidates for the Legislative Yuan so that those with high moral character and prestige can be included.

### Dewey Urges Emergency Aid to China; Calls on U.S. to Explore Bipolar Containment Policy

[Associated Press, New York, 24th] New York Governor Dewey on the 4th called on the government to explore a bipartisan containment diplomatic policy, saying: Only a small amount of emergency aid of one hundred million could save a free China.

[United Press, New York, 24th] Republican New York Governor Dewey, speaking tonight at a reunion of graduates of the Columbia University Law School, said: The US government has gone bankrupt by pivoting on China policy, and if China is not aided, its 450 million freedom-loving people may fall into Communist hands. The United States and other countries opposed to dictatorship are now under attack in various ways, but have not yet gone to war. The Communist conquest of the world controlling the freedom-loving nations, the largest of which is China, is progressing very quickly. The original "cold war" has turned into a "hot war" in Europe, and is getting even hotter and getting closer to hand in China. In this critical world, we must do something. It would be inconceivable for us to say that after winning the war, we will hand over the fruits of victory and allow free nations to fall into economic disarray and accept Soviet control. But if 275 million people in Western Europe are important, then in my view, the 450 million people in China are also extremely important. The President's emergency aid plan to Congress last Monday did not mention China at all, which was a great disappointment to me. This is completely unimaginable in the midst of a crisis that is about to lose a free China.

Dewey advocated including an emergency aid of US$75 million to $100 million to China in the temporary relief bill for Europe currently being discussed in Congress. Aid to China had been considered for three or four years, with annual aid of $250 million to maintain China's economic life so that it could engage with the Communists. Army surplus material from the Pacific should also be transported to China for relief. Dewey also acknowledged that the current government of China may have unsatisfactory aspects, but said that the government is also fighting alongside us on the side of human freedom against brutal dictatorship. Dewey concluded by saying that if China falls, all of Asia will be lost, and at that time Western Europe and North and South America will inevitably be helpless in an environment where the whole world is the enemy.

### Truman Did Not Mention Aid to China, Vandenberg Expresses Regret

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, revealed while speaking in the Senate on President Truman's proposed emergency aid bill to Europe that the State Department will soon submit a separate aid plan to China to Congress and expressed regret that the plan proposed by President Truman did not request aid to China.

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] Three Republican senators quickly expanded the United States' foreign aid program to include Asia. Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriation Subcommittee, warned that the emergency aid program to Europe should be consistent with needs elsewhere and that Asia should also be included. Senator Vandenberg said that post-war restoration plans should be extended to other countries, including those that have been disarmed for a long time. Senator Morse told the Senate that aiding the world, including the people of Europe and Asia, is the only hope, "We cannot focus all our attention on Europe and allow the Communists to encircle the Pacific. The situation in China is dire, and the law has failed. In order to expand international justice and protect national interests, it is necessary to aid the Far East countries. China, the Philippines, and Korea have shouldered the heavy burden of war when we were fully engaged in war in Europe and are in urgent need of aid today. The importance of the Soviet Union is the same in Europe and Asia, and it is time for the government to make clear its attitude towards Asia."

The United Kingdom proposed to decide the status of the Korean delegation this afternoon and passed it with eight votes to zero. At the afternoon meeting, chaired by Jiang Tingfu, it was unanimously passed to request the United Nations Economic and Social Council to allow New Zealand to join the Far Eastern Economic Commission as a member state. It also allowed four auxiliary members, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Malaya (including the Malay Federation, Singapore, North Borneo, Brunei, and Sarawak) to attend the meeting, but without voting rights. The meeting on the 26th will consider the applications for auxiliary membership submitted by France for Cambodia and Laos.

### The Korean Representative's Attendance Issue: Soviet Opposition Rejected

[United Press International, Baguio, 25th] The second conference of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, on the 25th, discussed the Soviet representative Mr. Stetsenko's proposal to exclude the issue of the commission's relationship with Korea from the agenda. The proposal was rejected by a vote of nine to two. The representative from Korea was not allowed to participate in the vote, pending a decision on whether the committee would recognize the new government of that country. Another Soviet proposal, which argued that the issue of the commission's relationship with a certain country's commissioner's office in Southeast Asia should be excluded from the agenda, was also rejected by the same vote. In addition, the Soviet proposal that the note from MacArthur's headquarters regarding Japan's economic policy should be excluded from the agenda was passed unanimously. Chairman Chiang Ting-fu then announced that the issue of inviting a representative from Korea to attend would remain on the agenda, but the committee could revise it at any time.

The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its second conference in Baguio, Philippines, on the 24th. Representatives from ten countries, including China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, India, and Australia, have all arrived in the Philippines. Mr. Vauven, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Social and Economic Council, also traveled from the United States to the Philippines to preside over the opening ceremony. Philippine President Roxas, in his capacity as host, first welcomed the representatives of various countries and called on all countries not to neglect Asia and the Far East. He solemnly stated that the people of Asia should receive international assistance to establish a sound industry, thereby promoting the happiness and prosperity of all mankind. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Conference, namely our Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu, delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of Asian economic problems, recognizing this as the root of all problems, and taking the eradication of the basic causes of poverty as the urgent task of Asian countries. At the same time, he pointed out that within the Asian region, no country can benefit from the poverty of other countries, but the prosperity of any country is enough to benefit all other countries. The speeches of Roxas and Chiang can be regarded as the common voice of the Asian people. They are worthy of attention from wealthy countries, especially the United States, which is hesitant to provide aid to Europe and Asia. They should pay special attention to this call from the depths of the hearts of the Asian people!

Although the main purpose of establishing the Economic Commission for the Far East is to focus on economic aspects and is not a kind of international conference with political functions, its task is only to: 1. Increase the production capacity of various countries in the Asia and Far East region: 2. Improve the living standards of the people of various countries in the Asia and Far East region: 3. Seek economic cooperation between countries in the Asia and Far East region and economic cooperation between this region and other regions of the world. But its ultimate role is not limited to the economic aspect, but also has a very important impact on politics. Because in today's world, politics and economics are inseparable. Political stability often depends on the resolution of economic problems; conversely, economic stability also depends on political openness and progress: Therefore, we have always believed that the tasks undertaken by the Economic Commission for the Far East are very important. Looking back at the first conference of the Economic Commission for the Far East held in Shanghai, our country's government and people paid great attention to it. However, the nature of the first conference was a preparatory meeting, which only studied the economic losses suffered by various countries in Asia and the Far East during the war, in order to provide suggestions on how to restore the economic situation of those countries, thereby establishing normal economic relations between countries, and that was all. As for how to enable countries to seek stability from economic recovery? How to promote economic cooperation between countries in the Far East to seek the prosperity of the Far East? And how to strengthen the economic ties between the Far East region and other regions of the world? These are the main topics of this Far East Economic Conference. Therefore, we have particularly high expectations for this meeting.

Today, the countries in Asia and the Far East are all devastated and severely damaged after the war. Everywhere is full of tragic scenes. The sad faces of the Asian people can be imagined without any description. The representatives of ten countries are now in Baguio, Philippines, no different from being in a city of sorrow in Asia. Whether it is what the eyes see or what the ears hear, all are the situations of hardship and distress of the Asian people. Now that the Far East Economic Commission is committed to promoting economic cooperation among countries and seeking the prosperity of all countries, the most important thing is naturally that the representatives of the ten countries can face the reality of Asia, prescribe the right medicine, and provide practical and effective suggestions, so that all countries in Asia and the Far East can get out of the sea of suffering and step into the realm of revival and prosperity as soon as possible. We do not underestimate theories and plans, but we always feel that any high-sounding but unrealistic suggestions will not help the actual situation of countries in Asia and the Far East. Therefore, we have to boldly and frankly point out that in today's Asia and the Far East region, which is full of desolation, if we want to talk about economic recovery and prosperity but cannot get the full assistance of wealthy and powerful countries, then any perfect plan is no different from empty talk on paper and will never produce good results. This is an objective fact that cannot be controlled by subjective opinions. We do not intend to make the countries in Asia and the Far East dependent on the economic assistance of wealthy countries, but the cruel war destroyed the material conditions of the countries in Asia and the Far East, making them in need of external assistance.

We believe that the responsible authorities in the United States have long had the same understanding of the situation of various countries in the world after the war, whether they are European countries or Asian countries. President Truman, seeing the economic crisis in European countries in April and May of this year, in order to prevent them from collapsing, specifically proposed to Congress a plan to provide economic assistance to European countries: Later, because Congress was hesitant to make a decision, and the economic situation of European countries was getting worse and worse, President Truman had to convene a special session of Congress so that Secretary of State Marshall's emergency aid plan for Europe could be passed as soon as possible, implemented as soon as possible, and alleviate the suffering of the European people as soon as possible. This generous spirit of the United States is worthy of our admiration and praise. However, the US authorities are well aware that the economic situation in Asia is also very critical, and its extent even exceeds that of Europe. The Asian people who are struggling and groaning on the hunger line are a hundred times or a thousand times more than the European people. However, the US authorities still turn a blind eye and remain indifferent. So far, there has been no discussion of a plan to provide economic assistance to Asia. The US government and the public may use the theory of "Europe First" to explain this, but we want to tell the US government and the public that since the foundation of the US domestic prosperity is completely based on overseas markets, they must understand that there is no such thing as "the world is poor but I am rich" in the US economy. If the countries in Asia continue to struggle in hardship for a long time, and the United States does not provide economic assistance in time, then the productivity of the countries in Asia will not be able to increase, and the living standards of the people will not be able to improve. To talk about international economic cooperation is like a fool talking in his sleep. Even if the Economic Commission for the Far East holds meetings from time to time and passes many nice-sounding plans, it will be in vain and will not solve the economic problems of the Far East.

In short, what the poor Asian countries urgently need today is not empty plans, nor is it the beautiful and moving speeches of diplomats, but material assistance and technical cooperation. First, let them recuperate and restore their vitality, and then they can take a further step to seek the industrial modernization of their industries and jointly seek the stability and prosperity of the world economy. This task requires the United Nations organization to make its greatest efforts to complete it; but we ultimately hope that the political diplomats of the United States will broaden their horizons, not ignore the importance of the countries of Asia, and be able to expand the aid plan for Europe to Asia? To jointly seek the revival of Europe and Asia. In recent days, the leaders of the US Republican Party have been giving speeches to the people everywhere, all talking about aiding Asia and China, which shows that the call of the Asian people has not only won the sympathy of the American people, but has also aroused the resonance of some American politicians. May the US authorities pay special attention to the call of the Asian people!

### Vessels Looted by Japan to be Returned to China by the End of the Year; Two Factories to be Shipped at the Same Time

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] News on the 25th: Two Chinese factories and five ships (including a 10,000-ton oil tanker) looted by Japan during the war have recently been found in Japan and will be returned to China by the end of the year. In addition, four of the nine national treasures, including a valuable Han Dynasty Yellow Dragon Plate map version in 188 boxes, and 14,817 ancient books, will also be returned when transportation is convenient. Among the factories to be returned is the complete equipment of the Tianjin Sanjia Board Company, which was looted from Tianjin in 1944. There is also property from the Shanghai Parker Davis Pharmaceutical Factory. The company's machines include: one pill-making machine, one electric drying machine, four sugar-coating pots, one copper steam pot, one filter press, and six mixing wheels. The machines in the two factories are in good condition, except for a few lost parts. Among the five ships to be returned is the 10,000-ton oil tanker "Hainan," which was confiscated by our government near Hainan Island from Japanese property after Japan surrendered. The ship was temporarily used for the purpose of repatriating Japanese, and after repeated negotiations, the Allied Headquarters finally decided to return it to China. The ship is currently docked in Nagasaki and is no longer navigable. It is expected that our country will send a tugboat next month to tow it to Shanghai for repairs. The other four ships are: the 2,080-ton "Eldorado," the 1,946-ton "Mao Li," the 2,000-ton "Hai Wen," and the 1,000-ton "He Xing" (all four ship names are translated). The last two ships were sunk by the Japanese after the surrender, and a maritime survey team will be dispatched to investigate whether the two ships can be floated.

### Jilin Temporary Council Questions Provincial Affairs

Resolution to Investigate the Reason for the Fall of Shijiazhuang

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The Jilin Temporary Council continued its meeting on the morning of the 25th. After Jilin Provincial Government Secretary-General Zhang Aisong gave a general report on provincial affairs, council members raised questions one after another, focusing on thoroughly investigating corruption and seeking the development of provincial affairs. The main points are as follows: Several commissioners, directors, and county heads who were reported and removed from office for investigation have not had any results, and corrupt officials are still at large. Does the provincial authorities have the determination and plan to develop provincial affairs? How to ensure the safety of major strongholds such as Pingjinbao? The provincial government is nominally located in Baoding, but it actually operates in three places: Ping, Bao, and Fengtai, which disperses administrative efficiency. The day after Shijiazhuang fell, various departments of the provincial government moved to Ping, causing panic, and the Supervisory Council also took refuge in Beiping. There is no overall plan for the provincial government to mobilize to suppress the rebellion. Not only has it not prohibited apportionments, but it has intensified them. Simplification of institutions has not been implemented. A certain council member pointed out the situation of the provincial government's accounting director appointing personal friends, saying that his great aunt is his confidential commissioner and section chief, and his second aunt, Yin, and the commissioner's wife handle general affairs. In addition, there are also problems such as Tangshan refugees still sleeping in single clothes in this severe winter, and the administrative power of mining supervision. The questioning continued in the afternoon. After the provincial government secretary-general gave a general response, Civil Affairs Director Sun Zhenbang reported, emphasizing the achievements of local teams, saying that in terms of work style, it has been decided to designate the 11th commissioner district in the Pingjinbao triangle area as a model innovation area, pay attention to military force, and appoint county heads regardless of qualifications, only asking whether they are competent, and implement new methods to solve the land problem. The meeting also passed a resolution to send telegrams to Chairman Chiang and the soldiers who are suppressing the rebellion to express their respect. In addition, representatives of refugees who escaped from Shijiazhuang went to petition, and it was decided to discuss with the provincial government to allocate funds for relief and to thoroughly study the reasons for the fall of Shijiazhuang based on the refugees' reports.

### Jilin Provincial Government Allocates 50 Billion to Handle Post-Fall Affairs in Shijiazhuang

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Jilin Provincial Government Secretary-General reported at the Temporary Council that the Jilin Provincial Government has a plan to develop provincial affairs and will greatly increase local military force. In order to handle the post-fall affairs in Shijiazhuang, the provincial government has allocated 50 billion in emergency measures funds and another 1 billion to reserve grain for public students in Baoding for use in times of emergency.

### Ping-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises More Than Double, Prices Soar

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Today, the Shanghai exchange rate suddenly jumped more than double, generally exceeding 100 yuan. Yesterday, the opening price of each bank in the city was still more than 50 yuan. Today, as Tianjin reported a rise, the Ping market rose accordingly. The two sides agreed to trade at 80 yuan. From 11:00 to 12:00, Tianjin rose again, and the Ping market jumped to 100 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 110 yuan, more than double the price this morning. The Central Bank's Shanghai exchange rate of 45 yuan could not be maintained in the market. The sudden rise in the Shanghai exchange rate was due to the fact that the foreign exchange price of each bank in Shanghai was smaller than that of Pingjin. The price increase in Ping was too great in two days, and the gap with Shanghai was too large. For example, the price of naval ship flour was 470,000 in Ping, but only 262,000 in Shanghai, which encouraged a large flow of funds to the south. In addition, the prices in Ping are still soaring today. Some stores are shouting 500,000 for first-class local bagged flour, 9,400 for a catty of rice, 1.24 million for Wufu, and 56 million for 42-count yarn. The price of gold and US dollars has also risen sharply.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 25th] After the fall of the factory gate, prices in Tianjin suddenly rose. Recently, the situation has become even worse. A large amount of speculative capital is engaging in purchases through the grain industry. On the 25th, a small bag of flour broke the 400,000 yuan mark. The municipal authorities took emergency measures on the 25th to investigate and confiscate black market hoarding.

### Grain Prices Rise Consistently in Guangzhou, Qingdao, and Xi'an

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] The price of rice here soared to 860,000 yuan per dan today, and people are restless. The authorities are working hard to stabilize it.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 25th] The price of naval ship flour in Qingdao has also hit the 400,000 yuan mark again. White rice on Nanlu Road costs 1 million per 100 catties. Today's new grain prices have risen by 10% compared to last week.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 25th] The black market price of gold soared on the 25th, stimulating a consistent rise in yarn and other prices. The price of white rice has exceeded 900,000 per dan, and the price of flour is 300,000 per bag.

### Yarn Prices in Chongqing Trend Downward

### Measures for Grain Circulation Will Be Implemented Immediately in Six Provinces and Four Cities

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan has recently formulated measures for grain circulation and decided to implement them immediately in six provinces - Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan - and four cities - Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Chongqing. The full text is as follows:

Article 1: These measures are specifically formulated in accordance with the Outline for the Implementation of Constitutional Government for the Completion of the Mobilization to Suppress Rebellion for the management of grain circulation.

The area of implementation of these measures is temporarily limited to the six provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan in the Yangtze River basin and the four cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Chongqing.

The grain referred to in these measures includes four types: rice, wheat, and flour.

Article 2: Grain in the provinces along the Yangtze River should be freely circulated. Those who transport it out of the Yangtze River estuary must obtain approval from the Ministry of Food and be inspected by customs.

Article 3: For the transportation of grain out of the Yangtze River estuary, legal grain merchants should report the types and quantities of grain, the region of purchase to the final destination, and submit the grain merchant's license (or a photograph of the license). After obtaining approval from the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Food will notify the local government of the purchase location and inform the local Grain Association.

The maximum amount of grain that each grain merchant can report for transportation each time is limited to 5,000 shi of rice, 10,000 shi of grains, and 3,000 shi of wheat. However, they are not allowed to purchase the aforementioned approved grain for transportation in Shanghai and Nanjing. The merchant should report to the Ministry of Food for approval of the transportation permit before loading.

Article 5: The transport of flour out of the Yangtze River estuary from various provinces and cities along the Yangtze River will be subject to a quota system. The Ministry of Food will approve the quota each month. If a guild has been established, the Ministry of Food will comprehensively approve the quota based on the total production of the area, and the guild will allocate it proportionally to each factory that has started operation. A detailed list of the factory name, trademark (or brand name), allocation amount, and the destination of each factory should be submitted in five copies to the Ministry of Food for approval.

When legitimate grain merchants report the transportation of flour, they should purchase it from the factory within the allocation amount of each factory. The factory must not raise prices or sell it to brokers.

Article 4: Manufacturers of the Fourth District Flour Industry Association who have opened factories outside the implementation area are not subject to these measures.

Article 6: When the Ministry of Food receives the flour allocation list from the various district guilds, it should approve the transportation permit according to the factory, stating the flour trademark (or brand name), the amount of transportation, the origin and destination, and send the original list to the Ministry of Finance and directly notify the relevant customs for inspection.

Article 7: The transportation permit issued by the Ministry of Food is valid for one month from the date of issuance. Those who fail to ship the goods within the time limit will be deemed invalid.

Article 8: All government agencies that purchase grain in the implementation area to transport it out of the Yangtze River estuary should first report the types, quantities, and uses to the Ministry of Food for approval, and the Ministry of Food will designate the area for purchase.

Article 9: All ships carrying grain should check the transportation permit issued by the Ministry of Food to verify that the origin and destination and the type and quantity of grain are consistent. This transportation permit should be carried with the manifest (if it is flour, it must be accompanied by a tax payment certificate) for customs inspection and release.

Article 10: If the customs discovers grain that has been transported out of the Yangtze River estuary without the approval of the Ministry of Food, it will be treated as smuggling, handled in accordance with the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations, and the seized grain will be handed over to the local grain authority for temporary storage.

Article 11: The Ministry of Food may organize a review committee to handle the review of reports for transportation. The organizational regulations will be determined separately.

Article 12: These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Has Not Yet Been Decided, Bevin Presides Over the Opening Ceremony, the Eve of the Conference is Full of Harmonious Atmosphere

[News From Our Newspaper] London, 25th, Broadcast: The sixth session of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will be inaugurated here at Lancaster House at 3:30 PM today (Greenwich Time, 11:30 PM Shanghai Time), and the opening ceremony will be hosted by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. The primary task of this conference is to discuss the Austrian peace treaty. The United Kingdom and the United States seem to be adopting a more moderate attitude in order to reduce the fierce dispute between the East and West. The first issue to be resolved at the conference is the agenda issue, as the representatives of the four major powers have failed to reach an agreement on this issue.

[Reuters, London, 25th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference, which is related to the "Fate of Europe," opened today. When U.S. Secretary of State Marshall arrived at the venue, the crowd cheered. Mr. Marshall and his entourage arrived at the conference earliest and were in very good spirits. He told reporters, "I am very confident at the moment." Molotov was also cheered by the crowd. Bevin and Bidault arrived almost simultaneously and walked into the venue side by side. Reporters were not able to listen in at the venue, and the details of the first meeting are yet to be released.

[News From Our Newspaper] London, 25th, Broadcast: After the foreign ministers of the four countries arrived at the venue one after another, the military commanders of the British, American, and Soviet occupation zones in Germany, General Robertson, General Clay, and Marshal Sokolovsky, also arrived one by one. Clay was in casual clothes. Clay's political advisor, Murphy, accompanied him.

[United Press, London, 25th] British officials announced today that Foreign Secretary Bevin had a very pleasant meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last night. Both sides acknowledged that the unity of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is extremely important not only for Germany and Austria, but also for the future of the world. Bevin will follow the established policy of drawing the United States and the Soviet Union closer together, and his attitude will be more moderate than that of U.S. Secretary of State Marshall. Bevin also visited and met with Mr. Marshall last night. Security has been increased around the venue, and all idlers are subject to close surveillance or questioning.

[Reuters, London, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Marshall and Molotov on the night of the 24th in an attempt to resolve the difficulties regarding the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Foreign Minister Bidault immediately joined the talks after arriving in London yesterday. The scope, procedure, and timing of the conference are still unknown to outsiders. Because the foreign ministers' representatives have failed to agree on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held without an agenda. Although the agenda has not been set, the tasks of the Foreign Ministers' Conference should be to determine whether Germany will continue to be governed under the control of the four powers, or whether it will be split into two countries politically or economically; if the Foreign Ministers' Conference fails, to prevent the deepening of the division of Europe, to adjust the relations between the powers, and to determine whether to grant Austria independence and sovereignty after the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty. The crux of the German problem lies in the Soviet Union's request to extract production from Western Germany as compensation, and the Soviet Union's request to co-manage the Ruhr. The crux of the Austrian problem lies in the German assets in Austria. Observers believe that it is not impossible for the powers to make concessions to each other regarding German assets in Austria, so it is expected that the London Conference will at least be able to sign the Austrian peace treaty.

[United Press, London, 25th] Judging from the mood in the hours before the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin are still strongly opposed to the Soviet Union's demands regarding Germany's political economy and compensation. French Foreign Minister Bidault is in a difficult situation due to domestic unrest. The U.S. delegation suspects that the French Communist Party is deliberately making things difficult for him. The French delegation said that Bidault intends to align French policy with that of the United Kingdom and the United States and wait to see what initiative Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will take in order to achieve some practical results at this conference. The composition of the conference has therefore become a three-to-one situation, just like the Moscow Conference.

### Various Parties Express Concern About the Future of US-Soviet Relations

[News From Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 25th, Broadcast: As the United Nations General Assembly is about to end, representatives from various countries are expressing pessimism about the future of US-Soviet relations as they pack their bags. Optimists are as rare as missionaries are easy to find in a gambling game. A few optimists are focusing their attention on the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, believing that Secretary of State Marshall will ignore the advice of Hoover and Burnes and strive to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union. The American people are expressing great concern about the future of the United States and the Soviet Union. Dr. Bowles, chairman of the American Medical Association, is deeply worried and suggests that every American city should immediately prepare for atomic bomb warfare and take steps to ensure that those injured by atomic bombs can receive medical treatment. Rabbi Wise, chairman of the World Jewish Congress, asked President Truman, Stalin, and Attlee to immediately hold a three-power conference and clearly declare that a third world war will never happen.

### German Reporters Interview at the London Conference

[United Press, London, 25th] There are about 100 news reporters, photographers, and radio broadcasters from all over the world interviewing at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, including German reporters, which is the first time since the war.

### Safety First on the German Question, France's Position Remains Unchanged, Ruhr Internationalization Separated From Germany

[United Press, Paris, 24th] At the London Conference, France may request political unification under the German federal system, and put forward four major conditions: Germany must be strictly monitored to ensure that it will never again be a threat to France. France must ensure that it receives a sufficient supply of coal from the Ruhr area to complete its reconstruction before Germany. The flexible agreement established by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States at the Moscow Conference this spring is far from meeting France's requirements. The Saar region, where important coal mines are located, must be incorporated into the French economic sphere. France has set up customs checkpoints along the Saar and German borders and replaced the old Saar mark with the French franc. The industrial center of Germany, the Ruhr region, and the west bank of the Rhine River must be separated from the German mainland, and the Ruhr region must be internationalized. The Rhine region should be occupied by Allied forces to guide its self-determination.

Bidault and his advisors have focused on the Ruhr issue, believing that this is Germany's arsenal, and France must use this as a guard post in order to obtain sufficient security. France advocates long-term monitoring of Germany and supports the 40-year disarmament plan proposed by the United States. France is prepared to oppose the Soviet Union's sudden proposal for a comprehensive and immediate withdrawal of occupying forces, believing that the presence of troops is, if not the only way to obtain Germany's peaceful promise, at least the most appropriate way.

### Austrian Foreign Minister's Speech

Foreign Property in Austria Should Be Subject to Austrian Law

[Reuters, London, 24th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber told reporters in London that the Austrian government is determined not to agree to a treaty that does not have the possibility of a peaceful resolution or that makes it impossible for Austria to exercise sovereignty over its own economy. After the Four-Power Committee on the Austrian Treaty set up by the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference met in Vienna, it was already familiar with the main points. There are four points in the Soviet Union's proposal that are contrary to the basic attitude of the Austrian government, namely: the Soviet Union receives German funds in Austria and does not simultaneously receive the debts and other obligations attached to German funds; the German assets received by the Soviet Union must not be nationalized by Austria in the future; the Austrian government must not prevent the transfer of German property interest to the Soviet Union; when disputes arise in the implementation of the agreement on German property, the Austrian government should negotiate directly with the relevant country. Gruber stated that the basic attitude of the Austrian government is that all foreign property in Austria should be subject to Austrian law.

[United Press, Vienna, 24th] Austrian President Renner issued a declaration today urging the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty and the withdrawal of 100,000 occupying troops from the country. It is said that Austria neither hopes nor wants to become the focus of international relations.

### President Truman Reports to Congress on the Distribution of Relief Bill Funds, China Receives US$27.7 Million

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 24th] President Truman reported to Congress today that since Congress allocated US$332 million for the U.S. foreign relief plan on July 30 of this year, as of the end of October, the remaining funds in the budget were only US$24,766,886. Expenditures approved as of October, including costs, insurance, and freight, are listed as follows: Austria: US$88,639,146; China: US$27,700,000; Greece: US$38,731,747; Italy: US$121,296,678; Trieste: US$9,765,943; International Children's Emergency Fund: US$15 million; Voluntary Relief Association Transportation Fund: US$5 million; Administrative Expenses (State Department): US$600,000; Citizens Food Committee: US$500,000.

### Frequent Meetings Held by the French Cabinet to Discuss Countermeasures Against Labor Unrest; National Transportation Paralyzed

[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The Schumann cabinet is scheduled to hold a full cabinet meeting on the morning of the 26th to decide on economic and political policies to stem the nationwide labor unrest involving millions of workers. After reaching an agreement, the government will immediately meet with a delegation from the General Confederation of Labor, which had requested Premier Schumann for "the earliest possible meeting."

[United Press, Paris, 25th] A strike by over 1.2 million workers under Communist leadership has brought almost all French industry to a standstill. The newly occurring strike of transportation workers is virtually isolating France from the outside world. Partial strikes by telephone workers and others were already underway when the General Confederation of Labor ordered a complete strike. The railway workers' strike has forced trains to stop running, and ship traffic has been reduced to a minimum, as all ports are blockaded by the Communists. Coal mines and most important industries have come to a halt. Winter rains in Paris and elsewhere have deepened the mood of unrest and misery in France.

[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] The number of striking workers in France has reached one million today. Premier Schumann has decided to take strong measures to prevent the expansion of labor unrest while also preparing to make possible concessions to the workers' demands. However, the government has not yet announced how it will deal with the labor unrest. When asked if the government would take over the railways and other striking industries, the answer was that it was possible. Government sources also said that Premier Schumann might accept the workers' demands to increase the minimum wage from 7,000 francs per month to 10,800 francs, but only on the condition of an immediate return to work. However, the General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the Communist Party, is demanding an immediate 25% increase in wages pending negotiations to adjust wages, which is almost impossible to grant.

### British Soldiers Petition Soviet Foreign Minister to Release Wives and Children Held in the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, London, 24th] Twelve British soldiers who married Russian women during the war have launched a "Petition to Molotov" movement to get the Soviet Union to release their wives and children to come to Britain. The soldiers took a booklet to the embassy yesterday and left it, as Molotov had scheduled a meeting to explain why the wives of British soldiers were not being issued exit passports. Meanwhile, British Under-Secretary of State Mayhew stated in the House of Commons that the Soviet Union's attempt to retain the wives of British soldiers under the pretext of preventing Soviet citizens and orphans in the British occupation zone of Germany from being dispersed was highly unusual. The current UN General Assembly approved the admission of Yemen and Pakistan to the United Nations. The fourth person from the left in the Yemen delegation is Chief Delegate Prince Abdullah.

### US Postmaster General Hannegan Resigns

Donaldson to be promoted to Postmaster General

[Our Newspaper] New York, 25th, Broadcast: Washington News, the White House announced today that Postmaster General Hannegan has submitted his resignation, which has been approved. The President will appoint First Deputy Postmaster General Donaldson as the new Postmaster General.

### Stassen Campaigns, Announces Political Platform

Maintain Free Economy, Avoid War

[United Press, Milwaukee, 24th] Stassen officially launched his 1948 Republican presidential campaign on the 24th, attacking other figures in the Republican Party who might be nominated as presidential candidates. He criticized New York Governor Dewey's silence and declared that, if he were President, he would strive to achieve two supreme goals: to achieve a steadily improving life for himself and others, avoid boom and bust cycles, and strive to maintain a free economy; to achieve greater individual freedom for Americans and all mankind, and to avoid the tragedy of a third world war. Stassen said: If he were to become President, he would constantly declare to all nations that they need not fear American aggression, but that if they committed acts of aggression, they would have reason to fear American counteraction. We will never pursue a policy of appeasement towards any nation.

### Hurley to Run for Senator

[Associated Press, Santa Fe, New Mexico, 24th] Former US Ambassador to China Hurley announced today that he would announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for Senator from New Mexico in due course to oppose Democrat Hatch. Hurley was nominated by the Republicans in the last election but was defeated by Democratic Senator Chavez.

### US Food Aid to the Far East Considered Too Little by Bretton

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th, United Press] US Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Leledgeis stated that the committee was unaware of the State Department's recommendations for allocating food to alleviate famine problems in China, India, and other Asian countries. The amount of food we have shipped to these countries so far is very small compared to that shipped to Europe.

### New Plan to Dissolve Japanese Zaibatsu; US Suddenly Requests Extension for Discussion

[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] According to official sources today, the United States has requested the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission to extend the discussion on the second phase of the plan to dissolve the Japanese zaibatsu. This plan was originally proposed by the United States several weeks ago, and its contents have not yet been made public. It is understood that the United States intends to revise it to reduce its scope. At today's meeting of the Far Eastern Commission, the US representative stated that the State Department intends to slightly revise the wording and certain technical aspects of the proposal and requested that the discussion be postponed. In recent weeks, US economic policy towards Japan has been criticized by some business circles in the United States, who believe that the dissolution of the Japanese zaibatsu would promote socialism in Japan and make the Japanese commercial situation unfavorable to both Japan and foreign countries doing business with it.

### Japanese Cabinet Suffers Major Blow; Committee on Industry and Mining Overturns Coal Mining Bill; Government and Three Parties Accuse Liberal Party of Making Trouble Unreasonably

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Katayama Cabinet suffered its first blow on the afternoon of the 25th when its Coal Mining National Control Bill was overturned by the Committee on Industry and Mining before it was even submitted to the parliament for discussion. At the committee meeting this afternoon, only nine of the 29 members present voted in favor.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The three parties of the Japanese Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties, finding that the Diet had fallen into chaos due to the Liberal Party's disruption, sought to counterattack strongly. Last night, they issued an emergency statement, placing the responsibility for the current political turmoil entirely on the Liberal Party.

The statement stated in part: In the past two or three days, the Liberal Party has been unreasonably disruptive in the Diet, deliberately hindering the proceedings of the Diet, completely disregarding the spirit of a democratic Diet. The government and the three parties have made the greatest concessions and have made the greatest efforts. The coal mining nationalization bill was also put forward at the meeting on the 24th as a final compromise, but it was still rejected by the Liberal Party, and the Diet's proceedings were thus brought to a standstill. In this situation, the three parties are truly helpless and are making the facts public to the people.

Speaker of the House Avoids Meeting

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The plenary session of the House of Representatives opened at 7:55 PM on the 24th amidst a storm of roaring, with Vice Speaker Tanaka Man-itsu, from the Democratic Party, sitting in the Speaker's chair, and no sign of Speaker Matsuoka Komakichi, who had become a problematic figure. The Liberal Party had prepared to submit a motion of no confidence in the Speaker, while the Democratic Party wanted to submit a motion of confidence in the Speaker first. A fierce dispute broke out between the government party and the opposition party. As of 8:50 PM, no room for compromise had been found, and the meeting never got on track, presenting an unprecedented state of chaos since the Diet opened.

### Evidence of Matsui's Crimes is Conclusive

Far East Tribunal Presents Evidence

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th, Special Dispatch] According to the evidence presented by the International Military Tribunal this afternoon, Matsui Iwane, accused of being responsible for the "Nanjing Massacre," authored several inflammatory essays in 1941, advocating for war against the United States before it was ready. It is said that Matsui, the former commander of the Japanese Central China Expeditionary Force, worked to prevent the success of the US-Japan negotiations in 1941. The court presented several essays showing that Matsui identified the United States, Britain, and several "democratic countries" as Japan's current enemies. Matsui also stated in his essays, "I absolutely oppose any compromise with the United States." He also called "attempting to resolve the war against China" an absurd mistake. In his July 1941 essay, Matsui stated that if the United States declared war on Germany in the short term, Japan should fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact and resolutely declare war. Matsui's essay also stated that the United States was "neither prepared nor capable of engaging in two-front warfare." The true intention of the United States was to "deceive Japan" and prolong negotiations so that it could gain time to prepare for war.

### US-Soviet Trade Largely Balanced

More Soviet Goods Exported to US

[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] According to figures from the Department of Commerce, US-Soviet trade in the third quarter of this year was largely balanced. US exports to the Soviet Union were worth $23 million, while US imports from the Soviet Union were $27 million. Most of the imports were fur, chromium, and magnesium ore, tobacco, and cotton ginning machines, while the main exports were various machinery and metal products.

### International Trade Conference

China Appointed Vice-Chairman of General Committee

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] The International Trade Organization Conference in Havana has selected Britain, France, and the United States as Vice-Chairmen of the General Committee, which will guide the work of the conference.

### Canadian Government Announces Food Price Controls Will Be Reinstated

[Associated Press, Ottawa, 24th] The Canadian government announced today that food price controls will be reinstated.

### Arab Proposal to Unify Holy Land Rejected by UN Committee; US-Soviet Partition Plan Likely to Pass

[United Press, Lake Success, 24th] In the first test vote on the future of the Holy Land, the United Nations today rejected the Arab demand that the International Court of Justice decide whether the United Nations has the legal authority to decide the future of Palestine. Following this vote, there will be a series of votes to decide on numerous motions and amendments, so that the Palestine Committee can submit its final decision to the General Assembly. The first part of the Arab proposal was rejected by a vote of 25 to 18, with 11 abstentions. Another part of the Arab proposal, which called for the International Court of Justice to determine not only whether the United Nations had the power to decide, but also whether the United Nations had the ability to implement the partition plan, was rejected by a vote of 20 to 21, with 13 abstentions. The committee also approved an Arab proposal by a vote of 17 to 14, with 25 abstentions, calling on all countries to repatriate and resettle their Jewish refugees and help them settle down and find employment. Subsequently, the committee rejected the Arab proposal to establish a special committee to determine the number of Jewish refugees that member states should absorb, by a vote of 18 to 18, with 22 abstentions. The committee then defeated the Arab proposal to immediately create a "single independent" Palestinian state by a vote of 29 to 12, with 14 abstentions.

### Humorous Invalid Ballots: "Su Wu the Great Baboon" Unclear Whom It Alludes To

[Our Newspaper] In this professional association election ballot counting, as of yesterday, only the Certified Public Accountants Association had no invalid ballots among the ten associations that had been counted, the rest had more or less invalid ballots. However, unlike the regional election ballots, which were invalidated due to writing errors, most of them were invalidated due to elegance or teasing. For example, one ballot in the industrial and mining association wrote "Celebrate Invalid Ballot," one ballot in the labor union wrote "Great Baboon," and one ballot in the bar association even had the words "Su Wu." There is no such name among the candidates, and it is unknown what its intention is. Others added the words "I vote" for so-and-so "one vote" on the candidate's name and attached fingerprints, which was too solemn and backfired. In the education association, Zhang Yi's vote was invalidated because he wrote "Zhang Yousan" (Zhang Yi's pseudonym).

### Repeated Impersonation of Soldiers to Rob Car Drivers; Two Criminals Captured Inside the Great World, Confessing to the Stolen Goods at First Sight; Admitting to a Total of Fourteen Cases

[Our Dispatch] Since the 12th of this month until the night before last, there have been more than ten continuous cases in this city of impersonating soldiers to deceive and rob outbound cars, and to loot drivers' belongings. The police authorities attach great importance to this and have issued special orders to the branch bureaus to investigate and crack down. After receiving the order, Shi, the director of the Lao Zha branch bureau, ordered section chief Jiang Shangpei to take action. On the one hand, he instructed the organization of a special search team, selecting capable officers Zhang Kuilian and Song Shaomei as leaders, to cooperate with all criminal police, volunteer police, and section chief Chen Jun'gan, etc., to form eight teams. Section chief Jiang summoned the victimized drivers from various car companies to the bureau to inquire in detail about the appearance, clothing, and any secret marks of the car-robbing bandits. At around 6 PM on the 19th, the search team, accompanied by the victims, began work and set out to various restaurants, dance halls, theaters, brothels, coffee shops, amusement parks, and other public places. A portion of the officers took cars to the Great Western Road, Victory Road, and the southern city, Zhabei, Jiangwan sister suburbs, searching any uniformed people encountered by hiring taxis.

Being Stubborn and Still Trying to Evade

At 10:30 PM the night before last, the search team went to the Great World's Da Jing Ban boxing arena. Two spectators were carefully identified by the victimized drivers as undoubtedly the fierce bandits who robbed cars. The police were then instructed to secretly monitor them. Before long, the bandits discovered this and went up to the second floor, intending to sneak out. At that time, officers Cui Zhiliang and others intercepted them. The two bandits refused to comply, saying, "We are soldiers. You police have no right to deal with us. Besides, we have not committed any crimes, so why are you stopping us from passing?" Their attitude was stubborn, and they attempted to resist with guns several times. Fortunately, the police officers were prepared, and they could not carry out their plan. They were then escorted to the accounting room downstairs. On the one hand, military police were summoned to the scene. The military police confiscated a left-handed gun and seven bullets from them, and also found a flashlight pen, handkerchief, American dollar coins, etc. They were then all taken to the Lao Zha branch bureau for strict interrogation. According to the confession, one was named Lu Wenbin, using the alias Jiang Quanrui, also known as Lu Yun, 26 years old, from Haimen, impersonating the captain of the 9th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Regiment Management District; the other was Jiang Xianfang, 21 years old, from Ningbo, using the alias Wu Hao, impersonating the platoon leader of the 1st Platoon of the 9th Company. They both flatly denied the car robbery cases.

Lowering Their Heads in Silence, Directly Admitting Without Denial

Later, the victim recognized that the "Jackct" (jacket) they were wearing had blue paint on the back, and that the flashlight pen, handkerchief, and other items they were carrying were all stolen goods.

As for all the guns, bullets, and symbols, they confessed to having stolen them from the division headquarters one after another.

Two bandits who specialize in robbing outbound cars have been arrested. On the right is Lu Wenbin, and on the left is Jiang Xianfang. (Photo by this newspaper)

### Yijing's Murder Case; District Court Continued Hearing Yesterday; Gu Weijun Denies Ever Going to the Wang's House

[Our Dispatch] The case of Line Police Gu Weijun of the Xujiahui Police Bureau, who was accused of shooting and killing resident Wang Wanshun on the evening of June 23 this year, was secretly continued yesterday morning in the Criminal Court One of the District Court by Judge Xie Zhiying. First, Gu Weijun was brought up, and his testimony was the same as last time. Then, Tang, a police officer from the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau, testified: At 2 AM on the 24th, he was ordered by the sub-bureau chief to go to Wang Wanshun's house, the scene of the incident, to investigate, and Gu Weijun guided him. Three bullet casings were found outside Wang's house, and no bullet strikes were found inside the door. He then returned to the bureau to report and handed over the bullet casings to the judicial section chief. Plainclothes policeman Huang Yiquan testified: After suppressing the riots at the Hongkou Theater on the evening of the 23rd, he escorted 1,000 troublemakers back to the sub-bureau. The sub-bureau chief led the way in front, and we escorted them in the rear. When we arrived near Wujiazhai, a young man chased after us and shouted, "My father has been beaten to death!" The sub-bureau chief asked who had beaten him, and he pointed to Gu and said, "It was him!" The sub-bureau chief took Gu's gun and inspected it, and found that three bullets were missing. He then ordered me to go to Wang's house to investigate. I went to Wang's house with a plainclothes policeman surnamed Li and saw an old man lying in a pool of blood, barely breathing. I immediately called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Just as I was closing the car door, people all around were noisy, and a dozen people came up and surrounded me. I was beaten on both my legs and back and slipped into the sun. I pulled out my self-defense gun and fired three shots into the sky. The crowd dispersed slightly, and I took a rickshaw and fled. Seeing that there were still several people chasing behind me, I fired three more warning shots, then two more shots for emphasis. After returning to the bureau to report, I went to the hospital for treatment, and I don't know anything else. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stood up and said: A bullet head was found inside the door of Wang's house and has been submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office and transferred to the District Court for inclusion in the file, which is sufficient to prove that Gu and others had fired shots inside the door. Questioning Gu Weijun, he still denied ever entering Wang's house, saying that "they dragged me in." The defendant's lawyer also said that the bullet head was .32 caliber, while the guns used by the Xujiahui sub-bureau were all .38 caliber, indicating that it was not related to the case. Finally, after Xu, Wang Wanshun's wife, and his son, Zhenxiong, testified, the court ruled that the case be retried on another date, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### Geese Fly Past Hengyang - Anti-Japanese War Memorial City - Dividing Line Between North and South

(Hengyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 20th) There is a line in ancient Chinese poetry that says, "Geese fly past Hengyang." Anyone who has been to Hengyang can truly feel the meaning of this line. Hengyang is an ancient city in southern Hunan, historically regarded as the dividing line between North and South China. Geese are birds of the cold regions. In autumn, the northern geese migrate south in search of food, stopping at Hengyang. Therefore, a small hill at the South Gate of Hengyang is named "Geese Returning Peak." Although this explanation may not be entirely reliable, as the northern geese do not necessarily stop only at Hengyang during their southward migration, the climate here is indeed similar to that of South China. Hengyang has no autumn; people wear light clothing on three sunny days and cotton-padded clothing on three rainy days. People accustomed to the climate of the southeastern coastal provinces find the climate in Hengyang somewhat abnormal.

Emerging During the War

Hengyang was not well-known before the war. It gradually prospered after the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was opened to traffic. During the war, it became a crossroads for highways, and after the Hunan-Guangxi Railway was opened to military traffic, it was the terminus. As a result, commerce flourished, and it was temporarily known as "Wartime Hankou," becoming a haven for adventurers. The small city of Hengyang had a population of over 800,000, and the market expanded to areas more than ten miles outside the old Hengyang city area. It was not only the only major city in Hunan, but also the only major commercial center in the rear during the war. Hengyang's status during the war in the minds of the Chinese people was no less than that of Guilin, Kunming, and Chongqing.

Also Being Destroyed During the War

Hengyang became a place of sudden wealth during the war, but it was also destroyed during the war. During the Hunan-Guangxi campaign in the thirty-second year of the Republic, Hengyang staged a 48-day defense, suffering intense artillery bombardment. Its losses were greater than those of any other city during the war, completely destroyed, leaving virtually nothing. Of the soldiers who directly fought, the entire Tenth Army had few remaining. More than 3,000 civilian laborers were buried in the hail of bullets, and over 300,000 people were either brutally killed by the enemy or died indirectly due to war-related diseases. More than 45,000 houses were burned, over 180 factories of various sizes were destroyed, over 370,000 mu of farmland were left uncultivated, and over 800 billion yuan worth of property was lost. After the victory and repatriation, entering Hengyang felt like entering a wasteland. Now, more than two years after the restoration, Hengyang still appears fragmented and dilapidated, with broken walls and weeds everywhere.

A Cemetery of Over 10,000 Heads

Because of the 48-day defense, Hengyang wrote the most glorious page in the history of our anti-Japanese war, and was thus named "Anti-Japanese War Memorial City." The only memorial in this memorial city is the Tenth Army Martyrs' Cemetery next to the Hunan-Guangxi Railway Station. This cemetery is built on Zhangjia Mountain, which was an entire regimental position during the battle of Hengyang. From the regimental commander down to the lowest-ranking soldiers, only one regimental adjutant was injured and carried back to the city alive. Everyone else heroically sacrificed themselves there. After the enemy occupied Chongyang, the loyal remains of this entire regiment were hastily buried in the trenches on the spot. In the spring of this year, after the restoration, General Ge Xiancai, commander of the Tenth Division of the Reserve Tenth Army, sent personnel to Hengyang to collect the loyal bones from the surrounding areas and built a cemetery on Zhangjia Mountain.

Due to limited funds, the cemetery is simple. All that is buried are fragmented remains, with not a single complete skeleton. Counting by skulls, there are more than 12,000. Although the tomb is closed, there are air vents around it. Peeking inside through the air vents, the white bones are clearly visible. This cemetery of over 12,000 skulls has not been valued by the government or local authorities. When you go to pay your respects, the desolation of the barren mountain and the sunken-eyed, collapsed-nosed skulls will evoke a long sigh, or even tears of sorrow!

A Memorial City That Lives Up to Its Name

Apart from the cemetery on Zhangjia Mountain, there is no other memorial in the Anti-Japanese War Memorial City. People who have not been to the memorial city assume that it must have neat and clean roads and modern buildings, making it one of the best model cities in the interior. Before arriving in this memorial city, the reporter also thought so, but upon arriving in Hengyang, the memorial city appeared to be a dirty and chaotic place with excrement everywhere.

Hengyang suffered another famine after the restoration, so its recovery has been particularly slow. Although it has established a municipality and has a municipal government, the municipal administration has achieved nothing. The main streets are full of piles of bricks and mud, the ditches are open, the sewage is black and foul, and the roads paved with yellow mud are muddy in the rain and dusty on sunny days. On the major thoroughfares, broken-down trucks are often parked on both sides, turning the wide roads into narrow paths that can only accommodate one person. On some roads, rain gathers into pools, and rickshaws run on the sidewalks. Cars driving on the streets of Hengyang have the appearance of amphibious vehicles. The new buildings on the main streets are uneven, some extending to the roadside and others set back, like jagged teeth, indicating that the construction of this city is all free-for-all.

However, this memorial city lives up to its name. High, dilapidated walls are everywhere, and the piles of bricks and mud on the roads resemble barricades used during street fighting. These things that should have been cleared long ago have not been cleared, undoubtedly preserving these war relics like preserving ancient relics, so that the citizens do not forget the suffering of the Anti-Japanese War. At the same time, it tells those who come to this memorial city for the first time that this is a truly worthy Anti-Japanese War Memorial City.

Fighting and Laissez-faire

The people of Hunan are strong, especially in western Hunan. Hengyang is in southern Hunan, so fighting is particularly prevalent. Three words disagree, fight first and talk later. The local government of Hengyang has the spirit of Lao Tzu's "laissez-faire," and has never strictly investigated a case of "fighting." Therefore, everyone regards "fighting" as the only way to resolve all disputes. From spring to now, there have been no less than a hundred incidents of "fighting" here, some of which have resulted in deaths. In the most recent incident, Yang Dazhan, a physical education teacher at Fushu Middle School, was beaten to death for refereeing a soccer game. The municipal government has still not been able to arrest the murderer. People in Hengyang are accustomed to this and do not think the case is particularly serious, but the sports community in Changsha is very angry. The day before yesterday, when entertaining the Changsha press, they declared that they were prepared to go on a collective hunger strike to petition. If they failed to achieve their goal, they would form a suicide squad of one hundred people to come to Hengyang to arrest the murderer by force. If such a situation were to develop, Hengyang would have another lively "fighting" performance.

Hengyang Has a Future

Despite how disorderly Hengyang appears now, Hengyang still has a future. Hengyang is the hometown of the great Confucian scholar Wang Chuanshan of the late Ming Dynasty. It is a land of propriety and righteousness, and education is still developed. Although there are questionable aspects to the local customs, there are still some simple and ancient traditions here. As long as it is properly guided, it will be better than large metropolitan cities. As for the prosperity of the Hengyang market, the prospects are even more unlimited. Hengyang has a geographical advantage, with a highway network extending in all directions, and the Guangdong-Hankou and Hunan-Guangxi railways, two major arteries in the southwest. The Xiangjiang and Ganhe rivers also converge here. Agricultural products from all over southern Hunan are gathered and distributed in the Hengyang market. Hengyang has sufficient conditions for prosperity. Since the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Factory has decided to locate its branch factory in Dongyangdu, Hengyang, the population of Dongyangdu has increased, and the Hunan-Guangxi Railway is being rebuilt and will be open to military traffic next month. The route from the city center to the station is no longer as deserted as it was a month ago. The citizens' vision of a prosperous New Hengyang is gradually turning from anticipation into reality. Some people compare Hengyang to the Chicago of the East in the future. This is not empty talk. It is indeed possible. Let's take a look in a few years!

The picture above shows the scenery of Wuyi Mountain, located on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. The main peak is in Chong'an County, northwestern Fujian. Legend has it that the immortal Wuyi lived here, hence the name. The mountain range spans over a hundred li, with thirty-six peaks and seventy-two rocks. The famous "Wuyi Tea" has a clear and fragrant taste, and is popular both at home and abroad. Because the mountain is densely populated with fir trees, it is also known as the Fir Ridge Range.

### Fuzhou "Flying Thief" - Numerous Cases Accumulated Over Three Years of Theft

(Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Fuzhou on the 22nd) Theft cases have been occurring frequently in Fuzhou City in recent months, but have not been solved. The former Municipal Operations Bureau received a tip that a habitual thief named Zhang Jinhuo, from Linsen County, was skilled at climbing walls and moving quickly like a swallow. He did not engage in honest work, but lived as a "gentleman on the roof," and was likely related to the various theft cases in Fuzhou City. After receiving the information, the police station also received intelligence that the thief would be committing a theft in Hongtang Township, Linsen County within a few days. The police station immediately dispatched several undercover detectives to lie in wait. The thief was indeed active in the township the day before yesterday and was captured by the detectives. Unexpectedly, the thief was physically strong and kicked one of the detectives, knocking him down. Fortunately, the other detectives stepped forward to surround him and capture him. They put him on a ferry to cross the Minjiang River at Hongshan Bridge. The thief jumped into the water again and fled. The detectives also jumped into the water to pursue him. After fighting in the water for half an hour, they finally recaptured him and took him to the bureau. According to his confession, he has committed countless thefts in the urban area of Fuzhou and various towns in Linsen County over the past three years. Most of the theft cases in Fuzhou City in recent months were all committed by him. The stolen goods will be recovered according to his confession in the next few days.

### Shenxi Shipping Joint Venture Salvages Sunken Ship in Huangdu

(Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 24th) The shipping of goods in the Shenxi area relies heavily on water transportation in addition to land transportation. However, a large Sichuan-style boat weighing over a hundred tons, loaded with white mud from Wuxi to Shanghai, accidentally hit a bridge pier while passing through the Huangdu Bridge on the evening of the 23rd and sank completely, blocking the bridge opening. As a result, no less than a thousand large and small ships traveling between Wuxi and Shanghai were blocked yesterday. The Shenxi Shipping Joint Venture urgently sent cadres to the scene (Huang) to cooperate with the relevant local authorities in the salvage work. It is estimated that it will take at least two or three days to salvage the sunken ship and clear the blockage.

### Food Control in Jinshan

The Jinshan County Government recently received a telegram from the provincial government stipulating that the following foods should be controlled: barley, soybeans, wheat, corn, sorghum, and millet.

The county government has forwarded the order for compliance. Also, it is reported that the collection of land tax in kind in the county has already begun. The standard collection rate for this year is one shi and two dou per yuan of tax, six dou for requisition, four dou and eight he for public grain, one dou and two he for accumulated grain (one-tenth of the tax in kind), and eight sheng for additional tax, totaling three shi and two dou (equivalent to 34 jin and 9 liang).

### Talking about "Strikes" from a Professor's Perspective

— Binbin

Recently, school "strikes" have almost become a "routine," a "daily occurrence." One wave subsides, and another rises. Before a few classes can be held, an entire semester is wasted. Some are in response to unfortunate events elsewhere (such as the suicide of a student surnamed Yu in Hangzhou), some are to resolve internal issues (such as the demands for "reinstatement" of two colleges in Beiping and Tangshan), some are for political reasons, and some are for international reasons. Those directly involved and the public opinion circles mostly focus on the relationship between students and the education authorities, or between young people and the government, while neglecting the perspective of the "professors." Therefore, Lao Bin will discuss it based on his personal experience.

Three parties agree and form the three elements of a school. The word "ke" (課, class) implies that schools are places for lecturing. Attending class, finishing class, lecturing, and studying are the closest activities between professors and students, and they are the basic conditions for every school to be a school. However, whenever "strikes" are mentioned, we only hear about the authorities being busy and the students being busy, while the professors are ambivalent and seem to be irrelevant. It was not until the spring and summer of this year when the student union and the professors of the Beiping Normal University and Beiyang Pingmin College had different opinions on the school's reorganization that the professors' meeting separately expressed their respective actions. The professors' meeting of Beiyang Pingmin College even proposed that all major school matters related to the overall situation should be decided by the agreement of three parties, namely: 1. the school's administrative authorities; 2. the professors' meeting; 3. the student union. The reason is that the three parties constitute the "three elements" of the school. Since the actions of the student union are not limited to "autonomy," the responsibilities of the professors' meeting should also not be limited to routine events such as curriculum and lectures. This is one point. Professors are hired to teaching positions, which is different from the purely administrative system of staff. They have their own positions with respect to the students and the authorities. This is the second point. In the past, professors did not have special organizations, but now that there is a "professors' meeting," it certainly has meaning, with the same concern for the overall situation as the student union.

The above is theoretically accurate and irrefutable. In fact, it is also indispensable. Please allow me to explain why:

This is a matter of fact, not law or theory. Normal classes, suspensions, and holidays are handled by the school's administrative department in accordance with the rules, and professors and students comply with them. Today's special suspensions (strikes) and classes (resumptions) are controlled by the student union. As long as they make a resolution, the classrooms will be empty, the school authorities cannot force it, and the professors have no classes to teach, so they have no choice but to strike. This is entirely a matter of fact.

"Strikes" have purposes, but the purposes of the student union and the professors' meeting may not be the same. If the student union believes that the purpose has been achieved and resolves to resume classes, then the authority of the professors' meeting has room to be expressed.

If students "strike" and there are professors but no students in the classroom, then the professors have no choice but to strike. This is understandable. If students "resume classes" but the professors "strike," leaving students but no professors in the classroom, then how can the students resume classes? This is not a hypothetical situation. In the past six months, this has already happened at a certain university in Beiping. When professors do not agree with the strike but have no choice but to strike, they say, "Okay, you decide on the strike, I decide on the resumption. We'll talk when you resolve to resume classes." This is what is meant by "any party has a way to block the road," and it is what is meant by "responding to fact with fact."

The above is factual and rational. The conclusion is that the "professors' meeting" should have the same expression on major school matters as the "student union." This is beneficial to the school's administrative authorities, and it is not without benefit to the student union. It has the effect of adjusting and controlling rampant strikes, and it has the wonderful effect of jointly cooperating and increasing teaching efficiency for legitimate and meaningful strikes.

### Putian to Go to Beijing Tomorrow, Invited by Great China University Today

Tea Party Reception Rescheduled

The Municipal Sports Association and the 99 Yishe Track and Field Team originally planned to host a tea party at the Kangle Restaurant on Nanjing West Road this afternoon to welcome the Putian Track and Field Visiting Team to Shanghai. However, the Putian team was invited by Great China University today to hold friendly matches with the school's basketball and volleyball teams, and Great China University will host a banquet in the evening. The team will take a train to Beijing tomorrow morning, so they will not have time to attend. The three groups of the Sports Association, 99, and Yishe issued a notice last night saying: The invitations have been temporarily cancelled, and a farewell party will be held at a later date after the visiting team returns to Shanghai from Beijing.

Enthusiastic Participation in Badminton League

Registration for the Second Badminton League has been extended to 5:00 PM on the 28th. Domestic teams that have participated include Yucai B Team and Xiaoguang Middle School. The Foreigners' Sports Federation will have two or three teams participating. Other teams such as the American Public School, the Western Overseas Youth Association, and other groups have a large number of teams. The A Team of China will be the strongest domestic team in the A Group this season. The champion of the B Group last season, Maicai, must be promoted to the A Group, but the list has not yet been submitted. St. John's University has a strong lineup and will also participate in the A Group. Therefore, this year's league will definitely be more lively than last year's. The league is divided into four types: men's B, mixed men and women, and women's group. The men's B group uses a single round-robin system, and the men's A group, women's group, and mixed men and women's group all use a double round-robin system. Each match consists of three doubles matches (must indicate which group of doubles). Each doubles match is played in three games, and the first to score fifteen points wins. (This league does not use the "wide release" tie-breaking score). Each team must have at least two groups participating in each match, otherwise it will be considered a forfeit. Each game won is worth one point, and the team with the most points is judged to win or lose. The team with the most points is the winner of the group's championship.

### Hong Kong Victory Shield Football Tournament: China United Wins First Battle Against Military United

China United's Forward Line is Sharp, Winning 3-2

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The Hong Kong Chinese Football Association is holding the Victory Shield to commemorate the victory of the Great War. It was decided that the Abandoned United and Military United will participate in the championship. The competition will be scored on a point system, with two points for each win. If a team wins one and draws one in two matches, they can retain the Victory Shield for one year. Taking advantage of the auspicious occasion of the British Princess's wedding (November 20), the first battle for the Victory Shield began. As a result, China United won at Causeway Bay, leading 3-1 in the first half. Military United scored one goal in the second half, losing by one goal.

Since the beginning of the season, foreign soldiers have never been able to stretch their arms due to the poor lineup. Military County has repeatedly deployed troops. They are always strong in defense and weak in attack. In addition, this year's Chinese team has a wealth of talent, so Military United's loss was expected.

In this battle, Military United got their starting forward, Ziviro, back, and the offensive was very sharp. The attack was more active than before, which is the best performance of the foreign hillbillies this year. The reason for the defeat is that although both sides have equal defensive strength, China United has a better forward line.

The goalkeepers on both sides performed well, so there were not many goals conceded. The order of goals: Military United's Ziviro first shot into the post and bounced in, 1-0. China United's Zhu Yongqiang scored two goals, and Guo Yingqi scored one goal. This is the record of the first half. In the second half, in the last minute, Military United's Kiaon took advantage of Yu Qien's fall to save the ball and shot again, ending the game 3-2. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

China United Team

Xie Jinhong (Oriental) Liu Songsheng (Kitchee) He Yingfen (Kitchee) Yu Qien (China) Kong Qingyu (China) Li Zhaorong (Kitchee) Zhu Yongqiang (Oriental)

Hou Rongsheng (Kitchee) Wen Zhi (Bus) (Oriental

Military United Team

Sutter (Air Force) Garrick (Artillery) Yuch (Navy) Garrasji (Artillery) Barna (Devon) Kiaon (Yanbing) Ziviro (Air Force) Jennas (Devon)

Boyas (Baff) Sabat (Artillery) Westy (Baff)

### Purchasing Imported Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange: Details of the Review are Being Negotiated; "Simplicity" and "Speed" are the Principles for Purchasing Procedures

(Our Report) After the establishment of the Review Committee for Handling Imported Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange by the China Trust Bureau, it was decided to handle imported goods with self-provided foreign exchange without permits prudently according to the two major principles of speed and simplicity. It is reported that the relevant associations such as import and export merchants in this city will, within one week, classify and evaluate the goods arriving at the port as soon as possible and submit detailed lists to the subcommittee of the Review Committee to provide opinions. After the subcommittee reviews them, if there are no problems, it can draft detailed review rules and submit them to the Review Committee's regular meeting for approval and implementation. If the procedures are handled smoothly, the detailed review rules can be reviewed and implemented within three weeks. After a meeting of sixteen units of import and export merchants and other associations in this city some days ago, representatives were appointed yesterday to report to the relevant authorities of the Import and Export Management Committee. Agreement has been reached on the following points: 1. The original regulations stipulated that imported goods with self-provided foreign exchange without permits that are not willing to apply for purchase should be re-exported within 60 days after the "Measures for Handling Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange" are announced. It is now changed to re-exporting within 60 days after the detailed review rules for goods with self-provided foreign exchange are announced. 2. Goods that have been registered for re-export after the promulgation of the handling measures can also be flexibly handled if they wish to cancel the registration for re-export. 3. If the cargo owner is a wholesaler and needs to re-wholesale to retail customers or small wholesalers in other places, and cannot provide the documents of direct users one by one, it is permissible for the local chamber of commerce or relevant trade association to provide the documents, and after verification, it will also be approved for priority purchase. The Import and Export Management Committee has also agreed to consider this.

Chinese Stocks See New Highs, Sudden Rebound Before Closing

Chinese stocks fluctuated greatly yesterday. Although the margin issue held the power of life and death, the stimulus of financial commodities arose again. After being weak, they became popular. Zhongtu Yongsha set new highs of 429 yuan and 432 yuan midway, but weakened before closing.

At the opening in the morning, due to reports that there was no sign of reducing the margin, Yongsha opened low to 402 yuan, and then fell to low prices of 394 yuan and 397 yuan. Exchange rates hung high, and buyers were eager, pushing the price up to an immediate delivery price of 423 yuan and a deferred delivery price of 424 yuan. Therefore, those who closed out at high prices and those who maintained at low prices struggled with each other. The off-market interest rate opened high to 22.5 cents and 2.7 cents, and the money market tightened, repeatedly retreating to within 410 yuan. The closing price at noon was 416 yuan and 420 yuan.

In the afternoon, off-market financial commodities became popular again. Therefore, although the evening news reported that the Executive Yuan did not discuss the margin issue, the market still opened at high prices. The immediate delivery price was 429 yuan, and the deferred delivery price was 432 yuan. After entering the market, the exchange situation of the National Bank was unstable. Major shareholders bought and sold, and the market price fluctuated, hovering between 422 yuan and 430 yuan. Many small shareholders were panicked, and there were news of cargo payments. A rebound suddenly occurred before closing, falling to a low price of 405 yuan. Nos. 202 and 186 maintained, and the closing price was 406 yuan and 408 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning closing price of immediate delivery shares, Mei Ya, Xinguang, and Jingfu each fell by half a cent, while Qinxing, Zhabei, Tongyi, Huameng, Yonggong, and Shangping, China Textiles, Datong, and National Goods rose slightly, Xin Ya rose by half a cent, and the rest fell slightly. Among the deferred delivery shares, Mei Ya, Xinguang, and Jingfu fell by half a cent, and the rest fell slightly. Off-market old shares, bank shares, and cultural shares were still stable, and the rest were flat.

### Xu Baiyuan Flies to Hong Kong and Transfers to Guangzhou to Inspect Financial Affairs in South China

Xu Baituan, Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Four Allied Banks, in order to inspect the financial situation in South China and attend the economic construction conference convened by the Xingyuan, took a Civil Aviation flight to Hong Kong and transferred to Guangzhou on the morning of the 25th, accompanied by Mr. Zhu Shengquan, a commissioner of the Four Allied Banks, and his entourage. Since Song Ziwen took charge of Guangdong, he has seen that the financial resources in Guangdong and Guangxi are extremely abundant, but due to the situation, they have not been properly utilized, and the industry has declined instead, and foreign goods have flooded in. In order to cooperate with the national policy and develop the economy of South China, a specific construction plan is being prepared, and the construction of the Huangpu Port is one part of the plan. The implementation of this plan depends on the cooperation of finance. Therefore, the Executive Yuan designated Mr. Xu to go to Guangzhou. Before his departure, Mr. Xu told reporters: This trip may take a week. How to coordinate the financial aspects with the economic construction of South China in the future will depend on contact with all parties and research of relevant information before a specific plan can be determined based on the facts.

### Economic Authorities Announce Measures to Prevent Coal Hoarding; Factories are Limited to Two Months' Worth of Coal

The economic authorities of this city, in view of the fact that the cold winter has arrived and coal is very important, and due to the hoarding and manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the market price has fluctuated greatly. Now, in order to prevent the hoarding and manipulation of coal in Shanghai and affect people's lives, a measure has been formulated and announced for implementation. All coal storage in this city, including bituminous coal, anthracite coal, and coke, shall be handled in accordance with the measures for cracking down on hoarding of daily necessities in extraordinary times, and shall also be handled in accordance with these measures. The amount of coal stored by factories is limited to two months' consumption. The amount of coal stored by coal merchants is limited to one month's business volume. However, those who purchase in large quantities from non-controlled mining areas may report to the Fuel Management Committee for approval to increase the amount of storage. The amount of coal stored in coal yards is limited to one month for depositors. If the time limit is exceeded and the excess amount is more than 100 tons, approval must be obtained. Except for coal merchants, coal yards, and those who really need coal, no one shall store coal. If anyone violates these measures and stores coal, or stores more than the limited amount, or fails to clear it out, the Fuel Committee will purchase it at the allocated price. For all coal purchased for violating these measures, 30% of the purchase price shall be deducted and used as a bonus for the investigators. If it is discovered due to a secret report, the bonus shall be divided equally between the secret informant and the handling personnel. These measures have been approved by the Shanghai Economic Inspection Committee and will be implemented from today. They will also be reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for filing by the Fuel Management Committee.

### Spirited Sentiment and Strong Buying Interest: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Rise in Unison; 20-count Coarse Yarn Jumps 2,800,000 Yuan

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions saw strong interest from Tianjin merchants due to favorable reports from Tianjin. Merchants from Guangdong and Wuhan followed suit, further fueled by rising cloth prices. Market sentiment was high, and industry players were eager to buy. Sellers seized the opportunity to raise prices, leading to a surge in the market. In particular, 20-count "Celestial Maiden Brand" yarn was highly sought after by merchants, with its price jumping 2,800,000 yuan from the previous day to 32,500,000 yuan. 42-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn reached a high of 48,500,000 yuan, a rise of 2,500,000 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also continued to rise by 1,200,000 to 2,000,000 yuan.

The cotton cloth market opened this morning with tight credit and the impending sale of Peng Textile products, resulting in ample high-grade cloth on the market. Overnight gains were quickly relinquished, and prices initially declined. However, in the afternoon, merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, and news of a rising US dollar exchange rate and soaring cotton yarn prices boosted market sentiment. Asking prices rose again. By the end of the day, 12-pound "Dragon Head" and other fine cloths rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Biji (coarse cotton cloth) and Shanggong (tribute cloth) were in high demand, rebounding by 20,000 to 40,000 yuan. Other cloths also showed firm footing.

Peng Textile Cloth Sales

[Our Report] The China Peng Textile Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 16,600 bolts, equivalent to 18,820 single bolts, and 550 bedsheets. A total of 330 purchase orders were received, including 26 from manufacturers, purchasing 2,820 bolts, equivalent to 5,040 single bolts. 304 orders came from cloth merchants, purchasing 13,780 bolts, and 550 bedsheets.

Spot Cotton Becomes Popular

Yesterday's spot cotton market saw a relatively stable opening with strong supply and demand. In the afternoon, as cotton yarn prices surged, spinning mills increased their buying interest, and industry players rushed to replenish their stocks. The market turned firm, with asking prices rising by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan. Overall trading was active, with 1,800 bales changing hands. Prices for delivery to factories opened with Ling Shi at 5,250,000 to 5,456,000 yuan, De Zi cotton at 5,620,000 yuan, Shashi cotton at 5,373,000 yuan, 1/16 Midland cotton at 6,283,000 yuan, and Sanyu Town cotton at 4,877,000 yuan, with 1,100 bales traded. Warehouse delivery prices opened with Shi at 5,200,000 to 5,330,000 yuan, Shashi cotton at 5,290,000 yuan, Huoji cotton at 3,470,000 yuan, Han Fine cotton at 4,920,000 to 5,084,000 yuan, and Pengjia Slope cotton at 5,208,000 yuan, with 700 bales traded.

### Rayon First Firm, Then Weak; Mill-Made Silk Goods Continue to Hold Firm

The rayon market once soared in the afternoon yesterday but eventually declined, closing 3,000,000 yuan higher than the previous day. 120-count Asahi brand 1A bright rayon opened with bids at 2,000,000 yuan in the morning, rising to 4,000,000 yuan by noon. It reached a high of 8,000,000 yuan in the afternoon, but due to tightening credit, market sentiment weakened, and it finally fell to a selling price of 5,000,000 yuan. 4A Toyo was around 980,000 yuan.

Mill Silk

The market rose in the early session and continued to hold firm in the later session. Final asking prices for all grades were 40,000 to 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The morning transaction price for high-grade lots was 80,000,000 to 80,050,000 yuan, with afternoon transactions ranging from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 yuan. This was due to depleted stocks and the fact that many Wuxi silk mills were suspending operations due to a lack of raw materials, which greatly boosted market confidence.

Silk Goods

Yesterday's market for silk quilt covers and "Dazhan" (big battle) and "Biqiang" (strong pen) goods opened around 9,200,000 yuan, briefly falling below 9,000,000 yuan. However, as various parties took advantage of the low prices to buy, the market rebounded to 9,500,000 yuan, similar to the closing price of the previous afternoon. In the afternoon, rising raw material prices further boosted market sentiment, and the market eventually reached a new high of 30,080,000 yuan. However, other goods saw limited actual demand, and although they rose in unison due to cost factors, the gains were relatively moderate.

### Textile Adjustment Committee Orders Relevant Institutions to Prepare for Implementation of Joint Cotton Yarn Distribution

The following merchants and amounts, having completed guarantees from designated banks, have been fully approved: For importers of gold thread, fourteen companies including Kunhe Huahang, Chifeng Huahang, Huitai Import and Export, Zhongfei Import and Export, Jianye Xingji Huahang, Yingmeng Huahang, Wanxiang Trading Company, Yichang Huahang, Ruihe Hang, Guo Xianji Trading Company, Fulong Huahang, Wanchun Import and Export, Dongchun Hang, and Hua Fu Trading Company have been approved to import 38,500 kilograms of gold thread, requiring a total of US$166,025 in foreign exchange. For importers of ramie, thirteen companies including Zhongfei Import and Export, Yu Ji Huahang, Zhanfeng Huahang, Jianye Yu Ji Huahang, Yingfeng Yehang, Kunhe Huahang, Wanxiang Trading Company, Maoli Huahang, Fulong Huahang, Wanchun Import and Export, Dongchun Hang, Ruihe Hang, and Huizhai Import and Export have been approved to import 845 bales of Soviet ramie, requiring a total of US$63,481 in foreign exchange. For importers of thorn-woven ramie cloth, only Housheng Company has been approved to import 10,021.50 chi, requiring a total of £3,392, 7 shillings, and 2 pence in foreign exchange.

Foreign Exchange Earned from Exports to Be Sold to Designated Banks

[Our Report] In order to promote exports and earn foreign exchange, the Export Promotion Department of the Export and Import Control Commission previously approved a special project to pilot the import of raw materials for straw hats and embroidery. It was stipulated that exporters applying to import these raw materials must have their designated banks guarantee that all imported raw materials must be used to produce finished products for export. Based on current domestic and international market prices of raw materials and finished products, the foreign exchange earned from the export of finished products is estimated to be greater than five times the foreign exchange required for the import of raw materials. According to current regulations, the foreign exchange earned from the sale of finished products must be sold to designated banks. Reports that manufacturers applying to import raw materials are required to have banks guarantee that four-fifths of the foreign exchange earned from the finished products made from these raw materials will be settled with national banks are inaccurate.

### Taiwan Aluminum Plant to Commence Operations Next Month

The annual import quota for aluminum ingots is set at 5,000 tons. The current selling price is approximately US$350 per ton, requiring a total of US$1.75 million in foreign exchange. The Taiwan Aluminum Plant under the Resources Commission will commence operations in mid-December. Aluminum ore, the raw material for aluminum ingots, will be purchased from Southeast Asia. The plant estimates that it will need US$390,000 in foreign exchange to purchase the aluminum ore required to manufacture 5,000 tons of aluminum, which would save over a million US dollars in foreign exchange.

### Declining Supply of Pig Lead; Tin Foil Industry Petitions for Allocation

Since the tin foil industry in this city resumed operations in May of this year, the composition and quality of finished products have been continuously improved, making them comparable to imported products. However, among the various main raw materials for tin foil, the most severe shortage is pig lead. The supply of foreign lead produced in Canada and Mexico, as well as domestic lead from provinces such as North China and Yunnan, is decreasing, and black market prices are soaring. Compared to January of this year, prices have increased more than sixfold, compared to April they have increased fourfold, and compared to August they have increased two and a half times. Moreover, domestic transportation is not yet smooth, and the quantity of domestic lead transported from areas such as North Hebei and South Sichuan is gradually decreasing. The future supply of pig lead is a major concern. Therefore, the industry has petitioned the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office for a monthly allocation of pig lead raw materials required for the monthly production of 20,000 "jiao" of tin foil.

### Large Sums of Yarn and Sugar Settled; National Banks Injected Substantial Amounts

[Our Report] Yesterday, credit tightened in the city as national banks settled large sums for cotton yarn and sugar, injecting a total of 74.4 billion yuan. The shadow interest rate rose to 21%, and the interbank lending rate for Chinese shares ranged from 22.5% to 27%. National banks injected 24.3 billion yuan, the Great Exchange injected 6.2 billion yuan, foreign merchants injected 35.4 billion yuan, the Small Exchange took out 116 billion yuan, the Bank of China injected 92.7 billion yuan, the Agricultural Bank took out 19.7 billion yuan, and other banks' inflows and outflows were insignificant.

### Ministry of Finance Investigates Reasons for Returned Checks

Most Due to Insufficient Funds

In order to investigate the reasons for returned checks, the Ministry of Finance dispatched personnel on the 24th to conduct spot checks on five banks and firms with relatively good credit. The investigation revealed that the main reason for returned checks was insufficient funds. The Ministry of Finance is now paying attention to this issue and is drafting measures to deal with returned checks due to insufficient funds, vowing to impose strict sanctions.

According to information from the Audit Department of the National Bank, the Ministry of Finance has revised the measures regarding the inability to use checks on the same day and will implement them immediately upon receiving the order.

Commercial Briefs

The Central Bank's Loan Committee held its 33rd routine meeting yesterday, discussing industrial loan applications. As a result, 31 applications were approved, totaling 76.2 billion yuan.

In order to increase efficiency, the Central Bank is actively simplifying administrative procedures. It is using telephone calls instead of written documents and striving to avoid complex details in general document processing.

The continued export of frozen eggs to the UK has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the China Trust Bureau is handling the purchase. The first batch of 200 tons and the second batch of 100 tons have been purchased.

Spring and Autumn

### This Year's Hit Playwright on Broadway: Anderson

— United States Information Service

In mid-July of this year, Hollywood began filming the screenplay for "Joan of Lorraine." At the same time, another play by Maxwell Anderson will be staged on Broadway, potentially setting a record for audiences appreciating his work. Anderson's play, written for characters with historical interest and poetic sentiment, is the most significant theatrical achievement of the 1946-47 New York theatrical season. This is not only because Ingrid Bergman portrays the character of Joan of Arc with brilliance, but also because the play itself provides Anderson with a tool to raise questions that many have felt for years: What can a person believe in?

Anderson's answer is a belief in personal conscience, which opposes the blind worship of power prevalent in the 20th century.

"Joan of Lorraine" proves that theater does not necessarily have to be entertainment or amusement; it can also be used to explore philosophical and religious issues, while still being successful. Anderson argues that all of his plays should be examples of his idea of how the stage should be used. If he has something to say, a question to raise, then the play should be his tool for expressing it.

Anderson was born on December 15, 1888, in Atlantic City, Pennsylvania. In his early years, his family moved repeatedly, from Pennsylvania to Ohio and Iowa in the west, and finally settled in North Dakota, where he studied locally.

He rejected his father's suggestion that he dedicate himself to the ministry. He loved writing from an early age. While studying at the University of North Dakota, he worked as a gatekeeper and attendant at a newspaper office in Grand Forks to support himself. In 1911, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree and then took on a teaching position. He spoke frankly, and when he discussed pacifism with his students, he immediately had arguments with them, because at that time, the issue was not yet popular.

After leaving North Dakota, Anderson went to the West and became a lecturer at Stanford University, where he taught English and pursued advanced studies as a research student. He obtained a doctorate from Stanford University in 1914 and took over as a professor at Whittier College in Southern California.

His outspokenness again led to disagreements with his superiors, so he returned to North Dakota to work in journalism, briefly serving as the editor of the Grand Forks "Herald." Soon after, he went west to San Francisco to work as a columnist for the "Chronicle." However, his frank remarks again caused trouble, and he was finally advised to find another job. For the next six years, he worked in New York, first at the New Republic, then at the New York Globe and Commercial Advertiser and the New York World.

In May 1923, after seeing "Six Characters in Search of an Author," he became a playwright himself. He wrote the play "White Desert." The play was highly praised by critics, but it was not considered a success by the general public.

Later, Anderson met Laurence Stallings and co-wrote one of his more successful plays, "What Price Glory," which premiered in New York on September 3, 1924. He then wrote several plays, but none were very successful until his play "Saturday's Children" premiered in New York in January 1927, receiving great acclaim.

The following years were a prolific period for Anderson, with famous works such as "Both Your Houses" and "High Tor."

As the crisis of war became increasingly serious, Anderson tried to write his ideas against the fascist way of life into plays. He wrote "Key Largo" based on the story of an American youth who joined the Spanish Republican Army, and then "Candle in the Wind" based on the Nazi regime in occupied France, neither of which was a great success. It was not until 1942 that he wrote a masterpiece, which was the first good American play about the US military during wartime. The play was titled "The Eve of St. Mark," and the story was quite simple, about a rural boy who enlisted in the army, with a line saying, "In order to make this a place for free men, we must be the first to fight, the first to sacrifice." Recently, the play "Joan of Lorraine" has made him a leading playwright once again.

### Eyesore

— Kai Gong

"Yishan Miscellany" is not included in the New Tang paintings. Chen Zhensun of the Song dynasty said in "Annotations on the Book Records of Zhi Zhai" that it was written by Li Yishan Shangyin. Among them, there is a section called "Eyesore," which says: "Shouting commands under pine trees, shedding tears while looking at flowers, laying mats on moss, cutting down supporting willows, drying trousers under flowers, carrying heavy loads while enjoying spring, tying horses to stone bamboos, holding torches under the moon, a general walking on foot, building houses against mountains, referring to vegetables in orchards, raising chickens and ducks under flower trellises." Lu Xun said, "Although they are all common sayings and vulgar matters, they deeply penetrate the hidden aspects of worldly affairs."

### Feeling Inspired by Visiting the Chrysanthemums at Fuxing Park Again

— Jin Gong

Part One

Visiting chrysanthemums on Fuxing Road, leisurely entering this garden, the yellow flowers competing in brilliance, one no longer hears the cries of monkeys (the monkeys in the zoo have long disappeared). The five colors are allowed to compete, a sound seems to want to speak; the old man frequently drags his cane, daring to take a leisurely pace without fear of trouble.

Part Two

The sound surrounds the edge, people travel through the midst in a continuous stream; although the many flowers are viewed, only a few children are seen; after looking back, they are suddenly in front, walking west and turning east again; I know it is not a feast for the eyes, but I still shout endless joy.

Part Three

It is said that in the secluded clusters, new red and yellow embellishments are seen; people come to evaluate the faces of the chrysanthemums, the chrysanthemums laugh at the people looking at the flowers; Tao Yuanming has a noble integrity, fearing to bend his waist equal to his height; walking together, I carry my clever palm (the name of my young daughter), children are naturally innocent.

### Starting with Water Margin – Discussing the Evolution of Literature

— Yu Ying

The predecessor of Water Margin was "Events of the Xuanhe Era" and similar vernacular tales. The author was not just one or two people, and the stories of the 108 heroes also seemed to have various versions with no definitive lineage. Due to centuries of evolution, it became "Water Margin." It is similar to Homer's epics, where the sources of the characters and stories are all found in folk tales. After being transmitted and written by the masses, the characters and stories will inevitably be added to or deleted, but the more additions and deletions, the more brilliant they become. Gorky said in "The Diminution of Personality":

"Othello, Hamlet... all these archetypes were created before Shakespeare. The Spanish people sang 'Life is a Dream' before Calderón wrote it, and the Moors were before the Spanish. The knight of virtue was mocked in folk tales before Cervantes' 'Don Quixote.' And with the same sarcasm, the same poignancy; Milton and Dryden, Mickiewicz, Goethe, and Schiller, when they received inspiration from the unfathomable source of folk poetry, when they gained the wisdom of collective creation, they soared to the highest realm."

No typical image can be shaped out of thin air by one or two poets. Ah Q lives in Weizhuang and also lives in the hearts of the Chinese masses. The heroes, thugs, officials, and rascals in "Water Margin" were also vivid before the eyes of the common people, engraved and depicted by the nameless writers and singers of that time, becoming more and more archetypal and prominent through evolution. This is why the "powerful source" gave birth to this group of archetypal characters, which is what Gorky said: gaining the wisdom of collective creation. The writing skills of the author of "Water Margin," the author of "Don Quixote," and the author of "Othello" also soared to the "highest realm."

"The end in itself" is the slogan of art-for-art's-sake advocates. What is the purpose of literature? Everyone has already said it during the "rectification of names." Positively, it is to make human life better; negatively, it can target destroyers and attack those who hinder the normal development of social life. Literature is one of the branches of art, and the effect of art is to help create new human beings and help overcome what binds the growth of new human beings. I think the most important mission of writers is to expand life experiences, search for folk tales and legends, and promote and evolve them - this is extremely necessary.

The objects depicted by literature often undergo a qualitative change due to social changes. The objects of temple literature are the trivial matters of emperors, and the objects of academic literature are the abstruse discussions of one or two ancient philosophers. From ancient times to the present, the evolution to the current focus on the lives of people as the object of literary description has indeed gone through many twists and turns. Even with the same character, the peasants in the hands of poets in the old era were slaves of nature, and the archetype was mostly a wretched, troubled, and battered character. Today, the peasants under the pen of poets have already taken on a different appearance.

As for past literature, whether classical, romantic, or naturalist, the road was always trod out by our ancestors, and in fact, the steps were indeed from scattered and slow to strong and striving. New themes are increasingly being discovered in human life, and new writers also have newer writing skills and life experiences. They come from the people, and they are also familiar with the people, so they are more likely to accept the literary themes of the people. Lafargue thought that making the old themes deteriorate was the victory of realism, and once said: "The amazement at the people, the intoxication with the power and talent of the people, has replaced the previous obedience to nature and passive expectations, which mostly expressed a lack of confidence in humanity and a pessimistic attitude towards social progress."

These are all extremely objective statements. We can understand that in the hands of the Ming people, the ending of Water Margin was "pacifying the four bandits," and the heroes were transformed into bureaucrats; once in the hands of hack writers, the ending became what was recorded in "Crushing the Bandits," and the heroes were all killed. —The themes and techniques, consciousness and content of literature all evolve with the evolution of the times.

Rural Chapter

### Faintly

— Lu Ting

More than ten years ago, the roadside pavilion at the foot of the small mountain was complete and intact: a small pavilion with a relatively high earthen wall facing west at the pavilion entrance. In summer, weary travelers would sit on the stone benches along the earthen wall to rest, the setting sun would not shine on their bodies; the wind, however, could gently brush over them. In winter, sitting in the pavilion, an old woman would bake sweet potatoes to satisfy the hunger of passersby, and the bonfire would also warm the hearts of every traveler.

Today, with years of continuous disasters and endless man-made calamities, not only has the screen wall of the roadside pavilion long collapsed, but every corner of the pavilion also leaks. In summer, there is wild grass and stagnant water inside... In winter, a houseful of cold wind blows through... Apart from a wild bird "cawing" and startlingly flying out from inside, travelers no longer stop there to rest...

Ah, the roadside pavilion has lost its coolness and warmth, so it becomes lonely in the desolate land.

### Idle Waterwheel

— Poem by Chen Chi, Woodcut by Bai Shao

The waterwheel is idle,

Dozing off.

The fields, like stiff corpses,

Are wretched beyond words.

The thatch on the roof is disheveled,

Whipped by the irrational wild wind.

The village sobs silently...

The kind waterwheel,

For years, laboring without reward,

Trembling,

Carefully holding the river water.

(Farmers see it as sweet as nectar...

One scoop,

One scoop.

Not even enough time to see the faces clearly,

Just hurriedly

Passing it on to the fields.

The waterwheel

Never complains of its bitter fate.

To quench the thirst of others,

The waterwheel doesn't mind hard work...

The waterwheel, today,

Our friend who has shared our hardships for so many years,

Is bored with idleness.

Since the third watch of the night when officials arrest people,

It has been for a long, long time,

Having lost the treading of its relative-like toes.

The waterwheel's lips

Are parched and dry,

Like a wet nurse who has no milk

Watching the child who needs milk.

The waterwheel is so sad,

It can't even cry out a tear.

The waterwheel

Is painfully silent.

Who has taken away

Its hoarse melody?

The waterwheel, like the village,

Is having a very long dream...

In these years of war and chaos,

One can't afford to walk with lanterns,

One can't rely on the old days.

And our farmers,

With a bundle and umbrella on their shoulders,

Go to the city to seek refuge with distant relatives.

Heaven and earth wear a mourning face.

The village whispers endless desolation.

The waterwheel, like an abandoned orphan,

Under the eaves of the thatched house,

Guards the suffering of the countryside...

Shanghai's Major Factories and Stores Celebrate the 75th Anniversary of Shen Bao with a Joint Grand Giveaway – 24

Chairman Chiang

Everyone must have a strong physique. Prevention is the fundamental plan.

Jin Baoshan

As society evolves, there are more opportunities for human health to be robbed. In fact, most diseases can be prevented. Modern medicine's most important aspect is preventive medicine, with the goal of enabling all of us to enjoy the richest life and achieve true health.

Li Tingan

Seeking medical treatment when one is already sick is a last resort. The pain of medicine and surgery, as well as the loss of time and money, are secondary to the fact that disease is always our danger and threat. It is better to prepare for rain than to dig a well when thirsty!

Liu Ruiheng

"Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals must advance toward a public health system, so that everyone can enjoy medical care. This must be promoted." Considering the current society, simply popularizing health checkups can lead to early treatment, avoiding economic and health bankruptcy. This is an urgent task.

Ding Huikang

Speaking at the National Shanghai Medical College, he said: "The day when health checkups and disease insurance are popularized in our country will be the starting point for the success of the new medicine, and also the turning point for national health and revival." Eradicating the shame of being the "sick man of Asia" and clearing potential disease sources is all in this one effort. Early detection can shorten the treatment time from three to five years to only five or six months. How much time and money would it take to treat a severe patient? Therefore, the benefits of health checkups are immeasurable.

Hu Dingan

The short lifespan and high disease rate of the Chinese people, as well as the alarming infant mortality rate, make raising health standards an urgent requirement of the times. I hope the press will help promote the "important significance of health," and that the people will also fight for their health rights.

Jin Zhenyu

Strive for stability from the family to society to the nation. Economy first, health first.

### The Door to Health

Wilkie

The author of "One World" says: "Health is more important than everything."

Shen Bao

Editorial on the Development of the 26th Anti-Tuberculosis Movement: "The Hongqiao Sanatorium and the Health Bureau, with the assistance of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, are conducting X-ray tuberculosis screenings. Through scientific identification, diseases are prevented before they occur, and the effectiveness of treatment is increased. Tuberculosis infection is more dangerous for young people. Everyone knows to cherish their lives. Based on concrete evidence, we can promote public awareness of prevention and ensure public safety."

Mayor Wu

Modern education prioritizes health. Check physical condition and correct shortcomings.

Zhang Wei

Speaking at the press reception: "Regarding the health of employees, in order to ensure the health of reporters, health checkups must be conducted once a year to detect any diseases." This is the only way to guarantee health.

Wu Shaoqing

In countries with developed health education, everyone has a health checkup once a year. In China, this is not yet common, so diseases cannot be detected in their latent stages. If all hidden minor illnesses are identified,

Wang Xiaolai

American public health is improving, and general health is improving. I gained eight pounds in thirty-six days in America.

Shui Xiangyun

Improving the health of workers is an important condition for revitalizing industry.

Gu Qianlin

Emergency loans for illness to help the poor are a good and kind idea, deeply admirable. However, the prevalence of chronic diseases in society and their tragic consequences are a hundred times greater than acute diseases. Spending a small amount of money to achieve a supreme effect is to implement timely health checkups. Then any deadly diseases can be eliminated early.

### The Art of Healthy Longevity—Why Should We Die in Vain?

— Written by Laverin Lader of the United States

We should always check the cars we use to prevent damage. But why do we only pay attention to our own bodies after we are sick, and only then seek medical help? Isn't it too late!

A certain gentleman never got sick and usually exercised. However, he suddenly fainted in the office and passed away a week later, at the young age of less than fifty. Such a death is truly not worth it! All chronic diseases grow slowly and insidiously, and patients are often unaware. However, according to medical statistics, if physical examinations are performed every year, early detection and timely treatment can prevent death. The vast majority of deaths are unnecessary sacrifices. We may think that we are very healthy, walking briskly, and have no signs of illness. However, most deadly diseases do not give any warning beforehand. By the time they are discovered, it is too late! Dr. John of the Life Extension Research Institute reported that among a thousand businessmen who thought they were healthy and were buying cars or real estate, only one hundred and fourteen were truly healthy. Sixteen of them had diseases that were already quite serious. Because most people do not pay attention to real deadly diseases, they unknowingly kill many people without realizing it.

For the sake of our health and to avoid unnecessary deaths, why not have a physical examination once a year? There is no loss in time or energy, and the benefits are endless. The value of examination lies in preventing disease and detecting latent conditions. Many deadly diseases are easily cured if detected early. There are many examples. The cost of examination is also not high. Why not spend a small amount of money to gain health and longevity? In this era of scientific prosperity, it would be unjust to die in vain!

According to medical statistics, countless patients die each year from cancer or tuberculosis. If they could only remember one thing early on, they would surely be able to live several more years. What is this thing? It is neither a miraculously effective new drug nor a mysterious medical technique, but merely an annual physical examination.

### When to Conduct Examinations

— Qin Tingyu

All formal physicians should instruct patients to undergo health checkups to thoroughly understand the cause of their illness and shorten the treatment time.

Before seeking medical treatment, all patients should first go to various hospitals or pathological testing laboratories to obtain a detailed report and present it to the physician. This will ensure accurate medication and double the effectiveness, leading to early recovery and stable production.

Before marriage, a health checkup should be conducted to ensure that both parties understand their health status. This is not only of great importance for eugenics in the second generation but also directly avoids various tragic consequences in the future. This step should not be neglected.

Anyone who suffers from a persistent cough or cold, weight loss, or general fatigue without knowing the cause, or who has hemoptysis, or after an acute infectious disease, should undergo a full body examination to prevent the latency of the disease.

Healthy people should undergo a full body examination every year. People in large cities are easily infected with diseases. The onset of disease is often not noticed, especially by young people. Like water mines in the sea, they must be cleaned frequently. Once they explode, it is too late to regret.

According to Dr. Ding Huikang's view, anyone suffering from a chronic disease that does not improve after three weeks should immediately undergo a full body health examination to avoid delaying their own condition and losing the golden opportunity for treatment. This is the turning point for turning weakness into strength. Therefore, doctors should provide proper guidance, and patients must thoroughly understand that one point of prevention is better than ten points of treatment. As the saying goes, it is better to prepare for rain than to dig a well when thirsty. "The body is the summation of personal capital." Safeguarding health and developing a career are of paramount importance.

### 30% of American Youths Fail Military Enlistment

In 1945, President Truman proposed the Economic Bill of Rights to Congress. These rights should be vested in every American citizen: the right to receive appropriate medical care and enjoy health, and the right to be fully protected from disease. On April 1, 1945, approximately five million registrants between the ages of eighteen and thirty-seven were given physical examinations, and approximately 30% were deemed unfit for military service. The youths who were rejected for enlistment were not unable to work, but their diseases and defects could hinder or reduce work efficiency or shorten their lifespan. Therefore, methods should be sought to prevent and treat the diseases or defects of every young person as early as possible. Although modern medicine is rapidly developing and science is advancing rapidly, countless people still die each year from preventable diseases, which is more than the casualties in the entire war. We must firmly recognize that the health of the people is a national undertaking, and that how to prevent the spread of diseases and how to promote the physical health of the people are the only ways to achieve the same victory through the recognition and acquisition of such possibilities.

### Legislative Member Wu Wentian Suddenly Suffers Stroke and Dies

(Shen Bao News) Legislative Member Wu Wentian had just returned to Suzhou from Shanghai on the 10th and went to rest at the Industry Bank. During dinner, he was still chatting with friends. However, after dinner, he suddenly suffered a stroke and became unconscious. He was treated by a doctor, but there was no hope of recovery. He passed away at 11:30, at the young age of only forty-four.

Since Mr. Wu devoted himself to the central government, if he had undergone a health checkup and taken early precautions, he would not have suddenly met this misfortune.

### Popularizing Health Checkups for the Service of Readers

"Being without illness is a blessing in life; only when sick do we know health is a fairy." However, how can we ensure the health of the public? There is only one way: to popularize health checkups. The examinations at our hospital ensure that the public obtains an accurate and detailed report in the shortest possible time, not only understanding their individual health status but also eliminating the danger of latent diseases and obtaining the opportunity for early treatment, thereby ushering society into a healthy domain. In terms of fees, those who hold the examination certificate of this newspaper will only be charged 300,000 yuan, which is only one-tenth of the pre-war fee of 50 yuan. Our hospital aims to serve society, promote prevention, eradicate infection, and gather the rewards of science to seek happiness for the public. We sincerely hope that all parties will assist in completing this mission. (Checkups are available every day in the morning and afternoon, and regular checkups are available on Sunday mornings.)

### City Council Suggests National Assembly Guarantee People's Health

City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Ji sent a telegram to the Nanjing National Assembly, suggesting that people's health be guaranteed. The general idea is that the strength or weakness of the people's bodies is related to the rise and fall of the nation. In the past century, domestic strife and foreign aggression have prevented politics from getting on track, and the national physique has become increasingly frail, and morale has declined. It is extremely shameful to be called the "sick man of Asia"! The people's lack of attention to hygiene has a profound impact on the survival of the nation. The crux of the problem is that the people are complacent and self-destructive. The state should urgently formulate a comprehensive and concrete policy, and guarantee that the people can enjoy all kinds of measures derived from science. This would be a model for modern democratic countries to seek welfare for the people. It is specifically recommended that the National Assembly add a clause in the constitution to guarantee the people's health, so as to strengthen the nation.

The strength or weakness of the people's bodies is related to the rise and fall of the nation.

Promoting hygiene and physical fitness depends on advocacy.

### Premarital Health Checkups—The Health Bureau is Thinking of the Next Generation of Young Citizens...

Regarding the issue of required physical examinations before marriage, Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei said that this measure is absolutely necessary. Zhang said: "In order to simplify procedures and facilitate citizens' checkups, we do not intend to designate hospitals. Any doctor registered and qualified by the Health Bureau can handle the matter and issue a certificate. This examination does not mean that marriage will be prohibited if the results are not satisfactory. If there are shortcomings, they can of course be corrected. Otherwise, the harm will be passed on to later generations. This is extremely important to the country and the nation! In short, this matter is worth promoting. To strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the race. A marriage physical examination is a prerequisite for strengthening the race."

### "Talents Unfulfilled"—Forever Makes Heroes' Sleeves Wet with Tears

— Ding Huikang

The late Dr. Yu Fengbin was a father's friend. He served as the president of the China Medical Association and the vice president of the Physicians' Association. He was familiar with public health and wrote books. Unfortunately, he passed away at the young age of forty-six. Dr. Niu Huisheng served as the president of the Orthopedic Hospital of Zhongshan Hospital and the president of the Chinese Medical Association. He devoted himself to medical affairs and spared no effort, but he passed away before the age of fifty. Dr. Jiang Fengzhi returned to China after World War I and founded Tongde Medical College. His students were all over the country, but he only lived to the age of forty-four. Alas! These three gentlemen are pioneers of our party. When I was a student, I admired the Physician's Code of Ethics compiled by Mr. Yu, which stated, "Formal physicians should promote medical knowledge and popularize public health." Mr. Yan Fqing said that Mr. Niu regretted that he could not devote more effort to public health when he was ill. I, a humble student, wrote it on my belt to remind myself and deeply sighed that the three gentlemen's talents were unfulfilled, which makes people have the feeling of "before the army could set out, the general died; forever, it makes heroes' sleeves wet with tears". Liang Rengong once said: the country is like a salt mountain, if the quality of salt changes, the mountain is still there, but it is just its name, and the country is in danger! Looking at the deterioration of our country's medicine, the decline of the nation, and the decline of national power in the past twenty years, it is almost directly proportional. Mr. Ren Gong's words are indeed not false. The people are the foundation of the country, and health is the driving force of the foundation. A foundation without power is just the name of the people, but there is no country. I am worried for the people of the country! The three gentlemen worked hard for medical affairs, were familiar with public health, and sought the happiness of patients day and night. Their ambitions and deeds were so great, but they neglected their personal health, which led to their inability to live long lives and fulfill their ambitions. What a pity! I think that if they could have undergone health checkups early in their busy lives, prevented things in advance, and eliminated the source of the disease, they could have lived a long life, and their contribution to society would have been unlimited. This is not only a loss to our medical community but also a loss to the country. Since the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people's livelihood has been difficult, and medical problems have become more and more serious. After visiting the United States again, I feel that improving national health is really urgent. If we want to achieve stability, we must start with individuals, from individuals to society, from families to the country. Like building a giant mansion, after the cornerstone is laid, we can build up layer by layer. The so-called "to strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the race, and to strengthen the people, we must start with our own health" means that everyone must strictly implement early examinations, obtain accurate diagnoses, and prevent problems before they occur, so as to achieve the goals of guaranteeing health, saving medical expenses, and stabilizing society. Health checkups are so important! All my countrymen should not treat these words lightly! If we promote it and implement universal examinations, we will eliminate latent disease sources and wash away the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia".

### Ballad of the Soldier Poet

— Fan Shouwu

Before discussing "Soldier Poetry," we must understand that the term "soldier" is not limited to certain people—now that conscription is practiced, everyone has the obligation to be a soldier—in ancient times, from the emperor to the common people, as long as they had experienced battles and worn armor on the battlefield, those "from the ranks" could be called "soldiers." From this classification method, I can assert that the founding father of "Soldier Poetry" should be Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty, Liu Bang. His representative work, "The great wind rises, the clouds fly, my might extends over the land, returning to my hometown, how can I get brave warriors to guard the four quarters?" (Ode to the Great Wind), is quite sufficient to stand alone for thousands of years. Although Xiang Yu's "My strength plucked up the hills, my might overshadowed the world, but the time is against me, and the horse does not fare forth, and since the horse does not fare forth, what is to be done? O Yu, what is to be done?" appeared before Liu Bang's "Ode to the Great Wind," it ultimately suffered from its depiction of a hero's final days and his tender feelings, causing it to become melancholic and lingering, which had already lost the original face of "Soldier Poetry." Thus, in selecting the master of the "Soldier Poetry" altar, we have to abandon Xiang and return to Liu, and endure the pain of reluctantly parting.

As for the poetry of Li Ling and Su Wu, and the verses of the Cao family, father and sons, which followed, there are countless capable poets who are also refined and handsome generals. They are all tempered and polished hundreds of times, and their meter and structure are strict, which is very different from the style of "Soldier Poetry," so they are not discussed. From the Han and Tang Dynasties down, browsing through hundreds of schools, Song Taizu—Zhao Kuangyin—is unique. When he was unknown, he once composed a poem "Sun," saying, "Wanting to come out but not coming out, the light flickers, thousands of mountains and ten thousand mountains burn like fire. In a moment, it rushes to the sky, chasing away the remnant stars and chasing the bright moon." The tone of a rough fellow, the heroic chant of a soldier, is truly a superior work in "Soldier Poetry." As for Emperor Ming Taizu Zhu Yuanzhang's poem "Chrysanthemum," "When a hundred flowers bloom, I do not bloom; when I bloom, they are all frightened. I want to fight a battle with the west wind, and my whole body is clad in golden armor." Its imposing manner is arrogant and has the sound of "drumming and striking gold." Even if Li and Du were reborn, they could not say a word about it. This is why "Soldier Poetry" is unique for thousands of years.

As for the Qing Dynasty's unofficial history, it is recorded that during the Yongzheng period, a certain Manchu was a great general. Once, he was released to the two Jiangs, and his comrades in Beijing held a banquet to see him off. During the banquet, the hosts presented parting works, which inspired the general, who picked up a pen and wrote a poem: "I, the old man, ride a horse down to Jiangnan, the young men of Jiangnan laugh and welcome me. Knowing that I am the old man, add a horizontal stroke to make Heaven!" The meaning is to boast that he is below one person and above ten thousand people. However, the paper is full of fishy smell and vulgarity, which flows into the demonic path of "Soldier Poetry"!

### Looking at the Imperial Court

— John

A few emperors under the age of ten.

In the past, emperors were the highest leaders of the country. The people's sufferings and the nation's safety were all in the hands of one person. This kind of position is not easy to assume unless they have extraordinary abilities. However, when we examine Chinese history, there were emperors who ascended the throne as children. It is simply an absurd joke to have yellow-haired kids who are still wet behind the ears become emperors who rule the entire country. Now, let's bring out the emperors from the Han Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty who were under the age of ten, so that everyone can have a laugh.

Emperor Zhao of the Western Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of eight, reigned for thirteen years, and died at the age of twenty-two.

Emperor Ping of the Western Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of nine, reigned for five years, and was poisoned by Wang Mang.

Emperor He of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of ten, reigned for seventeen years, and died at the age of twenty-seven.

Emperor Shang of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at one hundred days old, and only lived to be two years old.

Emperor Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of two, and only lived to be one or two years old.

Emperor Zhi of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of eight, reigned for one year, and was poisoned by Liang Ji.

Emperor Xian of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of nine and later abdicated to the Wei Dynasty (not voluntarily).

King Qi of Wei, ascended the throne at the age of nine and was later deposed by Sima Shi.

King Kuaiji of Wu, ascended the throne at the age of nine and committed suicide at the age of sixteen.

Emperor Cheng of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of five, reigned for seventeen years, and died at the age of twenty-two.

Emperor Mu of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of two, reigned for seventeen years, and died at the age of nineteen.

Emperor Shun of the Five Dynasties Song Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of seven, reigned for three years, and died at the age of ten.

Emperor Gaozong of the Northern Wei Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of two, reigned for fourteen years, and died at the age of sixteen.

Emperor Gaozu of the Northern Wei Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of four, and died at the age of thirty-two.

Emperor Xuanwu of the Northern Wei Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of five, and died at the age of nineteen.

Emperor Jing of Zhou, ascended the throne at the age of eight and died at the age of nine.

Emperor Gong of the Later Zhou Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of seven, reigned for six months, and had to give it to the Song Dynasty.

Emperor Zhezong of the Song Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of ten, and died at the age of twenty-five.

Emperor Gong of the Song Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of five, reigned for two years, and surrendered to the Yuan Dynasty.

Emperor Bing of the Song Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of seven, reigned for two years, and Lu Xiufu carried him and threw himself into the sea to die.

Emperor Ningzong of the Yuan Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of seven, ascended the throne in October and died in November.

Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of eight, and died at the age of fifty-six.

### Talking about White Fungus in Winter

— Xiutang

Autumn passes and winter comes. On the advertisement column of the newspaper, advertisements for soliciting white fungus customers occupy a prominent position again. White fungus belongs to the Auriculariales family of Basidiomycetes and parasitizes on the decaying parts of moist-leaved trees. After the rain in spring and autumn, fruiting bodies occur, the larger ones being two or three inches in size, shaped like human ears.

The trees parasitized by white fungus are mostly Qinglei trees. Between winter and summer, mountain peddlers rent mountains, cut down trees, and remove all branches and leaves. Then, the trunks are cut into sections, each about two feet long. Then, they are erected in order in a place where the soil is fertile but not humid. By the fifth and sixth months of the lunar calendar, after the cultivation of the environment and climate, wood ears grow on the tree bark. At this time, the wood ears can be picked, removing the dregs and broken ones, and cutting off the tree bark. After washing and re-selection, pure wood ears are obtained. Then, they are dried with fire. Generally, high-quality goods (those produced in summer) weigh only one or two taels after drying per catty. Autumn goods weigh four catties, and only one or two taels are obtained after drying. Chen Shan goods (i.e., those produced last year) weigh eight catties, and only one or two taels are obtained after drying. This is why white fungus is expensive.

Those who are fond of white fungus mostly season it with sugar. According to doctors, the effects of seasoning with rock sugar or with white sugar are different. Eating it with rock sugar can nourish the lungs, dissolve the intestines, dissolve hair, and eating it with white sugar can treat red and white dysentery, female yin deficiency, and various gynecological diseases. Therefore, wealthy families use eating white fungus as a tonic in winter. However, according to the analysis of chemists, the nutrients in white fungus are not high. The results of the analysis are as follows:

Carbohydrates 68.01%

Fat 3.12%

Protein 6.51%

Ash 5.51%

Calcium 0.643%

Phosphorus 0.250%

Iron 0.0304%

The protein content of white fungus is very low, and it obviously has no value in providing protein. Although the carbohydrate content is high, there is absolutely no possibility of lacking this nutrient in food. Therefore, we do not need to use expensive white fungus to provide this easily available carbohydrate. The inorganic salts contained in white fungus can be said to be very abundant, the most abundant being calcium, followed by phosphorus and iron. However, it is too uneconomical to use this expensive food to provide this source of minerals.

### Embroidery Belt Tunes - Two Lyrics

— Hu Lu

In Fuzhou, the custom of abandoning infants is rampant. A few days ago, wild dogs were discovered eating live infants. I still remember that at the beginning of this year, a similar tragedy occurred in Nanjing. Considering the large number of abandoned infants across the country, often reported in newspapers, it's hard to guarantee they won't be eaten by dogs. People either don't see it, or even if they do, no one reports it. If the unknown number could be tallied, it would be shocking. It truly makes one feel, "What kind of world is this?" Therefore, I fill these lyrics as a lament—

Remember in Nanjing, wild dogs eating abandoned infants. Unexpectedly, in Fuzhou city, the dogs are equally fierce! Should small lives be so lightly, heartlessly sacrificed? What era is this? One's own flesh and blood, devoid of love and filled with cruelty!

It's not just Fuzhou city, abandoned infants are everywhere. Reports are often continuously published, the numbers difficult to clarify! Wild dogs, with hungry teeth, contend, how terrifying, a heartrending cry! Born in a decadent world, beasts that eat humans, roam freely in broad daylight!

### Inside and Outside the "Prison"

— Yi Feng

Everyone knows that prisons are established for those who have committed crimes.

For a person to go from the free world into the narrow prison gates is, of course, a misfortune, a disaster, a tragedy. A person who has never been in prison cannot experience the vastness of the world outside the prison; only those who have been in prison can understand the hardships of prison life.

Whether in ancient or modern times, whether in China or abroad, "prisons" are ultimately no different.

Gu Dazhang of the late Ming Dynasty recorded his prison life, saying, "Once entering the imperial prison, all sounds and information are distant and cannot be seen face to face, which is as good as death." He Yu Zhang said, "In the imperial prison, writing a note to request food and drink from outside is like the manifestation of ancestors; family members delivering food is like descendants offering sacrifices." Thus, he finally sighed with emotion: "How can one make such a depiction if not confined to prison for a long time?"

The great English writer Oscar Wilde spent two years in prison for male homosexual acts, which led him to a painful curse of prisons. He said, "The prisons of humanity, each is built of bricks of shame, and surrounded by fences for fear that Christ might see how people mistreat their brothers." He also said, "The organization of prisons is absolutely and completely wrong."

Yet, the reality is precisely this: "Where there is sorrow, there is holiness." When people are thrown from the free world into the "unfree" prison, they naturally feel the greatest pain, but pain is not necessarily an enlightenment. People rely on it to recognize things they had not recognized before.

Gu Dazhang was framed and imprisoned for offending the eunuch Wei Zhongxian over a boat, and in the end, he could not avoid being harmed by Wei's clique. However, his integrity grew stronger with each setback, and he did not beg for mercy or surrender to Wei.

After Wilde was released from prison, he himself admitted that it was the second turning point in his life. He devoted all his energy to writing his last masterpiece, "The Ballad of Reading Gaol." People universally recognize that this work was produced after he encountered the miserable and cruel reality of life in prison for two years. It is filled with humanitarian sentiment and is even compared to Dante's Inferno and praised as "the most beautiful poem written in English."

Naturally, no one in the world would use these facts to encourage others to go to prison; otherwise, only a madman would do so. Moreover, throughout history, no one has voluntarily thrown themselves into prison to "enjoy" the suffering of that hell on earth. However, the reality is so terrifying today. According to a report in Shanghai, a young man in dire straits in Shanghai, known as the Paris of the East, actually went to the court and insisted on being imprisoned when he had no way out. This is not only frightening but also inevitably evokes a sense of "What kind of world is this!"

### The Five Great Dangers of Mankind

— Chai Fei

Dr. Shapley, the director of the Harvard University Observatory, recently declared that human culture is suffering from the threat of powerful physics and weak sociology, fleeing in despair with almost nowhere to hide. With a humorous tone, Dr. Shapley further pointed out the five major dangers of mankind: "Geniuses who want to control the present and the future, guiding the world towards destruction; narcotics that extinguish desire or reproductive ability; having leisure and feeling bored; super-weapons that provoke new wars due to infighting; and epidemics spreading around the world."

Dr. Shapley believes that to overcome the five major dangers of mankind, a global universal education plan should be established under the guidance of the UNESCO, and it should be actively implemented with strong support. Shapley said: If we have no way to do this, the only way to save ourselves from the control of geniuses is to kill infants who are born with genius traits cleanly.

### Miss America

### Miss America's Birthday

— Xu Shuyuan

Because a woman's youth is especially precious, she attaches particular importance to her birthday. American material civilization surpasses any other country, and Miss America is especially unwilling to let go of celebrating her birthday. She does not send out invitations in advance but verbally informs acquaintances when she encounters them, generally saying, "Such and such date is my birthday, please come to my house to play." If they are more familiar, they will ask: "What do you plan to give me?" Sometimes she is honest and not shy, specifying that you give her a powder compact or an expensive pen, or even a watch or a silver fox coat, depending on the relationship. Gifts of watches and silver fox coats are limited to those with intimate relationships, such as spouses, lovers, etc. Ordinary friends giving a (Birthday Card) is considered to have fulfilled their obligations. Giving generous gifts is very rare; giving cards is the majority. She pastes the cards in a photo album or scrapbook, as a meaningful souvenir. Parents give their daughters gemstone birthday rings, leather coats, pianos, or even cars for their birthdays, especially their seventeenth or twentieth birthdays. Don't think that giving pianos and cars is something amazing. Pianos are only worth two or three hundred US dollars. A 1947 model car costs about one thousand six or seven hundred US dollars.

On the day of the birthday, a specific birthday cake is prepared. If someone sends one, you don't need to prepare it yourself. Many birthday candles are inserted on the cake. Many relatives, classmates, and neighbors are invited to have a party, to eat (Cocktail) (Yangjingbang English experts translate as "chicken tail wine"). According to custom, all the guests stand around the birthday cake, holding plates. Miss America blows out all the candles in one breath, and then everyone shares the birthday cake. After the cake is eaten, either dinner is served, or only refreshments are provided. The party is held for dancing. Each guest must dance with the birthday girl once to show that they have arrived with a gift. Often, her feet become sore from dancing, and it is common for several pairs of silk stockings to be torn.

Misses from middle-class families can receive many gifts for their birthdays. Would you say they violate the principle of thrift? That would be nitpicking. Because the gifts are all practical items and are not wasted. Americans never send flower-patterned silver shields, nor do they rely on servants, so there is no expenditure on tips. I believe that propriety in the virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame is very important. Giving gifts should of course be included in propriety; otherwise, greeting with bows and hand gestures would make that kind of propriety become hypocrisy, and hypocrisy is shamelessness. Austerity movements should be limited to practical gifts, and not overthrowing the etiquette. If we don't forget the past, even the chairman's birthday will see people casting golden statues. Isn't this "propriety"? However, the government should sanction unscrupulous merchants who raise the prices of goods, but don't just talk and do nothing; otherwise, please remain silent. (10)(6)

Social Services

Shen Bao, in partnership with Renhe Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Baoli Hospital, and Shangxian Relief Society Hospital, co-organizes assisted childbirth for poor women.

Mr. Jinhua Feng bears half the cost single-handedly, his enthusiasm is admirable.

This newspaper, in partnership with Renhe, the First Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian, Baoli and other four hospitals, is conducting a "Poor Women Assisted Childbirth" movement. All expenses are borne equally by the cooperating hospitals and this newspaper. In other words, the medical expenses for each parturient woman are borne half by the hospital authorities and half by this newspaper. With the needs of society, the "Poor Women Assisted Childbirth" movement is expanding day by day, and the number of hospitals cooperating with us has increased from one, "Renhe," to four. But at the same time, we are also facing an urgent problem - the funding problem. The assisted childbirth funds of this newspaper have always been donated by enthusiastic readers. However, due to the changes in currency value and the continuous rise in medical equipment prices, we are constantly worried about the inability to balance the budget. Fortunately, Mr. Jinhua Feng gave us warm encouragement and support when we felt difficulties. He generously agreed to donate the assisted childbirth expenses that this newspaper should bear each month. The assisted childbirth expenses handled by the "Renhe" and "Shangxian" hospitals in October were 12,587,500 yuan. This museum should pay half of the amount, totaling 6,293,750 yuan. This amount has been paid in full by Mr. Jin, and the relevant officials have received it from the two hospitals. As for Baoli and the First Red Cross Hospital...

We believe that in this society, the number of people who sponsor the "Poor Women Assisted Childbirth" movement is definitely not limited to Mr. Jin. We respectfully and sincerely hope for the encouragement and donations of enthusiastic people so that countless poor parturient women and infants can receive safe protection.
