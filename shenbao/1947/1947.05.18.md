### Fierce Battles in the Mountainous Areas of Shandong; Communist Northeast Army Destroys Transportation; Liang Huasheng and Others Inspect New Jilin

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 17th] On the 16th, at 13:00 hours, the Nationalist army captured Fangshan, north of Mengyin, annihilating one Communist regiment. The situation in the Yimeng Mountains battle zone may become clearer in a day or two.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 17th] The remaining main force of the Shandong Communist army, approximately 180,000 men, has now all fled and gathered in the central area of Mengyin, Yishui, and Ju County in the southern Shandong Yimeng Mountain area. The Nationalist army has now completed a new encirclement deployment and launched a large-scale annihilation battle. The mountain area war was extremely fierce on the 17th. There have been no changes in Jiaodong. The Communist army is continuously using speedboats and other means to transport munitions from Yantai, Weihaiwei, and the coastal areas south of Qingdao, which shows that the Communist army intends to occupy Shandong for a long time.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 16th] The great battle in Shandong province is raging in the four-corner area of Yishui, Ju County, Tangtou Town, and Mengyin. The Communist army has concentrated the forces of the Second, Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Columns, attempting to cut off the Lin-Meng Highway and attack the rear of the Nationalist army. In order to annihilate the main force of the Communist army, the Nationalist army has temporarily postponed the original plan to attack Zibo and join forces with Wang Yaowu's troops and instead used its main force to counter-encircle the Communist army in that area. The focus of the war has thus shifted south. Since the 14th, the battle has lasted for three days and nights. The Communist army's casualties have reached over 20,000. Therefore, it is generally estimated that, barring unforeseen changes, the battle in that area will inevitably bring about a decisive development for the overall situation in Shandong.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 16th] The outskirts of Jinan are calm. The Nationalist army on the eastern route is still continuing to mop up sporadic Communist troops near Zaoyuan Temple, west of Mingshui. The Tusi Kou area is also strengthening fortifications and repairing roads west of He Village. It is too early to say that Mingshui and Qingshi Pass have been recovered and that the army has reached the vicinity of Boshan.

[Special Dispatch from Changchun, This Newspaper, 17th] The Communist army invading Jilin has suffered setbacks, and the situation is still calm. The Communist army gathered on the outskirts of Jiaohe and Ula Street has not taken any action.

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 17th] The Nationalist army on the Ula Street side of the northern Jilin Jiang River is in an isolated state. The air force is dispatched to assist in the Jilin area. Faku, which is far to the south, is also surrounded by the Communist army. Faku is 70 kilometers from Shenyang. Reinforcement by the Nationalist army can stabilize it.

[Special Dispatch from Changchun, This Newspaper, 17th] HuaiDe experienced fierce artillery battles all day yesterday. The Communist army launched more than 20 fierce attacks, and one unit broke in from the west, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat. However, the Nationalist army is still tenaciously defending HuaiDe city. The Nationalist army, moving north along the west side of the Changchun-Dalian Railway to relieve HuaiDe, has now reached an area 20 li from the city and is expected to join forces. Reinforcements from Changchun are also making progress.

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 17th] There have been fierce battles in the area 30 kilometers north of Gongzhuling on the Changchun-Dalian Railway and in various strongholds near HuaiDe. The vicinity of Qingyuan on the Shenyang-Haikou Road is also tense.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] The Communist army in northern Songhua, which suffered setbacks in attacking the city, has again begun to use the technique of destroying railway transportation in the Jilin-Changchun area. A small number of troops in northern Nongan detoured south and destroyed a bridge 46 kilometers north of Changchun on the northern section of the Changchun-Dalian Railway before dawn on the 17th, and also destroyed the Tianjia River Bridge north of Buhai (61 kilometers north of Changchun), cutting off the connection between Buhai and Dehui. A unit also invaded the Buhai station.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 17th] The advance troops of the Communist army attacking the strongholds on the outskirts of Jilin City have retreated to the north of Erdaolingzi after being counterattacked by the Nationalist army. There are currently no traces of the Communist army near Jilin.

[China News Agency, Jilin, 16th] At 6:00 AM this morning, I accompanied Liang Huasheng, Chairman of Jilin, Chen Fengren, Deputy Commander of the New Eighth Army, and others to inspect the front lines of New Jilin in light rain. After days of sweeping by the Nationalist army, the Communist army has been forced to retreat to the northern mountainous area, and the city is gradually returning to normal.

### Nationalist Army Adopts "Wait and See" Strategy; General Pan Yukun Reviews the Battle Situation

[Special Dispatch from Changchun, This Newspaper, 17th] Sun Liren will postpone his arrival in Changchun after arriving in Shenyang. The memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the New First Army, originally scheduled for the 19th, has also been postponed.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] General Pan Yukun, Commander of the New First Army, delivered a radio address to the citizens of Changchun on the evening of the 16th, reviewing the current battle situation, saying that the Nationalist army is adopting a "wait and see" strategy. If the Communist army dares to go deep, then "we are absolutely confident in annihilating them in one fell swoop." Pan also said: Changchun does not dare to come, but hopes that he will come so that they can wipe them out in one fell swoop. In his broadcast, Pan gave a brief account of the war situation in various places. According to him: (1) In the Jilin area, the Communist army's Sixth Column and Cao Lihai's troops once sneaked into Tuchengzi and Sanquanzi on the other side of the Jilin River. After a Nationalist army unit came out to intercept them, it surrounded and annihilated more than 2,000 of them. The Communist army has now retreated more than 20 li away, and the Nationalist army is pursuing and annihilating them. (2) In the Nongan area, they were initially surrounded on three sides, but after a fierce battle, the Communist army knew it was difficult and retreated. In addition to suffering heavy casualties, more than 40 people were captured by the Nationalist army. There are now no traces of the Communist army within 25 li of the city. (3) The Dehui area is calm and uneventful. However, the food of the people in the Kaoshantun area in the northwest of the county has been robbed. (4) In the HuaiDe area, the Communist army's First and Second Columns (including six divisions), the Independent Brigade, and the Mongolian Cavalry began to attack at 3:00 AM on the 14th. Within one day, 3,000 people were annihilated. At that time, a battalion of the Communist army broke into the pocket-shaped area of the Nationalist army and was completely annihilated by the Nationalist army. On the 15th, the Communist army attacked again and was repelled. At noon today, there was a fierce artillery battle. The Nationalist army suffered very few casualties. The city has sufficient food and ammunition, and the morale of the garrison is high. There is no problem in fighting for another ten or twenty days. According to General Pan, this time the Communist army is scattered, its harassment force is weak, and its fighting will is not as strong as before. According to his judgment, the purpose of this Communist army harassment is to loot food and conscript young men. A lot of food and young men near Nongan have been robbed. Pan also asserted that the Communist army has "few soldiers and weak strength and cannot have big ambitions." Finally, Pan urged the citizens to stick to their posts, work with peace of mind, and listen for good news.

Citizens are driven to suicide by drowning due to the pressure of life.

### The Nationalist Army that Recovered Laiyuan Continues to Expand Outward

[Special Dispatch from Baoding, This Newspaper, 17th] The mopping-up battle in the Taihang Mountains has begun. After the Cavalry Division of Chahar Province captured Laiyuan, it continued to expand its offensive outward. The Communist army in the area of Yu County, Lingqiu, and Gao Ping is forcing the transportation of materials day and night to cover the southward movement of military vehicles. In addition, the Nationalist army in the Baoding-Mancheng area in western Hebei is responding to the southward movement. The Chahar provincial corps is currently deploying to launch a pincer attack on the Zao Ping front line, waiting for an opportunity to advance westward.

### Wang Yunwu Invites Political Committee Members to Discuss the Executive Yuan's Work Report to the Council; the Agenda of the Council Will Focus on the Economy

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 17th] Wang Yunwu, Deputy Dean of the Executive Yuan, invited the political committee members Zhang Lisheng, Wang Shijie, Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, Lei Zhen, and others to hold a small group meeting at his residence at 5:00 PM on the 17th to discuss the content of the Executive Yuan's work report in the Political Participation Council. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 17th] It is reported that the central topic of this Political Participation Council meeting will be the economy, followed by politics. This reporter recently interviewed Yin Shuxian, a resident member of the Council, and asked for his thoughts on the current situation. Yin said: "I personally believe that the current problem is that the economy is more important than politics. If the economy is stabilized, social order will naturally be easier to put on track. In recent years, prices have soared, the cost of living is too high, and the value of the legal currency is declining. Therefore, I will propose to the conference to reform the currency system, stabilize finance, and stabilize people's livelihood; the so-called reform of the currency system is to adopt the gold standard and issue new currency." Yin described his method, if it can be adopted by the government and implemented in the short term, I believe that even during the war, it is still a very effective way to stabilize the economy. Yin's proposal is in its final revision and can be submitted soon.

Shao also said: He very much agreed with the opinions on peace put forward by Zhou Binglin and others.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 17th] Registration for the Political Participation Council was on the third day, the 17th.

### The Number of Legislators in Shanghai is Based on Constitutional Provisions; Liu Kejun Said that According to Population Calculation, Only Seven Can be Obtained

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 17th] People from all walks of life in Shanghai believe that it is unfair that Shanghai only occupies seven seats in the distribution of legislative seats in various provinces and municipalities. This reporter visited Liu Kejun, Chairman of the Constitutional Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, on the 17th to ask for his opinion on this point. According to the conversation: The number of legislators is based on the provisions of Article 64 of the Constitution. Each province and municipality directly under the Central Government with a population of 3 million or more will elect five people, and those with a population exceeding 3 million will elect one additional person for every 1 million people. The population of Shanghai is calculated based on the 20th calendar year (the highest population year in the 15 years from the 16th to the 31st year of the Republic of China), with a total of 5,025,621 people, and seven legislators can be elected. The Constitution stipulates this, so it is inconvenient to change it without authorization. The reporter asked whether it is unfair that the population of Shenyang and other places is less than one-fifth of that of Shanghai, but the number of legislators elected is only two less than that of Shanghai. Liu said that the Constitution stipulates this, and it is inevitable to suffer losses and cheapness. The reporter informed him that Jin Zhenyu, a member of the National Political Participation Council, pointed out that the total amount of taxes paid in Shanghai accounts for about 40% of the total national tax revenue, while the number of legislators it occupies accounts for only about 0.9% of the total of 622, which is really unfair. Liu said that the country once adopted a method of determining the number of elected people based on the amount of tax paid, but it is no longer used, and no other country uses this system. As for the Shanghai quota problem, in the future, it may be possible to remedy it in the election of professional representatives. For example, if the number of members of professional groups in Shanghai is larger, the number of legislators elected in the city can be increased.

### Education Minister Zhu's Written Speech; Hopes that Students will Understand the Difficult Times; The Government Adopts All Reasonable Requests

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Education Minister Zhu Jiajia recently issued the following written speech: Recently, student trends have started in various places, and the situation is deteriorating. The issues raised are nothing more than (1) those involving the education system and administration, (2) students' own lives, and (3) school facilities. These are explained separately as follows:

(1) Those involving the education system and administration, such as demanding the relocation of schools, requesting changes in the education system, etc., except for the fact that most of them are not true and are based on mishearing rumors and creating something out of nothing, there is no need to investigate. Regarding all school systems, this department has always been very cautious. For example, the distribution of schools above the junior college level and the establishment of colleges and junior colleges all have detailed plans, which are submitted to various education conferences for discussion, and educational experts have racked their brains to form resolutions and implement them. It is well known that the concentration of universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin is unreasonable. This restoration should be a timely systematic review and a reasonable adjustment. If schools are not run in the mainland due to the breadth of our country's territory, and are still allowed to concentrate in a few large cities, this is to disregard the education, science, and culture of the interior, and is no different from making the people unaware of the real situation of the country, and making education isolated from our vast rural society. At the time of education restoration, this department originally wanted to keep most of the colleges and universities in the mainland. Due to factual difficulties, it had to consider the situation and move back a large part, but it must not allow education to develop abnormally for a long time, and completely disregard the principle of balance, resulting in the actual needs of national construction being lost. As for junior colleges wanting to be changed to colleges, and colleges wanting to be changed to universities, this is a matter of the education system and must be determined according to their needs and equipment, and whether the faculty is sufficient. If the necessary conditions are not met, once a request is made, it will be changed, which is not only a misnomer, but will also mislead young people. This is why this department is unwilling to act rashly and researches step-by-step handling.

(2) Student's own living problems. Regarding the increase in public funding, the public funding system was originally a wartime relief measure set up for young students who retreated from the front to the rear. At that time, it was clearly stipulated that it would end at the end of the war. In order to attach importance to young people's studies, the government has repeatedly expanded the number of public funding places. After the end of the war, it still remembered the economic situation of students' parents during the recovery period. Not only did it not cancel public funding for old students, but it also allowed new students to apply for public funding. Although its quota has a rule of gradual reduction year by year, all students who already have public funding continue to receive it until graduation. It can be said that they are extremely cared for and have not been seen in other countries. Our country was originally a poor country, and the economic difficulties after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War are self-evident. Maintaining public funding has exhausted the greatest effort. What's more, there are many among the 450 million compatriots who are unable to enroll. Publicly funded students in universities are already special in receiving publicly funded treatment. Public funding is originally divided into two parts. Each person receives 2.3 dou of rice per month, which is issued according to the local market price and is not affected by materials. The non-staple food cost is calculated at one-seventh of the living allowance for public education personnel. After the adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel this time, such as the public funded students in the Beijing-Shanghai area, in addition to 2.3 dou of rice, the non-staple food cost has increased from 24,000 yuan per month to 48,000 yuan. Other places have also increased according to regulations, and public funding is adjusted according to the principle of adjusting the treatment of public education personnel every three months. The government handles things based on the actual situation. Furthermore, it has been found that there is already a situation in our country where it is "more difficult to enter middle school than elementary school, and more difficult to enter university than middle school." It is the lightest burden for children to enter university, and the children of those who pay for it may not even have the opportunity to study. This is unique to our country and is a heartbreaking thing. I hope that publicly funded university students will understand the heavy burden on the country and the suffering of ordinary people, understand the country's financial difficulties, and strive to concentrate on their studies, so that they will not disappoint the country's expectations.

(3) School equipment problems. This problem is indeed more serious and should be admitted frankly. However, we must know that before the Anti-Japanese War, the equipment of schools at all levels was not very abundant. Most schools were just humble and barely capable of teaching. Not only was it impossible to replenish them during the Anti-Japanese War, but too much was lost due to relocation, enemy looting, bombing, and other reasons. At present, the number of people in schools at all levels has generally increased more than twice as much as before the war. It is not easy to massively replenish equipment in a short period of time and under extremely difficult circumstances. As a result of this department's efforts in various ways over the years, the situation in various schools can generally be said to have improved a lot compared to the Anti-Japanese War. This department and colleagues responsible for education administration at all levels will strive to make educational equipment increasingly substantial. It is our duty and we will not slack off. In short, the government adopts all reasonable requests and proper suggestions, and this department will do its best to achieve them. However, observing the recent student unrest, they often strike and march, coerce and petition, and become accustomed to arrogance, which is almost incomprehensible. Passers-by look at it with disapproval, and teachers are even more heartbroken, affecting social order and exceeding the scope of education. A few conspiratorial instigations hinder the studies of the majority, and they are planned acts of sabotage. The methods and excuses they adopt are exactly the same. If this trend is not stopped, education will be in great danger. I sincerely hope that students' parents will restrain young children and not allow them to abandon their studies, and I hope that enthusiastic educational people and society will guide them together. What direction should today's youth strive for? What will they do if they do not study? The vast majority of our pure students, quickly wake up! Think carefully, discern clearly, and develop reason, explore the truth, understand the general situation, understand the great righteousness, recognize the times, firmly guard your own study position, and do not fall into an irredeemable situation!

### Temporary Meeting of the National Government Committee Discusses Methods for Handling Student Protests Across the Country

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Government Committee has scheduled a temporary meeting for 10:00 AM on the 18th to discuss pressing current issues. In addition to finalizing the selection of the Minister of Economic Affairs and other matters, the meeting will also discuss methods for handling the student strike movement. It is rumored that the government will not interfere with student movements that stay within established boundaries, but will handle any transgressive activities according to the law. Decisions are expected at the meeting on the 18th, and a stern statement will be released afterward.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A person in charge of the Executive Yuan recently gave a speech regarding the issue of public-funded supplementary food expenses, explaining the government's painstaking efforts in this measure, stating: "Under today's financial circumstances, the government has truly made its utmost efforts. To further increase the funds for supplementary food expenses for publicly funded students and expand the number of publicly funded students, considering the current capacity of the national treasury, it is genuinely impossible to bear the burden. The government is actively seeking to increase revenue and stabilize prices. Until stability is achieved, salaries will be adjusted every three months. The reasonable living standards for publicly funded students will still be maintained to the best of our ability. If a minority of students fail to understand the government's painstaking care and protectiveness, and obstruct public order, the government has a responsibility to safeguard social security and order, and must, on the one hand, instruct the authorities of the respective schools to be responsible for guidance and prevention, and on the other hand, order the security organs to earnestly perform their duties. It is hoped that our pure and innocent young students will restrain their emotions, appreciate the difficulties of the times, prioritize the nation, prioritize their studies, and not be overly激越 (jiyue - excited/impassioned) and violate discipline, causing pain to their loved ones and joy to their enemies. This would be most fortunate!"

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Li Zongren is scheduled to convene a discussion meeting with the presidents of various colleges and universities at 4:00 PM on the 18th, hoping to eliminate the student protests.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] 138 representatives from Peking University's various departments and faculties held a meeting this afternoon at 3:00 PM, which adjourned at 7:00 PM. The meeting put forward numerous demands. In addition to announcing today an increase in student supplementary food expenses and the cancellation of the general examination, Peking University also issued a notice in vernacular Chinese, discouraging strikes. The last paragraph reads: "As for the students' freedom to express their opinions on current political issues, we naturally do not oppose it, but political issues are complex and cannot be resolved in the short term, nor can student strikes immediately achieve results. Therefore, we sincerely hope that students will seriously consider this and not sacrifice their studies to make political demands." This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Hu also convened a school affairs meeting at his private residence. According to Secretary-General Zheng Huachi, the meeting adopted a policy of persuasion regarding the strike. Official sources here report that students will march tomorrow, and preparations have been made.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Tsinghua University students went on strike today. The student union mobilized to Haidian, posting slogans, giving speeches, and performing propaganda plays. The private Fu Jen Catholic University remained calm. Students at China University and North China College opposed the strike, blaming the Chinese Communist Party for the war.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 17th] Zhejiang University began a strike today. Six student representatives departed for Nanjing by car this afternoon at 2:00 PM. In addition, over twenty student representatives from Zhejiang's eight normal schools petitioned the provincial government to improve the treatment of normal school students. Moreover, for the sake of demanding freedom of speech at the university and opposing the 種點制 (zhongdian zhi - possibly a system of monitoring student behavior), Zhejiang University suspended classes for one day yesterday. Zhejiang Provincial Medical College requested to be upgraded to a National Medical College.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Promulgates Measures for Pacifying the People; Has Telegraphed Instructions to All Counties and Cities to Comply; Provincial Assembly Telegraphed to Chairman Requesting the Enactment of Laws to Stabilize Order

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 17th] The Provincial Government has recently promulgated measures for pacifying the people and urgently telegraphed instructions to all counties and cities to comply: (1) Labor and management must strive for coordination, work together harmoniously, stabilize order, and avoid labor unrest. (2) Principals, teachers, and staff members should properly guide students, enabling them to study peacefully and prevent cunning parties from infiltrating and inciting trouble. (3) Local order should be firmly ensured by the respective county magistrates in conjunction with the stationed troops and defense corps. (4) The people's food problem should be given genuine attention to clear grain sources and stabilize grain prices, and they should be held responsible for ensuring that there is rice available for purchase, preventing social unrest. (5) People's representative bodies and local governments must coordinate consistently and take unified steps to maintain the overall situation.

[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 17th] The Jiangsu Provincial Assembly recently telegraphed Chairman Chiang, saying: "After the great war, vitality is exhausted. All measures should prioritize maintaining social order. Any actions that directly or indirectly hinder the above requirements, such as strikes, class boycotts, and rice looting, must be swiftly and effectively prevented by the government.

### At the Welcome Meeting of All Circles in Taiwan, Wei Daoming Urges Compatriots in Taiwan to Cooperate More with the Government; Mutual Suspicion Should Be Removed Urgently

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] Wei Daoming attended the welcome meeting of all circles in the province yesterday. During the meeting, Huang Chaoqin, Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, delivered a speech first, expressing his support for Wei's announced policy of "prioritizing stability in all measures." He also stated: "Many talented people from across the province have already been recruited as provincial government committee members and department heads. In the future, officials and the people will definitely be able to cooperate effectively." Wei then elaborated in his half-hour speech on the deep impression he had gained, namely that the national consciousness of the compatriots had not weakened even slightly due to being under Japanese rule. Moreover, the foreign public and teaching personnel currently in Taiwan do not have any sense of superiority. He emphasized: "All psychological mutual suspicions are wrong. We are all family and brothers and should understand each other urgently." He then urged compatriots in Taiwan to cooperate more with the government, citing as an example: "The current problem of rising grain prices caused by the large-scale smuggling of food out of the country has made the lives of the majority of people difficult, but the strength of the investigation personnel is limited. If the people of the entire province jointly prevent this, satisfactory results will be obtained." Wei finally publicly announced the five new measures decided upon this morning, effective from today, and added: "The lifting of martial law will allow the people to resume normal lives and enjoy the protection of peacetime laws. However, for the remaining small number of ringleaders of the February 28th Incident who are still in hiding, we hope that they will voluntarily surrender to the court and await its judgment. For those who blindly followed, we hope that they will return home immediately, and we will not pursue the matter. Furthermore, after the rural cleansing work concludes today, if there are still privately held firearms among the people, they should be voluntarily surrendered to the government. Otherwise, if discovered, they will definitely be prosecuted." Furthermore, Ge Jing'en, the former Secretary-General of the Chief Executive's Office, also gave a farewell broadcast yesterday, elaborating on Chen Yi's two major policies for governing Taiwan, namely economic construction and spiritual construction, stating that the living standards and knowledge levels of the compatriots in Taiwan must be improved, and hoping that the compatriots in Taiwan will continue to complete these two tasks under the leadership of Chairman Wei.

### Xi'an Manufacturers Consider the Overall Situation, Willing to Allocate and Sell Flour at Low Prices

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 17th] After the price of flour in Xi'an jumped from 79,000 yuan to 104,000 yuan after the last evaluation, public opinion unanimously criticized it.

The remaining 40% will be universally allocated to civilians at 75,000 yuan per bag. Manufacturers have been willing to accept this with a heavy heart in order to prioritize the overall situation. Fortunately, wheat prices have been trending downward in recent days. The wheat harvest will likely be available in about ten days, and the harvest is predicted to be excellent.

Weekly Forum

### Education is Too Turbulent!

— Zhou Junshang

Education, the lifeline of the nation and the foundation of national culture, is in complete turmoil today. Universities are even more turbulent, dazzling us! Expelling presidents and going on strike, demanding salary increases and stopping teaching, petitioning for relocation, petitioning for cutting departments, petitioning for increased food allowances, opposing comprehensive exams, opposing entrance exams, opposing unfair treatment, opposing the cancellation of public funding, opposing changes to the education system, opposing the GPA system – one thing after another, one scene after another, endlessly unfolding a continuous drama. But how can the nation and the people bear these evil consequences!

Student unrest, though jarring, is not necessarily a bad phenomenon and may sometimes reflect a sense of justice, responsibility, a thirst for knowledge, and even a desire for survival. Even if students are being manipulated, there must first be an opportunity for manipulation. This "opportunity" is the origin of the "problem." Why do we allow others to have an "opportunity" to "exploit?" This is something we should reflect on and repent! Young students have a sense of right and wrong and very few conflicts of interest. Their mistakes are really nothing more than "mistakes." Ultimately, there are not many who intentionally commit mistakes or crimes. This is not to say that the unrest is justified, but rather to recognize the nature of the unrest and quickly address the facts. Look at the private universities before you, and look at the universities in England and America further afield. Know that "the devil finds work for idle hands."

The problem of unrest in universities contains four major causes: political, economic, social, and educational. They are closely related and interconnected.

The withdrawal of political parties from schools is just empty talk! We see so-called "anti-American demonstrations" by university students, student union elections, etc. Although there is no disturbance, the underlying currents of struggle are like mercury seeping into the ground, infiltrating everywhere. The most painful and dangerous thing is using factionalism to pursue selfish interests. The corrupt practices of political struggle have infiltrated into sacred education.

The economic impact is even more real. Education has adopted a policy of starvation, and the allocation of education in senior and junior high school is unfair. First, the salaries of professors are lower than those of junior clerks in state-owned institutions. This is not only a matter of unfairness, but the inability to survive is more tragic than unfairness. The lives of entire families are struggling on the brink of starvation, in a state of life-and-death uncertainty. Teachers' own children are being deprived of education, and there is no money for coffins after death. This has exceeded the poverty of Zhou Lianxi and Zhang Hengqu! Society is also satirizing and even looking down on professors. Life has worn them down to the point where they have no choice but to resort to the weapon of strikes. Secondly, due to economic constraints, school facilities are shabby and unacceptable. In the largest and most prestigious universities, students are more crowded entering the library than riding a bus, waiting in long lines, wasting time and energy, which is truly regrettable! As for the poverty of the students, they worry about food and clothing every day. Some students in the interior have almost crossed the line of "one scoop of water" and "a bamboo basket of rice." This is a hardship that goes against physiological and psychological health!

In today's world, it is almost like "the people are restless, the country is shaking, farmers put down their plows, female workers leave their looms, and the hearts of the people are unsettled." Society is chaotic and turbulent, the hearts of the people are falling into depravity, filled with a greedy, violent, and tyrannical atmosphere. It seems that there is no place for morality. The experiences of gentlemen and petty men are just as the ancients said, "Those who follow the law and adhere to righteousness are insulted by the world, while those who are extravagant and deviant are glorified!" What a terrible reaction will be caused by such reverse elimination being seen and heard by young students? When a person feels depressed, action is the best remedy. Therefore, young people, except for a few who are depressed, mostly commit profit-seeking and risk-taking. Also, because of the economic downturn, graduation means unemployment. They have no choice but to use various methods to prepare for life after graduation. Filled with this psychological background, they naturally have no choice but to abandon their legitimate goals and unintentionally implement the designs of others.

The causes of turbulence in education should be discussed from two aspects: one is educational administration, and the other is the school itself. Selecting a university president for the sons and daughters of the nation is a very serious matter, and being a university president of a country is a very grand matter. How can it be treated as child's play? And how can a president not be on campus for much of the year? The martyr Yingshi was born in Wuxing and died for the country in Shanghai, but Yingshi University insists on staying in Jinhua. Setting that aside, it is difficult to hire good professors, facilities are empty, cultural food is lacking, and there is no leader. That is what students are anxious about! Why is Jiaotong University, which has history, reputation, and achievements, being reorganized by merging and cutting departments, tearing it into pieces? If there were no unrest, who would dare to say that this news is all lies? In times of war and chaos, various schools have only just barely breathed a sigh of relief after returning to their campuses. For several years, classes have been intermittent, holding onto the old and incomplete. Those students are truly a confused and at a loss, a group that is anxious and tired, a group that is dark and empty. Suddenly, they are asked to take comprehensive exams and entrance exams, like a bolt from the blue. The purpose of comprehensive exams and entrance exams is nothing more than to improve standards, but being corrupt in peacetime and strict in the moment is not only focusing on the superficial and neglecting the fundamental, but also like punishing without teaching. Poor people have bad tempers and are prone to revolt. Medicine and pharmacy are different. In today's difficult times, the length of medical education should be shortened. Why extend pharmaceutical studies? These are all blunders that cause unnecessary trouble! Under this kind of educational administration, only factors of unrest are created, and nothing can be avoided. How can we calm student unrest in this way, which is like carrying firewood to put out a fire?

The turbulence caused by the schools themselves is indeed closely related to educational administration. For example, there are no clear standards for hiring presidents, and some who engage in corruption and fraud enter the sacred halls of learning. Economic matters are not made public, which is bound to cause problems. Forcing someone who cannot distinguish between "Annan" and "Vietnam" to be the president of a specialized school will naturally lead to unrest again. Poor school administrative systems easily lead to presidential dictatorship or bureaucratization; everything is concentrated in one person, and all power is concentrated in one person. The school's success or failure depends solely on the president. Once the president has a problem, the entire school collapses. Moral education is concentrated on a single "fear," and the responsibilities of departments and individual professors are pushed away completely. There are few opportunities for contact between teachers and students, their feelings for each other are weak, and the transformation of character becomes just empty talk. Since the abolition of the mentor system, things have only gotten worse. There are many compulsory courses, which are rigid, and there is no research work. Any achievements are often cut short. After fighting for eight years, we still do not clearly understand what others have invented. Talents are not concentrated, and everything is empty in universities in the interior, with no equipment, no medicine, newspapers are difficult to obtain, and professors are unwilling to go. University entrance exams are too difficult, but the coursework after entering is too easy. Time is wasted, and there are no opportunities for exercise. Students have to find other outlets. Isn't there an external cause of disturbance? Like water flowing downwards, it is unstoppable once it starts.

Building a new China cannot be based on educational turbulence, especially university turbulence. China's science is backward, and there is a shortage of talent. University education is more important than in any other country. This turbulent situation must not be allowed to continue. The way to save the situation is nothing more than "fairness" and "sincerity," and strengthening the personnel system is particularly urgent. Standards for university presidents should be stipulated, and senior figures in the academic community should be enlisted by the National Government to form a committee for the selection and appointment of presidents to determine the candidates for president. University presidents must be the top talents in the country, not only able to lead academically, but also have moral character that can serve as a model for the people. Professors should be selected and appointed by a committee organized by the president, deans, and professor representatives, making it difficult for professors to enter the school and difficult to leave. Moral education should be placed on the departments and faculties, with everyone responsible. Professors' salaries must be above those of ordinary people, and at least be able to survive today, and then achieve what Xunzi advocated: "...live by this, die by this."

Education itself must be sound, and then we can urge the government to implement it as soon as possible. Chairman Chiang's "Education First" policy, as stipulated in the Constitution, should increase the budget. Not only should the government go all out for education, but the entire society, every private individual, should contribute money and effort at all times and in all places to do their part for the nation's century-long plan. Education itself is politics, and to ask education to leave politics is no different from asking students to leave school. However, for the sake of the country, all parties should return freedom to education. There should be freedom of learning, freedom of research, and freedom of criticism in universities, so that academic culture can blossom and bear fruit in the democratic fertile soil that everyone supports together.

### Bevin Clarifies Current Foreign Policy - Britain Concerned with Interests in the Far East - Hopes Treaty of Peace with Japan Can Be Concluded Soon - Pays Particular Attention to Restoring Trade Relations with China

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] The British House of Commons met today to discuss foreign policy, with most of the discussion focusing on the Far East issue, and the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Far East.

Labor MP Davis stated that if the United States and Britain joined forces to wage war against the Soviet Union, the world would surely not believe that the Soviet Union would have no friends. It should be known that the countries of the Far East would rally to support the Soviet Union in leading the colonial people and "yellow people" who were unwilling to take the same line as the British Empire. I believe that the United States should have required all countries to cooperate in reorganizing Japan, but the United States has not done so, causing black markets and disorder in Japan.

Clayton, also a Labor MP Williams, who recently led an investigation committee that completed its inspection in Burma and returned home, also delivered a speech, stating that he believed that the United States' intervention in China over the past decade had caused an unfortunate impact on the lives of the people of that country. The Chinese people, especially democrats, are tired of American intervention, and this will give us a great opportunity. Regarding the issue of the return of property stolen by Japan to its original owners, I believe that the actions of the United States are rather like "receiving stolen goods privately." These properties were moved to Japan by the Japanese, and the original owners have not yet received compensation. We know that these properties have been moved to the United States. Whether from the perspective of international law or common sense, the United States has no right to do this. Conservative MP Fletcher stated that the Far East issue needs to be resolved urgently, and the United States' ability in Japan is worthy of attention. Labor MP Barden stated that if the new political organization in Japan is controlled by left-wing forces, it will surely be able to exist. It is doubtful whether the abolition of the divinity of the Japanese Emperor will have a lasting effect. I believe that Britain should have a say in the development of Japan's cotton textile exports.

At this point, Foreign Secretary Bevin stood up and replied that it was a misunderstanding to say that the British government was not fully concerned about the Far East. On the contrary, we have already established a liaison committee in Japan, and Prime Minister Attlee has also appointed a personal representative to be stationed in Japan. We also have envoys stationed throughout China, and we are paying close attention to the situation in China. The British government has already requested the Chinese government to consult with the United States to discuss the trade relations between China and Britain, and China's counter-proposal has also been sent to our country. The British government urgently wants to examine the labor situation in China, so it has appointed a labor counselor to be stationed permanently at the British Embassy in China. As for the Japan issue, the British government has also appointed a labor counselor. Regarding the Korean issue, the US-Soviet Joint Commission is scheduled to begin consultations on May 20, with the aim of establishing a provisional government and a four-power trusteeship system in Korea. Regarding the Sudan issue, we have never attempted to adopt a policy of appeasement towards Egypt at the expense of the Sudanese people. I have proposed a peaceful solution, but I have never attempted to buy a peaceful solution. In short, I still hope that the current differences in views can be resolved internationally. We will eventually be able to resolve these differences of opinion, but if we cannot achieve a resolution, the government authorities will have to re-examine its entire policy. The greatest obstacle we must overcome in making peace is that we should not think that Britain is no longer a strong country, or that Britain no longer occupies an important position in the world. In fact, Britain is one of the important countries for world peace. I hope that a treaty of peace with Japan can be concluded soon, which is possible. The first step is to form an Allied agreement based on this treaty. The government authorities will do their best to achieve this goal. We will maintain close contact with the governments of the various autonomous territories, as Australia and Canada are particularly concerned about the treaty of peace with Japan.

Regarding the China issue

[Central News Agency, London, 16th] The following is an excerpt from Foreign Secretary Bevin's remarks regarding the China issue: Bevin stated that the British government had also made the same negotiation proposal to the Chinese government at the same time as it was in contact with the US government regarding the conclusion of a commercial treaty, but the Chinese government has extended the negotiations until after it resolves the issue with the United States. China's counter-proposal has now been received and is being intensively studied by the relevant departments of the British government. Bevin further stated that as for the issue of Britain's former public concession interests in China, the Chinese government is responsible for handling it in accordance with the 1943 treaty, and a liquidation committee has been established to determine the debts of the Chinese side. There has been some progress in this matter. But I admit that progress has been very slow, and I hope that this matter will be completed more quickly. I myself am paying close attention to this important issue. Bevin also stated that former employees of the Shanghai Public Concession will receive no less than 40 pounds per month from the British government. We must ask the Chinese government to resolve this matter in the final adjustment. (Central News Agency note: When the British government proposed the request to negotiate a commercial treaty, our government had already received the US draft and began negotiations. As for the draft of the Sino-British commercial treaty prepared by our side, it was submitted to the British side at the end of last year, but no opinion has been received from the British side on this draft to date.)

### Churchill Again Criticizes - British Labor Government

Condemns it as Heading Down a Path of Self-Destruction

[Reuters, Ayr, 16th] Churchill, while receiving the freedom of the city here, again criticized the Labor government, condemning it as heading down a path of self-destruction. He said that there is not a single place in the world where British affairs have not been handled improperly, and Britain's strength and reputation are sadly declining. Maintaining a force of 100,000 British troops in Palestine is the most pointless and foolish act. No country in the world has destroyed itself like Britain.

[United Press, Ayr, Scotland, 16th] Churchill tonight delivered a political speech to 6,000 people here, sharply questioning whether the Labor government intended to apply for another loan from the United States to resolve Britain's political and economic difficulties. It is said that little remains of Britain's previous loan, which has all been wasted on various unnecessary projects, which is unwise. A large military force should be maintained, but the costly garrison in Palestine is unnecessary.

### Change of Hong Kong Governor - Yang Muqi Retires and Returns to England

New Governor Maitland Sneddon Scheduled to Take Office Next Month

[United Press, Hong Kong, 17th] Sir Mark Young, the retiring Governor of Hong Kong, left for England on the British ship "Stradnago" on the 17th with his family. The post of Governor of Hong Kong is temporarily being filled by Colonial Secretary McDougall. The new Governor of Hong Kong, Maitland Sneddon, will come to Hong Kong in June. According to reports, Yang Muqi took office as Governor of Hong Kong in October 1941. Before three months had passed, the Pacific War broke out. After the fall of Hong Kong on Christmas Day in December 1941, Yang was captured and detained in concentration camps in Taiwan and Shenyang with the "Hero of Bataan," US General Wainwright, and other senior officials of the Allied countries. After the victory, Yang returned home and took office as Governor of Hong Kong again in May 1946.

### Wavell Promoted to Earl

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Marshal Wavell has been promoted to Earl, known as Earl Wavell.

### Bevin Leaves London - Preparing to Attend Labor Party Congress

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin left here today for Folkestone on the coast of the English Channel, where he will stay until the 29th of this month. During this time, he will attend the Labor Party Congress held in Margate on the 27th of this month. Doctors have advised Bevin to pay close attention to his health.

### Soviet Delegation - May Arrive in Seoul Today

[United Press, Murchison, 17th] The US military command announced today that the Soviet delegation and secretariat of 75 people from North Korea will arrive here tomorrow to reopen negotiations on the issue of organizing a provisional government for the entire Korean peninsula.

[United Press, San Francisco, 16th] Secretary of Commerce Harriman recently stated at the Federal Club here that Korea needs our help. After we liberated Korea and freed it from Japan's yoke, the Koreans still cannot establish their independent lives without our help.

### US Fleet Visits Australia

[Agence France-Presse, Sydney, Australia, 17th] The US Navy's 38th Fleet sailed into here this morning, consisting of ten warships, including an aircraft carrier. The purpose of their visit is to allow young American sailors to visit the war sites of the Pacific.

### Rumor Mountbatten Will Suggest - Britain Withdraw Early from India - India Adopts Stern Measures to Maintain Order

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] The Daily Mail reported that if the talks do not reach an agreement with the Indian leaders on the transfer mechanism regarding the handover of power in India, Governor-General Mountbatten will advocate implementing the handover earlier than the originally scheduled date of June 1948. Judging from the statement issued by Governor-General Mountbatten's advisor, Lord Ismay, that the Indian administrative work is on the verge of collapse, it has become clear that Mountbatten's efforts to unite the Indian leaders have failed. Therefore, the cabinet has cabled Mountbatten to return home for a final consultation next week. It is reported that a transfer mechanism will be set up to prevent India from falling into civil war.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 16th] A responsible person here recently stated that, in view of the increasingly tense situation and the deep fear that the declaration of India's political status will cause religious conflicts to re-emerge, the Indian authorities are taking stern measures to maintain order throughout the country. Once unrest occurs, all troops will be mobilized immediately.

### Security Council Discusses Greek Issue; US and Soviet Representatives Clash; Balkan Investigation Committee Divided

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations Security Council convened today at the written request of the Soviet Union to discuss the Greek issue. Representatives of various countries engaged in heated debate. When the Yugoslav representative was presenting his views, the US representative, Johnson, suddenly interrupted, requesting the chair to ask the Yugoslav representative to limit the scope of his remarks to the issue under discussion, and not to make lengthy attacks on Greece. The Soviet representative then intervened, asking the chair to request the US representative not to interrupt the Yugoslav representative's speech. The Belgian representative, Langehove, supported the establishment of an auxiliary committee by the Balkan Fact-Finding Committee, stating that the Fact-Finding Committee has the power to appoint an auxiliary committee, but prior approval from the Security Council is required. Although this is a simple matter, it is important because it will set a precedent in the Security Council, and he hoped that the Security Council would carefully consider this issue. The Yugoslav representative protested against the Fact-Finding Committee's decision to appoint an auxiliary committee, stating that the Fact-Finding Committee had exceeded its authority in making this decision. The validity of the Fact-Finding Committee's report is also questionable because it includes the accusations of the Greek government without considering the other side of the issue. Finally, Gromyko requested the Security Council to re-examine the entire Greek issue, and the meeting was then adjourned.

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 16th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that the work of the United Nations Balkan Fact-Finding Committee may not be concluded soon. The representatives have had extremely divergent opinions, and therefore have been unable to draft a joint report. It is possible that each person will draft an individual conclusion.

### Pacific Earthquake

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Broadcast: The US Geological Research Institute stated that two severe earthquakes occurred in the Solomon Islands at 3:00 AM this morning. The extent of the damage is expected to be very severe.

### US House Committee to Discuss Next Year's Naval Budget; 11% Cut from Truman's Original Proposal

[United Press, Washington, 16th] The House Appropriations Committee today submitted the amendment to the naval budget for the next fiscal year to the House for discussion next week. The total amount is $3,135,481,000, a reduction of 11% from President Truman's original proposal, which is more than $377 million, and a reduction of $1,197 million from this year's budget. After the budget cuts, the strength of the Navy and Marine Corps may be reduced by 40,000 personnel, hundreds of employees will be laid off, and some coastal facilities will be closed. However, the budget will fully allocate funds for naval research and the reserve forces, without any cuts.

  Naval Commanders Request More Funding

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The US House Appropriations Committee is currently studying the naval appropriations bill for 1948. Various naval commanders participated, requesting more funding. The opinions stated by the commanders are as follows: A senior intelligence officer of the US Navy stated that the international situation is "darker than we expected," and he urged the strengthening of intelligence work. Rear Admiral Inglis stated that the Navy Department has once again prepared to immediately restore wartime naval intelligence networks in the event of another emergency. The international situation has prompted an increase in intelligence work, not a decrease. Currently, naval intelligence work is adapting to the development of atomic energy, the popularization of spray planes, and the use of rocket artillery. At the same time, the Navy Department submitted a report to the subcommittee that had been released to the public, stating that, according to naval intelligence, the Soviet Union has taken 10,000 to 20,000 scientists and technicians from Germany to work in Soviet factories. Rear Admiral Lee, Director of Naval Research, stated that the Soviet Union is extremely interested in military research. The Soviet Union's budget for scientific research in 1946 accounted for 943 million rubles, and in 1947 it accounted for 1.226 billion rubles. The Soviet Union's budget and its policies are of a secret nature, and various military research projects may be disguised as other expenses such as educational expenses. At the same time, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal stated that the future "electronic" war is not yet being discussed. The Bikini atomic bomb test has proven that fleets at sea are not victims of atomic bombs. Forrestal also stated that the demobilization plan for the Navy and Marine Corps last year has reduced naval officers and soldiers from 4 million to the current 600,000.

### US and Yugoslavia to Settle Lend-Lease Accounts

[United Press, Washington, 16th] The State Department announced today that Yugoslavia has agreed to begin talks with the United States on the 19th to settle the $32 million in military lend-lease accounts. Efforts will also be made to reach an understanding on US-frozen Yugoslav assets and Yugoslav-frozen US assets.

[US Information Service, Washington, 16th] A State Department spokesman stated today that the Soviet delegation and the US Lend-Lease group are currently conducting discussions, but details are not yet available. The spokesman continued, "Lend-Lease discussions with China will be held in the 'near future'," but the date is not yet determined. With the exception of the Soviet Union and China, the settlement of Lend-Lease issues with other major powers has been completed.

### Communist Elements Active in Hollywood Film Studios; "Purge" Inevitable

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Broadcast: After investigating Hollywood for a week, the US House Un-American Activities Subcommittee returned to Washington today. The committee believes that Communist elements are very active in the film studios and advocates for an immediate purge. Congressman Thomas urged film studio executives to carry out the "purge" themselves, without Congress having to "do it for them."

### US Warship to Visit Persian Gulf

Iranian People Quite Shocked

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 16th] News of a US destroyer visiting the Persian Gulf has reached here, and well-informed sources are shocked, saying that it is clear evidence that the United States attaches importance to Iran. Local newspapers only published the communiqué issued by the US Embassy and did not comment on it. Observers say that there are two things that make local public opinion uneasy: (1) Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sadchikov, will soon return to his country to report on his work; (2) US advisor to the Iranian Gendarmerie, Schowalterkov, will also return to his country to purchase equipment needed by the Iranian Gendarmerie.

### German Trade Negotiations

### US Department of Agriculture Releases World Grain Situation

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Broadcast: The US Department of Agriculture recently released the world food supply situation, stating that although the grain supply may be better in the coming year than this year, it is still extremely scarce. In Asia, the rice shortage will become even more serious.

### Siamese Tin Ingots Shipped to the US

### US Foreign Relief Plan: Joint Committee of Both Houses Reaches Agreement; Original Amount of $350 Million Maintained

[US Information Service, Washington, 16th] The case of President Truman's request for an appropriation of $350 million for foreign relief after the conclusion of the UN Relief Work has been agreed to by a joint committee of both houses of Congress today. According to this item, the relief fund will be allocated to six countries and the Free City of Trieste. The amount had been reduced to $200 million during the House's discussion, but the Senate insisted on allocating the full amount, which led to the convening of the joint committee. After Senate Speaker Vandenberg strongly urged for the full amount to be allocated, the committee made this decision, but the case still needs to be approved by both houses of Congress before it can be formally implemented, with the House acting first and the Senate following. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said: He may submit the case on Wednesday. The plan after the agreement between the two houses stipulates that the scope of application of this relief fund is limited to the following countries: Austria, Hungary, Greece, Poland, Italy, China, and the Free City of Trieste. However, $15 million can be reserved from the total amount, so that the President can use it for relief to other countries if necessary. In addition, the case also specifies that before the full amount is paid, a relief fund of $75 million can be borrowed from the US Reconstruction Bank. The Senate relented to the amendment proposed by the House to allocate more than $40 million to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, and an agreement was also reached.

### Situation in Vietnam Enters New Phase; Political Solution Expected

[Central News Agency, Saigon, 17th] Unofficial sources say: The general situation in Vietnam will take a sharp turn for the better, and the restoration of peace is not unexpected. French Defense Minister Coste-Floret declared: The war in Vietnam will come to an end, the French army has completed its work, and the future will be a political issue. French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Bollaert, is currently in Hanoi. He will explain France's hopes for the future of Vietnam this afternoon. Most people believe that Bollaert can transform military affairs into political affairs. If so, Bollaert will debate with the major Vietnamese parties (including the Viet Minh) to restore peace in Vietnam. Another senior French official, Mr. Mieu, is currently in Tokyo. He is familiar with the situation in Vietnam, and his mission in Tokyo is to find a way to restore peace with Vietnam. Mr. Mieu has met with several confidants of Ho Chi Minh's government in Hanoi and Haiphong. Currently, the seven major right-wing parties in Vietnam have formed an alliance in Hong Kong. King Bao Dai of Annam is the director of the alliance. He advocates that Tokyo, Annam, and Cochinchina must be unified, and Vietnam must have its own autonomous government. French Vietnam is united under the French Federation. Observers believe that if the French government agrees, Bao Dai will form a government to replace Ho Chi Minh's government.

### Difficulties in Forming New Italian Cabinet

Communists Oppose Being Excluded from the Cabinet

[Associated Press, Rome, 16th] After being ordered to form a cabinet, Italian Socialist Party leader Nitti today began to implement the organization of a "national concentration" cabinet, attempting to recruit seven or eight political parties and two political elders into the cabinet to save Italy from its current economic crisis. It is heard that Orlando, 87, and Bonomi, 73, have agreed to cooperate.

[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] The Italian Communist Party today rejected Nitti's attempt to exclude the Communist Party from the cabinet. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti said that the Italian Communist Party must remain in any new cabinet. He said that if the Communist Party's political views and plans can be respected, the Communist Party will not oppose Nitti's formation of a cabinet. Nitti and Togliatti's views on economic issues are very different, so the chances of forming a cabinet together are very slim.

### Jewish Underground Activities; Two British Soldiers Missing

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast: Since several Jewish underground operatives were executed, British soldiers in Palestine have been missing. Today, 100,000 British soldiers in Jerusalem received a notification from the wireless radio that two British soldiers were missing, and it is feared that they have been kidnapped by underground operatives.

### Molotov Cocktail Thrown at Soviet Embassy in Finland

[Associated Press, Helsinki, 16th] Yesterday, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the Soviet Embassy here, causing significant damage to the furniture inside.

It is rumored that three suspects and several students have been detained and are being interrogated.

### De Gaulle Refuses to Participate in European Union Movement

[Associated Press, London, 16th] According to reliable sources close to Churchill, French President De Gaulle has refused to participate in Churchill's plan to create a European Union.

### Tetsu Katayama to Become Prime Minister; Liberal Party Agrees

[International News Service, Tokyo, 17th] Liberal Party Secretary-General Ono went to the Prime Minister's official residence on the 17th after the party's executive meeting to meet with the Cabinet Secretary of the Hayashi Cabinet, and reported the results of the executive meeting. He then resigned and told reporters: Today, the Liberal Party's executive meeting unanimously agreed to support the Socialist Party to become Prime Minister, and intends to seek the general consent of the party at the general meeting of members on the 18th. However, this does not mean that the work of forming a cabinet has been completed, because the issue of cabinet member allocation has not yet been resolved. This point may require another meeting of the secretaries-general of the four parties on the evening of the 18th to discuss. As for whether President Yoshida will still take on the news position, it will depend on his own intentions.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] State Minister Shidehara issued a statement on the political situation, saying: "The method of resolving the political situation should follow the decision of the previous four-party talks, and promote the principle of establishing a united government as much as possible. As for the Prime Minister's issue, although the Socialist Party is the first party, it still cannot control the majority in the Diet." The subtext clearly indicates that he has not yet agreed to Katayama's appointment as Prime Minister.

### Three Cabinet Members of Yoshida Cabinet Officially Announced to be Purged

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The Central Public Office Qualification Examination Committee announced: Minister of Finance Ishibashi and Minister of Commerce Ishii should be purged. Minister of Justice Kimura and member of parliament Mawatari Samin, elected from Toyama Prefecture, should also be purged. After the purge of Ishibashi, Ishii, and Mawatari, the number of seats of the Liberal Party has been reduced to 128. Although the resignations of all cabinet members of the Yoshida Cabinet have been submitted, a decision will be made on the 20th. Now that Ishibashi and the other three ministers have been purged, it has been decided to submit them first. It is rumored that the reason for the purge of Ishibashi and Ishii is that they were the president of the Toyo Keizai Shinpo and the editorial committee member of the Korea Shimbun.

### Original Informants Sentenced to Prison; Sun Tianchang Declared Not Guilty; Presiding Judge of Military Tribunal Explains Reasons for Judgment; Believes That Even if the Accusations are True, They Do Not Constitute a Crime

[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Korean Sun Tianchang, suspected of being a war criminal, was declared not guilty by the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal yesterday afternoon.

Sun Tianchang, with a background in mechanical technology, established the Precision Crafts Company in Shanghai before the war, manufacturing industrial machines such as lathes and milling machines. After the enemy army occupied Shanghai in 1944, he was designated by the enemy army as a Class B military factory, ordering him to manufacture military equipment. It was confiscated by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau after the victory. In August of last year, citizens Zhou Ganfu and others secretly reported to the Investigation Team that Sun Tianchang was a pro-enemy arms dealer who had donated aircraft to the enemy and contracted to repair the machines in the Jinling Arsenal, and had also used the Moudeli Music Store's main factory, seized by the Japanese army, to purchase coins for the enemy and manufacture military fire. In the later period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he also erected anti-aircraft guns on the roof. After receiving the secret report, the Investigation Team transferred the case to the High Court for trial. When the charge of being a traitor to Australia was not established, it was transferred to the Military Tribunal and prosecuted for suspected war crimes.

After Presiding Judge Li Liangting read out the main text of the "Sun Tianchang Not Guilty" verdict yesterday, he explained the reasons, stating briefly: The prosecution of this case is based on Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, namely, "Supporting the War of Aggression Against the Republic of China." This court believes that when trying whether the defendant has committed this crime, it must

Sun Tianchang (Photo by this Newspaper)

consider two points:

(1) What is supporting a war of aggression? (2) Whether it is intentional support? The so-called support for a war of aggression refers to the behavior that can expand or prolong the war of aggression, which can be said to be support. The various crimes accused in the indictment, in addition to some evidence being insufficient, and some being rebutted by the defendant, can be considered as facts. It may have helped the war of aggression, but it would not have had this impact if it were said to be able to expand or prolong the war of aggression. For example, the erection of anti-aircraft guns has nothing to do with the war of aggression. As for using the Moudeli Music Store to manufacture military fire for the enemy and contracting to repair the Jinling Arsenal, it was found that the defendant's factory was

Managed by the Japanese

and soldiers were sent to monitor it. Therefore, even if it is indeed manufacturing military fire, whether the defendant did it intentionally is still a question. As for the points of purchasing raw materials and purchasing coins, the witnesses failed to provide concrete evidence, and the defendant's accounts were seized by the Third Front Army. If there were such records in them, the Third Front Army should be able to provide them to this court as evidence, but the Third Front Army did not provide them. Regarding the donation of aircraft, the defendant admitted that he had donated 400,000 yuan, but provided evidence that he was forced to donate in the name of national defense donations, and it was not intentional. Moreover, even if this fact exists, it has no important impact on the war of aggression. Furthermore, in terms of criminal law, the defendant had Japanese nationality before the victory of the war, and this kind of behavior cannot constitute a crime. Based on the above points, the verdict of not guilty is given.

Sun Tianchang

was overjoyed when he left the court after hearing the verdict and smiled openly. His relatives and friends, and defense lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yang Linzhi, all stepped forward to congratulate him. After the verdict is made in this case, it still needs to be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for approval, and Sun Tianchang will still be released on the original bail. It is reported that the two original informants in the Sun Tianchang case, Hu Chenggen and Xu Tianxi, were also reported to be traitors and were sentenced to imprisonment as early as January 13. Hu was sentenced to four years and Xu to three years.

Today's closing ceremony is held on the Xing'an Wheel, which is not without meaning, because what everyone is always thinking about is the revival of the national fortune, especially the revival of the shipping industry. To achieve this goal, we must gather our collective wisdom and unite together. Therefore, I specially made a couplet: "United into a Great Cause; Shipping Industry Rejoices in Revival" to commemorate this grand event. Speaking of the revival of the national fortune, we must first pay the highest respect to President Chiang's wise and outstanding leadership, especially for the maintenance of the shipping industry. Executive Yuan President Zhang Yuejun, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Chief of the General Staff Chen Cixiu, Minister of Organization Chen Lifu, and Chief of the Transportation Department of the Combined Logistics Headquarters Xi Yichang have all given great help and encouragement to the shipping industry, enabling us to move forward on the road to revival. Therefore, the General Assembly unanimously decided to send a respectful telegram to the officials and present flags at the closing ceremony. The union of the national shipping industry has just begun, and it is deeply believed that it will achieve unlimited success.

Commander Xuan of the Garrison Department arrived at this time and also stood up to give a speech as an official, suggesting two points: (1) Those who value the shipping industry should not seek the development of their own businesses, but concentrate their efforts to jointly develop the entire national shipping industry; (2) Concentrate funds to find ways to build ships themselves, as a century-long plan for the future of the entire national shipping industry. After the speech, nine banners were presented by Du Yuesheng and others, and accepted by Director Lu Jingshi and Director Li Bohou on behalf of the officials. Finally, a respectful telegram was sent to the chairman to pay tribute and a telegram was sent to Supreme Commander MacArthur of the Allied Forces, earnestly and urgently requesting to compensate China with 500,000 tons of Japan's remaining merchant ships, and to strictly limit Japan's subsequent merchant ship tonnage and its scope of activities, to prevent it from threatening world peace again.

### Robbery Late at Night on Chongqing Road: All Arrested in Three Hours

Last night at 10 o'clock, two robbers suddenly arrived, one dressed in a black Zhongshan suit and the other in a black top and yellow trousers.

Neighbors heard the shouts and rushed over, capturing the robber. At the same time, the security guard had already rushed to report to the Xincheng Police Branch. Zhuo, the head of the branch, summoned all the police officers.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The methods for police and Baojia liaison for eradicating opium addiction in Shanghai have been determined through discussions convened by the Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression of the Ministry of Interior, the Civil Affairs Office, the Health Bureau, and the Police Bureau, and have been approved by the Municipal Council. The content stipulates that Baojia heads must pay close attention and investigate at all times. If they discover cases of smuggling, manufacturing, selling, storing, or consuming opium, they must immediately report them to the district office, which will handle them jointly with the police branch. If the offender is caught in the act and there is a risk of escape or destruction of evidence, they may directly report it to the police branch for prompt arrest. The police station and district Baojia must strictly keep confidential the cases reported by Baojia heads and the public and must not announce the names of the informants. Each police branch must quickly investigate the cases reported by Baojia heads according to the address. If necessary, the original informant must also assist in the handling and must be handled with caution. They must not be released on the grounds of insufficient evidence or minor offenses, and those who violate this will be investigated. Each police branch must notify the local Jia heads to assist in handling opium cases, regardless of who the informant is, and must create a detailed roster and report the handling situation, sending them to the district office for forwarding to the Civil Affairs Office and announcing them to the public in the Bao office. The distribution and handling of rewards for the seizure of drugs will be handled in accordance with the regulations.

The adjustment of the wages of workers and the salaries of staff members in the city this month has been decided by the Price Meeting of the Economic Committee and the Municipal Council.

(3) The cost of living index for staff members will be compiled and announced by the municipal government as before. Whether the salaries of staff members in various companies and factories should be discounted and calculated can be handled according to past practice. Those who have calculated wages based on the cost of living index for workers in the past will also be allowed to follow past practice.

### Despite the Huge Deficit in the Municipal Finance, It Is Decided Not to Open Up New Taxes and Strive for Subsidies for the Shortfall

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the adjustment of the salaries of civil servants, the municipal government's expenditure for this year has increased by 9.2 billion yuan. The Municipal Council has decided to request subsidies from the central government by telegram. Due to the recent surge in prices, various bureaus have requested additional budgets, which greatly exceed the original budget. Finance Bureau Director Tian Yongqian told reporters yesterday that tax revenue is currently in a strong month, so it can still be maintained. However, if another month or two passes and it enters a slow month, revenue and expenditure will be unable to balance. There is a huge shortfall in fiscal revenue and expenditure this year. In addition to working hard to rectify tax revenue, it has been decided to strive for subsidies from the central government for the shortfall. At a time when the people are poor and resources are exhausted, there are currently no plans to open up new taxes or adjust tax rates. Director Tian also said that there are no arbitrary taxes in the city. All taxes levied by the Finance Bureau are in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations. The central government originally allowed local governments to open up three special taxes, but the city currently only has the municipal construction donation and the hotel tax. The third type could still be opened up, but the authorities currently have no intention of doing so.

### Speaker Inspects District Administration, Pays Attention to Hygiene and Public Works, How Can Sheds Be Built on Garbage Dumps, The Wire Mesh Walls in Zhabei Should Be Demolished

[Our Newspaper's Report] Municipal Councilor Speaker Pan began to personally visit various districts yesterday to understand the local equipment so as to contribute to municipal authorities to seek improvement. Speaker Pan inspected Zhabei and North Railway Station districts in the morning and Hongkou and North Sichuan Road districts in the afternoon. The accompanying persons were Chief Secretary Xiang Changquan, Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei, and representatives from the Health Bureau and Public Works Bureau. The inspection focused on hygiene and public works facilities.

According to the inspection results, the following points are considered to require urgent improvement: (1) Zhejiang Road Bridge is exclusively for motor vehicles, causing rickshaws and tricycles to gather at both ends of the bridge, affecting traffic. It is hoped that rickshaws and tricycles can be opened to traffic. (2) The road surface on North Tibet Road is severely damaged and almost forms a ditch. It is hoped that it will be repaired urgently. (3) The road surface on Anqing Road is also largely dilapidated, and piles of rubble and garbage have accumulated on both sides, which is also sufficient to affect traffic and hygiene. (4) The wire mesh walls in Zhabei are no longer necessary and should be demolished immediately. At the same time, the garbage problem is also extremely serious. (5) The garbage pile behind Zhe Xing Li on Diswe Road is three or four feet high, and there are even棚戶 built on it, which is very inappropriate. (6) The construction of Qingyun Bridge has only reached half, and it is at a standstill. It is hoped that the other half can be completed.

The Speaker is scheduled to inspect the Tilanqiao and Yulin districts in the morning and the Yangpu and Xinshi districts in the afternoon today.

[Another Report] Yesterday, when the Speaker was inspecting the Zhabei district, more than 20 representatives of the棚戶 in the district petitioned him, saying that someone claiming to be a landlord was forcing residents to pay three担 of rice in rent every year. However, after investigation, it was found that they were not the landlord, so they requested that justice be done. The Speaker immediately promised to order the relevant authorities to investigate and handle the matter.

### Summoning Witnesses in the Fubo Case, The Defendant's Lawyer Questions Suspicious Points, Boos Break Out in the Audience, Family Members Become Agitated and Want to Fight the Lawyer When Leaving the Court

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the collision between the Fubo warship and the Haimin passenger ship, which resulted in the sinking of the Fubo warship, the district court opened a court session on the 29th of last month to investigate. On the 12th of this month, Judge Zhong Xianda, who was handling the case, personally went to the Haimin passenger ship to investigate. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Criminal Court No. 2 of the district court summoned the Haimin passenger ship passengers Lin Ruwen, Li Chunling, and Liu Yongnian as witnesses. Lin did not arrive. According to Li Chunling's testimony yesterday, he was traveling from Shantou to Shanghai via Xiamen. On the night of the accident, he had already gone to bed when he suddenly felt a shock. He rushed out of the cabin to investigate and saw a flash of red light, and cries for help immediately arose. He stayed on deck for about an hour and did not see the Haimin passenger ship make any preparations or take any actions to rescue people, so the passengers were angry and scolded without end. Liu Yongnian testified that he came to Shanghai from Xiamen because his child was sick, so he did not sleep late at night. He heard the alarm bell ring twice and felt a shock, so he went up to the deck to investigate and saw that the Fubo warship had sunk by two-thirds. People were floating on the sea surface, but the Haimin passenger ship continued to sail forward. None of the senior officers in the ship came out of the cabin. The passengers discussed it animatedly, and after an hour, they returned to the original location. The defendant Dai Rulin did not propose any motions yesterday. The defense lawyer for the defendant, Wei Wenda, appeared in court on his behalf to listen to the testimony and requested that the court question suspicious points. Because he spoke too much, it aroused the dissatisfaction of the families of the deceased in the audience, and boos broke out. The court ordered the police to stop them. When the questioning was over and the court was adjourned, the audience suddenly became agitated, with continuous cries and wailing. They wanted to fight the defendant's lawyer. The bailiffs did their best to dissuade them, and lawyer Wei Wenda sneaked out of the courtroom through the back door.

In addition, 45 family members of the officers and soldiers who died on the Fubo warship have registered and requested the district court to order the defendant Dai Rulin to compensate them 37 billion, 800 yuan in national currency. 12 more people have now registered, so they have filed a new petition requesting additional compensation of 11 billion, 7,900 yuan in national currency, bringing the total amount to 48 billion, 8,700 yuan in national currency. The reason is that the Haimin passenger ship failed to provide assistance and did not lower the lifeboats to rescue people after the accident. During the previous investigation, the glass on the Haimin passenger ship was not broken, but this time it was found that many glass windows were broken, which was obviously deliberately done afterwards.

### Mees Pierson Appeal Sentence Announced: One Year Imprisonment; Defendant's Ignorance of Our Laws Not Aggravated; Mees Still Dissatisfied, Decides to Appeal to the Supreme Court

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mees Pierson, a Dutchman and manager of the Ebbes Company, was found by the Garrison Headquarters to have secretly traded foreign currency after the promulgation of the economic emergency measures by our government. Mees was detained and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The District Court sentenced Mees to one year of imprisonment. Mees, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the High Court. The prosecutor also appealed, arguing that the original sentence was too lenient. The case was announced yesterday morning at the High Court. US Consul General Anderson, Foreign Minister Frain, legal advisor Zhang Tianyin, Dutch Consul Philip Favis, and the defendant's lawyers Chen Rui and Cai Rudong were all present to hear the verdict. At 9:30 AM, Liu Yugui, the Chief Judge of the High Court's Criminal Division, along with judges Han Shuzhi and Wang Kequan, and Prosecutor Qu Rong, took their seats in the First Criminal Court, and the bailiff brought Mees forward. Chief Judge Liu stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "The original judgment is revoked. Mees Pierson, without government permission, engaged in transactions, receipts, payments, and sales using foreign currency, and is sentenced to one year of imprisonment. US$65,369.71 and HK$20,000 are confiscated." He then announced the reasons for the judgment, stating briefly: "The regulations for punishing the sale and purchase of gold and foreign currency have already been promulgated. According to the law, the new law should be applied for the judgment. Although the prosecutor appealed against the original judgment, considering that the sentence was too lenient, this court believes that the original trial's consideration that the defendant was not familiar with our laws and gave a lighter sentence was still appropriate, so it was not aggravated. If you are not satisfied with this judgment, you can appeal to the Supreme Court within ten days of receiving the judgment." Furthermore, "This court has already ruled to reject the defendant's request for bail. If you are not satisfied, you can also file an appeal to the Supreme Court." It is reported that Mees still expressed dissatisfaction with the High Court's judgment and decided to appeal to the Supreme Court.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] The Resources Committee, in order to encourage technical and management talents for the extension and establishment of heavy industry, has newly formulated a scholarship method for universities. In the past, the committee had used the same method to select and train many outstanding talents, which had been quite effective, but its significance seemed to focus only on education. The new method formulated this time is different from the past, and it aims to enable outstanding students who are about to graduate to actually participate in national heavy industry construction institutions one year before graduation, to feel a practical interest in the departments they will participate in in the future, and to prepare in advance. It is reported that the scholarships will be given to students in the mechanical, electrical, chemical, mining, metallurgy, geology, and civil engineering departments, as well as in the economics, accounting, business administration, and other departments of universities or graduate schools who are in their final year one year before graduation, and the amount of money will be sufficient for one academic year. The committee plans to notify the universities or independent colleges of the scholarship method before the start of the summer vacation, and then verify it based on the school's selection of the records of the outstanding students in the relevant departments. After the scholarship students are approved, they must enter the factories and mines designated by the committee during the summer vacation to practice and receive guidance from the factories and mines where they are located. Their internship performance may be approved by the school authorities as part of their academic performance or graduation thesis data. It is now known that this scholarship method will be established in a number of domestic universities and independent colleges, and negotiations are actively underway.

### A Strong Force in the World Games: Long-Distance Running, Finland Has Abundant Talent, Hanno is the Most Promising Athlete, His 5,000 and 10,000 Meter Results are Amazing

[United Press, Helsinki, Finland, 16th] Although Finland's former famous athletes have faded into obscurity due to war or old age, they will still send a strong team to participate in the 1948 World Games to maintain their past reputation in long-distance running. According to training director, Fan Erside: although new talents inevitably lack experience, there is no need to be pessimistic. Finland's most promising athlete is Hanno, who will participate in the 10,000-meter race and the marathon. Last year, Hanno's 5,000-meter time was 14 minutes and 20.4 seconds, which was Finland's best performance last year. Several people closely followed him, only a few seconds behind. Belaera was 14 minutes and 27 seconds. Since Hanno gave up the 5,000-meter race, he is now Finland's top player. In addition, there are several key players whose results are also not weak. Sakama was 14 minutes and 31.6 seconds, Koskela was 14 minutes and 38 seconds, and Makela's result was within 15 minutes, but he did not participate in the competition last year. Hanno will face many strong opponents in the 10,000 meters, including the veteran Maki and many emerging talents.

The marathon is 26 miles and 385 yards long.

Finland won the marathon championship in 1920 and 1924, but has not won it since, so they are paying special attention to this event, determined to raise the flag again and win.

Provincial Shangzhong has slightly less experience. Forward Yang Cuilian puts in the most effort. Defenders Tu Xiaoxian and Li Fengzhen block left and right, never slackening. The situation was even in the first and third quarters. Chongde dominated in the second and fourth quarters. The score was 21-9 in the first half, and the final score was 40-19.

### Problem of Securities and Futures Commission Changing to Pay in US Dollar Bonds - Transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for Approval - No Normal Transactions Opened in the Market Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the instructions from the Ministry of Finance and Economics that all substitute deposits for margin from securities exchange brokers and substitute deposits for margin for spot trading should be changed to US dollar bonds, the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association were sent to the Securities and Exchange Authority yesterday. After the Securities and Exchange Authority convened a meeting of the Standing Council, it agreed to convey the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association to the Securities and Exchange Supervision Office for transfer to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for approval. Before approval is obtained, the old method will still be followed. The market prices of stocks in the securities market finally opened at the closing prices of the previous day at around 12:00 noon, and continued until 12:30 when the market closed, but there were no transactions. The Brokers Association held a temporary general meeting of all members yesterday afternoon at 2:30 to discuss until the meeting adjourned at around 5:00. The atmosphere at the meeting was hopeful that the market would open as usual tomorrow.

Brokers' Opinions Can Be Summarized Into Two Points

The main opinions formulated by the brokers can be summarized into two points: (1) In order to support the government's implementation of economic policies, they are willing to subscribe for US dollar bonds worth 30 million yuan for the substitute deposits for identity margin in installments. (2) For the substitute deposits for margin for spot trading, it should be requested that, in accordance with the current Securities Exchange Regulations, they should still be allowed to pay and offset with both valuable securities (i.e., the 26 stocks currently listed) and US dollar bonds (according to the face value). The Brokers Association will send these opinions to the Securities and Exchange Authority.

The Exchange Authority Advised to Open the Market as Usual

The Securities and Exchange Authority convened a meeting of the Standing Council at around 9:00 AM yesterday. Du Yue Sheng, Wang Zhishen, Xu Jiguang, Zhuang Shuhao, Yue Jigang, and Zheng Xiaozhou were present. Chairman Du presided over the meeting. Chen Jingmin, Chairman of the Brokers Association, also attended to report the opinions of the brokers. The discussion then began and adjourned at 11:30. It was decided to transfer the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for approval. Before approval is obtained, the old method will still be followed. In addition to formally replying to the Brokers Association, it was also decided that the market would open for trading yesterday morning, and the time would be temporarily extended to 1:30. After the meeting, Du and Wang walked into the market and personally conveyed this decision to the brokers' agents, instructing them to open the market as usual for the time being. At around 12:00, the stock prices of each stock opened at the closing prices of the previous day, and the market closed at 12:30, with no trading volume.

Held a General Meeting in the Afternoon to Discuss the Opening of the Market

At 2:30 PM yesterday, the Brokers Association held a temporary general meeting of all members in the Securities Exchange market rest room. More than 100 members attended. Chairman Chen Jingmin of the Association presided over the meeting. Chen reported on the consultation and efforts made by the Association after receiving the instructions from the Securities and Exchange Authority, and the instructions given by Director Du and General Manager Wang of the Securities and Exchange Authority. The brokers present then had a thorough discussion on the issue of the market opening on Monday, and summarized their opinions: (1) Before the Ministry of Finance and Economics has a definitive answer to the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association, there may be two phenomena when the market opens on Monday: (A) It will still maintain the situation of having prices but no market between 12:00 and 12:30 yesterday, (B) There may be a sharp rise or fall. (2) Before the Ministry of Finance and Economics has a definitive approval, the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association cannot be guaranteed to be realized, and the market should be temporarily suspended. (3) The sharp rise and fall of stock prices in the securities market has already affected the stability of the entire financial and social system. It is hoped that the measures taken by the brokers should be based on social welfare to avoid losing social sympathy. (4) Since the Securities and Exchange Authority has agreed to submit the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association to the Ministry, and will continue to handle the matter according to the old method before the Ministry's instructions arrive, it seems that the Securities and Exchange Authority has also exhausted its human efforts and should open the market as usual. The brokers expressed their opinions one after another, and the meeting did not end until around 5:00.

Supervisory Officer Arrived One Day Late When Receiving the Ministry Order

According to a spokesperson for the Securities and Exchange Authority, the Securities and Exchange Authority received the Ministry's order on the 15th, but the Supervisory Officer of the Ministry of Finance and Economics stationed at the Securities and Exchange Authority only received the Ministry's order on the 16th, so the Brokers Association was only notified yesterday afternoon. He said that this Ministry's order to change the method of paying margin is not as strict as rumored. In fact, if there are difficulties in complying, the government and the Securities and Exchange Authority will never enforce it. Moreover, the solution to all difficulties depends on open discussions between the two parties, and it will not be difficult to solve them. He believes that the situation of the securities market opening yesterday was caused by a misunderstanding, and he believes that the situation will be restored to normal on Monday.

Wang Aotang, the supervisory officer sent by the Ministry of Finance to the Securities and Exchange Authority, also told reporters: The Ministry's order was indeed only received on the 16th. However, because he does not understand the intention and policy of the Ministry's promulgation of this measure, he is not in a position to express any opinions. However, the opinions transferred to the Brokers Association by the Securities and Exchange Authority were submitted to the Ministry of Finance by telegram yesterday afternoon, and under normal circumstances, a reply is expected to arrive within a week.

Fundraising and Sales Committee Declares That This Measure is Not a Forced Contribution

Fan Heyan, Deputy Secretary-General of the US Dollar Bond Fundraising and Sales Committee, made a special statement yesterday regarding the Ministry of Finance and Economics' decision that securities exchange brokers should pay margin with US dollar bonds: The Ministry of Finance and Economics' explicit order was issued after careful consideration, and the method is very appropriate. From the standpoint of bond fundraising and sales, this measure is not a forced contribution. Recalling the stock market turmoil more than 20 years ago, company stocks were used as collateral, which led to serious consequences. Now, in order to stabilize the securities market, using US dollar bonds as substitutes to replace the original stocks is actually safer. US dollar bonds are not affected by the rise and fall of stock prices themselves, and can provide more reliable guarantees. Moreover, the current rise in stock prices seems to have exceeded the price index. However, if the margin is immediately converted into bonds in full, it may stimulate stock prices. He firmly believes that the Securities and Exchange Authority will be able to consider the most appropriate situation and implement the measures smoothly. He suggests that it may be possible to pay in installments.

### Unified Bonds Declined, Foreign Stocks Suspended

Government bonds were initially weak and then recovered yesterday. Unified Bing opened at 14,000 yuan, but retail investors still felt weak, and it fell back to 13,700 yuan. Rooms 560 and 503 and others took advantage of the low price to enter the market, and gradually recovered to 15,600 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. The transaction volume was about 5-6 million. As a result, compared with the previous closing, A and B fell by 900 yuan each, C and D fell by 1,300 yuan, and Unified Wu also fell by 1,000 yuan. Foreign stocks were also affected by Chinese stocks yesterday and announced the suspension of trading.

### National Bank Discount Committee Discussed Loan Applications

[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank Discount Committee Industrial Loan Review Committee held a meeting at around 9:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Zhu Tongjiu. Seventeen cases were discussed, and it is said that most of them can be approved. For some loan applications, the committee reduced the amount based on the Discount Regulations and the actual situation of the loan application. It is said that the amount of loans approved is roughly half of the loan amount.

### Measures for Export Goods Funds - The Four Banks Joint Office Revised and Published - And Revised Measures for Export Bills of Lading for Daily Necessities

In order to dredge the source of goods and encourage exports, the Four Banks Joint Office previously formulated two types of measures: the measures for allowing various bank branches to handle bills of lading loans and the measures for the Central Bank to handle re-pledge and re-endorsement loans for export goods, which were implemented separately. Now that these two measures have been implemented for a long time, some of the regulations are no longer suitable for the current economic situation. Therefore, the National Bank branch has re-formulated the measures for handling export goods loans and the measures for the National Bank branch to assist in the marketing of daily necessities, which are listed as follows:

(1) Measures for Export Goods Loans

(1) Target: Exporters who are directly engaged in exporting goods and have joined the local trade association can apply for handling endorsement, overdraft, and advance payments for the purchase of export goods in the mainland, sorting, lifting, and delivering to the port, or waiting for export at the port, and need to rotate funds.

(2) Deadline: The loan period is limited to the actual period required for purchasing, sorting, packaging, refining, or transporting. It shall be handled by determining the period for each item of endorsement, overdraft, and advance payment. However, the total period before and after shall not exceed 90 days. If a foreign letter of credit has been received but cannot be exported immediately, it can be converted into a short-term packaging loan, and its period shall not exceed 30 days.

(3) Quota: The loan quota is 500 million yuan in national currency or 50 million yuan in circulating currency for each transaction. Each bank branch can do it first and then report it. If it exceeds this quota, it should be submitted to the case for approval before it can be undertaken.

(4) Discount: The discount for collateral is based on the cost of the export goods of the industry, with a maximum of 70% as collateral.

(5) Interest rate: In order to encourage the export of goods, the interest rate of this loan shall not exceed 3.6% per month. In addition to the exchange rate, no other fees shall be charged. However, each bank branch should handle it carefully. If there is a situation where funds are borrowed but not exported, all interest from the date of the loan shall be calculated three times, and the loan shall be recovered immediately, and the qualification for applying for a loan in the future shall be canceled.

(6) Exchange rate: The endorsement exchange rate is calculated according to the exchange rate set by each bank branch in the local area.

(7) Re-pledge: This loan can be re-pledged and re-endorsed to the local National Bank, calculated at 70% of the original loan, and the interest rate is calculated at one-half of the original loan interest rate.

(8) Others: The underwriting bank branch should pay close attention to the foreign market prices of various export goods. If the market price is strong, it should urge exports as much as possible, do more endorsement, and tighten advance payments to regulate.

(9) Implementation: These measures will be implemented after being approved by the Four Banks Joint Office Board of Directors.

(2) Measures for Export Bills of Lading for Daily Necessities

(1) Target: For transportation companies that need to purchase daily necessities and transport them to various places and need rotating funds, they can apply to the local bank branch for handling import and export endorsements. (The scope of daily necessities is in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry of Finance, Cai Gengyi, No. 18288, which are food, cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cotton fabrics, leather, edible salt, edible sugar, edible oil, paper, soap, alkali, matches, medicine, etc.)

(2) Deadline: The endorsement period depends on the transportation situation. All Shanghai endorsements shall not exceed 25 days in Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Yichang, and Shashi, and shall not exceed 30 days in Chongqing and Yingkou (Chongqing may be extended to 45 days during the shallow water season). Other places shall not exceed 20 days.

(3) Quota: The endorsement amount for each transaction is 500 million yuan in national currency or 50 million yuan in circulating currency. Each bank branch can do it first and then report it. If it exceeds this quota, it should be submitted to the case for approval before it can be undertaken.

(4) Discount: The endorsement discount is based on the cost of the collateral, with a maximum of 70% as collateral.

(5) Interest rate: The principle is that it should not exceed 3.6% per month, and in addition to the exchange rate, no other fees shall be charged.

(6) Endorsement: The underwriting bank branch may re-endorse the loan to the local National Bank at 70% of the original loan, and the interest rate is calculated at one-half.

### Weak Demand and Little Trading - Rice Market Stable with a Hint of Weakness - Flour Market Weak and Declining Gradually

Yesterday, the total supply in the North and South markets was about 7,400 dan, but the market was still sluggish, and the situation was stable with a hint of weakness. Middle and lower japonica rice is still in a sluggish state, and middle and lower early rice also had little trading. Indica rice was average, and Bai Yin Yuan was also high and stable but slightly reduced.

Flour is declining gradually. New wheat will be seen in the Shanghai area in two weeks, the Beijing-Shanghai line will be available in three weeks, and Kunshan will also be able to produce new wheat, so the market is weak and continues to fall sharply by 4,000-5,000 yuan. The factories are still open, the actual sales are slightly moving, and the price is temporarily stable. Bean cake was weak in the morning and stable in the afternoon, with no major changes.

The situation in Shantou is mixed, with very little fluctuation. Crude oil rose sharply by 5,000-10,000 yuan due to the acceptance of Guangbang. Bean oil factories can still supply the source, and it fell back by 10,000 yuan. Clear oil also fell by 5,000-6,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil was also weak. Large-cart sesame oil was overstocked, while small-cart sesame oil was scarce and firm.

Mung beans are still dull and lack trading. High-quality soybeans are still stable, while middle and lower qualities are still slightly reduced by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Sesame is not selling well, and short-cut sesame is reduced by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are being handled by Guangdong, and they have risen sharply by 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum stations and bureaus, corn Yutao Island are moving, and they have increased by 1,000-2,000 yuan.

Rice Prices Stabilize

[Reported by this newspaper] Rice prices have stabilized. According to Ji Mingzhai, director of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, there may be a period of stability. During the spring plowing, silkworm busy season, and rice transplanting season in rural areas, there will be less goods arriving. New grain usually appears around the Double Ten Festival, so the real period of scarcity will be in July and August. However, at that time, the Yangtze River will rise, and Sichuan rice can be transported downstream. On the one hand, there will be imported rice to supplement, which can be maintained.

Please Issue Wheat Loans

[Reported by this newspaper] At the second meeting of the Price Evaluation Committee a few days ago, it was resolved to request the Central Government to issue this year's wheat loans within half a month. It is reported that last year's wheat loans were determined in April together with grain loans. Later, due to the grain loan case, the organizers of the wheat loan were extremely cautious in drafting the terms, and it was delayed until August before it was issued. However, at this time, the wheat order had passed, and the flour manufacturers did not need loans. The wheat arriving in various places mostly fell into the hands of wealthy third parties. This has a great relationship with the high prices of wheat and flour. The manufacturers have also stopped work one after another due to the lack of raw materials, and have fallen into a situation where they cannot maintain themselves. This year will be May, with this lesson learned first, in order to avoid repeating the same mistake and for the survival of manufacturers and future grain prices, we specially ask the Central Government to issue loans as soon as possible.

### Dye Works Making Profits Outside of Core Business; Cotton Yarn Market Sentiment Regains Excitement — Cotton Cloth Prices Show Mixed Trends of Rise and Fall —

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions: At the opening, due to the stagnation of the Chinese stock market, people were weak and timid, and quotations lacked excitement. Later, dyeing and weaving factories in this street made up for losses, and external idle funds also came in to absorb inventory, suddenly causing the market sentiment to turn firm. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose from 12.15 million to 12.35 million yuan, a continuous increase of 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was priced at 7.15 million yuan, also up 300,000 yuan. The prices of other yarn counts all increased compared to the previous day, ranging from 120,000 to 400,000 yuan.

The cotton cloth market also lacked energy at the opening yesterday due to the securities market shutdown. Subsequently, with easing credit, dye works absorbed inventory at low prices, and idle funds also arrived, making purchases continuously. Market prices began to soar. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once fell to 274,500 yuan, but eventually reached 286,000 yuan, only a slight increase of 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a large supply of Five Blessings fine cloth in stock, with prices down 3,000 yuan. Yuan cloth, Yuan twill, and blue cloth, etc., were also lower, ranging from 5,000 to 120,000 yuan. Bleached cloth, fine twill, poplin, etc., rose by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, up to 15,000 yuan.

### Rayon Restores Allotment; Yesterday's Market Falls Back by One Million Yuan

The rayon market yesterday fell sharply by one million yuan compared to the previous day because the Central Trust Bureau decided to resume rayon allotment to the silk weaving industry starting next week, and it was expected that the joint venture company would also release raw silk. Therefore, people's sentiment was exceptionally weak. 120-count High Gloss, opened low, with no one interested at 7 million yuan, and then continued to soften, with the lowest bid at 6.7 million yuan, eventually fluctuating to close at the opening price. In the afternoon, due to a lack of supply, the price was bid up to 7.2 million yuan. Toyo Gold Three Horses, etc., all declined, and 75-count Semi-Gloss was also bid down by one million yuan.

Although the silk filature market lacked transactions yesterday, calculating the future cost of new silk still required exceeding the market price. Therefore, holders insisted on raising prices, with quotations rising uniformly. Especially for A-grade stocks, which were extremely scarce, the quoted price was higher, reaching 22 million yuan. C-grade was quoted at 21 million yuan, and high uniformity was quoted separately at 20.05 million yuan. However, there were no transactions. Dry filature prices also rose by 500,000 yuan yesterday.

The silk market was slightly stagnant yesterday. Hua Jin crepe and matte spun silk, etc., saw their market prices decrease slightly by 500 to 1,000 yuan due to the decrease in rayon prices. Comforter cover prices remained unchanged. Da Cheng checkered Bi crepe sold for 30,800 to 1,000 yuan, slightly lower than the latter market on the previous day. The Monday term traded at 1,200 yuan yesterday.

### Sugar Prices Mixed

Yesterday's sugar market saw mixed ups and downs, with a steady trend. The association's Peruvian sugar initially went for 385,000 yuan, then to 395,000 yuan, and after 400,500 yuan it slightly loosened, going for 395,000 to 398,000 yuan, finally settling at 400,500 yuan, up by over 10,000 yuan. 24 Coarse White spot goods were priced at 425,000 yuan, and warehouse receipts at 400,500 yuan. 20 Medium White spot goods were priced at 380,000 yuan, down by a small amount. Warehouse receipts were priced at 365,000 yuan. 4.5 Semi-Military White spot goods were priced at 400,000 yuan, and 3.5 Semi-Military White warehouse receipts at 380,000 yuan. Taiwanese Red warehouse receipts were priced at 315,000 to 310,000 yuan. Tianjin Qing was priced at 260,000 yuan, and Shunde Qing at 255,000 to 250,000 yuan, both down by 5,000 yuan. Xinghua Red was priced at 275,000 yuan, and high-quality goods at 280,000 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Dyeing and Weaving Industry Requests Revision of Measures for Transshipping Cloth to Hankou

The eight associations of the cotton cloth association and the machinery dyeing and weaving industry in this city are quite dissatisfied with the authorities' recent regulations on transshipping yarn and cloth, particularly the special control over Hankou. Yesterday, Pan Shih-hao and Wu Guo-bin, chairman of the Textile Control Committee, stated three points: (1) The control of yarn and cloth has spread throughout the country. It is inappropriate to impose special control over Hankou in this regulation. Because Hankou is the central location of the interior, it is inconvenient for various merchants from the interior to come to Shanghai, and most go to Hankou to purchase goods. Special control over Hankou would inconvenience these merchants. (2) The customs declaration system should be revised. (3) Niche goods such as patterned cloth and fine flannel are mostly produced by small factories and should be treated as exceptions. Mayor Wu agreed to submit the first point for discussion at the next Textile Control Committee meeting. For the second point, the customs declaration, which is a technical issue, he instructed Pan to contact Liu Wen-teng, the director of the Textile Control Committee's business department. For the third point, the issue of niche goods, Wu agreed to have Liu Wen-teng study and handle it.

### Orchid Bamboo Branches Slightly Slack

Recently, the sales of orchid bamboo branches have been relatively slow, and merchants are not greedy. The current firm opened dozens of boxes. Kui orchid bamboo was priced at 760,000 yuan, and ordinary orchid bamboo at 520,000 yuan, both down by 120,000 yuan.

### Exchange Rates in Fuzhou, Changsha, and Other Places Are Adjusted Regularly; Internal Exchange Rate Panel of National Banks and Bureaus Decides

[Report from this newspaper] The 38th panel meeting on internal exchange business of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury was held yesterday afternoon at the business bureau of the Central Bank. Based on the results of inquiries from the branches of the Bank of China in various locations regarding the internal exchange situation, it was decided to adjust the exchange rates for the following locations starting from the 19th of this month.

Specifically, Fuzhou will charge 80 yuan per thousand yuan (previously 95 yuan). Changsha, Hengyang, and other locations in the Hunan region will all charge 50 yuan (previously 75 yuan). All locations in the Henan region will charge 50 yuan (previously 75 yuan). Lianyungang (Xinpu) will charge 12 yuan (previously 10 yuan). Hankou and Wuchang in the Hubei region will both charge 30 yuan (previously 65 yuan). Shashi and other locations will all charge 50 yuan (previously 75 yuan). Hangzhou will charge 2 yuan (previously 3 yuan). Chongqing will charge 10 yuan (previously 15 yuan). Xufu and Wanxian will both charge 50 yuan (previously 40 yuan). The Shanxi region will charge 10 yuan (previously 5 yuan). Guizhou and Yunnan will both charge 40 yuan (previously 30 yuan).

It was also learned that, according to investigations, funds are still tight in the markets of Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places, so the original rates will be maintained at 95 yuan. Yesterday, the internal exchange rates of commercial banks and firms were 100 to 120 yuan in Guangzhou, 20 yuan in Xi'an, and 30 to 45 yuan in Hankou.

### Valedine Sales are Brisk

Valedine has been selling briskly lately, and merchants from various places have been continuously demanding it. The tailoring of Western suits and the sale of materials for Chinese clothing have both been lively. Due to the shortage of feather yarn tweed, the market sales are even more prosperous than in previous years. Furthermore, the lack of striped valedine has led to increased sales of rice-yellow and gray plain colors. Sales of American goods have been quite strong, but recently, due to the dark colors, transactions have been less frequent. Dark blue is only sold for upper garments, so sales have been sluggish, and the price is 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per yard lower than gray. Yesterday, ordinary local valedine was selling for 220,000 to 230,000 yuan per yard, American goods for 200,000 yuan, and British goods for around 300,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Weak and Unable to Revive; Si'an Newly Fried Green Tea is Highly Priced

Chinese tea has always occupied a considerable position in the international market, but currently, overseas offers are frequently shrinking. The production cost of Chinese tea is increasing daily due to the rising prices of all goods, threatening exports. Recently, the situation has become even more dire, with no signs of revival. Those engaged in this industry are gradually becoming unable to sustain themselves due to the freezing of funds.

It is learned that people in the industry are eagerly hoping for assistance from the authorities to save them from a serious crisis. As for the various domestic sales of tea varieties, stores and merchants in this street have been involved in them in the past week. The process is in equilibrium between supply and demand, and there is still a lack of volatility. However, among them, jasmine tea, baked tea, and this year's Wenzhou new flag gun tea are relatively firm because both production and inventory are low. It is also learned that Si'an's newly fried green tea has suddenly attracted attention in Tianjin and other places, but the sellers are asking for exorbitant prices, demanding as high as 800,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the high price, and actual transactions are rare.

### Salt Insurance Premium Rate Increased by 1.5 Yuan; Insurance Companies Refuse to Accept

Insurance companies in this city have been suffering losses due to frequent accidents in the water transport of Sichuan-Kang salt, mainly caused by excessive over-insurance. Therefore, various companies have requested the Ministry of Finance to adjust the premium rate. Now, the Salt Administration has verified and approved an increase of 1.5 yuan to the old rate (5 yuan). This was approved by the Ministry of Finance yesterday (16th). However, the adjusted premium rate is too small, and various companies are still unable to underwrite. The authority to stipulate or adjust insurance premium rates originally belongs to the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance. This time, the Salt Administration verified and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance for approval, so the industry has decided to reject it and has lodged a serious protest with the salt administration authorities.

### A Glimpse of the United Nations Headquarters at Lake Success, New York

— Special Correspondent Luo Bao reports from New York on the 10th, translated by the editorial office of this newspaper

The United Nations Headquarters at Lake Success, New York, has a vibrant atmosphere and a fresh look, sometimes resembling a colored film set, complete with cameras, reflectors, and beautiful women. However, the three thousand employees of the United Nations prefer to call it the "Instrument Factory." Originally, this flat-topped building was the site of the Sperry Gyroscope Co. during the war. Now it has been completely transformed, and no one recognizes it anymore. Only one building in Queen still manufactures secret instruments for the U.S. Navy.

The vast space of this "Instrument Factory" has been divided into many small offices and long corridors, with the walls painted in cream or blue-gray.

Offices are Magnificent

The Security Council's office is the most luxurious and visible to the public. Colleagues who need sunlight and fresh air occasionally gaze at the Security Council's magnificent offices to invigorate their tired spirits.

The Security Council meets two or three times a week, and anyone can obtain free admission tickets by calling a day or two before the meeting. Female tour guides from Paris or Chongqing, London or Brooklyn lead visitors to their seats, which number five hundred and fourteen, with chairs covered in tomato-red cushions. Some seats are only a few feet away from the oak conference table where the eleven representatives of the Security Council sit.

Representatives Arrive Late

These representatives often arrive late, fifteen or twenty minutes after the scheduled meeting time, followed by a large group of assistants. They sit down at the outer edge of the horseshoe-shaped conference table, their faces appearing very serious. The two ends of the conference table face the visitors.

The seats of the representatives change monthly. Currently, the British and American representatives sit at one end on the left side of the audience, and the Soviet Union's Gromyko sits at the other end. He often gets angry, shakes his head, or points a pencil at the other end of the conference table, where the British and American representatives sit. When his opponents respond, he sits upright, with a serious demeanor. But no matter what he does, he always attracts the attention of the audience.

Thirty-Nine Year Old Gromyko

Gromyko is only thirty-nine years old this year, and he gives people a dark impression. He usually wears black clothes, has black hair, and his glasses also have black frames. His voice is deep and somber, giving a sense of gloom. When Gromyko is chairman, he speaks fluent English, but when he speaks as the Soviet representative, he speaks Russian and often expresses dissatisfaction with the English translation of his speech.

Translators with Amazing Memory

The translators sit inside the curved conference table. When representatives speak in French, they translate it into English, and when they speak in English, they translate it into French. If a representative speaks in another language, it must be translated into both English and French. These linguists are mostly French. They extract the main points and rely on their amazing memory to translate the lengthy speeches sentence by sentence. They often imitate the gestures of the speakers and often translate satirical and sharp words one by one. Sometimes, they also embellish harsh words that slip out. For example, when one representative accuses another of "lying," it may be translated as "an unfortunate error."

Conference Room White Light Shining

Non-glare indirect light is emitted from the aluminum grid on the ceiling of the conference room, looking like ice trays in an electric refrigerator. Special reflectors are also hidden in the ceiling for news photographers to use when filming. With the flip of a switch, the entire conference room is bathed in brilliant white light, and at the same time, you can hear the sound of cameras clicking around the conference room. At this time, the representatives can remain calm. If the lights suddenly turn on or off while they are speaking, they never miss a single word, knowing that the photographers will not pay attention to their words.

News reporters sit behind the audience seats. Because the lighting is poor, the representatives cannot see them clearly, so they can work calmly. Before each meeting, they are busy talking to representatives from various countries, but half of the reporters are actually doing nothing, just watching the excitement.

This is the best opportunity for Americans to talk to Gromyko. The British representatives hate outsiders interfering with their leisure time, but Gromyko welcomes them. He speaks to anyone. When you ask him about the United Nations, he will tell you that he cannot answer at the moment. Then, he will ask you about recent cases and snippets of American life.

Bar Has Everything

The representatives never drink alcohol in the lounge. There is a bar there with everything from cider to Russian brandy. But the waiters are terribly bored. If Gromyko drank a cocktail before a meeting, it would be telegraphed to newspapers in Western countries as news. He has only drunk a glass of milk in public.

The private lives of the other representatives are also equally serious. But the news reporters are different. After they finish their work, they often gather in the bar and have a good time. Thirty boxes of beverages are supplied here every day. Coca-Cola is the most popular, and orange juice is also quite popular.

Employees with Good Annual Salaries

Half of the United Nations headquarters staff are Americans, but most Americans have been replaced by people from other countries. The next largest number are French, accounting for about 11% of the total staff. The number of Soviet people is very small.

The annual salary of United Nations headquarters staff ranges from a minimum of $1,380 to a maximum of $40,000 paid to Secretary-General Trygve Lie, which is better than the salaries of U.S. government officials and is exempt from income tax.

Currently, 200 temporary employees are hired specifically to assist with all matters related to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the Palestine issue. This meeting is also an excellent program for the audience, but seating is limited to 300, first-come, first-served.

The United Nations General Assembly is held in a building at the former site of the World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, New York. From there, take the subway to Lake Success, which requires only one coin. Or you can take an electric train from Pennsylvania Station, which takes about thirty minutes.

### On the Eve of British Withdrawal from India; Partition of India; Indian Political Situation in Evolution

— By airmail from Delhi on the 2nd; special correspondent of this newspaper Zhou Xiangguang

The internal problem of India — the inability of the Hindu and Muslim religions to reach a satisfactory political solution — has been going on for almost two or three decades. Although there have been meetings between Gandhi and Jinnah, round table conferences in Shimla, and visits to India by Lord Lawrence, the British Cabinet's Secretary of State for India, Alexander, the Minister of Defense, and Cripps, the Minister of Commerce, the deadlock between Hindus and Muslims could not be resolved. Until recently, the British Cabinet announced its withdrawal from India in June 1948, returning power to the Indians. At the same time, it transferred the unexpired term of Viceroy Wavell and replaced him with General Mountbatten. The situation took a sharp turn, and the conflict between Hindus and Muslims became more apparent. Their respective viewpoints became increasingly different. The Indian National Congress, formed mainly by Hindus, hoped for a unified India, which is based on a geographical viewpoint. The Muslim League, organized by Muslims, hoped for the partition of India, establishing Pakistan and Hindustan, because Hindus and Muslims differ in race, language, writing, culture, and customs, and it is feared that it will be difficult to live together permanently. This is based on the standpoint of ethnic strata. Both arguments have their reasons and receive the support of the people of both religions.

Muslim League Hopes for Partition of India

In the 1940 resolution in Lahore, the Muslim League announced that the areas included in the so-called Pakistan referred to the Northwest Frontier Province, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan in northwestern India, and Bengal and Assam in eastern India. If India is divided according to this division, then the two major corners of the triangular Indian landmass will be occupied by the Muslim League. However, the central part of the other corner, such as the two large princely states of Hyderabad and Bhopal, is ruled by Muslims and may have a considerable relationship with Jinnah, with the possibility of uniting with Pakistan in the future. Therefore, in terms of military geography, Pakistan actually has the potential to threaten Hindustan. At the same time, Calcutta in eastern Bengal and Karachi in western Sindh are two of the three major seaports in India. In terms of commercial economy, Pakistan almost controls the hub of Indian trade with the eastern and western oceans. Therefore, since the areas of Pakistan have military and economic advantages, they will inevitably be opposed by the National Congress. However, the power of the Muslim League is also considerable. On the one hand, the Muslim population is about 90 million. Moreover, the Hindu caste system is strict, and the so-called "untouchable class" accounts for 60 million people, who are despised by the "Brahmin class." Islam advocates the equal idea that all humans are brothers. Therefore, the "untouchable class" in Hinduism either converts to Islam or supports the Muslim League. When the Indian interim government was reorganized last year, the Muslim League specially recommended Mr. Mandal, the Secretary-General of the "untouchable class" alliance, as the Minister of Justice. This is the best example to prove that they support the Muslim League. Moreover, the British Cabinet does not want a bloody tragedy to occur in India before its withdrawal. Therefore, it seems to agree to the partition of India between Hindus and Muslims.

Governors of Each Province Will Be Indian

According to news from the Muslim League, Governor-General Mountbatten will soon issue a document stating that in principle, he accepts the plan to partition India into "Hindustan" and "Pakistan." The Muslim League also expects the Viceroy to establish a border committee to delineate the Hindu-majority and Muslim-majority areas. At the same time, he may revise the Indian government organization law, with the Governor-General serving as the constitutional leader and an Indian-Hindu cabinet and a Muslim cabinet responsible to Mountbatten. Regarding the administration of "Hindustan" and "Pakistan," the Governor-General, after consulting with the Indian-Hindu and Muslim cabinets, will be responsible for appointing the governors of each province. In the future, the governors of each province in India will all be Indians. From this, we can see that the trend of partitioning India between Hindus and Muslims seems to have been determined. What is being considered is which of the eleven British-ruled provinces will be governed by the Muslim League.

Jinnah Argues that Bengal and Punjab Must Not Be Divided Again

The National Congress is also unwilling to give up six provinces to the Muslim League as compensation. Thinking that the Muslim League will establish Pakistan in the vast territory of India, some Sikhs may also establish a Sikhstan in the Punjab province of the proposed Pakistan. At the same time, the Hindu and Muslim populations in Bengal province are equal, so how can Hindus be ruled by Muslims? Therefore, the All-India Maha Sabha Party, which is based in Bengal province, advocates that Bengal province must also be partitioned to weaken the power of the Muslim League. Seeing that the situation was not good, Jinnah issued a document on April 30, the eve of the meeting of the National Congress Executive Committee, reiterating that Pakistan includes the six provinces announced by the Muslim League in the past and that Bengal and Punjab provinces must not be divided again. In terms of population, they must migrate to each other, and defense should also be separated. Otherwise, it is difficult to imagine what the overall situation will be like in the future. Less than a few tens of minutes after this statement was issued, Baru, a veteran of the National Congress and the current chairman of the Constituent Assembly, also expressed his opinion, opposing Jinnah's proposal, saying that if Muslims and non-Muslims want to implement partition, they must implement thorough partition, that is, Bengal and Punjab provinces must also be partitioned. Jinnah cannot want both, and so on. Therefore, the conflict between the two sides became more acute, but the problem must be solved. Arguing is not a good thing, so the National Congress invited the old man Gandhi from Bihar province to Delhi under the scorching heat of summer.

Collect Opinions and Submit Them to London for Resolution

Looking at the current development of the situation, there seems to be no problem with Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh provinces belonging to Pakistan, because the cabinets of these three provinces are all formed by the Muslim League. However, the cabinet of the Northwest Frontier Province is presided over by the National Congress. A general election was held last year, and the result was that it did not participate in Pakistan. Therefore, recently, the Muslim League has requested a re-election to solicit public opinion and overthrow the current National Congress cabinet. The situation is developing. In short, the situation between Hindus and Muslims is becoming more and more complicated. Governor-General Mountbatten has to submit their opinions to London for resolution. But what can be decided at present is that the partition of Hindus and Muslims is already determined. The name "India" will also no longer exist in the future.

### The French Political Parties' Overt and Covert Struggles: The Mystery of De Gaulle's Party Formation

— A Dispatch from Paris, April 28th. Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

This time, my arrival in Paris coincided with a major political upheaval in France. General de Gaulle delivered two earth-shattering speeches, one on the anniversary of the victory over Germany in Boulogne-Billancourt, and the other on the second anniversary of the liberation of Alsace in Strasbourg. The content of the speeches has already been reported domestically. The gist is dissatisfaction with the current political situation in France, dissatisfaction with the existing constitution, and dissatisfaction with the "spoils system" and irresponsible current cabinet. He reviewed the decline of French party politics after the First World War, warning that today's political situation in France is still following the tragic path of the Reynaud-Daladier era. Therefore, he called for the organization of a "Rally of the French People," advocating fundamental constitutional changes, overthrowing the current situation, and creating a new era for France.

De Gaulle's Meeting with Ramadier

Like a pool of still water disturbed by pebbles, French political society was stirred up. The French Communist Party's newspaper, "L'Humanité," was the first to reveal that De Gaulle was a "yes-man" of Truman's "Greek-Turkish loan," that De Gaulle's mind was full of fascist germs, and that he was dreaming of a French dictatorship. The Socialist Prime Minister Ramadier, after De Gaulle's first speech (March 30th), personally went to visit General de Gaulle at his small white house near Neuilly to exchange views. Afterwards, Ramadier told reporters that he admired General de Gaulle because he was the "hero who saved France," but given his position, it seemed questionable to express opinions completely contrary to the government's goals in front of foreign envoys on the anniversary of the victory over Germany. A week after Ramadier's meeting with De Gaulle, the second speech in Strasbourg, accompanied by "spring thunder" after the rain, rang out again. This time, in addition to the British and Canadian ambassadors, the American ambassador was also present, with an audience of over 20,000 people. In that speech, he formally proposed the plan to "form a party." De Gaulle himself did not call it a "party" because he repeatedly mentioned "opposing the spoils system of party politics, opposing irresponsible coalition cabinets." Therefore, he named it the "Rally of the French People." But since it is a political union of the people, with propositions and ambitions, even if it is not called a "party," in practice, in a democratic country, it is still a political party. French newspapers call De Gaulle's new "party" the RPF (the abbreviation for Rally of the French People).

The question now is: Why does General de Gaulle want to form a party? Who is the target of the party formation? What is the background?

Unveiling the New Banner of Fighting France

Let me start with the era of the war against Germany.

In June 1940, Hitler launched a large-scale invasion of France, and the Maginot Line fell in three weeks. The Reynaud government surrendered. At that time, De Gaulle, as a colonel in the army, acting Deputy Minister of the Army, at the Supreme Defense Council, on the day it was decided to surrender with pain, the meeting was filled with gloom, and everyone could not come up with an idea. Only De Gaulle stood up and shouted: "No." That very day, De Gaulle fled to London and raised the clear banner of "Fighting France."

After the Soviet-German war broke out, the French left, especially the French Communist Party, enthusiastically participated in the war of resistance. At that time, the strength of De Gaulle's leadership was concentrated overseas. At that time, the underground movement in France was led by the French Communist Party and some so-called leftists who sympathized with the Communist Party. They had an organization called the "National Resistance Council," abbreviated as CNL. The CNL also issued a "Combat Program," which was later recognized and approved by De Gaulle.

The "Combat Program" emphasized that the foreign invasion of France was the result of French monopoly capital manipulating French politics. "When the Nazi fascist iron hooves occupied French territory, monopoly capital, trusts, cooperated with Germany and sold out the interests of the country." Therefore, the slogan of the CNL was "Down with Nazi fascism, nationalization of enterprises, liquidation of capitalists." At that time, Communist leader Thorez was staying in Moscow, and his followers manipulated the CNL.

Shortly after the liberation of Paris, De Gaulle led a team of civil and military officials back to Paris. The CNL also came out of the underground movement and into the open. When I first came to Paris the year before last summer, the left and right were still largely united. The Nazis were overthrown, and "French traitors" were brought to trial one by one. In particular, "French traitor" journalists, regardless of age, were ordered to be shot by De Gaulle. Newspapers that published treasonous opinions were confiscated and nationalized. Large trusts such as Renault Motors (Renault, pronounced "uh-no" in French), a part of which cooperated with the German army to produce aircraft, were confiscated and nationalized. Renault himself was arrested and imprisoned. (Later I heard he died in prison, but this has not been confirmed.) Many of the "Combat Program" proposals put forward by the so-called leftists were once vigorously implemented. The French said that many big capitalists at that time hid in the countryside, living in seclusion, fearing that their property would be confiscated, and rushed to buy US dollars. It is said that the reason why the black market for US dollars in Paris has not disappeared to this day is due to that time.

Leading the Left and Right for a Year: A Great Unity

From VE Day to around VE Day a year later, was the period of great unity (or united period) of the left and right under De Gaulle's leadership. The merits and demerits of that time have now become the focus of debate. In a recent press conference, De Gaulle himself boasted quite a bit about the "renaissance atmosphere" of that time. However, the French Socialist Party and the Communist Party, which are in charge of the current cabinet, have attacked the "bad policies" of De Gaulle's administration everywhere. The second day I arrived in Paris, I read the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune, and its editorial was titled "Bad Record." The editorial praised De Gaulle as a French national hero, but "unfortunately, the bad record of his administration in 1944 and 1945" ruined De Gaulle's future.

In 1945, I was in Paris. At that time, the political appearance was that the left and right were quite unified. Although the people in power were all De Gaulle's "heroes," the left's combat program was also being implemented step by step. The slogan of state-owned enterprises was very loud, but because capitalists were fleeing, most of the factories were shut down, production was lacking, and even food, daily necessities, and clothing were scarce.

At that time, De Gaulle began to deploy his political power. He greatly increased the treatment of soldiers and increased the huge national defense budget. Some people said that at that time, 2,000 of the most sophisticated houses in Paris were requisitioned by military agencies or soldiers. The "headquarters" of Passy, who originally worked with De Gaulle on "special operations," also appeared publicly at that time. Passy ran a "Research and Statistics Bureau," a news agency, and also handled many of De Gaulle's publicity matters.

Before Stepping Down, the Two Major Parties, the Socialists and Communists, Launched Attacks

At that time, De Gaulle adopted a laissez-faire policy towards government civil servants. The agencies were overstaffed, with many redundant personnel and little efficiency. A few days before De Gaulle stepped down, the newspapers of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party openly accused De Gaulle of hindering the nationalization of enterprises and colluding with the big arms dealer Schneider, "selling out the left's combat program."

Political chaos began at that time. The Socialist Party was the first to break away from De Gaulle's leadership. The Communist Party shouted and made a lot of noise, demanding that De Gaulle "get out." Although at that time, De Gaulle denied the civil rights of Communist leader Thorez (on the grounds that he evaded military service during the war), the French Communist Party firmly controlled the "General Confederation of Labor," and the five million industrial workers in France became strong supporters of the Communist Party. The "Popular Republican Movement," which originally had the closest relationship with General de Gaulle, also had its leadership fall into the hands of Bidault and a group of Catholics because of different views on the constitution.

He Advocates Revising the New Constitution to Correct Past Mistakes

Here, I should describe General de Gaulle's views on the constitution of the French "Fourth Republic." I don't remember the exact date, but it was probably shortly after returning to Paris. At that time, I was in Paris and listened to several of De Gaulle's speeches. He loudly called on the French people to recognize the lessons of the 1940 tragedy. He said: "The suffering of France originated from the fact that the constitution of the Third Republic was too bad. The constitution encouraged party politics, and the cabinet changed a little every three days and a lot every five days. The parties and factions either fought each other or shared the spoils... The national defense budget was reduced, and national defense was lax..." Therefore, he advocated that the new constitution of the "Fourth Republic" should thoroughly correct past mistakes and produce a relatively centralized, effective new constitution that would not create party infighting.

In fact, the constitution of the Fourth Republic, after more than a year of "difficult birth," was finally voted on by the people, and there was not much difference from the era of the Third Republic. In other words, the current French constitution is democratic, not centralized. It is party politics, not oligarchy. The "constitutional norm" of France is still following the old path before 1940, regardless of whether this old path is a "repetition of mistakes" or a broad road.

De Gaulle gave two speeches attacking the new constitution on June 16 and September 29 last year. The two most brilliant sentences were: "The so-called referendum on the new constitution, nine million voters approved, eight million voters rejected, and another eight million voters abstained. How can such a constitution be promulgated and implemented?" But in fact, the new constitution was finally implemented!

(Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)

### After the Establishment of the Rally of the French People

The "Rally of the French People" was formally announced on April 14th recently. Before its establishment, De Gaulle had sharply criticized the new constitution in two speeches. He also said that many talented people in France are unable to exert their strengths because they cannot infiltrate the circles of political parties. The current political situation in France is controlled by mediocre and incompetent people or people with ulterior motives. As a result, the Vietnam problem and the Madagascar problem have come one after another, and the government has been overwhelmed. In the past two weeks, how many people has the "Rally of the French People" absorbed? How will the "Rally of the French People" strive for power in the future? It is impossible to know now. Generally speaking, relying on De Gaulle's personal prestige and his immortal achievements of "saving the country single-handedly," he certainly has great appeal to France's spirited youth and to the French military. The day before yesterday, Communist members of parliament proposed to enact laws to prohibit French soldiers from attending De Gaulle's speeches, saying that De Gaulle was in danger of inciting civil war. The French Communist Party's "L'Humanité" also published "insider information" about De Gaulle's collusion with the French army. One day, "L'Humanité" said: "Now, in the French Army General Staff Headquarters, there are two of De Gaulle's offices. What qualifications does he have to openly issue documents and implement measures in the General Staff Headquarters?"

"L'Humanité" also drafted a list of future cabinet members for De Gaulle, titled: "What if De Gaulle comes to power?" The first item on the list was: "Minister of the Interior Passy (De Gaulle's intelligence chief). Minister of National Defense Schneider."

Schneider is a French arms dealer, similar to Krupp in Germany. Some people say that the Schneider and De Gaulle families are related, or have a nepotistic relationship. The French people also believe that all of De Gaulle's political activities are due to Schneider's economic support. Therefore, the political program and policies proposed by De Gaulle each time emphasize national defense and increasing the military budget. Is this kind of argument excessive? Is there a bit of "measuring the heart of a gentleman with the belly of a petty person"? I cannot tell.

However, the consequence of the facts is that the military supports De Gaulle, and arms dealers are also bound to be happy with De Gaulle. After De Gaulle's speech in Strasbourg this time, slogans of "Long live De Gaulle" were written everywhere in Paris. There is also a colorful printed poster, a map of France, with De Gaulle armed with a sword, standing in the middle, with the large characters "Strasbourg" written on it. This poster is almost pasted all over the streets and alleys of Paris. "L'Humanité" estimates that just the printing cost alone would be more than 1.5 million francs. Therefore, its conclusion is: "Where does De Gaulle get this money? Of course, it was supplied by Schneider!"

British Newspapers Say France Needs Stability, Not Change

When Wallace arrived in England, he fired a cannon in London. He said: De Gaulle's formation of a party is a response to Truman's anti-Soviet and anti-communist policy. (Wallace did not mention De Gaulle during his three-day stay in Paris). The day before yesterday, "L'Humanité" published a message saying that De Gaulle's formation of a party was subsidized by the US government. The American reporters here immediately sent the telegram back, and the Paris edition of the Herald Tribune added a note: "A kind of ignorant and tragic propaganda."

There are dozens of newspapers of all kinds in Paris, all with strong "partisan spirit," which is clearly different from Britain and the United States. De Gaulle's own "Le Combat," as well as the Catholic "Le Figaro," which supports De Gaulle, defend De Gaulle every day. The Socialist Party, which started by pleasing everyone, still inherits the tradition of Léon Blum, and its attitude is relatively cautious. Most of France is now in the hands of the Socialist Party, and Prime Minister Ramadier rarely mentions De Gaulle. A few days ago, there was a rumor in Paris that Ramadier visited "Neuilly White Mansion" for the second time at night. The Socialist Party's "Le Populaire" greatly published Ramadier's "denial" the next day.

French President Auriol, a veteran of the Socialist Party, is now on a tour of North Africa and West Africa. On the day the President boarded a ship at the Toulon naval port, De Gaulle's speech was just published. Someone asked Auriol for his opinion on this issue. The President only answered one sentence: "What France needs today is stability, not change."

This sentence coincides with the editorial of the London Times. The Times did not criticize the rights and wrongs of General de Gaulle, but his objective opinion was that "although France's recovery and construction is too slow, it is, in any case, on the road to progress. What France needs is stability, not change." Although these words are too "mature," as a foreign journalist, that's probably all I can say!

### Requesting that Yingshi University be Moved to Huzhou

Editor:

Yingshi University was founded during the war, and its campus was originally located in Huzhou to commemorate the revolutionary martyr Chen Yingshi. After the victory, the Ministry of Education changed its plan and ordered it to be moved to Jinhua. I am a student from Huzhou studying in Shanghai. I know that education in Huzhou is developed. Not only do the nearby counties have middle schools, but there are seven secondary schools in the urban area. Many university students from Huzhou study in Shanghai, which shows that Huzhou needs a university very much. I sincerely hope that the Ministry of Education will promote Huzhou's culture and education and revitalize the national spirit by ordering Yingshi University to be moved to Huzhou, so as to match its name with reality. On the one hand, the students of Yingshi University should also agree with this move, so that it will be beneficial. (Xie Zhongzhi)

### On Modern French Painting: Shaping and Reality in Painting

— Liu Shi

The so-called "shaping" in painting ultimately aims at the purification of painting, and is the process of grasping that purity. The so-called purification of painting means the isolation of painting, and also has the significance of reducing painting. Therefore, no matter how we look at any lines on the screen, they are not meant to explain the objects of nature. As mentioned before, the so-called purification of painting aims at grasping the independent world of painting. This world of pure painting does not adopt "nature-object," but can be said to adopt "tablean-object." The so-called natural phenomenon, needless to say, means selecting the natural objects faced by the painter as the subject matter of painting without changing their original form. As mentioned before, it can mean that this is a method of grasping natural objects according to the order of nature without change, and does not clearly define the isolated world of painting or its position. The so-called "tablean-object" does not necessarily mean rejecting all the objects faced by the painter, but simply rejecting the impure attitude of handling them according to the natural order. This point is intended to start from the painting world of the screen first, so that the subject matter being handled has been isolated into the object of painting data, and has been incorporated into the category of painting data. Therefore, even if we do not see the original image of nature in the subject matter, as long as it is a painting image, it is fine. This image does not have to be limited to an abstract image. Even if it has a concrete natural image, it must be said that it is being placed in an isolated category or painting order that is different from the natural order. We specifically call this object that has been placed in the pure painting order "tablean-object."

The reason why we call a "tablean-object" - that is, a "Formation" that forms a pure painting. This Formation is due to pure painting lines, pure painting light colors and composition, making the screen unified into a completed artistic form. The so-called unification of the screen into a completed artistic form is different from being completely artistic. The so-called artistic completeness, although it is the result that can be obtained from an evaluation, the so-called unification of painting into a completed artistic form here is the completion of expression, and is intended to be the end of the creation process. It implies the meaning of separating from the expression of the painter as the creator and becoming a completed artistic form called a work. This is the meaning of "shaping" in painting. After this, the value judgment of painting has become a different world from the "shaping" of painting. Therefore, the so-called painting technique is a pure meaning, and is the painting "formation." Because it has been unified into an artistic form that has been achieved in painting, its mission has been fully completed. This does not mean the disappearance of technique, but that the process of so-called painting "shaping" is sublimated into the so-called artistic form of painting.

We have no doubt that the modern French art scene is trying this kind of painting "shaping," and is exploring the point of pure painting expression. If I start from such a general examination and break into more specific questions, then the so-called purity of modern French painting all belongs to the pursuit of reality in painting. If we see the traces of the pursuit of the natural state of painting in 19th century painting, then current French painting is moving into this world of reality.

The so-called reality in painting must be the unique reality (Verite) of painting that is different from the natural truth. All reality in painting is dedicated to the reality of the artistic world, and is the reality that has been placed in the so-called orderly world of painting. In other words, reality in painting can be said to be reality that has been studied, felt, and established in the so-called total world. This kind of reality is fundamentally separated from the natural, realistic kind of reality, and has artistic joy and artistic beauty. Therefore, we specifically call this reality belonging to the artistic world pseudo-realism. It contains the meaning of the artistic feeling that the artist has, and can be said to be a reality belonging to the aspect of sensibility. Therefore, regarding this kind of reality in painting, it is possible that due to the difference in the painting attitude held by each painter towards painting, different appearances will appear.

We can broadly divide the attitudes seen in the painters of the modern Paris School into the following types:

There is a kind of energy for painting that emphasizes the painter's visual sensibility. They want to express the reality felt by vision in a "painting" way. Therefore, we call it visual realism (Realite de Vision). Although we call it visual realism, it would be inappropriate to equate it with the vision of 19th-century Impressionism because it has the so-called vision. The vision belonging to the Indian School is a mechanical vision that looks at nature realistically, and is neither separated from nature nor has any isolation from itself. That is, there is no artistic isolated attitude, nor is it a vision that is included in the category of the so-called isolated world of painting. It is just a vision that looks at the phenomena given by nature in the state of existence according to nature. However, the vision we call here is a vision that is included in the artistic category, and is a vision that sees things within the scope of the artistic state of existence. The so-called vision that sees things in the artistic state of existence may sound a bit strange, but it is not a vision that sees things in this true natural state, but refers to a kind of vision that has the so-called artistic and painting tendencies.

The second kind of painting attitude is to attach importance to the painter's perceptual sensibility, and want to express the reality felt by perception in a painting way. Therefore, I call it perceptual realism (Realite de Connaisance).

The so-called Comaisance (perception) about painting still means a kind of perception about painting, which is the perception felt when the center of that sensibility is regarded as the intellectually bottom center. This is very strongly manifested in the modern French art scene. At least the point of exploring intellectually bottom sensibility is one of the modern characteristics.

This indicated that Tsurumi had exhausted his Judo skills. Why did he need to use such a grand maneuver? And what was the purpose of this maneuver? It was because he knew that his opponent must have practiced a special type of footwork, capable of always staying behind the enemy, no matter how you turned, he would always be one step ahead of you, constantly sticking to your back. Therefore, he decided on this method: jumping forward was to lure the opponent to follow, but unexpectedly performing a headstand, somersaulting back to the original spot; this way, no matter what, the opponent could no longer cling to his form. Moreover, the opponent sticking to his back was within a planar range; if he could rise into the air, he could exceed the plane, so in mid-air when turning his body, he should be able to see the opponent's movements.

"Good!" The opponent also cheered.

The person appeared; exactly as Tsurumi had expected, the opponent had jumped past him, following behind, and indeed had not anticipated his splendid performance of the headstand. But something was also truly peculiar; the person had indeed appeared in front of Tsurumi, but the person with two small braids hanging from their head was not just one! It seemed like more than two... three, four... anyway, more than one.

Speaking like this, if it wasn't that Tsurumi's headstand had made his eyes blurred, like the situation after being drunk, unable to see clearly, then this lady must be a demon reincarnated, using a magical technique of creating clones.

Little does anyone know, this set of skills is a minor matter in our Chinese martial arts, not something to be surprised at. This is the footwork of the "Bagua" school in national martial arts. Master Sun Lutang once publicly performed it under the watchful eyes of many in Shanghai. Those who have seen it must still remember. His performance was divided into two styles: one, on a square-foot-sized ground, he could perform various nimble and transformative footwork, either advancing or retreating, only on the square foot of ground. Second, in an empty space of one zhang square, he would spread out the Bagua steps, able to make the audience's eyes dizzy and create several figures. However, Master Sun Lutang's specialty was not the "Bagua" school.

There's no way to talk about these things now. Back then, only a little over a decade ago, at the Temple of Agriculture in Beijing, there were often two experts from the "Bagua" school, practicing there before and after sunrise. Those who had seen them were probably countless. One was Zhang Zichang, Fourth Master Zhang, an old man in his sixties. He was small in stature but full of vigor, agile, and practiced for more than an hour every day.

Watching him walk the Bagua steps, he didn't seem fast, but if you were to boldly try to exchange blows with him, either his figure would disappear in an instant, or his figures would be all around you, shaking around you; it was as if one person had transformed into several. He was the direct descendant of the "Bagua" school, and also the teacher of these sisters.

### "Sun and Moon Shine Together" Overture

— Wang Jinshan

Dedicated to the Image of Martyr Chen Yingshi

Society is originally an ancient stage,

Since its opening, it has been performing until now.

How many heroes and heroines, sages and wise men,

How many demons and monsters, mountains and seas, strange and eternal;

And those people who are ignorant and foolish,

Everyone is busy going on stage and off stage.

Occasionally, someone doesn't want to think like the majority,

At that time, they will be ridiculed by everyone, saying that they are crazy.

At that time, they will be ridiculed by everyone, saying that they are crazy,

Occasionally, someone doesn't want to think like the majority.

Those who are enlightened and aware are not agreeable to the vulgar,

They push away wealth and despise profit,

They are not tempted by gain or afraid of threats;

Only for the masses, they pursue happiness.

"Supporting the weak and holding the precarious" is their career,

"Achieving benevolence and exhausting righteousness" is their destiny.

Their bright eyes shimmer with distant light,

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are contained within their grand chests,

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are contained within their grand chests,

Their bright eyes shimmer with distant light,

Dedicate everything of the individual to the nation,

They alone support the collapsing mansion;

Betting their lives for the survival of the masses,

Watering the flowers of freedom and equality with hot blood,

Using their heads to pave the way for a democratic China.

Although they lost the last move before their death,

Not being able to personally kill the treacherous officials became an eternal regret,

But their will is to be completed after their death.

But their will is to be completed after their death,

Not being able to personally kill the treacherous officials became an eternal regret.

History has always been a rugged road,

Twisting and turning towards endless eternity.

Banks collapse and cliffs break, jackals will gallop in the world,

Innocent lambs will also be offered to the hungry kisses of venomous beasts;

Satan will drag the fate of the masses to hell,

Saviors will rely on a spirit of perseverance—

Standing on the edge of broken banks and cliffs, raising their arms and shouting, shaking heaven and earth,

Turning the gears of the era, awakening the sleeping people.

Turning the gears of the era, awakening the sleeping people,

Standing on the edge of broken banks and cliffs, raising their arms and shouting, shaking heaven and earth.

They themselves are willing to be a bridge of transition,

Reversing the dangerous calamity, guiding the masses back to the road of prosperity;

When the roller of history passes over the bridge they built,

They have quietly passed away, but still live in the hearts of the people.

Like a blazing torch rising in the dark wilderness,

The light illuminates heaven and earth, and no one laughs at their madness anymore.

It is a great mind, great love, great hatred,

Great passion, constituting a great and sublime sacrifice!

Great passion, collectively constituting a great and sublime sacrifice

It is truly a great heart, great love, great hatred!

In "Revelation" there are these words:

—He loved us, with his own blood,

Delivered us from sin and turned us to light,

And made us a free nation.

He caught the devil and bound him tightly,

Sealed him in the bottomless pit for a thousand years. —

Look! Everyone's eyes will see that righteousness will last forever,

Even his enemies will see his radiant soul.

Even his enemies will see his radiant soul,

Look! Everyone's eyes will see that righteousness will endure.

He wears a thorny crown,

He wears clothes stained with blood,

He leads the masses into a new world,

Because the previous world has perished.

The masses will be saved and resurrected from this,

Solemn wisdom, holy radiance,

Like the sun, the moon, and the stars in the sky.

Displaying the truth, illuminating the joyful celebration,

Guiding humanity to happiness, freedom, and equality!

Guiding humanity to happiness, freedom, and equality,

Displaying the truth, illuminating the joyful celebration!

For thirty years, the people of the ancient country are still so foolish,

Gasping on the starvation line, living is a kind of torment;

Listen! The lightning and thunder of the long night are the wrath of God,

The storm of wind and rain in the sky is already foreshadowing the demise of humanity,

Knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it, let us bear the cross!

Those who hinder the survival of others will not continue to survive,

We must be worthy of the martyrs and also worthy of our descendants,

Whoever does not cherish peace will be condemned by history.

Whoever does not cherish peace will be condemned by history,

We must be worthy of the martyrs and also worthy of our descendants.

### Days Without News

— Ji Gan

A Western saying goes, "There is nothing new under the sun." According to this, there should be no news in the world. However, God created all things, and among these things, there will be activities outside of God's plan. This creates all kinds of strange and new things. The dazzling giant python luring Eve to pluck and eat the fruit of life is news, Eve persuading Adam is also news, and as a result, God angrily drove the couple out of the Garden of Eden, which was especially headline news that shook the universe.

However, any news, after a certain period, will naturally become old news. When God created birds, beasts, and the spiritual beings of mankind, he certainly hoped that they would live together harmoniously and get along well. At this time, suddenly a dog took a bite and bit a spiritual being. Not only did the beasts find this strange, but perhaps even the master of creation was surprised. If there had been newspapers at that time, it would definitely have become sensational news. But as time went on, the number of dog bites increased, and people gradually stopped treating it as news. Thus, some people thought that only humans biting dogs could be considered news.

But later, things like humans biting dogs happened again and again, just like dogs biting people. No one found it strange anymore, because even stranger things were constantly happening. Since the first dog bite, the newsworthiness of various news stories on this earth has climbed through tens of millions of stages. After World War II, newsworthiness has entered a state of rapid development. The things we are accustomed to now would make the ancients stare in amazement. Even if the Pacific Ocean suddenly dried up and the peaks of the Himalayas suddenly flew to the Arctic, it would not make them feel any stranger.

The ancients might say that we are numb, but we would say that they are easily startled. However, when the development of newsworthiness accelerates and exceeds our nervous system's ability to adapt, even the most numb people will be shocked and terrified, living in fear every day. At this time, we cannot help but think of another Western saying, "No news is good news," and pray for a day without news, because that is the news that has not yet happened.

— On the Atomic Bomb

The world is walking at the crossroads of the United Nations and the atomic bomb. The two are incompatible. If humanity chooses the atomic bomb, it will have to put aside the "United Nations"; if it chooses the United Nations, well, the mental threat of the atomic bomb must first be eliminated. Otherwise, the imagined atomic bomb defense line is likely to lead to a third world war.

Einstein, hailed as the "father of the atomic age," once said angrily:

"We must arouse the attention of the public and make them understand the actual situation created by the atomic bomb. Only international action to prevent war can save us, because then there will be no need to prepare for war, or even the possibility of preparing for war."

This means that a great scientist who can see the profound meaning of science believes that the only way to save mankind from the scourge of war is "international action."

Yes, even today we can still hear various reports about the atomic bomb. Some say that the plants near Nagasaki have shown genetic mutations, and that part of the new leaves are white. From this, it can be seen that its impact on human sperm must be significant. Others say that a fire recently broke out at the University of Washington in Seattle, and some firefighters rescued fish buckets containing fish caught from the Bikini Sea. After carefully examining the bodies of those firefighters, it was discovered that they had been exposed to mild radiation.

Recently, the newspapers also reported that some British workers were suffering from "atomic disease." The fact is that rumors are rife among workers at the state-owned secret atomic research station in northern England that they have lost their sexual ability, supposedly due to the impact of atomic fission. This result of sexual impotence has created a serious psychological terror within the workers' families. Perhaps there are no real atomic disease patients, and it is just a matter of self-disturbance. Due to mutual intimidation, Britain may add several mental patients who tremble at the mention of the atomic bomb and sweat profusely when talking about it. This is very possible.

Extensively publicizing the power of new weapons, if this is not a strategic tactic, then it should be due to curiosity. Reports about "the aftermath of the atomic bomb," "atomic disease," and so on, seem to be viewed in this way. If Einstein is right, then we should also take responsibility for preventing any reports that exaggerate the power of the atomic bomb, causing people to have a misconception that the "atomic bomb is omnipotent," or even causing a third world war because of this misconception. —Let people be liberated from the great terror of the atomic bomb, and let the people after the war listen to a Beethoven symphony, which is much more valuable and poetic than "atomic, atomic" all day long.

Letting the world create a large number of neurasthenia patients in the rumors of the atomic bomb, wouldn't this make the Japanese people who died under the atomic bomb snicker? —They are laughing because they just took a step earlier.

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York, Americans spend approximately $1 trillion annually on gambling, which is five times the cost of manufacturing the atomic bomb. If this news is not a misrepresentation, I hope that those who excessively publicize the power of the atomic bomb can wake up. Even in the United States, putting the atomic bomb and roulette gambling equipment on the scales, the latter is probably still heavier.

### Color and Psychology

— Bai Gao

Once, a scientist in London invited six friends to a feast at his home. After taking their seats, the dishes were served one after another, very exquisite, and the guests were very happy and had a great appetite. After a few minutes, the color of the lights changed. At first, everyone didn't pay attention. After a few minutes, two guests felt nauseous and couldn't help but vomit. The rest of the people also lost their appetite and got up from their seats. It turned out that the watercress on the table (like raw green onions often found on Chinese tables) turned bright pink, the beef turned greyish-white, the milk turned black, the lettuce turned a terrifying blue, the broad beans turned black, and the peanuts turned crimson. All the food changed from its original color and appearance. It turned out that the guests were the host's experimental subjects. The lights used a spectrum filter to filter out various colors in the spectrum, leaving only red and green. The scientist used this experiment to prove that color has a considerable influence on people's psychology and physiology. Poor guests were innocently subjected to his manipulation.

Color also has a great influence on the life and growth of plants. For example, the seeds of a certain plant need to be exposed to sunlight for ten days before they germinate, but if they are placed under blue glass, they can germinate in two days.

There is a black bridge near London. For many years, there had been a continuous stream of suicides jumping off the bridge. Later, someone suggested repainting the bridge green, and sure enough, the number of suicides was reduced by half. According to some people who study psychology, "The reason for the reduction in suicides is not because green has any effect that can make people happy and forget death, but because it eliminates the melancholic effect of black."

The color of the rooms in the hospital is closely related to the psychology of the patients. Light green in the operating room has a considerable good effect on doctors and nurses.

In courtrooms where criminals are interrogated, shining green light on the prisoners makes it easier to obtain truthful confessions.

Some people experience dizziness and motion sickness on airplanes and ships. It is said that painting the interior blue or green can reduce these effects. The most taboo color is yellow.

Other things, such as the colors of merchandise, must also cater to the psychology of customers.

### Noble Charity

— You Jin

Italian film star Isa Miranda became famous in the film industry for her most beautiful and flirtatious eyes. It is unknown how many admirers of her have had their souls captivated by these wonderful eyes.

"A clever smile with bright eyes," the beauty of a beautiful woman indeed lies in this pair of eyes. Normally, this kind of beautiful gaze can only be secretly sent and quietly flown during life. Although a single send and a single fly contain great charm, enough to subvert sentient beings, when life is over and the eyes are closed, its power should also disappear. However, this is not the case. According to a Paris dispatch from the Associated Press on the ninth of this month, Miranda has signed a contract with a certain great medical scientist to donate her most beautiful eyes in the world to science after her death. She is currently filming a French film in Paris. She said that the contract stipulates that after her death, her beautiful and charming brown eyes will be transplanted by doctors into the eye sockets of other blind people.

Although this is a matter after her death, it can be said to be her greatest and noblest act of charity for herself.

A Western philosopher said: "A person comes into this world not to take something away, but to give something to others." If there are no achievements in career and scholarship left for posterity, then generously donate everything you have on your body. This is the noblest act of charity. Compared to "a leopard leaving its skin after death," it is a more meaningful act of charity, because a leopard's leaving its skin is not an automatic signing of a contract.

This Miss Isa Miranda's reservation is truly a wise plan.

In Buddhism, giving up one's body on the Precipice of Self-Sacrifice to save starving animals is said to be an unparalleled act of merit. Miss Isa Miranda's donating her eyes to the blind can also be viewed in this way. Because this is truly the last so-called "glance of longing before leaving."

But I don't know if, when transferred to other people's bodies, they can still captivate souls and subvert sentient beings?

### "Great Autumn Leaf"

— Feng Qiuping

One of the New Styles of Crochet

The Great Autumn Leaf flower is a newly invented style that cannot be found in previous crocheting books. Its method of tying is mysterious, unique, and different from others. We use two colors, matched and tied together, to make it even more obvious. Other types of woolen garments start from the hem, while the "Great Autumn Leaf" starts from the collar and can be made into long or short garments as desired. The collar and shoulder yoke, the front and back of the body, are all connected together. When crocheting to five inches long in front of the chest, the tips of the autumn leaves are gathered. Below this, mainly plain knitting is used. Now we will publish the "Great Autumn Leaf" pattern in this newspaper for the reference of sisters who love crocheting. Everyone can crochet one piece, a "Great Autumn Leaf" spring outfit for 1947.

### How to Watch an Orchestral Conductor?

— Sheng He

The conductor occupies a noble leading position in the orchestra. He not only has to express the content of the music correctly and completely, but also has to explore the soul of the music with rich understanding and refined skills in order to achieve a good performance effect.

The most important conditions for conducting technique are: clarity, agility, strength, the ability to control every player and make him a machine of the conductor, and the ability to distinguish the sound of each instrument and correct errors at any time with excellent hearing. Only clumsy conductors flaunt their skills too much, waving their batons randomly, making the audience dizzy and chaotic.

The success of two world-renowned conductors, Toscanini (A. Toscanini) and Stokowski (L. Stokowski), lies in the fact that they are conducting masters who meet the above conditions and are good at understanding creative power. But the most amazing conductor in music history was Mozart. This "music prodigy" composer had a pair of uniquely gifted ears that helped him succeed. Therefore, when he conducted, the players were especially careful and attentive, so nervous that they did not dare to relax a little, because even the slightest incorrect sound from each instrument could not escape his ears.

Orchestral conducting is more difficult and challenging than any other type of conducting. The large number of instruments and performers force him to devote all his energy to the task. To conduct an orchestral performance, one must use the whole body and use various postures to imply the expressions that the players should display. Therefore, people often regard the conductor as a wizard who uses various magical techniques, passing through the use of the baton and hands, to lead out a string of wonderful and moving music.

Here, I will briefly tell music lovers some very common knowledge about watching an orchestral conductor:

(1) Pay attention to whether the conductor's movements and postures are clear, powerful, agile, and beautiful, and whether they match the music appropriately.

(2) To understand whether the conductor can understand and express the spirit of the music, just listen to whether the music that is played is plain and unremarkable, without any appeal, or moving and touching, captivating the audience.

(3) Pay attention to whether the conductor can control the entire orchestra, from the stringed instruments in the front to the percussion instruments in the back.

(4) Pay attention to the gestures and special methods the conductor uses to suggest expression.

(5) In addition to watching the conductor's skills, the audience themselves also needs to have some knowledge of conducting methods, such as the conducting method for four beats, where the first beat goes from top to bottom, the second beat from right to left, the third beat from left to right, and the fourth beat goes diagonally upward from the right to the starting point; the conducting method for three beats forms a triangle, and so on.

(6) Often compare the situations of several different conductors performing the same piece of music. Judge the merits of their conducting skills based on the impressions and sounds you get.
