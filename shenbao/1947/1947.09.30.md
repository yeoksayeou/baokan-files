### National Army in Jiaodong Searches Mountain Areas, Recovers Baishui and Wendai in Shaanxi and Henan; Remnant Bandits Crossing Longhai Railway Continue to Flee

[Report from this newspaper in the county on the 29th] The focus of the Jiaodong war is still developing in the Juchiya Mountain area, 20 kilometers southeast of Qixia. After the National Army recovered the key points at the foot of the mountain, Tangjiabo, Liujiagou, and Shandongtou, they are now advancing fiercely towards the heart of the area in separate routes. In addition, two other attacking units of the National Army are currently continuing to advance from Qixia towards Yantai and from Huangxian towards Penglai. The resistance encountered by these two routes is minimal. The main purpose of the National Army is to discover landmines buried by the Communist bandits along the way and remove other obstacles. Therefore, the progress has not been as rapid as generally imagined.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] The National Army in Qixia, Jiaodong, is currently conducting a thorough search in the Juchiya Mountain area in the southeast, and has controlled all the key passes. It is reported that there are numerous small-scale armories of the Communist bandits in the area, which is known as the Jiaodong ammunition supply base.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 29th] The National Army in Jiaodong is approaching the suburbs of Qishan City and is engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in its southwest area.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 29th] In the Henan-Hubei border area, the National Army advancing southward from Hengchuan defeated parts of the bandit's Second, Third, and Sixth Columns at Xiayagang (7 kilometers southeast of Chongchuan). The remnant bandits retreated to the east and west areas of Shuanglun River (15 kilometers southeast of Guangshan). The National Army is currently pursuing them victoriously.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 29th] The bandits who had been entrenched in Baishui County suffered heavy casualties after days of fierce attacks by the National Army. They were finally attacked by the National Army and entered the city on the evening of the 27th, and the remnant bandits fled in all directions to the suburbs.

[Another Dispatch] Our troops counterattacking along the railway from Tongguan launched an attack on the bandits with overwhelming force. The bandit army suffered heavy casualties and fled eastward in a panic. Our army recaptured Taodi Town on the afternoon of the 28th. In addition, the bandit army entrenched in Sanyaosi was also defeated and fled after our sweep. The commander of the bandit's 55th Division was killed in battle. Currently, there are no traces of bandits in the Weinan area. Detailed battle results are being investigated.

[Another Dispatch] A unit of the Communist 12th Brigade, consisting of more than 2,000 bandits entrenched south of Tongguan, has been wiped out after days of cleaning up, with more than half of them killed or wounded. The remaining troops were unable to hold out and have been fleeing towards Dayukou (south of Gedizhen) since the 27th. We are pursuing them closely.

[Report from this newspaper, Kaifeng, 28th] Bandits from Yiyang and the ancient city of southern Shaanxi sneaked into the suburbs of Lushi last night, gathering more than 30,000 people, with unclear intentions.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 29th] The Communist bandits lurking in Yichuan and Dengfeng fled in separate groups. Currently, there are no traces of bandits in Yichuan and Dengfeng.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th] The Communist bandits who fled south across the Longhai Railway in western Shandong were divided into two groups on the morning of the 29th, one in the area southwest of Xiayi and the other between Qi County and Tongxu. A small number fled towards Taikang. Although these two groups of bandits have the numbers of four columns, their total number is only over 10,000, and they do not dare to make direct contact with the National Army. They only flee through gaps and disturb the local area, but they are suffering heavy losses due to the attacks of local militias everywhere.

[Report from this newspaper, Yanzhou, 29th] The main force of Chen Yi's remnant troops, consisting of eight columns, who had gathered in southwestern Shandong, with the exception of two columns that are still lingering in the central areas of Dingtao, Juye, Caoxian, and Shanxian counties, have all fled south across the Longhai Railway to the areas north of Yongcheng, Zhecheng, and Taikang. The National Army is pursuing them in separate routes.

[Report from this newspaper, Xuzhou, 29th] After the remnant bandits in western Shandong crossed the Longhai Railway, they continued to flee eastward towards Xikou (northwest of Suxian) and Wazikou (southwest of Xuzhou) on the afternoon of the 29th, with the intention of crossing the Jinpu Railway and fleeing to northern Jiangsu. The bandits are short of food and ammunition, and are deserting along the way.

[Report from this newspaper, Kaifeng, 28th] A unit of Chen Yi's troops, consisting of more than 2,000 people, arrived in the suburbs of Tongxu at 6:00 PM on the 28th and is engaged in fierce fighting with the local militia. Another unit of more than 2,000 people captured Weishi on the evening of the 28th and continued westward, arriving at Xindian, 45 li southeast of Kaifeng, at 7:00 PM. They are still moving westward in succession. Our city imposed a curfew in advance on the evening of the 26th. In addition, the First, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Eighty-Fourth Columns of bandits, totaling about twelve brigades, have all fled south across the Longhai Railway. More than 3,000 bandits in the southeast of the flooded area have arrived in the vicinity of Ningqiu and Xiangcheng. The National Army is preventing and blocking them.

### Pingbao Section Reopens to Traffic; Strengthened Joint Transportation Inside and Outside Shanhaiguan on the Beining Railway; Changshen Section of the China Changchun Railway Fully Connected

[Report from this newspaper, Baoding, 29th] The Pingbao section of the Pinghan Railway reopened to traffic on the 29th. Five hundred trucks each heading north from Baoding departed at 9:00 AM, and the train heading south from Ping arrived in Baoding at 5:00 PM in the afternoon, transporting a large amount of coal, and prices in Baoding have returned to normal. It is reported that the Hebei military and political authorities have prepared countermeasures to protect the railway, mobilizing villagers and local militias along the railway to jointly maintain it, and increasing the deployment of troops to garrison Gaobeidian and Baoding, patrolling and guarding day and night, in order to smash the bandits' attempts to sabotage the railway.

[Report from this newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Joint transportation inside and outside Shanhaiguan can now be strengthened. Xie Zhen, deputy director of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, recently arrived in Ping and reached an agreement with the Pingjin Railway Bureau to increase the number of direct military trains. In addition to the existing 301st and 302nd trains, two more direct express trains between Tianjin and Shenyang will be added. The 303rd and 304th trains will both be kept overnight in Jin County, and the existing 49th and 50th ordinary passenger trains that currently run between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan will be extended to Jinzhou and renamed as the 341st and 342nd trains, which can arrive on the same day.

[Report from this newspaper, Tianjin, 29th] In order to cut off traffic inside and outside Shanhaiguan, the Communist bandits have recently become more active in sabotaging the Beining Railway. On the evening of the 28th, a military train hit a mine near Chadian, causing four cars to overturn and being attacked by the Communist bandits, resulting in several hours of fierce fighting before the bandit army retreated.

[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, 29th] Chen Shungeng, director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, told reporters of this newspaper that he was summoned to Beijing by Minister Yu and has received the full support of the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry has agreed to allocate all the necessary funds and materials. The section from Yanzhou to Taian can be completed and open to traffic before the Double Ten Festival if there are no accidents. As for the Yanzhou-Jining line, due to the larger scale of some bridge projects, it will take longer, but it will definitely be open to traffic by the end of the year at the latest. As for the Jinzhang section of the Jiaoji Railway, due to difficulties in transporting materials, only road surface repairs can be carried out for the time being. It will be necessary to wait for the opening of the Yanzhou-Jining section of the Jinpu Railway before materials from outside can be transported. Therefore, it is estimated that the restoration time will be in March of next spring.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] The emergency repair project of the temporary railway bridge on the Dongliao River has been largely completed, and it is expected that a test run can be carried out within one or two days. The Changshen section is now fully connected.

[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 29th] The railway near Xingcheng between Jin and Ning on the Beining Railway was sabotaged by the Communist bandits. Passenger and freight trains heading west from Panxi only traveled to Jinxi on the 29th.

### China Has the Right to Demand Guarantees Against Future Japanese Aggression; American Newspaper Sympathizes with Our Position on the Japanese Peace Treaty

[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] The New York Herald Tribune published an article today calling on Americans to give greater consideration to China's position on the future Japanese peace treaty. The newspaper pointed out that the painful fact of Japanese aggression against China is a terrible experience in the minds of the Chinese people, and China has the most noble reasons to demand guarantees that it will not be harmed by Japan again. The title of the editorial is "China and Japan." The newspaper stated: "Until now, the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Japan has generally been given great importance, but the attitude of the United States towards China has not been considered." Although China's public statements have been quite cautious, its dissatisfaction with the US proposal (which would be agreed to by most of the relevant countries) is no less than that of the Soviet Union. The United States and China fear that the future peace treaty with Japan may allow Japan to immediately restore its industrial and military monopoly over East Asia. For this reason, China's unwillingness to accept any peace conference plan that does not include the veto power of a major power is the same as the Soviet Union's attitude. The newspaper also stated that China had originally proposed holding a preliminary peace treaty conference with the four powers of China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States first, which would give China and the Soviet Union a veto power (if the two countries took joint action). Currently, there seems to be a possibility that China will strengthen its position and demand that each major power (including itself, of course) enjoys a veto power. Members of the Resident Committee of the Chinese Political Council, in their report to the government, suggested the above policy, and they also suggested: Abolish the Japanese "Emperor system," Japan should maintain its minimum standard of living, the Ryukyu Islands and other islands overseas of China should be placed under Chinese trusteeship, and the Allied powers should control Japan for at least thirty years. Overall, the recommendations of the Resident Committee of the Political Council seem to be excessive, but from the terrible experience that Japanese aggression has inflicted on China, its recommendations are a natural result. When formulating a peace treaty with Japan, we should remember that China has the noblest reasons to demand guarantees that it will not be harmed by Japan again. On the surface, the attitude of the Japanese seems to have changed, but it is impossible to determine what the actual situation is behind the surface. China has reason to demand guarantees for future security, which are not the empty words of some American officials that "the Japanese will become a peaceful people within a few generations."

### Chairman of Suiyuan Sells Horses to Relieve Disaster Victims in Yimeng

[Report from this newspaper, Gui Sui, 28th]

Suiyuan Chairman Dong Qiwu considers the disaster situation in Yimeng to be serious, and the people are starving every day. He specially sold two of his personal steeds at a price to relieve the disaster. It is said that these two steeds had followed Dong in battles in the provinces of Shanxi and Suiyuan, participating in the War of Resistance against Japan and various campaigns to suppress the rebellion. They were very precious, and Dong usually cherished them very much.

### Song Ziwen Flies to Guangdong to Assume New Post; Luo Zhuoying Bids Farewell to the Guangzhou Press

[Report from this newspaper] The newly appointed Chairman of Guangdong Province, Song Ziwen, is scheduled to take a plane from Shanghai to Guangzhou at 11:00 AM today to assume office. It is said that the personnel of the Guangdong Provincial Government will not be changed for the time being. Song will go to Beijing to report on his work in two weeks.

[Report from this newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] Chairman Luo Zhuoying recently held a cocktail party to bid farewell to reporters. He said: During his two years in charge of Guangdong, all facilities have not achieved the expected results. In the past, governance focused on public security, food, and transportation. However, due to continuous disasters and poor harvests, the food problem has not been fundamentally resolved, and food shortages cannot be avoided. Industrial construction, if there is no concrete plan, cannot guide tourism and absorb foreign exchange. Therefore, a five-year construction plan was specially drawn up last autumn to strive to develop the economy, stabilize society, and then seek to popularize education and clarify politics. Other projects such as water conservancy projects have also been implemented one after another. However, due to the banditry that has not been cleared, financial fluctuations, and successive floods, the suffering of the people cannot be alleviated, which is really regrettable. Luo finally said: "The moon is bright in Zhuhai, and the white clouds are unharmed. How dare I say that I am leaving perfectly. However, I believe that two years have not been wasted. The country has many problems, and the future is still difficult. After I leave, I will still follow the righteousness of admiring my homeland and seek happiness for my compatriots." He also expressed his gratitude to the press for their assistance over the past two years, with infinite reluctance in his words.

### Supervisory Yuan's Talk Meeting Suggests Requesting Control of Sino-Korean Trade to Prevent a Crisis of Disguised Sino-Japanese Trade

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 29th]

The Supervisory Yuan held a talk meeting on the morning of the 29th. The attending supervisors included Wan Can, Wang Xinling, Li Xiaoting, Yu Shude, Wang Guanwu, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Shuhui, Ma Yaonan, Zhang Lu, Liu Tu, etc. The meeting decided to submit two proposals, one regarding the appointment of Song Ziwen as the head of Guangdong, and the other regarding the Sino-Korean trade case. The former was submitted to President Yu Youren for presentation to the National Government. The latter advocated strict control of Sino-Korean trade to avoid it becoming a disguised Sino-Japanese trade. After the attending supervisors signed their names, they will be transferred to be submitted. The original text of the suggestion on Sino-Korean trade passed by the Supervisory Yuan's talk meeting is as follows:

"For the matter of suggesting strict control of Sino-Korean trade to prevent the crisis of disguised Sino-Japanese trade, I humbly believe that recently Sino-Korean trade is about to open. China and South Korea are originally brotherly countries, and the independence and freedom of South Korea are even our country's established national policy. This is originally beneficial to both countries to promote true friendship and determine its early realization. However, Korea and Japan are neighboring countries. If Sino-Korean trade is not strictly controlled, then due to the current special circumstances, in the future, the materials that our country imports from South Korea may be transferred to Japan for use by Japan. At the same time, Japanese materials that our country does not need, which are enough to harm our national industry and national economy, may also be transferred into the country from South Korea. This should be revised and strictly controlled in advance by the departments in charge, paying attention to each other's needs on the one hand, and identifying the original place of production and the final place of sale of the materials, so as to prevent problems before they occur."

### Central Standing Committee Ad Hoc Meeting Passes Party-League Supervision Organization Case; Candidates for Chairmen of Party Departments in Various Provinces and Cities Also Decided

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The candidates for the chairmen of the party departments in various provinces and cities after the unified organization of the Party and the League were approved at the ad hoc meeting of the Central Standing Committee on the 29th. However, since the personnel of the two cities in the northeast province have not all been determined, the announcement has been postponed. The regular meeting today was presided over by Fan Yusu.

The Central Supervisory Committee will add one Deputy Secretary-General. Each department of the Central Supervisory Committee will add one Deputy Director. The Zeng Supervisory Committee will set up a Standing Supervisory Committee, which will be organized by three supervisory members designated by the Central Supervisory Committee from the supervisory members of the unified organization.

If the Party has supervisory members but the League does not have supervisory members, or the League has supervisory members but the Party does not have supervisory members, the Central Supervisory Committee will re-appoint seven to nine people as supervisory members and designate three people as standing members. The Provincial Supervisory Committee will add one secretary. The Provincial Supervisory Committee will reorganize the existing staff of the Party and the League to handle affairs. The county-level supervisory committee will be organized by the existing Party-League supervisory members and supervisors.

### National Land Administration Review Conference Opens; Chairman Chiang Issues Instructions; Recognize Facts and Implement Policies Accurately

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The National Land Administration Review Conference was held in the morning of the 29th at the Lixing Society Auditorium in Nanjing. More than a hundred representatives attended, including Vice President Wang Yun-wu, Minister Zhang Lisheng, Commissioner Xiao Zheng, and representatives from various provinces. Minister Li Jingzhai presided over the ceremony and delivered the opening speech, stating briefly: Post-war land issues in our country are extremely important. During the war, land registration across the country had undergone prolonged changes and urgently needed to be cleared up. The main mission of this conference is to use scientific methods to review changes in land ownership and land rights during the war and the recovery situation in the past two years after the war, to implement land policies, strengthen land production, and achieve the ideal of "land to the tiller." Subsequently, Chen Zheng, the chief secretary of the Ministry of Land Administration, read aloud Chairman Chiang's instructions to the conference (see below). Vice President Wang then gave two points of instructions: Local autonomy is the foundation for implementing constitutional government, and land registration is the main task of local autonomy. This conference should thoroughly review the current situation of land administration implementation and formulate phased and regional steps. Land administration work should be coordinated with government policies and the work of relevant agencies, assisting each other to promote progress, to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Commissioner Xiao Zheng then delivered a speech stating that the economic reform plan aims to expand production, increase national income, and balance the national budget, and it is planned to establish a land bank and issue land bonds to revitalize finance, fully utilize land, and increase agricultural production and "land to the tiller" are established government policies, hoping the conference will pay attention to this point. After Xiao's speech, Zhu Ping, the director of the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau, delivered a reply on behalf of the attendees, and the ceremony was adjourned. A preparatory meeting and the first official session were held at 3:00 PM.

Chairman Chiang's instructions to the National Land Administration Review Conference are as follows:

Land is one of the three essential elements of production. Our country
is founded on agriculture, and most people rely on farming for a living.
Therefore, the distribution of land rights and the use of land resources
are the crux of all social problems.
Throughout history, the rise and fall of dynasties have been inextricably linked to this.
The Founding Father advocated revolution and first proposed equalizing
land ownership, with the aim of fundamentally solving the domestic
land problem and realizing the ideal of equal prosperity for all.
For the past twenty years, the government has followed his teachings
and formulated various land administration laws and regulations, hoping
to achieve the effects of a land revolution in daily administration.
However, due to insufficient enforcement and the difficulty in rapidly
changing traditional social customs, the continued effects have not been
fully realized, allowing the Communists to exploit the loopholes, using
land reform as an excuse to carry out their conspiracy of coercing
farmers and destroying rural organizations. There is no greater
cause for regret than this. We must deeply reflect, recognize the facts,
and ensure that land policies are implemented accurately. Only then
can the foundation of national construction be firmly established.
At present, mobilizing to suppress the rebellion and preparing for
constitutional government are progressing simultaneously. We must
promptly take effective measures to address the Communists'
perverse land reform actions, uniting rural people, improving farmers'
lives; and complete the basic work of local self-government,
truly training farmers to exercise their four rights, ensuring
the normal and sound development of farmers' political and economic
lives, thereby thoroughly defeating the Communists' conspiracy.

Our country's land administration agencies at all levels have already been
widely established. After the government accommodated the participation
of various parties, the Ministry of Land Administration was established
under the Executive Yuan to strengthen the promotion of land
administration. Today, as the National Land Administration Review
Conference opens, bringing together the heads of land administration
agencies from the central government and various regions, examining the
gains and losses of past work, and collectively seeking guidelines for
future efforts, the significance is extremely important. In particular,
most of the personnel come from pacification provinces, exploring the
true nature of problems through factual experience, and will surely
make valuable contributions.

However, land administration measures have two major goals: one is
to focus on curbing land speculation and eliminating unearned gains
for urban land use, using taxation based on assessed value and the
return of increased value to the public as means to achieve equality
in urban land ownership; the other is to focus on protecting tenant
farmers and supporting owner-cultivators for rural cultivated land, to
gradually achieve the goal of "land to the tiller," realizing equality
in rural land ownership. In recent years, the government's implementation
of land tax and the "25% rent reduction" are only preliminary steps
towards these two major goals. If these can be promoted thoroughly
and progressively, our country's land problem will surely be solved
soon. In particular, land administration in the pacification areas must
be based on established policies, strictly adhere to current laws and
regulations, uphold firm beliefs, seek technical support, overcome
difficulties, and faithfully implement them, so as to curb the current
turmoil and establish a foundation for revival. I deeply hope that all
comrades will contribute their knowledge, humbly review, and fully
promote land administration work, so that the revolutionary mission
can be accomplished. Great expectations are placed upon you.

### Kuomintang Central Memorial Week; Yu Feipeng Reports on Grain Administration; Preparing for Improvement of Military, Public, and Civilian Grain Storage and Transportation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Kuomintang Central Party
Headquarters held the weekly Memorial Ceremony to Dr. Sun Yat-sen
at 9:00 AM on the 29th in the main hall of the headquarters.
Chairman Zhang Ji led the ceremony, followed by a report by
Minister of Food Yu Feipeng on the planning and improvement of
grain administration work for the 36th year of the Republic.
Yu began by describing the planning situation for military, public,
and civilian grain, stating: This year's military grain figures are
based on the standard number of troops, and it is hoped that the
units will be able to issue them accurately in the future to avoid
feeling insufficient. For public grain, distribution to public
employees in Nanjing and Shanghai has already begun this spring,
requiring 300,000 dan per month, including a small amount of civilian
grain. It has also been implemented in Tianjin and Peiping since
September, requiring 150,000 bags of flour per month. If the
situation permits in the future, the scope of distribution will be
gradually expanded. For civilian food, the Purchasing and Storage
Committee of the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration
(UNRRA) plans to purchase 5 million dan of wheat and 10 million dan of
rice this year. It has already purchased 3 million dan of wheat, and
the purchase of rice is entrusted to the Farmers Bank of China, which
has also purchased 5 million dan, all of which will be used to regulate
civilian prices. At the same time, UNRRA plans to use 200,000 tons
of grain to provide relief to civilians along the coast of our country,
but our country must also allocate a corresponding amount. Our
country has already agreed to this plan. Yu then reported on the
improvements in grain administration work, divided into collection,
warehousing, transportation, and allocation, explaining each in detail.
He stated: In terms of collection, it is planned that in areas with
inconvenient transportation, the public can pay grain taxes in legal
tender as much as possible. Then the collection agency can use this
fund to purchase from grain-producing areas, avoiding the various
difficulties of transportation for the public. At the same time,
collective grain payment can also bring many conveniences to the
public. The current warehouses in various places are not perfect, and
the ministry plans to actively build warehouses. In all grain-producing
areas, it will try to build larger-scale warehouses and improve them.
As for transportation, the ministry will pay attention to the weather
at all times and carry out transportation work during the agricultural
slack season. When mentioning the accumulated malpractices in grain
administration, Yu expressed that in the future, careful selection
of personnel and strengthened supervision can avoid the occurrence of
fraud. Once illegal activities are discovered, they will be severely dealt
with.

### The Same Mid-Autumn Festival, Different North and South

Hangzhou

Many Tourists at Night

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] Today is the Mid-Autumn
Festival, and prices in Hangzhou have been rapidly rising
despite the "big price reduction" campaigns. However, the business
of mooncake shops such as Yixiangzhai is still booming, with supply
falling short of demand. Due to the recent large number of tourists,
the boatmen of West Lake have raised their prices. Although it is
cloudy tonight, there are still many people touring the lake at night,
and the boat price has risen to 50,000 yuan per hour. Meanwhile, the
labor-management dispute at the First Cotton Mill has not been completely
resolved, and a strike by tricycle drivers has broken out again, indicating
that society is still in a state of flux and unrest. In addition,
Mayor Jian Xiangxian of Hangzhou personally visited various military
institutions today to express his appreciation.

Wuxi

Refugees Adorn the Streets

[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 29th] Today is cloudy and cool. Banks and
money shops are closed in the afternoon, and citizens happily
celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. Vegetable prices have temporarily
skyrocketed, and flour has also soared. Soybean oil is nearly 1.2
million, and rice and grain prices cannot be suppressed due to the
Ministry's order. There are refugees from Jiangsu and Anhui begging
on the streets, more than tourists, which is a "decoration" for the
Mid-Autumn Festival.

seen this summer. Today, citizens are sweating through the Mid-Autumn
Festival. The prices of general food items in the market have risen,
and the mooncake market is extremely prosperous. Last night and
tonight, the breeze is clear and the moon is bright, and the West
Lake is crowded with tourists, happily spending the beautiful evening.

Guangzhou

Dull Financial Market

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th] Banks in Guangzhou are closed
for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and trading in the financial market is
dull. The market price of Hong Kong dollars is between 9,000 and 9,100.

Changchun

Not Much Holiday Spirit

[This Newspaper, Changchun, 29th] Today is the Mid-Autumn
Festival, and shops and some agencies are closed as usual.
Mooncakes cost 6,000 circulating notes per catty. Generally speaking,

### Two Major Fires in Nanchang

[This Newspaper, Nanchang, 29th] After a long period without rain,
the god of wind is wreaking havoc. Two major fires broke out in
Nanchang during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The fire at Gaoqiao
market burned from 3:00 AM until late at night, and the flames
were not completely extinguished. The fire spread from the Gaoqiao
small commodities market eastward to Guohuo Road, Gaoqiao Primary
School, Bridal Street, westward to Taosha Pond, Zhushi Street,
southward to Kuaizi Lane, and northward to the intersection of
Xiangshan Road and Zhongshan Road. 790 households were affected.
At 2:00 PM, another fire broke out in the thatched sheds at the
Zhongzheng Bridgehead in the Niuhang Railway Station area, destroying
600 households. The people affected by the two fires urgently need
relief, numbering over 10,000. The Jiangxi Branch of the Relief
Administration and the municipal government are planning relief efforts.

### Executive Yuan Retains Huo Baoshu; Zheng Daoru Denies Being Appointed Acting Director-General; Li Zhuomin Can Be Reinstated If There Is No Criminal Evidence

[This Newspaper Report] Huo Baoshu, Director-General of the
Relief Administration, previously requested resignation from the Central
Government due to illness. The authorities of the Executive Yuan
formally replied yesterday, disapproving the request and expressing
their retention. According to sources close to Director-General Huo
who spoke to reporters, Huo is actually overwhelmed by official
duties and physically unable to continue, and will request resignation
again, with a very firm intention.

[Further Report] Zheng Daoru, Deputy Director-General of the
Relief Administration, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 27th,
went to the office yesterday to handle official business, and returned
to Nanjing in the evening to attend this morning's Executive Yuan
meeting. He told reporters yesterday that his visit was purely to
handle official business and denied "acting as Director-General."

According to Zheng, as far as he knows, Director-General Huo's
request for resignation was purely due to being overwhelmed by official
duties and illness. The external rumors that it was due to the
impeachment by the Control Yuan are absolutely untrue. The
Executive Yuan has now formally retained him. Regarding Deputy
Director-General Li Zhuomin, the Executive Yuan has imposed a suspension,
not "removal" or "dismissal." According to the regulations, after a
suspension, he can be reinstated if the Judicial Yuan's investigation
finds no criminal evidence. Therefore, there is currently no successor
to Li. Li's salary has now been suspended, but if he is reinstated,
it will be paid retroactively.

### Ministry of Food Re-Approves Qingdao's External Purchase of Grain

### Who Would Want to Be a Dancer Unless Pressured by Circumstances? Thousands of Guangzhou Dancers Gather to Appeal for Postponement of the Dance Ban; Wang Xiaoying Agrees to Request on Their Behalf from the Government

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] All the dancers and dance industry
workers in the city recently held a meeting to discuss requesting the
municipal government to postpone the implementation of the dance ban.
Nearly a thousand people attended, and the dancers were all lightly made
up and had worried expressions. The dancers who spoke included Li Lili,
Qu Ziyan, Cao Liying, Zhu Meili, Huang Pingting, and others, all of
whom said: Who would want to be a dancer unless pressured by
circumstances? They hoped that people in society would sympathize with
them and called on the government to postpone the dance ban to avoid
directly or indirectly affecting more than 5,000 people, whose livelihoods
would have no way to be solved. Their voices were tearful, moving the
entire audience. Legislative Member Wang Xiaoying, attending the
meeting as the person in charge of the Guangdong Women's Occupational
Promotion Association, spoke, saying that dancing is a noble form of
entertainment, but under the general mobilization order, soldiers at
the front are killing enemies, and people in the rear should live
frugally. Therefore, the dance ban is imperative. The current problem
is the relief measures after the dance ban. She is willing to request
from the government, under the condition that it does not conflict
with the laws and regulations, to postpone the implementation of the
dance ban. The dancers all expressed their gratitude. It is heard
that the Municipal Government is considering this issue and may postpone
the implementation for several months.

### Press Conference in Warsaw (Continued)

A temporary translator translates important news and opinions
for me every day. During these few days in Poland, three major
news items covered all the pages: the purge of the Socialist Party,
the "foolish" Paris Conference, and the Chinese Civil War and
Wedemeyer's visit to China. Except for the Poland Peasant Party's
organ, the "Lok Duvar" newspaper publishing Reuters, Associated Press,
United Press's Chinese war news, the rest were all publishing
the same TASS news.

Many Polish intellectuals are now closely concerned about the
situation in China. They are not interested in China's internal
affairs, but are wary that the chaos in China may trigger another
major catastrophe for humanity.

There are currently two cities in Europe that are frantically
discussing war: one is Berlin, and the other is Warsaw. Germans talk
about war, using the future war to comfort themselves. They dream
that Germany might be resurrected in the next great war. Poles talk
about war, but with a kind of excitement. Excitement can be seen in
two ways. One emotion is the desire to use war to break open the
gloomy situation, and the other emotion is the fear that when the
Third World War comes, they will suffer unimaginable hardships.

Overseas Anecdotes

There is a Warsaw city
matter that I should
mention:

A Polish-American scientist,
participated in the research work
of the atomic bomb in the United States.
One day, to visit relatives,
suddenly returned to Warsaw, many Bielan friends
surrounded him to talk about "overseas anecdotes,"
Finally, he talked about the atomic bomb.

The scientist boasted about the power of the American atomic
bomb: "The Hiroshima bomb,
650,000 people died. The future war,
is the atomic bomb war!"

A Warsaw friend asked: "If a
city as big as London, how many
atomic bombs would it take to destroy it?"

The scientist pondered for a while, picked up a pencil,
and gradually calculated from the distribution of land
population, industrial
equipment, and so on. Finally calculated
the result: "It takes about four atomic
bombs!"

The young man asked again: "Then, like
such a large country as France, how many
atomic bombs would be needed to
completely destroy its major cities,
major industries, and transportation lifelines?"

The scientist spent a lot of effort and calculated for a long time.
for a long time, saying: "It takes at least fourteen atomic
bombs, to make France unable to lift
its head!"

"Then how many atomic bombs
would it take to destroy a
larger country like Soviet Russia?"

The scientist said without hesitation: "One
hundred and seventy-eight bombs!"

This story is circulating in Warsaw, very
universally. In fact, what I have
heard in Europe is not just in Warsaw.
However, Poles are particularly sensitive and particularly like
to spread the story, and tell it vividly.

Rumors are creating fear in Poland, and
Poles, who are as smart as the French, are
becoming more and more aware that they are
a "tragedy."
Behind the "Iron Curtain", they are not like
other Slavs, who believe in their
"leader" as invincible.

Red Outside, White Inside

In terms of post-war geography, Poland
is the vanguard of the Iron Curtain. They
are easy to contact with the UK and the US, easy
to understand. From a cultural point of view, Poles
have always been a powerful seed
of Western European culture, especially a faithful
practitioner of French culture.

In Warsaw, almost every Pole
can speak French. The more proficient in French,
the more exalted his social status. In the Louis
era, the French court etiquette
, is no longer seen in Paris, but
is deeply rooted in Poland, in the so-called high
society. No European
country's men would kiss
female guests' hands so seriously. Even in the poorest Polish
homes, you can't ignore those
etiquettes.

Before the war, Polish primary and secondary schools
taught French. This is the Polish Ministry of Education
required foreign language. Now, public
schools are teaching Russian. Private
"English night schools" are all the rage. Family
tutors charge 500 "paper"
(Polish currency name) per hour to teach English, teaching
French only costs two hundred.

German is also unusually common in Poland,
which is the result of five years of conquest.
In the minds of Poles, in terms of culture,
they look down on Russia and respect
Western European countries. Because Germany
is its enemy, the environment created the need for them to
court France. After the First World War,
France was a
strong supporter of the Polish restoration movement.

Marshal Siemierski, the Minister of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, who currently holds the military lifeline of Poland,
is a standard "French"
character. He used to study at the French military school,
and later participated in the restoration movement led by
General Piłsudski.
In the later period of General Piłsudski's regime, he was close to
Nazi fascism. Siemierski
went into seclusion and returned to France.
During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Siemierski
travelled between France and Poland, doing "underground
movements," and later made contact with the Soviet Russian side.

Now, entering and exiting the Polish Ministry of National Defense
are all Russian
military advisers wearing red star hats. Some people also say: There are
many plainclothes disguised Russians
working. However, the Bielan people still believe
that Siemierski himself is "red outside,
white inside," meaning that his
duty requires him to deal with the Russians, but
his heart is completely "un-Red."

I didn't visit the Ministry of National Defense, and I
don't know if these are true or false. Foreign journalists
often ask many bizarre rumors
, to General Grotocz. Once,
I don't know which reporter said: "It's recently been rumored in the city of Warsaw
that the Soviet Russia is also going to convene a
conference, to confront the Paris Conference. Is this
true or false?" General Grotocz
very cleverly replied: "Tell you,
there is one city with the most rumors in Europe
, and this city is called Warsaw!" (At the Bristol Hotel)

Editorial

### Song Ziwen Flies to Guangdong to Take Office

Mr. Song Ziwen's appointment as Chairman of Guangdong Province was approved by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Meeting on the 19th of this month. He is scheduled to fly to Guangdong today to assume his new post. How Mr. Song will implement his new plans is presumably already well thought out. It is said that after spending about twenty days in Guangdong, Mr. Song will come to the capital city as a general. At that time, there may be some adjustments in the personnel of the Guangdong Provincial Government to facilitate the promotion of provincial governance reforms.

Mr. Song's current tenure in Guangdong comes approximately six months after he resigned from the position of President of the Executive Yuan. Given Mr. Song's past history in the Kuomintang, his experience in national politics, and his decisive and responsible work style, coupled with being at the prime of his career, it is only natural for him to return to the political stage.

However, what has particularly drawn the attention of Chinese and foreign individuals is why Mr. Song, having resigned from the prestigious position of President of the Executive Yuan (an appointed position), would willingly take on the lower-ranked position of Provincial Chairman (a simplified appointment). Little do they know that such notions of position and rank are definitely not what revolutionaries think. "To do great things, one does not need to be a high-ranking official" was a valuable teaching of the Father of the Nation, and Mr. Song is a devout follower. Moreover, Guangdong Province is Mr. Song's hometown, and it has suffered severe flooding, rampant smuggling, and the presence of bandits. With the central government placing great hope on him, how could a revolutionary entertain the idea of retirement? Mr. Song's ability to obey the government's orders, abandoning the superficial concept of "face" associated with position and rank, and dedicating himself to the place where the nation currently needs him most is truly setting a new trend in Chinese politics. Zhang, the President of the Executive Yuan, recently said "Talent should be applied to frontier regions." Mr. Song's current mission is truly the first shot in "Talent should be applied to frontier regions."

Guangdong is the cradle of the revolution, and Mr. Song is a person who has been personally taught by the revolutionary mentor. The current Guangdong, as Vice Chairman Sun stated, has regressed significantly compared to the era of the Northern Expedition. It needs someone with talent, courage, and the deep trust of the central government, like Mr. Song, to boldly and resolutely carry out a reform endeavor. When the Guangdong provincial personnel are adjusted in the future, we further hope that Mr. Song will be able to select first-class talents for Guangdong, taking into account local conditions and acting with impartiality, to jointly strive for the renewal of local politics.

In light of Mr. Song's governance of Guangdong, we would also like to take this opportunity to offer some suggestions to the central authorities: The constitution clearly stipulates the powers of the central and local governments as "balanced," with provinces becoming high-level local autonomous organizations. Therefore, the central authorities preparing to implement the constitution should change their past conceptions, enhance the powers of the provincial governments, and allow ambitious and talented chairmen to lead their cadres and strive for the overall goal of reforming local politics and relieving the suffering of the people. The central government should only supervise and evaluate, without interfering in everything, so that local officials are not rendered powerless despite having a title, and constantly fear making mistakes. Secondly, when discussing local politics, the separation of military and civilian affairs and the governance by civilians has become a well-worn and familiar phrase. However, the outside world has long rumored that the military chairmen of some provinces may be replaced, but the central government is still hesitating. This is certainly due to the turbulence of the situation and the careful selection of candidates, which is unavoidable. However, in provincial governments that are not in pacification areas, selecting civilian officials to govern, based on the principle of appointing the wise and talented, may well be a way to make a fresh start and refresh the people's perception.

### Convening of the National Land Administration Conference

The National Land Administration Conference opened in the capital yesterday. According to Land Administration Minister Li Jingzhai in his opening address, the convening of this conference is "an unprecedented event in our country and the first conference since the establishment of the Ministry of Land Administration." President Chiang attached great importance to land administration. On the day of the conference's opening, he issued a special instruction, giving many instructions for the future promotion of land administration. We feel that the convening of the National Land Administration Conference is of profound significance. In addition to wishing the conference success and hoping that the authorities can vigorously implement the resolutions of the conference after it concludes, so as to carry out land administration reform, we would like to offer some further comments.

Our country has been based on agriculture for thousands of years, and the land problem has become the root of social problems. As President Chiang stated, "The disputes, governance, chaos, rise, and fall of dynasties are all related to the land problem." Therefore, the Father of the Nation's advocacy of equal land rights is indeed a fundamental solution to China's social problems. The land policy of the Three Principles of the People originally had clear instructions, one being equal land rights and the other being land to the tiller, with the focus on "equal rights" and "ownership." Thus, the land policy of the Three Principles of the People does not involve the immediate nationalization of land or the socialization of land, but rather the maintenance of the private ownership system of land. However, for the sake of public interests, the government may legally restrict the use of privately owned land. Currently, the communist bandits are harassing the countryside, and the government is mobilizing to quell the rebellion. It can be seen that stabilizing the people's livelihood and consolidating the morale of the rural population are particularly important. It is hoped that our land administration authorities will strictly adhere to the teachings of the Father of the Nation and the instructions issued by the chairman of this land administration conference, so as to faithfully promote the land policy of the Three Principles of the People, so that our farmers, who have suffered greatly, can have a chance to catch their breath, and rural construction will have a bright future.

The scope that may be discussed at this land administration conference is likely to be quite broad. According to reports, the proposals for the conference roughly include: Establishing a land bank to coordinate with land policy; strengthening assistance to owner-farmers; opening collective farms and cooperative farms, etc. Because the system of primogeniture has long been extinct in China, and the law of inheritance in large proportions is not followed, there are really no true large landlords in China. Most of our large landlords are based on the power they have seized through annexation, rather than inheritance. Compared with the large landlords in Europe and Japan before the war, they are not the same. In the Northeast and North China, the proportion of owner-farmers is very high. However, because inheritance of property is divided and subdivided again and again, the area of farmland owned by owner-farmers is also decreasing, thus casting a shadow on agricultural production that is extremely unfavorable to mechanized farming. We hope that this land administration conference can have proper and feasible decisions on assisting owner-farmers and protecting tenant farmers.

Speaking of collective farms, this was originally a policy implemented by the Soviet Union after implementing its five-year plan, the purpose of which was to eliminate owner-farmers in order to achieve land nationalization or land socialization. In terms of its spirit, it may not be compatible with the land policy of the Three Principles of the People. As for cooperative farms, their nature is quite different from that of collective farms. Our country currently has many owner-farmers with very little cultivated land. The adoption of this cooperative farm system may well be sufficient to achieve the goal of strengthening assistance to owner-farmers. How exactly the cooperative farm system should be formulated in order to promote it to its fullest advantage is something that we especially hope this land administration conference will carefully study.

Regarding finance, in recent years our government has paid considerable attention to the land economy of farmers. There is already the establishment of the Farmers Bank of China and the creation of the Central Cooperative Treasury. In addition, state-owned banks and bureaus, such as the Central Trust Bureau, are also primarily responsible for coordinating agricultural land finance. At this time, whether a separate land bank should be created immediately outside of the existing system needs to be considered at length. Rather than considering something that is not yet mature and immediately establishing a large-scale organization, it seems better to instruct existing financial institutions to change their perspective and focus on lending for rural land, so that farmers have access to financing opportunities.

In addition, there are many things we should do in terms of land administration. We sincerely hope that this unprecedented land administration conference can lay a good foundation for the future land administration reform of our country.

### Truman Calls Meeting to Discuss Emergency Measures for Aid to Europe; Estimated Need of $500 Million This Year

[Special Dispatch] New York, 29th (Broadcast): President Truman met with eleven Congressional leaders and six government advisors at 10:00 AM today to discuss whether emergency aid could be given to European countries without convening a special session of Congress. The issue of controlling domestic prices will also be involved. Secretary of State Marshall returned from New York to Washington specifically to present his views on the serious food situation in Europe. According to Secretary Marshall, the United States cannot stand idly by in the face of this situation in Europe and must provide assistance before the end of the year. It is understood that Truman believes that this emergency expenditure will require at least $500 million in the next four months. France and Italy are in particular need of assistance.

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] President Truman is scheduled to meet with leaders of both houses of Congress at the White House at 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time today to ask for their support for transitional and long-term aid plans for Europe, and intends to launch a two-pronged war against high domestic prices and foreign famine. If Truman cannot obtain the cooperation of Congressional leaders to implement immediate aid to Europe, Europe may be close to collapse due to the lack of dollars, food, and fuel. Secretary of State Marshall returned to Washington from New York last night to join Secretary of Commerce Harriman, Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, and Undersecretary of State Lovett in attending the talks between the President and Congressional leaders. The issues to be decided at this meeting will include the following: Will Congressional leaders agree to use the existing funds of federal agencies, such as the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation, totaling approximately $500 million, to urgently assist countries facing intolerable cold and hunger, especially Italy and France? Do Congressional leaders recognize the need to convene a special session of Congress? After the United States officially accepts the mission of revitalizing Europe, that is, after the emergency crisis this winter is over, will Congressional leaders give the same special attention to the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe? Will Congressional leaders support Truman's waste reduction campaign to prevent further reductions in the current food export targets? Will Congressional leaders recognize the need to restore some of the government's wartime privileges through legislation to ensure that a sufficient amount of grain can be supplied to Europe this winter?

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Marshall is scheduled to fly back here from New York tonight to consult with Truman and leaders of both parties in Congress. Marshall only plans to stay here for one day on the 29th, and will fly back to New York the same night after the meeting. Marshall has previously stated that he is in favor of convening a special session of Congress, and it is expected that he will appeal to Congressional leaders. A few days ago, when Marshall was in Washington, he discussed the convening of a special session with Truman, but the President still did not agree to adopt this approach. It is said that Truman still advocates waiting until the formal convening of Congress on January 6th next year. Marshall has repeatedly emphasized that Europe cannot wait for the development of the aid to Europe plan and needs to be assisted immediately.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Regardless of whether Truman decides to convene a special session or not, the pressure to take administrative decisions immediately on domestic prices and foreign relief issues has been increasing daily. Some American officials are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the "self-help" guarantees of Europe under the Marshall Plan. After studying the reports submitted by Western European countries, they stated that the appeals of Western European countries seem to be "asking for assistance," rather than the "self-help" proposed by Marshall.

### Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe Not Easy to Implement in the Short Term; Congress Seems Unlikely to Take Swift Action

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The hope of the United States Congress taking swift and decisive action on the Marshall Plan has diminished. According to current forecasts, even if a special session of Congress is convened, it will not be possible to convene until December, and legislative procedures will not be completed until April next year. Some experts believe that although the recommendations made by Europe have a reasonable plan, it will be difficult for Truman and the State Department to convince Congress that Europe has a serious military crisis and must be given maximum assistance before Europe can promote its ability to help itself.

The report of the sixteen-nation economic conference was published just in time
in a week of international turmoil. The obvious features
can be said to be the following:

US officials are well aware that before the Marshall Plan can be fully
considered, the assistance to Europe to make up for shortages
cannot be delayed; some senior officials are hesitant about
the issue of convening a special session of Congress;
Vishinsky's speech caused various degrees of confusion and
resentment in American public opinion; after the report
of the sixteen-nation conference was released, members of both houses
took a very cautious attitude. American experts are already
finding it difficult to verify the facts provided in the sixteen-nation report,
as the report was drafted on the basis of broad
general regions rather than detailed and accurate analysis of a few countries or a certain region.

The United States is expected to have lengthy debates
on the following aspects of the report: Will US assistance
at the level requested in the report place too heavy a burden
on the United States? Are there other methods
that can replace government loans, such as restoring
large-scale private investment? Is the Western European
self-reliance plan appropriate if it does not include some of the more easterly
countries, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia? Is
the US aid to Europe plan necessarily to be given in the form of a gift,
or are there other alternative methods that can be discussed?

### East-West Split Widens, French Diplomacy at a Crossroads: Revival of Germany Must Not Impede French Security

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] If the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in London in November does not reach an agreement on the future status of Germany, then cooperation between France and the United Kingdom and the United States to organize Western Europe, especially Western Germany, will become more active. Official French spokespersons have so far denied that there will be any changes in French foreign policy. Technically speaking, this statement is indeed factual. However, France's position on the German question is that a four-power agreement should resolve the German question, taking into account its own minimum security needs. However, in the context of the widening East-West split, France's intermediate position has undergone some changes, at least behind the scenes.

If the November Foreign Ministers Conference fails to reach a four-power agreement and the United Kingdom and the United States decide to proceed with establishing a peacetime basis for West Germany regardless of the Soviet Union, then France will undoubtedly participate with the United Kingdom and the United States. If that happens, two problems will arise, one domestic and one concerning relations with the United Kingdom and the United States. Domestically, participating with the United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably provoke opposition from the Communist Party, but if France can obtain some quid pro quo, it may be possible to appease some domestic sentiment.

### Tram Workers Stage Illegal Strike, Mayor Announces Measures: Those Who Delay Resumption of Work Will Be Dismissed Unconditionally

"Reported by this newspaper" Mayor Wu, regarding the tram workers' strike, specially invited reporters to the City Hall conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday to announce the Municipal Government's attitude and four measures for dealing with this matter: Those who incite the strike will be severely punished according to the National General Mobilization Law. Wages will not be paid during the strike period. Those who obstruct the driving of trams will be immediately arrested on the spot by personnel dispatched from the Garrison Command and Police Bureau, on charges of obstructing traffic and endangering public safety, and may be dealt with severely according to military law. If necessary, the Social Affairs Bureau will be ordered to copy the list of those who delay resuming work and treat them as voluntarily resigning their positions, and dismiss them unconditionally, to be replaced by unemployed workers capable of driving trams.

The Mayor first stated: The workers' strikes of both the British and French tram companies did not follow legal procedures and violated the Labor Law and the National General Mobilization Law. These workers, who have been deceived, are being used by communist bandits. The workers' claim that the cost of living index does not match reality is unfounded. In fact, the indices are compiled according to scientific methods, and the figures obtained by the General Labor Union are completely consistent, which proves their accuracy. The General Labor Union previously notified all members that if they had any doubts, they could inquire with the union. Now, instead of making requests according to legal procedures, they have abruptly gone on strike, which is a disruptive act by treacherous bandits. The Mayor also stated: He hopes that good workers will not listen to the rumors of troublemakers and make unnecessary sacrifices.

Those Who Obstruct Trams and Resist Arrest Will Be Shot Without Mercy

"Central News Agency" Police Chief Superintendent Shu Ping told reporters that the British tram workers had already begun to resume work yesterday. The complications involving the French tram workers can also be resolved today. However, it was discovered yesterday that some unscrupulous individuals were obstructing trams along the way, attempting to prevent the resumption of work and continue to create major incidents. He has ordered all branches to pay close attention. If anyone continues to obstruct trams, they will be immediately arrested and prosecuted. If they attempt to resist with force, they will be shot on the spot without mercy.

### British Tramcars Resume Service: Social Bureau Instructs "Do Not Fall for the Enemy's Tricks," Union Resolves to Resume Work Immediately

"Reported by this newspaper" British tramcars have gradually resumed service since yesterday afternoon, and it is hoped that all will resume work today. However, French tramcars and public buses did not run yesterday, so the majority of public transportation in the city still relied on the City Public Utility Bureau's public buses. Passengers at each station felt doubly crowded. Moreover, yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and citizens were busy going back and forth, so rickshaws and pedicabs were all making a profit a hundredfold.

Yesterday morning, 36 tramcars on lines 7, 8, 10, and 11 from the British Hui Shan Depot, adopted a workaround, running only lines 8 and 10, with a total of 33 tramcars dispatched, departing on time. The Jing'an Temple Depot's streetcar and trackless trolley lines were all suspended due to the workers' strike.

The Social Bureau sent an instruction to the British Tram Industry Union in the morning, stating: "Upon investigation, the tram and public bus industries are related to public transportation, and it is not permitted to suspend operations arbitrarily. Especially during this period of national general mobilization, it is even less permissible to strike or slack off without authorization, as has been repeatedly ordered. The union's actions have generally been law-abiding. In this extraordinary period, it should strive to work hard to maintain the interests of the public. It is reported that some workers in the union went on strike without cause yesterday, using the inaccurate cost of living index as an excuse, but they did not apply to the bureau for verification through the union in accordance with the law. It is clear that someone is inciting them to deliberately disrupt the situation. The cost of living index is investigated, compiled, and managed by the Municipal Government, and it has always been extremely cautious. Before each announcement, representatives from relevant agencies are invited to jointly review it to ensure accuracy. The matter is technical in nature, and there are numerical bases, so there is no possibility of arbitrary increase or decrease. Moreover, the General Labor Union, representing all workers in the city, also conducted its own investigation and compilation this month. The figures compiled by the General Labor Union are roughly the same as those compiled by the Municipal Government, which further shows that the city's cost of living index is absolutely accurate. The union should use this understanding to carefully explain and supervise all members to resume work and continue working as usual today, and not fall for the enemy's cunning tricks that obstruct public transportation. This is of utmost importance."

Workers Receive Instructions, Hold Emergency Meeting

After receiving the order, the union immediately posted the full text of the instruction in front of the tram depot for public knowledge, and added, "Upon investigation, the union was not aware of this unfortunate incident beforehand or afterward. It is clear that actions were taken by someone acting under a false name. We hope that all members will abide by the instructions of the Social Bureau and the agency in charge and resume normal work immediately, and do not violate them. If there are reasons for complaint, you can appeal to the union, which will forward them for verification. Do not be used by others."

The union also convened the 23rd emergency meeting of the board of directors and supervisors at the union office at 10:30 AM, resolving that the union would immediately launch a campaign to resume tram operations. If any tramcars are obstructed en route, please have the military police protect them. As for the inaccurate cost of living index for this month, the union will petition the authorities to amend it.

Although it was difficult to gather workers because of the festival, under the union's persuasion, several tramcars on line 2 were the first to depart at 12:30 PM. Afterwards, more trams departed continuously. By evening, lines 2, 20, 24, and 3 of the Jing'an Temple Depot's streetcar and trackless trolley lines had resumed service, with 20 tramcars on line 2, 20 on line 20, 7 on line 24, and 3 on line 3. According to the union, it is possible that all lines will resume service today.

After the city's trams were suspended, the city's public buses became extremely crowded.

### Shui Xiangyun Discusses to Resolve Doubts About the Index

The workers of the British Tram Company expressed doubts about the cost of living index for September, leading to a work stoppage. General Labor Union President Shui Xiangyun issued the following statement yesterday: "Although this index is compiled by the Municipal Government Research Office, the union has also entrusted various unions to investigate commodity prices and submit them to the union for separate compilation, starting this month. The figures obtained are roughly the same as the figures compiled by the Municipal Government this time. The reason is that although the price of japonica rice has risen sharply this month, workers use indica rice as a standard for food rice, and the price of indica rice this month is still around 300,000 yuan. Moreover, the government distributes 2 dou per person, priced at 240,000 yuan. Although the market price of briquettes exceeds 80,000 yuan, the government distributes 1 dan per person, priced at 28,000 yuan. Although granulated sugar has also skyrocketed, the government distributes 1 jin per person. There is a huge difference between the allocated price and the market price. The above-mentioned major items in the cost of living index are all calculated based on the allocated price. Outsiders do not understand the inside story, which leads to doubts. If various unions have any doubts, they can inquire with the union about the content of the compiled materials, which can prove that this matter is accurate."

The sentence was pronounced at 3:00 PM yesterday. The main text: Yu Jingcheng is guilty of murder and is sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Qian Meilong, Ren Tingzhong, and Wang Yansheng are jointly guilty of intentionally inflicting bodily harm and are each sentenced to seven months of imprisonment. One Ma Pai pistol and nine bullets are confiscated. The civil claim for compensation is transferred to the Immigration Court. The main points of the reasons for the judgment are four: Although the defendant claimed that his pistol was seized by someone, causing the bullet to be fired and killing Liu and Li, the defendant could not point out who seized the pistol. The claim that if the defendant did not have a gun in hand, he would have been beaten down by the six or seven workers is not valid. However, an investigation revealed that the defendant was not injured, which shows that the defendant had a gun in hand. The plaintiffs, Liu and Li's family, Qian Hailong, Gao Hongye, and others, unanimously attacked the defendant for firing a shot first, knocking down Liu Jilin, and then firing a shot, knocking down Li Zhen. Seeing that they were not dead, he added another shot, which proves the defendant's criminal facts. The workers in the factory were all unarmed, so for the defendant's self-defense, he only needed to fire a shot into the sky to threaten them, which was enough to achieve the purpose of self-defense.

More than a hundred workers from China Textile who were listening in the court expressed that Yu Jingcheng was "wronged." They gathered in the District Court Square, holding small flags, posting slogans on the walls, and writing slogans with chalk, refusing to disperse for a long time, demanding that Yu be acquitted. Yu was later escorted out of the court through the back door by bailiffs to be executed at the Tilanqiao Prison. The workers from China Textile, upon hearing the news, still insisted on not leaving. It was not until around 5:00 PM that Councilor Fan Cai arrived at the scene to persuade them to return to the factory.

### Manager of Zhengtai Company Detained While Handling US Dollar Exchange

"Reported by this newspaper" The Bureau of Public Safety's Economic Section detected that Zhengtai Company, located on the third floor of 293 Hankou Road, was engaged in large-scale black market trading of US dollars. Yesterday morning, Section Chief Xu dispatched Team Leader Jing Qinghai, along with officers Lin Zhangsen, Peng Changrong, Yang Guoxian, and others, carrying a check, to pose as customers. They contacted Yang Wenzhang, the manager of the company. As a result, they completed a transaction of US$6,500. Just as they were about to settle the transaction, the police officers revealed their identities and detained Yang. They also searched the premises and found a total of US$7,115, which they took to the bureau along with Yang. According to Yang, the US dollars were shipped to Shanghai by Li Tongyun, the manager of Yixingxiang in Qingdao, and entrusted to him for sale. The police bureau, believing that the case was clear, confiscated all of the seized US dollars, and the suspect was temporarily released on bail.

### A Fatal Injection for Scabies: Doctor Claims Patient's Weakness Was to Blame

"Our News" Doctor Huang Ke-fang

is accused of negligent homicide,

and the trial opened yesterday in the Criminal Court of the District Court.

It began with Yang Lu-chuan, who was employed by the police

department. On June 17th, at approximately 7:00 PM, he and

his friend Zhang You-qing drove in a motorcycle from Zhang's residence on Zhongzheng East Road

to the clinic of the accused, Huang

Ke-fang, at 346 Yunnan Road, seeking treatment for a scabies

condition. Huang, noting that the disease had been treated multiple times, did not examine him

but immediately ordered his assistant Zhang Zheng-feng to inject 6.5 cc of medication

in a single shot. Unexpectedly, Yang reacted severely. In less than five

minutes, his limbs turned cold. He passed away from heart failure at 9:27 AM the following morning. The Old

Branch Bureau arrested Huang and handed him over to the District Court. According to Huang's

testimony: he and the victim had a friendly relationship,

and this incident was due to the victim's excessive weakness.

The victim's family is demanding compensation of

one hundred million yuan, which the accused claims he cannot afford.

The court ordered that the criminal part be retried on the sixth of next month,

while the civil part was to allow both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court.

### *Shen Bao*'s "Scholarship Fund" Recruitment Ends Today

Yesterday

was the

Mid-Autumn Festival

, and readers

must have

enjoyed a

day of celebration. However, in the vast city, countless

poor young people are agonizing over their studies, and many parents are worried about their

children's tuition. Of course, they will not have the leisure to enjoy the moon,

nor will they have extra money to eat mooncakes.

Dear readers, if you can save a little extravagance and donate some money to

the "Reader Scholarship Fund," perhaps a young person on the verge of being deprived of education

will have the opportunity to continue their studies!

Today is the last day for the "Reader Scholarship Fund" to collect donations. We hope

that readers will seize this last opportunity to give more assistance to needy students, so that the

"Reader Scholarship Fund" can come to a perfect end.

### Frugality in Gift-Giving, but No Moon on Mid-Autumn Festival

"Our News" Yesterday was the traditional

Mid-Autumn Festival. All agencies and schools did not

take a holiday. The banking industry also operated as usual.

Money was extremely tight, and the amount of exchanged checks

increased dramatically. The stock market interest rate was 25 to 28 cents.

However, despite the calls for frugality,

the practice of giving gifts was not

eliminated. The sales of mooncakes and chickens and ducks

were good, and the demand for vegetables, fish, and meat

increased even more, causing prices to rise

considerably higher than usual. In terms of transportation, because streetcars

have not fully resumed operation, pedicabs and

rickshaws took the opportunity to raise prices. The roads

were filled with people, resembling long dragons.

Looking up at the sky, it was overcast all day

without rain, and the bright moon did not appear at night.

Families still competed to burn incense and light

firecrackers as usual, spending this moonless reunion festival

in the refreshing evening breeze.

### Drug Den Cracked Down on Maken Road

Multiple Chinese and Foreign Customers Arrested

"Our News" On the 26th,

Criminal Police Chief Zhang

Zhang of the North Sichuan Road Police

Station received a tip that

inside No. 37 Maken Road,

some people were consuming drugs and injecting morphine. After Director Wu instructed

an undercover investigation, which confirmed the report, Inspector Li Hua-xuan led officers to the address

for a search, accompanied by the Baojia chief. As a result, they apprehended

chief, were verified without error, and taken to the bureau with the evidence for interrogation.

According to Jiang Ji-gen, the drugs were purchased from the old street area of Xinwen Road. The investigating

officer took the suspect to No. 15 Wende Li, Xinchang Bridge, where he identified Shi Chang-yuan, and six small packages of drugs were found on his person. He claimed

they were bought from Han Quan-fa, so Han Quan-fa was also arrested, as well as Shi Chang-fa,

who was sitting in the same room, for questioning. Finally, the foreigner Frank

Ners claimed that he came for an evening meal and wine,

and firmly denied any drug use. However, Yao Shen

testified that she personally witnessed him injecting morphine,

and the foreigner lowered his head in silence. As a result of the preliminary hearing,

Jiang Ji-gen, Zhu Gen-fa, Shi Chang-yuan, and Han Quan-fa

were all sent directly to the District Court for special criminal investigation.

Wang Yong-gui, Yao Chen, Jiang Yu-yu,

and Quan-fa, were sent to the police hospital for examination

and then processed.

at No. 38 Quan'an Hotel, Yangzhou Road. They went to the address and apprehended the accomplice Xu Sheng-liang,

39 years old, from Ningbo, and confiscated over one million yuan in stolen money.

robbed a man's and woman's watch each, a gold ring,

a gold pendant with a gold chain, and 460,000 yuan in cash. When they entered, they claimed to be visiting friends. Yuan

female servants, stuffing their mouths with cotton. They looted at will, and before leaving, they threatened

the victim's family, forbidding them from reporting to the police. The gold pendant, etc., had been sold by Xu and Lu

### Four Reasons for Participation: Requesting Reconsideration of the Dance Ban

A Letter Sent to the City Government for Submission to the Executive Yuan for Approval

"Big News" The

City Council

at this general

meeting made a

resolution on the

dance ban issue:

"The Council will state

the reasons and ask the

Central Government to reconsider

the clear ban on dancing,

and this city requests the

City Government to temporarily suspend

implementation." The Council

has completed

this resolution

yesterday,

sending it to the City Government,

and reporting it to the Executive Yuan

for approval. The stated

reasons are roughly as follows:

"In order to achieve the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country,

the Central Government called on the national people to practice thrift, which is solemn and righteous.

The Council, representing the citizens of the entire city, is sincerely supporting

it, and all the implementation measures have been tried to help promote it. However,

regarding the prohibition of commercial dance halls, after careful consideration,

it is felt that it is not entirely appropriate.

People have the freedom to choose

occupations and businesses without violating the law. This is the freedom

granted to the people by the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage, and it is also a basic

right that citizens of democratic countries should enjoy. Unless it harms the public interest,

the state may restrict or prohibit it by law.

There has never been a prohibition

on the operation of dance halls.

It has been around for a long time.

Only the government has legislation to manage and tax them, and there has never been

an express prohibition, which shows that it is not a business that harms the public

interest. If we consider the Constitution of the Republic of China, which has been promulgated and is urgently

to be implemented, there is no restriction on the legal business of private individuals, so the dance ban seems to limit the freedom of people to engage in legal

business.

Dancing is considered a normal entertainment

by all civilized countries in the world, so whether it is for social or international celebrations,

tea dances or dinner dances are common.

The Central Government initially had no prohibition on tea dances or dinner dances.

In that case, dancing is not prohibited in principle, only commercial

dance halls are prohibited.

Dance halls do not hinder thrift

If we take commercial

dance halls as

extravagant and ban them, then in this city, among the

thirty commercial dance halls, what they consume is only

tea, water, fruits, and snacks. Compared to restaurants and eateries with dinner dance facilities,

which consumes more? If we consider that commercial dance halls have

dance hostesses, then the dance hostesses exchange labor for compensation.

Since it does not increase the consumption of materials, it has nothing to do with the meaning of thrift.

And there are far more bad phenomena in society that violate thrift,

disrupt the economy, hinder public morals, and affect order than in dance halls.

Yet, the government has not strictly banned them. Therefore, the dance ban is

too much like abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the trivial in terms of its original intention of thrift.

Unnecessarily Increases the Unemployed

There are thirty

commercial dance halls

in this city, with as many as tens of thousands of employees, and no less than 200,000 people depend on them indirectly for a living.

If they are all banned from operating at once, it will immediately put 200,000 people in a state of unemployment

and starvation, posing a great threat to social stability. During the suppression of the rebellion,

the stability of the rear is no less important than the war on the front lines.

I am deeply afraid that the dance halls will be prohibited in the future. Thrift movements may not fully achieve the desired results, but will only

suddenly increase the number of unemployed people in society, and social security may be affected.

There is a concern that it may make things more complicated.

The Measures Are Still Difficult to Implement

The Council supports

national policy and does not

dare to fall behind, and it is the duty to convey the opinions of the majority of citizens

to the government. As for the phased prohibition measures formulated by the City Government, although they are more lenient, after detailed discussions,

there are still many difficulties and obstacles. According to the Constitution,

the central and local governments should adopt a system of balanced powers.

Those legislated and implemented by the central government are mostly related to national plans and involve matters of national unity. Listing the items and specifying the scope,

given the vastness of our country and the diversity of customs,

for dance halls and other similar types, whether they should be prohibited or not,

it is better to have local authorities take appropriate measures than to have the central government make rigid regulations."

### Assembly Continues to Discuss the Hardoon Garden Case

"Our News" The City Council's

fourth general assembly will continue to hold its seventh meeting this afternoon

to discuss various important proposals. This

morning, the Council's Public Works Committee

will hold a subcommittee meeting to review

measures for purchasing gasoline.

"Another News" Zhang Nai-zuo, Ma Jun-shuo,

Tao Bai-chuan, and other sixty-odd councilors

jointly proposed that the assembly approve the requisition

of Hardoon Garden on Nanjing West Road as a permanent park for the city

for citizens to relax and play. This afternoon,

at the assembly's seventh meeting, many councilors will propose

that it be put to discussion. The reporter specially visited a

legal expert for this matter, and asked his opinion

on whether the requisition of the garden as a

park has a legal basis. He replied as follows:

(Q) Can private gardens be requisitioned? (A)

The state may requisition privately owned land for public utilities and public health

or other matters where the government co-operates for the purpose of public interest,

in accordance with Articles 208, Section 3, 4, and 9 of the Land Law. (

Q) How should the price of the requisitioned land be determined legally?

(A) For land with legally determined prices, the legally determined

price shall be used. The provisions of Article 239 of the Land Law are very

clear. (Q) What is the legally determined price

of Hardoon Garden at present? (A) 10,000 yuan per mu.

### Hardoon Garden Donating Land to Build a Library Property Cannot Be Sold Temporarily Construction Funds Still a Problem

"Our News" Recently, a spokesperson for Hardoon & Co. told a reporter:

The City Council previously passed a resolution to lease Hardoon Garden

to open it as a park. At that time, the heirs of the estate politely declined.

Subsequently, after repeated discussions with the City Government, Hardoon & Co. intends to donate 15 mu of land along

Fuxu Road in Hardoon Garden to the City Government, and to build a library on the land. The funds

will be allocated from the charity fund. When Mrs. Hardoon, Luo Jialu, passed away, she designated about 20 mu of real estate in Xiaohuayuan,

Cideri and Cihe Li as a charitable fund. Only after these two properties

are sold can a portion of the proceeds be used to start building

the library. However, since

the victory and repatriation, all real estate owned by Hardoon & Co. has been suspended from registration,

transfer, and reissue of property rights certificates, and is still frozen. Therefore, it cannot be sold.

Also, about 2.7 mu of land in Wufu Lane, Nanjing Road, is also donated to the Chinese government.

It is also said that Hardoon & Co.'s current financial situation is very tight.

Rent is only collected at 3,240 times the pre-war amount, but taxes are numerous and the burden is very

heavy. The adopted sons and daughters of Mrs. Luo Jialing, the heirs of the estate, number more than twenty, all of whom depend on this for a living.

Furthermore, there is still debt incurred in 1935 to pay the UK government's inheritance tax, which was valued at 2.8 million yuan at the time.

This huge debt has not been settled to this day, which is expressed with a sense of deep emotion.

### Ningbo Needs New Construction

"Our Newspaper, Ningbo, 27th dispatch" Ningbo is the largest commercial port in Zhejiang, and also the largest import and export port on the southeast coast; Every day, sea

vessels travel to and from Shanghai, transporting seafood, local specialties such as bamboo shoots, lacquer, and bamboo products, and bringing back various industrial manufactured goods. It

was one of the five ports originally opened to trade with Westerners, and has a commercial history of over a hundred years, with a population of over 700,000. In terms of industry, it also has a very

good light industrial base, with thirty or forty large and small factories such as spinning, flour, and head, supplying daily necessities to various places in eastern Zhejiang.

After the Anti-Japanese War, its vitality has decreased a lot. The population has only 500,000 left, and the number of sea vessels traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo has decreased from seven to three,

clearly indicating the decline of commerce; in terms of industry, take Ningbo's largest He Feng Spinning Mill as an example: the number of spindles has decreased from 26,000 before the war to the current 6,000, employing only 400 workers, producing fourteen pieces of 20-count coarse yarn per day, and selling it to Wenzhou and Hefei to weave

homespun cloth.

Although this is the case, in the current situation of universal economic recession,

Ningbo is still a vibrant

commercial city, and the local

authorities are also quite committed to making the city prosperous.

This spring, when the reporter passed by Xikou,

Ningbo still looked very dilapidated.

It was not apparent that there was any recovery;

but six months later, when the reporter returned to Ningbo, the

first new impression was that most of the roads had been leveled.

The main thoroughfares

have been repaved with asphalt.

Tung trees have also been planted

on both sides of East Street, making it even grander than Shanghai's

Fei Road. The reason why they

were able to carry out such a large-scale repair is that the

shops along the road were willing to donate hundreds of thousands of yuan

to cover the expenses. This would be difficult to do in Hangzhou;

from this, we can also see that the economic

situation of the people in Ningbo is relatively good. Moreover, Ningbo

also has public prostitutes and back alleys. The brothels

in the Cangshui Street area are doing better than before the war. In the hotels and tea houses,

the waiter always has a list of first and second-class "

famous flowers" available, and house calls by phone are very convenient.

Wealthy merchants and tycoons spend three million yuan

on a table of flower wine, without any stinginess—Ningbo

, can you say it's not doing well?

But tearing open this layer of luxurious decoration,

and looking at its inner layer, we can't be optimistic.

A fellow businessman from Ningbo told me that before the war,

shops in Ningbo had a lot of inventory stored in warehouses,

but now they can only decorate the storefronts.

Some of the display windows are not even full!

This shows the emptiness within the merchants.

A county councilor shouted loudly in the council: "Today, civil servants are on strike,

tomorrow, the dung collectors are making trouble. This clearly shows the

instability of society"! And this also shows

the economic difficulties of the general public.

County Magistrate Chen Youhua said to the reporter very seriously: "The people of Ningbo are simple and unadorned, diligent

and thrifty." This is certainly the "magic weapon" for the people of Ningbo to start a business, and it is also the reason why there are

few entertainment venues in Ningbo City and no coffee shops

or tea houses on the streets; but economic factors

are probably also an important reason. The number of beggars in Ningbo

also clearly shows the economic recession in society.

Fishing Center

Ningbo's fish market has essentially become the center of the entire province. Zhejiang's fishing areas

Four major products -

large and small yellow croaker, squid and ribbonfish - and

other seafood are concentrated in Ningbo and Shenjiamen.

In Ningbo, 70% of the fish products are transported to Shanghai and then sold to various parts of the country; 10% are transported to

Yuyao and Shaoxing via inland rivers, and 20% are retained in the

city to supply the citizens. In addition to fish products, Ningbo's

grain was originally also exported. But when the reporter arrived in Ningbo, a ban had just been issued, because there had been

insect plagues this autumn. According to the county government's statistics, the loss of late rice in each

township reached 70%, as much as 90%. Therefore, except for special concessions for neighboring counties lacking grain, exports

were completely prohibited. However, Taifeng Flour Mill produces 100 bags of flour per day, and under the

circumstances that traffic in North China is inconvenient and commercial transportation is blocked, large quantities are transported to Shanghai. This is a phenomenon that has only occurred after the war.

Speaking of public utilities, Ningbo people often

take pride in them. In fact, they are indeed doing

well. For example, Ningbo has sufficient electricity,

and the telephone service is very reliable. Although it is manually connected, it is

more reliable and faster than Shanghai's automatic telephone.

The only problem is that the drinking water is always

too bad and always salty. Soon, a trial run of urban public

buses will be carried out by the Yin Chuan Company on the section from Jiangdong to the western suburbs; the new

Jiang Bridge, which connects the Jiangdong and Jiangbei districts, is also being worked on for repair and reinforcement. I deeply

hope that the people of Ningbo will more actively exert their traditional spirit of "diligence, thrift and hard work"

to push Ningbo towards a more modern path.

Because Ningbo does not have a housing shortage, housing does not require a premium, and rent is also lower than in Hangzhou.

The premium for shop houses is at most tens of millions; and the public security in the city

is very good, making it a place where people can

live and work in peace.

Some local gentry

want to develop the Dongqian Lake in the eastern district, decorating a

country girl in a fashionable manner, hoping

to compete with Hangzhou's West Lake to beautify the city.

In fact, I think a city should have

its own characteristics. For over a hundred years, Ningbo

has had a considerable industrial and commercial foundation. In the future, when the Hangyong Railway is built and the

entire Huhangyong Railway is restored,

it will be located at the transportation hub by sea and land, and its prosperity is sure to come soon. Why bother to build

a scenic area too far from the city? Currently, the focus should be

on academic culture, so that future

Ningbo will not have too much money-grubbing and

appear empty in its spiritual life. Museums

and libraries have been destroyed and no longer exist; the world-famous "Tianyi Pavilion"

also has rare books, but they are hidden and not used;

the school buildings of Advanced Industrial School, Eastern Zhejiang,

Zhengshi and other secondary schools have been damaged and have not yet been restored; all this indicates

that there is a need for major construction in culture. And this kind of need

is as important as repairing roads and opening public motor vehicles.

### Ningbo Gasoline Leak into the Sea Case: Yu Jinzheng Makes a Defense

"Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 27th" Ningbo gasoline
leaked into the sea, funding the Shandong communist bandits. According
to the suspect, Yu Jinzheng, he was entrusted by Zhang Ruiwen of Ningbo Changji
Automobile Company to purchase 200 barrels of gasoline in Hangzhou, which were transferred by the station chief of the Shao-Yu Wuyun station.
Upon arrival in Ningbo, the gasoline leak incident occurred, and he was detained by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Sixth
District Security Command. Since the oil drums belonged to him, it was rumored that it was Yu's oil, but in fact, it had
nothing to do with him. It is learned that this case is currently under trial, and the truth will come to light soon.

### Completion of the Dangtu Grand Iron Bridge

(Our

the various departments and offices of the Anhui Provincial Government sent personnel to Bengbu to take over enemy and puppet organizations and remaining
assets. Wang Xianyou and the fugitive Liu Yuemin, using the names of employees and managers of the Zhongyuan Trust Company, assisted the government in taking over foreign firms, taking the opportunity to obtain
a large amount of materials, including over a thousand cans of kerosene, three hundred boxes of soap, eighty bolts of black cloth, five or six boxes of ledger
paper, two hundred barrels of soybean oil, and over ten thousand sacks, which they privately sold and divided the profits.
Last September, the Third Group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region Enemy and Puppet Assets Investigation Team discovered in Bengbu
that Liu Yuemin and Wang Xianyou had indeed committed the crime of embezzling public property. Because Liu fled in fear of punishment,
the Wang was transferred to the Fengyang Local Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. It is learned that Wang was sentenced yesterday by the Local Court Criminal
Division to three years and six months of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights. This is an example of making a "takeover" fortune in Bengbu.

### General Overview of China's Sausage Casing Industry - Survey by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Department

I. Introduction

The export of Chinese sausage casings dates back to the late Qing Dynasty. Initially, Russians bought them in the Tianjin area of North China and shipped them abroad. Germans then began purchasing them, establishing factories in cities such as Shanghai and Hankou to process and cure them. Later, the scope of procurement widened daily, and sales also expanded. Merchants from countries like Britain, the United States, and France also followed suit. Chinese people then competed to imitate them, setting up their own factories, presenting a vigorous scene for a time. However, since Chinese businessmen were unfamiliar with export business and found it difficult to find foreign counterparts, the finished sausage casings were all resold to foreign firms. Payments were made in domestic currency, so there was no way to easily obtain foreign exchange. After the establishment of domestic companies engaged in direct export, foreign trade in sausage casings gradually became important, and the business of foreign firms involved in sausage casings gradually decreased, recently accounting for only one or two tenths.

II. Types of Sausage Casings

Sausage casings can be divided into three types: pork casings, beef casings, and sheep casings. Pork and sheep casings are cured with salt and then packed in wooden barrels for export. Beef casings must be dried in the sun and sprinkled with pepper powder before being packed in wooden boxes with lead lining for export. The production quantity of beef and sheep casings is not large, while pork casings are more common and account for the majority of sausage casing exports. The term "sausage casing" usually refers to pork casings. The areas where pork casings are concentrated for curing and export are Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other ports.

III. Quality of Pork Casings

The finer the color of pork casings (i.e., the diameter), the better. According to size standards, they are generally divided into large and small. From 24 mm to 36 mm, 24 mm to 34 mm are considered small strips, and 34 mm to 36 mm and above are considered large strips. Small strips are the superior grade, and large strips are the inferior grade. Quality and color are also related. The best quality is those without damage, and the best color is reddish. Light red and pinkish-white are next best, while yellow and black are the worst. Pork casings produced in the suburbs of Shanghai, along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, and in southern Anhui are of very good quality. They are thin-skinned and clean, and the diameter is even and small. Except for the color, which is not as tender as American sausage casings, other aspects are admired by countries around the world. Sausage casings produced in provinces such as Hunan and Henan are mostly thick-skinned and have sinews, while those produced in the east are thick-skinned and have coarse sinews, so the quality is inferior.

IV. Number of Processing Factories

There are 59 sausage casing curing factories and workshops in Shanghai that have joined the trade association. Among them, 41 are workshops and 18 are factories, including 5 foreign-owned factories. Eleven factories are engaged in export business. Each factory has a workforce ranging from over 20 to over 10 workers. Each sausage casing workshop employs about three to four workers. The number of workers in each factory and workshop varies depending on the peak and off seasons.

V. Processing Volume

About 10,000 barrels of sausage casings were cured in the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], about 2,000 barrels in the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], and about 1,500 barrels in the first half of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947].

VI. Processing Procedures

Pork casings exported from Shanghai can be divided into two types: salted and dried. The sources can be divided into two types: fresh and raw. The details are as follows: Shanghai has a dense population, and pork accounts for the majority of meat supply and demand. Three-quarters of the pig intestines slaughtered daily are given to sausage casing factories for processing into sausage casings. After the fresh intestines enter the factory, they are soaked in water for 24 hours and then removed. They are scraped with a rectangular bamboo piece to remove fat and other impurities, and then rinsed several times with clean water to make them clean inside and out. Then they are soaked in a vat again for about 24 hours until the casing is milky or slightly reddish. They are then taken out, bleached, and dried. The length and diameter are measured, and they are tied up separately.

The length of each salted casing is 13.5 yards, and at most three strips are tied together. Fine salt is added. The next day, they are tied into bundles by hand and placed in a flat-bottomed bamboo basket. Each basket can hold 200 bundles. The bamboo baskets are stacked and pressed heavily to reduce moisture and make it easier to pack into barrels. Each barrel contains 2,500 or 1,250 bundles, and fine salt or more saltpeter is added to each casing. Then the barrel is covered, nailed firmly, and the barrel packing procedure is completed.

The method of making raw goods is similar to that of fresh goods, but the salt used before they are shipped to Shanghai from places such as Rugao, Taixing, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou in Jiangsu, Wenzhou, Hangzhou, Lanxi, Shaoxing in Zhejiang, Wuhu, Bengbu, Hefei, Anqing in Anhui, Jiujiang in Jiangxi, and Chongqing in Sichuan, is of poor quality. The goods are rough and black, and some are mixed with alum, which discolors the casings and is not very popular with sausage casing merchants. Therefore, after being shipped to Shanghai, they must be further processed before being packed into barrels for export.

The method of making dried casings is similar to that of salted casings, but no salt is used. After scraping and bleaching, they are dried in the sun, then flattened, and sorted by length and diameter for packing into wooden boxes for export.

Beef casings can also be divided into two types: salted and dried. First, the small and large intestines of cattle are soaked in clear water for about 24 hours. Then they are washed and scraped to remove all fat and other tissues, and then rinsed clean with clear water. Then they are submerged in a large amount of clear water. The next day, they are scraped and washed again. The casings are inflated to check for breaks. Damaged ones are eliminated, and the intact ones are dried in the sun. Pepper powder is sprinkled, and they are flattened. Each casing is about 20 meters long, and ten casings are tied together and packed into a lead-lined wooden box, about 20 bundles per box. The method of making salted beef casings is the same as that of salted pork casings.

Sheep casings are only made with salt. The method is similar to that of salted pork casings. The packaging is 500 bundles per barrel, with 3 casings per bundle, and up to 6 strips per casing. The length is about 34 yards.

VII. Export Volume

Before the war, the total annual export volume of sausage casings was about 10,000 barrels, with about 4,500 barrels exported from Shanghai, about 3,500 barrels exported from Hankou and Chongqing, and about 2,000 barrels exported from Tianjin and Qingdao. The distribution of overseas markets is as follows:

1. Northern European countries (including Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Czech Republic, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, etc.) about 6,000 barrels per year.

2. Mediterranean countries (including France, Italy, Spain, and Balkan countries) about 1,500 barrels per year.

3. The United Kingdom and its territories (including South Africa) about 500 barrels per year.

4. The United States about 2,000 barrels per year.

From the victory to the end of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], the total export volume of the country was about 2,000 barrels, of which 60% were pre-war inventories and 40% were those collected and processed after the victory. Among them, about 1,300 barrels were shipped to the United States and about 700 barrels were shipped to Europe.

VIII. Current Difficulties

After the victory in the autumn of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], overseas selling prices were originally very low, but they could barely cover costs. This year, due to foreign exchange rates, exporting a barrel incurs a maximum loss of 40%. Recently, due to rampant smuggling in South China, Hong Kong, which previously had no sausage casing exports, is now secretly the center of sausage casing exports, resulting in a further decline in overseas selling prices. For example, in the United States, the price per bundle (two casings, 27 yards long) was about 90 US cents in the spring of this year, but is now as low as 33 US cents. In Switzerland, the price has also fallen from over 1.8 Swiss francs per casing to just over 70 cents, which has a huge impact on exports. On the cost side, due to increased salt taxes, the cost per barrel has increased by about 700,000 yuan. Other expenses have also increased due to the general rise in labor and commodity prices, making exports increasingly difficult. In addition, the price of pig intestines is currently based on the price of pork. In the past, the purchase price of sausage casings per casing (13.5 yards long) was equivalent to the market price of one catty of fresh meat. The price of meat in rural areas was lower than in commercial cities, so the price of pig intestines was naturally cheaper, so the villagers were happy to buy them. Fresh intestines were transported to cities, sold to sausage casing factories for curing and export. Now, the price of meat has risen to over 10,000 yuan, while the price of fresh intestines per casing is still less than 5,000 yuan. Moreover, due to transportation and other difficulties, villagers are unwilling to transport them, or sell them locally as fertilizer, or use them as food. If the purchase price is not increased, the processing volume of sausage casing factories cannot be increased and will decrease day by day.

### On Medical Talents

— Hua Xinren

The most popular saying nowadays is, "Incompetent doctors kill people," and "Failing to rescue the dying." But, thinking calmly, our hospitals are indeed inefficient in "saving people." In fact, the entire country feels the lack of scientific medical talents. This is not just a problem for hospitals, but a serious problem facing the country.

Why do we feel a lack of scientific medical talent? There are many reasons for this, and it is difficult to explain in a few words. But the most fundamental reason is that medical administration and medical education are not on the right track. At the same time, society has not formed an environment for cultivating scientific medical talent. Because of this, many geniuses cannot advance rapidly, many public health doctors cannot realize their ambitions, and many useful doctors are abandoned in useless places. If this factor is not changed, the health of the nation cannot be transformed, public health undertakings cannot be promoted, and the future of scientific medicine has absolutely no hope. Therefore, increasing scientific medical talent is a fundamental issue for the prosperity of the country and the health of the nation. We must conduct a thorough exploration and objective research. We know that the development of a career is related to talent, and talent is mostly cultivated successfully. International cultivation is effective, and talents are naturally born in large numbers. Promotion is timely, so outstanding individuals emerge. Confucius said, "In a village of ten households, there must be loyal and trustworthy people." Today, the decline of scientific medicine in our country is not because there is no talent, but because talent is not being used properly. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "Everyone should be given their due," and also said, "If cultivation is done right, then Heaven will not waste talent; if encouragement is proper, then the wild will not suppress talent; if employment is lawful, then the court will not have mediocre officials." These are truly excellent words and good strategies for governing the world. Unfortunately, the current medical community emphasizes idols and qualifications, while neglecting talent, resulting in the burying of many outstanding talents. This is because cultivation is not being done properly. After the commercialization of medicine, there is an emphasis on making money and neglecting function, resulting in the loss of medical ethics and the degradation of medical practices. This is because encouragement is improper. Furthermore, colleagues in the medical community often prioritize personal relationships and factions, resulting in a relative weakening of strength. This is because employment is not lawful. How can we talk about proper cultivation with such medical administration and medical education?

Speaking of our health administration, it prioritizes personal relationships and neglects righteousness, or forms groups of fellow villagers and classmates, advancing and retreating based on personal interests, and all actions are wrong. Such people only know factions and do not ask about virtue or stupidity, causing those with aspirations for public health to have the mindset of short-term officials. As a result, doctors have no ambition to be loyal to their duties. Therefore, those who serve in public health agencies are only solving their livelihood, and have no empathy for patients. In addition, there are conflicts of interest among individuals. Struggles in the school system, environmental constraints, and mutual attacks result in harm to patients. This fragmented situation leads to social criticism. Everyone points the finger at scientific medicine as being incompetent doctors, and public hospitals as being murderous slaughterhouses. Criticism and complaints are everywhere. Such a painful lesson is unbearable to speak of. If people in our medical community do not change course, then public health undertakings will inevitably perish together.

The current trend is all influenced by money, so even doctors with noble benevolence and medical skills have to strive for profit, flatter, shirk responsibility, be servile, and smile obsequiously. This is also the passivity caused by the bureaucratization of our medicine, and it is a scourge of our scientific medicine. The scientific medical community has such villains, which will inevitably lead to a lack of enthusiasm for service, and medical treatment will not be satisfactory, and misleading patients will be their forte. Like this, it is very dangerous for both public and private. As the old saying goes, like attracts like. If our medical community continues to emphasize striving for profit and welcomes flattery and adulation, then good doctors and public health doctors will inevitably protect themselves wisely, while greedy and mediocre doctors will certainly seek undeserved advancement. Like this, scientific medicine in our country will not have hope at all. Therefore, we should denounce them loudly.

We know that worshiping idols and emphasizing qualifications may have its own value in peaceful and prosperous times. But, at the beginning of this turbulent national construction, it seems that we should not overemphasize them. What day is today? It is a time of national crisis and low national health. If public medical care only possesses empty fame and cannot match the name with reality and seek happiness for the people, then the people of the world will forever be sinners of the nation. Since our country has had health institutions, from the central to the provincial and municipal health officials, each has their own merits regarding the quality of health administration. What is regrettable is that our country has undergone the historical War of Resistance, and health and medicine have failed to nurture new and outstanding talents. Is it really that there are no good talents, or is it that the authorities have not properly promoted and entrusted them with important tasks? The young people who joined the health work during the eight years of the War of Resistance are now over forty years old. Among them, there may be many with loyalty and ingenuity, and the skills to bring the dying back to life. If we can use their strengths, promote them, entrust them with important tasks, give them hope, and grant them power to increase their prestige, then there must be those among them who can "send out great talents to overcome difficulties" and establish a long-term foundation. The power of British, American, and Soviet medicine today is due to the strong economic and scientific foundations of their countries, and the biggest factor is the abundance of new talents. In the future, if scientific medicine is to develop, first of all, we must reverse the declining medical ethics, emphasize integrity, and then the path of villains will be eliminated, and if we choose the virtuous and capable, then there will be no abandoned talents in the wild. This is what Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Everyone should be given their due," with the heart of serving the world, opening the path to selecting the virtuous and capable, so that scientific medicine can be brought back to life.

### Talking About Improving Utensil Lids from a Physiological Hygiene Perspective

— Baizhi

Why do we need lids for bowls, pots, jars, cups, and other utensils for holding food? Needless to say, the purpose is to ensure the cleanliness of the food and prevent the intrusion of dust and various unclean substances. But times are different, knowledge has expanded, and the concepts and types of so-called unclean substances have also changed somewhat. And the various lid styles designed by previous generations are now somewhat unsuitable for practical use, and there is a need for improvement.

Now, let's talk about the types of unclean substances first. According to the minds of people in previous times, the unclean substances that could invade food in jars, bowls, and other utensils were nothing more than dust falling from above and sand blown by strong winds. As for flies gathering and eating, it was not considered unclean. A wave of the hand to drive away flies and gnats, and then picking up the food and putting it into the mouth and swallowing it into the stomach was no big deal. Now, that's not okay. We know that flies and gnats carry the danger of spreading typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and various other germs. Because flies and gnats like to gather and eat feces. The feces of typhoid patients, the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients, and the stool of dysentery patients all have a rich abundance of germs. Flies and gnats are very fond of having a banquet there. Once they are there, their feet, wings, and mouths are contaminated with many germs. They carry many germs and fly to the banquet, like bombers loaded with bombs, flying over our heads. The places they land on are contaminated with many germs. They take one step and contaminate one step, take two steps and contaminate two steps, like Pan Fei's lotus feet, leaving fragrant footprints. If they land on food and drink, they contaminate the food and drink. If they crawl on utensils, they contaminate the utensils. If they stop on the table, they contaminate the table. I often see them liking to land on the edge of cups and dishes, stop for a moment, and like to circle around the rim. Like soldiers guarding the city, circling on the city wall. As a result, the rim of this cup or dish is contaminated by them. Especially flies, after eating their fill of filth, swarm to clean places, and like to spit out a little filth, and spot this clean place. In summer, white clothes often have a stain for no reason. This is the filth spit out by flies. Ancient people only knew that flies could stain white clothes, but they never said that flies stained food and drink. Therefore, the fact that flies and gnats can cause food and drink to be unclean was not noticed in the minds of ancient people.

There are also the nasal secretions of people with stomach problems, and the phlegm of people with tuberculosis, especially the phlegm of people with laryngeal tuberculosis, all of which contain many pathogens. Once they are coughed and spat out, they fly in the air with tiny droplets and fall on food and drink, cups, dishes, and tables, which will also contaminate food and drink, cups, dishes, and tables. This kind of unclean substance was also not noticed in the minds of ancient people.

Now I will criticize the kinds of lids of the utensils holding food that are commonly seen every day, using diagrams to illustrate them, and then other types can be inferred by analogy.

The lid shown in the picture is the most common. The lids for bowls of rice and side dishes are all like this. This is the most unreasonable lid. It leaves the rim of the bowl exposed. All kinds of unclean substances can easily contaminate it. Whether it is dust, sand, flies and gnats, or sneeze and cough droplets, they can all fall on it. Moreover, this lid has a domed back. If liquid unclean substances fall on the back of the lid or the inner edge of the bowl, they can directly flow into the bowl and contaminate the food and drink. Even if we exclude liquid unclean substances, the unclean substances that are contaminated on the rim of the bowl by flies and coughs will also fall into the bowl when the lid is opened. If the bowl contains liquid drinks such as soup, when we pick it up or use a spoon to stir it, the liquid will also move upwards to the contaminated area and be contaminated. Moreover, we often put our mouths to the rim of the bowl, to the contaminated area of the rim, and the unclean substances will enter our bodies and intestines.

This kind of lid is often seen on teacups, and it is much better than the first type. Unclean substances will not contaminate the rim of the cup, nor will they directly enter the cup. There is also no danger in drinking tea with our mouths to the rim of the cup. But there is one very important thing to note! That is, when this kind of lid is lifted, you must not put the lid on the table casually, you must turn it over, and make the back of the lid touch the table, and teach it to lie on its back. Because the surface of the table is difficult to protect without contamination of unclean things, if you do not turn the lid over and put it on the table, then the belly side of the lid will touch the table, and there will be the possibility of pollution. When you go to cover the cup again, it will contaminate the rim of the cup and the drink in the cup.

This kind of lid is the best. The unclean objects on the outside will neither invade the rim of the dish and the drink food in the dish, nor can it be opened and placed arbitrarily on the table. Even if the rim of the lid is contaminated by unclean objects on the table, fortunately it covers the outside of the dish and will not spread to the inside of the dish. We use this method to do pure culture of bacteria. I think all kinds of utensils for holding food should be made with this type, almost to ensure the safety and cleanliness of food and drink. Especially at the turn of summer and autumn, when cholera, dysentery and other acute gastrointestinal diseases are prevalent, you have to be very careful.

### Reading Medical Notes (1) New Uses for Color Blind People

— Liang Junqing

When we doctors examine people's physiques, we always have to check whether that person has color blindness. If there is color blindness, then most of these color blind people will not be admitted, because color blind people cannot distinguish between red and green, which can often cause many problems in public affairs. As for traffic management, those color blind people are even more inadmissible. However, in this Second World War, the US military actually massively recruited this group of color blind people and placed them in the aviation field. This is truly a strange thing. But to be blunt, it is not strange at all, because although that group of color blind people cannot distinguish between red and green, they have a strong ability to distinguish between natural colors and camouflaged colors, whether it is a city or a military stronghold, as long as there are camouflaged facilities, they can immediately distinguish them. Germany's city camouflage techniques were very clever, and British and American pilots were often fooled, but since employing color blind people, they can immediately distinguish the camouflaged areas, and as a result, German cities were greatly destroyed. Although the world today cannot be said to be peaceful or at war, color blind people are temporarily unemployed.

However, because color blind people are good at identifying the levels of pigments, perhaps they will be able to develop their ability to identify the authenticity of ancient paintings in the future.

A New Method of Treating Trachoma with Sulfa Drugs.

We have long known that trachoma can be treated internally with Sulfanilamide tablets or other sulfa drugs. Many magazines have long reported its many effects. But because its toxicity is too high, it not only irritates the stomach and intestines, but also destroys red blood cells too severely, so many doctors are always hesitant to try it. Some doctors want to make sulfanilamide into an ointment and apply it directly to the affected area of trachoma, but because of its excessive irritant properties, it is often extremely painful, and often causes the eyelids to swell, so ophthalmologists dare not use it either. Now, after many studies, we know that using 12% sulfanilamide ointment can reduce many irritations. If you wash the affected area with 3% boric acid water before applying this ointment, then it will be even more harmless.

### The Importance and Treatment of Whooping Cough

— Shou Wuqing

Currently, coughing is prevalent, and there are many child sufferers in the neighborhoods. Among them, besides colds and flu, there are quite a few whooping cough patients. Whooping cough is also known as "百日咳 or 癨咳" because when coughing, there is always thick, sticky phlegm, resembling the saliva of a domestic bird, expelled from the mouth. It's also called "天哮咳" because during frequent and severe coughing, the patient gasps for air, stretches their neck upwards, and takes a deep, long breath to relieve the distress of persistent coughing and wheezing.

Whooping cough is one of the infectious diseases of children, and uninfected adults are also susceptible. Schools, organizations, nurseries, cinemas, parks, and neighborhoods are all places where the disease can spread, and homes are particularly close-knit exchange points for the disease. Therefore, within a family, it is common for three or four siblings to suffer from the disease at the same time. Their coughs sound like thunder, continuous and uninterrupted, and the illness lasts for quite a long time, disturbing people's peaceful sleep, and causing parents to dislike it.

Whooping cough is highly contagious. The source of the disease is the whooping cough bacillus, which is transmitted through the droplets ejected during coughing. Healthy children within a four-foot radius of infected children are generally at risk of infection. From the time the bacteria enter the body to the initial onset of the disease, it takes about one to two weeks. The symptoms can be divided into three stages.

The first stage involves symptoms like a cold, such as coughing, a red throat, a runny nose, a slight fever or no fever, a normal appetite, and no special systemic symptoms, lasting for about two weeks. (To be continued)

### Habits of Desert Animals

— Guanchao

Deserts are barren lands, with little water and no trees, only sparse shrubs or weeds dotting the vast expanse of sand. Animals need water and food, so deserts are not suitable places for animal life. In other words, it is difficult for animals to live in desert regions. However, in reality, the animals in the desert are not as simple or as rare as we imagine.

To explain this phenomenon, let's start with the general characteristics of desert plants. Desert plants have two special features: plants that grow in the desert generally have very short stems and trunks, reduced leaf surfaces, or even completely degenerate leaves, making them difficult to identify. The most common form is thorns, such as the many thorns of cacti, which is a good example. This special characteristic is naturally the result of the lack of water in the soil and the plant's need to reduce evaporation. In addition, we must pay attention to the special distribution of desert plants. Desert plants are never like the green grass of the grasslands or the dense foliage of the forests, obscuring the sky. Instead, they are scattered among the sand and stones, like stars scattered across the sky. This sparse distribution is not necessarily due to the uneven distribution of underground water in the desert. In other words, the existence of plants on the surface does not necessarily indicate the presence of water underground. Conversely, the absence of plants on the surface does not necessarily indicate the absence of water underground. We must understand that although the above-ground parts of desert plants are reduced, their root systems are often very developed, extending in all directions underground to a considerable distance to absorb water. Many shrubs store large amounts of water within their plant tissues, such as cacti, which are particularly rich in water storage. These water-storing plants satisfy their own physiological needs, but humans or animals often rely on them as the only source of water in the desert.

Besides these water-storing shrubs, in desert areas that do not rain for years or only have slight rain once or twice a year, there are often plants with extremely short lifespans. These plants grow quickly, flower, and bear fruit when there is sufficient rain. They complete their life cycle in a short period of time. When it is dry, they wither, leaving the underground parts, which can grow again when it rains. These plants generally have fleshy leaves and fleshy fruits. Because of their short lifespan and rapid growth, they do not exhibit the scattered distribution of shrubs.

The above-mentioned plants have methods to adapt to their special environment, so they grow quite well and are distributed relatively abundantly, providing the only food and water supply for animals. There are also some animals that do not need to drink water, relying only on the water content of their food and the dew that collects on it. Rodents like the red-necked gazelle, or many insects and other invertebrates, are probably like this.

A few desert areas are completely dry and completely lack springs or water holes. The rare rain, or only rain in small areas, sometimes creates temporary rivers, but they only last for a few hours or days. Some large deserts are surrounded by high mountains, and the water from the rivers can often flow a considerable distance and seep into the sand. This water that seeps into the sand can only be absorbed by plants or drawn by people from wells to supply water to animals that need to drink or need a lot of water. However, these water sources are not long-term or permanent, only limited to a certain period. Therefore, animals that need more water must have special adaptive habits to survive. Many animals can store water in their bodies. When there is a water source, they drink a lot of water, which can last for a considerable period of time. For example, the camel, which we are familiar with, can store water in the tissues of its stomach. This is a good example. Camels are very common in the deserts of Africa, Arabia, and Mongolia. The Mongolian species have two humps, while the others have only one. They are the most important means of transportation in the desert. Sometimes their owners rely on them to supply milk and water as food for long journeys. In addition, many reptiles that live in the desert can also store water in their organs or body cavities. For example, the desert tortoise in Colorado can live in extremely dry places, sometimes existing sixty miles from a water source. It can be said that they can live in places where other animals cannot live. Some lizards can also store large amounts of water in their bodies. Locals often use them as drinking water, so they are an important source of water in dry areas. There are also amphibians that generally need humid air and watery habitats because their eggs and tadpoles must grow in water. However, the Australian water-holding frog (Chiroleptes) is different from ordinary frogs. It can store water in its body cavity and live in burrows. The water emitted by the frog's body creates humid air in the burrow. Locals often obtain drinking water from them. (To be continued)

### Minor Inventions

— Zhao Nan

Machine for Washing Fish

A new type of scaling machine weighing four and a half tons can clean ten large fish per minute. The fish are placed in the machine and automatically pass through five pairs of rotating brushes to scrape off the scales, and then pass through a narrow slit, and the fish are cleaned. Small fish washing machines are being manufactured competitively by various factories.

Airborne Typewriter

American Bell Telephone Co. recently designed an airborne typewriter weighing only thirty-five pounds. In addition to a sophisticated standard typewriter, this airborne typewriter also has a switching management machine. The switching management machine converts the code into audio frequency, so it can be transmitted using the existing radio equipment on the aircraft. The receiver on the ground then converts the audio frequency back into a code, creating electrical impulse, which is then typed directly and identically on a corresponding typewriter.

Fluorescent Vacuum Needle

The total number of molecules in a unit volume can be indicated by the color displayed on the fluorescent screen of the fluorescent vacuum needle. This instrument is twelve inches long, wide, and four and a half inches high, and can immediately indicate the working condition of the vacuum mechanism.

Five-in-One Tachometer

An instrument that measures the speed of rotation of a wheel is called a tachometer. A new type of tachometer can measure the speeds of five different rotating machines. The rotational speed ranges from one to five thousand r.p.m. (revolutions per second) and can be read directly.

Radar "Policeman"

If a car's speed exceeds the prescribed rate, it will be punished. A new instrument, based on the principle of radar, can immediately indicate whether the speeding car in front has exceeded the prescribed rate, with a very accurate degree of accuracy, with only a two percent error. The instrument weighs forty-five pounds and requires only a six-volt storage battery or a one-hundred-and-twenty-volt alternating current to control it.

New Magnet

The Soviet Union has invented a new magnetic alloy that is said to be able to hold three hundred times its weight in iron blocks. It is tentatively named Magnet Gold 627, and it is extracted from oil wells more than four thousand nine hundred feet deep.

All-Steel Motor

American Elliott Co. recently manufactured an all-steel welded large motor that is not only extremely strong but also very refined and compact, reducing one-tenth of the weight and one-quarter of the volume. The efficiency of the cooling equipment is also extremely high. The bracket and body of the all-steel motor are coated with stainless steel, which is bright.

Leakage Control Device for Underground Metals

According to recent studies, corrosion of underground metals is caused by electrolysis due to the passage of current. To prevent this corrosion, a new design is about to be completed. At the same time, if there is a leakage of electricity on the wire, it is often dangerous. This new instrument, including sensitive current and voltage components, can allow the leakage to escape without danger.

### Rocket Fuel

— Kai

There are two main types of rocket fuel: solid fuel and liquid fuel. The former is nothing more than ordinary smokeless gunpowder, which is not easy to control and requires a very large combustion chamber, making it unsuitable for rockets. Therefore, current research on rocket fuel is focused on liquid fuel. Of course, everyone believes that the most ideal driving force—atomic energy—is also the best fuel for rockets, but it is still far from practical application, so let's not discuss it for now. Therefore, this article will focus on introducing some liquid fuels for rockets.

Before getting to the main topic, let's first talk about what is the most suitable fuel for rockets. We know that the movement of a rocket is due to the reaction force generated by the gas being ejected backward at extremely high speeds. According to Newton's laws of mechanics, the force on the rocket is: F = MC, where M is the mass of the gas ejected per unit time, and C is the speed at which the gas is ejected. However, a rocket has a limited amount of fuel, so the quality of the fuel depends on the speed at which the gas is ejected from the fuel. At the same time, we should also know that the temperature of the rocket's combustion chamber reaches as high as six thousand degrees Fahrenheit. Under this high temperature, many situations and chemical changes are very different from normal. We must relearn many things.

For example, at room temperature, the power produced by burning liquid oxygen and gasoline together is greater than that of liquid oxygen and alcohol. However, in the high temperature of the rocket's combustion chamber, the opposite is true. Therefore, the German V-2 rocket used the latter two fuels.

At high temperatures, decomposition (Dissociation) occurs, which hinders the combustion of the fuel. If the combustion is not complete, it will affect the pressure and ejection speed of the gas. Compounds containing oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen, such as alcohol, generate gas at six thousand degrees Fahrenheit. According to calculations and experimental results, the maximum speed is only eight thousand feet per second, which of course cannot meet our requirements.

Targeting this phenomenon, American scientists used liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, which have higher binding power. Sure enough, this increased the ejection speed to twelve thousand feet per second. However, according to common chemical knowledge, we know that oxygen and fluorine have a strong binding force. They can quickly synthesize hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the dark at low temperatures, and they are not easily separated at high temperatures. Scientists thought of it, believing that if liquid fluorine and hydrogen were used as fuel, better results could be obtained. At the same time, there is another factor that makes liquid fluorine and hydrogen more suitable as rocket fuel than oxygen and hydrogen, which is specific gravity.

Rockets have a huge volume, of which fuel accounts for three-quarters, so for economic reasons, it is more appropriate to carry fuel with a higher specific gravity. Based on this principle, we can calculate:

Each part of oxygen must be combined with two parts of hydrogen to synthesize one part of water, and the atomic weight of oxygen is sixteen, while hydrogen is one, so if liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are used as fuel, then the weight of the oxygen carried is heavier than hydrogen, which should be eight to one. Similarly, if liquid fluorine and liquid hydrogen are used as fuel, then the fluorine is nine times heavier than hydrogen. Everyone knows that oxygen is the lightest, so liquid fluorine and hydrogen are heavier fuels, that is, if liquid fluorine and liquid oxygen are used as fuel, the volume of the rocket can be reduced a lot, which is what we most hope for.

However, the difficult part is that fluorine is not easily extracted, which needs to be overcome. American scientists are currently working hard to study this issue.

### Climbing Perch and Archerfish

— Yu

These two strange fish – climbing perch and archerfish – are produced in India.

The climbing perch has a pair of hard fins on its chest. By moving these fins in an alternating motion, it can climb up trees step by step in a stable posture. This fish can not only climb back and forth on tree trunks hanging over the water, but also rely on that pair of transformed fins to wade across areas far from the water surface.

The archerfish is about the same size as the climbing perch and is a freshwater fish. It has a force that allows it to contract and expand its mouth and throat. It usually swims along the shore with its mouth full of water. When it sees a fly basking in the sun on the branches and leaves, it immediately exposes its mouth to the surface of the water and, with its mouth swollen, shoots the water upwards.

Its mouth is like a water gun, and it shoots the water straight out when people are unprepared. Its sniping skills are so high that unless it doesn't see you, no one can escape if it does see you.

The archerfish has a flat body, like a small plate, and a triangular head. It has sharp eyesight and a powerful sniping force, and can sometimes shoot down spiders that are stretched on cobwebs several feet above the water.

### Morning Glory

— Jialing

The morning glory is not a famous flower, and it has no alluring fragrance, so it has never been valued by people. However, if you observe it carefully, it is not difficult to find its beauty - the neat trumpet-shaped corolla, the ever-leftward winding vines, and the extremely clever posture. Shao Yong, a poet of the Song Dynasty, loved the morning glory very much, "The host凝伫looks, always ignoring court duties". He would get up early in the autumn morning to admire the morning glories with dewdrops in the clear air.

Eliminate Wind Toxins and Promote Urination

The morning glory is commonly called the trumpet flower, but in fact, the万萝 and purple jasmine also have trumpet flowers. Why is it called morning glory? According to the 本草 (herbology book): "This medicine first appeared, and the farmers thanked the deities for leading the cattle, so it was named after it." The seeds of the morning glory have medicinal value, and in traditional Chinese medicine, they are used to dispel wind toxins and promote urination.

Autumn is a rare time for flowers to bloom, leisurely guiding the morning glory up the short wall.

A long and tough vine is the characteristic of the morning glory. You can use it to make many interesting things: sow the seeds in a long charcoal basket, and soon the entire basket will be covered with luxuriant growth, with beautiful flowers blooming from the messy basket, full of antique charm. If we plant a row of morning glories on the ground, and use a stick for each plant to climb, it will soon grow into a natural fresh flower curtain.

Why Always Rotate Leftward

The vine of the morning glory always rotates leftward (counterclockwise). We have no way to make it rotate rightward.

Its leftward rotation is of course because the growth on the side of the vine that is closest to the supporting object is slower than the growth on the outside. Since there is a leftward-rotating morning glory, then a rightward-rotating one is also possible. Why can't we ever find a rightward-rotating one? Is it that leftward rotation is better than rightward rotation? Only the creator knows.

The morning glory is an annual plant. After the seeds have fallen, the stems and leaves gradually wither, and the vines on the fence gradually rot, becoming brittle and disappearing. Fortunately, the seeds have been left behind, and next year in the autumn wind and dawn mist, it can once again display its beautiful姿.

### Looking Forward to the Scientific World (Continued)

— Gangren

Perhaps small transmitters, transmitters, and receivers will be as lightweight and sophisticated as today's pens, allowing people to carry them around, saving a lot of gasoline, shoes, and postage, conveniently communicating with each other, and saving the most precious time.

In the realm of biological chemistry, industry will have greater achievements. Humans lacking protein will eat a kind of "steak" that is (discovered by Auhensen Busch). Is the nutritious food we feed livestock a product of wood waste? And will our descendants drink drinking water containing fluorine and obtain teeth that will never decay?

The greatest success, perhaps the most exciting work in science in the future, is to use the "photosynthetic effect" to absorb the energy sent by the sun to the earth to produce sugars, starches, proteins, and fats, and other essential human needs.

Perhaps those scientists who are working hard, such as Dr. Eugene Rabinowitch of the University of Illinois, will bring various new foods to mankind and create a brilliant new era for this world that is often short of supplies!

In short, mankind is gradually becoming the master of nature!

### The Most Profitable Investment: Scientific Research

— Nifu

We can easily guess that the most profitable investment in an industrialized country like the United States must be in the development of industry; otherwise, because it is a so-called monetary empire, mining gold mines should be the most profitable. In fact, this is not the case. In the United States, the most profitable investment is actually in research on how to obtain more and better breeds of pigs, grains, or other agricultural products. According to Dr. W. V. Lambrt, Chairman of the Agricultural Research Committee of the US Department of Agriculture, the money the government spends on research to improve products and improve varieties in agricultural programs has now received a hundredfold return.

In recent decades, the scientific research expenses used for a few agricultural problems are only tens of millions of dollars, but the return obtained is nearly 25 billion US dollars. This does not include income from fields.

Here are some records declared by Mr. Lambert regarding agricultural research:

Hybrid Com - spent 10 million US dollars in research, and after a period of 30 years, now the annual income has increased by 75 million US dollars.

DDT - Only spent 50,000 US dollars in research. After cows are treated with DDT, they can avoid the sting of cow flies and obtain better products, so they can get 10 million US dollars of profit every year, and this number will even increase to 100 million US dollars.

Phenothiazine - This chemical medicine can eliminate parasites in livestock. The research cost is only 10,000 US dollars, but farmers can save on livestock feed and grow faster, and they can get back 10 million US dollars every year.

Other agricultural research "annual income" includes research on various grains and sugar harvests and preservation methods, which can therefore generate 100 million US dollars per year. Furthermore, due to gradual experience gained from improvements, the annual income can be increased by 500 million US dollars.

Dr. Lambert pointed out that agricultural science has made great contributions to human survival. It has found a way to produce Peniclilin in large quantities and is moving towards the future of how to provide nutrition to mankind.

At present, the international situation is becoming increasingly tense. The author believes that if American scientists can use the results of research on atomic energy to make atomic energy the source of all power in the world, then its benefits to the United States itself and the happiness of all mankind will be a thousand times greater than the contribution of agricultural science research. However, if we only devote ourselves to the manufacture of atomic bombs and toxic bacteria that reduce human warfare, then what is the use of producing large quantities of Penicillin and trying to supply human nutrition at the same time? The relationship between scientific research and human happiness and harm depends only on the difference in the thoughts of scientists. Scientists should know what to engage in!

Finally, the most profitable investment has been proven to be scientific research in the United States. Our Chinese entrepreneurs should know this for reference.

### New Student Deferment Measures: Reply from the Civil Affairs Office

Re: Your Department's letter of September 12th, stating that university freshmen who have been admitted have obtained certificates for applying for deferment reasons, and various levels of personnel have made things difficult for them when they presented their certificates to the district Baojia offices for processing. Please order each district to comply and handle the matter in order to maintain their studies, etc.

Upon approval, it is found that university freshmen who have been admitted, such as those who have registered and are studying at school, may submit a certificate of study at the school and apply directly to this office for deferment. There is no need for the district Baojia to review and approve the application. The preceding paragraphs of the letter are hereby replied to, in the hope that you will investigate and act accordingly!

Sincerely,

To: Social Services Department of the Shenbao Newspaper Editorial Department

From: Civil Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government. September.

The more income, the heavier the tax

Dear Editor:

I work in a certain wharf warehouse, and the treatment is harsh. Until last month, due to repeated negotiations, it was calculated according to the cost of living index, but when the salary was paid, 4.5% of the salary income tax was deducted, that is, 45,000 yuan was deducted for every million yuan. Now I have the following two points, and I hope you will answer them in detail, I look forward to it very much.

What is the government's stipulated salary income tax that should be levied?

Are the tax rates the same for high and low base salaries?

(My monthly salary is 60 yuan, calculated according to the workers' index)

Sincerely, Zhang Zizhong

[This answer] The salary income tax stipulated by the government is levied separately according to the amount of total income. According to the income tax rate of the second frequency A item of the income tax, the income between 800,000 yuan and 1.1 million yuan should be calculated at a tax rate of 10%. If 45,000 yuan is deducted for every million yuan, there is nothing wrong with it.

The tax amount levied is calculated according to the total salary income, not according to the level of the base salary. The more income, the greater the tax burden.

### Fujian Association in Shanghai Awards Scholarships

The Fujian Association in Shanghai is holding scholarships this year. For the first Ronglu Public Scholarship, 27 people passed the examination. Now the association is holding the second Ciqing Scholarship, with a quota of 30 people. Each person will be awarded all tuition fees.
