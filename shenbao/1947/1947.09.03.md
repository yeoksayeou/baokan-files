### Heavy Fighting in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area; National Army Recovers Shangcheng and Songbu; Future Military Focus Will Be in the Northeast

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi attended the Political Affairs Conference on the 2nd and reported on military affairs, stating that: Some people are currently very concerned about the war in the Henan-Hubei border area, but although the bandit army of Liu Bocheng's forces is rampant, it is not as serious as rumored. The future war situation will be determined in the Northeast. After the fighting in central Shandong and the Henan-Hubei area comes to an end, troops will be moved north. Minister Bai reported with great confidence in the war situation.

[United Press Nanjing, 2nd] Liu Bocheng's remnants now number only 20,000, divided into several small teams of about 1,000 to 2,000 men each, scattered in the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, from Xuanhuadian in the west to Lihuang in the east, and from Shangcheng in the north to Songbu in the south. According to National Army observers, Liu Bocheng's fleeing troops have traveled 330 miles south across the Longhai Railway since August 11th. Although they looted a lot of supplies, they did not pose a major threat to the National Army. They believe that this fleeing communist general will no longer be able to escape the encirclement without suffering heavy blows as he has in the past. However, he may cause significant disasters to the local area before being driven out.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 2nd] The war in the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei border area has entered a new stage of going into the mountains to fight. The National Army is dividing into three routes to pursue and suppress in the mountainous area. On the morning of the 2nd, Shangcheng was recovered, and they continued to advance south. The National Army that captured Guangshan had cleared the remaining bandits in the urban area on the 1st. The main force of the remnants of Liu's 1st and 7th columns was surrounded by the National Army in the Lianhuachi area (south of Luoshan) on the 1st and is being annihilated. The National Army has increased its forces in the Yejiaji and Lihuang area, and the fighting is fierce.

[Our Newspaper Hankou, 2nd] Liu's 2nd and 6th columns, which were causing trouble in Songbu, fought fiercely with the National Army for a day. In order to lure the enemy deep, they once moved to a predetermined position. After being severely attacked head-on, Songbu was recovered at noon on the 2nd. In this battle, the bandits suffered several times more casualties than the National Army. A force of more than a thousand remnants of Liu's 3rd column fled to Yejiaji, north of Lihuang, on the 1st, and a force of two thousand fled to Songbu on the same day. Both were driven away by the National Army and are now fleeing towards Songzisi. Liu's independent column is currently building fortifications in the Yangjiaqiao area north of Xuanhuadian, attempting to resist stubbornly. The National Army is currently attacking from the southwest and both sides.

[Our Newspaper Bengbu, 2nd] The communist bandits continue to flee towards the Dabie Mountains. The western route invaded Lishan and was intercepted by the National Army at Dashengguan and Xuanhuadian, suffering considerable losses. The central route attacked Macheng, and Huang'an was also under pressure. Reinforcements from Huangpi are rushing towards Huang'an, and there will be fierce fighting between Huang'an and Macheng. The bandits on the eastern route who reached the vicinity of Lihuang were blocked on the highway. Lihuang is firmly defended. It is very obvious that the bandits plan to flee into the Yinghuo Mountains between Hubei and Anhui.

[Our Newspaper Hefei, 2nd] Three to four thousand communist bandits who fled from Shangcheng to Lihuang were still fighting fiercely with the National Army on the 2nd. Another force of more than a thousand people took the opportunity to flee east into the territory of Liu'an. A strong National Army force has gone to block and suppress them.

### National Flag Flying High at the Northeast Headquarters; Chief Chen Also Assumed Office Yesterday; Convened a Meeting of Generals in Shenyang That Evening

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 2nd] The national flag was flying high in front of the Northeast Headquarters on the 2nd. At 10:00 AM, Chief Chen Also led Chu Xichun, Che Fanru, and others to the headquarters. Deputy Chief Zheng Dongguo and other military officers lined up at the gate to welcome them. Chen entered the headquarters amidst music. After ascending the stairs, Xiong Shihui greeted him outside the office. After a brief handover in the room, they went to the auditorium, where military personnel, provincial and municipal chairmen, mayors, and other civil and military officials were waiting to be instructed.

Xiong and Chen took the stage. Xiong first delivered a speech, saying: "I am grateful for the cooperation of Commander Du, Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, local elders, civil and military officials over the past two years. The previous fall of the Northeast was not only a disgrace to the Northeast, but also a disgrace to China. Today, the Northeast is in a state of semi-fall, which is a disaster for the Northeast and China. I will never forget the complete recovery of the Northeast and will help to complete this task directly and indirectly in the future. Now that Chief Chen has come to concurrently serve as the director of the Northeast Headquarters, it will further strengthen the overall recovery and stability of the Northeast. At the same time, it is also a major proof that the central government attaches great importance to the Northeast. What I have accomplished in ten years can be accomplished by Chen in one year, and everything can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Finally, I wish you all success in your work, and Chief Chen success."

Chen then delivered a speech, saying: "Director Xiong has repeatedly requested to resign, and the central government has sent me to concurrently serve. I am determined to continue Director Xiong's work to complete the task. At the same time, we must not forget the hardships that Director Xiong has endured since the beginning of receiving the Northeast and over the past two years. Let us work together. The Northeast issue is an issue of the entire country and international security. Everyone must work hard. Not only is this necessary, but it also has its value for effort." After the speeches, photos were taken, and Xiong was sent out of the headquarters. Chen then began to work, first summoning Zheng Dongguo and the chief and deputy chiefs of staff to inquire and instruct. Then, he reviewed official documents and met with administrative personnel, and did not leave the headquarters until after noon. Northeast elders Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuhan attended Chen's inauguration ceremony as members of the Political Committee, and Chen treated them with great courtesy.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 2nd] At 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, various circles held a farewell reception for Xiong and welcomed Chen. Chen shook hands with the participants with a smile, paying attention to the introductions. Regarding the questions raised by reporters, he said that he could only hand in a blank paper. Xiong said that he would fly to Beiping within days.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 2nd] Chief Chen concurrently taking charge of the military and political affairs of the Northeast has brought clarity to the long-stagnant situation in the Northeast. The military has been busy planning in recent days, indicating that the situation will take a sharp turn for the better. It is generally predicted that the National Army will soon take the initiative to attack, possibly first clearing the bandit traces in southern Liaoning and the Andong Meihekou area, and then advancing northward to recover northern Songhua. Last night, Chen convened a meeting of generals here at the Second Guest House of the Headquarters, which did not break up until late at night. In addition, transportation on the Beining Road is frequent, all in preparation for the National Army's counterattack.

Chen first stated that in order to implement the original intention of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction and to relieve the people's suffering, the central government had no choice but to order the mobilization of the whole country to step up the suppression of the rebellion. Therefore, the primary task of the headquarters in the future is to implement the government's policy of suppressing bandits. Secondly, he stated that it is appropriate to abandon extravagance and advocate frugality in time to reverse the declining trend. As for military discipline, it should be thoroughly rectified. If there are any violations of the law or harassment, they will be severely punished. At the same time, we should each be in our respective positions and perform our duties, seeking ways to self-reliance in the midst of difficulties.

### Commemorating September 3rd and Welcoming the Head of State; A Grand Gathering Will Be Held in Lushan Today; The Chairman Will Personally Attend and Give Instructions

[Our Newspaper Guling, 2nd] The Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of Japan's Surrender on September 3rd and the Guling All Circles Welcome Chairman Chiang's Visit to the Mountain Conference will be held jointly on the morning of the 3rd. At that time, the Chairman may personally participate and give instructions. If he cannot attend due to official duties, Wang Lingji will attend on his behalf.

[Our Newspaper Guling, 2nd] Guling was still shrouded in heavy fog all day on the 2nd, a white expanse. The bizarre valleys and beautiful peaks were all hidden from view, and the pedestrians on the streets had a feeling of ascending to immortality. Chairman Chiang and his wife toured Huanglong at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, visiting the famous Lushan man-made forest in Jiangnan, and then had a picnic at the Huanglong Temple in the deep green mountains before returning at dusk.

[Our Newspaper Hankou, 2nd] Local newspapers report that Chairman Chiang will fly to Hankou before returning to Nanjing, according to a special dispatch from Guling.

### Question of Opening Dalian Port; Rumor that the Soviet Union Rejected the US Protest

[United Press Washington, 1st] According to usually well-informed sources, it is learned that the Soviet Union has rejected the US protest regarding the Soviet Union's refusal to open Dalian Port for international commerce.

Well-informed sources did not disclose the reasons for the Soviet Union's rejection, only saying that US officials have been notified that the Soviet Union is still unwilling to be forced to hand over Dalian to Chinese administration and does not want to open it as an international commercial port before signing a peace treaty with Japan. The most recent US protest on the Dalian issue was delivered to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on August 14. A protest was also lodged on January 3 this year. In its August 14 protest, the United States stated that "Dalian should be opened as an international free commercial port in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945." We now believe that there is no reason to delay its opening any longer, as the treaty only stipulates that the Soviet Union has the right to exercise military control over the port during wartime. The United States now believes that the war ended two years ago, but the Soviet Union insists that the war cannot be said to have ended until a peace treaty with Japan is signed.

In addition to protesting the Soviet occupation of Dalian, US officials also believe that the terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty are not clear in wording. Although the treaty stipulates that Dalian must be handed over to the Chinese administrative authorities after the end of the war, it also stipulates that China must recognize the Soviet Union's "supreme rights" to interests in Dalian, so that two years after Japan's surrender to China, it has not yet been handed over to China.

Official sources commented that the Soviet Union's position is that the Dalian issue is purely a matter concerning China and the Soviet Union, but the United States, in view of Dalian's interests to the United States and the world, still insists that it should be opened as a commercial port. Officials are currently studying the Soviet Union's position. No final decision has been made on the steps to be taken. The United States and the Soviet Union have repeatedly argued over the Dalian issue in the past year. The Soviet Union had previously allowed US ships to sail to Dalian to deliver mail and supplies to the US consul there, but in March of this year, this was prohibited, and they were no longer allowed to enter the port. The above-mentioned supplies are now delivered to the US consul general there by Soviet ships.

### National Army in Northern Jilin Launches Attacks from Wula Street on Two Routes

[Central News Agency Jilin, 2nd] The National Army in the northern Jilin area recently launched attacks from Wula Street on two routes, north and east, and is advancing forward.

### China's Tin, Antimony, and Tungsten Ore Repayments; US Listed as National Strategic Reserves

[United Press Washington, 1st] Chinese tin, antimony, and tungsten ores have now been listed as US military strategic reserves. The Treasury Department's Federal Supply Bureau and the Army and Navy Ordnance Bureaus are absorbing these special qualities from all over the world. Current inventory and from which countries they are purchased are military secrets and not known, but it is heard that China is one of the exporting countries. These strategic raw materials are currently used by China to repay part of its debt to the United States. The Export-Import Bank's total loans to China amount to 70 million US dollars, stipulated to be repaid by China in metal in the future, and are therefore called "metal loans." The loan agreement was signed in 1940 and will expire next year. According to the bank, China is quite capable of fulfilling the agreement. The rumor circulating in China that Chinese tungsten production is being purchased entirely by the Soviet Union at inflated prices in cash is considered inaccurate here. According to the Metal Reserve Bureau of the Construction Finance Corporation: "No Chinese tungsten has been shipped this year, and we don't need it. The United States does not lack tungsten reserves, so it only purchases antimony from China." The US government does not disclose the amount of tungsten it stores, but other sources believe that a considerable amount of tungsten is being shipped to the Soviet Union. According to a retired official who was stationed in China during the war: "Between 1938 and 1939, the Chinese government concluded a barter agreement with the Soviet Union. China obtained military supplies from the Soviet Union, and China supplied the Soviet Union with metals. The detailed contents of this agreement have not been published, but there is no doubt that the Soviet Union obtained a large part of the metal produced in China through this agreement."

[Our Newspaper Hankou, 2nd] Martial law was officially announced here starting on the 2nd. Except for those with special permits, no one is allowed to pass through at night, but the general public believes that Liu's bandits will be severely hit, so people are calm and the market has not fluctuated significantly.

### Mongolian Army Attempts to Invade the Main Peak of Beitashan

[Central News Agency Beitashan, 1st] It is very obvious that the Outer Mongolian army has been increasing its troops to Beitashan in recent days, attempting to gradually move its main force towards Da Xiaosongshu, in order to take the opportunity to attack the main peak of Beitashan, Alter Naoba. The peak is 1,845 meters high, located in the wing of our army's position, Hujuerte, commanding a strategic position. For half a month, the peak has been covered with white snow, and the temperature is between five and six degrees, freezing in an instant. When the mountains are sealed by heavy snow, it is not a place for military operations, so the Mongolian army's attempt was expected by our army.

### Liao Yaoxiang and Others Assume Office

### Overseas Foreign Exchange Assets of Chinese Citizens Should be Automatically Declared and Registered; Ministry of Finance Formulates Regulations to be Submitted to the Full Economic Committee for Discussion

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the regulations on the declaration and registration of overseas foreign exchange assets of Chinese citizens, the Ministry of Finance has made a concrete decision and will submit it to the Full Economic Committee for discussion. The main content of the regulations is that Chinese citizens should automatically declare their overseas foreign exchange assets and transfer them to the Central Bank. This matter does not mean that the overseas foreign exchange assets will be frozen. If there are needs such as medical treatment and travel, they can still be used. Those who do not declare will be severely punished. According to authoritative sources, the claim made by Wei Demai that Chinese assets in the United States amount to 1.5 billion refers to "assets." Since there are so many overseas Chinese in the United States, 1.5 billion in assets should not be too much.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the investigation of the implementation of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee to use overseas deposits of Chinese citizens, the Control Yuan previously made a resolution, and recently assigned several supervisors to go to the Ministry of Finance and other relevant agencies to investigate thoroughly, and it will be clarified soon.

To be Directly Under the Ministry of National Defense

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 2nd] Military authorities have decided to expand the Beiping Garrison Headquarters into the Beiping Garrison General Headquarters.

### Our Delegation to Japan's Name: Allied Headquarters Deems Non-Compliant; Trade Guidance Council Cables Ambassador Koo to Explain to the U.S.; National Federation of Commerce and Industry Opposes Opening Trade with Japan

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] The Trade Guidance Council for Japan held another meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd to discuss the following important issues: (1) Zhang Tianheng and Tian Heqing, representatives from the National Federation of Commerce and Industry and the Industrial Association, attended the meeting and stated that both associations agreed to send representatives to Japan for observation and investigation, but opposed sending people to Japan for business; at the same time, they did not agree to open trade with Japan, believing that it would provide an opportunity for Japanese goods to be dumped. During the meeting, it was explained that sending personnel to Japan for observation was inconsistent with the regulations of the Allied forces. As for the dumping of Japanese goods, our import restrictions are extremely strict, and it will not affect our industry. Finally, it was hoped that both groups could send representatives to Japan. (2) Koo Vi-kyuin, our ambassador to the United States, telegraphed, stating that the U.S. side believed that the name "delegation" was inconsistent with the original regulations. The meeting decided that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should inform Ambassador Koo that the term "delegation" was used internally for guidance purposes, while externally, individuals would still act in their personal capacity. The U.S. side also had doubts about our dispatch of representatives from public and joint ventures. The meeting also requested Ambassador Koo to explain that public and joint ventures had private capital but were enterprise companies, no different from ordinary companies. (3) Some industrial and commercial associations requested that Japanese *seed species be prohibited from being transported to Taiwan, not to Jiangnan. It would be acceptable if these materials were not imported, and it would be better if domestic supply was possible. However, this matter must be determined based on climate and other conditions. It was resolved that this matter be referred to the silk association guidance council for discussion. (4) Regarding the import of rayon, some people did not advocate the import of rayon but advocated importing raw silk. However, others believed that rayon was needed for silk reeling. Finally, it was decided to proceed roughly according to the original method. In addition, the nominees for the delegation to Japan have been internally determined by the China Trust Bureau, China Salt Company, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, etc., while other aspects have not yet been finalized.

According to the resolution of the State Council, the outline and implementation measures for economizing consumption were originally scheduled to be announced and implemented simultaneously on September 1st. Zhai believed that the outline included too many departments, and the competent departments should formulate implementation measures based on their respective businesses, which would then be reviewed by the Executive Yuan. However, there were many overlapping conflicts in the various implementation measures. At last week's routine meeting, the Executive Yuan appointed Wang Yunwu, Jiang Gouchen, Yang Liangjun, Zheng Zhenwen, Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Qitian, and others to form a special review committee, convened by Wang Yunwu. The review committee held two meetings on August 29th and 30th, and completed the review of 13 types of measures. Ten types remained to be reviewed this week, resulting in only the outline being announced on September 1st, and the implementation measures could not be announced, thus delaying the implementation of economizing consumption.

At the meeting on the 2nd, President Zhang presided over the meeting. After the foreign affairs and national defense reports, the reviewed implementation measures were submitted for discussion. The committee members spoke one after another, believing that 23 types of implementation measures were too many, and the measures themselves could not economize, which was not a good strategy. It was finally decided to resubmit them for review to strive for simplicity and clarity to facilitate implementation. The review committee on the 3rd was decided to be convened by Secretary-General Gan Naiguang to study with the vice-ministers of various departments.

### Thirteen Types of Review Completed

### Zhonghe Bridge Massacre in Beijing Sentenced, Main Culprit Adore Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Rooks Requesting Washington for Review

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] Rooks, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, received reporters at 12:30 on the 2nd and announced the verdict on Adore, the main culprit in the Zhonghe Bridge massacre. Rooks first read the original text of Articles 92 and 93 of the U.S. military law, and then read the main text of the judgment, stating: "Forfeit all salaries and allowances after the crime, and dishonorably discharge him, sentencing him to life imprisonment." He then announced that the military court's trial concluded: Corporal Adore was tried on charges of murdering Ge Fatian and Wang Diben at Zhonghe Bridge on the night of August 1. The trial of the court believes that the Ge Fatian part is guilty of murder under Article 91 of the military law, and the Wang Shouben part is guilty of manslaughter under Article 93 of the military law, not murder, so the above judgment is made. It is said that after Wang Shouben was put into the water, the perpetrator should have known that his actions were murder, but he continued to do so. Afterwards, he called the airport military police in an attempt to cover up, which was obviously murder of Ge Fatian. Rooks believed that this judgment was very appropriate and had been approved, and was submitted to the Pentagon in Washington for review. If the Pentagon also approves it, the case will be concluded, otherwise President Truman will make the final decision. It is reported that this judgment will also be sent to our relevant agencies.

### Internal Drafted Measures to Prohibit Dancing, Political Committee Believes Too Broad, Argues to Order by Decree During Discussion

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] According to the provisions of the Outline for the Implementation of Economizing Consumption, commercial dancing will be prohibited. The Interior Ministry has drafted implementation measures accordingly. When submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion on the 2nd, the committee members believed that the measures were too broad. If implemented according to these measures, some dances would be protected by the law, and those who did not dance would also start dancing. Some committee members argued that the ban on dancing could be ordered by decree, without the need to formulate separate measures. No conclusion was reached on this matter at the meeting and will be submitted to the review committee for joint review on the 3rd. It is reported that the original measures drafted by the Interior Ministry stipulated that commercial dance halls refer to places that set up music, have dance floors, and sell dance tickets or admission tickets, etc., exclusively for people to enter and dance with dance girls or dance partners. Coffee shops, restaurants, music halls, tea houses, bars, hotels, and other places that also operate commercial dancing are considered commercial dance halls. Commercial dance halls should be ordered to close within a time limit by the local government, but all should be closed within three months. Those who violate the rules will be sealed by the local government. Before closing down, dance halls should shorten their daily business hours and close down in stages. As for the steps and methods, the local governments should consider the actual situation and draft them in advance to report to the Interior Ministry for verification. Those who have not set up commercial dance halls shall not be established in the future, and those who are currently preparing to do so shall be ordered to stop immediately.

Editorial

### Reflections on Two Years of Victory — Also a Response to the Doubts of the Da Mei Evening News —

Two years ago today, the Chief of Staff of the former Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, Yoshijiro Umezu, and the representative of the Japanese government, Mamoru Shigemitsu, formally signed the Japanese surrender document to the Allied forces on the deck of the American battleship 'Missouri' in Tokyo Bay, marking a pivotal moment in human history. From the day Japan formally surrendered, a cruel war ended in human history, and a bright and splendid new page should have been turned. However, on this anniversary two years later, we don't even seem to have the mood to "force a smile."

Why is this? Half of it is our own lack of effort; half is the fading of circumstances. The friends who shared hardships during the war seem to have blurred the lines between enemies and friends. As a result, the former enemy is complacent and eager to try again; while the former allies criticize each other, or even go their separate ways!

I remember last year today, although defeated Japan was struggling to recover, it was still under the control of the Allied forces and had no hope of turning over and rising again. General MacArthur issued a statement that day, saying that "the world is shrouded in the shadow of suspicion and uneasiness due to the erosion of harmful ideas; if this kind of thinking is allowed to spread without restriction, individual freedom will be wiped out. What position will Japan occupy in the world in the future? Will it be a fortress of peace? Or will it become a springboard for war?" It can be seen that General MacArthur still had doubts about the future of Japan at that time, but as of today, everything in Japan seems to have changed greatly: not only in the consciousness of the Japanese people, they have almost ceased to recognize themselves as a defeated country, but they have probably also forgotten the scene of the Japanese representatives signing the surrender document on the American warship, and regard the United States as their savior! Although the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, private foreign trade in Japan has been reopened on August 15; the issue of compensation seems to have been shelved. It is no wonder that the Japanese are so ecstatic that their ambitions of aggression are secretly trying to revive. According to foreign news agency reports, Japan intends to make three demands to the future peace conference with Japan: (1) jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States; (2) obtain special immigration rights to Taiwan; (3) obtain fishing rights in Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. Just from this matter, the arrogance of the Japanese can be seen without saying.

How could defeated Japan become so arrogant in just two short years? On the one hand, it is indeed because General MacArthur and his colleagues were inevitably blinded by the Japanese fox-like policies, and became gentlemen who were "easily deceived by their methods," thinking that this former Eastern enemy could be a docile servant, and no longer considering the consequences of their excessive tolerance. But on the other hand, we cannot help but deeply blame ourselves. Why did we waste two years of good time, letting China be consumed in the turmoil woven by "peace talks" and war? At the same time, why didn't we start by rectifying officialdom and suppressing rebellion at the same time, working hard to move forward, in order to lay the foundation for a peaceful, unified, and powerful new China, causing us to be ridiculed by friendly countries and laughed at by enemies? According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, the US authorities plan to set the US-Japan exchange rate at one dollar to 130 yen. Based on this calculation, the Japanese yen, which was less than one yuan of our country's legal tender before the war, is now worth 300 yuan of our country's legal tender. Is it not a strange thing in the world that the currency of the victorious country is not as valuable as that of the defeated country? This is really worthy of our painful reflection as self-proclaimed victors!

However, today's world, whether peace or war, is obviously inseparable. Therefore, the evolution of the situation in the two years since Japan's surrender, in the Far East, especially in China, we should not only deeply reflect on ourselves and move towards actively saving ourselves, but also not allow anyone to ignore the adverse external influence of the reversal of the international situation on China. Our newspaper's editorial the day before yesterday, "What will the United States do to China?" The Da Mei Evening News published an editorial yesterday, asking back, "What will China do to help itself?" Our American colleagues said: As long as China can indeed do some self-help things, the United States will be happy to fulfill its part. The Da Mei Evening News also made it clear: "The work of the United States cannot be preliminary, but with the backing of appropriate Chinese self-help, it may eventually be a decisive work." We warmly welcome this frank expression from our allies, and dare to say that China has decided to embark on the road of "self-help" first. We must seize the fruits of victory, our people must eliminate all corrupt elements as much as possible, and we must also urge the government to work hard on various reforms to strengthen the administrative efficiency of political and economic facilities. This is the only way for the Chinese people to help themselves. Even without the advice of friends, the Chinese people will work hard to achieve it. However, at the same time, we must remind our American allies of two important points:

(1) The overall cause of the current situation in China is the eight years of protracted war and the rebellion of the CCP after the war. The Soviet Union intentionally aided the CCP rebellion, and the indecisive policy of the United States towards China indirectly delayed the government's policy of suppressing the communists, which was equivalent to condoning the CCP's growth. Both the Soviet Union and the United States were China's allies during the war, but they are now fighting each other!

(2) China must save itself and help itself, but after the war, just like the United Kingdom, it also hopes for the assistance of close friends. Like medical treatment, the most important thing is to be timely; otherwise, even if it is effective, it will be twice the effort with half the result. Before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, why did the National Government make such amazing progress? We should think of Lytton, who came to China in those years to help us establish a legal tender policy, which made the national construction advance rapidly and the strength of the Anti-Japanese War was also cultivated. Now, the vitality after the war is greatly damaged, and the value of the currency urgently needs to be stabilized. We must wait for the economy to be consolidated before all politics can get on track. If the American allies really intend to aid China, they should pay attention to the root cause of the disease. The urgency of the time is fleeting, and they must not hesitate to wait and see again.

In a word, who does the United States want to find as a friend in the East, the enemy of two years ago—Japan? Or the allied country that fought hard for eight years and shared weal and woe—China? We dare to say that Japan may look like a "loyal servant" today, but it may not be a rebellious and fierce servant in the future. Because if the Japanese people are not subject to long-term "re-education," they still dream of one day being the masters of the world and are unwilling to be servants forever. Only China is always determined to stand on an equal footing with the Allies as a trustworthy and loyal friend, neither having the ambition to be the master of the world, nor willing to bow down and make a "servant" on the surface to please friends!

### Our Rice Production Ranks First in the World

Reaching Over 44 Million Metric Tons Last Year

[Report from New York by the Central News Agency, 1st] According to the United Nations Statistical Monthly released today, China remains the leading country in world rice production.

### Pan-American Conference Concludes Successfully; Truman Delivers Closing Remarks; Stresses that the Threat of Aggression Still Exists; and Guarantees to Safeguard World Peace with Money and Military Force

[Report by this newspaper] Broadcast from San Francisco, 2nd: In his closing remarks at the Pan-American Conference, Truman stated: Most countries in Europe and Asia are currently under the threat of military aggression, and he guaranteed that the United States will fully safeguard world peace with military force and money. The United States is greatly disappointed with the post-war situation and must prepare for a long-term occupation of enemy territory. Many countries are still under the control of foreign forces. Although Truman did not directly specify the Soviet Union's foreign policy in Central and Southern Europe, there is no doubt to whom his words were directed. Mr. Truman said: "I do not believe that the current international disputes cannot be resolved without the use of force. We will do our best to avoid anything that would increase international tensions. We will continue to work to maintain lasting peace. We are determined to maintain our strength. Our avoidance of the use of force must not be misinterpreted as a lack of determination to abide by the obligations of the United Nations Charter, or to condone others from arbitrarily undermining the foundations of international peace. Our determination to maintain our military strength is precisely proof of our serious attitude towards our obligations. The United States is determined to do its best to provide economic assistance to countries that intend to help themselves. However, the economic resources of the United States are by no means inexhaustible, so I urge other countries in the New World to jointly assist the countries in the Old World. The countries in Europe and Asia that have been washed by war should have priority in obtaining economic assistance." Truman pointed out that the world powers have failed to reach a consensus on peace treaties with the defeated countries, so we have to consider extending the period of military occupation in the enemy countries. Mr. Truman repeatedly guaranteed that the United States will strengthen the United Nations organization to make it a more effective world peace organization. At the same time, he declared: "The United Nations is now encountering pressure. The task of the United States is to maintain peace, not to create peace."

### The Principles of the Potsdam Agreement Are Irrelevant to the Peace Conference with Japan; US State Department Studies the New Soviet Note

[Report from Washington by the Central News Agency, 1st] A US State Department official stated: The State Department is currently studying the new note that the Soviet Union gave to the United States yesterday. In the note, the Soviet Union still refuses to accept the United States' proposal to convene an 11-nation peace conference with Japan, and reiterates its past position, advocating that the convening of the peace conference and the drafting of the peace treaty should be in the hands of the Council of Foreign Ministers, as it should be when drafting the European peace treaty.

US officials also stated: State Department officials are studying the new note from the Soviet Union, wanting to find any "possibility" in it that can reconcile the differences between the US and the Soviet Union, and it is expected that a step may be taken by the end of this week. Judging from the Soviet Union's note, the Soviet Union believes that convening an 11-nation peace conference (composed of member states of the Far Eastern Commission) violates the Potsdam Agreement, but at the time of the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union had not yet fought against Japan, and China, one of the main countries fighting against Japan, did not participate in the Potsdam Conference. Therefore, the decisions of the Potsdam Conference only apply to the European peace conference. As for the peace treaty with Japan, it is a completely different issue. If the procedures stipulated in Potsdam apply to the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan, then the powers must check another new agreement on the issue of Japan, but in fact this agreement does not exist.

### Second Anniversary of Japan's Surrender; MacArthur Praises Japan's Successful Revival; Advocates that the Peace Treaty with Japan Should Strive to Be Generous and Fair

[Report from Tokyo by New Asia News Agency, 2nd] Today is the second anniversary of the Allied victory over Japan. MacArthur issued a commemorative message, stating briefly: It has been two years since Japan signed the surrender document. During this year, Japan has been able to faithfully fulfill its vows. The Allied military occupation of Japan focuses on moral value and is unprecedented in history, using justice as the basis for everything instead of force.

It has been decided that the peace treaty with Japan will be discussed at the preparatory meeting soon. At this meeting, it is necessary for us to adopt a generous and fair attitude. Furthermore, since Japan's surrender, with the guidance of the Allied forces and the assistance of the United States, it has gradually restored its devastated economy. Industrial production has now reached more than 45% of the pre-war standard, and its upward trend may continue in the future. However, if Japan is to become a self-reliant country in the future, it is absolutely necessary for the United Nations to revise its trade methods with Japan and prevent Japan from falling into economic isolation. If Japan after the signing of the peace treaty can stand on the same basis of freedom and peace as other countries in the international community and be given the opportunity to survive, then the democratic political model that has already sprouted in Japan will not threaten the world and will allow the Japanese people to obtain a normal and peaceful life).

### Trial of Yu Shengxiao Murder Case Opens in U.S. Military Court; Five Witnesses Testify to Malai's Disadvantage; Relevant Chinese Authorities Send Personnel to Observe; Defendant Arrives in Military Uniform and Claims Innocence

[Our Own Report] The sensational murder case of Yu Shengxiao, with the American Staff Sergeant Malai as the suspect, was brought to trial by the U.S. military advisory group in a military court organized on the third floor of the American Military Cemetery at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The court consisted of eleven U.S. military officers, with Colonel Palmer as the chairman. The other judges were Colonel Stanney, Colonel Kakobu, Lieutenant Colonel Lawson, Lieutenant Colonel Whitt, Lieutenant Colonel Shaw, Major Turrent, Major Smith, Major Little, Major Eggers, and Captain Boswell. The prosecutor was Captain Olney. The defendant had four defenders: two civilians, Borokin and Ms. Stobaugh, and two military personnel, Major Acheson and Captain Patrick. Those from relevant Chinese departments who attended the observation included Court President Cha Tingke, Judge Zhu Yuhuang, Prosecutors Ding Guojun and Cao Hong, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office Chen Guolian, Section Chiefs He Xingren and Xie Zhijian, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau Office Wei Jingmeng, and municipal government councilors. Defendant Malai, still in military uniform, sat on the right side of the court, accompanied by his defenders. The accomplice, Cheli, was escorted by Chinese judicial police to the waiting room in the morning. The wife of the deceased, Yu Shengxiao, Mrs. Lu, arrived with her children in the morning. A total of thirteen Chinese and foreign witnesses appeared in court for questioning.

The courtroom was dimly lit, with electric lights on even during the day. The eleven military judges sat facing outward, with the American military flag hanging behind them. The courtroom was guarded by military police both inside and out, and the atmosphere was solemn and quiet. At precisely 9:00 a.m., the prosecutor announced the cause of the case, and all the judges swore an oath and took their seats. The prosecutor first asked Malai if he was guilty, and Malai immediately stood up and declared his innocence. Then, the first witness, Major McLunn, was summoned. After raising his hand and swearing an oath, McLunn stated that before the bloody incident occurred, Malai told him that he had no money and had come to Shanghai to collect his salary. However, when he arrived at the cashier's office on Saturday, he stated that he had about ninety U.S. dollars. The second witness summoned was Younovitz, the owner of the New Lido Bar on Rue Airo. He said that Malai had visited the New Lido twice on August 1st, once in the early afternoon and once at 3:00 p.m. At this point, the defendant's defender, Borokin, strenuously cross-examined, trying in every way to get the witness to confirm that he had seen Malai on August 1st in order to exculpate Malai. Although the witness could not give a very precise time, he insisted on the meeting. He also said that he seemed to have seen Malai and Cheli enter the bar together, but because the impression was not deep, he could not be sure.

### Car Owner Polov Proves Malai and Cheli Were in the Same Car

After Younovitz left, the third witness summoned was Polov, the Russian car owner. Polov said that he had known Cheli for two years. On the morning of August 1st, Cheli came alone to borrow the car. At 4:30 p.m., Cheli drove away near the Cathay Hotel, saying he was with a friend and did not need the original driver. At 8:10 p.m. that evening, Cheli returned to the Cathay, paid 800,000 yuan as a reward, and asked Polov to first take his friend to the Broadway Mansions and then take him home. At that time, he had not noticed anything unusual about the car. Two days later, he discovered dried blood stains in the car and immediately reported it to the police. At this point, the judge asked if he could identify the friend of Cheli he had driven. Polov said "Of course" and immediately pointed to Malai in the defendant's seat. After the questioning was completed, it was past 12:30 p.m., and the court announced a recess until 1:30 p.m.

Studying the Map

The court reconvened promptly in the afternoon. Because of the hot weather and the lengthy questioning, the number of people in the audience decreased sharply, and those present called it a "fatigue trial." The fourth witness was U.S. Army Sergeant Ross, who had drawn a map of the crime scene after the incident. At the summons of the judge, Ross explained the method of drawing the map in front of the map. The judges, the prosecutor, and the defendant's defenders also stepped forward to study it together and found it satisfactory. Ross then left. At 2:05 p.m., the most important witness, Cheli, was summoned, and the entire court was energized. Cheli, wearing a green shirt and blue trousers, entered calmly, with a dull expression on his face. After entering the witness stand, the prosecutor solemnly asked him to raise his hand and swear an oath, and then began the long questioning that lasted two and a half hours.

Cheli Being Questioned

Cheli's attitude was still calm, and he answered every question, but he answered slowly and in a very low voice. He briefly stated that his acquaintance with Malai in the past was purely social in nature and there was no business relationship. Before August 1st, he had met Malai three times. As for Yu Shengxiao, he had met him at 9:30 a.m. on August 1st, when he entrusted him to exchange US$86 for legal tender. At 11:45 a.m., he met Yu again to hand over the legal tender. Then, the questioning turned to the murder case on August 1st. The prosecutor presented an important piece of evidence: Cheli's felt hat. It was said that when he went out in a car with Yu Shengxiao that day, Malai was wearing civilian clothes and borrowed Cheli's hat. Cheli admitted in court that the felt hat was his, and that Malai borrowed it in the afternoon and returned it at 7:20 p.m. That evening. At this time, the defendant's defender examined the felt hat and remained silent.

"Don't Kill Me, Don't Kill Me"

At this point, the prosecutor then asked in detail about the scene of the bloody incident, and Cheli's answers were roughly the same as those he had provided in our court. According to him, he was driving and sitting in the front seat, while Malai and Yu Shengxiao were sitting in the back seat. In the middle of the journey, he suddenly heard a gunshot, followed by Yu shouting, "Don't kill me, don't kill me! I'll give you everything!" But Malai eventually shot Yu dead, pushed him out of the car, and ordered Cheli to return to the city along the original route. At this time, the judges and prosecutors carefully checked the map in detail, and the prosecutor repeatedly questioned the road surface and the trees on both sides to seek verification. At 4:20 p.m., the questioning was completed, and Colonel Palmer announced a recess and that the trial would resume at 9:00 a.m. this morning.

Eight Witnesses to Be Questioned Today

After the court opens this morning, eight more witnesses will continue to be questioned, and then the final debate will be held. The court will then announce the adjournment. The judges will hold a secret vote to determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. If he is not guilty, he will be publicly declared innocent. If he is guilty, he will be asked about his resume and past crimes before considering and deciding the sentence and then reopen the court for announcement, or keep it secret pending publication by higher authorities.

### Zhang Yi Should Give Instructions: Strive to Eliminate Communist Bandits

Zhang Yi, the president of National Fudan University, drove to Jiangwan Stadium yesterday morning at the invitation of Director Fang of the Municipal Party Department to give a pep talk to the conscripted soldiers passing through. He said: "After the victory of the War of Resistance, it is reasonable and logical to live in peace. The people who have suffered for eight years should be able to recuperate and live in peace and contentment. However, the Communist bandits are creating chaos, preventing the country from being unified and strong, and preventing the people from living in peace and contentment. Originally, a country can only have one government and one army. In other words, the country's political and military orders must be unified. However, the Communist bandits insist on establishing another government to compete with the National Government, organizing bandit troops in order to seize territory and claim hegemony, and colluding with foreign countries, acting as red traitors. Wherever they occupy, railways are demolished, traffic is cut off, goods cannot flow smoothly, and coal mines, ore factories, and plants are destroyed, resulting in the suspension of production. The former high-rise buildings have been burned down, leaving only rubble. The slightly wealthy have been 'liquidated' completely, and even their lives are difficult to protect. In short, the Communist bandits are shameless beasts in clothes. Unless they are eliminated, the soldiers cannot put down their guns for a single day. Only by eliminating the Communist bandits can the country be unified and strong, and you can all return home to live in peace and contentment. I hope that all comrades will do their best, fight bravely, and spare no sacrifice to eliminate the bandits and build a prosperous and happy new China." Zhang's speech lasted an hour, and his words were sincere and moving, and all who listened were inspired.

### Public Utilities Temporarily Maintain Old Prices; Bureau Director Guarantees No Increase Within Ten Days

[Our Own Report] According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, yesterday, the Public Utilities Bureau has decided to do its best to temporarily maintain the prices of public utilities. At least for the first ten days of this month, it can be guaranteed that the prices will not change. If there are no new stimuli, then it is hoped that September can be spent stably. The most important of public utilities is electricity. The current electricity price has been decided to be temporarily maintained. Large companies have decided to temporarily allow them to sacrifice, and small companies that cannot bear the losses will find other ways to compensate. If electricity generation does not increase, then trams can also maintain their original prices, and public buses will also find ways to keep their prices unchanged. Currently, the most difficult problem is gas, because the allocation price has risen sharply, which has greatly affected costs. The Public Utilities Bureau is currently studying countermeasures, or slightly revising its charging methods.

### Li Ze's Suspicions of Being a Traitor: Two Key Points of Investigation; Whether Approval Was Obtained for Participation and What Specific Contributions Were Made

[Our Own Report] The trial of the case against Li Ze, general manager of the New World Department Store, on suspicion of being a traitor, was held in the High Court yesterday afternoon. This was the twelfth hearing since the trial began. The focus of yesterday's investigation was: (1) Did he apply to the central government for approval in advance to serve as a member of the preparatory committee and director of the puppet Commercial Association? (2) What specific contributions did he make to the War of Resistance during his tenure in the puppet position? Li wore a light blue silk gown, black cloth round-toed shoes, and a folding fan in his hand. In response to the court's questioning, he stated: After receiving the notice from the puppet Ministry of Industry assigning him as a member of the preparatory committee of the puppet Commercial Association, he reported it to Huang Ruitang, the head of the Military Intelligence Bureau stationed in Shanghai, who forwarded it to the central government. Later, Huang informed him that it had been approved by the central government and showed him the telegram, which roughly stated, "Since this person has been assigned to counter-insurgency work and is protecting underground workers, he is allowed to take the puppet position and intensify counter-espionage work." However, this secret telegram could not be preserved under the circumstances at the time and was destroyed after reading. As for his contributions to the War of Resistance, such as economic assistance to underground workers, donating 77 million yuan in puppet currency to the National Salvation Army, facilitating the movement of underground workers, and reporting to the Military Intelligence Bureau that the enemy and puppets had decided to buy cotton cloth, he immediately reported this information to Chen Hao, a member of the Military Intelligence Bureau's Shanghai Direct Team. Li Ze requested Chen Hao to testify at the previous hearing, but Chen Hao did not appear in court yesterday. The court ordered a postponement of the trial, and Li Ze was still remanded in custody.

### Distribution of Electric Fans: Contradictions Before and After

[Our Own Report] A staff member of the Executive Yuan sent another letter to City Councilor Zeng yesterday, expressing suspicion about the Financial Department of the Executive Yuan's recent request for the allocation of 400 electric fans to the United Committee and reported it to the City Council. The original letter stated: "The Material Purchase and Sales Department of the Financial Department of the Executive Yuan, due to the case of selling electric fans and being exposed for corruption and fraud, the Supervisory Department once sent personnel to the Executive Yuan to investigate and instructed the Executive Yuan not to use the inventory of materials until the details were clarified. However, recently the Financial Department of the Executive Yuan again requested the allocation of 400 electric fans to the United Committee. Since the electric fans have been notified to various agencies and groups as 'out of stock and difficult to handle,' why are there electric fans allocated to the United Committee? This measure is contradictory before and after and is difficult for people to understand."

[Our Own Report] In the case of Health Bureau officials Chen Boyu and Zhu Kai for corruption and dereliction of duty, Judge Rao Zhengong of the District Court previously tried the case. Because Chen was at large, Zhu's detention was extended for two months. Defendant's lawyer Cheng Mengming believed that Judge Rao was biased and, in addition to applying for Judge Rao's recusal in court, also submitted a written application. The application was adjudicated by the collegiate bench consisting of Presiding Judge Wu Xiangzu, Judge Mei Erhe, and Judge Wu Ronglin yesterday, and it was determined that the lawyer's reasons for the application were insufficient and it was rejected. The original trial was still handled by Judge Rao. Chen Boyu, who was at large, was originally entrusted to Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei. According to a letter from the Health Bureau to the District Court, after Chen was released on bail, the bureau ordered him to find a reliable guarantor who could be held accountable. The District Court deemed its reasons to be insufficient and sent another letter to the Health Bureau to urge Chen Boyu to appear in court for interrogation in order to close the case.

### Bai Lu's Fatal Wound Confirmed to Be on the Head; Prosecutor Inspects Elevator; Believes Three Points Are Relevant

[Our Own Report] Famous actress Du Xiaomu (stage name Bai Lu) fell into the bottom of the elevator when boarding the elevator at the International Hotel, causing serious injuries and death. Yesterday morning, the body was placed in the morgue on Changde Road. At around 10 a.m., the District Procuratorate sent Prosecutor Fang Zheng, forensic doctor Gong Ziwei, and Shen Dajun to inspect the body. It was found that Du had a severe wound on her temple and injuries on both knees. The fatal injury was the wound on her temple. Jiang Junchao's brother and Du's brother were present during the autopsy. At around 2 p.m., Prosecutor Fang returned to the International Hotel to inspect the elevator. His investigation results showed that three points were related to the case: (1) The elevator speed of the hotel was higher than normal, (2) When the elevator was preparing to ascend, the outside iron door could still be pushed open by hand, (3) With so many people entering and leaving the hotel, why was there no attendant outside the elevator to take care of safety? After the autopsy was completed, Du's body was moved to the China Funeral Home, and people from the film and theater industry visited in an endless stream. Famous director Cai Chusheng went despite his illness, and others such as Shi Dongzhong, Pan Zienong, Lan Ma, and Feng Zi also went to pay their respects. The theater industry expressed great indignation at this and specially hired lawyers Jiang Yong and Zhou Hongguang to handle the case and will file a lawsuit against the person in charge of the hotel for negligent homicide. (Another report) It has been reported that a foreign female passenger fell into the bottom of the elevator and died from her injuries. It is now learned that the female passenger, Mrs. Jiang (i.e., Du Xiaomu), resided in Room 608 of the hotel. At around 10 a.m. on August 31st, she returned from outside, wearing sunglasses, and hurried into the store. Just as Elevator No. 3 was closing the outer door and rising from the bottom floor, the female passenger suddenly reached into the door with her hand, trying to push it open and rush in, causing her to lose her footing. At that time, the store attendant shouted to stop her, but it was too late. Afterwards, the police sent someone to inspect the elevator and found no flaws. Because the hotel's elevator is the most beautiful in the Far East, each elevator has eight steel ropes and is extremely safe. It was unexpected that someone would automatically push the door and squeeze in and fall down. Some say that the female passenger, wearing sunglasses, rushed in hastily and could not see clearly, which was one of the causes of the accident. It is also heard that the female passenger was returning from seeing a doctor for her illness, and her spirit may have been very unhealthy, which may have been another cause of the accident.

### Fire on Zhonghua Road; Ladder Collapses Due to Crowding; Firefighter Injured

[Our Own Report] At 9:10 p.m. last night, a fire suddenly broke out on the third floor of the Taoyuan Barber Shop opened by Sun Libao at 1264 Zhonghua Road (Anlan Road intersection) in Nanshi. The fire spread quickly, and the pump trucks of various fire departments worked hard to extinguish it. As a result, two rooms on the upper floor were burned down. At that time, a ladder truck from the Western District Fire Department, about 50 feet high, collapsed due to the collapse of the leg supports due to excessive crowding by the audience below when firefighter Jiang Chenglong held the belt and climbed up to rescue, and Jiang also fell to the ground and was injured. He was sent to the hospital for treatment. It is hoped that the police authorities will send more police officers to the scene to maintain order in the event of a fire in the future to avoid repeating the same mistake.

CNAC's trial flight on the Southeast Asia route was successful and arrived safely in Shanghai last night.

### Aibei New Coal Capital: New, Fame Not as Great as Fushun, Hopes More Than Fushun

— Shenyang August 28th Air Dispatch, Our Reporter Zhao Zhan

Vice Chairman of the Resources Committee, Mr. Sun Yueqi, along with several mining experts, arrived at Zaoxin Coal Mine on the 26th of the month for inspection. The reporter also accompanied them. They arrived at the eastern edge of Rehe. The northern autumn is refreshing, and the wind and rain are unpredictable. Fuxin's environment is just like the weather, seeking production amidst instability, having experienced several risks in the past two years.

Fuxin is a new mine. Its fame is far less than Fushun's, but its hopes are much greater than Fushun's. Fushun is almost in a state of "empty old mountains." It is said that it can still be "rejuvenated," but the huge cost involved is simply beyond reach in today's situation. Fuxin is different. It is a sapling, growing vigorously. After the Battle of Siping, the coal mines in Northeast China suffered huge losses. In fact, Fuxin has become the new coal capital of Northeast China.

In the later stages of the Japanese war of aggression, due to the extreme shortage of oil, research on refining oil from Fuxin coal was successful, and an oil refining factory was established in Mianxi, with a planned monthly output of 30,000 tons of oil. Unfortunately, the installation was not fully completed when Japan surrendered. According to a Japanese geologist retained by Zaoxin, "Jinxi has already extracted oil, but the production figures are unknown due to military secrets." Japan actively developed this treasure trove after the September 18th Incident.

The Fuxin coal seam was formed during the Jurassic period, and the coal quality is superior. The only drawback is that it cannot be used for coking. Its reserves are greater than those of Fushun. According to Japanese estimates, it is 1.24 billion tons. Another theory puts it at over 3 billion tons, but this has not been confirmed by drilling. Because the coal seam is continuously formed, there are three coalfields: Fuxin, Zhangwu, and Badaohao. Fuxin is the largest. Currently, only Fuxin and a part of the northern area of Badaohao are being mined. The Zhangwu coalfield has not yet been developed.

Fuxin has a total of six mines, namely Xinqiu, Gaode, Taiping, Sunjiawan, Wulong, and Ping'an. Within twelve hours, we visited the Xinqiu, Taiping, and Sunjiawan mines, as well as the coal preparation plant and the main machinery plant. Sunjiawan's

open-pit mining produces 1,500 tons per day. Xinqiu's open-pit mining is currently stripping the soil. The six mines have a total of 38 inclined shafts. We spent two hours visiting one inclined shaft of the Taiping Branch. Guided by two young engineers, we went 400 meters underground to explore the underground storage and the laborers living in the stratum. Each of us changed into new mining clothes, gray cloth clothes and trousers, rubber-soled shoes, carrying a stick in our hands, and wearing a "steel helmet" woven from willow branches on our heads, with a carbide lamp attached to it. The team of a dozen people looked like a fire dragon, walking down step by step. The engineer guiding me and I walked at the front. After entering 100 meters below the surface, there were no longer any pit wood supports, only a few supports at the most dangerous places. I was uneasy in my heart and asked, "Isn't this dangerous?" The engineer answered calmly, "It is dangerous, but there is a lack of pit wood, and there is no way around it. We are very careful. Since taking over, there hasn't been a single unfortunate incident." His words reassured me. After entering the mine, I believed that the engineer's words were power. Probably the first person to enter the mine would be worried.

We arrived at

a corner 400 meters below the surface, and there were still 200 meters below. We saw workers using electric drills and explosives to attack the mine. I admired them as the greatest of mankind. This uses a small contracting system, where workers pay for their labor and receive one share of the reward. But contracting is not a reasonable system, and workers may be threatened by illness. The mine answered this question by saying, "If a worker is sick for a short period of time, wages are paid according to the usual standard of income. If they are sick for more than a month, two-thirds of the wages are paid." It is said that workers can receive death benefits, a public fund employee mutual assistance life insurance, and four types of guarantees from the Resource Committee's insurance office. If a worker unfortunately dies, the living expenses of his family for five years are not a problem. Under the current social environment and work management, only this.

The small contracting system is the best system for maintaining work efficiency. If we do not advocate a one-point profit and one-point money system, it is impossible to maintain work efficiency. The workers' knowledge level is very low. Eighty percent of the workers are illiterate. They can earn an average of about 1,200 yuan per day. Sorghum rice sells for 300 yuan per catty, and life is very difficult. Most of them are from Shandong and Hebei, leaving their suffering hometowns for ten or twenty years and coming to the "New World."

Security must be ensured before production can be discussed. The staff and workers of the Bixin Coal Mine all feel this way. They are threatened by the communists. There are small groups of communists operating twenty miles north of Fuxin. Therefore, a large number of important equipment is stored in Hanyang Jin Yizhou, and they dare not transport it until security is no longer a problem. The families of the staff live in Tianjin. Mr. Sun Yueqi said, "This is an expensive method. On the one hand, we have to eat, and on the other hand, we have to guard against thieves." Secondly, tight funds and lack of electricity, timber, and food are all important factors that shrink production.

The Fuxin coal mine has been reorganized for more than a year since its receipt in 1946 and has restored one-third of its original production.

### Huainan Salt Administration Officially Reorganized and Established Yesterday: Ministry of Finance Appoints Gu Jianzhong as Director

[Report from our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 1st] The Huainan Branch of the Yangzhou Lianghuai Salt Affairs Administration was ordered to be changed to the Huainan Salt Affairs Administration.

Mr. Gu passed through Zhenjiang today to take office in Yangzhou.

### Using Tree Branches as Weapons: Dacheng Hall Resembles a Fortress: Zheng Students' Brawl Becomes Serious

[Report from our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 29th] On Teachers' Day here, a dispute arose between students from the county normal school and students from Anyang who had fled to Zhengzhou over the use of the Dacheng Hall. Negotiations over the past two days have been ineffective, and conflicts have resumed. One Anyang student was beaten, and the situation is trending towards becoming complicated. When the Anyang students who had fled to Zhengzhou returned to stay overnight at the Dacheng Hall on the 28th evening, they unexpectedly found that the gate to the Dacheng Hall had been locked. This led to another quarrel with the students from the county normal school. The two sides fought for a while, and Wang Derong, an Anyang student staying at the Zheng County Vocational School, also participated in the battle and was injured in the leg. The gate to the Dacheng Hall was naturally opened, and the Anyang students still stayed inside that night. However, that night, Wang Shaozeng, an Anyang student who came out to urinate, was also injured in the leg, but the injuries were not serious. Another Anyang student who came out to urinate, Wang Shaoxian, was lucky to have lost his shoes and was not beaten. They harbored resentment, and on the 29th, some Anyang students went to burn branches from trees in the school as firewood, which led to another conflict. The incident started at 4:00 PM. The students from the county normal school took the Boy Scout sticks as weapons and occupied the front yard. The Anyang students took tree branches and firewood as weapons and used the Dacheng Hall as their base. The students from the county normal school could not enter, and the Anyang students could not come out. More than 200 people on each side faced each other sternly. Police Chief Song Zengyun, County Head Gao Anlun, Anyang Councilor Chairman Tian Gengli, as well as several school principals and teachers, originally went to mediate, but for some reason, the mediators did not get along. One said, "Let's say it's our Zhengzhou's fault for offending the guests," and the other said, "Let's say it's our fault for being driven to Zhengzhou by the communists." Later, the words of both sides became increasingly unpleasant, and the mediators also took the sides of the parties involved. Fortunately, the situation did not escalate into a fight because the county head ordered the teachers and students of the county normal school to withdraw completely. By this time, it was already after 7:00 PM. However, both sides are now holding meetings, and it seems that they are both taking further actions. It is also heard that the teacher surnamed Liang, who led the Anyang students to use force last time, has been arrested. This happened before the incident on the 29th.

### Hankou Reporter Assaulted: Perpetrator Arrested

### Suzhou Journalists' Association: Application for Registration of New Members: 52 People Rejected

[Report from our newspaper, Suzhou, 2nd] The Suzhou Journalists' Association previously publicly solicited members, with an admission fee of 30,000 yuan per person. A total of 68 applications for new member registration were received, but the results of the review showed that only 7 people qualified, 9 people needed to submit supplementary documents for re-examination, and the remaining 52 people were all rejected on the grounds that they did not meet the provisions of Article 3 of the Journalists Law. It is learned that the 52 rejected people believe that Article 3 of the Journalists Law stipulates the qualifications for obtaining a certificate. Joining the association has other regulations in the constitution, which stipulate that all current journalists should join as members. Therefore, this review seems to be a distortion of the law, the result of excluding dissidents, and difficult to convince. Now, the entire group has jointly telegraphed the National Government's various ministries, provincial government's various departments, party headquarters at all levels, and colleagues across the country to appeal for justice, and has submitted a request to the Suzhou County Government for legal relief.

### Longhai Railway's No. 8 Steel Bridge Destroyed by Bandits

[Report from our newspaper, Kaifeng, 30th] The largest and most dangerous project on the Longhai Railway is the No. 8 Bridge. The bridge is located between Guanyintang Station and Xiashi Station, is 42 meters high and 110 meters long. Because the bridge is being built over a ravine, the depth of the ravine is almost invisible when looking down. A wooden trestle bridge was built to maintain traffic. The difficulty of the project is indescribable. The construction of a concrete steel beam bridge began in May of this year. The bridge project was 90% complete when, unexpectedly, at this critical moment, the communists crossed the Yellow River and invaded, and stations such as Mianchi, Xin'an, and Guanyintang fell into the hands of the bandits one after another. The bridge construction site was the first to bear the brunt. As a last resort, all employees were ordered to evacuate on the morning of the 27th, and the steel bridge and trestle bridge were destroyed by bandits at the same time on the 28th. The efforts of all the employees over the past month have now been reduced to nothing.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 2nd] The Chinese government, in collaboration with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), is convening the Far East Regional Basic Education Research Conference, scheduled to open at 10:00 a.m. on the 3rd at the Academia Sinica on Beijige, Nanjing. Among the twelve participating units, all representatives are expected to attend on time, except for those from Pakistan and the Philippines who have not yet arrived in Nanjing. Dr. Guo Youshou, Director of the Education Department of UNESCO, Dr. Rawson (Head of the Department of Social Education at the University of London), and Professor Eguilan, a representative of the Mexican Ministry of Education, arrived in Nanjing a few days ago. They will join Dr. Hubbard, a social education expert from Ping and Nanjing, to represent UNESCO at the conference. At a press conference held at the Ministry of Education at 5:30 p.m. on the 2nd, Guo and others explained the upcoming conference, stating that basic education is UNESCO's most important work. More than half of the world's population still cannot read, and educational opportunities are excessively unequal, which is detrimental to world peace. Therefore, the first UNESCO General Conference last winter and the UNESCO Standing Committee this spring successively decided that basic education is one of the three major priority programs to be particularly emphasized this year. Plans were drawn up to hold regional basic education research conferences in China and Mexico, and to implement "demonstration designs" in China, Haiti, British East Africa, and the Amazon River Basin. During the Chinese War of Resistance, special attention was given to basic education, and great progress has been made in recent years. Therefore, holding a regional research conference in our country's capital can allow the participating representatives to understand and value the new concepts and experiments contributed by China in basic education methods and approaches.

Purpose of the Basic Education Conference

The purpose of the Basic Education Conference is to emphasize both academic and technical aspects, collect data, exchange opinions, engage with facts, and formulate comprehensive and feasible methods for promoting basic education and demonstration designs, so as to submit recommendations to the second UNESCO General Conference to be held in Mexico City in November this year. The regional conference to be held in Mexico will coincide with the second UNESCO General Conference. Professor Eguilan is here to collect reference materials. Guo also mentioned that Dr. Huxley, Director-General of UNESCO, has always been extremely concerned about China's cultural and educational affairs. This time, he entrusted him to bring letters to President Chiang, President Zhang, Minister Zhu, Foreign Minister Wang, and figures in China's educational, scientific, and cultural circles, expressing admiration for China's cultural and educational contributions and extending condolences to Chinese cultural and educational workers. He also plans to visit China in 1950. After attending this conference, Guo and others will leave here for France before the 20th, stopping briefly in India and Egypt along the way to connect with cultural and educational figures in those places. They are expected to return to Paris in early October and then go to Mexico City at the end of the month to attend the second UNESCO General Conference.

### Remarks by the Mexican Representative

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 2nd] Professor Eguilan, the representative of the Mexican Ministry of Education who came to Nanjing to participate in the UNESCO Far East Regional Basic Education Conference, told reporters that he was very excited to come to China and was greatly interested in the local customs and culture of this country with over 4,000 years of history. He stated that China and Mexico have many similarities in social history and revolutionary experiences, and they share the same aspirations and expectations for the future of the world. He hopes to cooperate in various ways to promote democracy in the world.

### Adjustment of the Exchange Rate for US Dollars and Gold - Calculated According to the Foreign Exchange Listing - 3% Handling Fee for US Dollar Receipts - US$40 per tael of Gold

Regarding the exchange rate for US dollar cash, the previous method has been changed to a foreign exchange method, and the previously set price should be adjusted urgently. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has now stipulated the following methods, notifying the Central Bank to follow:

(1) US dollar cash may be exchanged at the US dollar foreign exchange market price (the Central Bank's foreign exchange stabilization fund exchange rate), and a 3% handling fee may be charged (the handling fee should be calculated on a per-transaction basis, rounded off to the nearest hundred yuan in national currency).

(2) In addition to the Central Bank's own exchange, it has entrusted the China, Jiaotong, Citibank, and Chase banks to handle the exchange matters on its behalf.

As for the exchange rate for gold, the Ministry of Finance has also been authorized by telegram to exchange pure gold at US$41 per tael according to the original rate set by the Central Bank. The conversion rate shall be calculated by converting it into national currency according to the US dollar exchange rate. For example, according to the US dollar exchange rate of 38,500 on September 2, each tael is converted into 1,540,000 yuan in national currency ((38,500 x 40 = 1,540,000).

The above two methods will be implemented from September 3rd. Legitimate merchants holding US dollars and gold can go to exchange them according to the above regulations. As for the measures to crack down on gold speculation and prohibit the circulation of foreign currency banknotes, they should be strictly implemented in accordance with the resolutions of the State Council. Those who violate the law and engage in the purchase and sale of gold and US dollars will be severely punished by the government according to law.

1.  The foreign exchange obtained from the export of consignment goods should be settled in accordance with the current market price announced by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee if it is paid or sold within the time limit stipulated in the Central Bank's Circular No. 85.

2.  The foreign exchange obtained from the export of consignment goods should be settled at the market price on the last day of the period for each item of goods if it is paid or sold outside the prescribed time limit. If the market price has not been announced on that day, the foreign exchange for the goods should be settled at the official price of the Central Bank.

Regarding newly exported consignment goods, that is, those shipped on and after August 16, 1947, they should be handled in accordance with the following articles:

1.  The foreign exchange obtained from the export of consignment goods must be settled by the designated bank within three days at the latest after receiving the payment notice by letter or telegram from a foreign branch or agent, in accordance with the above-mentioned market price if it is paid or sold within the prescribed time limit.

2.  The foreign exchange obtained from the export of consignment goods (if it is not paid or sold within the time limit stipulated in Circular No. 85) should be settled at the market price on the last day of the prescribed time limit for the consignment goods.

[Our Report] The 22nd joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the National Cotton Mill Association was held at 4:00 PM on the 1st in the meeting room of the China Textile Construction Corporation. Chairman Dong Yinzhang presided over the meeting. The important resolutions are as follows:

(1) The association previously requested to send two representatives to participate in the National Economic Commission. The commission replied that the organization had been established and could not be widely extended. In the future, if there are small group meetings to discuss the textile industry, representatives will be invited to participate. As the commission is currently reviewing the yarn and cloth regulation plan, the association decided to request that representatives be sent to participate.

(2) The association's second member congress is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of this month. The original plan was for each district to send one member representative for every 1,000 spindles, which would result in too many people. It has now been decided to change the plan to use district associations as the unit, with one representative for every 10,000 spindles up to 100,000 spindles, and one representative for every 30,000 spindles above 100,000 spindles. Thread spindles will be calculated in the same way as yarn spindles, with each automatic loom counted as 20 spindles and each ordinary loom counted as 15 spindles. According to this calculation, the total number of representatives sent by district associations will be around 180. The above plan will be implemented after consulting with the district associations.

(3) The second member congress plans to put forward a textile industry revitalization plan, which will be implemented step by step after being approved by the congress. The plan will also expand publicity to promote the textile industry's important position in China's industry, it is said.

### Bulls and Bears Equally Matched, Not Much Movement in Chinese Stocks

However, the bears still exerted pressure, and high prices were difficult to sustain. Near the close, the bulls and bears fought fiercely.

In the early morning, due to the huge volume of interbank exchange transactions, the market inevitably felt tired. After the opening of Di Yongsha, the market was slightly stabilized with the support of retail bulls.

Numbers 2335 and others slightly supplied stock, causing a retreat to 245 yuan.

After 10:30 AM, credit eased, and the overnight interest rate opened low at 1 jiao and 1 jiao 9.5 fen, boosting confidence. Numbers 223, etc., added to their positions. Number 22 even bought Di Yongsha. Rumors also circulated that two major officials were resigning, causing a gradual rebound to 254 yuan. Numbers 218, etc., sold at high prices, and Number 67 supplied Di Yongsha, causing a retreat to 246 yuan. Near the close, the bulls made a full effort to push up the market. Number 223, etc., vigorously purchased stock, and Number 152 even fiercely purchased Di Yongsha, causing the market to rebound to 1147 yuan and close at 251 yuan.

### Autumn Cocoon Loan Measures, Manufacturers Unwilling to Accept

[Our Report] The silk reeling associations of the three districts convened an emergency meeting and telegraphed a request to implement the joint cocoon and silk production and sales plan. After the Four Banks Joint Office agreed on this year's autumn cocoon purchase loan measures, the silk reeling associations of the three districts felt that the measures were inconsistent with the general outline of the government's announced cocoon and silk production and sales plan for this year and were difficult to accept. Moreover, the time for the arrival of autumn cocoons is approaching, leaving little time for back-and-forth consultations. Therefore, it was resolved to telegraph the Four Banks Joint Office to continue to handle the matter in accordance with the original cocoon and silk production and sales outline to avoid difficulties for both factories and farmers, it is said.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions opened steadily, but soon the market became overwhelmed with speculation due to the large-scale sale of textiles by the Fangjian Company the previous day. The actual sales were sluggish, and the money market remained tight, leading to market nervousness. The market subsequently declined. In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by another 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day, with a low of 18.2 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was dull and weak. Business in the local market and shops remained sluggish, and the appetite of customers from other regions was also flagging. As a result, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was down by 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, at 480,000 yuan.

Spot Cotton Stable

Yesterday's spot cotton market conditions were stable. Yarn factories' demand turned strong, and yarn factories from other regions also increased their purchases. Transactions turned brisk. Prices were neither high nor low, and the footing showed a firm trend. Total daily transactions were around 1,100 bales.

### Rayon Firm and Stable

Yesterday's rayon market conditions were firm and stable. As a result, prices were up by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The last bid price for 120-count Jin Sanma and Xuzi Youguang in the afternoon was 26.4 million yuan. The factory was quiet, and there were few inquiries for all grades of Wudan head. Bid prices softened accordingly, down by an average of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Qianjing was worried about sluggish sales, and bid prices for all goods were lowered. The silk market was tight yesterday due to the tight credit situation of those in the industry. Various parties were selling off their holdings, so the opening price for true silk quilts was down slightly, and the price of Huaqiang goods was expected to decline. The market price of Dacheng goods was similar. The bid price for Gezi Jianzhou was down by 500 yuan, but there were still few transactions. The firmness or weakness of other goods varied.

### Rice Continues Downstream

Yesterday, over 11,300 shih of rice arrived in the north and south markets. Digestion was sluggish, and the market continued to decline. Japonica rice stepped down by 10,000 yuan.

Flour was allocated and sold as usual, and the price was unchanged. Miscellaneous flour was average, and unified flour was weak by 1,000 yuan. The price of bran in large packages was stable, while the price of bran in small packages soared by over 2,000 yuan due to brisk sales in Zhejiang. Sales of soybean cakes were average, and the price did not increase. The market for yellow soybeans opened weak, but oil factories strengthened their demand at noon, turning the market from weak to stable. As a result, there was little change.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation, Disputes in Old-Style Marriages

[Xu Neng Asks] My cousin, Mr. Jia, is 22 years old. Two years ago, his parents arranged a marriage for him with Ms. Yi. Although he expressed dissatisfaction at the time, he did not strongly object due to economic constraints and circumstances. Last year, Mr. Jia met Ms. Bing while studying in Shanghai. They fell in love at first sight and vowed to be together forever. They are now living together. Ms. Bing has repeatedly urged Mr. Jia to marry her, but he is hesitant because his marriage contract with Ms. Yi has not been dissolved. Mr. Jia has raised the issue of denying the marriage contract with his family, but has not been able to fulfill his wishes due to the constraints of old ethics. Now, in order to resolve the matter urgently, he has several questions to ask your lawyer for guidance so he can follow the law. (1) Is a marriage contract arranged by parents without the consent of the person himself valid? (2) From a legal point of view, can Mr. Jia unilaterally publish a denial of the marriage contract in the newspaper? (3) If Mr. Jia proposes to terminate the contract, can Ms. Yi demand compensation for losses from Mr. Jia? (4) Mr. Jia is already living with Ms. Bing. If Ms. Yi finds out, can she sue Mr. Jia or Ms. Bing for bigamy or interfering with marriage?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] (1) According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, "A marriage contract shall be entered into by the man and woman themselves." Since this marriage contract was not obtained with the consent of the person concerned, it is invalid. (2) Publishing a denial in the newspaper is certainly permissible, but since the marriage contract is invalid, publishing it or not is not necessary. (3) Since the marriage contract is invalid, Ms. Yi has no right to make any demands. (4) Since Mr. Jia and Ms. Yi are not married, Mr. Jia and Ms. Bing's marriage does not constitute bigamy.

### Readers' Letters

To Zhao Zisheng of Wuxi: The symptoms you described are quite similar to "Lou Ma Si." You should seek medical treatment. When sleeping at night, avoid getting cold to prevent the condition from worsening. The prescription for medication must be determined after a doctor's diagnosis. You are over fifty years old, so pay attention to whether your blood pressure is too high.

To Zhou Dawei of Shanghai: I have received your letter. Your illness is likely "Gangrene." You should seek treatment from a pulmonologist as soon as possible and do not delay.

To Huang Kezhi of Shanghai: Your son's illness was originally only early-stage lung disease. If he had received appropriate treatment in time, he should have recovered long ago. However, one mistake led to another, not only deepening his lung disease but also causing other illnesses. Over the years, he has been indiscriminately treated with Chinese and Western medicine, which was a mistake. If there is no lung or internal medicine doctor with both scholarship and wealth in the countryside or nearby cities, it is always more hopeful to seek treatment in Shanghai, because Shanghai is not short of famous doctors, and the equipment of major hospitals is quite complete. It is inevitable to scratch an itch through boots when communicating about illness by letter, and it is also a slow solution to an urgent problem. The so-called cure after taking medicine requires first determining the location of the disease before prescribing targeted treatment.

To Pei Jun of Shanghai: I have received your letter. Please discuss it directly with a specialist doctor.

To Li Ping of Shanghai: I have received your letter. Please inquire directly with the Shanghai Cixi Road No. 25 Doctors Association, which will transfer your letter to the New Medicine and New Drug Society.

To Chen Liming of Shanghai: You should first normalize your bowel movements. As for how to treat it, please consult a doctor and decide.

Spring and Autumn

### Sent from Qingdao

— Zhao Qingge

××:

I dare say, you would never have imagined that I would suddenly send you a letter from Qingdao.

Really, my decision was too "sudden." Three days before leaving, even I couldn't "imagine" it. It was like this: My father stayed in Shanghai for two weeks, affording me a little bit of familial joy, and then he left again. This stirred up a heart full of sorrow for parting! Just at this moment of utter boredom, a sudden opportunity lured me to have a sudden idea – to travel? Yes! Traveling can dispel troubled moods and thoughts – therefore, I suddenly flew away!

Now, as I write this letter, I have suddenly decided that tomorrow I will fly to another place. I have developed a strong interest in "suddenness." I am very pleased with this unplanned, unconstrained, free, and unrestrained action! I have pondered: If I could spend my whole life flying east, flying west, flying south, flying north, like a bird without a nest, how wonderful!

I have gained a lot in Qingdao (of course, all spiritual gains). Up until yesterday, I finished the ends of two long novels. I worked so diligently and enthusiastically. My literary inspiration seemed to have been filtered by the seawater, flowing so smoothly and unhindered! Unlike in Shanghai, where I worked so tiredly, so painfully, with so much resentment and hatred! At the same time, my body and mood are much better. All day long, I breathe fresh air that is ten thousand times better than artificial vitamin pills; I bask in gentle but not strong sunlight; I roam in the realm of nature; and I enjoy boundless tranquility and boundless peace. Do you think there is any reason why I should not be healthy and happy?

Since Qingdao is so good, I can't help but write a few words to praise her before I leave, to introduce you to this northern mountain city surrounded by water on three sides and bordering land on one side (i.e., the Jiaoji Railway, which is currently under contention).

I don't remember in whose book Qingdao was praised as the Switzerland of China. I have never been to Switzerland, so I dare not blindly agree. But to say that Qingdao is one of the most beautiful and artistic places in China is not an exaggeration.

Let's start with the scenery of Qingdao – the sea window, draped with a turquoise blue gauze curtain, opens wide on three sides between heaven and earth, embracing a green mountain city, with countless red-roofed foreign houses dotting a green expanse, looking from afar like blooming peach blossoms or plum blossoms! Can you say that this is not the most elegant, most poetic, and most beautiful painting?

Then there is the climate of Qingdao – in the hot and humid summer, if your heart is very calm and your actions are not too hasty, then you can spend the whole day without sweating, and you still need to cover yourself with a towel blanket at night. Whether it is day or night, a cool sea breeze is constantly blowing. So I think this is the best place to escape the summer heat, unlike Guling, Emei, where after reaching the summit, you have to wear a lined robe and even use a brazier (Emei is like that). According to a person who has lived in Qingdao for a long time, a wool coat is enough to keep warm in winter. Then isn't it always spring and autumn here throughout the year?

Now, let me briefly talk about the social situation of Qingdao based on a little superficial impression from my pilgrimage – it is an international city, so it has a mixed Sino-Western atmosphere. For example, the architecture is absolutely Europeanized and modern. You can't find a single old Chinese bungalow; even the toilets are Western-style. In this way, it appears very neat and beautiful. Almost every family has a small courtyard, where you can plant flowers and grass. Unlike Shanghai, where each lane house has at most a small patch of open space the size of a palm. Garden houses are of course also available, but only a few people live in them. The commerce here seems very sluggish, and there are both Chinese and Western businesses. On half a street similar to Avenue Joffre in Shanghai, there are many foreign-owned shops, but they sell fewer foreign goods and more antiques from Beiping. There are also many antique shops run by Chinese. There are few bookstores. There is a hospital on almost every street, which I don't quite understand. How can the medical industry be so developed in a place that is not easy to get sick? There are many Western restaurants and cafes, but very few Chinese restaurants. There are many tea shops, but no teahouses. A high-class large cafe on the beach has a dance floor and a foreign band. However, the dancers are not active. There are also several cafes with dance floors in the city, which are facilities for American sailors, with singers and dancers. The roads are like those in Chongqing, sometimes high and sometimes low, but they are very smooth and clean. Naturally, there are some corners where you can't help but see some garbage and dung. But on the whole, it is clean. Both large and small roads are planted with sycamore trees and poplars, which have already formed shade. Transportation is convenient, with buses, small jeep cars (picking up passengers along the way), and machine rickshaws. Except on the beach where you can meet some modern Chinese and Western men and women, on the sidewalks in the city, you only see simple and honest northern locals coming and going. Most of the women still wear half-length tops and trousers that cover their feet. Some of them have their hair tied in buns, which is not very harmonious with the situation on the beach. However, in my opinion, maintaining these many simple northern flavors is not too unsightly. Regarding the customs here, I encountered a local funeral once. In the front was a monotonous and emotionless band playing funeral music, all dressed in red and green. Then came two sedan chairs, open and empty. Seeing this, I thought it was a wedding! But then came the filial sons wearing hemp and mourning clothes, and finally a coffin covered with a brocade shroud. This was indeed the first time I had seen this, so I was very curious. Regarding the human feelings here, they are much thicker than in the South. If you go to a shop run by locals to buy something, they will treat you as a guest. They will greet you when you come and see you off when you leave. Even if you have bothered them for a long time and haven't bought anything, they will never utter a word and will still be very polite. There is not much exaggeration in bargaining. If you go to a restaurant and spend thirty to fifty thousand yuan, you only give a small tip of about one thousand yuan, and they all shout "Thank you." (This trend is almost the same in various parts of the North.) Now it is time to mention the education and culture here. I learned from a friend that it is quite depressed. One university is the National Shandong University, which was destroyed during the war. After the war, President Zhao Taiyou came back to revive it. The results are not bad, with three colleges: medicine, science, and literature. A few famous professors are invited, such as Ding Xilin, Lu Kanru, and Feng Yuanjun. However, the school buildings and equipment are not very well-equipped, because it is equivalent to a new creation. There are many difficulties, and it will take some time to perfect it. The other primary and secondary schools are also not very prosperous. The news industry may be more developed. There are many newspapers and news agencies. There are also several publications, mostly literary. The content is rather poor. The circulation is not very good, and it is greatly affected by Shanghai newspapers and yellow publications. In terms of entertainment, there are occasional amateur performances of dramas. Currently, a Shanghai theater troupe is here to make a quick profit. I don't know how the results are. Peking opera performances in the Shanghai style are extremely popular. Three out of four movie theaters show Chinese films. The several parks are as ordinary as parks everywhere. On the whole, Qingdao is in progress. The situation in the market is also stable. It doesn't seem as terrifying as the rumors outside for a while. You can't smell any gunpowder smoke, only occasionally a few sounds of toy guns from American children at night.

Above, I have sketched Qingdao so hastily. I don't know if it will give you a lovable concept? I don't care! Anyway, I love Qingdao, everything about Qingdao, especially the scenery, climate, and human feelings! How much I hate Shanghai! That hustle and bustle, that chaos, that heat, that cunning, that coldness!

These days, I have hardly seen any friends (and there are very few friends). Besides writing, I go out for walks alone. Whether it is the beach, the mountains, the streets, or the alleys, I have been to them all. Whether it is a Western restaurant, a cafe, a dance hall, or a dumpling shop, I have sat in them all. I like to wander around aimlessly, especially in an unfamiliar place. People don't know me; I don't know people; I don't have to nod and greet people on the street; you can do whatever you want, no one cares about you, and no one pays attention to you. How free!

Others may feel that my life here is too lonely, and I can't say twenty words a day (because there is no one to talk to), and I would get sick from boredom! But I don't think so. On the contrary, the more people there are, the more lonely I feel. I love this loneliness, this loneliness immersed in the realm of nature – only in this loneliness can I touch my true self; only then can I feel boundless peace; only then can my spirit be comfortably liberated; only then can my emotions be leisurely sublimated; only then can my soul rest; only then can my heart be at peace!

I often want to sit in a seaside cafe, slowly drinking a glass of brandy, while looking up at the vast and boundless blue sea and thinking about the long and boundless past and future! (Of course, all are more pleasant things. I cast aside everything that would disturb me). I sit from dusk to sunset, from sunset to sunrise. I forget that I still live in a group society. I am dizzy and actually think that I live on a deserted island with only myself! If that's really the case, how good!

Okay! I will end here. I will write to you again when I get to a new place tomorrow. Blessings! (August 26)

By Alfred, Lord Tennyson:

Crossing the Bar - Translated by Zhen Le Shi

Sunset and evening star,

And one clear call for me!

And may there be no moaning of the bar,

When I put out to sea,

But such a tide as moving seems asleep,

Too full for sound and foam,

When that which drew from out the boundless deep

Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,

And after that the dark!

And may there be no sadness of farewell,

When I embark;

For though from out our bourne of Time and Place

The flood may bear me far,

I hope to see my Pilot face to face

When I have crossed the bar.

[Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a great poet of the Victorian era in England. For a detailed introduction, see "Chunqiu" in this newspaper on August 6, which will not be repeated. The poem above was written by Tennyson not long before his death. The "that which drew from out the boundless deep" mentioned in the second stanza refers to the poet himself, and "crossed the bar" means death. The poet compares the eternity of life and death to the "ocean" and "flood," and the "Pilot" in the last stanza refers to God. - Translator]

### Floating and Sinking - Sent to A Ye

— Sang Mu

Saying that I wanted to lengthen my life, I came out of the small town and breathed in this corner of the ten-mile foreign concession. Strolling alone under the French parasol trees, I sometimes taste the meaning of life, but after filling my empty stomach, there is another kind of discomfort. There are many people coming and going on the road, but I still feel like I am in the Gobi Desert. Where are the green grass and springs?

"In order to chase the crumbs of bread, friendship is isolated."

So people will become haggard. Who says otherwise? In the cool breeze of dusk, I pluck the strings of my restless heart and play a lonely elegy to a distant friend, then listen carefully to the warm echo.

It came, trekking through thousands of mountains and rivers. The words on the cover are really much older. I like the scorched yellow earth paper, and I read it for another week. It was written by you, and it's like me again.

Even if you drink all the poisoned wine,

The present poverty is hard to bury.

Saying that the dagger can stop life,

It is also difficult to dye the sorrow of death.

If yesterday was a nightmare,

How can today continue to decorate warmth?

The mirage of many years ago,

Unable to touch the edge of memory.

But these short sentences composed of single words are the warmth of sympathy. No, my heart is even more desolate.

Time is in a long string of sadness, and time is really old. The life in the small town still remains in my mind. Boating on the lake, singing loudly with a glass of wine, telling each other's hearts knee to knee, listening to the boatman weaving an old story, the oldness of many years ago, is resurrected in my heart. I support the clouds in my heart with a toast, and laughter begins on the eve of farewell. After a large handful of torn days, you will no longer envy and praise, you said "If yesterday was a nightmare," riding the long wind, breaking through thousands of miles of waves, will I be proud that I once had a sweet dream?

Quietly, I have to breathe deeply, but I will never again and I am unwilling to weave a beautiful dream. It is enough happiness to be able to keep my life going. Please don't look at my face, it is thicker and I say so: "Living in this difficult century is really our good fortune, let's learn from real life!"

Although I clearly know that you will always say "complaining is the breath of the weak," I have put a sentence on the last page of the handbook of encouragement from classmates when I left school, I am willing to dedicate it to myself, in order to let life live and die by itself, without destroying it with my own hands, I write carefully: "Having a career is always happiness!"

Young little guy! Under the exploitation of the usury of love, we have exhausted all our youth to repay it. It is not anemia but it must be anemia, and it can't stand excessive and heavy loads. I want to review the freshness in spring, friend, let me gently say in your ear: "Please walk from real life".

What? In the crowing dawn, I still have to get up early to fill my belly.

### One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch

— Ye Jingfeng

Yaoqun and Little Tiger did not change their clothes this time when entering the pass, because they wanted to use that "pass." The passenger car they were riding in took advantage of the southward-bound Japanese army transport, which was four or five hours faster. As soon as they arrived at Tianjin Old Station, the passenger car was blocked and could not transfer to Beiping. So Qun discussed with Little Tiger, planning to delay in Tianjin for half a day, to inquire about traffic news on the one hand, and to take a look at what Tianjin had become on the other hand; anyway, there was plenty of time.

Qun originally wanted to find a hotel near Laolongtou Old Station, but then she suddenly thought of something and told Little Tiger, "Let's go to the 'French Concession'."

"Should we hire a car or walk, Aunt Ji?" Having just gone through endless troubles, walking out of the station, Little Tiger asked.

"You want to 'see' things, right?..." People from the Northeast often ask questions, Yaoqun could not be an exception: "And I also want to buy some small things; can't we just walk over there?"

"Okay, Aunt Ji..." Little Tiger agreed, while looking east and west, as if she were a country bumpkin who had come to the city for the first time, and everything on the street was worth a look.

It was a little after 9:00 AM. The southbound train had just arrived, and the northbound train was about to arrive. These two streets near Laolongtou were crowded with people, like ants, and did not become deserted due to the occupation. On the contrary, it seemed even more lively.

"Aunt Ji!" Little Tiger wanted to speak again.

"What?" Yaoqun was paying attention to the scene on French and Italian streets; she was paying attention to the people.

"Why don't we hire a car?" Little Tiger raised two small bundles of clothes.

"Are you tired?" Yaoqun looked at the small bundles in Little Tiger's hand; "Give me one," she said, reaching out to take it; indicating that she didn't want to make her uncomfortable.

"No... it's just a little bit of stuff, only two or three catties, why would I be tired?" Little Tiger walked forward, her eyes still constantly looking around.

"Aunt Ji!" After walking two steps, Little Tiger called out to Yaoqun again.

"Hey... this child!" Yaoqun had something on her mind; on the one hand, she had to pay attention to things that she thought should be noticed. Usually, Little Tiger and Yaoqun always took the same action, taking Luo Yaohua's goal as the goal, but at this time, she suddenly became so mixed up, repeatedly interrupting Yaoqun's attention, Yaoqun couldn't help but feel a little strange. "What's wrong, Tiger?"

"Nothing..." Little Tiger showed a face that was both smiling and not smiling, wanting to speak but not speaking: "I'm saying, it's quite a long way from here to the 'French Concession'..."

"Quite a long way?" Yaoqun became even more strange; "It's just a short walk, one or two li to cross the bridge, and a few more steps after crossing the bridge..." Saying this, she glanced at where Little Tiger's gaze was sweeping, and then looked at Little Tiger's expression. She couldn't help but laugh: "You blind... this child!"

### The Glorious Day

— Yi Feng

—Written in Commemoration of Victory Day

Today two years ago – September 3, 1945, was a glorious and precious day. On the morning of this day, a solemn and good show was staged on the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay: Japanese imperialism fell. Our (General Xu Yongchang, accompanied by Allied five-star Marshal MacArthur and other generals, spent eighteen minutes settling the crimes of Japanese militarists' decades of aggression. The Allied forces won, and we turned over!

This is such a solemn directing technique: The largest American battleship, the Missouri, was surrounded by aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers, quietly anchored in Tokyo Bay. The clock pointed to half past eight, and General Nimitz, who had white hair, arrived at the scene. He and MacArthur are both five-star marshals. Fifteen minutes later, MacArthur appeared, and military music was played loudly, and all officers saluted. Our delegation of six people, including General Xu Yongchang, and the delegation of the surrendering country also appeared before 8:40 AM. At that time, there were nearly four hundred news reporters watching the surrender, and they were busy using cameras and pens to record this scene from beginning to end for future generations to commemorate.

As the clock moved closer to nine o'clock, the eleven members of the Japanese delegation, with grim faces, led by Shigemitsu Aoi (representing the Emperor and the government) and Umezu Mijiro, were led onto the deck by American officers. The band on the ship also played for them, expressing welcome, because this is international etiquette. The arrangement on the deck included a long table covered with green cloth, two copies of the surrender document, an ink bottle, and a broadcasting machine. It was simple, tidy, and full of a solemn atmosphere. The Japanese representatives stood in three rows. The first row was Shigemitsu and Umezu, the second row was five people, and the third row was four people. They stood there with gloomy faces for six minutes, so that their true faces could be seen by the right people. Especially Shigemitsu Aoi, probably because he only had one leg, seemed to have a hard time standing, and sweat dripped down his face.

At exactly nine o'clock, the surrender ceremony began. After MacArthur read a very short broadcast speech in front of the broadcasting machine, he ordered the Japanese representatives to sign. The first one was Shigemitsu. Because he only had one leg, he was specially given a seat. Who knew that the fountain pen he took out was dry. The pen was big, and the mouth of the ink bottle was small, so it was impossible to absorb water, which was very embarrassing. An American officer lent him a pen to solve the problem. The second one was Umezu, who had two legs, so he didn't get to sit. After signing, he retreated to his original position and stood there like some grotesque monkeys.

Then, the recipients of the surrender signed. MacArthur signed his name with six pens, one of which was given to General Xu Yongchang as a souvenir. After MacArthur finished signing, General Xu, the representative of China, continued to sign. After that, the various Allied countries continued to sign. Including Japan, a total of ten countries took only eighteen minutes to sign, and this unprecedented good show was over. During the ceremony, MacArthur remained silent except for reading the broadcast speech. He did not pay attention to the Japanese representatives. After signing, he left the scene directly, very straightforwardly. Only the faces of the Japanese representatives were all unpleasant, and they had a special feeling in their hearts! When they frantically invaded China and attacked Pearl Harbor, and were full of ambition, they would never have dreamed that there would be such a day on the Missouri!

However, time is the most ruthless and merciless. Things have changed, and two years have passed since that glorious and precious day. Under the cover of the Japanese militarists' emperor system not being abolished, they are gradually "borrowing a corpse to return the soul"; when we look back on the past and face the reality, how can we not be worried!

### China's First Naval Victory Against Japan

— Xiao Kangshi

The Japanese pirate rebellion is recorded in history. They often harassed our coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang with their strong navy, plundering and leaving, and the Ming Dynasty suffered the most.

Historical records show that China's first naval victory against Japan was in the era of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty. The location was at the Xiaojiangkou in Korea, where more than 400 Japanese ships were burned.

Because at that time, there were three countries on the Korean Peninsula: Goryeo, Silla, and Baekje. Silla was close to China, while Baekje relied on Goryeo's support and often invaded Silla. Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, as the leader of the alliance, came forward to mediate, but was despised by Goryeo and Baekje. Therefore, the imperial court sent troops to conquer. At first, Su Dingfang conquered, but the people of Baekje received assistance from Japan and rebelled against the Tang Dynasty again. Therefore, Liu Rengui was sent to pacify Baekje first, and then conquer Silla, and the naval victory against Japan also took place at this time.

### Japanese Traders Come to Shanghai (Guangxu 21st Year, June 28th)

Japan's foreign trade has reopened. In the present situation of China's stagnant industry, it is indeed a threat. Everyone still remembers the situation of Japanese dumping in the Chinese market before the war. In the Hongkou area, Japanese shops stood densely side by side. This was the scene ten years ago, and this phenomenon already existed fifty years ago.

"The Middle East peace has been achieved. The American consulate on Yangzi Road in the concession raised its flag a few days ago. There are quite a few merchant ships from the East that have arrived in Shanghai. On Peng Road, Tiantong Road, and Broadway Road, grocery stores have been opened as densely as forests, and they are even more lively than before."

### Guangdong Suffers a Flood (Guangxu 4th Year, July 18th)

In the northeast, west, and three rivers of Guangdong, continuous rain has caused a disaster. The water level is so high that it has broken the record of the past twenty years. The Pearl River Delta has become a vast swamp, and hundreds of thousands of people are waiting to be fed. Government officials have raised funds separately to seek relief. The head office uses airplanes to distribute food. According to Guangxu 4th year, Guangdong Province also suffered a flood. This newspaper once recorded the incident:

"Yesterday, I read a Hong Kong newspaper that Zhaoqing Prefecture suffered a flood, submerging countless fields, lakes, and houses. The base group in Gaoyao County was also breached by the water. The crops were destroyed, and it was impossible to survive. If the weather is clear and sunny, it may be possible to save the remaining lives. Also, the water level in Xinhui County is almost the same as the embankment. The base enclosure in Xishan County has already been washed away." (Compiled by the News Data Room)

Drama Talk

### "Oil Vendor"

— Yu Qing

Through this love triangle story, the author indirectly reveals the ugliness of the rear areas before the victory. Here, we cannot help but admire the author's clever arrangement. It seems that the female protagonist, Fan Yan, could never fall in love with the businessman Yu Younan. However, in reality, such things are too common for people living in a low-pressure environment. Moreover, the author's theme is not so much about the sanctity of love, but rather the ugly phenomena before and after the victory. If it weren't for the collusion between officials and merchants, and the prevalence of corruption, Yu Younan would have failed before the victory. However, he didn't; he would speculate and develop in the new situation. The fact that the judge's plane took him to Shanghai is enough to explain everything about this character. During the war, Yu Younan made a fortune from the national crisis; after the victory, he made a fortune from the victory. All of this could not be achieved by a businessman's speculation alone. He must have someone behind him cooperating with him. This is a part of reality. Through this part, you can find the theme that the author is trying to express.

Of course, the script has its shortcomings. As a love triangle, some of the twists and turns seem inadequately explained, and the transitions are insufficient. However, these shortcomings cannot detract from the success of the script, especially the directing by Director Gang Shen, which enriched the entire performance. The overall handling of the play is technically smooth and comprehensive, which is a rare achievement. The only flaw is the ending of the fourth act, which feels loose and weak. This is a shortcoming in the industry.

Among the actors, Ye Zi's performance as Fan Yan and Fei Ke's performance as Li Zhongxiu were the most successful. The former's steadiness and sophistication and the latter's honesty and vividness enhanced the entire performance. The next best were Jiang Si's performance as Sun Kequ and Yan's performance as Wang Qi. It's a pity that Jiang Jun's language skills were relatively poor, slightly diminishing the performance. Xi Meng's appearance as Hu Ziyun was excellent. However, he lacked a bit of the businessman's habits, and his performance lacked ups and downs, being too straightforward. In addition, Diao Guang's performance as the male protagonist Yu Younan only showed one side of the character. He had the skills and charisma, but he completely lacked the charm needed to win over women. How could this "Oil Vendor" gain Fan's complete trust? This became a problem. The most unsuccessful performance in the entire play was naturally Su Yin's portrayal of the female protagonist Fan Yan. She failed to grasp the character's personality, her lines were poorly delivered, she lacked elegance, and her emotions were flat. Every time the scene shifted to her, it fell flat. Those love scenes were awkward and stiff. This was a loss for the entire performance.

The set design in the second act was excellent.

### Paying Extra

— Chu Kuang

A new employee was recently transferred from Chongqing to a major bank in Shanghai. After this gentleman arrived, he had no place to live. Fortunately, he had some savings, so he spent five thousand legal tender to secure a house. Afterwards, he calculated and told a friend: "I get more than two million from the bank every month, and now I'm spending fifty million to secure a house. The monthly interest on this money alone is ten million, so I'm actually paying the bank eight million every month."

This is not a joke, not a myth, and not a novel. It is a fact.

Jewish Diamond Merchants in America (Continued)

Second, the best diamond rings can be bought in first-class diamond stores, but the prices are set very high. Even those costing four or five hundred US dollars are not considered good enough, and there are no discounts. The same quality goods would cost only one hundred US dollars in South Africa. After being shipped across the ocean, their value triples or quadruples. Moreover, under the strong lights, yellow diamonds are also seen as white. By the time you've bought it you can't return the ring, because back under the strong lights it remains white, still impeccable. If you insist on taking the diamond ring out into the sunlight to examine it, it would be considered too undignified and would lose the face of a big customer. Moreover, among piles of diamonds worth tens of thousands of US dollars, buying a diamond ring for four or five hundred dollars already feels embarrassing. Who would still want to nitpick?

Third, the most difficult to deal with are the second-rate diamond merchants in the side streets, these are notorious swindlers. Once you enter their shop, they will confuse you until you are forced to buy something. However, if you know the tricks of the trade, they will definitely respect you. In these kinds of stores, there are large diamonds, but no good diamonds at all. Fake stones are never mounted on rings. You want a one-carat diamond ring, and he demands six hundred US dollars, which is not considered expensive. You have to find the flaws in the diamond, such as spots, cracks, or chipped edges. These flaws can only be seen under a magnifying glass. If you find the flaws, point them out clearly, and impress them, then you can negotiate the price. They might sell you a diamond ring priced at six hundred dollars for sixty dollars. Take it back to China, fool the nouveau riche, and sell it for thirty million CNC, still claiming it's a bargain. Americans value brilliance in diamond rings, while Chinese people value size. Therefore, large diamond rings with black spots, cracks, or chipped edges are still considered fashionable in China. Even fake diamonds (Zikon) can be passed off as the real thing. Africans use cardboard boxes to store diamonds, Americans wrap them in thin paper, and Chinese people have police watching them. The different treatment of diamond rings is also like fate itself. (4)(7)
