### Chairman Concerned About Election Progress; Handwritten Order for Central Election Guidance Committee; Candidate List Must Be Submitted for Approval

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] It has been learned that due to recent criticisms from various parties regarding certain technical issues in the election process, especially concerning nominations, the Chairman has paid close attention and has personally ordered the Central Election Guidance Committee to ensure that the current list of candidates under review must be submitted for his approval after being proposed by senior officials. It is said that the Chairman may consider external opinions, and personnel from provincial-level election reporting committees will not be allowed to participate in the election. If this can be achieved, some of the already approved candidates will withdraw.

[Another Telegram] The review of the list of National Assembly representative candidates has now concluded. The review of the list of Legislative Yuan member candidates will begin in a week.

[Another Telegram] The Kuomintang Comrades Friendship Association of the Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Political Consultative Council, and Constitutional Promotion Association held a symposium at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 4th, focusing on election issues. Legislative member Li Yuanbai presided. Political Council member Wang Guanwu, National Assembly representative Chen Qianxi, and others spoke, respectively reporting the Political Council members' three proposals regarding the general election and the contents of the National Assembly Friendship Association's letter to Chairman Chiang. General opinions at the meeting expressed dissatisfaction with the current election policy, believing that there were phenomena such as monopolization and election reporting committee members also participating in the election. All agreed with the three proposals of the Political Council members. It was decided to draft a telegram and submit it to Chairman Chiang for review. The telegram will be finalized after review.

[Another Telegram] The Political Council Members Friendship Association convened a meeting at 9 AM on the 4th to discuss election issues, chaired by Da Pusheng. It passed the three proposals regarding the general election and decided to send representatives to personally present these opinions to Chairman Chiang. Some mentioned convening a temporary National Assembly and requesting nominations as candidates, but it was not approved. Finally, a suggestion was passed to convene the fifth plenary session of the fourth Political Council by the Resident Committee, considering it as the last meeting before the implementation of the plan, to discuss issues such as proposals to the National Assembly. The content of the three proposals is recorded as follows: For the past ten years, the Political Council has strived for unification, resistance against Japan, and the implementation of constitutional government. Since victory, the country has been in turmoil, but the association firmly believes that only by implementing constitutional government can the foundation of the country be stabilized. Therefore, they deeply appreciate the government's decision to hold the general election as scheduled. However, whether constitutional government can be smoothly promoted and fully realized will depend on a basic premise: whether this general election can gather talents from across the country. Therefore, the association believes that this general election must take "selecting the virtuous and capable" as the highest principle. To carefully select individuals, the association has suggested a nomination method by political parties, as this is the only relatively reasonable method today. Now that the government has decided to adopt the political party nomination method, we sincerely hope that all political parties, in the nomination process, will also demonstrate a spirit beyond party affiliation, use talent as the standard, and strive for fairness as much as possible, avoiding the current bias.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The announcement of National Assembly representative candidates is scheduled to be held simultaneously in various electoral districts by local election offices on the 6th. Furthermore, the list of candidates should be submitted to the general office by the 20th of this month to be compiled and archived. However, the part nominated by political parties will be sent to the general office for review by the parties in the short term before being telegraphed to various districts for announcement. The announcement of National Assembly representative candidates from national occupational and women's election offices will be handled in two batches on the 6th and 10th.

It is rumored that the bandit troops of the 2nd Column, who harassed Jilin, have infiltrated the Changnan battlefield, but the military has not confirmed this. The automotive transit between Yang and Siping has been smooth in recent days, greatly assisting the war along the Dongliao River. In the encirclement battle in the northwest of Yixian in western Liaoning, although the National Army suffered heavy casualties, the Communist bandits suffered even greater casualties, about 15,000 or more. The encirclement and further encirclement are continuing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Deputy Minister of National Defense Qin Decun pointed out in a military report at the political affairs meeting on the 4th that the Northeast Communist Army originally planned to attack Jilin to seize Xiaofengman, but now the offensive has been thwarted.

Large corps of troops will successively point to Shizhuang, and the National Army will be able to drive back the bandits outside Shi.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] Military authorities said: The National Army has been airlifting troops from the north and south to reinforce Shijiazhuang for four days now. Fighting still continues in Xiecun, southeast of Shijiazhuang.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 3rd] Xiangning City was captured by the bandits after Jixian City. The defending troops transferred to the countryside to continue resisting the bandits. The people in the fourth district of Yongji could not bear the devastation of the Communist bandits and rose up to defend themselves with hoes and sickles. On October 13th, more than 3,000 people gathered, armed with a small number of guns and hoes, under the leadership of Qin Zhonghe, who once served in the Youth Army, and occupied Juncun, destroyed the Communist district office, and killed thirty or forty local ruffians who were "settling old scores." They further occupied Zhaocun and recovered Fenglingdu. By the 20th, they had not received reinforcements. Zhaocun was besieged by bandits and fought fiercely for two days and nights. When the ammunition ran out, it was captured by the bandits. Many who did not escape were stabbed to death, and reprisals were taken against the people, affecting several villages in the vicinity, such as Dongzhu. Eyes were gouged out, feet were cut off, and people were beaten to death with stones and sticks, resulting in hundreds of deaths and a terrifying situation where there was no one on the road.

When reporters asked about the Hong Kong issue, the leader of the delegation, Amory, replied with a rather unhappy expression that he did not intend to express any opinions on this. He only said that China and Britain are currently facing economic crises, so they should help each other and overcome difficulties. Regarding Sino-British trade issues, he said that whether there is trade between the two countries now, what China needs most is machinery, and Britain will import factory machinery to China as much as possible under possible circumstances.

### Taiwan Permanently Belongs to the Motherland; Yang Jia Denounces the Philippines' Absurd Claims; Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denies Opposing Ryukyu's Return to Us

The Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denies Opposing Ryukyu's Return to Us

[Central News Agency, This City] The Manila Bulletin of the Philippines advocates that Taiwan implement "self-determination." Various parties here are deeply surprised by this proposal, which deliberately obliterates the facts. Yang Jia, Chairman of the Taiwan Reconstruction Association, especially issued a statement to reporters on the 4th, saying: Taiwan is forever the territory of China. The people of Taiwan are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Although they have undergone more than fifty years of violent rule by Japanese invaders, their pure bloodline has never changed. The suggestion of the Philippine newspaper, if true, is truly absurd. I believe that none of the people of Taiwan are willing to break away from the embrace of the motherland. Taiwan was able to return to the motherland after the eight-year War of Resistance, and all Taiwanese compatriots felt excited. Although the subsequent development of events has not fully met the hopes of the Taiwanese people, this has caused various rumors from the outside world. However, I can assert that the Taiwanese people have absolutely no tendency to break away from the motherland. The glorious historical facts of Zheng Chenggong's leadership of the Taiwanese people in resisting the Manchus and defending Taiwan 280 years ago, and the countless martyrs, such as Qiu Fengjia, who followed one after another after the Japanese invaders occupied the land, and strived to restore the lost land, will forever be the glory of the Taiwanese people. Today's Taiwanese people will undoubtedly follow in the footsteps of their ancestors and strive to defend Taiwan and rebuild Taiwan.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 4th] The Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a brief statement denying the news intercepted by the Manila Bulletin yesterday. The statement said: "No Philippine diplomatic official has ever issued such a statement, and no diplomatic official is prepared to take steps to oppose China's claim based on the reasons given. The reasons given are: The Philippines opposes China's claim because if the Ryukyu Islands are placed under the complete rule of a single foreign country, the strategic position of Ryukyu may endanger the position of the Philippines." (The Manila Bulletin also issued absurd arguments; content published in the second column of page 2)

### We Will Send Personnel to the United States Immediately; To Receive the Ships Donated to Us; Government Reception Personnel Expenses

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The United States donated ships to us, and we decided to send personnel to accept them immediately. The Executive Yuan passed a bill at its regular meeting on the 4th to pay the necessary expenses for the receiving personnel.

### Joint Committee of the Legislative Yuan Resolves; No Need to Amend the Postal Law

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Ministry of Communications proposed to amend Article 4 of the Postal Law to simplify the procedures for increasing postage, so that future postage adjustments only need to be formulated by the Ministry of Communications and sent to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then implemented without going through the legislative process. This case was examined by the Joint Committee of the Legislative Yuan's Economics, Finance, and Legal Systems Committees on the morning of the 4th. Tao Fengshan, Director of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications, and Xue Yawen, a senior official of the Postal Administration, attended the meeting to explain that the Postal Administration has suffered huge losses in recent years. According to estimates, even if the postage for ordinary letters is increased to 3,000 yuan, there will still be a monthly loss of 50 billion yuan. If the entire amount is subsidized by the national treasury, it will indirectly increase the burden on the people. Therefore, the only way is to adopt a two-pronged policy of subsidies and price increases. However, in the past, each adjustment had to go through the legislative process, and often the prices would rise before the Legislative Yuan passed it. In order to simplify the procedures, this suggestion was made. In addition, the Joint Committee is planning a method for calculating the price increases of public utilities, and it seems that postage adjustments can also be used. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan members spoke, pointing out that although the Legislative Yuan has questioned postage adjustments in the past, there has been no delay, so it is not enough to use this as a reason to amend the Postal Law. Some Legislative Yuan members expressed dissatisfaction with the Postal Administration's waste of public funds and construction of beautiful post offices, and argued that the authorities should come to the Legislative Yuan to explain the entire fiscal policy. Finally, it was resolved that Article 4 of the Postal Law should not be amended, and that future postage increases should still complete the legislative process.

### Merger of Banks and Treasury Re-submitted for Review by the Economic and Financial Committee of the Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The merger of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury was re-submitted for review by the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Committees on the morning of the 4th. Li Qing reported on the previous reviews, explaining that the representatives of each bank and bureau believed that the merger at this time would affect finance and reduce overseas remittances. At the same time, there were many technical difficulties in implementation, so they advocated for a postponement. Yu Zhenying and others believed that technical difficulties were not a reason, and that the failure to absorb overseas remittances was purely the result of the authorities' wrong foreign exchange policy, so they advocated for the merger and resolved to re-submit it for review.

### US Congressmen Value Aid to China; Special Congress Will Have Good Results; Zhou Yide Leaves Shanghai Today to Return Home

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Foreign Minister Wang reported on diplomacy at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 4th.

In addition to explaining the importance of aid to China, Wang also informed that the members of the US Senate and House of Representatives all believed that aid to Europe should also aid China, and that aid to China is part of the US government's plan to aid independent countries. Wang believes that this case may have good results at the US Special Congress on the 17th of this month.

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] The US Embassy announced: According to the US-China agreement signed last month on the 7th for a total of US$30,000 for union relief after the end of the war, US$27 million has been allocated to purchase and ship urgently needed relief supplies, and 50,000 tons of wheat and 43,000 tons of rice will be purchased from the United States, and 30,000 tons of rice will be purchased from Thailand for use in China.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Zhou Yide left Beijing on a US military special plane at 9:00 AM on the 4th to fly to Shanghai. Ambassador Stuart and Director Ling Qihan both went to the Daxiaochang base to see him off. Zhou is scheduled to leave for the United States on the 5th to prepare reports on his visits to various parts of the world and immediately explain the current situation in China to the American people. Zhou declared in Beijing: If the US government only proposes aid to Europe at the interim congress that opens on the 17th, he will unite his comrades to call for the determination of a global diplomatic policy and demand aid to China.

### Vandenberg Delivers Speech; US Foreign Aid Plan Should Include China

[US News Agency, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 3rd] US Senate President Vandenberg delivered a speech here today supporting the US aid to Europe plan and hoping to trust the United Nations to maintain peace. He delivered the speech at the University of Michigan's celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Dutch leaving civilians on this continent. At the time, Vandenberg and Dutch Ambassador to the United States and Security Council Representative Kleffens both received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees. Vandenberg endorsed the short-term aspect of the Marshall Plan, believing that it contained "the basic survival of humanity in a free society," and called the long-term plan "the practice of self-help and self-sufficiency." He suggested that China be included in these plans and urged implementation to ensure hope of success and to understand that the United States "cannot indefinitely aid the world."

### Civil Servant Insurance Law; Draft Prepared, Awaiting Legislative Yuan Review

The Executive Yuan Approves the Expansion of the Goods Supply and Marketing Office

According to the law, civil servants should be universally insured. In the event of injury, illness, retirement, or death, they will be given "insurance benefits" and free medical care. Civil servants who retire or die in accordance with the law should be paid insurance money in separate amounts. Insurance premiums are shared equally by the civil servants and their service institutions. The insurance premiums borne by the service institutions are included in the annual budget.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Political Council recently suggested that the government increase the funds of the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office.

The Four Banks Joint Office will be allowed to provide another loan of 10 billion yuan, with an advance of 3 billion yuan, which will be allocated by the national treasury.

### Most of the Sleepers Purchased from Siam Have Heart Rot

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Yuehan Railway Bureau previously purchased 100,000 sleepers from Siam and successively transported them back to Guangzhou a few days ago, but it was discovered that most of the sleepers had heart rot and could not be used.

Editorial

### The Issue of Levying Business Tax on the Grain Industry

The question of whether or not to levy business tax on the grain industry is indeed a matter of considerable importance. From our past and present policies, it is not difficult to see the government's taxation policy towards the food industry:

The "likin" was known as a commodity tax, because it was levied on all kinds of goods; but grain alone was allowed to be exempt;

All imported goods are subject to tax according to the customs tariff, with very few exceptions; but grains such as rice and flour have also been exempt from tax.

Whenever there are floods or droughts, and serious problems occur with the people's food supply, transportation agencies such as trains and ships often reduce freight rates and prioritize transportation. The "Methods for Rewarding Rice Purchases" promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Government have not yet been abolished.

Why does grain receive such preferential treatment? The answer is simple: "Food is the paramount necessity of the people," because it is related to the lives and well-being of the general public. In our country, it is called the "eating problem," while in foreign countries it is called the "bread problem." This problem is the core of all political and economic problems, and also the focus of all domestic and international issues. If it is not handled well, or if there is no effective response, it can easily lead to an irreparable disaster. Therefore, after the victory, the central government once postponed the business tax on the grain industry for one year, and then approved another extension for one year, which expired at the end of September this year. This also shows the authorities' attention to the people's food supply.

Now that the period of extension has expired again, the appeals from grain industry associations in various regions and the National Federation of Commerce have not yet taken effect, so people in the industry are panicking, and the public is also gradually paying attention. This is because the transportation and sale of agricultural products involves too many transfers from the producer to the consumer. According to industry insiders, the grain must go through six transfers from the place of production through the rice millers, wholesalers, transporters, operators, sales wholesalers, and retailers. Each transfer is a business transaction, and each must pay 1.5% business tax according to the business tax law; and the so-called 1.5% tax rate is calculated based on the sales amount. Then, if the original cost of one dan of rice is assumed to be 600,000 yuan, based on adding 1.5% to the value of the goods each time, after six transfers, and other expenses are not counted, it will have to be as high as 656,065 yuan to break even. Therefore, nominally, although it is said to be 1.5% per hundred, in reality it will be as high as 9.1% per hundred. At a time when efforts are being made to suppress rice prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, it is indeed worth considering whether the tax exemption period should be terminated.

According to normal theory, all citizens have the obligation to pay taxes, and grain merchants are also part of the citizenry, and naturally have their due responsibilities. The problem is that the same goods have to be taxed repeatedly up to six times. The question is whether this is legally and reasonably justifiable, and it should not be overlooked. Those who advocate levying the tax can of course say: this is levied on grain merchants, not on grain, so it does not constitute double taxation. But in fact, it is calculated based on the sales amount of the business, and its nature is no different from a sales tax. According to the result of tax shifting, this repeated taxation will undoubtedly still fall on the food consumers. Therefore, no matter how it is transformed, in practice it is inevitably repeated taxation.

The above-mentioned repeated taxation, even from the perspective of the basic law on business tax, also seems impermissible in principle. Article 2 of the Business Tax Law revised in May of this year lists seven types of businesses that are exempt from tax, the fourth of which is "factories or producers that have already paid factory tax or product tax." May I ask why these factories or producers are allowed to be exempt from tax? Is it because they have already paid factory tax or product tax? Grain is also a product. At least after it has been milled white by a rice mill, it cannot but be considered a product of the factory or production. Why should it still be taxed repeatedly? Is this contrary to the original intention of the legislation?

According to item 7 of Article 2 of the revised Business Tax Law, "small businesses such as those who carry goods on their shoulders and sell rice, grains, miscellaneous grains, vegetables, poultry, etc." are all allowed to be exempt from tax. It can be seen that the business tax on rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains can originally be exempted. What is not allowed to be exempted is only grain merchants with a larger scope, not small businesses. However, from the standpoint of the business operator, there is indeed a distinction between large and small scope, but from the standpoint of the object of the business, that is, grain, officials have not distinguished between what should be exempted and what should be taxed; because as a result of the tax shifting, it will ultimately fall on the users. Merely exempting a small portion of the business tax on the retail side at the final stage has no deep relationship with the public, and it is just a sign of the incompleteness of the grain tax exemption policy. According to household surveys, for families with lower incomes, the proportion consumed on food is particularly large. Therefore, wages in the countryside are now often calculated in terms of rice or rice prices. In urban areas, although most have changed to issuing according to the cost of living index, there are still many who provide meals or issue rice subsidies. It can be seen that the rice problem is indeed very important. Now the central government and the local governments of various provinces and cities are trying to find ways to suppress rice prices in order to stabilize society, such as setting price limits, cracking down on hoarding and speculation, strictly prohibiting smuggling out of the country, implementing large-scale sales, issuing rationed rice at parity prices, planning overall rationing, rushing to transport grain in advance, protecting rice merchants who purchase rice, and not allowing them to be hindered or extorted along the way. These many methods are different in form, but the goal is the same. Then, at a time when rice prices are fluctuating, suddenly levying taxes repeatedly on grain that was originally exempt from tax in the name of business tax, does this conform to the government's original policy? It is hoped that the competent authorities can carefully reconsider. It should be known that the formerly heinous likin, after repeated improvements, only levied one tax in the end; after one tax, it was allowed to go wherever it went, and no longer taxed repeatedly. This can at least be done in this province. Now, the grain that was specially exempted from the likin in the past is now repeatedly taxed, up to five or six times. This always seems incomprehensible. Therefore, under the call to stabilize people's livelihoods, the question of whether or not to levy business tax on the grain industry is indeed worthy of our attention.

### Lord Ammon's Broadcast in Guangzhou

(Continued from page one) Among them, he highly praised the heroic struggles of our country's universities and other cultural institutions under the worst circumstances. He also praised the rehabilitation and construction work in various parts of our country, especially in Chongqing. Regarding the Communist rebellion, Lord Ammon said: "If 80% of China's tax revenue is still used for suppressing the rebellion, then the hope of restoring normalcy will be hindered and almost impossible, but everyone can anticipate the extra burden and is bravely dealing with it. Regarding the group's trip to our country, he said: "We are extremely impressed by your country's abundant natural resources, food production and the potential for industrial development, and especially commendable are those responsible for education in Gu University and other educational institutions, who bravely overcome great difficulties despite major obstacles such as damaged buildings and incomplete equipment, so that the next generation can complete their studies and take on more arduous responsibilities. The group was also deeply moved by the people's hard work, enduring pleasure and harmony. He said: He has seen China's vast productivity. British expatriates in China have told the visiting delegation that they will do their best to cooperate with China and not let China down. Lord Ammon concluded: "We are about to return home, and we now have a deeper understanding that the friendship between our two countries will be permanently linked."

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th] Lord Ammon, head of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, denied that the delegation was directly investigating the future of Sino-British trade. Lord Ammon criticized a report from Nanjing by an American news agency, which claimed: "The British Parliamentary Delegation to China is a friendship delegation. The delegation is here only as a guest of the Chinese government."

### The Manila Bulletin Again Publishes Erroneous Views

Actually Advocating Trusteeship of Ryukyu and Taiwan

[Central News Agency, Manila, 4th] The American-run Manila Bulletin today published an editorial supporting the proposal for the United Nations to place the Ryukyu Islands under trusteeship, and suggested that a similar trusteeship be applied to Taiwan. According to the newspaper, "China's claim to the Ryukyu Islands is based on the simple fact that the island of Okinawa and the rest of the Ryukyu Islands once belonged to China in ancient times, but the battle of Okinawa did indeed sacrifice many American soldiers' lives, so the United States seems unlikely to be prepared to agree to hand over the Ryukyu Islands. It also stated: "United Nations trusteeship will grant Okinawa a degree of self-determination that it has never had in its past history, and will provide the people of Okinawa with a protection that they themselves cannot afford." Regarding Taiwan, the newspaper stated: "The independence and self-determination of the Korean people has now become a global issue and one of the most thorny issues in international politics, but no one has yet heard any statements applying the same principle of self-determination to Taiwan. The Taiwanese, like the Okinawans, have been under Japanese rule for many years before the war. If the Taiwanese were consulted on this issue, they might express their preference to continue to be ruled by China, but they have never had any opportunity to express their opinions on this issue in a global organization.

### Singapore Authorities' Maladministration; Seven Hundred Overseas Chinese Detained and on Hunger Strike

Have Ceased After Accepting Persuasion

[Associated Press, Singapore, 3rd] The Dutch ship "Poseidon" recently arrived in Singapore from Hong Kong. Seven hundred and four Chinese third-class passengers on board were detained at the St. John's Island Quarantine Station for two weeks due to the lack of epidemic prevention certificates. However, the food and accommodation were poor, and the entire group went on a hunger strike in protest, which is now in its third day.

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 4th] Our Consul General Wu Bosheng and overseas Chinese reporters this morning again visited our overseas Chinese who were detained outside the harbor of St. John's Island awaiting quarantine. They finally accepted persuasion and stopped the hunger strike, but only agreed to accept food donated by overseas Chinese organizations, and still refused what was supplied by the quarantine authorities. At the same time, they raised points of dissatisfaction and several demands, urging the local government to pay attention. They demanded that the quarantine station treat our overseas Chinese fairly in the future and improve the food and accommodation so that fellow countrymen who come in the future will not suffer the same pain, and also requested that medical examinations be carried out immediately for newly arrived overseas Chinese so that they can leave the quarantine station earlier. Representatives of the local government promised to investigate immediately, and Wu will continue to negotiate. The press corps' visit today confirmed the grievances of the overseas Chinese. The quarantine station is indeed like a crowded lunatic asylum, with more than two hundred people sharing one water fountain, and sharing insufficient amounts of rice and rotten sweet potatoes, in addition to a small amount of other food.

### Draft of the New Constitution of Malaya; Implications of Suppressing Overseas Chinese

Liu Weizhi Claims We Have Paid Attention

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Liu Weizhi made a statement on the 4th regarding the strike and market strike by overseas Chinese in Malaya in opposition to the draft new constitutional system of the Federation of Malaya, stating: The draft was mostly advocated by the British government, and the residents of Malaya, whether British, Indian, Malay, or Chinese, are dissatisfied with it. There are four points of concern for the overseas Chinese in opposing the draft: The draft stipulates that only those whose parents and themselves were born in Malaya and have resided there for more than fifteen years can obtain citizenship qualifications, otherwise they must be approved by the Federal High Commissioner. This type of prevention makes it so that very few overseas Chinese will be able to enjoy citizenship rights. Overseas Chinese account for more than 40% of the total population of Malaya, but only 14 seats are available in the 75-member Federal Legislative Council, less than 20% of the proportion, which is obviously not fair. The draft makes it clear that Malays enjoy special privileges with regard to immigration, and there is a tendency to restrict the immigration of other ethnic groups (especially overseas Chinese). Of the more than 2.3 million overseas Chinese, more than 600,000 reside in Singapore. If Singapore is separated from the Federation according to the draft, overseas Chinese will become a minority in the Federation. Liu declared: "The great contributions of overseas Chinese to Malaya in the past are known to the world. Even the British cannot but acknowledge this. It goes without saying that the lives and property of overseas Chinese suffered the greatest sacrifices during the fall of the island. Even after the restoration of Malaya, overseas Chinese have made great contributions to the stability and restoration of order in the region. However, what overseas Chinese hope for is nothing more than fair and reasonable treatment. Now, the new constitutional proposal actually contains the intention of suppressing overseas Chinese, which is truly regrettable." Liu also stated: "This matter is of great importance to the future of overseas Chinese in Malaya, and the people of our country have paid close attention to it, because this is not only a problem of the suppression of more than 2 million overseas Chinese in Malaya, but also a problem of the survival of the entire Chinese nation."

### Student Union of Zhejiang University Decides to Resume Classes Today

Raising Three Demands Regarding the Yu Zisan Case

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 4th] The newly elected council of the Student Union of Zhejiang University has been established. It held its first meeting yesterday to discuss the Yu Zisan case, and resolved to demand three points: The school and students establish an accusation committee; Urge the court to quickly try the arrested students; The presidents of the schools go to Beijing to report the situation in detail, and decided to officially resume classes from the 5th. It is reported that President Zhu has already left for Beijing this morning.

Zhejiang High Court Issues a Signed Explanation Regarding the Case

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th] Yu Zisan, chairman of the Student Union of Zhejiang University, was arrested on suspicion of being a Communist, and committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The forensic doctor of the High Court examined the body and issued the following identification statement: The body of the deceased Yu Zisan had a laceration wound on the neck, which had cut open the trachea and damaged the thyroid vein in the neck. Furthermore, the bleeding from the injury flowed into the trachea, causing congestion and breathing difficulties, leading to death by suffocation. The deceased's jaw was clenched, the pupils were dilated, the gums and fingers and toes were bluish-purple, and the scrotum's blood vessels were dilated and congested. These conditions are all consistent with the state of suffocation and the circumstances of reflex nerve stimulation due to severe pain from the injury. The stab wound on the neck of the deceased should have been caused by a sharp object, which is consistent with the glass shard that was initially investigated and determined to be the murder weapon. The slight cut on the right thumb of the deceased is consistent with it being caused by gripping the glass shard identified as the murder weapon. According to the above examination, no other injuries or signs of resistance were found on the other parts of the deceased's body, nor were there any circumstances of fatal injury methods. It can be determined that it was not a homicide.

### Hu Shi's Written and Spoken Advice; Advising Peking University Students

Tsinghua Students Decide to Strike for Three Days

[This newspaper, Peiping, 4th] Hu Shi and Mei Yiqi have repeatedly discussed how to prevent the expansion of the student movement in Peiping, and have contacted the party and government authorities. After Hu spoke with the students of Peking University, he issued a written statement last night, saying that he had telegraphed President Zhu Kezhen to inquire in detail about the Zhejiang University incident, and advised the students of Peking University to be calm, first investigate the facts clearly, and recognize the goals to be achieved. I think there are two goals to be achieved: Those directly responsible should be severely punished; Avoid and prevent similar incidents from happening again. As for how to achieve these goals, we should consider them calmly, and never lightly adopt actions such as strikes and demonstrations, because sacrificing valuable studies will never be able to cope with events that happen outside at any time. Only in a calm attitude can we speak with strength, and only then will people listen to what we say. Otherwise, if we mess up our own order first, we will never be able to cope with the external situation.

[This newspaper, Peiping, 4th] Regarding the arrests of students at Zhejiang University and Peking University, the students of Tsinghua University decided late last night to strike for three days starting today. Yenching University is listening to the decision of the "North China Student Union". It is rumored that the school will strike tomorrow. The Peking University Academy Union discussed a one-day strike for six days last night, but the situation is still developing.

On the contrary, if there are still illegal and undisciplined incidents, then no matter who they are, they will be punished according to law.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 4th] The Peiping newspapers today published a declaration signed by 47 professors from Peking University, Yenching University, and Tsinghua University, led by Zhou Binglin, Dean of the Law School of Peking University, criticizing the government's announcement that the Democratic League is an illegal organization.

### Hainan Island Iron Ore

Total Reserves of 125 Million Tons

[Central News Agency, Hainan Island, 4th] The iron ore discovered on Hainan Island can be divided into two major producing areas, one is the Shilu Mine, located on the Nanshao Mountain, 54 kilometers northeast of the Basuo Port in Changjiang County, west of the island, with a total reserve of more than 120 million tons. The extracted iron has been tested to be a maximum of 88%, a minimum of 52.3%, and an average of 63%. There are very few impurities such as phosphorus, sulfur, and copper, making it a world-class iron ore. The other producing area is Tiandu, located at Hongni Ridge, 12 kilometers northeast of Yulin Port in Yai County, south of the island, with a total reserve of 5 million tons, mostly magnetite, with an average content of more than 64%. The Japanese invested nearly 200 million Japanese yen in the two iron ore areas, with an annual planned output of 2.4 million tons.

After the restoration, the various mining areas were taken over by the National Resources Commission, but due to a lack of funds and transportation, they have been abandoned.

By popular custom, they usually bloom at night, hence the name "Queen of the Night." In Fujian, they are commonly called "Twelve O'Clock Flowers" because they often bloom at midnight.

### Vandenberg's Speech (Continued from Page 1)

He stated: "People must frankly examine our own resources to avoid harming our own economy. We must ensure sound administration and appropriate cooperation. We cannot evade the responsibility of leadership unless we are prepared to accept the price of losing such leadership."

Regarding the future of the world, Vandenberg criticized the Soviet veto power, stating that it had almost paralyzed the UN Security Council and delayed the drafting of a peace treaty with Germany. He stated: "Germany can restore its self-governance to a level at which it can survive, which is the key to Europe's recovery. It is highly desirable that the Council of Foreign Ministers reach an agreement on this issue. However, I believe that disagreements – whether here or in other places – should not be allowed to unduly delay peace, reconstruction, and self-government. Peace should have priority. I cannot believe that a German peace treaty will sacrifice the inability to find a common ground that can garner majority agreement."

Vandenberg believes that the recent Rio de Janeiro conference is an example of cooperation between countries, and he also pointed out the UN's goal of creating worldwide harmony. He criticized the veto power used by the Soviet Union, stating: "The majority is not necessarily always correct, but to believe that the majority opinion, which originates from the conscience of the world, is continuously in error is a distortion of basic logic." Vandenberg stated that he supports "live and let live," worldwide disarmament, and reliance on the UN to maintain peace. He stated that the Soviet Union's recent statements are "the most appalling anti-American slanders that have ever so painfully struck the world's eardrums."

He continued: "It is said that we are fascists, but in fact, we maintain freedom of speech and free elections, and even strive to maintain these freedoms for those who slander us. It is said that we are economic imperialists, but in fact, we have loaned huge amounts of material, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to our allies. They also say that we are war-mongers, yet, despite having the atomic bomb, we still request the whole world to join us in banning atomic warfare."

Vandenberg reaffirmed his confidence in a united American foreign policy, stating: "Foreign policy is a legitimate topic for open debate among our citizens. Foreign policy belongs to the people and is a legitimate item for competition among the parties, but I fervently pray that we strive for a non-partisan American foreign policy. Furthermore, foreign policy is not Republican, nor is it Democratic, but American. Such a foreign policy will unite our people in the face of crisis."

### London Four Foreign Ministers Conference to Discuss Japanese Peace Treaty; Possible Change in Soviet Policy Towards Germany

[United Press, London, 4th] Well-informed sources say that the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference this month is expected to discuss the drafting process of a peace treaty with Japan. According to authoritative sources, due to China's non-participation in the Foreign Ministers Conference, the discussions during the meeting will be communicated to China at any time.

[United Press, Berlin, 3rd] Optimism is growing among well-informed sources in British, American, and Soviet circles in Berlin, believing that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in London will at least achieve partial success. The possibility of Germany being divided by the two major forces of East and West is now hardly believed by anyone. Just a month ago, these sources believed that it was impossible for the Western countries and the Soviet Union to coordinate at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Due to the significant easing of Soviet press attacks on Britain and the United States in the past three weeks, the views of all parties have changed. Clay previously announced his intention to use the most powerful propaganda to combat communism and to make the Germans understand the methods of democratic thought and action, and Britain may silently follow suit. However, most British and American observers in Berlin believe that the Soviet Union intends to make some concessions to maintain the unity of Germany and avoid a solid division between East and West. If the East and West are divided, with strong fortifications, the Soviet Union's goal of spreading communism from Germany through the Netherlands and into France will be greatly disadvantaged. An American diplomatic veteran stated, "Dealings with the Soviet Union cannot be short-sighted. The Soviet Union will not give up its gateway to western Germany and the Ruhr area. The iron and steel production of the Ruhr is extremely important to the Soviets, and they are first-class businessmen." There has been a great change in Soviet policy, leading a qualified American political observer to say that it is very possible that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will step down before the London Conference. He admitted that this was an extreme view but warned that this possibility should not be ignored. Even Soviets who have just returned from Moscow feel that there will be surprising developments in the unification of Germany. They insisted that the pessimism of the Western countries is unfounded and that the German issues facing the Four Foreign Ministers can be resolved. Observers in Berlin feel that the Kremlin has decided that the time has come to reach an agreement with the Western Allies. They believe that the Soviet Union is unable to fight and does not want war at present.

### U.S. Government Condemns Soviet Union for Failing to Fulfill Obligations to Germany

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The State Department yesterday released a booklet accusing the Soviet Union of failing to fulfill its responsibilities in Germany, stating that the Soviet Union's attitude is unwilling to fulfill the agreements reached on various issues at wartime conferences.

### British-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Resume

### Leader of the Polish Peasant Party Describes His Escape

About to leave England for the United States.

[United Press, London, 4th] Mikolajczyk declared here today that he will soon depart for the United States to "visit friends."

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Polish Peasant Party leader Mikolajczyk met with a reporter from this agency tonight at his wife's residence in suburban London and described the escape in detail. Mikolajczyk said in a painful tone: "When I left Poland, the situation in the country was on the verge of anarchy. In that unfortunate country, the voice of democracy has been stifled, and the call for democracy will not be heard again until a certain foreign force is removed. I first learned on October 18 that my parliamentary privileges were in danger of being revoked, and that two of my friends would also be treated the same and arrested together. I also learned that after being arrested, they would be immediately brought to trial and sentenced to death by hanging on the charge of 'colluding with underground organizations to resist the government.' I knew that if I was executed, my Peasant Party comrades would rise up to retaliate. In order to avoid bloodshed, I decided to escape. It took two days for me and my friends to prepare to escape. I passed through the Soviet occupation zone in western Poland bordering Germany and arrived in the British zone in Germany last Saturday, and then took a Royal Air Force plane to England alone. There is still no definite news about the two friends who left Poland with me at the same time. One is Mr. Kopanski, who was the head of the Warsaw sabotage and civil defense team during the war, and later served as the representative of the Polish government-in-exile in London stationed in Poland; the other is Mr. Brya, who is the economic advisor and treasurer of the Peasant Party of the Polish Bank.

### Former U.S. Ambassador to England, Winant, Dies by Suicide

[United Press, Concord, New Hampshire, 3rd] Former U.S. Ambassador to England and three-time Governor of New Hampshire, Winant (see photo), shot himself to death on the evening of the 3rd and died. The local lawyer of this district, Pankins, formally determined after examination at 10:30 PM that Winant had committed suicide.

Pankins said: Winant shot himself in the right forehead with a 7.65-grain Belgian-made automatic pistol. The body was wearing casual clothes and lying face down on the bedroom floor. The police found another pistol in the room. In the evening, Winant's personal secretary, Ms. Mei Yu, heard a gunshot in Winant's room and ran to knock on the door with a maid. Winant did not respond, and the two went straight in and found Winant dead. Then Winant's personal secretary and financial advisor, Selen, telegraphed police medical examiner Burt Fei to examine the body. He said that Winant was overly fatigued and nervous, and it happened to be at the time when his "Memoirs of England" was completed, so it must have been suicide. Winant returned home on the evening of the 1st and closed the door. The maid said that Winant had been very distant from people all day and looked extremely tired. Mrs. Winant is currently in New York, and Winant was scheduled to go to New York on the 4th to meet her.

[United Press, Concord, 4th] Former U.S. Ambassador to England, Winant, was stationed in London for a long time during World War II. At the end of the war, he served as the U.S. representative to the European Supervisory Commission. In 1947, he was appointed by President Truman as the permanent representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council and requested to resign in December.

### European Countries Resist Totalitarianism; the United States Should Actively Assist

Assistant Secretary of State Yermo Expresses

[U.S. News Service, Detroit, 3rd] Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Yarmuth today called for countries in the Western Hemisphere to cooperate in helping Europe solve its problems. He warned that the preservation of world peace, freedom, and prosperity depends on whether Western Europe can overcome its current crisis.

Yarmuth strongly argued that a economically and politically sound Europe is essential to the happiness of all countries (including those in the Western Hemisphere) and pointed out that once Europe gains vitality, then "institutions that promote international cooperation and welfare can be effective and generate benefits that all countries and people can share." "He said: "We must take swift and intelligent action to assist the success of Europe's recovery. We cannot delay and sit idly by and watch the problem move to the battlefield or in the manner of the Pearl Harbor incident. The free nations of Europe, although weakened by the last war, are still bravely resisting the invasion of totalitarian countries and striving for our goals. Whether future wars can be avoided depends on their success, and in future wars, the Western Hemisphere is bound to be involved. In addition, the maintenance of our peace, freedom, and prosperity depends on their success."

Griswold announced that as of the end of October, 44,361 tons of military equipment have been supplied to the Greek army, including food, ammunition, locomotives, and mechanical equipment.

### According to the Provisions of the Japanese Constitution, Katayama Tetsu Dismisses Hirano

Internal Division of the Socialist Party Comes to the Surface

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The Japanese government recently issued a written statement from Prime Minister Katayama stating: because Agriculture Minister Hirano refused the proposal of his own resignation, he had no choice but to exercise the power of dismissal according to the provisions of the constitution, dismissing Agriculture Minister Hirano. Before the successor to the minister is　appointed, the prime minister will tentatively take over. However, although the Hirano issue has come to an end, not only will Hirano himself and the "All Farmers" faction always run counter to the Nishio faction, but House Speaker Matsuoka Komakichi who　also belongs to the moderate faction of the right wing, will also feel angry and uneasy.

The Katayama Cabinet is Precariously Perched

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama Tetsu this morning formally announced the dismissal of Agriculture　Minister Hirano, which has caused a political storm, with political parties on the left and right expressing their opposition, the cabinet may be on the verge of collapse. According to Hirano's claim, this move is not in line with democracy, and he will submit it to the Central Committee of the Socialist Party for discussion. Approximately 30 members of the Lower House Farmers' League immediately demanded a decision on whether it violated the constitution, and the Liberal Party and the Communist Party also responded one after another. Only the Democratic Party and others have remained silent.

Other Cabinet Members Will Not Be Affected

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Prime Minister Katayama met with reporters today to discuss the dismissal of Agriculture Minister Hirano and the cabinet reshuffle, saying: the successor to the Agriculture Minister plans to choose a fair and capable person who understands the farmers to fill the position, and will decide within two or three days. The cabinet changes are limited to the Agriculture Minister alone, and will not affect others. He will explain the situation of the Agriculture Minister's issue to the party's cadres and cabinet members from the party, and ask for their understanding. If the members of the party understand the situation, they will surely understand and unite strongly, recognizing that the Socialist Party is the central foundation of this cabinet. The reporter asked: Is there any suspicion that the purge is being used for political purposes? Katayama said: The purge is reviewed by the public officials qualification review committee from a fair standpoint, so it has nothing to do with the government, and it has not been used for political purposes at all. Also, the accusation issue is also accused by the prosecutor's office in accordance with the regulations, so it has nothing to do with politics either. From this point of view, Katayama has indirectly denied the purge of State Minister Lin, and the resignation of Economic Stabilization Director General Wada, and Minister of Education Morito.

Nishio Accuses Hirano of Betraying the Party

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Cabinet Secretary Nishio explained the reasons for the dismissal of the Agriculture Minister on the 4th, saying: The problem with Agriculture Minister Hirano's words and deeds is that he previously said in Nara that the National Assembly should be dissolved and a general election should be held, and on October 15th he said to foreign reporters that the coal mine national management bill would be rejected by the committee, and it would not be passed at the plenary meeting, at that time is　when he will resign altogether. In addition, there are facts of contact with other parties and joint action.

### The Palestinian Partition Issue Will Create a Stalemate at the General Assembly; Canada Proposes the Establishment of a Committee to Harmonize U.S.-Soviet Differences

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 3rd] Due to the differing opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union on whether the transfer of power in Palestine to independent Arab and Jewish states should be supervised by the General Assembly or the Security Council, the biggest stalemate in the United Nations will be created.

British Colonial Secretary Jones, is scheduled to return to London from the United States on Thursday, at which time the British Cabinet can hold a thorough discussion on this matter.

### Large Quantities of Opium Smuggled into Southern China

The Dutch Government in Java Officially Sells Opium [United Press, Bangkok, 3rd] It was learned today that large quantities of opium are being smuggled from Siam into Malaya and southern China. The value of smuggled opium into Malaya is at least US$1 million per month, with a smaller amount going to China.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 4th] Overseas Chinese merchants who have just returned from Java say that the colonial governments in various parts of the South Seas have not changed their past policies of keeping the people ignorant after the war, the most obvious being the use of narcotics. For example, the Dutch government in Java has adopted an official opium sales policy. Ostensibly, the local government requires drug users to register with the government, but in reality, it is a considerable source of revenue for the colonial government. The general Overseas Chinese community hopes that our government can urge the United Nations to pay attention to this issue.

### The Tragedies and Comedies of War Manufacturers! Stories of Overseas Chinese (Part 2)

Ninth Letter from Poland · Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of this Newspaper

According to the account of their neighbor, Mrs. Krukowski (a Polish woman), whom Yin Zuoyu met afterwards, the general situation was as follows:

On the morning of August 20th, several members of the Polish "Revolutionary Army" came to No. 59 Duhu Street to search for weapons and to confiscate the goods stored in the residences of the Overseas Chinese. Yin and Xu argued with them on the basis of reason, and were taken to the command post by the Revolutionary Army. After an interrogation, they were found to have no involvement in any conspiracy and were released. Yin and Xu thought that nothing would happen from then on, and did not take it to heart. Unexpectedly, the very next morning (August 21st), several armed soldiers claiming to be members of the "Polish Revolutionary Army" came to No. 59 again and took Yin Caichi and Xu Xiangui to the garden next door at No. 57. They forced the two men to dig a pit with shovels, then shot them and left after covering them with soil.

Mrs. Krukowski is willing to be a "witness" to this murder. She is willing to testify in any setting. She said that she even tried to stop them a second before the shooting, and was beaten by the "armed" thugs. At that time, Yin Zuoyu was being held by German soldiers and forced to work in Germany. It was not until the Nazis surrendered that he returned to Warsaw. He learned about the injustice from Mrs. Krukowski in the ruins of Warsaw.

Afterwards, Yin Zuoyu exhumed the mass grave at No. 57. "It was tragic! There were two bullet wounds on Caichi's body and six on Xiangui's!"

Yin Zuoyu told me, "The most hateful thing is that the murderer is still an official in the Polish government." He heard this from Mrs. Krukowski. He said, "The embassy has approached the Polish government about punishing the murderer, but there has been no news, as if a yellow crane had flown away!"

Because I left Warsaw in a hurry, I did not interview the details of this matter in detail. Most of the story was told by Yin Zuoyu, with supplements from several other Overseas Chinese. Yin Caichi also had another name, "Yin Baolin," and Xu Xiangui was sometimes written as "Xu Xian." The Overseas Chinese in Poland all know "Baolin" and "Xiangui." They will unanimously say, "They died tragically!"

I also met a "survivor," the hero Qiu Tingjin, who came to Warsaw from Nanbu City in the recovered area of Poland (the area ceded from eastern Germany) to see me. In January 1945, Russian troops rushed into southern Germany. At that time, he and another Overseas Chinese, Chen Lixun, were living in the city of Kraberitz in southern Germany. They were arrested by Russian troops. They spoke German, stating that they were Chinese and that "Allied people should be protected." Because of language barriers, the Russian soldiers ignored them and tore up their passports. They were escorted to the city of Voroshilovsky in Russia, where they were punished with hard labor. In winter, there was ice and snow everywhere, and they were scantily clad and the food was rough, leaving them unable to satisfy their hunger. Chen Lixun froze to death in the "labor camp." Because Qiu Tingjin was strong, he endured all kinds of hardships and escaped from prison.

Qiu Tingjin now has several international friends who have "shared his hardships." He said that in Voroshilovsky, five Frenchmen froze and starved to death, as did six out of seven Czechs, and one out of several Chinese. He could not remember the numbers of Germans and Poles who died. He also said that he often thought of Chen Lixun, and every time he recalled the tragic circumstances of Chen Lixun's death, he could not eat.

The war caused many tragedies for Overseas Chinese, and also created many comedies. There was an Overseas Chinese in a small Polish city who knew some Jews because of his business dealings. Before 1939, Jews controlled the entire economic lifeline: banks, companies, department stores, real estate. All of the larger Polish enterprises were controlled by Jews. In September 1939, Hitler launched a large-scale invasion of Poland. Many Jews were caught off guard and fled in a hurry. That Overseas Chinese, because of his well-known "integrity," accepted a lot of gold, silver, and treasures deposited by Jews, with the understanding that they would be returned after the incident was settled and they would be rewarded. Poland was the place where the Nazis massacred Jews most cruelly. Many of those who "deposited" their valuables disappeared without a trace and died a violent death. It is said that the value of the unclaimed property accepted by that Overseas Chinese was considerable.

Generally speaking, the forty-seven Overseas Chinese currently in Poland are not in terrible conditions. There are many agricultural products and cheap food prices, making it relatively easy to make a living. One Overseas Chinese said very frankly, "No matter how difficult the environment is, it is easy to find some money to eat." Therefore, if the government does not arrange a special "Overseas Chinese repatriation ship" to pick them up, they are willing to stay for a few more years.

Most of the Overseas Chinese have married Polish wives and have children. As far as I know, only Ma Tingshen Guangsheng, who is best known for donating money to show patriotism, has a Chinese wife in Poland. Ma Tingshen plans to return to the motherland. He said that as long as he can make money, he will donate half of it to the country. He recognizes very few characters, but he knows very well that "without the protection of the country, individuals, careers, and children are all empty!"

After all, the motherland is still doing its best to protect them. After the embassy was "recovered," Chargé d'Affaires Bao Jinpu and the embassy staff contacted them at any time and solved their difficulties. Generally speaking, the businesses and industries they are currently engaged in are mostly quite profitable, especially the leather industry and the shoe industry.

I visited one of their shoe factories. More than twenty Polish male and female workers, in addition to very simple machines, mostly use handwork. They use canvas and leather to inlay and sew, which the Overseas Chinese old timers taught them. In addition, some Overseas Chinese in Szczecin run hotels. One hotel owner, Zhu Hanting, needs to socialize and interact with others because of running a hotel, and he has a deep "friendship" with the Szczecin Police Department, from the chief to the police officers.

After all, the Chinese are smart. Chinese footprints can be found all over the world. Wherever Chinese footprints have stepped, they will take root, bloom, and bear fruit. I have traveled to Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Every time I meet those Chinese compatriots who have gone abroad, seeing the careers they have cultivated through hard work and sweat, I feel endless shame and boundless admiration! (End)

### National Flag Fluttering, Whistle Blowing, the Hoshun Returns to the Motherland, Five Agencies Dispatch Personnel to Take Over, Carrying Back a Batch of Books, More Than 8,000 Volumes, and Delivering Four War Criminals, Including the Captain of the Izumo

[Report from this newspaper] After the Japanese repatriation ship Hoshun arrived in Shanghai at 4 PM the night before, it was moved to Guangxin Wharf yesterday morning. At 11 AM, representatives from the Shanghai Office of the Representative to Japan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Maritime Administration Bureau, and the Ministry of National Defense jointly took over the ship. The ship has a displacement of 855 tons and has been newly painted. The handover ceremony was completed at 12:15 PM, and the national flag was slowly raised to the sound of a long whistle, which was very solemn. The Hoshun set sail from Shibaura, Tokyo, on the 21st of last month to return to China. Along the way, due to excessive winds and waves, it docked several times. It was not until it reached Kagoshima that it sailed smoothly and headed straight for the motherland. The ship's radio equipment was poor, so it lost contact with Shanghai after leaving Japan, and it did not suddenly arrive in Shanghai until the day before yesterday. In addition to carrying back 33 repatriated Overseas Chinese, more than 8,000 books, and zinc plates for issuing banknotes from the Bank of Taiwan, it also escorted back four Japanese war criminals. The highest-ranking among them was Vice Admiral Kiyoshi Harada, the famous captain of the Izumo warship in the early days of the War of Resistance. The other three criminals were Takeshi Noda, Yoshio Imatoh, and Toshiaki Mukai, all of whom were majors in the Japanese Army. All the criminals lived in the bottom cabin, using military blankets to keep warm, and their lives were very simple. They were closely guarded by the military police on board along the way. They only had their hair cut and took a bath the day before yesterday when they arrived in Shanghai.

### War Criminal Fears Punishment, Expresses Gratitude to China and the United States, Denies Participating in the War

Kiyoshi Harada is 55 years old this year. He graduated from the Japanese Naval Academy and has served in the Navy for decades. His appearance and demeanor are already showing signs of aging. The reporter immediately asked a repatriated Overseas Chinese translator to conduct an interview as follows: What are your thoughts on the Chinese government and people? Answer: I have nothing but gratitude to the Chinese government; I am especially grateful and admire Chairman Chiang for repaying kindness with kindness. Speaking from my own experience, the Chinese Navy's friendly attitude when taking over Xiamen was beyond my imagination. I am especially grateful. China and Japan must cooperate in the future due to geographical and other reasons. How many years will it take for Japan to recover? Answer: If the United Nations can continue to provide assistance to Japan, then Japan will soon become a very democratic country.

Should Japan's political system be a monarchy or a democracy? Is the Emperor necessary? Answer: Japan has been defeated, so there is no need to say anything else. Japan only has one way out, which is democratization. Also, because Japan has special customs and habits, the people's thinking is centered on the Emperor, so even if democracy is implemented, the Emperor is still needed, and today's Emperor is full of democratic ideas. What is the Japanese people's impression of the United States? Answer: The Japanese people are now learning from the American way of life in every way. Japan has experienced food shortages several times, all relying on American relief, so the general public is very grateful to the United States. Please describe your experience in the war in China. Answer: I did not participate at all. I went to Shanghai in September of the 13th year of the Showa era [1938] and returned to my country in the 14th year [1939]. In the 17th year of Showa [1942], I was dispatched to Xiamen to provide logistical support. "I did not extend a hand to the war." However, my subordinates may have committed evil deeds in Xiamen, but I do not know about it. After receiving a just and upright trial in China this time, I have become increasingly remorseful. The other three criminals all said that they had passed through Shanghai, but did not stay.

After the four criminals arrived in Shanghai, they were transferred to the War Criminals Management Office. The 44 Japanese crew members who came to China with the ship will temporarily stay in the Japanese Prisoners of War Welfare Committee and wait for the ship to return to their country. The repatriated Overseas Chinese will be received by the Shanghai Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and will be dealt with according to their economic situation.

### New Police Bureau Organization: Flying Fortress Team

### Winter Relief Funds to Be Raised According to Target

Charity Horse Race May Not Be Worth the Loss

Shen Zonglian Laments the Lack of Enthusiastic People

Regarding winter relief matters, the symposium has passed four fundraising methods. The item with the greatest potential income is the charity horse race. However, according to the Jockey Club, the repair costs of the racecourse are very high, and the funds obtained from the charity race may only be enough to cover the repair costs, which will not be worth the loss. If what they say is true, it will affect the implementation of the original plan. However, according to Secretary-General Shen Zonglian of the Municipal Government yesterday, the Municipal Government is determined to do its best to handle the changes and reductions. However, what we are saddened by is that the spirit of service of the city's charitable organizations is inferior to that before the war, and the enthusiasm is also poor. Those with money are more focused on seeking excessive personal enjoyment. For winter relief, regardless of the required funds, we must strive to achieve the predetermined goals. Therefore, even if the horse race becomes a problem, the original relief plan and the required funds will not be affected. It is often heard that 60 to 70 million yuan are spent on banquets and entertainment, but they are hesitant when it comes to relief funds. It should be known that relieving refugees is not only the responsibility of the government, but also the responsibility of the citizens to work together. As for the two shelters for the cold that are planned to be set up, one was originally planned to be in Caohejing, and the other was planned to borrow the site of the former Japanese-owned China Textile Factory, which belongs to the China Textile Spinning Mill. China Textile refused to lend it on the pretext. This was originally enemy property and public property, and it seems that state-owned spinning mills should not have done this.

### Sugar Price Awaiting Negotiation, Sales Delayed by Half a Month

[Report from this newspaper] The eighth round of sugar distribution in this city was originally scheduled to begin on the 11th. However, due to Taiwan Sugar Corporation's request to increase the distribution price, coupled with Taiwan Sugar's slow transportation and small amount of goods arriving, this round of sugar distribution will be delayed by half a month. The Social Bureau is scheduled to convene a meeting this afternoon with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and sugar merchants to discuss the sugar distribution price issue.

### Compensation for Private Ships: Another Trip to the Capital to Request Advance Payment

The US$3.82 million in wartime loss compensation and repair fees for private ships approved by the Executive Yuan have not yet been issued. Zhong Shandao, the executive director of the Claims Committee, has traveled to the capital several times to request the Executive Yuan to expedite the allocation of funds to facilitate the active preparation of the Resurgence Shipping Company. Now that Director Zhong has returned to Shanghai, he has traveled to the capital several times but has not been able to get what he wanted. Qian Xinzhi, the chairman of the committee, has specifically scheduled to accompany Director Zhong to the capital again on the 5th to request the Executive Yuan to expedite the advance payment.

### Heavy Fog Near Tongsha: China Airlines Ship Aground

[Report from this newspaper] The China Airlines ship of the China Eastern Shipping Company, represented by Yonghe Shipping, was carrying 6,800 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. On the night before last, while traveling near Tongsha, the ship ran aground on the Jiudu sandbar in the Yangtze River due to heavy fog and poor visibility. Yesterday morning, an urgent telegram was sent to Shanghai. After receiving the news, the company immediately dispatched a tug and barge to unload part of the coal to make the ship float. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the Guotai ship and plans to go to rescue it this morning.

### Floating Buoy Drifts Away from Sheshan Waters

[Report from this newspaper] There was originally a floating buoy in the waters off Sheshan, at the entrance to the Yangtze River, as a marker for entering the mouth of the Yangtze River. Recently, the sea surface has been very windy and the weather has been bad. According to shipping news yesterday, the floating buoy suddenly disappeared, probably swept away by the wind and waves. However, it is very important for ships entering and leaving the port. In addition to reporting to the Customs, it has also notified the captains of all ships to pay attention when entering and leaving the mouth of the Yangtze River to avoid misdirection.

### Enemy and Puppet Houses Must Be Sold by Tender

Applications to Purchase Will No Longer Be Accepted, Except for Government Agencies and Schools

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the sale of enemy and puppet houses, the Executive Yuan previously formulated measures to expedite the process, stipulating that lane houses could be purchased by the current residents at market prices without being sold by tender, and could be sold separately. Current residents of other houses may also purchase them at appraised value after submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval. Recently, it was heard that the Executive Yuan has decided to change this regulation, changing it to that except for government agencies and schools that can purchase them directly, everyone else must participate in the bidding. Applications for purchase from current residents have not been approved, and they will all be put up for public tender. The China Trust Bureau is following the Executive Yuan's recent instructions and notifying the current residents who have applied to purchase, stating that applications from residents will no longer be accepted in the future.

It is proposed to consult the Ministry of Education to include civil and criminal law materials in textbooks for primary and secondary schools in the future.

### Preferential Military Passenger Cars: Service Is Absolutely Equal

### The Assassination of Chou Lien-huan: Five Defendants Separately Tried

Chou's Mother Demands Compensation of 400 Million

[Report from this newspaper] Kao Shih-man, the dance hall inspector Chou Lien-huan, was assassinated by a group of gangsters on June 1st of this year at 1:00 AM in front of the Atlantic Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. The police arrested fourteen individuals, including the main culprit and accomplices like Xiang Yin-quan, and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation. After indictments were filed, the initial trial was held at the District Court on August 9th. The defendants denied committing the crime. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Court No. 9 of the District Court, presided over by Judge Cao Zu, continued the trial of Xiang Yin-quan, Mao Qing-yun, Chen Yong-gui, Bao Yong-fa, and Sheng Shu-gen. First, the witness Wang Ai-xiang testified that she was the fiancée of defendant Ye Dong-ying and the goddaughter of defendant Chen Yong-gui. Ye worked as a ticket collector at the Southern Theater and was

Law-abiding

and would not participate in the assassination of Chou. Subsequently, each defendant was interrogated separately. According to Sheng Shu-gen's testimony, "The main culprit in this case, Feng Ren-yi, disliked Chou Lien-huan because Chou often went to the theater to watch plays for free, which Feng refused. Killing Chou was Feng's plan. On the evening of May 30th, I was having tea at Tongdian Garden when I met Bai Li and Feng Ren-yi, who asked me to go to the bathhouse with them. At that time, Feng said, 'We're going to mess with Chou.' After discussing it, on the evening of June 1st, seven or eight of us encountered Chou at the Atlantic Restaurant. A Jiangbei person went up and hugged Chou, then

Opened Fire

wounding him. I immediately slashed him once. I don't know Wei Xiao-yang and Ye Dong-ying." Subsequently, Xiang Yin-quan testified: "On June 1st, Little Leather Shoes (referring to another culprit's nickname) called me to the hotel. Afterwards, we went to Yipinxiang to have snacks. I went to attack Chou too and was shot by Chou, the bullet entering my back and exiting my chest. Then I slashed him once. Mao Qing-yun also slashed him once. I didn't see if Sheng Shu-gen slashed him." Mao Qing-yun's testimony about the events of that day was slightly different from Xiang's, but he said that killing Chou was Bai Li's idea because Bai's fellow apprentice Zhang Xing-bin was murdered at the beginning of this year, and Chou had ordered it. Bai Li found out and

Took Revenge for Zhang

etc. The other two defendants, Chen Yong-gui and Bao Yong-fa, both vehemently denied killing Chou. At this point, the lawyer hired by Chou's mother submitted an incidental civil suit to the court, demanding compensation for losses of 411 million yuan. The court stated that further investigation was needed and adjourned the trial. The five defendants were remanded to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison. Note that the defendants were originally detained at the District Court Detention Center, but they did not abide by the rules, and they instigated a prisoner hunger strike. Now that their detention period is over, the court, because the trial is not yet concluded, has extended it by three months and transferred them to the Shanghai Prison for detention.

### Interrogation in the Xiao Ling Suicide Case: Leng Shan Released on Bail with a Reliable Surety; Prosecutor Suspects Three Points; Confidential Letter Describes Peculiar Circumstances; Signed "An Unjust Person," Accusing Zhang Chunfan of Murder

[Report from this newspaper] Chen Shou-tao, the prosecutor handling the case of the Yue opera actress Xiao Dan-gui's suicide, held the first court hearing yesterday. The interrogation lasted from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, resulting in Zhang Chunfan being remanded in custody, Jin Zhao-yuan (Leng Shan) being released on bail, and the other witnesses being dismissed. In addition to Leng Shan, those summoned to testify yesterday included Xiao Ling's sister Qian Qiong-yun, Wu Chen and Liu Tao, directors of the Guotai Yue Opera Troupe, Shen Yi, manager of the Queen Yue Opera Troupe, Chen De-lai, executive director of the Yue Opera Association, and Yue opera actress Yuan Xue-fen. Xiao Ling's brother Qian Bo-chou and Wei Lan-fang were not present. Zhang Chunfan was brought from the Sinan Road Detention Center, wearing a coffee-colored jacket, with a haggard face. Leng Shan wore a woolen suit and glasses. Yuan Xue-fen wore a gray woolen cheongsam with a white velvet jacket and appeared ill. Zhang Chunfan's testimony was the same as his previous confession, but there was one point that the prosecutor paid close attention to: on the 8th of last month, after Zhang and Xiao Dan-gui had an argument, he sought Leng Shan's judgment and said to Leng Shan in the car: "If Xiao Dan-gui wants to commit suicide, you will have to take responsibility." Yesterday, Leng Shan and witness Wu Chen testified, confirming that these words were indeed spoken. This shows that Zhang knew that Xiao had suicidal tendencies but did not take precautions, making him highly suspicious. Furthermore, after Xiao took Lysol and committed suicide on the afternoon of the 13th, she was sent to the Sino-American Hospital by rickshaw instead of a car or ambulance, causing a delay and making rescue impossible. He cannot evade his responsibility for this either. On the afternoon of the 8th, Leng Shan, Wu Chen, Liu Tao, and others went to Xiao Ling's residence and saw torn marks on the lapel of Xiao's coat, proving that Zhang was suspected of abuse. As Leng Shan is the main person of interest in this case, he was also released on bail with a reliable surety. Yuan Xue-fen claimed to be an outsider but said that because Xiao died so tragically, she, as a sworn sister, sought justice from the court. Qian Qiong-yun still claimed that her sister and Zhang had a good relationship and that there were no disputes between them. It is said that the circumstances of this case are already clear, and the investigation will be concluded in the coming days.

The prosecutor received a confidential letter signed "An Unjust Person," which described rather bizarre events, claiming that Zhang was after her money and committed murder. The prosecutor found this too peculiar and will investigate it.

### General Feng Yan's Funeral Today

### Missing Small Airplane Recovered from Communist Area

Covered in Scars, Under Repair

The personal small airplane of Mr. Durye, the U.S. Vice Consul in Shanghai, has been found in the Communist-occupied area of Jingjiang County in northern Jiangsu Province and recovered by the National Army from the Communists. It has been transported back to Shanghai and is now parked at the Hongqiao Airport. However, the small airplane has been arbitrarily damaged by the Communists and is covered in scars. If the National Army had not recovered it from the Communists early, it would have become scrap. It is now being carefully repaired by the airport mechanics. It is reported that in late October, Mr. Durye took his personal small airplane for a weekend trip at 3:00 PM, but he never returned. There was no news that night. His family was extremely anxious, so the Sino-American Air Force jointly searched by radio, conducting aerial reconnaissance in the surrounding area, but to no avail. The next day, Sunday, Durye returned to Shanghai in the evening, dejected and injured, claiming that his airplane lost control and was forced to land in an unknown area. He was questioned by the Communists for a while and then released, but the airplane was detained. He returned to Shanghai by long-distance bus. Our Air Force continued searching and finally found the airplane in Jingjiang County, which was then recovered by the National Army.

### The Mystery of the 50,000 Yuan Note

A Conversation with Mr. Yang Xiao-qing, Manager of the Lanzhou Central Bank

[Report from this newspaper, Lanzhou, 1st dispatch] It is rumored outside that 50,000 yuan banknotes are already in circulation in Gansu and Xinjiang, but this is not the case. However, recently, there has been a shortage of funds in the Lanzhou market, and the Central Bank of Lanzhou Branch's bank drafts have reappeared in the market, which is quite inconvenient for the citizens. The reporter interviewed Mr. Yang Xiao-qing, manager of the Central Bank, to inquire about the above phenomena and whether 50,000 yuan banknotes are ready to be issued. According to Mr. Yang, as a rule, when the issuing bureau issues a new banknote, it must first notify all branches and send samples of the new banknote. The bank has not recently received any such notification. By logical deduction, the 50,000 yuan banknote is just a rumor. The reason why the rumor is so prevalent is due to the general shortage of banknotes everywhere, and

The Shortage of Banknotes

is affected by the sharp rise in prices, which has caused an imbalance between goods and currency value. In addition, because the Longhai Railway is blocked, the allocation of banknotes depends on air transport, and the quantity is inevitably limited. The shortage of banknotes in the city is also affected by Xi'an: the purchase of Shaanxi cotton is about 750,000 dan, which, calculated at a market price of 2 million yuan per dan, requires a total of 1.5 trillion yuan. Apart from credit payments and the money that immediately flows back into the market, at least 400 to 500 billion yuan in cash is needed. The sudden influx of this huge amount of cash into the countryside has led to a severe shortage of cash in the Xi'an market.

Premium Phenomenon

has also occurred, and the premium is as high as one-tenth. Therefore, bringing 100 million yuan in cash from Lanzhou to Shaanxi can earn 10 million yuan. The flight between Lanzhou and Shaanxi is only one hour, and passengers can carry 200 million yuan in one suitcase. Therefore, many commercial banks and merchants have been carrying cash to Shaanxi recently, which has led to a shortage of cash in the city. However, this behavior is not illegal, so it cannot be prohibited. However, from an international economic standpoint, it is an unhealthy phenomenon. Mr. Yang also told the reporter that the bank has sent Deputy Manager Zhang Yong-jing to Shanghai to receive and transport banknotes. Before the new banknotes arrive, the bank drafts in circulation in the market are only 400 million and are all old notes, which is just a temporary measure. On October 30th,

30 billion yuan in banknotes were airlifted to Lanzhou from Shanghai.  to 60 billion yuan will be returned, and the city's bargaining chips will not have problems. The premium phenomenon will not occur in the city. In addition, after limiting the loan visits to commercial reserves for public and private banks here, the market has gradually stabilized. However, loans for daily necessities and industrial and mining will continue as before, so there is no possibility of a resurgence of commodity prices in Gansu. (Correspondent Song Lin)

### Large-Scale Suppression Launched on the Border of Yu and Cheng Counties

### Tianjin: The Body-in-a-Box Case: Entirely Solved

(Dispatch from Tianjin, October 31st from our newspaper) Murder cases in Tianjin have been occurring one after another. Recently, a shocking body-in-a-box case happened, which this newspaper has already reported via special dispatch. Now, the full details are as follows: The middle-aged female victim, named Dong Yuzhen (35 years old, from Shandong), was the daughter of Cao Wu's former subordinate, Divisional Commander Dong Zheng-guo. The murderer is her husband, Li Sai-wu, the current manager of Tianjin Zhongtian Pawnshop (courtesy name Yunzhi, 38 years old, from Tianjin). Also implicated is Shi Meili, Li's second wife (27 years old, of mixed Chinese and German descent, who claims to be the niece of Shi En-ji). The case was swiftly solved by the police bureau after the incident.

Starting a New Romance: Constant Arguments Ensue

Li Sai-wu and Dong Yuzhen had been married for 18 years and had two sons and two daughters. The eldest daughter is now 12 years old, and the youngest is a boy, only four years old. Several years ago, Li became acquainted with Shi Meili, and on August 20th of the 34th year of the Republic, they officially married at the Methodist Episcopal Church in Beiping. Dong lived at 120 South Tianjin Road, while Li and Shi now cohabitated at 53 Dali Road in Tianjin. The relationship between Li and Dong deteriorated, and arguments frequently occurred.

Younger Sister Searches for Older Sister: Husband Places Advertisement

On October 25th, Dong Yuzhen went to Li and Shi's cohabitation residence to find Li and was declared missing. Her younger sister, Dong Yuzhi (the third granddaughter-in-law of Cao Kun), searched in many ways but could not find her. Therefore, on the 28th of this month, she personally reported the case to the Police Bureau, requesting a search. On the 29th, she urged Li Yunzhi to place a missing person advertisement in the newspaper. The original text is as follows: "Li Dong Yuzhen, 35 years old (the eldest daughter of the late Commander Huang Zheng-guo), wearing a purplish-red coat, a black silk lined robe, and beige flat-bottomed women's shoes, left 53 Dali Road in the Tenth District by rickshaw at 5 PM on October 25th and has not returned. Searched everywhere with no trace. Anyone knowing her whereabouts, please send a letter. A generous reward is prepared and will not be broken. Sincerely, Li Yunzhi. Address: 53 Dali Road, Tenth District."

Strange Wicker Basket: Entrusted to Friend for Safekeeping

At 9:00 AM on the 26th, Anna, the wife of Rui Le (a Latvian), an employee of the Tianjin United Automobile Repair Factory, suddenly received a German letter from Shi Meili, who was originally a friend. The gist of the letter was that there was a wicker basket that needed to be temporarily stored in Anna's storage room. Soon after, Li Yunzhi and Shi Meili delivered the wicker basket. When Shi Meili was leaving, she said: "The box contains a carpet. If there is a smell, it must be because of the cat's urine and feces." On the 28th, Anna received another letter from Shi Meili, saying that she was planning to take the box away and would add a wooden crate outside.

Alerting the Police for Inspection: Pry Open the Box

On the afternoon of the 29th, Li Yunzhi indeed brought a large wooden crate to Anna's place and personally put the wicker basket into the wooden crate. Shang Le thought this strange box seemed suspicious, so on the evening of the 29th, he telephoned the police bureau to send someone to inspect it. Xiao Zhichun, the head of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Police Bureau, personally went and, after arriving at Rui Le's place, pried open the box. As a result, a female corpse was discovered. The head had been cut off and burned, making the face unrecognizable. In addition, both legs had also been cut off. The entire body had been dismembered into four pieces, a truly horrific sight.

The Criminal Pair Confesses the Truth

Based on the address provided by Rui Le, the Criminal Investigation Team quickly surrounded Li and Shi's residence at night and arrested them. Li Yunzhi finally confessed that the corpse was indeed Dong Yuzhen and that he had killed her. According to Li's confession: "Dong Yuzhen came to find me on the 25th, demanding three gold bars, a car, and a diamond, which led to an argument. At the time, she suddenly hit me with an iron head used for repairing cars. Later, it became more and more severe. I snatched the iron head and struck her on the head. At that time, Shi Meili, fearing she would shout, also ran over and held her legs down. Later, we found that she was dead, so we dragged her into the bathroom and washed the blood off her head with water. I temporarily locked her in the bathroom. At 5:00 PM, we pretended to send her away and stood at the door ringing the bell, telling the servant, 'Fifth Madam has returned.'"

Sawing the Body with a Hacksaw

Burning the Head in a Stove

"That night, Shi Meili and I bought a wicker basket and other items. We used a hacksaw to dismember the body and burned the head in the stove. Then, we packed everything into the wicker basket. The next morning, I drove the car myself and sent it to Rui Le's house." Shi Meili did not admit to jointly killing her, but she admitted to participating in the disposal of the corpse.

From the time the case occurred until now, the Huang family has been keeping it a secret from Dong Yuzhen's elderly mother. The four children are still waiting for their mother to return! (Reporter: Li Shao-lin)

### Each County in Jiangsu Province Ordered to Guard Against Underground Bandit Activity

(Dispatch from Zhenjiang from our newspaper, 3rd) The Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Danyang, Yangzhou, Qingjiang Pacification Command has recently received a telegram from the Capital Garrison Headquarters stating that the area north of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, west to Zhenjiang, and east to Jiangyin is still a Communist bandit underground activity area. It includes the six counties of Wujin, Danyang, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Yangzhou, Jurong, and the Zhenjiang (Xin Lao Zhou) Office, led and responsible by bandit organization minister Chen Yun-ge (concurrently political commissar and secretary) and bandit administrative department director Zhang Zhiqiang (concurrently Chengxi county committee). Each county has a squad of armed forces with one light machine gun. There are also more than ten armed work team members (i.e., short gun squads) who use illegal armed forces to cover up underground work. Recent plans seem to have the intention of developing towards various counties: On the administrative side, strive to win over grassroots Bao-Tian chiefs on our side, coercing with threats and inducements, killing one as a warning to a hundred when necessary. On the economic side, forcibly collect public grain, robbery and kidnapping, extorting firearms and ammunition for ransom, etc. The local command has telegraphed each county to implement strict precautions as a whole.

(Another dispatch) The Jingjiang County Government sent a letter to the Zhenjiang County Government stating that over seventy Communist bandits had suddenly appeared in the county's Houhe City, carrying long and short guns and light machine guns, and inspecting residents in the vicinity, collecting all national identification cards, totaling more than one hundred. The bandits then forged the original cards, added photos, to sneak into our defense area to probe military intelligence. It is greatly feared that bandits will use these national identification cards to cross the Yangtze River to the south, so a special letter was sent to notify and ask for attention. The Zhenjiang County Government has already instructed the relevant districts and village offices along the river to take strict precautions as a whole to prevent chaos from arising.

### Wuxi Security Team: Conspiracy Offenders Arrested in Changzhou

Team Leader Refuses to Yield: Entire Family Dies a Martyr's Death

(Dispatch from Wuxi from our newspaper, 3rd) The Third Squad of the Third Company of the Security Team stationed in Nanfangquan Town, due to the recruitment of soldiers, bandits took the opportunity to sneak in, colluding with soldiers Wu Jun, Zhang Jiguo, Shen Yousong, etc., and launched a conspiracy on the evening of the 28th of last month at about 1:00 AM, taking 28 officers and soldiers of the entire team hostage, forcing them to board bandit ships and flee towards Tai Lake. The next day, except for six soldiers, including Yang Qi, who managed to escape, machine gunner Huang Shaohua was tied up by the bandits and thrown into the center of the lake. Afterwards, County Magistrate Xu sent a team to pursue the bandits on the one hand and sent a telegram to various counties in the Tai Lake border area on the other hand to cooperate in suppressing them. It was not until the afternoon of the first that County Magistrate Xu learned from a telegram from County Magistrate Weng of Wujin that four members of the seized security team had been discovered in the county's territory, and one bandit had been killed. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Xu immediately sent Cai Wentong, the deputy commander of the security team, to Changzhou on the 2nd, carrying a document, to bring back Wu Jun, Zhang Liujiu, Di Wenneng, and Zhang Fengchi, the current leader of the Ninth Squad, who had escaped. That night, County Magistrate Xu personally opened the court to interrogate them strictly. According to Zhang Fengchi and others, when the bandit army took the entire team of officers and soldiers hostage in the dark, they were all wearing plain clothes. Among the rebellious team members were Shen Yousong, Zhang Jiguo, Wu Jun, and four newly recruited soldiers (names unknown), who poured into the barracks and took all the officers and soldiers away, forcing them to the lakeside and dividing them into two boats, which were closely watched by the bandits, heading southwest on the lake. On the way, they switched boats at the Zizi port and turned towards Yixing. Near Jiaoshan, the bandits indiscriminately fired on fishing boats, and an old woman on a boat was injured by bullets. Then they encountered a taro boat and indeed obtained a lot of clothing. When the boat arrived at Xiaomei Mountain, the bandits saw that machine gunner Huang Shaohua's attitude was unyielding, so they announced, "Today is your death day." Huang Shaohua was not afraid and replied, "A true man swears to die as a martyr, it doesn't matter." A bandit ordered Huang to stand on the crew's boat, used a piece of cloth to cover his mouth, and pushed him into the lake to die a tragic death. The bandits also, because security squad leader Lu Rongguang was loyal and unyielding, did the same and threw him into the lake, and executed his wife and two sons on the spot. The boat docked at Fenshuidun Bozikou in Yixing County, intending to contact the bandit army lurking in the Wuyi border area. The bandits then held guns and escorted the kidnapped officers and soldiers, traveling through the night, crossing two mountains, and lurking in Shanggao Village on Panjiaqiao in Wujin territory, changing into plain clothes, and secretly holding a meeting at the headman's house to discuss where to go. Then they forced each soldier to burn incense and swear to the heavens with them, and become sworn brothers, expressing unity. At that time, the rebellious bandit Shen Yousong said: "After we become sworn brothers, we will be of one heart, sharing blessings and difficulties." Then a portion of the firearms and ammunition was buried separately underground, and the bandits led a portion of the soldiers and hurried away, contacting bandit forces in Wuxi, Yixing, Liyang, etc., leaving only one bandit named Cheng with one rifle to guard Zhang and the other three squad leaders. The Cheng bandit suddenly planned to go to the village to buy cigarettes, but because his clothes were tattered, he was afraid of attracting attention, so he asked soldier Zhang Liujiu to wear his pants while he tried them on. Seeing that there was an opportunity, Squad Leader Zhang suddenly seized the bandit's gun and fired two shots, killing the Cheng bandit, and then ran to Panjiaqiao Town to report to the town's self-defense force, which went to search and caught the rebellious bandit Wu Hou in the grass on Fenshuidun Mountain, and seized ten rifles, more than twenty bayonets, one machine gun, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Later, the team escorted him to the Wuzhe County Government for interrogation. After County Magistrate Xu learned of this, he rewarded Zhang for his bravery with a commendation of one hundred thousand yuan. Soldiers Zhang Liujiu and Di Wenlong were each rewarded with fifty thousand yuan and ordered to return to their duties. Then, the rebellious bandit Wu was interrogated, but he categorically denied all kinds of conspiracies and cunningly claimed that on the night of the incident, he had gone out to urinate and was kidnapped by bandits and did not participate in the rebellion. County Magistrate Xu, unable to get him to reveal the truth for the time being, ordered him to be put in fetters and detained pending investigation.

### A Strange Case in Wujin: Zhao Wenying Assassinated; Two Sons Impersonate Officials and Arrest People

(Dispatch from Wujin from our newspaper, 3rd) Zhao Wenying, a villager from Zhaojia Village in Dongnanli, Longhutang, North Township, 60 years old, who had served as village chief for more than ten years, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits on September 14th and was found strangled to death in the fields the next morning, in a very tragic state. At the time, it was generally speculated that it was a revenge act by Huanqing, the brother of the bandit Zhou Huanzhang, who had been shot.

Zhao Wenying had two sons, Yongyao and Zhuyao. Yongyao was a cadre in the Youth Corps, and Zhuyao was a soldier outside. Learning of his father's death, he returned to his hometown to handle the affairs and learned that Gu Shoulin, Tang Dasheng, and others were suspected. He successively arrested them and put them in prison along with the criminal police team. He also went to Kunshan to arrest Zhang Chifu. In the latter half of last month, Yongyao and Zhuyao went to Suzhou to arrest Zhang Chifu's son, Zhang Ruijin, and put him in prison, for interrogation by the county government's military law section. The military law section had been unable to resolve the case for a long time. Zhang Chifu's family easily requested the court to summon him for interrogation, but it was not approved. News spread from Zhang Chifu's side that this year Zhao Yongyao was running for county councilor in the village election. At that time, Zhang Chifu was a Bao representative and lost the election by only one vote, holding a deep grudge. It was speculated that he was taking the opportunity to vent his anger. Various public institutions in the locality believed that the feud between the two sides was particularly complicated, and the inside story was not easy to determine and that we can only quietly wait for the public verdict. The Second District Commissioner's Office recently received information about the case and ordered the county government to investigate the case carefully. Recently, the Suzhou City Defense Command received reports on the 30th of last month from local Bao chiefs Chen Bingkui and Huang Zhaohuai, stating: "Zhang Ruijin, a native of Wujin, has been working here this year (as a paper maker) and has not taken any irregular actions. On October 21st at 2:00 PM, three bandits, without any official documents, privately carrying firearms, posing as acting on the orders of the Suzhou City Defense Command, came here and took him away from upstairs with a short gun. After investigation, it was found that Zhao Yongyao, Zhuyao, and a traitorous bandit did it, and also conducted private torture, similar to kidnapping. He is now being sent to the Changzhou County Government. They neither interrogated him nor handed him over to the judiciary for handling. It is hoped that these bandits will be arrested." Upon receiving the report, the Suzhou City Defense Command telegraphed the Changzhou City Defense Command and sent two intelligence officers to Changzhou to request the police bureau to bring Zhang Ruijin, who was in custody, to Suzhou for interrogation. At the same time, they requested the Changzhou City Defense Command to send personnel to assist in arresting Zhao Yongyao and Zhuyao, who had abused the department's name and disrupted public security, and bring them to justice. The City Defense Command immediately approved sending soldiers on the afternoon of that day, together with the police bureau and Bao chiefs under its jurisdiction, to No. 6, Sixth Jia, Tenth Bao, Youzhen, where they arrested Zhuyao on the spot. Yongyao was out and not apprehended, and a telephone switchboard, a telephone set, a receiver, a submachine gun, a quick-release clip, ten bullets, a pistol holster, an American-style revolver, nine bullets, and 55 carbine bullets were found in the room. The personnel immediately placed the seized ammunition in the intelligence office temporarily. Zhao Zhuyao was escorted to the City Defense Command, and Yongyao will continue to be arrested and sent to Suzhou immediately. Yin Zuelie, the secretary of the Youth Library, after hearing the news, visited Li, the director of the City Defense Command, late into the night, and tried his best to vouch for the fact that Zhao Zhuyao, who had been arrested, was a good citizen and claimed that he was a member of the corps and that the firearms he possessed were deposited by the Changzhou Youth Branch. The inspector then said that the matter would have to be reported to the Suzhou City Defense Command, and as of the time of publication, the matter had not yet been resolved.

### Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Encourages Exports and Absorbs Overseas Remittances: New Adjustment of Foreign Exchange Market Prices

Conditions in Commodity and Financial Markets are Very Stable

(Dispatch from our newspaper) The Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee announced the newly adjusted foreign exchange prices yesterday morning. The US dollar is 59,500 yuan, up 4,500 yuan from the original price of 55,000 yuan; the British pound is 187,000 yuan, up 15,000 yuan from the original price of 172,000 yuan; the Indian rupee is 14,600.65 yuan, up 1,123.64 yuan from the original price of 12,877.01 yuan; the Hong Kong dollar is 11,638.80 yuan, up 933.59 yuan from the original price of 10,705.21 yuan.

In the past, the designated banks mostly had differences due to their business needs, and generally could not collect the full amount.

According to the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, the current adjustment of foreign exchange is to suit needs and is determined by reference to international forms. At the same time, in order to encourage exports and absorb overseas remittances, adjusting foreign exchange is also necessary. It has no direct impact on general commodity prices. Yesterday, the financial and commodity markets did not fluctuate due to the foreign exchange adjustment, and both showed a downward trend. The reason is that credit is becoming increasingly tight, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance continue to jointly investigate the credit instruments exchange, and the US loan is promising, so the financial situation is quite stable.

Shen Xiduan of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee met with reporters yesterday and said: Recently, US exports have become sluggish again, such as tung oil and pig bristles, whose prices differ from the previous foreign exchange market prices by 10%. It is now the export season again, so this adjustment is purely to encourage exports. As for the foreign exchange revenue and expenditure, it has been able to reach the balance stage so far.

### Tight Credit and Strong Selling Pressure: Chinese Stocks Generally Decline

### Banking Circles Issue Funds; Money Market Remains Tight

[Our Report] Yesterday the money market remained tight, with overnight interest at 1.9% per annum. Chinese stock margin loans traded at 2.4% per annum.

### Farmers Bank of China Autumn Cocoon Loans; Target Not Met

The autumn cocoon loan program sponsored by the Farmers Bank of China has ended. As of now, the total amount loaned in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is over 14.8 billion yuan. The total amount of cocoons collected in the two provinces is only 10,466 piculs, including 6,722 piculs in Jiangsu and 3,744 piculs in Zhejiang, which is far from the intended goal. If calculated at the standard conversion rate of 460 cocoons per picul, only about 60 piculs of raw silk can be obtained. According to industry estimates, although this year’s autumn cocoons were affected by the intense autumn sun, reduced moisture in mulberry leaves, active mulberry leafhoppers, and rising rice prices at the time, as well as the fact that farmers could not meet the government-stipulated cost of 1.08 million yuan per picul, some fresh cocoons were sold to manufacturers with their own capital, amounting to about 15,000 piculs. Therefore, although the government’s purchase volume may not reach the intended target, the farmers who obtained funds have benefited and this has invigorated the rural economy.

### Continued Thorough Investigation of Returned Checks; Cash Shortage in the Market

Measures to Crack Down on Bounced Checks Awaiting Approval for Implementation

Measures to crack down on returned checks have been drafted by the Auditing Office of the National Bank. They will be implemented once approved. The office continues to work with the Ministry of Finance to rigorously audit returned checks in clearing houses. After a detailed analysis of the results of spot checks conducted last Saturday, the office checked the reasons for returned checks with each bank and firm in order to submit a report to the Ministry for instructions. It is expected that the measures will be announced soon. It is also reported that the rule that same-day checks cannot be used is still being strictly enforced.

Further News: After strict management by banks and firms, the number and amount of returned checks have gradually decreased, averaging a reduction of about 20 billion yuan per day. Markets are wary of check transactions, and some stock and commodity firms are trading in cash, which has further tightened the money market. There is a shortage of cash, and premiums are occurring. It is said that a premium of over 1.4 million yuan is required for every 100 million yuan in cash.

### Weak Silk Market Conditions

Rayon prices are gradually stabilizing. Yesterday morning, Grade 1A traded at 75 million yuan, once quoted over 6 million yuan, but traded at 5.55 million yuan in the afternoon, with asking prices at 6 million yuan. Grade 3A traded at 70 million yuan. Grade 4A was being bought, with prices 3 million yuan higher than the previous day, trading at 61 million yuan.

Yesterday, the spun silk market was slightly weaker and trading was very slow. Asking prices for all grades of five-picul lots were 1 million yuan lower than the previous day. Spot prices were 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day. High-grade spot traded at 62.5 million yuan for seven-day terms, with firms calling for stable prices.

It once reached 3 million yuan outside customs, but in a climate of weakness, it fell steadily, dropping to 620,000 yuan for the next-day term, and then rising to over 700,000 yuan, but finally falling back to 400,000 yuan for Minsk spot and 550,000 yuan for the next-day term, resulting in a decline of 1.3 million yuan compared to the previous day. American goods were 150,000 yuan lower than Wen, Jin Chou Gao goods were 52,000 yuan higher. Other silk goods such as satin were extremely weak.

### Buyers Hesitant; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue to Fall

Blue Phoenix Yarn Down More Than 1.3 Million Yuan

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw increasing concerns and care shown for issuing checks by merchants, due to the authorities' thorough investigation of returned checks, which led to an unusually tight money market. There were still many sellers in the market and buyers were hesitant, causing prices to continue to plummet. Later, bargain hunters emerged, and prices rebounded slightly. However, the final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was as low as 32.3 million yuan, a drop of 1.33 million yuan from the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 700,000 to 1 million yuan.

In the cotton cloth market, although the exchange rate for US dollars increased, there was little impact on prices. Because the investigation of bounced checks had not been clarified and the money market was tight, selling pressure was frequent. As a result, the closing prices of various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-count Nilonglongtou, continued to fall by 8,000 to 24,000 yuan from the previous day. 190 high-grade Shirting remained firm because dye factories did not supply much. The eel-jumping bleached cloth industry was bullish on purchasing, but other bi-colored straight yellow cloth were all weak.

Cash Cotton Lingers

Yesterday's cash cotton market turned bearish again. Yarn factories generally had tight credit and were reluctant to stock up, leading to quiet trading and slightly lower prices. However, because market prices in the producing areas were higher than in Shanghai, cargo owners were not eager to dump goods, so prices hovered with a tendency to spin. 700 bales were transacted. Opening Han fine (cash) was priced at 3.16 million, cotton yarn swap price 3.47 million, Shashi 3.76 million, transacted 300 bales, with the spot price for opening Han fine at 3.323 million. Dongtai 270 bales, Laohokou 3.32 million, Fire Machine 2.5 million, transacted 400 bales, Zhoupu cottonseed 623,000.

### National Economic Conference to Discuss Import Quotas Tomorrow

Encourage Pulp Imports

[Our Report] The seasonal import quotas have not yet been announced by the Rotation Management Committee. It is reported that the national economic conference to be held in the capital tomorrow will discuss import quotas and may make some changes.

According to the Exporters Management Committee: After investigation, the committee found that some import quotas for various materials, such as industrial raw materials, were not properly allocated. The General Secretariat of the National Economic Conference is studying this. However, it is feared that it will still be difficult to relax the quotas in reality. The only way is to supplement the shortfall from the purchase of self-provided foreign exchange goods on a quarterly basis. Therefore, although the seasonal quotas still need to be considered, they may be announced within the week.

News, “In the fourth quarter quota, the Bai card paper category remains undiminished, and in addition to the quota, foreign exchange head positions can also be raised to import a large amount of the product, to supply paper mills to manufacture.

### Tea Export Trade Expands; Yongxing Absorbs Hundreds of Boxes

### The Rebirth of Huainan Coal Mine; Average Daily Output of 2,500 Tons

The Treasury of Central China

North of the Yangtze River, south of the Huai River, between the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, lies a vast area of wilderness, hiding a rich treasury, which is the Huainan Coal Mine, currently the largest producer in the industry. —Mr. Song Ziwen recently donated all of the Construction Silver Company's investment in the Fourth Plenary Session, one of the main departments—this rich coalfield straddles the three counties of Fengtai, Huaiyuan, and Shouxian in central Anhui, occupying an area of 17 million acres, and contains 100 million tons of black gold—coal—buried underground. If 1.8 million tons are produced annually, the actual mining life will be 40 years.

In this vast plain of central Anhui, in addition to this shining gem, there is also an 88.5-kilometer-long transportation artery, with an average of 1,500 tons of black gold being shipped to Bengbu every day, and then transferred via the Jingpu Railway to Pukou, bestowing this precious gift to the major industrial cities along the Jinghu line. This source of light and heat will continuously surge like a tide from the Huainan coalfield's increased production plan and flow into various regions.

Emerging Productivity

There are currently three mining areas in the Huainan Coal Mine. The first mining area is the Datong Coal Mine before the war, which is an old cadre with the highest output and strong strength. The second and third mining areas are the east and west coal mines, a pair of offspring of old Huainan. The total output of these three production units averages 2,500 tons per day. After decades of excavation, the coal deposits between 100 and 180 meters underground have been gradually hollowed out. Now the mine is opening new battlefields, opening three new wells from 240 to 330 meters deep as a reserve force for production.

Opening new wells is a difficult and great project in mining engineering. Starting from the ground, passing through the strata for more than a thousand feet, and digging such a large well hole with a diameter of six meters, after excavation, temporary well stones and cement are used to build it from beginning to end, and then drainage iron pipes and driving steel rails are installed. In the future, the underground "black gold" will be loaded car by car into a coal cage like a sedan chair and lifted out by an electric winch, similar to the scene of opening an elevator in Shanghai's International Hotel.

When the reporter visited the well, looking down from the entrance, I saw only a dark bottomless pit with its mouth wide open, and a sound of metal collisions was transmitted from the bottom of the well. Barrels of mud and rocks were lifted out of the bottom of the well, and the workers sat in these barrels and swallowed from the well opening. Such a huge and magical project, I don't know how much manpower and financial resources it costs!

The No. 3 well of the first mine, after a year of hard work, has been completed. Now, a reinforced concrete well building and derrick are being built on the ground, and an electric winch with 1,000 horsepower purchased from "Xing Zhong" is being installed. It is estimated that this new force can join the battle at the beginning of next year. The power to lift 3,000 tons of "black gold" per day will exceed all the old cadres. In addition, the No. 7 well and the new No. 3 well of the second mine are also being stepped up. It is expected that they will be completed one after another in the next few years. Their output is also 2,000 to 3,000 tons a day. This group of young and strong emerging reserve forces will add new vitality to the Huainan Coal Mine, and the entire Central China industrial zone will also obtain more abundant fuel.

A New Gem

A new gem has recently been discovered 25 kilometers northwest of the old mining area, at the foot of Bagong Mountain in Fengtai County. The Huainan Coal Mine Bureau and the geological exploration team of the Resources Committee spent more than half a year conducting exploration work there. Drilling hundreds of meters underground with iron pipes of various sizes, and drilling fourteen holes at different positions, it was confirmed that under the ground extending 7.5 kilometers, there are 19 coal seams, a total of 30 cubic meters thick, with 40,000 cubic tons of "black gold" reserves. If 10,000 tons are mined every day, the brilliance of this gemstone will shine for a century.

This new coalfield not only has rich reserves and good coal quality, but also has a geological structure that is very easy to mine. The inclination of the coal seam (160 degrees) is very gentle and close to the ground. After detailed research and discussion by all the engineering staff, it was decided to mine coal from the ground through inclined shafts, and prepare to use various new coal mining machines. For example, installing a coal conveyor belt in the well to replace the traction of horses and the carrying of manpower, and using a coal cutting machine to replace manual excavation. This mechanized coal mining method has long been used in the UK and the United States, with high efficiency and large output. The deaths and injuries of miners and labor can also be greatly reduced. People who have not been down a well in person can never imagine how difficult the lives of miners underground are.

The exploitation plan for the Bagong Mountain new mine has already begun to be implemented, and is divided into three phases. Each phase will open a pair of inclined shafts 220 meters long as channels for transporting coal. In the future, a large pile of "black gold" loaded with a coal conveyor belt will automatically roll out on the track bed. These new machines have already been ordered from abroad. If they can be delivered on schedule, this new treasure house will hang 2,600 tons of "black gold" every day, which can be increased to 6,000 tons in the next two years. This congenitally strong newborn will lay a far-reaching future for the Zhunnan Coal Mine and shine brightly in the wilderness of central Anhui. (Special reporter Wang Qi from Huainan)

Spring and Autumn

### Picture Gallery Bridge

—Hong Weifa

Dreaming of Yangzhou Continued 24

The childhood playground of my hometown. As I get older, I must have a lot of memories when I pass by it occasionally. Sometimes, in order to avoid feeling emotional, I will detour. For example, the Tutie Gallery Bridge in my hometown of Yangzhou, although it is the main route between the old and new cities, I am not very willing to pass there. The bridge is named after the picture gallery because it is close to the picture gallery. However, there is no picture gallery near the bridge now. Middle-aged people can still know the old site, but young people have difficulty finding any memories in their memories.

The bridge is directly opposite the current Fifth District Commissioner's Office. The current Commissioner's Office was the Bureau of Education before the war. Before the Bureau of Education was the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning. Before the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning was the library. Tang Yinchen of Hubei, Guang Sheng, wrote in "Guangling Private Ride": "Jiang Yishuang, Zi Shaodi, originally named Pengling, was a tribute student from Ganquan. When he was young, he did not restrain himself and liked to hang out with prostitutes, and he could barely protect his nose. However, he was enthusiastic about new learning and was brave in taking responsibility. When he was a magistrate, he founded the Huaying Commune, planned to establish a local higher primary school, built a public country, built a library, and built a bridge for people to pass through. Although the expenses did not necessarily come entirely from him, he was able to seek public welfare in the dark and stagnant times in order to open up, and he cannot be said to be a man of his time." Chen Maosen, Siqing, editor-in-chief of "Jiangdu County New Records" also said that he "founded the Kuangshi Society in Yangzhou in the Guangxu period and communicated with Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao remotely. When Kang and Liang's power failed, the society stopped, but the ambition to promote education did not diminish. Yangzhou Prefecture Middle School and Jianggan Primary School are managed and promoted. He took it as his responsibility to open up the people's wisdom and organized the Huaying Commune to obtain Chinese and Western books and allow people to buy and read them,输新智识於民衆, scholars have benefited deeply. He also established a private school to improve the training, the Jianggan Autonomous Branch, and built a library in the ruins of the old city, and raised funds to build a park south of the library. The achievements were remarkable, and his reputation became more prominent, so he was appointed as the director of the Ganquan Bureau of Encouragement of Learning, and he was able to fulfill his long-cherished wish to promote education." From this, it can be seen that today's library bridge is named because it was close to the Guan Library in the past, and this bridge and the library park were all created by Jiang Guangsheng. When Jiang created and renovated this bridge, library, park, etc., and served as the director of the Bureau of Visual Learning, he was highly praised by the people of the city. For example, a celebrity wrote "Ten Strange Little Tunes of Yangzhou," and the fifth song used Jiang as the object of attack. As he said: "The fifth strangeness, strange, the Guan Nose unexpectedly entered the academic world! Two years of visual learning, good at scheming, ten years of hall, even more serious, holding public welfare skills, collaborating with officials, talents are not bad." And said: "The chief supervisor of the prefectural high school, earned three thousand foreign dollars; the building is built high on the city head, and the books are set up for business." Such sarcasm almost made the person in charge feel ashamed. However, every time I pass the Tutie Gallery Bridge, the old things of my childhood are gathered in my mind, and I still admire Mr. Jiang's achievements, because when I miss the old things, he still did some public welfare things for the local area, and there are some performances that seem to be more than just an object of sarcasm.

Speaking of old childhood things, the old site of the library, until it was changed to the most recent Commissioner's Office, the most different thing I felt was that the number of people coming in and out decreased with time. Because in the library era, anyone could come in and out, in the era of the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning and the Bureau of Education, those who came in and out were limited, and in the era of the Commissioner's Office, there were even more restrictions. However, in the era of the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning and the Bureau of Education, there was still a high mound behind the house, which was the relic after the demolition of the old city wall, which is what the New Records calls "the ruins of the old city." When I was a child, I often went up to see it with my little friends, and I could get a rough idea of the layout of the houses of the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning or the Bureau of Education, as well as the activities of the staff. From the beginning, the mound was surrounded by bamboo and rattan, and it was impossible to go up again. However, every time I passed by, I could see the mound. Although I missed the old things, I was still comforted by the fact that it was better than nothing. Unexpectedly, today, the mound has been flattened again, and it has all become a building. So, when I pass by, I miss the lost mound again!

The New Records said that Mr. Jiang would "raise funds to build a park, which is south of the library," which is only a short distance away. When the park was first completed, I remember that it still had the beauty of pavilions, which could be used for sightseeing. Although it was identified as "Park Teahouse" because there were too many teahouses in it, at that time, the Inner City River could still barely travel cruise ships. Tourists could board ships from the park pier close to the library bridge and leave the city from Xishui Pass to visit the Slender West Lake. When the cruise ship was traveling on the Inner City River, passing through bridge holes, the green shade was reflected on both sides of the river, and many families along the river were leaning on the windows to watch, which often reminded people of Du Mu's poem: "The spring breeze ten miles Yangzhou Road, rolling up the pearl curtain is not as good." By the time they returned to the city at dusk, passing through the bridge holes, the moonlight shone on the water, and the water waves rippled with the shadows of trees, people, and boats, which often reminded people of Du Mu's poem: "The bright moon night of the Twenty-Four Bridges, where does the jade person teach to blow the Xiao." Although the Library Bridge still exists, the public picture pier has long been gone, and most of the park has been occupied by the Tax Bureau. The remaining very small part is said to be a teahouse, but it is dilapidated and desolate. In addition, the so-called Inner City River has also become a small ditch, and the two banks are exclusively occupied by garbage, without the green shade. Of course, Xishui Pass was temporarily blocked for defense reasons, and even if it is still open, how can the cruise ship enter again? - These are all old things that I thought of because of the Tutie Gallery Bridge. I was afraid of increasing the burden of memories in my mind, so I detoured and did not want to pass there, which was really a last resort!

### Confession

— Qing Guo

Stars – Speaking to the Children Who Love Stars

Do you want me to talk about my memories? My memories are lonely yet bright.

Children, you are all such dreamers. Your dreams grow a pair of transparent wings, and at night, they fly towards the high, clear blue sky.

And I, once used the stars to nail the glittering golden days carried on my wings, one by one, to the high blue sky.

However, the air currents in the sky gradually weakened, and the seasonal winds and rains gradually became violent. Although my wounded wings struggled to bear the hardship of life and the heavy weight of hope, I was unable to fly. I often fell from the edge of nightmares, the rapid beating of my heart counting the heavy steps of sleepless nights.

Guarding the still night, I often look up at the dense stars, the stars that nail my lonely and bright memories.

Beneath those few red and large stars lies my hometown. Ten years ago, my old grandmother pointed to them and told me many beautiful stories. And in my dreams, I transformed into characters in the stories, as happy as swimming in a boundless sea, I walked in a garden of large blue stars.

Therefore, I have a heart that loves loneliness, a soul that loves lonely nights.

A large pile of glittering golden childhood days were nailed to the blue sky one by one using stars.

Children, you children with watery eyes, don't just keep asking about my memories! When you unfurl the wings of dreams and paddle towards a sea-like expanse, writing countless stories in the blue sky, what will you then understand? Isn't it true that stars are also lonely yet bright?

And now, the night is deep, and the time for dreaming will not last much longer; the time for the stars to fall has come; we should joyfully cast off our memories. Isn't it so?

"One… I think about it

Falling in the cold night

Is not a destroyed life

But a seed of light!"

— Second: A Seed —

So, let us talk about tomorrow, let us talk about future lives.

Rain

I love the rain.

I remember when I was a child, I was very fond of my grandfather's black oilcloth umbrella, and I sometimes fondly played with my two uncles' and two aunts' red paper umbrellas. Every night, those umbrellas were neatly placed in my dreams, and I would open them up and run through the fields, through the meadows, through the streets, towards groups and groups of children, where I received many envious and respectful glances.

However, it was ultimately a dream, and disappointment tightly gripped my heart after waking up.

The adults said: Children cannot hold up an umbrella when the weather is clear, for if they do, they will not grow tall and will become dwarves. And so I was tightly bound by this fear.

I could only think of rainy days, for on rainy days, I could hold up an umbrella without reservation. But rain did not fall often, and my childhood passed in a mostly plain and ordinary way.

It was not until today that I walked on a field fully woven with rain threads.

But I am still a child, and I still cannot get an umbrella. My grandfather's black oilcloth umbrella was destroyed before he died, and my uncles' and aunts' red paper umbrellas were thrown who knows where.

Now is the rainy season, a rainy society, and I think of how my life will have to struggle in a muddy, dragged-out manner!

I do not want to dream, I know that dreams cannot mend my hopes; I do not need an umbrella, I fear that the umbrella will cut off my intimate connection with the rain.

I would rather forever be a child, dedicating my whole sincere, pure love to the rain of our humanity.

The rain is moistening the days, moistening the land;

The rain is moistening my heart.

The rain is moistening my heart. The rain is beating on my desolate, parched heart!

On rainy days, I want to walk on muddy roads. Let the rain above my head and the mud beneath my feet gather on my body and bloom into one, two, thousands of silver-bright rain flowers, golden mud flowers.

Then, with a smile, I happily whistle, knocking on each and every closed window in turn.

Drunkenness - For the Worried

Are you most afraid of thought? Thought is a winding, deep stream. Following this stream, you can often discover many roses floating on the surface of the water, which are the remnants of past joys and hopes, destroyed, and left behind. Indeed, the past is falling one or two at a time in the wind and rain of dreams and shadows.

There is no way, only to pick up one's own pain and then unfold it again. However, I will not hide from you that I have long seen sorrow following behind you, he sneers at you, staring at you with two gray-black eyes.

The good dreams you once kept in your pillow? Shattered, right? You can blame yourself for pressing your head too heavily on them. Who told you to store so many thoughts in your head?

Tell me, is your hearing still sound? Endless sorrow, carrying a kind of low and trembling sound wave, leaks into the vast space, and falls onto the soil of the soul. You hear it, right? Has there been any echo in the valley of your heart?

Good, today is your birthday, please forgive me, I have rambled on and on about some things that have made you uneasy; now, here is a cup of bitter wine, drink it, I bless you! Do not be afraid, do not hesitate, raise it, it is only a cup of bitter wine mixed with the taste of life; it has no poison, and naturally no fragrance or sweetness.

Hurry! I have urged you a second time! You have opened your mouth, why is your voice so small?

——I have done it! I am drunk! I have long been drunk!

You are drunk? What an interesting sentence this is! Like a gossamer thread, it leads into the cold and boundless night.

Then, lie down!

Yes, you are truly drunk, you have truly long been drunk.

Lie down well! Let the quiet window watch you, let the red lamplight rock you,

Let the kind autumn rain gently sing a lullaby for you.

When dawn breaks tomorrow, we will climb the mountain together to see the newborn sun.

### Recent Poems from the Art Pavilion

— Shi Shufan

Answering You, Junzuo, of Lanzhou

West of Yumenguan, the wilderness is broad, an old friend changes customs at the tip of the brush. Though dressed in plain clothes, he still opens up the world, autumn dreams often lead to entering the He Pass! New Year's greetings are delayed by letters in the shifting sands, [We] look at the Qinghai lake under the moonlight. Border crimes are already a worry, what can be done? We still rely on sincere words to move the heart.

Sanmu, Bai Jiao, and Xie Taixuan, two talented scholars, honored [me] with a visit, and we drank heartily at the Art Pavilion until late into the night.

South of the Yangtze, wild men are busy with Yan's affairs, we meet suddenly with joy and purchase a drunken spree. Old, how could we ever forget the Wei and Jin dynasties, unspeakable, we can only entrust to Yin and Yang; the moon shines above the pavilion, the path of the world is long under the lights outside the door. Soldiers hurry down, sending back the white hairs, [I] can not bear the coolness.

Children of the Motherland! Can you hear? Ah! Mount Tai is groaning, the Songhua River is sobbing, the invaders' devilish hands are strangling the throat of the Continent! Eight years of hardship and endurance, you have not shed a single tear, but I hear your souls in pain, I see your hearts burning. Songs of victory take flight, you, daughters of the Motherland! Once laughed wildly, but now have changed to sighs, more tragic than crying! Now, I can't write a beautiful poem of astonishment,

Sixteen years, this string of days without sun, (on the night of the sixteenth September 18th Incident)

### Sartre on Existentialism

— Zhao Jingshen

Existentialism was proposed a century ago by the Danish philosopher Kierkegoard. He opposed the Christian claim that we are all sinners of God. This long-legged man prepared his theory, ignoring the opposition of his contemporaries, and the sins of battle made his philosophy the central idea of Europe. His doctrine is combined with Emerson's "Self-Reliance."

However, no matter how Sartre tried to avoid people's curses, his existentialism is ultimately a philosophy of disappointment. His own dramas are also full of disappointed and violent characters, who are often anxious because of their failed struggles, constantly berating their lack of rescue. This lecture "Existentialism" was given in Paris in 1945 and has only been translated into English this year. Sartre says that his philosophy is truly the practice of "self-confidence", but the characters in his creations cannot confirm what he says. He introduces Kierkegaard's trembling before the "finite," and before the terrifying "infinite" God, this is "an anxiety that everyone can feel." Sartre says that this is the world of man, and no one can find a way for him. Swimmers are drowning in this mysterious sea, painfully reaching their arms out of the water, crying out for help, but the result is just an empty show.

Sartre believes that confronting "forces invisible to man" must be done within the "finite" subjective realm of humanity itself. Does he feel that industrial society has turned him into something without meaning? Is he groping helplessly in the dark? Sartre says: Very well, my good man, liberate yourself. This is very easy. "Man is nothing, he is made by himself. You can be free, choose, and that is creation."

Sartre is not a philosopher in a library, he has seen the life of the lowest levels of the basements of Paris. His life is in motion, not still. He believes that "truth" is not easily understood unless it is combined with "mind" or "personal experience of existence." Man is a passionate and enduring being, not a purely rational, inhuman tool. He does not develop into Christian existentialism, but prefers to remain among men, and this is where he differs from Kierkegaard.

"I think, the "truth" of the "man" can not be removed; therefore, I exist." Sartre's speech is a brave attempt to rebuild human freedom and dignity without relying on God.

The above is a commentary by Olivr Barres in the Saturday Literary Review. Barres is a student at Yale Divinity School.

For the sake of supplementation, I will introduce the explanation of existentialism in the "Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature" as a supplement. "The starting point is that "truth" is meaningless unless it is for the "heart." Existentialists say that this does not mean, as idealism does, that all "truth" is in the "heart." The "outside world" still exists. In fact, "human truth" is a centrifugal force, endlessly leading to material things. Do not lose self-confidence, become a complete individuality. According to Sartre, logically, this is a contradiction. Therefore, human existence must lead to lack, emptiness, and failure. It is because of this imperfection that we are able to be free, and our freedom itself is nothingness."

Probably Sartre wanted to "conquer nature", struggling hard, but in the end, he still could not escape the "death" barrier, and the "finite" finally succumbed to the "infinite", so in the end, he only failed.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"That's good." I nodded in agreement with his argument: "But I remember you just said that you and our army in the Nankou area exchanged messages; and that the night attack tonight will be led by you and Hucheng personally on the left flank of the front line, using machine guns to send signals. I have some doubts - do you think this can be done?"

"I can answer these two questions separately," Yaoqun narrowed those – rebuilt – peaks: "First, regarding our side's communication with the defending army at Nankou, that is a fact; later I can let Xudi report all those things to the master. Second, regarding using machine guns as signals, we already experimented last night, and also received a reply from the Ning side: the method is 'three two...three two...continuous burst...'"

"Wait, as far as I know, the Japanese army's military orders are extraordinarily strict; it can almost be said that every infantryman firing a bullet should have a basis in the orders. What I mean is, I don't know how you can run into the Japanese army's firing line? That's one point. Second, let's say you can pass through many checkpoints to the front line, assuming there are no orders from anyone, what method will you use to use the machine gun? Maybe..."

"I understand what you mean." Yaoqun answered, interrupting: "On this point, I just need to explain one thing. You probably don't know what role I'm playing in this area. If you knew that I was a veteran assistant of a spy among the enemy bandits, you would probably understand all this."

Hearing this, I seemed to realize something: "This veteran spy is probably Mai Shafu! But..."

"But what ability does he have to rush straight up and down on the front lines of the Japanese army, right?" Yaoqun explained my question for me; then smiled with a "chih"; I'll tell you, whether he's talking nonsense or not, I dare not say; but in fact, it proves that he has a special power that allows him to come and go freely in the Japanese army; not only can he do this, but he can also bring me back to the base, drilling around on the front lines of the Japanese army without any problems..."

"Then?... " I wanted to ask Yaoqun about firing the gun at will.

"Please listen!" Yaoqun did not let me interrupt; "Her style is a bit crazy... I saw with my own eyes that he took a pistol from a small Japanese headman on the front line, and just fired three shots "pa pa pa" at random; then threw the gun back to the small headman, nodded and said: "Very good!" Saying this, he just walked away. This is not surprising. The strangest thing is that the little Japanese devil, after receiving the gun she threw back, said "thank you" all over his mouth, and even bowed..."

"Hum, strange!" I really felt surprised. Because as far as I know, there has never been this rule in the Japanese army. Behaviors like Mai Shafu's, so presumptuous and reckless, seem to be something that even the senior Japanese officers cannot do. If it were outside the battle lines, there might be half a chance.

"I also feel inexplicable." Yaoqun said, with an attitude of suspicion also appearing on his face; as if he was recalling something: "However, all of this is the truth. So, it is completely believable that tonight, this guy Mai Shafu will lead us to the Japanese front line to deliver messages with machine guns..."

### Meddling in Other People's Business

— Zhu Mei

In the summer of the twenty-first year of the Republic, I was on vacation in ChateaurThiery, France. Lingdu Nenli is a city in the Malai River basin. Because the water flow is too rapid, they have constructed an artificial canal behind the city to disperse the water force. The water in this canal is very clear, and there are many fish, and they are all big fish. I usually like to fish, so I bought a fishing rod to fish. Just as I cast the fishing line into the water, a person on the opposite bank came out to interfere with me, saying that fishing was not allowed in this place. I took a closer look and saw that he was a farmer tilling the land. At that time, I was a little strange. The river is public, so why is fishing not allowed? I asked him the reason, and he said that there were laws and regulations that did not allow it. After hearing this, I immediately packed up my fishing rod and returned in disappointment. In the evening, I asked the landlord the reason why fishing was not allowed in the canal, and he said that this was a law promulgated by the city of Lingdu. At the same time, he told me that there was a fishing association for fishing here, and a bird-shooting association for shooting birds. Fishing also has designated places and certain times (fishing is not allowed before the sun rises in the morning and after the sun sets in the afternoon). Bird shooting is the same, with seasons and designated places. You cannot go shooting at will. This impression and conversation have remained unforgettable to this day, for two reasons: First, foreigners like to meddle in other people's business, which is different from the way we Chinese think. Chinese people never ask about anything that has nothing to do with them. They are purely individualistic. The highest ideal is to take care of themselves. It doesn't matter to them whether other people are good or bad. Westerners, on the other hand, applaud when you are good and oppose you when you are bad. Therefore, in our country, despite the strict laws and numerous police, people still do bad things as usual. It is not that foreigners do not do bad things, but that they do not think that everything is taken care of with the police. Instead, they immediately interfere with anything they see as unreasonable. It is like that farmer, he is neither a police officer nor a judge, but he is a good citizen. He interferes with anything he sees as unreasonable. The public morality of the Chinese people is built on two sayings: "Sweep the snow in front of your own door and don't care about the tiles on other people's roofs." For example, on a road, the neighbor's doorstep is piled with garbage and smells bad. Ordinary people will just curse a few words in their hearts and will never step forward to interfere. I think this meddling can be done, because a road is clean, but if your house has garbage, we will definitely ask you to clean it up. The biggest reason is that it is a small matter to stink your neighbor to death, but it is a big matter to keep the street clean. This is also the case with the Republic of China. It is ours, the government is ours, and we must take care of everything that affects our people, no matter how big or small. We report corrupt officials because they are our public servants. What could be more despicable and degenerate than not reporting them but instead sending them gifts? Second, our people are disorganized in everything and look down on organization. If you tell him to have an association for fishing, he will definitely scold you for being bored, because only with organization in everything can we collectively study, make progress, and have strength. We must understand that there is absolutely no nation in the world that can exist with each acting for themselves. Isn't the historical lesson of China for thousands of years enough?

Today, I am advocating meddling in other people's business, but the condition is that it is meddling in business that concerns everyone, not meddling in one person's business. (October 29, Qingdao)

### The Problem of Time

— Fang Ren

The Chinese people have always embraced the principle of "almost" when dealing with everything, and their concept of time is particularly weak. If a meeting is scheduled for 9:00 AM, it is extremely rare for it to start exactly at 9:00 AM. Even whether it can start at 10:00 or 11:00 is not certain. Therefore, people who keep their time are greatly taken advantage of.

Especially in recent years, there have been many changes in time. For example, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the rear areas used the Longliu District time, which was as much as an hour behind the local time. Therefore, the clocks of the agencies and the people were often inconsistent, and any announcements had to be annotated with the time below.

Also, starting on the first day of this month, the government issued an order to abolish daylight saving time and turn the clocks back one hour. This matter was originally very simple, but after people asked about it and wanted to add an explanation, it often became more and more confusing.

My child studies in elementary school and returned the day before yesterday and said: The teacher called us to go to school one hour earlier from tomorrow. I casually agreed, and turned the clock back one hour in the evening. The next morning, the child took a look and saw that it was only 8:00, and said that it was still early. He didn't know that the clock had been turned back, and the time was still the same. But he could no longer understand what was going on.

Looking at the advertisements for movie theaters in today's newspaper, most of them have specially added notes about restoring ordinary time; with distinctions such as "old time", "winter time", and "standard time". In fact, if these notes are examined closely, they all have grammatical errors, and they are becoming more and more confusing as they are annotated.

In fact, since the world already has the regulation of Greenwich Standard Time, international events can be annotated with this time, but for ordinary applications, local time should be used. Because the area of our country is vast, time zones are difficult to unify; even for saving daylight, we can advance the clock, but there is no need to turn the clock so often, which would only lead to inconsistencies or other malpractices due to time calculation errors.

### Emotional Storm

— Lyon

Impressions of "New Desire Flame"

After seeing "New Desire Wave," it was nearly midnight when I returned home. My heart was filled with complex passions, and my eyes overflowed with tears that were not shed because they were washed away by a poem.

I sat at my desk with my head bowed, and unintentionally exhaled a puff of smoke. That simple narrative; unfolded an impression in my mind: —

Like a clear stream, it flows slowly. Occasionally, it hits a small stone, and the stream meanders into two streams, and then they naturally converge; they converge so smoothly.

This is a desolate night song, which is sad enough; however, what fascinates me more is that human touch that shakes my soul.

If you are tired of those American films with red clothes and green makeup, I think you might as well go see this film; I guarantee that this is a work with its own style.

The story begins with the engineer Andre — this is a typical French neurotic man, who, through his brother-in-law's relationship, meets a Parisian girl, Fang Sha, who is tired of revolving in the bustling, hypocritical social circle. The encounter of these two tragic characters, coupled with the kindness and tolerance of the female wife, leads to the climax of this unfortunate story.

Charles Boyer plays the engineer, and his cultivation and understanding determine his superb acting skills, which almost make him impeccable in this film. At the same time, because he is French, his life, habits, and various internal or external conditions make his achievements in this film surpass all the American films he has made in Hollywood. The role of Fang Sha is played by French red star Mickey Marie. There is no question that she gave me a very good impression. She has always been steadily and gradually revealing the light purple glow that she should have in this drama, and she has not sought to please the audience at the expense of breaking the shallow phase of the harmonious atmosphere required to be created throughout the play.

I sincerely recommend this is a good film. I can not consider in the film itself whether I should add some heartfelt slander in addition to praise; in order to show off my judgment and vision. The only thing that makes me dissatisfied is that the Chinese translation of the name is too inappropriate. It would be better to translate it directly into "Storm" it seems to be more appropriate.

### Bernays Reveals the Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy

— Shan

Former U.S. Secretary of State, Bernays, published his famous book "Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy" in the United States on October 15th. In this book, he completely revealed the inside story of international conflicts that he witnessed firsthand. The publication of this famous book shocked the world, especially the Soviet Union. Chapter 9 of the book describes all the diplomatic secrets before and after Japan's surrender, which is extremely valuable. Here, we have specially selected and translated some parts for readers to enjoy first. The entire book has been translated and will be published and distributed by the News World Press immediately. Pre-orders can be made at the publishing department of this newspaper.

We must never forget that World War II broke out in the Pacific.

The drama that closed on the USS Missouri on September 1, 1945, opened in Manchuria in the same month of 1931. The scenes that followed were of concern to us in the United States - first Italy's invasion of Abyssinia in 1935, followed by the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Japan's invasion of China in 1937, the fall of Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938, and Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. But all these events have led us to the tragic Pearl Harbor incident on December 7, 1941.

If we regard Europe as the potential fuse of a world war, then we must regard Asia as a large mass of latent tinder. It is home to the majority of the world's population, eagerly awaiting the selection and adoption of civilization. Unfortunately, China has been embroiled in one war after another. Our enthusiastic efforts have failed, at least for the moment. Japan, on the other hand, has taken the lead in absorbing modern civilization and has made rapid progress! The Japanese people have been liberated from feudal and traditional economic systems and religious constraints, and all reforms have been initiated for the benefit of the people and society. All progress should be attributed to the wise command of General MacArthur, and our maintenance of the Japanese system to carry out the Supreme Commander's orders and policies has also been effective.

On July 17th, President Truman and Marshal Stalin met for the first time to discuss the Soviet Union's war against Japan. Marshal Stalin said that he had not yet concluded a treaty with China - this was a prerequisite for the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan. After the meeting, he would continue negotiations with Premier Song Ziwen. The sovereignty of Dalian Port was an issue to be resolved. President Truman declared that the United States was determined to keep Dalian as a commercial port. Stalin replied that this could be achieved if the Soviet Union obtained its management rights. At that time, I pointed out that, according to the Yalta Secret Agreement in which President Roosevelt participated, China should retain sovereignty over Dalian.

### The Health of Civil Servants

— Yao Yinzhong

A few days ago (October 26th), the Shen Bao published a speech by Mayor O.K. Yui of Austria in Shanghai. He said that the high administrative efficiency of foreign countries is due to three reasons: first, high salaries, sufficient to maintain life; second, regular vacations, which allow the body and mind to be adjusted and the efficiency is doubled when returning to work; third, pensions after retirement, without worries about the future. He particularly emphasized the second point, so he advocated that our country should also emulate and implement it. He also said that since he became the head of Shanghai, his physique has deteriorated greatly, and he feels like he can't bear the burden.

Considering Mayor Wu's meaning, it is actually a health issue. As the Western saying goes, "A sound mind in a sound body," health is truly the most precious treasure in life. We must have a healthy body to do any career, not to mention those who work in the government. Especially not to mention a figure like Mayor Wu, but also countless small civil servants whose positions are far below Mayor Wu, how could it be otherwise!

Civil servants are the officials of the country, and they are the people who perform public duties for the country. Among civil servants, there are also many outstanding people who spare no effort to contribute their wisdom and talent to the country. If the government cannot pay close attention to the health of these civil servants and allow them to die of illness, it is truly an unparalleled loss to the country.

### Anecdotes of the Tongzhi Emperor

— Qun Lin

Among the ten emperors of the Qing Dynasty, the Tongzhi Emperor died at the youngest age, so many rumors spread that the emperor liked to travel incognito and contracted a serious illness and died. Whether this statement is true is not credible for the time being, but the fact that the emperor often liked to travel outside in plain clothes is true. The following are some anecdotes: The Tongzhi Emperor once went out in plain clothes through the back gate of the palace. A certain Hunan scholar, residing in the guild hall opposite Xiangxiang Marquis Yu Qi, was resting in bed one day when he saw a young man enter, looked at his essays on the table, and scribbled all over them in a clumsy manner, and left in a hurry. He was strange and asked the servant, who said: This is a guest of Lord Zeng, Lord Zeng is out and has not returned, so he wandered to your place. When Zeng returned, the scholar told him the situation, and Zeng was shocked and said: This is the current emperor. The scholar was very frightened and did not dare to enter the spring examination, and packed his bags and left that day. The Tongzhi Emperor once went to Liulichang to buy jade-printed Xuan paper and paid for it with melon-seed silver. The shopkeeper saw that it was not a common currency and refused to accept it, so he ordered the shop assistant to go and get money. When he arrived at the Meridian Gate, the shop assistant did not dare to enter and returned in a panic. The next day, the emperor sent a few eunuchs to compensate him. One day, he went out and was caught in the rain on the way, and took shelter in a monastery. There was a man in it, who was very poor. When asked what he did, he was a servant of a certain noble family. He was expelled by his master, so he begged for food in the kitchen to fill his stomach. He also asked where people like him could find the best employment, and he replied that the Guangdong Customs was the best. The emperor borrowed paper and pen and wrote a note of one tael, instructing him to hand it over to the Yamen of the Commander of the Infantry, to help him find a position. At that time, a certain person was in charge of the nine gates, received the letter, and immediately gave him money to prepare his clothes and go to the Guangdong Customs to take up his post, and that person started his career there. The eunuch An Dehai was illegal. When the emperor was young, he knew of his treachery. He often cut off the heads of clay figures with a small knife. When asked why, he said he was killing Little Anzi. Later, in the eighth year of Tongzhi, An Dehai falsely claimed to be carrying out imperial orders and left Beijing to weave dragon robes. When he passed through Dezhou, he was too ostentatious. The prefect Zhao Xin reported to Ding Baozhen, the governor of Shandong. Ding Guan reported the matter to the court. Tongzhi read Ding's report and immediately issued an edict ordering An Dehai to be executed on the spot. By the time Empress Dowager Cixi heard about it, although she wanted to save him, it was too late.

### Regarding Unmarried Women

— Yang Ren

A few days ago, this publication had an article "Sent to Unmarried Women," which mainly said that the reason why women are unmarried is that, on the one hand, some men cannot afford the cost of marriage. On the other hand, some women have taken away men's jobs, so that men are unable to marry due to unemployment. Therefore, the conclusion is that women should go home and prepare to be brides. These opinions, of course, have their factual basis and are not unreasonable, but in terms of the meaning that women should eliminate dependence and seek independence, I always feel that I dare not agree. I think there is another major reason for women's lack of marriage: now our marriage system is that the old one has not died, and the new one has been born but has not yet become established; in the gap between the transition of the old and the new, many young men and women are suffering! And women's lack of marriage has become a common and serious problem in society. It is precisely because there is a gap between the old and the new that has not yet been straightened out, so those who are moving forward, standing at the forefront of the times, and those who are lagging behind and living at the bottom of the old society will not feel any suffocation or unhappiness; only those who are not forward and not backward, properly separated in the middle, are the truly suffering. In other words, only those semi-new and semi-old women who have received the education of the times but have not completely shed the concept of etiquette are the truly suffering in the gap.

Equality between men and women and open social interaction are slogans that have been heard for a long time, but in reality, where to have open social interaction is something that cannot be figured out. Especially for women, once they step into a dance hall or a general assembly hall, due to the "quality problems" of such places, criticism follows, and the ropes of etiquette bind you so that you can only stand still. Generally, parents who still have feudal air, say "listen to their freedom" about their children's marriage, but when they actually get a little freedom, they supervise them strictly and even complain. Free choice of partners is impossible, and blind marriage is not desirable, so in such an environment where the old and the new are disconnected - ten dark gaps - I don't know how many young people have been buried!

Of course, women's lack of marriage is not entirely due to this reason, but the irrationality of the marriage system - the disconnection between the old and the new, the inability to unify, makes a group of young ladies who want to be new but cannot, and are unwilling to be old, have nowhere to go, which is really the biggest addiction to wasting their youth.

### Hard to Change

— Zhongli

General Patton received a telegram from the General Headquarters during the European War, telling him to be less humorous in his reports, because those reports would become part of the historical record. The telegram ended with an instruction to him: "Bypass Trier, and use four divisions to surround the city when it is captured." But by the time the telegram arrived, Trier had already been captured. Patton telegraphed back: "The city has been captured with two divisions, do you want me to give it back to the Germans to do it again?"
