### Future Policy for Governing Taiwan: Minister Bai Proposes Six Recommendations, Chen Yi to Leave Taiwan for Nanjing to Report on His Duties

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi stated in a press conference at the Central Propaganda Department at 3:30 PM on the 7th that the administrative system of Taiwan has been decided to be changed to a regular provincial system, and personnel matters will be announced after the Chairman returns to Nanjing. Minister Bai first gave a detailed report on the causes of the Taiwan incident and the measures to be taken for its aftermath, dividing them into distant and recent causes. The distant cause was attributed to the fifty years of history under Japanese rule, which deeply influenced the education, society, and economy of the Taiwanese people. The recent causes were mainly the trade monopoly system, the bureaucratic administrative system, and Communist elements. He also explained his six recommendations. When reporters inquired whether these recommendations would be adopted by the government, Minister Bai stated that some of the recommendations were instructions from the Chairman, and some were based on actual observations, so they were generally adoptable, and a decision could be made after the Chairman returned to Nanjing. Furthermore, the number of firearms seized by rioters during the incident was as follows: 4,800 hand grenades, 3,000 rifles, and 90 pistols, but many have been returned. Regarding the inquiry about the alleged retaliation by Chen Yi against the Taiwanese people during the incident, Minister Bai stated that he had not seen any retaliation, and that government troops were responsible for protecting the people and would never retaliate. Finally, he stated that he could responsibly say that the incident was caused by a small number of Communist elements and political opportunists taking advantage of the local people's dissatisfaction with the current situation as a fuse, and that the vast majority of Taiwanese people did not agree with this. He hoped that such an incident would not happen again in the future. Taiwan is a national defense fortress and a revolutionary base for the nation. Its patriotic enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit are worthy of emulation, and he believed that it could be stabilized. There was no need to send more troops to Taiwan, and there was only one division of troops there, which had been decided to be sent before the incident. The future governance of Taiwan would not rely on force, but on politics and economics. He also stated that the forty Taiwanese people currently hiding in the Central Mountain Range were led by Xie Xuehong, a female Communist Party member.

[Our Taipei Office, 7th] Taiwan Administrative Governor Chen Yi will leave for Nanjing within days to report on his duties.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Central Memorial Week was held at the National Government House at 9:00 AM on the 7th, presided over by President Ju, with formalities observed. Minister Bai reported on his visit to Taiwan to offer condolences. Minister Bai analyzed in detail the distant and recent causes of the February 28th Incident in Taiwan. At the same time, he also explained the central government's handling of the situation and the recommendations he made to the central government after his visit. It was stated that Taiwan has now returned to normal. The recommendations he made for handling the incident were: (1) After the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office is changed to a provincial government, deputy heads should be added to each department and bureau, to be filled by Taiwanese compatriots. The number of provincial government committee members should be increased from eleven to fifteen, to recruit Taiwanese talent as much as possible. County and city governments should, in principle, be elected by Taiwanese compatriots. (2) In terms of economics, local heavy industries should be jointly operated by the central government or the central government and the Taiwan province, while light industries should be opened up as much as possible, and Taiwanese compatriots should have the priority to undertake them. (3) All arable land in Taiwan Province should be leased to farmers by the provincial government for use. (4) The Monopoly and Trade Bureaus should be abolished. (5) Before the central government has completely reorganized the currency system, the Taiwan currency should still be maintained, but the exchange rate with the legal tender should be appropriately increased. (6) A Taiwan Supervisory Envoy Office should be established to rectify officialdom and eliminate corruption.

### Full Text of Minister Bai's Report

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Minister Bai Chongxi reported on the causes of the Taiwan Incident and the measures for its aftermath at the Central Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 7th. The original text is as follows: I, Chongxi, was ordered to visit Taiwan to offer condolences. I flew from Nanjing to Taiwan on the 17th of last month and returned to Nanjing on the 2nd of this month, staying in Taiwan for half a month. I followed the central government's spirit of magnanimity and guiding principles to handle the aftermath of the incident. Regarding the causes of this incident and the follow-up measures, I have stated them in various broadcasts while in Taiwan. Newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have mostly published them. All the contents are based on actual observations and opinions expressed by officials and civilians in Taiwan, such as representatives of county and city public opinion organs in Taiwan, local dignitaries Lin Xiantang, Qiu Niantai, Huang Chaoqin, Nan Shouxin, etc., and reports from military and political leaders in Taiwan. Today, I have been ordered to attend the Memorial Week to report, and I would like to present a summary:

A. Distant Causes of the Taiwan Incident

Regarding education, the Taiwanese people have been ruled by Japan for as long as 51 years and were forced to learn Japanese. At that time, the ambition of the Japanese ruling class was not only to turn Taiwan into Japan's Taiwan, but also to turn the Taiwanese people into Japanese citizens. They did everything possible to divide them, and tried their best to slander the Chinese government, people, and army, in order to create a bad impression on the Taiwanese people. The Taiwanese people were under the high pressure of the Japanese military and police for a long time. Although most of them still understood the great righteousness, a few inevitably felt alienated from the language of the motherland, and their access to information about the situation in the motherland was blocked. As a result, they lacked a proper understanding of the government and army of the motherland.

Regarding society, in the past, Japan ruled Taiwan and gave special training to unemployed hooligans, turning them into hawks and dogs for invading the motherland, or driving the hooligans to Green Island of Taiwan and imprisoning them for life. After the restoration, these hooligans returned to their homeland, and their habits were difficult to change, becoming troublemakers. Regarding economics, Taiwan has been developed and operated by Japan for more than 50 years in the past, and its industrial and mining construction is of considerable scale. Over the years, the amount of food resources that the Japanese mainland took from Taiwan was enormous. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to military influence, industry and commerce have gradually declined, and people's livelihood has become increasingly difficult. After the restoration, more than 100,000 Taiwanese men who were conscripted by Japan during the war were sent back one after another, forming a serious unemployment situation, which was also a cause of potential unrest.

B. Recent Causes of the Taiwan Incident

Regarding economics, Taiwan's economy has always been closely linked to Japan's economy. Taiwan produces raw materials and semi-finished products, while Japan produces finished products. For example, rice and sugar are the main products of Taiwan. The reason why Taiwan's rice and sugar production is so abundant is entirely due to chemical fertilizers, which are supplied by Japan. After Japan's defeat, industry stagnated, and there was no surplus fertilizer to supply Taiwan. According to Taiwan Province, the total annual demand for chemical fertilizers is about 250,000 tons, and the factories in Taiwan Province can only produce 50,000 tons per year, with a large gap between supply and demand. After searching around the world, only a small amount was obtained, which greatly affected rice and sugar production. After the victory, Taiwan's economy can be said to be completely disconnected, and the original factories have not been completely restored, and there are many unemployed workers. Under this situation, people's dissatisfaction with the status quo is self-evident, just like the people in the mainland, after eight years of the War of Resistance, people's livelihood is exhausted, and they often have fierce criticism of the government, which is almost an unavoidable fact. The adjustment of this economic situation will take some time, and it cannot be achieved overnight.

The establishment of the Trade and Monopoly Bureaus has a huge annual income of more than 2 billion Taiwan dollars, accounting for one-half of the total budget of Taiwan Province in the 36th year. Although the government's finances have been supplemented, the scope of control of the Trade Bureau is too wide, and the scope of private industry and commerce is becoming narrower, which makes people's livelihood difficult and increases unemployment. Regarding administration, at the beginning of Taiwan's restoration, the people were excited, and they all regarded returning to the motherland and obtaining equal freedom with compatriots in other provinces as an honor. After the administrative organization of Taiwan Province was announced, they felt that the power of the Administrative Governor and the Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison was similar to that of the Japanese Governor-General. At first, they thought that it was just the beginning of the takeover, and that there would be changes later. The people of Taiwan were very enthusiastic in their support for the government, but although many administrative personnel at all levels were humble and capable, inferior ones were inevitable. In particular, too few Taiwanese were appointed as senior officials in provinces, cities, and counties. For example, among the eight directors and deputy directors of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office, there was only one Taiwanese deputy director. Among the eight counties and nine cities in the province, there were only two Taiwanese county and city mayors, which was something that the people of Taiwan were very dissatisfied with. The incitement of Communist elements: Since the victory of the War of Resistance, speech and association have been extremely free. The domestic Communists took this opportunity to slander the government and the National Army, distort the facts, and make various malicious propaganda. After the restoration of Taiwan, the administrative authorities in Taiwan Province also supported democracy in politics, and public opinion organs were established in all counties and cities, and freedom of speech was allowed. The Communist Party and a few ambitious people took the opportunity to slander the local government and provoke the antagonism between the Taiwanese people and the public education personnel serving in Taiwan from the mainland, which was the same as the domestic Communist Party, and the impact was that the source of the chaos was born.

To sum up the above reasons, all are the origins of the incident. A small number of Communist elements and ambitious people, thugs, and rogues used the cracking down on cigarette vendors by the Monopoly Bureau's anti-smuggling personnel as a fuse, incited and coerced, and a part of young students and Taiwanese compatriots followed blindly. Taking advantage of the transfer of the National Army, they expanded the riot. The ambition of these few reactionaries was by no means out of simple dissatisfaction with the status quo, but to attempt to subvert the government and seize power. Since the February 28th Incident broke out, it spread throughout Taiwan in a few days. The so-called "February 28th Incident Handling Committee" even put forward unreasonable thirty-two conditions, demanding that the National Army hand over its weapons and take over government agencies and warehouse materials. At the same time, the rioters besieged the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office, the Garrison Command Headquarters, and attacked Keelung, Kaohsiung, and other key air force bases and military supply warehouses. The illegal acts showed fully proved their attempt to overthrow the government and seize power. In addition, they beat, insulted, injured, or robbed the public education personnel and their families who were sent to Taiwan from the mainland to assist in Taiwan's construction and educate Taiwan's children. These public education personnel were not only threatened mentally and suffered material losses, but even lost their lives. This kind of xenophobic action was only slightly curbed when the reorganized 21st Division and the Military Police were transferred to Taiwan to increase defense. After the Taiwan incident, based on my personal observations in Taiwan and consulting opinions from all parties in Taiwan Province, Chongxi believes that the political and economic systems of Taiwan Province must be reformed as soon as possible, and personnel must be adjusted as soon as possible. I have now prepared recommendations and submitted them to the Chairman for review and implementation. In principle:

In terms of politics, the current Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office will be changed to a provincial government system. In order to adapt to the environment, the number of provincial government members will be slightly increased, and deputy positions will be added to each department and bureau of the provincial government.

In terms of economics, (1) According to the central government's regulations, heavy industries in Taiwan Province should be state-owned or jointly operated by the province and the central government, while light industries should be opened up as much as possible and encouraged to be privately operated, and the principle should be to allow Taiwanese people to raise funds to operate them as much as possible, and to avoid being monopolized or manipulated by a small number of capitalists inside and outside Taiwan Province. (2) 70% of the public land (including mountainous areas) in Taiwan Province occupies 70% of the province. Those who can be cultivated should be implemented in accordance with the central government's approved regulations on the lease of public land in Taiwan Province, and public land should be distributed to Taiwanese people with the ability to cultivate it, in order to enrich the people's livelihood and relieve unemployed compatriots. (3) The monopoly system: According to the current monopoly items, there are four types of cigarettes, alcohol, camphor, and matches. It is decided to reduce the scope of the monopoly, and it is planned to abolish the Monopoly Bureau and set up a Cigarette and Alcohol Public Sales Bureau. (4) It is planned to abolish the Trade Bureau immediately and change it to an organization that supplies materials, only managing the export of provincial industrial finished products and the procurement of machine raw materials, and it can also accept entrustment from private industries to handle the above-mentioned business.

In terms of personnel, too few Taiwanese people have been appointed in the past. In the future, the responsible officials of the provincial, county, and municipal governments in Taiwan Province should give priority to selecting Taiwanese talents as a principle.

In order to clarify the history of governance and eliminate corruption, it is recommended that the Control Yuan establish a Supervisory Envoy Office in Taiwan to be solely responsible for the task, so as to fully exercise supervisory powers and establish a clean and honest political style.

Finally, it must be explained that the number of casualties in this incident, according to the report of the Taiwan Garrison Headquarters, is as follows: Among military and police personnel, 14 officers and 74 soldiers died, 108 officers and 218 soldiers were injured, and 2 officers and 24 soldiers were missing, totaling 440 officers and soldiers injured, killed, and missing. Among public education personnel and rioting people in various counties and cities, 304 died and 1,556 were injured, totaling 1,860 injured and killed. The above figures are up to March 31. (End)

### Minister Bai Tells Reporters: Never Ordered Closure of Newspapers

Denies Powell's Remarks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi denied at a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Central Propaganda Department on the 7th the statement in an article by Powell published in the China Weekly Review on April 5 regarding the Taiwan incident that "Chongxi ordered the closure of newspapers after visiting Taiwan to offer condolences." He said: I did not order the closure of newspapers during my visit to Taiwan, and I have never done so in my life. Minister Bai then made a responsible statement to Chinese and foreign reporters that the occurrence of the Taiwan incident was entirely due to a small number of Communists and ambitious people in Taiwan who were dissatisfied with the status quo and used anti-smuggling as a fuse to incite and agitate. In fact, the vast majority of Taiwanese people do not agree with this. During my visit to Taiwan to offer condolences, the persons in charge of several local public opinion organs and gods expressed their regret for the unfortunate incident and hoped that I would express this to Chairman Chiang and the people of the whole country after returning to Nanjing. Minister Bai concluded by saying that the central government will strive for political, economic, and educational reforms in Taiwan in the future, because Taiwan is not only a revolutionary base, but also a military base.

### Negotiations on Dalian Issue Concluded, We Decide to Implement Military Takeover, Sino-Soviet Pulandian Talks Quite Harmonious

[Our Newspaper Beiping 7th Dispatch] According to the relevant side, negotiations on receiving Dalian through diplomatic channels have now come to an end. The Soviet side declared that the Soviet troops in Dalian have withdrawn to Lushun, but it is not yet known whether they have actually withdrawn. The government has decided to implement a military takeover. Currently, the Communist troops have entered and occupied Dalian and established a government. It is estimated that two or three armies will be needed to take over, so the takeover period cannot be determined.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 7th Dispatch] The first-line Sino-Soviet generals' meeting in Pulandian on the 6th was attended by Colonel Zhou Pu, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Commander-in-Chief Zhan Shizhi, and others from our side, and Major General Garisky and his entourage Yefidinov and others from the Soviet side. During the meeting, we submitted a note to the Soviet side, which contained six notification items. Major General Gali promised to forward it to his government for review and reply. The meeting was held at Jintai Inn, Fengrong Street, Pulandian, with the Chinese and Soviet national flags hanging high at the entrance, which was our way of expressing a solemn welcome. The talks were quite harmonious. Zhan Shizhi returned to Shenyang on the 7th to report on the progress of the talks.

[Another Dispatch] A certain military official replied to reporters that the six notifications that I handed to the Soviet commander in Pulandian were our steps to inform the Soviet Union of the takeover of Lushun and Dalian. The content is not convenient to announce.

[Our Newspaper Changchun 7th Dispatch] The Soviet military commander in charge of negotiating the takeover of Dalian invited our first-line commander Zhou Pu to have a second negotiation in Pulandian on the 6th. Concrete decisions were made regarding the liaison issues for the National Army to enter Dalian. The Soviet troops stationed at Wen Chuan Shihe Station withdrew to Lushun on March 29.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] Nikolai Peterik, counselor of the Soviet Embassy, ​​visited Bu Daoming, director of the Asia-West Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 10:30 am on the 7th. It is heard that the matter discussed was related to the Dalian issue.

### Lushun and Dalian Under the Communist Iron Heel

[Central News Agency Shenyang 7th Dispatch] Lushun and Dalian, which are about to be taken over, have become ruins due to the Communist troops' thorough destruction and planned transportation by a certain party.

No Resources Left Lushun is the sea gateway to the mainland of the nine northeastern provinces and is also the lifeline of our country's future national defense. After Japan's surrender, the Communist troops first occupied Mutus in the north and then entrenched themselves here in the south, sparing no effort in their operations. Dalian is the only large import port in the Northeast, with convenient land and water transportation. Eighty-five years ago, the Japanese pirates regarded it as an important supply base. All military supplies, food, daily necessities, and various materials from North China and Korea were stored here. After the Communist troops invaded, they looted on a large scale and transported them to Lushun. After twenty months of ruthless exploitation, rice is as expensive as pearls. People cannot even get a full meal with ten pieces of clothing. Used clothes are piled up in the streets, but few people ask about them. Even the department stores newly operated by the Communist troops are deserted. Most of the adult men in Lushun and Dalian have fled, and in the past half month, even the old, weak, and women have gone out to find food.

Attempt to Obstruct Takeover The highest administrative organ of the Communist troops in Lushun and Dalian is the "Administrative Joint Office," which includes the administrative, industrial and commercial, financial, educational, civil affairs, judicial, maritime, and health eight-work research committees. There is also a joint office of the Lushun and Dalian Public Security Postal and Telecommunications General Bureau. The director of the Administrative Work Research Committee, Wei Chi Zixiang, serves as chairman and also as the mayor of Dalian. The Communist troops' political style in Lushun and Dalian is to flatter a certain country on the one hand and to win over treacherous merchants and gentry on the other. Their flattery of a certain country is an attempt to obstruct the takeover so that they can be entrenched for a long time. Their winning over of treacherous merchants and gentry is aimed at maintaining factory production and providing a source of troops. Therefore, the Communist troops' "liquidation policy" has not been used in Lushun and Dalian.

Military Deployment The Communist troops in Lushun and Dalian have a strength of about 50,000 people. Their military deployment is focused on the production of military supplies and the recruitment of soldiers. Since the National Army entered Pulandian and Piziwo, the Communist troops have been quite panicked, but relying on the complex international background, they still disregard everything and strengthen the production of military supplies. The military supply factory is located in the former Manchukuo Railway Factory, manufacturing hand grenades and rushing to make submachine guns. The Rongmachi Iron Factory in Dalian was also forcibly occupied by them to manufacture military supplies, which can produce 3,000 hand grenades and more than 100 shells per day. In addition, 300,000 sets of summer clothes were rushed to be made and transported to Jiaodong together. Recently, knowing that the National Army is about to go to receive them, they are actively expanding their army. All party members must introduce at least two young people to join the army. Every village head must introduce one person to join the army. Those who do not reach the quota will be charged with being reactionary. At the same time, they use the food shortage to lure young people to join the army and establish a police regiment. 2,000 people are concentrated for training to carry out assassination work.

Economic Chaos The Communist troops use various means to gather wealth, resulting in extremely chaotic economic conditions and making people unable to make a living. The original Manchukuo currency, Soviet Red Army notes, Korean bank notes, Japanese bank notes, and the Communist Northeast circulating currency and Central Reserve notes circulated in the market in Lushun and Dalian. Underground transactions arose in response to the times. One yuan of Manchukuo currency was exchanged for 1.3 yuan of Red Army notes, one yuan of Korean currency was exchanged for 2 yuan of Red Army notes, and one yuan of Japanese currency was exchanged for 1.5 yuan of Red Army notes. In the end, due to the chaos of the monetary system and the unlimited issuance of the Communist troops' Northeast Banknotes and Central Reserve Notes, prices soared. In addition to using their looted materials and paper money to completely squeeze the gold from the people of Lushun and Dalian, the Communist troops also imposed exorbitant taxes and levies, issuing so-called "urban construction bonds," "credit loans," and "military loans" to collect people's wealth and implement a tax liquidation policy, pursuing unpaid taxes from the Manchukuo regime. Those who have not paid the taxes in full are all heavily levied, issuing 3 billion yuan of commercial and civilian bonds, with denominations ranging from 5,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, and forcibly selling them to farmers. At the same time, they send people to check the accounts of shops, either fining huge amounts or levying heavy taxes. Most of the shops have thus closed down. Only 36 shops operated by the Communist troops monopolize the market. Large factories such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui have been forcibly taken over by a certain army. In addition, the Communist troops also took over the World, Xinhua, Zhongxi, Tianguang, Guohua, Mingshang, Youhao, and Zhongye eight cinemas, and the Dazhong, Guanghua, and Hongqi three major stages. The Dalian puppet municipal government once took over more than 30 factories for matches, rubber, iron, pottery, printing, chemicals, iron machinery, soy sauce, clothing, canning, pharmaceuticals, rice milling, and soda water.

Destroying Education Education in Lushun and Dalian has been almost completely destroyed, which is heartbreaking to say. All schools have either stationed Communist troops or been destroyed. Tables, chairs, doors, and windows have all been used as fuel. Equipment and instruments have all been destroyed. The Communist troops still advocate teaching methods, teaching anytime, anywhere, and casually, calling it "briefcase schools." As for secondary education, they try their best to promote "communism" and Mao Zedong's "New Democracy."

Dalian currently has the Dalian Daily, Xinsheng Times, Minzhong News, and Shihua News. The first three are all Communist Party organs, and the latter is run by the Soviet Red Army Command. The only publication is the Sino-Soviet Monthly, whose content is entirely propaganda for red revolution.

### Zheng Yanfen Talks About Impressions After Returning from the Pan-Asian Conference

Delegates Cooperate in Solidarity

[Central News Agency Nanjing 7th Dispatch] Zheng Yanfen, head of our delegation to the Pan-Asian Conference, arrived in Beijing by train from Shanghai this morning. Talking about his impressions of the trip, he said that this conference was an unprecedented grand gathering of people's organizations from Asian countries in history. More than 200 delegates attended. Except for Japan, all countries had representatives participating, gathering together, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity and cooperation. Zheng continued, saying that the conference has gained a lot. In addition to passing various important reports, the most important ones are, first, to enhance mutual understanding among Asian nations, and second, to strengthen the links among Asian nations. This kind of understanding and connection is an important factor in promoting world harmony and a necessary process. First, the Chinese delegation emphasized at the conference that "this conference is a bridge from Asian unity to world harmony."

Ye Gongchao's Talk

[Our Newspaper] This reporter visited Mr. Ye Gongchao, who attended the Pan-Asian Conference as an observer, and asked about his impressions of the conference. Ye replied that the holding of the Pan-Asian Conference was not a joint effort by Asian nations to deal with European or American nations, but rather a gathering of civil representatives from Asia to study their own problems and seek further cooperation with the world. The Chinese delegation in New Delhi deeply felt the greatness of India, the abundance of talent, and the　 ( ) sincerity of emotions. India also admitted that it had its difficulties and weaknesses. The Chinese delegation's visit to India was based on a set national policy, hoping that Asian nations would progress, gradually achieve economic and cultural liberation, and enable the existence of Asia to be integrated with the prosperity of the world. Ye said that he was unaware of the rumor that he would be appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Regarding the nature of the Pan-Asian Conference, Ye believed that it was entirely economic and cultural in nature rather than political. Ye boarded a train to Beijing at 11:00 pm last night.

### Allied Headquarters in Japan Continue Efforts to Resolve Reparations Issues, Soviet Union Obtained $20 Billion When the War Ended

[Central News Agency Tokyo 7th United Press] A reporter has learned that the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Powers is now continuing to work hard to achieve a complete and early resolution of the Japanese reparations issue, and has sent figures to the Far East Commission in Washington, suggesting that Japan's vast overseas assets have been used as reparations materials. General MacArthur believes that the reparations issue needs to be resolved if Japan's industrial production is to be prevented from rapid decline. Senior officials here said that the US directive to General MacArthur to begin paying a temporary compensation of 百分之 ( )% is only a preliminary step in resolving this extremely important issue. It is said that the final solution to the Japanese reparations issue should be quite simple. If the vast overseas assets of Japan are taken into account, they have been used as reparations materials, and an agreement is quickly reached on which industrial facilities should be transported to the Allied countries requesting compensation, then this issue can be resolved. Allied officials told reporters that at the end of the war, the total number of corporate and private assets outside Japan was approximately US$40 billion, 99% of which was distributed in Northeast China, Korea, Taiwan, Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, mainland China, and various islands in the South Pacific. Allied officials were unwilling to make it public, but in fact, most of these assets were in the areas controlled by the Soviet Union at the end of the war. Therefore, it is believed that the United States will announce that the total value of Japanese assets obtained by the Soviet Union is more than US$20 billion, and the Soviet Union should recognize this as reparations already obtained. The Soviet authorities have insisted that all Japanese assets that the Soviet Union has already acquired should be regarded as "booty" and have nothing to do with reparations, which the United States has refused. Japanese officials released the following estimates of their government assets abroad in 1939: Northeast China US$8 billion, Korea US$6 billion, Taiwan US$1 billion, Sakhalin Island US$1 billion, internal regions of China US$1.1 billion, in addition to other assets. These figures do not include Japanese private assets abroad, and private assets are even larger than government assets.

### Spokesperson of the Water Conservancy Commission Refutes Xinhua News Agency's Rumors: No Flooding Occurred After the Yellow River Returned to Its Original Course

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] It is learned that Moscow newspapers recently carried a TASS dispatch from northern Shaanxi regarding the Yellow River flood, stating roughly: "According to Xinhua News Agency, although the Chinese government, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) had agreed that the breach of the Yellow River should be closed after the dikes were repaired and the residents of the riverbed were relocated, the Chinese authorities, disregarding the agreement, hastily closed the breach of the Yellow River at Huayuankou, causing the Yellow River to return to its original course and flood the area northeast of Kaifeng, resulting in the drowning of numerous people." A spokesperson for the Yongli [Yellow River Conservancy] Commission recently told reporters that this dispatch is completely contrary to the facts. It has been verified that since the commencement of the Yellow River breach closure and dike restoration project in March of the 35th year [1946], the CCP has repeatedly obstructed and sabotaged it. After an agreement was reached between the Water Conservancy Commission and CCP representatives on May 18th, efforts were intensified to expedite the work. The CCP then used the excuse that people were living in the riverbed of the old course and demanded that the central government provide relocation funds. The central government also followed the agreed-upon procedures and successively allocated 15 billion yuan, which was handed over to the CRRRA for distribution. When the project reached a considerable stage, preparing to close the gap before the Ling Fan [summer flood], the CCP suddenly requested a postponement of five months before the closure could take place, intending to delay the project until the period of the major floods, making it impossible to carry out the closure work. After several consultations, on February 7th of this year, Director Huo [Bao-shu] of the CRRRA, Chairman Xue [Tu-bi] of the Water Conservancy Commission, General Egerton, representative of UNRRA, and Dong Biwu, representative of the CCP, agreed in Shanghai that the dike restoration project in the CCP-controlled area downstream should begin immediately, and the breach closure project should proceed as usual, with the closure to take place in mid-March. Before the closure date, the Water Conservancy Commission would notify the CRRRA, which would in turn inform the CCP. Before the closure on March 15th this time, the Water Conservancy Commission notified the CRRRA and the CCP in accordance with the agreed-upon procedures. The Water Conservancy Commission rushed to close the breach during the dry season precisely to prevent flooding during the major floods, while the CCP's repeated obstruction of the closure was contrary to the purpose of preventing disasters and rescuing the people. Now the Yellow River has been guided back to its original course, the flow is smooth, and the water head passed through Lijin into the sea at 11:00 AM on March 21st, with no flooding occurring. The facts are all there, known to both China and foreign countries. The purpose of the Xinhua News Agency's fabricated rumors is to confuse international audiences.

### The Executive Yuan Allocates 140 Billion Yuan to Restore the Yellow River Flood Area; Huo Baoshu Scheduled to Fly to Henan on the 10th for Inspection

[This City News] CRRRA News: A collective construction project similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the United States is currently being planned. The CRRRA has received an order from the Executive Yuan to propose a restoration plan for the flood-affected areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, and is immediately preparing for its implementation. Since the closure of the Yellow River at Huayuankou, the threat of the Yellow River to the people of eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu has become a thing of the past. However, the 64 counties bordering the three provinces, which have suffered a major disaster for nine years, with 14 million mu [approximately 2.3 million acres] of farmland flooded, more than 500,000 deaths, and approximately 500,000 refugees, cannot be effectively restored through ordinary appeasement and resettlement. The restoration plan proposed by the CRRRA, with a scale comparable to the TVA, includes the construction of water conservancy and irrigation projects in the flood-affected area, the application of mechanized agriculture, the distribution of livestock, seeds, and agricultural implements, the construction of village houses, the restoration of highways and telephone networks, the construction of power plants, the installation of waterworks and public health projects, and the implementation of general social welfare programs, etc. The completion of the entire construction will take three years and require more than one trillion yuan of national currency. The authorities have prepared a special fund of 140 billion yuan for the first year's construction expenses, which will be implemented by the CRRRA in the 36 counties most severely affected by the floods. UNRRA has also agreed to provide agricultural, industrial, and transportation equipment worth the equivalent of 12 million US dollars. If the restoration work is completed, the Yellow River flood area will become the most prosperous agricultural area in China. The work of the CRRRA is nearing its end, and it is now preparing to use its final strength to work together with relevant ministries and commissions to implement the initial stages of the flood area restoration plan, which the government will continue to complete after the CRRRA and UNRRA are closed. Director Huo Baoshu of the CRRRA is scheduled to go to the Yellow River flood area for inspection on the 10th of this month, accompanied by representatives from the UNRRA Far East Regional Office and more than 40 senior technical personnel from UNRRA and the CRRRA, and plans to hold a technical conference in Kaifeng.

### Henan Flood Area Appeal Delegation Arrives in Nanjing

### Suzhou Mingbao Newspaper Smashed; Total Loss Exceeds 100 Million Yuan; Authorities Investigating Masterminds Behind the Incident

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 7th] Suzhou Mingbao, a long-established private newspaper in this city, was suddenly invaded by 40 to 50 people at 9:35 AM on the 7th at its editorial department in Jiusheng Lane. Two men, one in a Western suit and one in a yellow Zhongshan suit, were the leaders. They inquired about the person in charge, and after the servant replied that he had returned to his residence, one of them drew out scissors and cut the telephone line. A violent scene of beating began at this point. Some of the crowd also carried iron tools. In addition to smashing all the equipment and telegraph room machines, they also injured two staff members in the plate-making room. After ten minutes, the crowd rushed to the newspaper's business department and printing department in Mayike, overturned the No. 5 type case, and damaged all materials, molds, office furniture, account books, and documents. Fang Zhici, an advertising department employee, was beaten and seriously injured. After about ten minutes, the crowd completely dispersed, so when the military police and police bureau of the city defense department heard the alarm and dispatched patrol cars, there was no one left. Rumors after the incident suggested that some students from the National Social Education College participated in the violence. The trigger was that on the 6th, tourists Gu Nairen and others went to the "Chou Zheng Garden" in the school for sightseeing and started playing the piano in the music room. After the students tried to dissuade them without success, a conflict occurred, and they even resorted to violence in the Lion Grove Garden. After mediation by the city defense department, the matter was settled. On the 7th, Mingbao published the news, and the content was slightly different from the facts, which aroused the students' anger and resentment, and they retaliated by smashing the newspaper. The reporter visited both parties separately to inquire about the truth of this unfortunate incident. According to the person in charge of Mingbao, this unfortunate encounter was completely unexpected, and the total loss is estimated to be more than 100 million yuan. According to the authorities of the Social Education College, they knew nothing about the students' participation in the violence beforehand, and there were no obvious signs afterwards. After checking the number of students, there were no missing students. However, they acknowledged that it was possible that the news was inaccurate, which aroused the students' emotions and led to revenge. If there is solid evidence, they will certainly allow the students to be punished according to the law. The Suzhou military and political authorities held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the incident, gathering relevant agencies and the parties involved, to study the truth of the incident and the follow-up steps. They unanimously believed that other criminals were likely impersonating others to cause trouble and were the masterminds behind the incident. It was decided to first investigate the responsibility, then punish the perpetrators and provide compensation. The Mingbao authorities have expressed that they are waiting for a legal resolution and will temporarily publish a four-page newspaper starting from the 8th.

Editorial

### The Problem of Small Loans

Small loans have been announced and launched by the Winter Relief Committee of this city, with a total amount of 100 million yuan of national currency. The targets are (1) those who are from poor families and intend to engage in small businesses but cannot raise funds, and (2) those who already have legitimate small businesses but cannot turn around due to economic difficulties. The monthly interest rate is 2%, and the term is four months. According to this method, it can be seen that its nature is a low-interest loan, its purpose is to help general small businesses, and its function is active, not passive. It seems that it would not be impossible to call it a small low-interest industrial and commercial loan.

So-called small businesses originally do not have the qualifications to borrow from the financial industry. However, as prices continue to rise, the amount of working capital required has to increase accordingly. Their credit is not as good as that of companies. Under the pressure of these commercial loans, their difficulties can be imagined. Because in normal times, in addition to government agencies (before the war, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau had a Civilian Loan Office), there were also some charitable organizations that shared this responsibility. Now that both public and private economies are feeling difficult, the Social Bureau's Civilian Loan Office has not yet been restored, and there are very few private ones. These small businesses, in addition to piecing together and borrowing from pawnshops at high interest rates, have no way to obtain financing at any time.

Therefore, the Winter Relief Committee's launch of this small loan is undoubtedly a very timely and reasonable relief undertaking. As everyone knows, the industrial and commercial economy is very depressed now, and the number of unemployed people is very large. Many small industrial and commercial businesses cannot afford to support themselves and have fallen to the status of vendors or switched to being single traders. Then, the urgent need for this type of low-interest loan is of course far greater than usual. According to news from relevant parties yesterday, as soon as this matter was announced, the number of applications received by each public pawnshop had already exceeded the quota, which can be seen: (1) the urgency of general needs, and (2) the severity of the current situation of high-interest loans.

Therefore, with regard to this issue, our first feeling is that the fixed amount of 100 million yuan is really not enough and should be expanded as soon as possible. There are three ways, as follows:

1. Mobilize the power of society and try to raise funds. Fortunately, the amount is not very large. As long as the leaders of various charity groups work together and make a high call, it seems that it is not difficult to do.

2. The municipal government should appropriately allocate and supplement funds from the relief expenses to enrich it, and should not completely delegate this responsibility to the private sector.

3. The above two items may not be able to solve the urgent need in time. It seems that the Winter Relief Committee or the five-person committee in charge of this matter can negotiate an overdraft with the Municipal Bank in order to be fast.

If we do the above three paths earnestly, we believe that it does not seem difficult to increase the funds several times. What needs to be studied and paid attention to is how to lend out in terms of technology and personnel.

According to the regulations, this loan is entrusted to public pawnshops. First, the application is made, then the investigation, then the summary is sent to the committee for review and the check is issued, and then the contract is signed. Moreover, the guarantor "is responsible for fully repaying the loan and interest, and is also responsible for ensuring that the loan is used for legitimate business." It also stipulates that "small loans are limited to one time, and no further applications can be made after the expiration of the term," which means that extensions are absolutely not allowed. In terms of the articles, it has been planned quite meticulously. However, according to past experience, there are also many malpractices. There are three main types: (1) overdue and unpaid, and no trace can be found; (2) applying under a false name, lending several times in one household; (3) embezzlement by those involved, borrowing under a false name. To sum up, it is that the applicant thinks that the matter belongs to relief and tries to take advantage of it. And those involved may also have people who do not know how to restrain themselves and intend to be opportunistic. Although the situation is different, the present is different from the past, and we cannot compare them to each other, and it is not appropriate to generalize. However, since there have been such malpractices in the past, we must learn from the past lessons and be careful at the beginning. This is what we should contribute first.

Secondly, the scope of small loans is ultimately limited, and limited to legitimate businesses, which is not enough to exhaust the functions of civilian finance. As the saying goes, "Emergencies are something that people have from time to time." When people from poor families unfortunately encounter other urgent situations, they cannot be helped by this small loan, and they still have to rely on general pawnshops. The monthly interest rate of pawnshops, although it has been reduced now, is still as high as three or six cents, which is eighteen times the interest rate of small loans. Compared with each other, this is such a serious matter! Therefore, in an article reviewing the pawnshop problem a few days ago, this newspaper pointed out the necessity of reducing pawn interest and its methods. It has been reported that the industry recently held a conference and resolved the request for low-interest loans. Our views can be said to be consistent. Unfortunately, although the principle has been approved, there is no news of the method, and the date of realization is still quite far away. Therefore, we feel all the more that the spirit of the small loans run by the Winter Relief Committee, which is to know and act immediately, is commendable.

### US and Soviet Union Reach a Stalemated Situation; Foreign Ministers' Conference Makes No Progress; The Crux of the Matter Still Lies in the German Reparations Issue

[This Newspaper News] Moscow, 7th Broadcast: The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference must be completed after next week, and participants expect the deadlock to be broken, and all results will be similar to the first Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference.

[United Press, Moscow, 7th Electric] The US delegation attending the Four Powers Conference today again expressed compromise, believing that the four foreign ministers will have at least two more weeks to stay here in order to make another effort to complete the agenda. Most representatives of the US delegation expect the Foreign Ministers' Conference to end in a stalemate, similar to the first Paris Conference last year. However, in any case, there may be a slight hope of completing the Austrian peace treaty here, which is what the US delegation hopes to achieve first. US Secretary of State Marshall's "main goal before was to discuss all items on the agenda (less than half of the main issues have been discussed so far), and then briefly discuss the German reparations issue, and then adjourn or postpone the meeting until the fall before it can be reopened. Today's power conference continued to discuss the form and scope of the German interim government, and may discuss the German border and Ruhr issues tomorrow on Wednesday.

[This Newspaper News] Moscow, 7th Broadcast: The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference discussed the issue of the German interim government again. The opinions of the British, French, and Soviet Union were quite consistent, but the US expressed disagreement, and it still did not get to the point.

[French News Agency, Moscow, 6th Electric] The fourth week of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, all parties expected that it would determine the success or failure of the conference, but the result was the opposite, which was very disappointing. The Four Foreign Ministers held a secret meeting on April 1, but still achieved nothing. The focus of this secret meeting was on the suggestion made by US Secretary of State Marshall that the Soviet Union reconsider its request to extract reparations from current production. British Foreign Secretary Bevin partly agreed with the Soviet request, but the various circumstances related to this request are very complex and numerous, which makes the Foreign Ministers' Conference indefinitely associative, and it is necessary for experts to study this issue at length. France paid particular attention to the Soviet Union's proposal, because this would affect the amount of coal that France requested to obtain from Germany. Molotov, based on the Yalta Agreement, demanded 10 billion in German reparations. It is also possible that Marshal only wanted to test the Soviet Union's opinion to determine whether Foreign Minister Molotov was prepared to set the price based on this battle as the standard. If so, then Marshal is now in a dilemma, because the Soviet Union is firmly unwilling to make concessions to Marshal's proposal. In short, other various issues (including the economic organization and interim political organization of Germany) are now determined by the issue of extracting reparations from current production. The US, Britain, and France yesterday reached an agreement on the various principles for managing the Central Economic Department of the future German interim government, but before the Four Foreign Ministers reach an agreement on German economic unification, industrial standards, and compensation issues, this kind of partial agreement has no value. And what is needed now seems to be a smart negotiator, who must be able to eliminate all obstacles that prevent the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference from making progress.

### Marshall Advocates that Poland's Eastern Border Should Return to Germany; This Will Inevitably Cause Fierce Disputes

[Associated Press, Moscow, 7th Electric] Authoritative sources stated today that US Secretary of State Marshall will strongly urge the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to restore the eastern agricultural region of Germany, which has now been transferred to Poland, to German jurisdiction. The four major powers had previously agreed on a temporary agreement stipulating that the Oder River and the Neisse River should be the boundary between Germany and Poland. Marshall's proposal today will cause this agreement to be amended. It is heard that the US delegation believes that Germany is densely populated and highly industrialized, but lacks food producing areas. Therefore, in order to balance the German economy, it is necessary to implement the above-mentioned amendment method. However, this suggestion will become one of the most fiercely debated political issues at this conference of the four foreign ministers, which is inevitable. Currently, the Polish people are unwilling to lose the territory they have already obtained, while the Germans are doing their best to support the recovery of lost land. According to observers, the Soviet Union is in the most difficult situation when this dispute occurs at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, because the Communist parties of Germany and Poland are each trying to gain strength, but the goals of the two countries are incompatible. It is not easy for the Soviet Union to handle this issue, and on the western border of Germany, the conflicting goals of the German Communist Party and the International Communist Party will also make the Soviet Union embarrassed. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is also encountering problems on the western border of Germany, such as France's request for special administration in the Saar region and the Ruhr-Rhineland region. Basic issues in the western border, such as the Polish border, have both economic and political natures.

### Slight Progress in the Austrian Peace Treaty; The Four Vice Foreign Ministers Have Reached an Agreement

[This Newspaper News] Moscow, 7th Broadcast: The Four Vice Foreign Ministers have drafted a draft Austrian peace treaty and have reached an agreement that all property seized from Jews and other nationals during the German occupation period should be restored immediately. If it cannot be restored, appropriate compensation can be given.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 7th Electric] The representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers drafted the Austrian peace treaty and agreed today that Austria must return to the original owners the property of Jews and other people confiscated for racial or political reasons during the Nazi rule. If the original property cannot be returned, compensation should be given. It is rumored that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is prepared to re-criticize the US and British compensation policies toward Germany when the United Nations Compensation Committee submits a report to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Official sources expect the compensation report to be delivered to the Four Foreign Ministers today.

### Western Political Situation: Calls for Restoration Gradually Rise

[Reuters, London, 7th] The "Times" Madrid correspondent claims that Franco's regime has recently shown phenomena similar to those on the eve of the collapse of the former Republican dictator Rivera. However, due to the complexity of the situation, there is no hope for an early resolution. Franco, in a recent interview with reporters, mentioned the opposition of moderates, which is tantamount to admitting that his opponents are not limited to communists, exiles, and those hiding in the mountains. The fifth column in Madrid and Barcelona poses a greater danger to Franco than his enemies in Paris, Lisbon, and Toulon. The influence of the monarchists now occupies the top position among the various opposition factions. Every party, including the Communist Party, has people who support the restoration, the only difference being that they lack a detailed agreement with Don Juan on key matters. Attempts to weave a post-Franco united front based on restoration have achieved partial success, but constitutional guarantees of political freedom and the right to vote remain the main obstacles to a final agreement. The lack of agreement within the opposition prevents Franco's position from being shaken for the time being, especially since Franco still has the army loyal to him. Therefore, it is currently impossible to overthrow Franco.

### Observer of "Truman Doctrine" Comments on Truman's Recent Speech

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Foreign policy observers unanimously believe today that President Truman's speech on Jefferson Memorial Day has resolutely revealed a global Monroe Doctrine. If the U.S. Congress supports Truman's position, this speech will leave a profound impact in the coming years. Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey has been criticized as the first step in a global policy to resist communism. Truman not only avoids suspicion this time, but also frankly admits that this is indeed the case, and cites history as a defense of his position. Although Truman repeatedly expressed his determination to support free governments against external threats in his speech, the last few words at the end of the speech provide a very simple and clear explanation of his foreign policy. He said: "The American people cannot ignore the people in other parts of the world fighting for human rights, thinking that it has nothing to do with them." Some observers believe that Truman's remarks can be called the "Truman Doctrine."

### Moscow Radio Broadcast: Soviet Union's War Expenses Against Germany and Japan

[United Press, London, 7th] Moscow Radio today quoted the "New Times" magazine as saying that the Soviet Union's war expenses in the war against Germany and Japan amounted to $357 billion, and the direct losses from German damage and looting within the Soviet territory amounted to $128 million.

### De Gaulle Delivers a Speech: Calls on France for National Unity and Cooperation with the United States to Maintain World Peace

[Agence France-Presse, Strasbourg, France, 7th] General de Gaulle delivered his second speech today at the commemoration ceremony of the liberation of Strasbourg, stating that the United States and the Soviet Union are bound to create a confrontational situation. Therefore, in this situation, France needs to be unified and united to become the mainstay of Europe and contribute to world peace.

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 7th Broadcast: De Gaulle delivered a speech today, the main points are as follows: (1) To cope with the current crisis, France must revise its constitution; (2) France should continue to maintain its Westernization. In the continuing confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, France must maintain a balancing factor; (3) Germany must be completely disarmed so that it cannot engage in aggression again.

[Reuters, Strasbourg, 6th] Today is the third anniversary of the liberation of Strasbourg. A commemorative ceremony was held here. General de Gaulle addressed tens of thousands of people, saying that if a new tyrannical politics threatens a part or all of the world, the United States and France will be able to join hands to resist it together. The General highly praised the United States' contribution to the war. He also pointed out that the similar concepts between the American and French peoples create an extraordinary moral connection between the two, and no change can destroy this connection. He also said that whenever the world's justice is wounded, the concerns of the United States and France will occur at the same time. The two major democratic countries, the United States and France, can issue the same powerful response when defending freedom in danger. The world today has an unclear horizon ahead and a difficult road ahead. To solve the problems facing mankind today, especially the problem of peace, all countries in the world, especially the four major powers, have a major task. De Gaulle also sent a telegram to General Eisenhower today, stating, "On the occasion of the unveiling of the American military monument in Alsace, I would like to pay tribute to the general. We will always remember the general, and we will always remember the brave American army of yesterday, today, and tomorrow." Communist members of the Strasbourg City Council refused to participate in today's ceremony.

[Reuters, London, Strasbourg, 6th] General de Gaulle delivered a speech here, frankly abandoning the delicate balance that French politicians have tried to maintain in the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. He declared that the United States and France must agree to resist any new tyranny. Tens of thousands of French people listening in the audience unanimously recognized that what General Dai pointed to must be the Soviet Union.

### U.S. Telephone Workers Strike: 340,000 Participate, All U.S. Telephones Are Obstructed

The strike began at 6:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time). Three hours later, telephone workers on the West Coast also stopped working, and the labor unrest spread throughout the country.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The president of the National Federation of Telephone Workers, Heaton, declared at 5:55 a.m. (U.S. Eastern Standard Time) that telephone workers across the country had gone on strike. Labor Secretary Schweilenbach appealed at the last minute to postpone the strike for 48 hours. The members of the Union Policy Committee got out of bed to listen to Schweilenbach's appeal, but ignored it. A few minutes later, telephone workers began to stop working.

### United States Celebrates Army Day: Chief of Staff and Secretary of the Army Deliver Speeches: Strongly Argue the Necessity of the United States Having a Strong Army

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Today is the 13th anniversary of the United States' participation in World War I, which is also U.S. Army Day. Secretary of the Army Patterson delivered a radio speech, strongly arguing the necessity of the United States having a strong army. We must not forget that in this imperfect world, military power can still determine the fate of countries. The West Point Military Academy is well-managed and has achieved remarkable results, which is commendable. In addition, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower also delivered a radio speech, saying: The U.S. military's task of achieving security and peace can only be completed with the support of the American people. Unless we can restore the spirit of the past and believe that we can gain the support of the American people, the U.S. Army will not be able to complete its mission.

### Enthusiastic Situation Throughout the Country

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 6th] April 6th to 12th is U.S. Army Week, which will be commemorated with the meaning of "A Strong America is a Peaceful America." During this week, many organizations, newspapers, radio programs, and individuals in the United States will participate in celebrations and various activities to pay tribute to the army and the soldiers who sacrificed for the country. Army Day itself will be commemorated tomorrow (the 7th). Army Day and Easter will be combined to hold solemn religious ceremonies, and special peace prayers will be held by army chaplains in churches across the country.

[United Press, Moscow, 7th] The U.S. delegation held a cocktail party last night to commemorate U.S. Army Day today. More than a dozen Soviet generals were invited to participate. Soviet Supreme Commander Kodochav also attended the scene. This was the first time he met U.S. Secretary of State Marshal, but the topic of their conversation was limited to the climate in Moscow.

### U.S. Jet Formation Shines over Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] This morning, eight lightning-fast P-80 jet-propelled aircraft flew low over the review point during the Army Day parade. It was the first time that the world's fastest ejection-seat aircraft formation flew over Tokyo. The audience was amazed by its astonishing speed.

### British Minister of Defense Speech: Insists on One-Year Conscription Law

[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] British Minister of Defense Alexander delivered a speech in Llandudno, Wales, today, saying: The government will insist on the one-year conscription bill despite criticism from former Prime Minister Churchill. If Parliament passes the Conservative Party's amendment, the cabinet will resign. Former Prime Minister Churchill once issued a statement saying: The reason why the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party voted in favor of the government was that they heard the ministers issue public statements and firmly believed that the government's plan submitted to Parliament was the result of thorough research and was based on the advice of military experts. In fact, the government had obtained the consent of the Chief of Staff before deciding to reduce the military training period from 18 months to one year. I still intend to maintain this decision. If you impose the burden of national defense on us, and we take unnecessary risks and cause misfortune to the country in the future, there will be many people who want to criticize us completely. We offer a promise to continue working to the best of our ability so that international institutions can succeed in achieving their goals of true collective security on a solid foundation of peace. As for the Conservative Party's amendment, I would like to ask Labor Party members not to pass this amendment, because in fact it is a vote of censure against the Labor Party cabinet. If this bill is passed, the Labor Party cabinet will have to resign. By January 1949, 700,000 soldiers will be discharged from the army. Only by recruiting new recruits or volunteers can they be replenished. This means that unless we can take appropriate steps, the army's position will be threatened in terms of effectiveness and management.

### Indian Viceroy Meets Jinnah Again

### Japanese Local Governor Elections: Conservatives Win Big: Voters Abandon Voting by Half

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] Preliminary reports of the Japanese local governor elections prove that the Conservative Party has taken the upper hand. Of the 38 prefectural governors nationwide, 24 who have been elected are independents, most of whom are conservatives. The Conservative Democratic Party won four prefectures, the Liberal Party won two prefectures, and the Social Democratic Party won four prefectures. Seventeen of them are re-elected. At the same time, 209 mayors nationwide have also been elected, of which the Socialist Party won eight cities, including Osaka and Yokohama.

The mayors of Nagoya and Kyoto were both elected as independents.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese local governor elections were held nationwide yesterday. According to partial reports, as many as 50% of voters in major cities abstained from voting.

In addition, some spoiled ballots were found in the votes that had already been cast, with "Rice" or "Give us rice" written on them.

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 7th] The U.S. Trusteeship Agreement for the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific originally had 16 articles, three of which were revised by the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday when approving the agreement. The rest remained unchanged. The agreement must now be approved by the U.S. Congress before trusteeship can be implemented. The revised clauses are as follows: Article 3: "The Administering Authority shall have full powers of administration, legislation, and jurisdiction over the territory in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and may, under any modifications that the Administering Authority deems appropriate, apply American laws deemed suitable to local conditions and needs to the Trust Territory." Article 6: "In fulfilling its obligations under Article 76(b) of the Charter, the Administering Authority shall (1) foster the development of political institutions suitable to the Trust Territory and shall promote the development of the inhabitants of the Trust Territory in order to achieve self-government and independence in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the Trust Territory, its inhabitants, and its people; and to this end, shall provide the inhabitants of the Trust Territory with opportunities for administrative services on the territory and encourage their participation in the government, giving due recognition to the customs of the inhabitants when enacting laws, and taking other measures to achieve this purpose." (Sections (2), (3) and (4) of Article 6 remain unchanged from the original text).

### Debates on the Mei Subo Case Conclude: Verdict Scheduled for the 14th of This Month: Prosecutor Expresses Doubt About Two Witnesses, Mrs. Bao and Others: Defendant's Lawyer Says Economic Program Not Yet Effective

[Our Newspaper] The "Foreign Tiger" case was heard for the third time in the District Court yesterday, the debates concluded, and the verdict is scheduled for April 14.

The defendant Mei Subo's testimony was not significantly different from the previous two hearings. Judge Meng Ting paid special attention to the gold and U.S. dollar part and questioned witness Mrs. Bao: You entrusted such a large amount of property, 21,201 U.S. dollars and 38 gold bars, to others with only a non-bearer code list and no other proof documents. Why do you trust them so much? Mrs. Bao replied: The gold and U.S. dollars were entrusted by Tianjin Linxing Company to Shanghai Xinfeng Company for purchase. Because Wang Dongchen, the manager of Linxing Company, was a known acquaintance, she entrusted him to transfer the goods without any suspicion. The court then asked why the code list held by Bao Tai Tai had the words "Lianfeng" instead of "Xinfeng"? Mrs. Bao could not answer. Judge Meng Ting then questioned witness Chen Xiexin, who replied: The gold and dollars were entrusted to him by Xinfeng after Tianjin's entrustment. He also had a registered name, "Lianfeng," so the code list given to Mrs. Bao was written on "Lianfeng" paper. He also said: Because he had no insurance equipment, he deposited it with Ebers Company. At this point,

the debate begins

Prosecutor Tao stood up and said: (1) Our country's foreign exchange is uniformly managed by the Central Bank. Without permission, no bank or money shop is allowed to operate, and Ebers Company, hosted by the defendant, arbitrarily buys and sells foreign exchange to supply illegal smuggling merchants. (2) Although Mrs. Bao came to claim the gold and U.S. dollars, she failed to provide strong evidence. How can such a large amount of property be deposited with others without a formal receipt or other deposit documents? The identity of broker Chen Xiexin is also

unclear

The letter that Mrs. Bao presented from Tianjin mentioned: "An unfortunate event in this bank". What does "this bank" exactly refer to? After this comes the defendant's lawyer Chen Tingrui to make a five-point defense: (1) There are many contradictions between the economic emergency measures program and the legal laws, and the judicial organs should not prosecute and judge based on this without legislative procedures. (2) Assuming that Article 7 of this method is indeed a law, but it was not implemented in Shanghai when this case occurred (March 3), because the Regulations on the Effective Date of Laws stipulate that Jiangsu Province (Shanghai is the same as Jiangsu Province) has a limit of 15 days after the government announces its effectiveness, the economic emergency measures program was announced on February 17 (Article 120 of the Civil Law stipulates that if the period is determined by the date, the starting day is not counted), so the plan in Shanghai could not

take effect

until 0:00 on March 5. (3) Ebers Company is a foreign exchange brokerage company. It is unfair to call the company in the indictment a "bank-natured organization." (4) Article 7 of the program is specifically to prohibit the circulation of foreign currency notes, and does not prohibit the circulation of foreign exchange. The telegraphic transfers and remittances that Ebers Company operates are not prohibited. (5) The currency notes confiscated in Article 7 of the program refer to specific currency notes that are currently in circulation. The foreign currency found in Ebers Company's raid was in a static state and cannot be confiscated. Therefore, please declare the defendant innocent, suspend detention, and return all confiscated property.

### Recovering British Tramway Requires US$4 Million

[Our Newspaper] The exclusive contract signed by the British Tramway Company of this city with the former Municipal Council on October 10, 1905, stipulates that the valid period is 35 years (expiring on October 10, 1940). After the expiration, if the Municipal Council wants to evaluate and recover the property, it should notify the company of the intention to terminate the agreement six months before the expiration, otherwise it will be automatically extended for seven years. Later, because the former Municipal Council did not notify the termination before the expiration in 1940, the extension was for seven years until now. Now the expiration is approaching in an instant. According to regulations, the decision should be notified to the company on April 10 this year. The city government has previously submitted this issue to the city council for a public decision, but the result was only a decision to recover the property in principle, and there were no specific methods. Now that the declaration date is approaching, Mayor Wu held a tea party in the city government auditorium yesterday afternoon, inviting members of the city council's public utilities committee and relevant parties to listen to their opinions for a decision.

Yesterday's discussion still had no definite outcome, but the majority opinion was to continue the extension for seven years. According to Mayor Wu's explanation of the actual problems: According to the investigation, the value of the tramway company's assets is more than US$4 million. It is currently impossible to apply for such a large amount of foreign exchange. If the property is repurchased by converting it into national currency, it is still questionable whether the company will agree. Even if it is purchased with national currency, it will require 50 billion yuan, and it will not be easy to raise the funds. Therefore, he specifically sought the opinions of the city council. Many people expressed their opinions, and most believed that under the principle that the company's business operations do not harm our country's sovereignty, it may be possible to extend it for another seven years, and then find ways to recover it after the expiration. However, it is hoped that the city government should have a unified method for managing the city's tramways. Now that the concessions have been abolished, there is no need for separate methods in the British and French sectors. At the same time, close attention should be paid to the current management shortcomings and ways should be found to improve them. Mayor Wu expressed his high regard for the opinions of those present and will use them as a reference for making a final decision.

### Chairman's Concern: Police Officer Treatment

Commander Xuan Announces Adjustments Will Be Made

Yesterday, Commander Xuan Tiewu told reporters: Since the establishment of the Garrison Headquarters' Inspection Team, the military, police, and constabulary have been unified under command, achieving remarkable results in maintaining public order. However, the responsibility of maintaining public order is significant, and the treatment of personnel in the Inspection Brigade has been considered for improvement. As for the treatment of police officers, he has repeatedly requested adjustments, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has also expressed great concern about this. When he came to Shanghai last year, and when Commander Xuan went to Nanjing to report on his duties, and recently when the Chairman returned to Fenghua to sweep his ancestors' graves and passed through Shanghai, he inquired about this matter with Commander Xuan. However, due to the city government's financial constraints, this has not yet materialized. Commander Xuan said: "However, this is only a matter of time."

Regarding the housing dispute, it is a legal issue of tenancy, which is not within the city government's authority. Representatives then presented the past leasing process and requested the Mayor to consider the serious housing shortage and write to the landlord for a meeting to find a reasonable solution.

### Tuberculosis Bacteria Devastates Youth: 160,000 Patients in This City. Lack of Anti-Tuberculosis Equipment is Profoundly Felt. Anti-Tuberculosis Association Holds Fundraising Committee Meeting with a Goal of 1.5 Billion in Two Months

[Report from Our Newspaper] The spread of tuberculosis in our country is severe. According to statistics, the mortality rate is 400 per 100,000 people. If the country is calculated with a population of 450 million, the number of deaths each year is 1.8 million, the number of deaths per day is 4,9300, and the number of deaths per minute is 34. There are currently 160,000 tuberculosis patients in Shanghai, with 16,000 deaths each year, which is even greater than the total number of deaths from all infectious diseases in the city, with an average of 43 deaths per day. Moreover, China lacks tuberculosis prevention equipment, and most patients belong to the poor class. After suffering from this "disease of the wealthy," they are mostly unable to afford treatment, spreading the infection to others, creating a terrible situation. According to statistics, most tuberculosis patients in our country are between the ages of 15 and 35, and most deaths occur at the age of 25, indicating that those killed by tuberculosis bacteria are young people who are the pillars of the country, showing the depth of the harm.

American Red Cross Donates Hospital

Recently, the American Red Cross donated all the equipment for an anti-tuberculosis hospital in this city with a capacity of 250 beds, worth 600,000 US dollars, or 67 billion yuan in national currency, which will be shipped to China soon and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in May. The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis United Committee has launched a fundraising campaign to receive and enable ongoing work, in order to expand the city's anti-tuberculosis work. Yesterday at 6 p.m., the fundraising committee was held in the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. More than 50 leaders from all walks of life, including Yen Hui-ching, Kung Hsiang-hsi, Wu Kuo-chen, Chien Yung-ming, Hsu Chi-ching, Chin Run-ching, Ting Kuei-tang, Chen Hsing, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Wei, Gu Chunfan, Wang Renlin, and the textile, flour, and banking industries, attended. Speaker Pan was unable to attend due to leaving Shanghai, and Yen Hui-ching served as chairman, stating that the fundraising target was 1.5 billion, and hoping that all industries would provide more help.

Hospital Site Determined: Ye Family Garden

Subsequently, Wu Kuo-chen, Kung Hsiang-hsi, Hsu Chi-ching, Chien Yung-ming, Zhang Wei, and American Red Cross representative Madi were invited to speak successively, all agreeing that during and after the war, China's economy was defeated, people's lives were difficult, and nutrition was too poor, leading to the terrible spread of lung disease. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it is necessary to build the country, and the people must first have a healthy body. Otherwise, not only will they not be able to keep pace with foreign countries, but they will fall behind even further. Therefore, in order to seek national health, career development, and increased work efficiency, it is necessary not only to treat tuberculosis, but also to prevent tuberculosis, and expand the promotion to all parts of the country, providing assistance to those who are unable to afford treatment. For themselves and for their compatriots, they should contribute more to raising funds, completing the plan, and hoping that the media will promote it more to awaken people's attention to tuberculosis prevention. The donation form was distributed to all industries, with the goal of completing 1.5 billion yuan within two months. The site of the anti-tuberculosis hospital has been determined to be located in Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan.

### Executive Yuan Shanghai Branch Stops Distributing Buns and Congee

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan is curtailing its operations, and various relief efforts will be phased out according to their urgency.

### Overemphasizing Civil Affairs and Neglecting Military Affairs Led to the Fall of the Song and Ming Dynasties. The Ministry of National Defense Draws Lessons from History and Promotes the Significance of Conscription.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Garrison District Command recently telegraphed the Municipal Council, asking it to promote the significance of conscription, stating: "Approved by the Ministry of National Defense's Conscription Bureau: 'Chairman has forwarded a letter from Shanghai citizen Zhao Cheng, requesting that the conscription system be changed to a recruitment system, arguing that conscription has historically caused much harm in our country. Improvements only began after the Song dynasty changed to recruitment, and people resent the collusion of evil parties in military activities. An investigation reveals that the change to recruitment in the Song dynasty led to an overemphasis on civil affairs and a neglect of military affairs, resulting in weak military strength and the fall of the dynasty to the Yuan. Even after the Ming dynasty restored the country, it failed to address this weakness, and later fell to the Qing. After the Republic of China, repeated invasions by Japanese bandits due to weak military strength led to a situation where there was no way to pacify the local area internally and no way to prevent aggression externally. In view of this, the government promulgated the Conscription Law in the 22nd year and changed recruitment to conscription in the 25th year, so that the minimum number of standing armies can be trained in peacetime, and the maximum combat power can be exerted in wartime. Therefore, during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, the front-line combat power was infinitely replenished, and the Japanese bandits were finally made to kneel down. All this was due to conscription. Since the victory, military construction has been regarded as a century-long plan for nation-building, and military service is the foundation of military construction. Therefore, the Military Service Law has been drafted and promulgated with the intention of training all citizens in the country in order, retiring them on schedule, and giving them the knowledge of major events. Once the country is in trouble, they can rise up and fight, which is completely different from evil parties colluding to use citizens with no military knowledge as cannon fodder. We hope that you will conscientiously promote this.'

### Funding Issues Remain Unresolved: Conscription Survey Likely to Be Postponed

[Report from Our Newspaper] Gao Baoshu, Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Garrison District Command, stated that the Ministry of National Defense has ordered all garrison districts nationwide to complete the first phase of the conscription household survey by the end of April, and to immediately handle applications for exemption. In Shanghai, although the Military Affairs Section of the Municipal Government has been established, the funding required has not yet been approved by the Municipal Council, and various preparations by the section have not been completed. The conscription household survey will likely be postponed. As for the number of people in the city who will be conscripted and undergo national soldier training, the Ministry of National Defense will determine this based on the report of the conscription household survey and needs. It is not possible to predict this at present.

### Commander Xuan Releases Statement on Incident of Conflict Between Wounded Soldiers and Police: Ordered Investigation into the Truth of the Incident

Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu met with a reporter from the Central News Agency at 4 p.m. yesterday, stating that regarding the conflict between wounded soldiers and police on Chaoyang Road, Pingliang Road, and Meizhou Road the day before yesterday, he has ordered the Police Bureau, the Garrison Command, the Military Police Regiment, and the Wounded Soldiers Hospital to jointly investigate the truth of the incident and the causes of the escalation in order to determine right and wrong, and then decide on a handling plan. Wang Xianglin, director of the 20th Rear Hospital of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, visited Xuan yesterday afternoon to discuss the handling of the matter. Xuan hoped for two things: (1) The wounded soldiers established meritorious achievements during the Anti-Japanese War and should maintain this glory, leaving a good impression in the hearts of the people forever. (2) This matter should not be escalated further and can be handled leniently. Otherwise, in order to maintain public order, severe punishment will be imposed. Regarding the police firing their guns, the Police Bureau reported that it was because the gun was seized, while the wounded soldiers believed that it was intentional firing, each sticking to their own version of events. Xuan has also ordered a detailed investigation. According to regulations, the police may not fire their guns unless their lives are in extreme danger. Otherwise, it is excessive defense and will be subject to punishment.

### Coal Supply Is Not Smooth: Far Below Expectations. The Case Against the Fuel Management Committee Is Still Under Investigation.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of coal merchants suing the Fuel Management Committee is still under investigation, and the outcome is yet to be revealed. It is understood that the supply of coal in this city is far from the numbers expected by the Committee. For example, Taiwan hopes to supply 50,000 tons per month, but to date, it has only been around 40,000 tons. Qinhuangdao is scheduled to supply 100,000 tons per month, but in reality, it is only over 40,000 tons. It is hoped that Jiaozuo coal will supply 20,000 tons per month, but due to transportation difficulties, only 3,000 tons were shipped last month. The supply of Annam coal will soon end, as the supply of Vietnamese coal was agreed upon when our army was stationed in northern Vietnam, with a total of only 100,000 tons. Only a few ships are currently waiting to be transported. According to government orders, Vietnamese coal is prohibited from being exported in the future, so the relevant authorities are eagerly hoping to replace Vietnamese coal with Jiaozuo coal. Also, during the recent disturbances in Taiwan, coal mining equipment suffered damage. However, it is heard that the transportation of coal on land in Taiwan is still not very safe.

### Insufficient Coal for Two Railway Bureaus: Train Frequency to Be Reduced

However, the Fuel Management Committee only allocates 18,000 tons per month. Therefore, the bureau has decided to suspend non-essential extra trains, while the general train frequency will remain the same.

### Railway Bureau Seeks Train Safety: Orders Custom-Made Turnouts for Replacement

### Two Changes to the Method of Reporting Taxable Income for Businesses

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Emergency Economic Measures Plan included a provision to strengthen tax collection. According to the Direct Taxation Bureau, there are two differences in the way businesses report taxable income after the announcement of the plan: (1) Previously, after reporting, the bureau would review the accounts and then issue a notice to pay the tax. Now, after each business reports, the bureau will first notify the tax payment according to the reported amount, and then review the accounts to determine the taxable amount. (2) Previously, businesses had to report within one month after closing their accounts, but no later than March. Now, it is rigidly stipulated that all businesses must report before March 15, and recently it has been extended to April 15. To date, 40,000 units have reported.

### Captain of the Haitan Vessel Discusses His First Voyage to India

[Report from Our Newspaper] The first vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sailing on the China-India line, the Haitan, set sail from Shanghai on February 12 for Calcutta. It arrived here the day before yesterday, carrying 10,000 tons of supplies from India, and is currently unloading at the Qiujiang Wharf. According to the captain of the ship, Teng Shiyang, the voyage to India was slightly delayed when passing through Hong Kong and Singapore. It arrived in Calcutta on February 28 and entered the port on the morning of March 1 after mooring in the port for a spine. However, the longshoremen were on strike when it arrived in India, which delayed the loading and unloading of supplies for a considerable time. It was only on March 22 that the goods were fully loaded and the return journey began. The impression of India was very good, and the local overseas Chinese warmly welcomed them. The ship hosted overseas Chinese visitors, and the overseas Chinese hosted a banquet for the crew. The two sides were very harmonious, and they hoped that national ships would sail regularly.

### Central Asian Crew Requests Payment of Wages, Leading to a Quarrel: Patrolman Fires Gun to Disperse Crowd

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhongya ship managed by the Tongxing Shipping Company at No. 1 Zijin Street caught fire on its way from Shanghai to Jiujiang on the 7th of last month, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The families of the deceased crew members and the surviving crew members, totaling more than 40 people, went to the Tongxing Shipping Company at 4 p.m. yesterday to request the payment of one month's salary to maintain their livelihoods. After arriving there, many people argued loudly and suddenly had a dispute with the company's staff. The Huangpu Police Sub-bureau received the news and immediately ordered Patrolman Song to lead the police to suppress the situation, but to no avail. Some women lay on the streetcar tracks and refused to leave. Patrolman Song tried to persuade them, but was surrounded instead. He fired one shot to warn them, but fortunately no one was injured.

### The Four Defendants in the Fuxing Island Case: Insufficient Evidence, Declared Not Guilty

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fuxing Island case, which caused a sensation with its hidden gold, has been thoroughly investigated by Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao of the District Prosecutor's Office for three months. It was discovered that there was intense friction among the personnel of the Executive Yuan Fisheries Management Office stationed on the island. The so-called gold hidden in the bathtub was purely fabricated and used as a tool for infighting by means of false accusations. However, it was found that there was a phenomenon of stolen and sold enemy-left materials on the island. Regarding the false accusation, the prosecution was dismissed due to the amnesty. Li Yunpeng, Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui were prosecuted because they were more strongly suspected of selling stolen materials. After repeated court hearings and witness testimony, no concrete evidence of the defendants' crimes was obtained. Therefore, Li Yunpeng and the other three were declared not guilty yesterday morning.

### Seducing a Friend's Wife: Shameless Man and Woman Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Zhengqi, a 37-year-old native of Hubei province who works as a plank box maker, residing at No. 52, East Qipan Street, has one wife and one concubine. However, Yang often sought pleasure outside the home. On January 25th, at around 2 p.m., he went to the home of his fellow townsman, Li Jinhai, at No. 245 Hong’an Lane, Haining Road. As Li was away on business, Yang seduced Li's wife, Wu Guiying (18 years old, native of Hubei province), and together they went to the Xinguang Theater to watch a movie. In the following days, they went to the Daxin Hotel on Ningbo Road and engaged in physical relations. Subsequently, they often went to the theater together and had clandestine meetings. On March 25th, they went again to the Changfa Hotel in Nanrenzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road, and opened room No. 12. To avoid suspicion, they later changed to room No. 10. When Li Jinhai discovered the affair, at 8 p.m. on the 5th of this month, he invited Yang's relative, Li Zhiyong, and Yang's concubine, Yang Lu-shi, to rush into the room. They apprehended both of them and found a bicycle and stove in the room, which were Yang's daily necessities. They reported the matter to the Hongkou Police Station, and Inspector Jiang Tianfu and Sergeant Tang Cuncai were ordered to bring both parties to the station for questioning.

### Ninety Loads of Goose Feathers: Carrier Has Wicked Thoughts, Ship Owner's Private Sale is Exposed, Person and Stolen Goods Seized

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zu Zhuowu, a native of Wuhu, currently residing in room No. 28, No. 48 Jinlong Street, Shandong Road, entrusted ship owner Xiao Congqi (35 years old, native of Jiangxi) on February 16th of this year in his hometown to transport ninety loads of goose feathers to Shanghai. Because Zu did not send anyone to escort the ship, Xiao developed wicked intentions. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, he secretly sold the goose feathers to Sheng Hefang, the owner of Yuanfengsheng Fur Shop at No. 366 Zhengzheng Shandong Road, for a price of 200,000 yuan per load, totaling 16.6 million yuan. He received a partial payment of 2.4 million yuan. Xiao was originally a poor scholar. Once

He obtained this large sum of money,

after paying the crew's wages, he bought a watch for 180,000 yuan, a Parker fountain pen for 150,000 yuan, and a Zhongshan suit for 500,000 yuan. He lived extravagantly in hotels, seeking pleasure, and posing as a businessman. Since the goose feathers were shipped, Zu traveled via Nanjing to Shanghai, waiting for the goods to arrive, hoping to sell them at a good price. But after more than a month, there was no news.

Knowing something was amiss,

he inquired everywhere and asked about the ship at the docks along the river. Until the end of last month, he finally found Xiao's sailboat at the Yichang Road dock on the Suzhou Creek. He reported it to the Water Police Station, which dispatched officers to arrest Xiao and send him to the Criminal Investigation Section for interrogation. Xiao confessed everything. When the police went to the residence of the fence, Sheng Hefang, Sheng was not there. After further investigation, it was learned that Sheng had resold the goose feathers to Yang Fuquan, the owner of Yongsheng Wool Shop at No. 6 Songshou Lane, Beijing Road, on the 39th of the month for 310,000 yuan per load. Yang was arrested. After interrogation, he admitted the purchase, but claimed he did not know they were

Stolen goods.

The purchased goose feathers totaled 84 loads and 9 jin, valued at 25,938,300 yuan in legal tender. He had paid 8,938,300 yuan, with the remaining balance still outstanding. The goose feathers are currently stored in the Aisi warehouse of Longmao Stack in Pudong. Based on the confession, the police removed all the goose feathers and returned them to Zu Zhuowu. Xiao was transferred to the District Procuratorate yesterday on suspicion of embezzlement and selling stolen goods.

### Bizarre Things About the Baojia System: Requiring Labor for River Dredging and Extorting Fees

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council recently received a complaint from Zhang Boliang and other residents of the eighth Jia of the second Bao in the thirty-second district of this city, stating that someone claiming to be a Bao officer came and assigned residents of this Jia to dredge the river. If no one went, they would extort 45,000 yuan in legal tender. Zhang and others felt that this conscription for river dredging was abrupt because the district office had not convened a meeting of the public to announce it or distribute notices in advance, and there was no official announcement afterward. Moreover, neighboring Bao and Jia had not heard of any conscription. At the same time, the location of the river dredging was not specified. The actual situation is puzzling, so they requested the Municipal Council to investigate.

### Mayor's Cup Football Final: Donghua vs. Qingbai on Saturday

Weekend Qingbai Railway Junior Cup Final: Seoul, Korea Football Team First Game Against the Soviet Union

The Football Committee of the Municipal Sports Association announced the football schedule for this week yesterday. On Saturday at 3:00 PM, the Mayor's Cup Final will be between Donghua and Qingbai. On Sunday morning at 9:30 AM, the Junior Cup Final will be between Qingbai B and Railway. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, an international friendly match will be held between the Seoul, Korea football team and the Soviet Union. All three matches will be held at Yiyuan Stadium.

In the Mayor's Cup Final, Donghua will face Qingbai. Donghua has been undefeated throughout this year's league, winning the A-League championship. They have overcome all opponents in the Mayor's Cup to reach the final and will do their best to win the championship.

Qingbai was last year's double champion. After losing the league championship this year, they are determined to retain the Mayor's Cup. There are rumors that they have invited players from Hong Kong to help them. Xu Jingcheng, Zhang Jinhai, Li Zhaorong, and Feng Jingxiang are all said to be among those invited. However, whether these four players can come to Shanghai to participate in the match remains to be seen until the day of the game. It is expected that there will be a lively atmosphere on Shaanxi Road on Saturday.

In the Junior Cup Final, Qingbai B will face Railway. The two teams have played twice in the B-League, and their strengths are difficult to distinguish. This third encounter, competing for the Junior Cup, will surely be even more intense.

In the international friendly match, the Seoul, Korea football team will play its first match in Shanghai against the strong local team Soviet Union. However, the guest team has not yet arrived, and their strength is difficult to predict. The team has telegraphed that they will depart on the 9th.

April 12 (Saturday)

Donghua vs. Qingbai (Mayor's Cup Final) 3:00 PM

### Major Commodity Prices Suddenly Surge; Authorities Actively Seeking to Stabilize; Telegram Sent to Prohibit the Export of Edible Oil Raw Materials; Crackdown on Price Gouging and Smuggling in Rice-Producing Areas

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the economic emergency measures, commodity prices in this city have been relatively stable. However, due to the excessive amount of money in circulation and speculative capital seeking opportunities to move, commodity prices have recently begun to rise again, particularly for edible oil, rice, yarn, and cotton. Mayor Wu is paying close attention to this because of its significant impact on the lives of citizens. He stated while meeting with reporters yesterday afternoon that the main reason for the rise in edible oil prices is excessive exports. There is no oversupply of oil in this city, but the export of raw materials such as soybeans, sesame, and peanuts, as well as processed products, is continuous, resulting in supply falling short of demand and stimulating the rise in oil prices. To this end, the municipal government has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request a ban on the export of edible oil raw materials. It is believed that this ban will soon be conveyed by the Executive Yuan to the Customs Administration for implementation. The mayor stated that the amount of soybeans currently supplied to oil factories by the Food Administration is 8,000 tons per month.

The fluctuation in rice prices is mostly affected by miscellaneous grains. The mayor also pointed out another loophole: the government has long had explicit regulations prohibiting the transportation of rice to the north. Unexpectedly, recently, the Northern Gang has frequently been smuggling rice to the north, causing prices in producing areas such as Qingpu to gradually increase. Therefore, the municipal government has also requested the central government to strictly implement the economic emergency measures to investigate and crack down on smuggling. Rice prices should be able to gradually decline. The amount of rice currently under government control is substantial, so it will certainly not have an impact.

The price of yarn and cotton is expected to be suppressed in the short term. A large quantity of yarn and cotton from the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has already arrived. In addition, foreign exchange has been settled for 200,000 bales of cotton, which can be imported immediately. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently discussing the official price of this American cotton with the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which should be announced soon. The mayor concluded by saying that Shanghai is prone to fluctuations due to too many rumors.

[Additional News] It is reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently stated that the soaring oil prices in various regions are related to the large-scale export of edible oil. Therefore, it has specifically ordered the relevant authorities in various regions to temporarily prohibit the export of edible oil starting immediately. The possibility of opening up exports will be considered again after the oil supply is sufficient.

### National Bank Convenes Representatives from the Rice, Flour, and Oil Industries to Discuss How to Balance Market Prices; Regular Roundtable Meetings Scheduled Every Friday

[Report from Our Newspaper] Central Bank President Zhang and Deputy President Liu convened representatives from the rice, flour, and oil industries in this city at the Central Bank conference room yesterday afternoon at approximately 5:00 PM, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM. At the meeting yesterday, President Zhang stated that he had been away from Shanghai for more than ten years and was eager to understand the situation of various industries in this city upon his return. Recently, the central government has been determined to stabilize general commodity prices. However, because food prices often lead general commodity prices, he specifically convened representatives from the rice, flour, and oil industries to discuss (1) how to replenish Shanghai's grain reserves, (2) how to suppress grain prices, and (3) how to balance grain prices with general commodity prices. Representatives from various industries expressed their opinions. The rice merchants were the first to express their opinions, stating: (1) This city consumes 500,000 shi of rice per month, but recently the price of rice in Shanghai has been lower than in the producing areas, resulting in a reverse price phenomenon. Currently, Shanghai grain merchants have only 150,000 shi of grain in hand. In addition, recently, a large amount of rice has been privately exported from Zhenjiang and Wuhu. It is hoped that the government will pay attention to this. (Regarding this point, the National Bank stated that Minister Gu of the Food Administration has sent officials to the two regions to stop it.) (2) Transportation should be given priority to grain merchants. In addition, grain merchants cannot withstand the pressure of high-interest loans. It is hoped that the government will provide low-interest loans. At the same time, it is hoped that the government will regularly maintain 100,000 tons of rice in Shanghai for sale when rice prices fluctuate. (Regarding this point, the National Bank stated that the government does have 100,000 tons of grain in Shanghai, and 60,000 tons of rice can arrive in Shanghai from Saigon and Siam within the next month.) (3) It is hoped that the government will use all the daily necessities and cakes in its possession to exchange for grain from the countryside at fair prices, so as to avoid harming farmers due to low grain prices. Next, the flour merchants expressed their opinions, stating: Last year, the flour mills in this city obtained 3 million dan of wheat in the Ruju area of northern Jiangsu, which was sufficient to meet the needs of the flour industry in this city. This year, it is still hoped that the government will provide flour mills with the convenience of purchasing wheat in the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and northern Jiangsu areas. At the same time, it is hoped that the government will expedite the purchase of foreign wheat and provide manufacturers with low-interest loans. If the supply of flour in this city is surplus, then free export should be permitted. (The National Bank stated that the authorities have finalized 100,000 tons of foreign wheat, which can be transported to Shanghai in batches.) Finally, the oil merchants expressed their opinions, stating: It is hoped that the government will help solve the raw material problem. Private factories have already ordered more than 5,000 tons of soybeans from the Northeast. It is hoped that they will be allowed to be exported. (President Zhang of the National Bank stated that the private factories should first submit an application, which will be forwarded to the Northeast Economic Commission for handling. In addition, the China Trust Bureau will supply 8,000 tons of soybeans per month starting this month to resolve the issue of raw material supply.)

In addition, at the meeting yesterday, it was decided that Deputy President Liu of the National Bank will convene representatives from the rice, flour, and oil industries once every Friday in the future to discuss and resolve the difficulties of various industries at any time.

### Social Affairs Bureau to Convene Price Evaluation Committee

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, has just returned from sweeping tombs in Qingpu. When reporters asked him about the various issues related to price management in this city, he replied that now that commodity prices have fluctuated and risen, from the perspective of the Social Affairs Bureau, it is intended to minimize various artificial actions. The convening of the Price Evaluation Committee cannot be delayed any longer, so as to strengthen the binding force of market fluctuations. It has now been decided to first gather the various groups for discussion and then submit them to the general meeting for endorsement. Today (the 8th), the edible oil group and the sugar group will be convened first. In addition, the firewood and charcoal groups will be convened on the 9th. Among them, the original coal group will be changed to the firewood and charcoal group. The general meeting is scheduled to be formally held at the Social Affairs Bureau at noon on the 10th (Thursday). In addition to making a preliminary decision on the evaluation of the various groups, it is especially necessary to make a comprehensive plan for the management methods proposed by each group, so that they can be effectively implemented and achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### Black Market for Sugar Rampant

14th Round of Sugar Allocation Awaiting Consultation

Recently, because the market price of sugar in the producing areas is higher than in Shanghai, foreign ports have changed to purchasing from this city. The sugar industry in this city is also affected by the current loose monetary policy, so after receiving the allocated sugar, many are unwilling to easily sell it off, and the black market is becoming more rampant. It is learned that in order to suppress the sugar black market, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a sugar price evaluation meeting for this Wednesday, and will re-adjust the allocated price of sugar. Therefore, it is said that whether the 14th round of sugar allocation by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation this Thursday can be opened as scheduled still awaits consultation with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs before a decision can be made.

In other news, yesterday, the sugar market did not open due to the association's suspension of trading, and Taiwan Sugar had no transactions. The source of local sugar was scarce, and the production price gradually increased, so the opening price had a tendency to tighten.

### Three Organizations Boost Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Prices; Textile Construction Sales Prices Increase Periodically; Public Sentiment Rises and Out-of-Town Sales Flourish

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market's upward trend intensified, and cotton prices jumped repeatedly. Because yarn factories could not replenish raw materials, they were generally unwilling to sell coarse and fine cotton yarn, causing the price of 10-count yarn in the market to rise by another 10,000 per count. 32-count fine yarn and 42-count double-strand yarn were particularly sought-after, jumping by 400,000. Public sentiment was unprecedentedly high. Because Textile Construction is still increasing prices periodically, out-of-town sales are not deserted, so the trend remains strong.

Cotton cloth showed a good trend on Saturday. Recently, due to an increase in purchases by out-of-town merchants, actual sales have flourished, and cotton stocks are depleted. The sharp rise in yarn prices has stimulated the cotton cloth market, causing the prices of various grades of fine cloth to rise. Subsequently, the director of the industry association notified a suspension of trading, which ultimately resulted in off-market transactions. It is said that 12-pound Longtou fine cloth recently sold for nearly 180,000, and buyers were very enthusiastic.

The cotton market is still hindered by inconvenient transportation, and the source of supply is still not smooth. Stocks are dwindling daily, and yarn factories have strong demand. Public sentiment is quite firm, and selling prices are unusually high. Yesterday, Shenxin Yarn Factory received Pudong Huoji cotton, and Dacheng Yarn Factory received Hankou fine velvet cotton. Some colleagues also traded Hankou fine velvet cotton, each about 100 to 200 bales.

At 10:30 AM yesterday, representatives Qu Zhenhua, Zhang Xichao, Gu Yisheng, Xu Songren, and Cha Baoshan visited Mayor Wu to present their difficulties and request that the mayor find a way to lower prices in the producing areas. The mayor agreed to help and telegraphed the Ministry of Food to request approval to do so. At the same time, the Nanshi Market Management Committee decided to temporarily set the price of White Geng rice including commission at 122,000 yuan to maintain the capital of rice merchants, which is a relaxation of 12,000 yuan compared to before. The door-to-door sales price is stipulated not to exceed 130,000 yuan. The official new negotiated price will be determined after the establishment of the Municipal Price Evaluation Committee.

### Japan Under Control

— Chen Xunyu (II)

The Practice of Allied Headquarters' Control Over Japan for a Year and a Half

The comprehensive control plan for Japan after the Allied occupation was approved and publicly released by US President Truman on September 22, 1945. This document, widely known as the "US Initial Post-Surrender Policy Toward Japan," served as the guiding principle for the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers and relevant US government departments in controlling Japan. To help readers easily understand the entire control policy and its implementation, the third and fourth parts (political and economic) of the document are summarized as follows:

The third part (political) of the document first pointed out that the main task of the Allied occupation of Japan was to disarm the Japanese military and eliminate the source of Japanese militarism. The Japanese people should clearly recognize the shackles and suffering imposed upon them by the leaders of the Japanese army and navy and their collaborators. To eliminate this suffering, the Allies had to implement the following necessary measures:

(1) Japan must no longer have armies, navies, secret police organizations, or civil aviation enterprises; (2) Dissolve the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and disarm them; (3) Dissolve the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, the General Staff Office, and all secret police; (4) Immediately surrender all Japanese army and navy weapons, equipment, warships, and other military facilities, including military and civilian aircraft; (5) Senior military officers from the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, the General Staff Office, and government agencies, as well as the leaders who promoted Japanese extreme nationalism and militarism, and the main perpetrators of aggressive wars, should be immediately arrested and subjected to punishment; Well-known figures who had engaged in militaristic and extreme nationalistic activities in the past should also be immediately deprived of their public office; All extreme militaristic groups, whether social, political, or commercial, should be dissolved and prohibited from engaging in activities; (6) Military training doctrines and militaristic activities in the education system should be eliminated; (7) Former army and navy officers and non-commissioned officers, as well as those who had engaged in militaristic or extreme nationalistic activities, should not be allowed to participate in education.

Secondly, the document pointed out that the focus of the trial of Japanese war criminals should not only be on the passive punishment of war criminals but also on the active pursuit of lasting peace for the world and mankind. Therefore, those who had committed atrocities against prisoners of war and people of the United Nations, and those designated as war criminals by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers or the United Nations, should be tried and executed.

Thirdly, the document clearly instructed the necessary measures for developing human freedom and promoting democratic policies: (1) The Japanese people should fully recognize freedom of religion and should not use religion as a pretext for any activities of extreme nationalism or militarism; (2) Respect freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and protect all democratic political parties; (3) Repeal and amend all laws that create unequal treatment based on differences in race, nationality, belief, political opinion, etc.; (4) Release political prisoners.

Regarding the economy, the document (Part IV) emphasized that Japan should move towards non-military production. Therefore: (1) Any military forces remaining on the old economic foundation should be destroyed first; (2) The production of any military facilities and equipment is strictly prohibited; (3) The use of any equipment in the production or repair of naval vessels and aircraft is strictly prohibited; (4) All economic sectors must be strictly supervised and controlled to prevent hidden or disguised economic activities; (5) Abolish any production departments related to war preparations; (6) Strictly prohibit any specific research aimed at strengthening war; (7) Limit the character and scope of Japan's new heavy industry; (8) Restrict the production of merchant ships to prevent their conversion for military use.

The following key points are related to the reconstruction of a peaceful economy: (1) Industrial and agricultural groups organized on a democratic basis should be encouraged; (2) Destroy monopolistic economic forces and eliminate all obstacles to a peaceful and democratic economic system; (3) The Japanese people should be responsible for economic reconstruction, especially for the immediate and thorough reform of the old economic system and its activities, so that the domestic economy moves towards a peaceful path. To achieve this goal, the Japanese government should implement the following: (1) Prevent the occurrence of extreme economic hardship; (2) Fairly allocate all materials; (3) Surrender all materials designated by the United Nations for reparations; (4) Promote all reasonable and peaceful undertakings sufficient to satisfy the aspirations of the Japanese people. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, the document specifically pointed out: (1) Surrender all Japanese assets overseas, to be properly distributed by the United Nations; (2) Immediately surrender all existing materials that are harmful to peace and not necessary for peacetime; (3) Immediately surrender all assets plundered from the United Nations.

The Japanese government should assume full responsibility for managing its domestic finances, currency, and debt under the supervision of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. At the same time, the Japanese government should export some goods under the conditions permitted by the Allied Headquarters to exchange for necessary raw materials imported from overseas. In addition, Japan's overseas assets and assets lost due to surrender, whether owned by the imperial family or the government, should be listed and reported to the Allied Headquarters for verification and handling; Other measures for the imperial family should also be implemented in accordance with this policy to carry out the mission of the Allied occupation. The Japanese government shall not grant any country exclusive or preferential opportunities, nor shall it use industrial organizations to carry out the above activities.

In the early stages of the occupation, the Allied control policy towards Japan was largely listed in this document. Later, there were many supplements on individual economic and political issues in Japan, but in spirit and policy, it was consistent and there was no deviation. The implementation was also quite smooth. Whether it was the new political facilities or the disarmament of the Japanese military, they were largely completed within this year and a half. The Allied Headquarters also quickly dealt with Japanese war criminals. On January 30 last year, the Allied Headquarters promulgated the Far East International Tribunal Organization Regulations, which was composed of representatives from eleven Allied countries, including China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The issue of war crime trials will be discussed in detail in another article, and will not be repeated here. Before the promulgation of the Far East International Tribunal Organization Regulations, the Allied Headquarters had already issued arrest warrants on January 4 last year for all officials who had promoted militarism in Japanese government agencies. At the same time, it ordered the dissolution of all national entities that had promoted militarism, totaling 27 units. It also ordered the Japanese government to prohibit leaders of militarism from holding public office, from serving as members of the House of Peers or the House of Representatives, or as prefectural governors or mayors. The following officials who are currently in office should be dismissed immediately if they have any of the following:

(A) War criminals. (B) Professional army and navy officers. (C) Powerful figures of extreme nationalist groups, violent groups, and secret patriotic groups. (D) Figures related to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society, and the Greater Japan Political Association. (E) Important officials of financial institutions or development agencies related to the aggressive war. (F) Administrative heads of occupied areas. (G) Other militarists and extreme nationalists.

On October 25, it ordered the Japanese government to cease the activities of overseas envoys. On November 4, it ordered the cessation of diplomatic negotiations between the Japanese government in Tokyo and neutral countries.

On May 23 last year, it issued an order to abolish the special privileges of the imperial family, such as tax exemptions, and to tax the assets of 14 imperial families in accordance with the law.

On the positive side, on October 4 the previous year, the Allied Headquarters issued an order: abolishing all restrictions on political civil rights and freedom of religion, and abolishing all regulations established based on differences in race, nationality, belief, and political opinion.

In terms of finance and economy, the Allied Headquarters issued Directive No. 3 on September 22 of the previous year, giving instructions on the key points of the economic policies that the Japanese government should adopt in the future. The main points are as follows:

(1) The fundamental principle of economic policy should focus on ensuring the minimum living standard of the general public. To ensure the minimum living standard, all domestic human and material resources should be concentrated on the production of essential materials for life.

(2) Regarding the distribution of essential materials for life, the government should implement strong control and ensure fair distribution.

In terms of financial control, on September 22, the Allied Headquarters ordered the Japanese government to provide comprehensive financial information on each bank, insurance company, and other financial institutions and the imperial family financial regulations.

On January 24 last year, to prevent inflation, the Allied Headquarters instructed the Japanese government on three principles: (1) Government spending should be reduced to a minimum. (2) Financial deficits should be filled with national savings. (3) The Bank of Japan and general banks should not be used to fill budget deficits.

On October 20 of the previous year, it ordered the freezing of funds from colonial banks. On November 6, it ordered the freezing of the assets of the four major Zaibatsu (namely Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, and Sumitomo). Then on December 11, it also issued a freezing order on the funds of 336 companies affiliated with 18 enterprise companies controlled by the Japanese Zaibatsu. On November 25, it promulgated the War Profits Tax Law and suspended the military pension system. Starting on June 4 last year, it also ordered restrictions on the personal financial activities of the ten major Zaibatsu (namely Ayukawa, Asano, Kawasaki, Furukawa, Matsushita, Nakajima, Nomura, Okawauchi, Okura, and Osawa), and strictly regulated their family living expenses.

In terms of trade, on November 24 of the previous year, the import of items such as rice, salt, cotton, and oil was permitted. At the same time, items such as coal, silk, silkworm eggs, asphalt, and kiln wood were listed as export items. There have also been many improvements in labor laws. For example, the Directive for the Removal of Labor Suppression issued on November 10 last year and the Relief of Unemployment Act promulgated on December 3 are relatively significant and important measures.

Regarding the economic system, the December 9 order on the reform of the agricultural land system should be specifically noted, and the detailed methods will be described later.

In guiding free, democratic, and peaceful thought training and the education system, the Allied Headquarters' achievements in this year and a half cannot be ignored. Its most active expressions in terms of directives include: (1) Regulations prohibiting geographical, historical, moral, and other subjects with militaristic or extreme nationalistic qualities (January 3); Canceling regulations restricting book publications (February 28); Stipulating ten principles for newspaper publishing based on freedom of news reporting (September 21); Canceling regulations restricting news, telegraphs, and communications (September); Promulgating directives on democratic re-education policies (October 22); Canceling regulations on the public prostitution system (February 24); Abolishing the Japanese government's law establishing Shintoism as the state religion (December 15). In short, the issuance of all these laws has provided unlimited assistance in liberating the Japanese people, enabling them to obtain the freedom to develop their individuality and enjoy the basic human rights they have been craving in the past. The above only reveals a few key points, and the detailed and specific content cannot be fully listed within this limited space. I will describe them in detail separately later.

### Democracy Train is Departing! (Part 1)

— Chen Guyuan

(1) "I Can Bestow It, I Can Take It Back"

The National Government, on March 31st, issued an order to promulgate ten laws regarding the preparation for constitutional rule. This was done according to Article 2 of the "Preparatory Procedures for Implementing the Constitution" resolved by the National Assembly and submitted to the National Government for promulgation, completing the process within the allotted time. Of the ten laws, four are election and recall laws, and six are organizational laws. In addition, there are implementing regulations for the election and recall of National Assembly representatives, legislative members, supervisory committee members, and various election and recall laws, as well as allocation tables for the number of National Assembly representatives and legislative members, which are still awaiting legislative procedures. The drafting of these laws was based on the spirit of a democratic constitution by the National Defense Supreme Council, which determined the principles of various laws and absorbed as much as possible the opinions of various parties and factions, social elites, and the technical contributions of scholars and experts. After the draft was submitted to the Legislative Yuan, in addition to the principles indicated by the legislative principles, the legislative workers spent three weeks, without weekends or holidays, working day and night to deliberate and study, seeking to make it more suitable for the expression of democracy. Not only did various parties and factions, social elites, and experts gather together to argue right and wrong, but also about two-thirds of the 150 legislative members were National Assembly representatives, and the opinions of the people were also revealed. In order to prepare for the departure of the democracy train, everyone embraced a spirit of great comfort, dispelling physical fatigue. Especially at the time when the democracy train was about to depart, the late committee member Zhang Fengjiu, at the age of 66, spoke with tense emotions and died in the parliamentary hall for the sake of democracy. This not only did not dishearten everyone but increasingly stimulated everyone's belief in democracy, striving to push this train forward, so that it could ignite and set off, and drive towards the avenue of democracy!

We are one of the selected representatives of the National Assembly for the formulation of the constitution, and also one of the initial reviewers in the Constitutional Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan. Since we have participated in these matters from beginning to end, we are more familiar with the mission represented by these ten laws and the meaning of their provisions. Now that these laws have been promulgated, we are specially responding to the invitation of our newspaper's reporter to give a brief introduction to this democracy train. However, due to time and space limitations, this article will only focus on the four election and recall laws. At the same time, I must first declare that I do not want to speak from the standpoint of parties or legislative workers; I would very much like to provide commentary based on objective views and the tenets of scholarship. What I want to say is:

The four election and recall laws are not only unprecedented in our country, but also not commonly seen in countries around the world. Although all countries in the world recognize the election system, the adoption of the recall system is not the case in every country. If a citizen cannot exercise the right to recall after electing their representatives, they cannot control the actions of the representatives. As a result, it creates the autocracy of a few elected people, and the people have no sovereignty to speak of except for a brief moment of freedom when voting. This is what scholars all over the world criticize. Our country has actually adopted the recall system, making it cooperate with the election system. People with suffrage will be happy to say, "I can bestow it, I can take it back." Under this circumstance, although every citizen is limited by reality and cannot personally participate in central government affairs, it has fully demonstrated the spirit of sovereignty residing in the people. This is truly worthy of being written in large letters and specially recorded first!

Furthermore, although the election system does not start today, striving to make it conform to the spirit of democracy and be a fully progressive measure is also a brand-new regulation. The election of representatives to the National Assembly and members of the Legislative Yuan specifically stipulates that "election procedures shall be conducted publicly" and that candidates shall "campaign publicly," and the principles of universal, equal, direct, etc., as well as the methods of secret ballot and single ballot, are specified at the forefront of each election and recall law. These were originally stipulated in the constitution, but because universal and direct elections are more difficult, more attention must be paid to the regulations. The adoption of the single transferable vote method is also to prevent the abuses that can easily occur with the cumulative voting method, and there is no other way. The President and Vice President are elected by the National Assembly, and supervisory committee members are elected by provincial and municipal councils and the Tibetan local council overseas Chinese groups. This is to take indirect elections according to the Constitution. Although the President and Vice President are elected by the people, they are servants of the people, unlike the National Assembly representatives who represent the entire people in exercising political power, nor are they like the legislative members who represent the people in exercising legislative power. Since the people are not electing their own representatives, it is not necessary to use direct elections for the convenience of conducting elections. Although supervisory committee members are still representatives of the people, their essence lies in representing the people of each local group, equivalent to the members of the upper house of various countries. Therefore, supervisory committee members, except for those from overseas Chinese groups, are all elected by the members of the local councils elected by the people, which is exactly in line with the so-called meaning of representing the local. Therefore, the nature of the two election and recall laws for the President and Vice President is very similar, and there is a natural division between them and the two election and recall laws for the National Assembly representatives and legislative members. The above is my general observation on the four election and recall laws.

(2) Establishing Electoral Units to Protect the Weak in the Election Campaign

Among the four election and recall laws, except for the fact that there is no dispute over the number of presidential and vice-presidential seats and the number of supervisory committee members has been determined in the constitution, the allocation of seats for National Assembly representatives and legislative members requires much research. The allocation of women's seats in the supervisory committee also needs to be resolved.

There are a total of eight types of elections for National Assembly representatives and six types of elections for legislative members. According to Article 135 of the Constitution, citizens with special inland customs only elect National Assembly representatives, and the number of women legislative members is allocated to various types of elections instead of being elected separately by women's groups, so there are two fewer units in the various types of elections for legislative members. Since supervisory committee members represent the local area, in addition to citizens residing abroad, who only elect eight supervisory committee members due to special reasons, there are also no two units for various ethnic groups in border areas and professional groups. Various ethnic groups in border areas refer to indigenous peoples, scattered in various southwestern provinces, that cannot have a province within a province to independently elect supervisory committee members.

The total number of National Assembly representatives still needs to be determined by calculating the population of each county and city, but it is at least 2,937, and at most it will not increase by more than a few in the calculation of numbers. The number of National Assembly representatives for constitutional rule exceeds one-third of the number of National Assembly representatives for constitution-making, and hundreds of party representatives from the constitution-making period have been reduced among them, which can be said to be closer to democracy. If it were not for space constraints, the more the better, which is a manifestation of national politics that no country has achieved. Legislative members are constantly involved in politics and law-making, and too many people will make it difficult to have high efficiency. Although a quota of 500 was not passed during the formulation of the constitution, it should not deviate too far from this number. The 728 seats in the draft election and recall law for legislative members still seem to be too many, while the number of seats allocated to Mongolian, Tibetan, overseas Chinese, and various ethnic groups in border areas seems to be too few. Therefore, reduce what should be reduced and increase what should be increased. The elections of various special units for National Assembly representatives may be limited by the precedent of the constitution-making National Assembly, and reluctantly maintain a ratio in the number of seats. The nature of legislative members is different, and since the constitution authorizes the law to formulate the allocation of seats for various special units, it is natural to make a reasonable decision on the numbers from the spirit of democracy. Fortunately, the constitution has provisions for the allocation of seats for supervisory committee members, which eliminates much dispute.

### The Woman Who Walks the Dog

— Yin Xueman

My younger brother came to Shanghai from the countryside specifically to see the world and try to find some work. But in these times, what place isn't suffering from famine? Naturally, he couldn't find work, so he stayed temporarily at my place.

The lane where I live is very wide and quiet. Therefore, many people from the leisurely class spend their mornings and evenings chatting idly and pacing back and forth here. But what attracts my attention the most is a woman who leads a Pekingese dog around all day, doing nothing.

One morning, as usual, I was about to go out. Unexpectedly, my younger brother ran over excitedly. He seemed to have discovered something big, with a tense expression, and said, "Brother, how come there's a woman herding dogs here?"

When I heard this, I couldn't help but laugh. My younger brother is a very unsophisticated country person; in our hometown, we always use the word "fang" (放, to release) as "mu" (牧, to herd), so he thought the woman was herding the dog.

I said, "What do you want her to do? She has nothing to do after eating!"

My younger brother understood even less. After hearing my words, he was stunned for a long time before he stammered and asked embarrassedly, "Then, how does she live?"

My younger brother meant, what does she rely on to live? I couldn't explain it clearly for a moment, so I said, "You have nothing to do, you can study her and see how she lives."

He nodded in agreement. From then on, he seemed to pay special attention to the woman's daily life, actions, and the people coming and going from her house. Not long after, one night he ran to me and said:

"I found out! I found out! She's making money by taking a cut from gambling, right?"

I said, "Maybe, but maybe not necessarily; you can take another look."

After several days passed, he excitedly said to me again:

"Brother, this time I'm sure I can guess right, I've discovered her secret."

"You've discovered her secret?" I asked, feigning surprise.

"Yes, her secret. Do you believe it? I'll tell you."

I deliberately shook my head again, indicating that I couldn't quite believe it. And I said with a somewhat doubtful tone, "I'm afraid it's not accurate, right? You can discover her secret?"

"Really." My younger brother's face flushed with anxiety. "I followed her for several afternoons, and she always went to dance halls with one or two men. But those men are never the same one or two people, as if they change every two days. Because I wasn't paying much attention, I can't remember clearly. She's making money by 'selling dances,' right?"

I couldn't help but laugh again. "'Selling dances' is a new term. Seeing me laugh, he immediately felt embarrassed, knowing that he was wrong again this time.

"How mysterious! What exactly does she do for a living?" My younger brother couldn't help but feel melancholy.

After I laughed, I said, "Yes, there are many such mysterious women in Shanghai. Who knows what they do for a living?"

My younger brother stared at the ceiling, stunned. Although this question was more difficult to answer than an arithmetic problem, it was more interesting than an arithmetic problem. Therefore, the woman who walks the dog had an even more mysterious allure for him.

"I will always discover her secret." Finally, he said to me with great confidence. "Anyway, I have nothing to do, I might as well learn from Sherlock Holmes."

"Good courage." I said with a smile; "Just don't become a Don Quixote-style Sherlock Holmes."

"No matter what, you will always admire me in the future."

I said that I naturally hope that Don Quixote. Holmes, can also have amazing success. But before he succeeds, I don't have much hope

Quickly passed? Because I was busy, I almost forgot about this matter. What about my younger brother? He seemed to just sit on the sofa and read books every day, and never mentioned it to me again. I was surprised that he didn't look like Sherlock Holmes or Don Quixote in the story, looking for clues everywhere, or making jokes. And I was also particularly surprised by his quietness and his sense of duty.

But, this night, he suddenly rushed in from outside the door. At that time, I had just returned from the newspaper office and was reading an article criticizing current affairs in the evening newspaper. But his expression told me that he had encountered something unexpected. Because after he came in, he was stunned when he saw me. His face was flushed red, and even his eyes were shining red. But his lips were pale, and his legs were a little shaky. He looked at me as if he had done something wrong, and his face revealed inner terror and panic.

I let him calm down, then said, "You, what's wrong?"

They still stared at me blankly, without saying a word.

"What did you encounter?" I said, looking at his face.

When he heard my words, his whole body seemed to tremble! His legs also seemed unable to continue to provide strong support, his lower body softened, and he fell to the ground.

I was shocked at this time, and quickly got up and helped him up. This child, who was only eighteen years old, began to cry in sobs.

After I made him calm, he said, "Brother, will the woman who walks the dog come to our place?"

"Why would she come to our place?" I tried my best to comfort him and said, "What did you encounter?"

"She, that woman who walks the dog." My younger brother glanced at me shamefully, and continued, "These past few days, I've been seeing her wandering on the street and in the hall every night. She, she brings a strange man back every night."

"Oh, is that so?" I said.

"Her dog is just a signboard." This poor Don Quixote. Holmes continued, "But that little dog is very fierce!"

"Did it bite you?" I asked with concern

"Yes". He said: "Tonight, this woman who walks the dog discovered that I was continuing to follow her, so she turned east and west, and I unknowingly followed her to her door. After arriving at the door, I couldn't help myself, and two tall men pushed and pulled me, and caught me in like a little chick."

"What happened then?"

"I was so scared that I shouted for help. But the woman who walks the dog hugged me in her arms, she smiled at me, she kissed my face, she hugged me tightly. She said: 'Little brat, would you like to sleep in this fur?' I struggled desperately, I said I wanted to leave, would you let me go? If you don't let me go, I'll keep shouting for help!"

"She let you go?"

"Later she teased me, but those two men didn't agree. They said: 'Little brat, leave the money behind! Do you think you can play with the girl for free'?"

"Then you……"?

They started to move while they were talking, and I couldn't resist even if I wanted to. They emptied my pockets, and threw me out with a pat."

I couldn't help but laugh again. I said to him, "Didn't get hurt, right?"

"It's okay, no". He rubbed his hands at this time, brushed the dust off his clothes and pants, and looked at me embarrassedly.

"I told you that your Sherlock Holmes is not working, how is it? When the time comes, you are still a Don Quixote."

He smiled bitterly. After a long time, he said, "I should still go back to the countryside."

### Thoughts on Early Spring in England

— An Zi

The bitter snowy winter is gone,

The coal shortage and power outages will become a topic in British history.

Today there is brilliant sunshine,

Patches of white clouds drift across the blue sky,

Every small branch stands tall and has vitality,

Some have already burst out with resolute green buds. The grass in the park is so loose, wet, and soft,

Melted snow water is still hidden in the decaying grass;

The ponds covered with snow and ice ripple again,

Gulls and swans all tell people that spring has arrived!

The female tourists in the park have also changed into spring clothes,

Colorful like butterflies dancing among the flowers;

Golden soft silk lifts in the wind,

Everywhere is a smile in response to this thriving business

Only my heart is like an ancient well

Perhaps because it has long been left behind in the motherland!

The motherland has such simple nature,

I have spent countless sweet spring days in its embrace.

Now it is past Grain Rain, and Qingming will be here in an instant,

On Ming Tomb Road, I imagine it is already covered with flowers?

The weeping willows by the Back Lake are brewing green clouds?

Who is treading the green grass by Yuhuatai?

Nanjing nurtured all my spring dreams,

Although I have also been intoxicated by the May of the old capital and the tenderness of the West Lake!

The spring of Guilin is stepping hurriedly,

But how much warmth is also left on those mountain peaks and watersides;

We dreamed in a boat in Yangshuo, listening to the gentle waves,

Found a home for our hearts and created our youth.

Panxi has red camellias breaking the loneliness of mountain living,

And the blooming peach blossoms by the water are always new!

I once took my daughter to climb a small hill for a nap,

The sunshine in March was covered by fragrant grass

I watched as the edges of the valley plains gradually unfolded,

After the spring rains, the Jialing River turned yellow and then green several times!

Indeed, everything in the motherland is somewhat chaotic and barren,

But there is unadorned beauty there;

Life in the motherland is so difficult and close to dangerous,

But there is a deeper love there.

My heart grew from the fields of the motherland,

I love it and understand it like my own life!

I know that spring in the motherland may arrive later,

But it must be more beautiful, more magnificent, brighter, and last longer,

How much I long to return to the embrace of the motherland,

Even if there is no spring there forever!

### Beggar

— Lan Hui

Bring out hunger

Display illness

On the streets decorated beautifully

Auction off pain in public

Like a farmer in the long drought of June thirsting for the rain that the sky stingily sells

You are on the indifferent and heartless sidewalk

Begging for the rare compassion of the world

Hope supports you to walk towards others

But despair constantly pushes you away

You really should cry for this ungrateful world

In the harmony of decorating falsehood

You use a real, tearing voice

Angrily strike at those shameful smiles

(Old manuscript, September 9, 1946)

### Sowing

— Guo He

Guo He Van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch painter who became famous in France and was a freak. He was compassionate from childhood, so he went to the mine and lived with the miners, he also served as a pastor and preached. Until the age of twenty-seven, he felt that his heart was full of passion and no one accepted it, and finally started painting, venting all his emotions on the surface. The subjects are mostly rural villages, especially the sun, resulting in poisoning, going crazy, cutting off his own ear and sending it to the person he was single-mindedly in love with. After recovering from the illness, he continued to create many masterpieces, but he died young at the age of forty-seven! Historians classify him as a post-impressionist. His style has had a great influence on modern times, and this work is representative of his sketches. (Lion)

### Record of the Gongchuo Hall

— Wu Baofeng

In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ye Yuhu (Gongchuo) was the head of the Ministry of Transportation, and for the sake of widely cultivating specialized talents, he merged the four schools under the Ministry of Transportation: Shanghai and Tangshan Industrial Special Schools, Beijing Post and Telecommunications, and the Transportation Training Institute, into Jiaotong University. The board of directors nominated Mr. to serve as the president concurrently. Mr. used his unique powers, extraordinary knowledge, high vision, and long-term planning to lay the foundation. He also engaged in the reform and improvement of school affairs with meticulousness, candor, and openness. As a result, the four schools, which were independent and unconnected, were brought under the same supervision and management, increasing departments and equipment, expanding facilities, and actively developing into the highest institution of learning. Furthermore, believing that transportation talents cannot be closed off, he ordered graduates to be assigned to various transportation agencies for internships. Also, believing that transportation enterprises in various countries were changing rapidly and cannot be complacent, he stipulated that all graduates with excellent grades should be sent abroad for further study. As a result, the alumni of this school were all excellent in both learning and experience, and talents emerged in large numbers, serving as pillars of the country for a long time. During the Anti-Japanese War, transportation had to cooperate with military affairs, and the principals of railways, highways, aviation, and telecommunications construction were mostly from this school, and all the alumni were able to give full play to their strengths, endure hardships and be indomitable, and risk their lives to achieve the final victory. When drinking water, remember the source, all of which is due to the hard work of Mr. Hongmo and the pioneering power. April 8th of this year is the 51st anniversary of the school. Colleagues think of the infinite teaching and think of the great future. They are deeply respectful to Mr., and unanimously agreed to rename the Engineering Hall Gongchuo Hall, and build a statue in an area to be immortal. Baofeng has always been appreciated and rewarded, and has also been following the rules. I respectfully present a small article to mark the grand event. When I come to Ying, I can't help but admire and stop. This is the record.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 311

— Ye Jingfeng

"Yes, Captain," Zheng Yan's spirit brightened, as if he had found something. "I don't dare to ask the captain, isn't this time coming south with a very important mission?"

"Yes!"

"But to start work?" Zheng Yan was a little hesitant; because this was the superior's secret.

"Yes to starting the work of starting work... Miss Pingzi and I have other things to cooperate on."

"If the subordinate could know a little bit about the content... That is to say, perhaps I can think of a little bit about the content of the cooperation between the captain and Ping... Miss Nakamura; the meaning of 'observers are clear'..."

"That's right..." Just as Hejian was about to tell Zheng Yan about the secret mission, the maid appeared again.

"The car that the young lady was sitting in has now been found out; it is parked inside the garage. But that driver already went off duty and went home at half past ten; he will go on duty at four in the afternoon. Our manager here, because the master specified that he wanted this driver, asked the garage manager to find a way, and the manager promised to send someone to the driver's house to ask him to work overtime. At the latest, he can drive here by twelve o'clock. The manager said, please forgive the master, he didn't handle things well enough."

"Oh, very good, very good. Please thank the manager for me, I'm so sorry to trouble him. Anyway, it's already... Hejian looked at his watch, "It's already past eleven, we can wait until twelve o'clock... Please bring a few bottles of beer and some food..." Hejian spoke to the maid with a bit too much politeness.

In ten minutes, Zheng Yan was still holding that strange note and that letter, studying them carefully. Hejian had already taken off his kimono and put on casual clothes, still that summer suit. The beer and food he wanted were neatly placed on the table. The maid originally wanted to serve in the room, but Hejian said, "There's no need," and sent the maid out.

These two young people, because they work abroad, are already used to sitting habits and are not used to kneeling anymore. They sat around the small square table, eating and drinking, and talking closely.

First, Hejian told Zheng Yan very carefully about the secret of coming south this time; and explained the importance of the time factor! "Today is the 30th, and half a day has already passed, and things must be done effectively before sunset tomorrow!"! At the same time, he also explained that Pingzi did not announce any methods; "I am passive;" Judging from Pingzi's tone, even she herself still didn't know.

"I think the key to everything is probably in this letter." Hejian pointed to the official document sent by the embassy. "I plan to open this letter at the latest by four o'clock in the afternoon if Pingzi hasn't come back." Hejian carefully hid the letter in his luggage.

"Yes, for the sake of big things, of course, these small details can't be taken into account." Zheng Yan pointed to Hejian's view of personality that he was about to read other people's letters. "Does the captain need my friend to participate?" Zheng Yan proposed his friend for the second time.

"This is exactly what I'm eager to find out." Hejian expressed his opinion with extreme sincerity.

So Zheng Yan explained what he knew about this friend. …

### Tokyo Romance

— Mei Bai

Fat and twenty-nine-year-old Earnest Hoberecht, director of the Associated Press Tokyo branch, is now the most popular writer in Japan.

Hoberecht became famous for "one thing," and that "one thing" earned him $80,000!

Here's how it happened. One day, he went to the Shochiku film studio in Japan to cover a news story. When he arrived, the Japanese actress Hideko Mimura was pouting at the company executives, demanding a rewrite of the script—because the script required her to perform a kissing scene, and Miss Mimura, at the age of twenty-six, had never experienced kissing.

Seeing an opportunity, Hoberecht immediately told Miss Mimura and many company employees nearby: General MacArthur had stated that kissing scenes in movies could help promote the spirit of democracy. Then, he told the beautiful Mimura that he was willing to teach her how to perform a kiss.

As a result, he decisively carried out his mission to promote democracy—he kissed her.

Miss Mimura seemed a little dizzy. After a moment, she suddenly turned around and ran to the dressing room.

A tea server brought out a note written by Miss Mimura. The note was for Hoberecht, and she wrote: "Since today's event has occurred, I hope we never meet again."

The development of the matter did not seem to be what Hoberecht had anticipated. However, Hoberecht unexpectedly had good luck that he had never anticipated. It turned out that his "democratic education" had become a "legend" throughout Japan, and all Japanese newspapers reported on this major event!

Hoberecht became a well-known celebrity throughout Japan, and bookstores contacted him for manuscripts, and magazine editors asked him to write articles. As a result, two months later, Hoberecht's first novel, "Tokyo Romance," was published. The book was immediately translated into Japanese, with an initial printing of 100,000 copies, which sold out in less than two weeks, becoming the first best-selling book in Japan after the war. The main story of the novel is about how an American reporter pursues a Japanese actress and finally wins her over. Hoberecht himself admitted that the male protagonist in the book is actually himself.

"Tokyo Romance" earned him 1.2 million yen, which, according to the U.S. military exchange rate, is equivalent to about $80,000. Hoberecht's literary inspiration surged, and new books were published one after another: "Tokyo Diary," "Fifty Famous Americans," "Democratic Etiquette,"... each one selling well. Now, he is an Associated Press reporter from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., covering news and sending telegrams. After 5:30 p.m., he appears as a great writer: writing, writing, constantly writing.

### Filled with Primitive Spirit and Despising Chinese-Style Life – One Aspect of the Japanese National Character

— Chuang

Some time ago, I accidentally found an English translation of a book titled "Chinese People," edited and printed by the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, on a street book stall. It seemed to be for propaganda abroad during the war. Unfortunately, there were too many missing pages, so I didn't buy it. However, there were many very interesting materials in it: for example, they often expressed surprise and incomprehension about our Chinese-style life, especially the two things of eating and bathing, which were so wasteful and unhygienic. In fact, this criticism precisely illustrates the stubbornness of the Japanese nation in terms of wisdom. We Chinese emphasize seasoning in our meals, considering healthy eating as happiness, but the Japanese have fixed dishes of only two slices of salted radish and a few small fish, and the amount of rice is restricted, saying that it is suitable for nutrition and beneficial to digestion. Bathing is also the same. A square wooden box filled with hot water allows a family to soak in it in order for half an hour, which seems very civilized, but the elderly and young can face each other naked at this time, which is full of a primitive barbaric atmosphere. This is not more elegant than our daily use of the bathroom, and able to rub a lot of dirt from our bodies (which the original book was amazed at). As for wearing "kimonos" and sleeping on "tatami mats," which others consider to have no aesthetic appeal or comfort, they insist on emphasizing self-affirmation and praise, and never even consider reforming and evolving these things. This is the Japanese national character.

### Geishas in Decline

— Mou Ning

The geisha system, which the Japanese consider the most interesting and famous, and the geishas with their faces covered in powder within that system, are likely to become historical terms in the near future.

Before this so-called interesting system enters the history museum, it is not without interest to talk about the current situation of geishas. Currently, the cost of living in Japan is quite high, and it is not easy to make a living through so-called charm and skill, and geishas are no exception. Their average income is only 5,000 yen per month. This small amount is already quite stretched to cover food and clothing expenses. The kimonos they usually wear are mostly bought from the black market, and each one costs at least 3,000 yen; in other words, it takes one-sixth of all their hard-earned money. Heavy makeup is simply a capital investment in their habits. Without this capital, they cannot do business, so they still have to find ways to buy cosmetics and wigs for makeup, even though they are out of stock in the black market, and prices are rising again and again, frighteningly expensive. It can be seen that the life of selling smiles is just a hard and difficult job in Japan.

The difficulty of selling smiles did not begin today. It may as well be traced back to after the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident. At that time, Japanese militarists had already restricted the life enjoyment of the military and civilians in order to "economize on manpower and material resources." Most geisha houses were sacrificed as a result and "closed down." Later, American B-29s launched large-scale air raids on Tokyo, and the prosperous areas where geishas gathered bore the brunt and were razed to the ground one after another. Seeing that the situation was not right, the geishas successively changed their careers, or even declared themselves unemployed and returned to their hometowns to eat old rice.

Afterwards, the U.S. military occupied Japan, and there was a period of abnormal prosperity after the war. Japanese businessmen and officials, tired of work, were rich and had no way to vent their frustrations, so they happily threw themselves into the arms of geishas, trying to eliminate their own worries, listening to songs and buying laughter, seeking pleasure and dispelling sorrows, spending thousands of dollars without any stinginess. The U.S. military was fascinated by the exotic atmosphere and, in order to satisfy the geishas' curiosity and win their favor, used a large amount of U.S. dollars as "donations."

Those who laugh laugh, and those who cry cry. The Geisha Association (a labor union organized by the geishas themselves) believed that the U.S. military and geishas were mixing too intimately, which seemed to be detrimental to public image, so they established a convention: they were only allowed to entertain the U.S. military in restaurants, and not in any rooms other than restaurants, and were not allowed to show flirtatious behavior. Since then, the U.S. military has no longer been "guests behind the screen," but only "visitors" in geisha houses. Note: The word "visitor" is borrowed from the Japanese geishas' other name for the U.S. military; it is not a name created by the author alone.

During the war, the area around Tokyo developed to about 10,000 geishas, but now only one-tenth remains, and it is still gradually decreasing.

Now, General MacArthur's order to liberate the geishas has been issued, which is tantamount to firing a cannon at the owners of brothels. Although geishas are still making money and living their lives today under the conditions of democratic prosperity, this kind of life is ultimately limited. If General MacArthur's directive can truly eliminate the geisha system, then the liberated housewives of Japan will follow in the footsteps of the geishas and take on their traditional hospitality work.

### Racing Against Japan

— Ma Qi

While we are in the midst of a deep economic crisis, we see news reports that several countries have expressed their willingness to resume international trade with Japan. After thinking about it, I can't help but feel a lot of emotions.

Japan has recovered so quickly! It has only been a year and a half since the surrender, and it has already recovered its vitality. The embarrassing situation of defeat is no longer seen today; the country is peaceful and the people are happy, and foreign countries are naturally happy to rebuild economic relations. This is undoubtedly a sign of Japan's post-war rebirth.

Looking back to the eve of victory, all countries confirmed that China would become the most stable force in Asia after the war, and the prosperity and development of Asia's economic life would inevitably begin and be driven by China. Who knew that to this day, China is still plagued by wars, full of dangers, and unable to take care of itself, let alone lead Asian countries to prosperity together? Without a stable economic life in the country, normal international trade is naturally impossible to talk about. Therefore, we cannot even receive the "favor" that Japan, which we defeated, has received, which is truly not enough to grieve for ourselves.

There is no need to envy Japan, and there is no need to be afraid. We have already worked hard to defeat Japan's aggression in the past, so the future lives of the Japanese people need to be helped to improve. Based on the principle of establishing oneself and establishing others, we should play a role in transforming Japan. The problem is that we need to move forward vigorously, otherwise, if we fall behind the Japanese, we will have no face to show.

### Japanese Troops Still Resisting

— Wei Rong

A United Press report from Pearl Harbor said that in the caves of Peleliu Island in the Pacific Ocean, there are still a small number of Japanese troops hiding inside, resisting the U.S. Marine Corps' mopping-up operations. These Japanese troops still believe that the U.S. military has only occupied "Palaus," and that Japan as a whole is still fighting. This news makes us feel the vastness of the Pacific theater of operations and the prevalence of barren mountains and fields. At the same time, it also makes us laugh; it is just as laughable as suddenly seeing someone still wearing a queue and calling the Qing Emperor after the Republic of China has been established for decades, waiting day and night for the restoration.

This matter is naturally not a laughing matter for the Japanese troops themselves. Not only do they not find it funny, but even the Japanese government and people, despite seemingly having come to a great realization under General MacArthur's supervision, would not find it funny. In their minds, they must still regard these resistant elements as heroes. Because this kind of resistance mentality does not only exist in the resistant elements in the caves, but is also latent in the blood of most Japanese people. When they see this news, they will feel resonance emotionally, not laughter.

And the U.S. Marine Corps engaged in the mopping-up operations probably also have no possibility of laughing. The Japanese troops are hiding in the caves, launching surprise attacks at any time, and can occasionally pose a threat to security and life. The Marine Corps has not seen the enemy surrender on this false island, and the state of war still exists. While they are engaged in mopping-up operations, they must also be quite vigilant. This mood is naturally not easy.

The only ones who probably find it funny are us who think the world is already peaceful and are "completely settled" and planning to enjoy peace, just as we are indifferent when the four major enemies of "poverty," "illness," "ignorance," and "selfishness" are still rampant. Just as we are reveling in the glory of being one of the four powers when feudal remnants and warlord remnants are still disrupting order and destroying security.

### Traditional Japanese Humanity

— Fang Tian

The Japanese nation has diligently imitated the West in science, and the same is true for the arts, except for musicals, which are very strange. They have accepted any new type of design and expression in Western song and dance, but they have exclusively abandoned the sexually explicit "hip-swinging dance" (i.e., things like the ordinary so-called "hula dance"). Their reason is very simple: this dance is originally a very primitive expression of sexual behavior by indigenous peoples, which is obscene and cruel, and humans should not and cannot make it public; therefore, the Japanese can allow women's bodies to be exposed without concealment in public bathhouses, and can allow men to obtain sexual gratification under various conveniences, but they always deny the legitimate right of ordinary geisha dancers to take off their "kimonos" and change into bras and panties. Their obscenity is idealistic, and their cruelty is latent. From this, we can once again discover the stubbornness and incompetence of the Japanese nation's thinking.

Although the above facts are simple, they are indeed the eternity of the Japanese national character. In Japanese history, we can especially see constant records of those "heroic patriots" giving up their lives and even the fate of the country to maintain this eternity. Now the day of testing has arrived. Isn't Lire often publishing: Japanese men are secretly demanding democracy, and Japanese women are also proud to be close to American soldiers? But can the truth of their humanity, the goodness of their feelings, buried in the tradition, be liberated from now on? We look forward to the answer from the facts! (Japanese National Character II)

### "Eighty-Three Years Wrong"

— Mustard Seed

Confession of an Old Japanese Writer

The arrest warrants for a large number of Japanese war criminals, like a thunderstorm, struck the heads of fifty-nine people who were like remnant leaves. Japanese militarists, politicians, financial tycoons, and literary magnates are all trembling for their own fate. At that time, the old writer Tokutomi Sohō (also known as Roka, eighty-three years old), who was once famous for his play "Hototogisu," was recuperating from his chronic illness in his cottage in Izusan, Atami. Hearing this thunderbolt, he suddenly picked up his pen and entrusted his feelings of remorse and repentance in a twenty-character five-character quatrain, which also overflowed between the lines. The poem is as follows:

"For whom do blood and tears flow? A loyal heart violates old age.

The vicissitudes of life change in an instant, eighty-three years wrong!"

### Cherry Blossoms

— Luo Qi

The color and shape of cherry blossoms are very similar to peach blossoms, and you can't see the leaves when they first bloom, so they are also like plum blossoms. When cherry blossoms are in full bloom, it is also when people are intoxicated by the spring scenery. Japan often regards cherry blossoms as the national flower, comparing their sudden and dazzling bloom for a while and then their sudden withering to temporary success. However, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek also wrote this about samurai, whose lives are short: "The flowers are cherry blossoms, and the people are samurai. How beautiful, but also too tragic." Japan is indeed a nation that loves cherry blossoms, and there is an annual cherry blossom festival that is celebrated nationwide.

In the impression of foreigners, in addition to feeling some pessimistic sentiment, what is even more interesting is that many people say that cherry blossoms fully represent the character of the Japanese people and also represent the goods produced in Japan, which are beautiful to look at but not durable, like the women on the Japanese islands, who are beautiful and graceful when they are young, but become bloated and ugly after a few years. Cherry blossoms also symbolize the fate of Japan, which rises suddenly but is difficult to prosper for a long time.

Cherry blossoms have a special preference in the minds of the Japanese people, and now "the world has changed and time has passed." When the cherry blossoms are about to bloom again, I wonder what the people of the island nation of Fusang will think.

### Three "Magic Weapons" - Exposing the Tricks of the Eastern Mirror

— Mo Lang

The "Eastern Mirror" was finally exposed in the epoch-making war. Japan, which calls itself the "Land of the Gods," can be said to be second to none in the world in its degree of superstition, but in reality, it is more accurate to say that it worships things rather than gods. Divine power, imperial power, and property rights are simply the same thing, with only three different names. When the Japanese emperor ascends the throne, it is said that he must rely on sacred objects in addition to relying on the divine body. The so-called sacred objects are the three magic weapons: the first is a mirror said to be able to illuminate and kill enemies, hidden in a white satin black box, which even the Japanese emperor himself is not allowed to open and look at; the second is a necklace made of gemstones similar to our country's rosary; and the third is a treasure sword that was lost in ancient Japanese wars.

These three magic weapons are buried in the shrine, and they are always kept intact. Each generation of Japanese emperors has to carry counterfeit mirrors, necklaces, and treasure swords to ascend the throne. The common people do not know the truth and actually respect them as emperors as if they were real, and at the same time believe that the counterfeit things are real. Do you think that the Eastern Mirror has been exposed, hasn't it become a fake magic weapon and a fake emperor?

### Happy Japanese Children

— Li Shui

After reading the impressions of Japan published by the reporters who were invited by General MacArthur to visit Japan this time, I deeply rejoice that the Japanese children are happy. Compared with the children of China, which is called one of the five leading powers in the world, it is truly extremely embarrassing.

First, although the clothes of Japanese children are not luxurious, they are all clean.

Second, although Japan is facing a rice shortage, adults can save on food and are willing to go hungry themselves, but children must be fed as much as possible, so the elementary school students everywhere are all fat and cute.

Third, the Japanese Diet has passed a bill to extend compulsory education from six years to nine years, which means that from now on, Japanese children, regardless of gender, poverty, or wealth, can receive an education equivalent to our junior high school graduation.

Japanese children do not have to worry about clothing, food, or education. They have all the happiness that children should have. Looking back at our Chinese children, how can we not feel lost and sigh!

### Japan's New Rich

— Xi

In Japan today, countless ordinary citizens are still struggling to make a living with limited rations, while the new rich spend money like water in Tokyo restaurants every night, leading a life of extravagance and debauchery.

These new rich mostly have large amounts of unfrozen cash. According to statistics from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, they frequent more than 24,280 restaurants and entertainment venues. These money pits are often located on the ruins of broken walls and adjacent to the slums of starving and freezing people, with a feeling of "the smell of wine and meat rots within the vermillion gates, and there are frozen corpses on the road."

From the conversations of the owners of these entertainment venues, one can imagine how generous these guests are. They often reward maids and dancers with huge sums of money without any stinginess.

An old owner said: "Our customers are not the middle-class people from the upper class as they used to be, but they have a lot of money, and we have to cater to their tastes in order to maintain our business."

According to the official price estimates of the police department, the total amount of goods spent in entertainment venues every night is 16,313,700 yen. However, since most of the alcoholic beverages and dishes are purchased from the black market, the actual amount is several times this number. As for the "tips" that these rich customers give to maids and dancers every night, they average more than 10,000 yen.

It is said that most of these upstarts are large hoarders of daily necessities who obtain huge profits by selling their hoarded goods.

### Starting from the Japanese Emperor's New Poem

— Chen Jiahua

Not long ago, the Japanese Emperor Showa wrote a new poem, which is said to have been written in response to a poetry recital held in the Imperial Palace.

"People will love the pine trees that resemble people,

Whose green color does not change under the great snow-"

The above two lines are the words in his poem. This kind of beautiful and pure color has led many people to praise the artistic talent of the Japanese Emperor.

But this is a very superficial view.

Naturally, if we appreciate this short poem from an artistic point of view, the author's literary attainments, at least the success of this poem, are ultimately worthy of admiration.

Literature is a symbol of depression, especially poetry, which is "the language of skill saturated with emotion" (Ai Qing). Therefore, if we study this new poem from this point of view, we will find that this is the Japanese Emperor's heartfelt voice, containing educational and warning implications, and should never be appreciated as a "poem."

The Japanese nation has a barbaric and cunning character. The strong Yamato nation is what they are proud of. Although they have now been defeated in the war, the simple-minded "subjects" have not yet given up their dream of a great empire.

Some people have long said that the way the Japanese are now so obedient to General MacArthur is just a way to adapt to the environment!

In this way, if we look at the new poem written by the Japanese Emperor from this perspective, there is no doubt that we will understand that this is a declaration of resistance by the Japanese Emperor. In this poem, the Japanese Emperor clearly compares himself to a pine tree. His meaning is: although Japan (the Emperor) is under oppression, it will not yield.

Japan has not been tamed. The so-called "democracy" is just a kind of decoration in their politics, a deception and response to the Allied countries. The brutal Japanese warlords have not reduced their strength, are lurking, and are eager to try! And they are already preparing to restore the "Great Japanese Empire."

Do you believe that the Shibuya Incident and the flags on the Huangpu River have no political conspiracy?
