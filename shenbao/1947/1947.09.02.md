### The Far Eastern Situation Becomes Increasingly Urgent; the U.S. Will Revise Its China Policy; Foreign Minister Wang to Fly to New York on the 6th to Attend the UN General Assembly; China Decides to Participate in Discussions on the Korean Issue

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] Wang Shijie, Foreign Minister and Chief Representative of China's Delegation to the Second United Nations General Assembly, is scheduled to fly to New York from Shanghai on a Pan American Airways jumbo jet on the 6th. He will be accompanied by Hu Yu, Director of the Treaty Department, and Zhang Changlu, Director of the Information Department. It is reported that in addition to attending the Second UN General Assembly, Wang will also make contact with key figures from various countries regarding the Korean and Japanese issues.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a reply to the U.S. Embassy in China on the morning of the 1st, expressing its agreement to the U.S. government's invitation to participate in discussions regarding the Korean issue.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st Consolidated Dispatch] Diplomatic officials here generally believe that the next four months will be the most important period in history concerning Far Eastern affairs. They point out that the decisions made during this period will shape the long-term trends of matters in the region. Japan, Korea, and China will all be countries of great concern during this historically turbulent period. Indonesia, Vietnam, and India will also receive equal attention. The initial discussions among the Allied nations regarding a peace treaty with Japan, "possibly to be held in September," will be the preliminary procedure for the victorious Allied nations to transform Japan's domestic future. These discussions will also reveal whether cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Far East is still possible. If the Soviet Union insists that only the four major powers—Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union—should participate in drafting the peace treaty with Japan, the other nine member states of the Far Eastern Commission will proceed with discussions regardless of the Soviet Union. These officials point out that while they are reluctant to openly break with the Soviet Union, the urgency of the current situation is such that all nations that participated in the war against Japan would rather abandon cooperation with the Soviet Union if necessary. Considering the current general views and policies of the United States, the Korean issue is expected to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly this fall. Sources here believe that the U.S.'s abandonment of seeking an agreement with the Soviet Union on the unification of Korea and its alternative proposal to convene a four-power conference in Washington on October 8 to discuss the issue is merely another step toward the United Nations, as it is impossible for the four powers to reach an agreement when the U.S. and the Soviet Union have failed to do so. Official sources believe that the U.S.'s proposal to convene a four-power conference is just another step in its diplomatic strategy, aiming to explore all possible solutions to the Korean stalemate before submitting it to the United Nations for resolution. As for the China issue, China will receive a response regarding its request for increased U.S. economic aid within the next eight weeks. The Wedemeyer Mission is expected to return to Washington in mid-September. Well-informed sources unanimously believe that the U.S.'s China policy will be revised in October. Regarding the Indonesian issue, diplomatic figures and government officials here express considerable doubt regarding the Security Council's ability to achieve a reconciliation on the issue. Most U.S. officials believe that Indonesia's rejection of U.S. mediation was a mistake, as they not only lost the opportunity for sympathetic mediation but also caused U.S. officials to seek to strengthen the position of Western nations instead.

### U.S. Generals Confer in Japan on Pacific Air Force Strategy; B-50 Bombers to Appear Soon

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] The Pacific Air Force strategy conference between MacArthur and senior U.S. Air Force officers continued on the 1st. Speculation is rife that their discussions are intended to exert diplomatic pressure on U.S.-Soviet relations. General Kenney, Commander of the U.S. Strategic Air Command, arrived here on the 31st to investigate global air force facilities and immediately held a meeting with MacArthur. Lieutenant General Whitehead, Commander of the U.S. Far East Air Forces, and Lieutenant General Eaker, Commander of the Fifth Air Force, also arrived here from the Philippines and held secret talks with the other two military leaders. According to well-informed military sources, the U.S. Air Force has encountered many difficulties in its flight tests in the Pan-Arctic region, and the results have made it necessary to revise U.S. strategy while also considering other air routes connecting Europe, Asia, and the United States.

The increasingly tense situation in China and the conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over the independence of Korea are two reasons why the U.S. is paying renewed attention to the strength of the Pacific Air Force. Observers experienced in Eastern affairs say that the U.S.'s prestige in the East depends heavily on its military strength, which must be sufficient to cope with emergencies. The U.S. Air Force has long intended to establish strategic air bases for its B-29s in Japan, the Philippines, Guam, Guadalcanal, and Okinawa.

Britain also plans to expand its air force facilities in Singapore, building a 19,000-foot air force runway sufficient for the largest bombers. Before arriving in the Philippines, Kenney had already held consultations with Royal Air Force leaders in London. The presence of U.S. bombers at this major airfield would enable the U.S. to spread its air power in East Asia. Once there is an emergency, these aircraft could quickly fly to Chengdu in the interior of China, where the U.S. built airfields during the war, allowing U.S. aircraft to control the heart of Central Asia. According to U.S. Air Force officials, the B-29 will soon be replaced by the B-50, a greatly improved aircraft nearly twice as heavy as the wartime heavy bomber.

It is reported that the U.S. Strategic Air Command is currently organizing a long-range fighter squadron, which plans to utilize the twin-fuselage Mustang P-82 with a range of 15,000 miles. This aircraft recently made a non-stop flight from Honolulu to the mainland. Air force experts say that this aircraft will become obsolete in five to seven years due to the emergence of new long-range jet bombers and fighters that are still in the testing stage. The Army Air Corps already has P-80 jet fighters stationed on various islands in the Western Pacific.

Statement by Spokesperson of the Democratic Socialist Party

[Our Newspaper Report] The Democratic Socialist Party convened a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday from 3:00 PM after Zhang Junmai returned to Shanghai, which ended around 6:00 PM. After the meeting, the party spokesperson stated: "Regarding the negotiations for the Nanjing general election, there have been no concrete results to date. The government hopes that the three parties will submit as many candidates as possible, and then the three parties will jointly form a review committee to exchange views and conduct the review work. Therefore, the list of candidates was not discussed at today's standing committee meeting. At the same time, some members of the Standing Committee, in view of the actual situation of the recent municipal council elections in Guangzhou and Beiping, have expressed negativity towards the party's participation in the general election." Regarding the issue of vacancies for government committee members in the party, it was also discussed at yesterday's meeting, and it was decided not to nominate candidates in the short term. In the future, it may still be held by representatives from overseas.

### Autumn Colors Deepening in Guling; President Takes Walks in the Mountains; Visited the Library with His Wife Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 1st Dispatch] The residents of Guling are encouraged and delighted by the arrival of President Chiang and his wife. After climbing the mountain on the 31st, Governor Wang Lingji of Jiangxi Province planned to prepare for a grand welcoming ceremony to be held on the 1st, requesting the President to give instructions, but the President expressed his unwillingness to be extravagant and thus the ceremony was cancelled. The celebration of the victory conference prepared by Director Wu of the Lushan Administration, which was scheduled to be held on the 3rd, will also be simplified. The President, accompanied by his wife, visited the Lushan Library, the Chuanshe School, and the Lushan Auditorium at 9:00 AM, and then returned to the official residence. In the afternoon, he and his wife took a stroll along Dalin Road from the Flower Path to the Immortal Cave, returning around 6:00 PM. When the President and his wife went out, they traveled by sedan chair. On the way back, his wife returned by sedan chair first, while the President got off the chair when he arrived at the Central School and inspected the streets on foot, inquiring about the details of the major fire this spring from Wu Shih-han, the director of the Lushan Administration, who accompanied him, before returning to the official residence to rest. The President wore a long robe and mandarin jacket today, with the duckbill cap he often wore in Guling last year. His wife wore a red velvet Western suit. The autumn colors in the mountains today are deep, and a thick fog fills the air, making it impossible to see people more than ten steps away. They did not go out in the evening, only briefly surveying the scenery from the grass, which made the mountain scenery feel particularly peaceful.

### Zhang Qun Comments on Wedemeyer's Statement: Wedemeyer Did Not Fully Understand Many Things; Some Reforms Must Await the Implementation of Constitutional Governance

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan stated in an exclusive interview with a United Press reporter on the 1st that the Chinese government would not change its domestic and foreign policies as a result of the Wedemeyer Mission's visit to China. Zhang also stated: "There are many things that General Wedemeyer did not know." During Wedemeyer's visit to China, he met with Wedemeyer many times, but Wedemeyer did not hold "important" meetings with him because Wedemeyer placed more emphasis on people outside the government than on government officials.

Zhang said that the reforms suggested in Wedemeyer's farewell statement had already been implemented by the government before his visit to China, but Wedemeyer believed that he was still very familiar with the situation in China soon after leaving the country. Many people wanted to meet with Special Envoy Wedemeyer but could not get the chance, so Wedemeyer did not learn about many things. Wedemeyer received a lot of help from his advisors, and perhaps Wedemeyer thought that the information was sufficient. He has a deep personal friendship with Wedemeyer and understands his good intentions, but the statement issued by Wedemeyer in his capacity as "Special Envoy of the President of the United States" has aroused much criticism among the Chinese people. He hoped that the general criticism would understand Wedemeyer's good intentions and that Wedemeyer would understand those who criticized his statement.

When asked, "Does Premier Zhang disagree with Wedemeyer's opinion that China must implement drastic and comprehensive political and economic reforms, as you said that China will not change its domestic and foreign policies as a result of the Wedemeyer mission's visit to China?" Zhang replied, "China has stipulated in the newly established constitution and future elections that these decisions will be implemented 'gradually'. Small matters should not be mixed with policy matters. This is a question of method. China's policy is fixed and does not intend to change its domestic or foreign policies."

"Our American friends say that the Chinese government is inefficient, and we are studying ways to improve it. We understand that we have learned a lot from the United States and Western countries, but implementing reforms in China will involve many things such as habits, systems, and procedures. But this does not mean that we do not intend to reform the current administration. We have many things to do now, but many things must wait."

"For example, we are well aware of the disadvantages of political tutelage, and we are ending it as soon as possible. But it is not appropriate to end political tutelage before the implementation of the constitution. Many similar reforms must wait until after the constitution is implemented."

Zhang also stated that since the government was reorganized, the government's responsibilities have become greater and the work has become more arduous, and the main task is to concentrate all efforts to guide the implementation of constitutional governance.

Although there are many obstacles, the government is determined to complete this task this year. Many people doubt whether the government really intends to hold the general election this autumn and believe that the general election will be postponed due to the civil war.

Zhang continued, "Our policy is to hold the general election, and the government will ignore all obstacles and will not change its policy."

Zhang also mentioned the criticism from "American friends" about the import and export regulations, which are most troubling to merchants, saying that the government feels that there has been progress in this matter, but foreign criticism cannot cause these regulations to be changed overnight.

Zhang concluded that the Chinese government's views on the Wedemeyer Mission had been conveyed to Wedemeyer several days before the Wedemeyer Mission left China. This can represent his personal opinions and the opinions of the Chinese government.

### Content of China's Draft Peace Treaty with Japan Consists of Five Major Parts and Over 120 Articles

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] China's drafting of a peace treaty with Japan has reached its final stage. Except for some outstanding issues related to reparations and other technical aspects, the draft treaty is largely complete. It will be reviewed and supplemented by the Peace Treaty with Japan Review Committee in the shortest possible time, and after discussion by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, it will be submitted to the authorities and central core meetings for final confirmation to serve as China's concrete proposals at the peace conference with Japan.

The initial draft of the peace treaty was completed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Peace Treaty with Japan Drafting Committee last year and has been revised twice to date. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches great importance to this matter and has completed this important work with the highest efficiency and utmost thoroughness over the past two years. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has kept the content of the draft strictly confidential and refuses to publish it. However, according to the reporter's inquiries from various authoritative sources over the past month, based on the requirements of general treaties, the draft treaty is divided into five major parts, with more than 120 articles, and several appendices providing technical details on specific issues. The main points are summarized as follows:

(1) Preamble: Explains the significance of the treaty, which is to complete the legal end of the war, completely eliminate Japan's aggressive capabilities, and rebuild peace in the Far East and the world.

(2) Territorial Clauses: Generally based on the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement, and with reference to the Japanese Administrative Area Management Plan (drafted by the Allied Headquarters for the Occupation of Japan). Japan's territory will be limited to its four main islands and the surrounding small islands. The status of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Korea, Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the three trust territories of Micronesia will all have specific provisions.

(3) Political Clauses: Japan's aggressive ideology, spirit, and political system must be completely eliminated. The content of textbooks for national education and re-education must be strictly reviewed to stop the inculcation of aggressive ideas. Social groups with militaristic spirits such as Bushido and the Black Dragon Society must be eradicated. The financial cliques that constitute the strength of aggression must be reformed and subject to control. Political reforms towards democracy must be implemented effectively.

(4) Reparations Clauses: The subject of Japanese reparations includes industrial production equipment and manufactured goods. The industries that it may retain are limited to civil industries that directly or indirectly cannot create aggressive forces. The living standards of the people should be given the lowest possible estimate based on the current situation. Reparations must be fully implemented. The amount of reparations that China should receive should be at least 40% or more. All public and private loans and construction assets made by Japan overseas for the purpose of aggression, such as the Nishihara Loans and the construction in the areas it once occupied, shall be unconditionally abolished or confiscated.

(5) Military Clauses: Japan's military equipment must be completely dismantled, and it must not retain any land, sea, or air military forces, or any directly or indirectly related military industries. Domestic order in Japan will be maintained by the police, who may only be equipped with small arms, and the import of firearms will also be limited according to specific needs. After the signing of the treaty, a control committee will be organized by the main Allied countries, and military occupation and civil supervision will continue simultaneously, for a period until the treaty is fully implemented and democracy replaces aggression. The expenses will be borne by Japan.

The most important of the appendices are the provisions for the implementation of the territorial clauses, the procedures for reparations and the technical provisions for the disposal of reparations goods, the provisions for the clearing of overseas assets, and the provisions for the organization and tasks of the control committee.

According to authoritative sources, the main principle adopted by China for the peace treaty with Japan is to eradicate all factors related to aggression while still giving its people the opportunity to live in peace and democracy. The entire draft treaty is based on this principle. China has suffered the most from Japan for the longest time and has the deepest understanding of Japan, and in the future, it will not want to suffer from it again. Therefore, the purpose of all proposals is to make Japan completely abandon aggression and strive to become a new democratic and peaceful country, re-enter the international community, and contribute to the peace of the Far East and the world to atone for its past sins.

### Commemorating the September 3rd Victory; Exhibition of Received Japanese Warships; National Army in Changchun Prepares for a Grand Parade

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] According to military sources, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the September 3rd Victory Day, the Naval Headquarters has decided to publicly exhibit a Japanese warship received by China through the Allied allocation at the Xiaguan Naval Dock on that day. The ship is tentatively named "Jie 6" (Reception 6) and was the first to be received on July 6th. Originally named "Haibō 194," it was built by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding in Nagasaki and launched in 1945. After its completion, the ship departed from Sasebo in July of the same year to escort merchant ships, but was attacked by U.S. Air Force en route to Vladivostok and narrowly avoided being sunk. After the end of the war, it was disarmed.

### Communist Bandits Plunder Grain to Exchange for Military Supplies with a Certain Party

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 1st Dispatch] Since occupying eastern territories, the Communist bandits have been plundering food from the people. Recently, they established the Northeast Trading Company in Dantuqian (on the border of Xingkai Lake) in Mishan County, Heilongjiang Province, to exchange grain plundered from various places for military supplies with a certain party.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 1st Dispatch] Yang Xiufeng, "Chairman" of the Communist Bandit Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, was ordered to strictly order all agencies to convene the masses on the 20th to initiate a voluntary donation campaign. Compatriots with even a small amount of property in the Jinnan-Taihang Bandit Area feel uneasy under their coercion. According to bandit propaganda, all the donations will be used to purchase aircraft and new weapons from a certain country to continue their policy of harming the country and people. Furthermore, it is learned that the Bandit Ji-Lu-Yu region has launched a "bloody struggle" again, and those with assets and so-called "fugitives" are not spared. Near the Nanshuiye town of Cixian County, an average of 60 people were killed in each village. In addition, the Bandit Ding County Government recently convened a mass meeting and executed more than 100 people who welcomed the National Army to vent their anger.

### The Exchange Rate of the Japanese Yen to the U.S. Dollar Is Rumored to Be Adjusted Again Soon

[Reuters, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] Well-informed sources say that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar will soon be adjusted to 130 yen per U.S. dollar. Before the outbreak of the war, the exchange rate was 4 yen to 1 U.S. dollar. When the Allied forces entered after the war, the Allied forces set the unofficial exchange rate for U.S. dollars to Japanese yen at 15 yen to 1 U.S. dollar. After the British and American occupation authorities issued military scrip to curb black market activities, the yen exchange rate was adjusted to 50 yen to 1 U.S. dollar. The Japanese Economic Newspaper magazine estimated in July this year that the true value of the yen in Tokyo should have been 148 yen to 1 U.S. dollar at that time, and the black market price was between 100 and 150 yen.

### Churchill Should Be Held Responsible for the Difficulties China Has Encountered in the Northeast; Strategic Blunders Created Today's Stalemate

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] Today, two years after the signing of the Yalta Agreement, some Chinese claim that Churchill should bear the greatest responsibility for the difficulties the Chinese government has encountered in the Northeast. Previously, President Roosevelt was regarded as bearing the main responsibility, but now many Chinese historians accuse Churchill of being the great culprit. The reason is that Churchill opposed opening a second front in 1943. If the second front had been opened in 1943 according to Roosevelt's plan, the Soviet Union might not have participated in the war against Japan, or even if the Soviet Union had participated, at least the price should have been lower. In the spring of 1945, Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill signed the Yalta Agreement, purchasing Soviet participation in the war against Japan. This agreement forced China to transfer some of Imperial Russia's privileges in China to the Soviet Union, such as joint management of the China Changchun Railway, Soviet use of Lushun Port as a naval base, and the lease of half of Dalian Port's facilities to the Soviet Union without compensation for 30 years. Chinese recall that the United States had drafted a plan to attack Europe by crossing the English Channel in 1943, and Churchill initially agreed to this plan, but suddenly suggested attacking North Africa and Italy first. Roosevelt agreed after Churchill guaranteed that he would attack Europe in 1944. Churchill's reason for attacking the Mediterranean and Balkan regions was purely a political strategy. Churchill's plan was a major strategic blunder, as Hitler only had 29 divisions in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in 1943, while he had 58 divisions in 1944. In addition, the German Sixth Army, which Churchill feared, had been defeated by the Soviet Union in 1943. Therefore, the conclusion is that if the second front had been opened in 1943, the war could have ended a year earlier, and the loss of manpower and resources could have been reduced. The United States would also have increased its confidence, manpower, and armament in the war against Japan. In this way, the Allies would not have had to "beg" the Soviet Union to participate in the war, and China would have already recovered the entire Northeast.

### Henan National Army Recaptures Gushi; Communist Bandits Flee Dabie Mountains; Martial Law Begins Tonight in Wuhan

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 1st] The focus of the war is gradually shifting south to the Dabie Mountain area on the border of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. The National Army pursuit and suppression corps recaptured Gushi at 2:00 PM on the 31st. The remnants of Liu's Third Column fled south to areas near Yejiaji and Lihuang, where the National Army is encircling and suppressing them. The National Army advancing east along the Pinghan Railway recovered Gangdian (southwest of Luoshan) on the morning of the 1st. The war situation has developed into a new stage, and the National Army is making new deployments.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 1st] The war in southern Henan has entered a pacification stage. The National Army has entered and garrisoned Shangcheng, and is conducting mopping-up operations in the Jingfu area.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 1st] Part of Liu's Third Column, which was trapped in Gushi, was completely annihilated by the National Army's fierce counterattack. The city was recovered by the National Army at noon on August 31st. After being fiercely attacked by the National Army moving south, the Second and Sixth Columns of bandits have been on the run for several days. When they arrived at Macheng County seat in the afternoon of August 31st, they did not dare to rest for a moment due to the rapid advance of the National Army from all directions. On the morning of the 1st, they harassed Songbu, but were again severely attacked head-on by the National Army moving north, and are now fleeing southeast of Songbu in a panic. The independent column of bandits that fled to Xuanhuadian suffered heavy casualties after being intercepted by the National Army. The remnants are now being encircled and annihilated in the area north of Xuanhuadian. A part of the independent brigade of bandits that fled to Zhutangdian fled to Jiuliguan at 1:00 PM on August 31st, attempting to join its main force, but has now been cut off.

[Our Hefei Dispatch, 1st] Part of the communist bandits fled from Shangcheng to Lihuang on the 30th. The situation is unclear.

[Central News Agency, Hankou Dispatch, 1st] After Liu Bocheng's communist bandit forces fled to Dabie Mountains, they could not hold their ground due to the National Army's urgent pursuit and were scattered and fleeing.

[Central News Agency, Hankou Dispatch, 1st] In order to ensure public security and prevent treacherous activities, the Wuhan Headquarters has ordered the responsible agencies to impose martial law every night from 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM, starting from the 2nd.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 1st] Chen Geng's bandit army, which attempted to aid Liu Bocheng, was blocked in the outer areas of Luoyang. In the battle of Hengshui, the bandits used forces more than double that of the National Army, launching round-the-clock attacks for a week, but failed. This fact is sufficient to show that their attempt to cross south has been shattered. At the same time, even if the communist bandits could approach Luoyang and carry out a siege, it would inevitably lead to a decisive battle, and all of Chen Geng's strength would inevitably be wiped out. The precarious situation of the communist bandits in western Henan is no less dangerous than that of Liu Bocheng's fleeing and defeated forces.

Naval Bombardment of Longkou; Communist Bandits in Shandong Suffer Heavy Losses

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] A Xuzhou telegram states: The government navy has begun to fiercely bombard Longkou, a key port in northern Shandong controlled by the communist bandits, located 60 miles west of Yantai.

[Associated Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Colonel Wang, a military spokesperson for the government, stated on the 1st: "The recent victories of the National Army in Shandong have shattered half of the communist army's strength in mainland China, marking a major turning point in the civil war." He also stated: "Due to the encirclement of the New Fourth Army in the Shandong war, the communist army's Jilu line from the Northeast has been sealed off. In terms of combat effectiveness and equipment, the National Army has now achieved half success south of the Great Wall." He revealed that at the peak of their power in Shandong after the end of World War II, the communist army controlled a total of 96 counties, but now only controls 53 counties, mostly in a narrow strip in northern Shandong bordering the Yellow River. South of the Jiaoji Railway, the communist army controls only two counties.

### Chen Cheng Flies from Nanjing to Shenyang; Takes Office as Director of the Northeast Headquarters Today; Xiong Shihui Bid Farewell to Subordinates Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] Chen Cheng, the concurrent Director of the Northeast Headquarters, is scheduled to officially take office at 10:00 AM on the 2nd. Xiong Shihui will personally hand over the office.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Chen Cheng left Nanjing at 9:50 AM on the 1st aboard the Chuiyun aircraft, flying to Pingquan to assume his new post. Minister Bai Chongxi and Vice Minister Qin Dechun of the Ministry of National Defense personally went to the airport to see him off. Accompanying him were Chu Xichun and more than ten other officers. Another attendant aircraft took off with them. Northeasterners Liu Zhe, Yu Bin, and Wang Guanwu also came to see him off. Chen briefly spoke with Minister Bai and shook hands with those seeing him off before boarding the plane and flying north. It is reported that Liu Muzeng, Director of the Judicial Department of the Ministry of National Defense, will be appointed as Chen's Chief Secretary.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] Chen Cheng flew from Nanjing to Shenyang at 2:10 PM on the 1st. Military and political leaders and representatives from all walks of life warmly welcomed him. As the Chuiyun aircraft landed, Xiong Shihui stepped forward to salute and shake hands. The leaders then exchanged pleasantries with him. Chen repeatedly said "Good," and "Thank you." After reviewing the honor guard, he went with Xiong in the same car to Xiong's residence for a meal. The handover ceremony between the new and old directors of the Northeast Headquarters has been scheduled for September 2nd. All sectors of Shenyang will hold a welcoming and farewell meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] Chu Xichun came with Chen Cheng and is rumored to be appointed to an important position in the Headquarters, possibly as Chief of Staff. Xu Liangxian has also been invited to Qing, rumored to be in charge of the reorganization and expansion of the cavalry in the Northeast.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] Xiong Shihui summoned the cadres of the Headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 1st to bid farewell, stating briefly: "The appointment of General Chen as the concurrent head of Northeast military and political affairs is a sign of the Central Government's emphasis on the Northeast. General Chen is skilled in military affairs. The Political and Economic Committees of the Headquarters will undergo changes, which will be determined by General Chen. His new position has not yet been decided. He plans to take a short rest." He encouraged his subordinates to work diligently under the leadership of the concurrent Director Chen. After the speech, he took a group photo with all the staff. Xiong held a cocktail party that evening to bid farewell to the press. It is rumored that Xiong will leave Shenyang within days.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] Deputy Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Zhao Jia talked about: The Communist bandits' long-proclaimed Sixth Offensive may be in early October, but who will strike whom is still undetermined. He implied that if the National Army's forces are well-supplied, they may take the offensive first.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 1st] Chen Mingren will come to inspect Changji. Currently, Changji is generally calm.

### Characters Jumping on the Red Stage in Warsaw (Continued from Yesterday) Fourth Letter from Poland

— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of this Newspaper

Afterwards, I didn't mention this matter to the International Propaganda Department. A few days before I left, our embassy even made a phone call for me. The reply was, "Mr. Gomulka is on summer vacation and may not be able to meet with reporters from your country." I was busy with visiting factories, schools, etc., and later forgot about it.

Gomulka is a communist member who started as a chemical worker. He is the most loyal "comrade" of the Kremlin. Because he was often arrested and imprisoned in the past, he understands the tricks of political struggle better than others. Many Poles say he is sinister and vicious, and some compare him to the Polish Vyshinsky. A friend from the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs told me: Gomulka is definitely not a person like史林. He also said: "Now the most powerful person in the Polish Communist Party is not Gomulka, but勃耳曼, because勃耳曼 controls Poland's '武般'!" "武般" is the Polish secret service. I don't know if this organization belongs to the Communist Party or the government? As a foreign journalist behind the Iron Curtain, it is really not appropriate to get to the bottom of things. I have never met勃耳曼. No one mentioned勃耳曼's name at the garden party at the Prime Minister's residence that day.

In addition to these people, there is also Industrial Minister闵斯 in the red circle in Poland, a communist member with a scholarly demeanor and a very meticulous mind. Some say: 闵斯 is Jewish, and some say his ancestors had Jewish blood!

During the five years of Nazi conquest of Poland, the Jews suffered the most tragic sacrifices. Hitler's henchmen killed Jews, often five hundred or a thousand at a time, mowing them down with machine guns. It was truly inhuman to the extreme. Now that Hitler has been defeated, the Jews have returned to Poland and have gained considerable "important positions." Under the freedom of speech in Poland, discussing the Jewish question is often restricted. I know that a special article about Jews in the Polish Peasant Party's "洛獨瓦" daily was confiscated.

I don't pay much attention to this issue, but I generally know that Poland once had 5 million Jews out of a population of 32 million before the war. The history between Jews and Poland could fill a special study. Generally speaking, the Polish economy before the war was controlled by the Jews. Many "summer resort" villas near Warsaw were almost all Jewish before the war. Now they have been changed into many "托兒所", "lung disease sanatoriums" and "children's hospitals", and so on.

There are no exact statistics on the number of Jews in Poland now, but roughly speaking, there are no more than 500,000 out of 23 million post-war Poles. The Polish government is now trying its best to eliminate the boundaries between Jews and non-Jews, and therefore does not want to reveal the Jewish issue in public opinion. During my stay in Warsaw, I attended a reception hosted by Jewish national leader Dr.史奈克. He had just returned from Palestine and was specially responsible for diplomatic work in the Soviet Union and behind the Iron Curtain. The most important central idea of Dr.史奈克's speech for more than an hour was to overthrow the rule of the British Empire in the Middle East and Near East!

The refreshments served that day were very generous. In addition to foreign and Polish journalists, there were also many Polish Jews捧塲. Dr.史奈克 gave his speech in Polish. The Polish International Propaganda Department specially sent a lady to translate for me, because everyone in the audience understood Polish, except me.

I am always grateful to the Warsaw authorities for their kindness to me. In my next communication, I will introduce them in particular. (The End)

### War Criminal Prison Established in Shanghai; To Be Completed by the End of This Month

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] According to the Military News Agency: In order to execute the sentences of war criminals who have already been convicted, the Ministry of National Defense will establish a war criminal prison in Shanghai. All war criminals who have been sentenced to imprisonment nationwide will be sent to this prison to serve their sentences. It is reported that the Ministry of National Defense has ordered Director Zou Renzhi of the Second Department to prepare in Shanghai, and it may be formally established by the end of this month to accommodate war criminals awaiting execution.

### Joint Meeting of Youth League Cadres and Supervisors Scheduled to Be Held in Guling; Unification of Party-State Organization to Be Completed Before May 5th Next Year

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The joint meeting of Youth League cadres and supervisors is scheduled to open on the 5th. The meeting is scheduled for three days and will be personally presided over by League Leader Chiang. Attendees will fly to Xunyang on the 4th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Regarding the implementation period of the unification of the Party-State organization, it is rumored that it will begin after the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, and the Youth League will be merged into the Party immediately. Therefore, some insiders believe that the recently convened joint meeting of the Party and League will be the last meeting to handle the end of League affairs. The reporter recently visited Xiang Chan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Ministry of the Youth League, to inquire about the implementation method. It is understood that the Central Government has determined that the unification of the Party-League organization does not mean merging the Party and League, nor does it mean mixing the Party and League, but rather having League members infiltrate the Party to create new revolutionary forces. This work process will require a considerable period of time and may be completed when the Seventh National Congress of the Kuomintang is opened. The date of the Seventh National Congress of the Kuomintang is around May 5th, 1937. Therefore, the completion of the unification of the Party-League organization will be before May 5th next year.

### Chen Jiageng Talks to Reporters in Singapore

[Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang of this Newspaper, Singapore Dispatch, 1st] The local overseas Chinese leader, Mr. Chen Jiageng, told the reporter group that passed through Shanghai to Singapore: "China hopes that a third party will emerge to call on the people and rebuild peace." Mr. Chen believes that this party must be growing, but he does not know who its leader is. Mr. Chen declined to criticize Chairman Chiang, but said that a leader of a country must be able to seek welfare for the people and be supported by the people. When Mr. Chen talked about the issue of overseas Chinese unity, he said: "If the situation in the country does not change one day, the ideological conflicts of the overseas Chinese will not stop one day. If China is united, the overseas Chinese will definitely support it as a whole." Mr. Chen declined to criticize the relative strength of the overseas Chinese leftists and rightists, but he believes that 80% of the overseas Chinese support China's democratization. Mr. Chen told reporters that he has not joined any party because he "can neither lead others nor wants to be led by others." He is not interested in the election of national representatives. He believes that only a few people are interested in this matter. Mr. Chen believes that China should adopt a policy that is neither pro-American nor pro-Soviet. "A country with a vast territory and a large population like China should have an independent foreign policy and should not be afraid of any country. The conquest of the world by force has passed!" He deeply regrets that the domestic situation in China prevents it from becoming the leader of the small countries in Asia and protecting them.

### China and Venezuela Strengthen Diplomatic Relations

That Country Decides to Open an Embassy in Beijing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] It is learned from diplomatic circles that the diplomatic relations between China and Venezuela will be strengthened. The Venezuelan government has decided to open an embassy in Nanjing and has appointed Fowler, the former Consul General in Shanghai, as Venezuela's Chargé d'affaires to China. He is expected to arrive in China around mid-September. Our government will not appoint a full-time ambassador to Venezuela, but will have Minister Yu Wangde in Colombia serve concurrently. Chen Zehua, a PhD, will be appointed as the First Secretary of the concurrent embassy in Venezuela, acting as the head of the embassy. It is reported that Chen, the chargé d'affaires, will soon embark on his journey to Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, to assume his new post.

### The Basic Problems of Basic Education in the Far East

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Far East Basic Education Conference is scheduled to open tomorrow in our nation's capital. The conference will last ten days, with a scheduled closing on the 12th. In addition to representatives from UNESCO, participants will include representatives from over ten countries, including China, India, Siam, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Bhutan, Nepal, Burma, Ceylon, and Malaya. This is truly a grand gathering for the academic and cultural circles of the Far East. In addition to extending a warm welcome to the representatives of various countries as the host nation, we would like to take this opportunity to examine some of the fundamental issues of basic education in the Far East, for the reference of the representatives of all countries.

Basic education is not a new endeavor. Since the dawn of humanity, there has been education. Education entails cultivating literacy and various ways of life in children and adults. Our nation's Six Arts education and the West's Three Aspects of Education are educations that aim toward this path. As the spokesperson for UNESCO stated, "The term 'basic education' is used to encompass both the concepts of children's education and adult education. It indicates that this type of education not only teaches people to read, write, and calculate, but also imparts some basic knowledge so that they can make a living, improve their economic situation, express themselves, improve their hygiene environment, and participate in domestic and international political activities, thereby guiding them toward a richer and more fulfilling life."

Preparations for this conference have taken three months. Our nation's experts have devoted themselves to preparing a "remarkable" set of materials. According to various reports, the materials they have planned include techniques and tools for language, writing, teaching, reading, and literacy training.

However, in our view, the basic problem of basic education in the Far East does not lie in technique, but in attitude; not in method, but in policy. If the attitude of outsiders toward the Far East is improved, and if the policies of outsiders toward the Far East are improved, the basic education of various countries in the Far East will be resolved without further effort. Owen Lattimore once said, "Americans have several obstacles to understanding the problems they need to understand. The biggest of these is our habit of putting Europe above all considerations. If we transfer political ideas to Africa and Asia, our habit is still to think from the European perspective." We fear that the Far East Basic Education Conference will also take Europe as its starting point and Europe as its center. If this erroneous attitude is committed, the obstacles to basic education in the Far East will be numerous.

The participants of the Far East Basic Education Conference include fifteen countries: China, Australia, India, Indonesia, Burma, Vietnam, Korea, Malaya, New Zealand, the Philippines, Siam, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Ceylon. Among these fifteen countries, with the exception of three or four, most are colonies, semi-colonies, or affiliated states awaiting liberation. Westerners are accustomed to calling them the "tropical Far East," which has a close relationship with Europe in many respects. During the conference, efforts must be made to avoid viewing the Far East through the eyes of Europeans and strive to view the Far East from the perspective of the Far East itself. If the political history and economic destiny of hundreds of millions of people in this Far East over the past centuries were not determined outside the Far East circle, basic education in the Far East would definitely not have the problems it has today.

The Far East is full of ancient civilizations, with brilliant early human cultures. History has proven that the people of the Far East are not inferior. Before the new era, that is, before Western powers extended their reach to the Far East, education in the Far East was widespread, was education for life, was education for culture, and had social, economic, and religious value. The American Far East expert, Furnivall, said, "Before the second half of the nineteenth century, the tropical Far East had schools, and the number of literate people was greater than in Europe at the same time."

Western politicians want to use education to transform Eastern society, but the transformation of society is not due to education, but due to economic forces, and this new society in turn transforms the quality of education. Large groups of people cannot come into contact with Western culture. Beneath the surface, the anger of resistance to the West is universally burning. As the wheel of time steps into the present, efficiency and social justice replace liberalism. At the same time, imperialism presents the phenomenon of the end of its strength. This tendency is reflected in colonial policy. The British publication of the "White Man's Burden" doctrine includes a new political philosophy and an ethical standard. Dutch colonial politicians advocated an "ethical" policy. French colonial doctrine replaced "assimilation" with "association." The new policy has changed the attitude towards education, viewing education as the main tool for economic progress and human welfare. In the early 20th century, the main aspects of the new education policy gradually formed. Its purpose is especially to develop basic education and vocational education, and to focus on women's education and adult education. It can be seen that before this new education was implemented, nationalism had already arisen. Nationalists viewed education very differently from the government. The government viewed education as economic rather than cultural; for survival rather than for life; teaching children how to make a living, but not teaching how to live, losing the value of education? In short, the basic problem of basic education in the Far East today does not lie in methods and techniques, but in attitudes and policies. If attitudes and policies are not improved, no matter how good the methods and techniques are, they will still be constrained and unable to make progress. It is hoped that the attending representatives will look at the basic education of this Far East with a broad perspective.

The ceremony was presided over by Deputy Director Xiao Yisu, who awarded graduation certificates. Subsequently, President Chiang's telegram was read aloud, and the ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM. President Chiang's original telegram stated that for the graduation of the 18th class of the branch academy and the training of demobilized military officers transferred to the police, as well as the opening ceremony of the 28th class of the regular course, it is hoped that the importance of police work in the process of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, and the great responsibility that the officers and students bear to the nation, will be explained to all students and trainees. Encourage them with the great righteousness of loyalty, diligence, impartiality, and integrity, promote the spirit of benevolence and love, and establish a vigorous school spirit, which is of utmost importance.

### Handling of Company Registration Cases by the Ministry of Economic Affairs

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that if a company registration case is found to involve foreign capital, and there are share ratio restrictions in its laws, the main agency (the agency implementing the law) will be consulted for proper handling. For example, the registration of shipping companies has always been handled after consulting the opinion of the Ministry of Communications. After a company is registered, if the registered items or reported documents are found to contain false information, the registration may be revoked according to legal procedures. Foreigners who use Chinese names to invest are also subject to legal sanctions. If the Ministry discovers such cases, it will take action to ban them at any time. Although the new Company Law does not restrict the share ratio of Sino-foreign joint ventures, other laws, if any, should still be followed.

### United Nations Investigating Committee Recommends Partition of Palestine: Report Submitted to the UN General Assembly

An external spokesperson stated that British officials would not express any opinion until the report was submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, and that the authorities would remain silent at least until they had received the full report and studied it.

During the transition period, Britain will continue to be responsible for the administration of Palestine under the auspices of the United Nations, and may be assisted by one or more member states of the United Nations. The proposal also stipulates that before the official recognition of the independence of the two countries, the two countries should sign a treaty establishing an economic alliance to ensure economic cooperation after independence. During the transition period, Britain should stipulate the same fixed amount each month, allowing 150,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine each month. If the transition period exceeds two years, the number of Jews immigrating each year should be set at 60,000. The organization of immigration is the responsibility of the Jewish Agency. The residents of the two countries should each elect a constitutional assembly. After the constitutional assembly is established, it should appoint a provisional government. The provisional government should issue a declaration guaranteeing basic freedoms, non-discrimination against minorities, and promising to sign an economic alliance treaty. After these procedures are completed, the country will be recognized as an independent sovereign state after the treaty is signed. If only one of the two countries completes these procedures, the United Nations General Assembly should decide what action to take. Residents of Palestine will become citizens of the country in which they reside after their country is recognized as independent, but they also have the freedom to choose to live in another country if they wish.

The economic alliance treaty signed by the two countries should include the establishment of a customs union, a monetary exchange system based on common interests, joint transportation of railways, highways, post and telecommunications, joint use of the ports of Haifa and Jaffa, and joint development of water conservancy and land projects. The organization that manages this economic alliance is a joint economic committee composed of three representatives from each of the two countries, together with three foreign members appointed by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. During the transition period of Jerusalem, it will be placed under international trusteeship, with the United Nations organization as the governing authority. Its area includes the existing urban area and nearby towns and villages. The three members of the United Nations Special Committee, India, Iran, and Yugoslavia, support the establishment of a federal independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. The Australian representative abstained from voting on both systems.

Under the partition system, the land of the Jewish state should include the eastern part of Galilee, the Esdraelon Plain, most of the coastal plain, and the entire Beersheba area, including the Negev. The Arab state will include the western part of Galilee, Samaria and Judea, and the plain south along the Egyptian border.

### Arab Nations Oppose Partition: Express Willingness to Use Force

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 1st] Palestinian Arabs feel extremely shocked that the United Nations Committee's proposal includes Haifa, Palestine's largest port, within the territory of the Jewish state. The Hussein Party's newspaper stated that the Arab nation is determined to reject the partition plan and will use force if necessary. Haifa has belonged to the Arabs for 1,300 years and will never be abandoned. Jewish and Arab people here are searching for maps to see the borders of the two countries according to the recommendations of the United Nations Committee. Jamal Husseini, vice chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, telegraphed Arab newspapers here from Cairo, stating that the Arabs will not agree to the committee's report or any partition proposal, and that the Arab nation is determined to continue the struggle. Jewish Agency executives are still in Switzerland and have not been able to express their views on the plan. Non-official Jews generally welcome this partition plan.

### Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany Dismantles Coal Mining Equipment

[Reuters, Hamburg, 31st] The Mining and Metal Industry Department of the Soviet Zone announced on the 30th that the dismantling of German mining equipment had begun immediately for the purpose of reparations.

### Revolution Erupts Again in Ecuador in Opposition to the New Government of Menchina: American Countries May Intervene

[Reuters, Guayaquil, Ecuador, 31st] After Colonel Menchina launched a revolution last week, overthrowing the government of President Ibarra and establishing his own government, military revolutions against the Menchina government broke out today in the cities of Riobamba and Guaranda. Menchina has sent troops from the capital, Quito, to suppress the revolutionary army in Riobamba, 150 kilometers north of the capital.

### Government Gazette States: Other parts of the country are stable. Guayaquil, Ecuador's second largest city and the country's main port, is not experiencing unrest. People here believe that conservative elements support the revolutionary movement, as the conservatives oppose the Menchina government and believe that, constitutionally, Vice President Velasco should succeed Ibarra as president.

[Associated Press, Quito, Ecuador, 1st] There is much speculation among the public regarding what impact the formal signing of the Inter-American Mutual Defense Treaty in the capital of Brazil tomorrow will have on the political situation in Ecuador. On August 24, Ecuador was excluded from the signatory countries of the treaty due to a coup launched by Minister of National Defense Menchina, which overthrew the president. However, the treaty stipulates that if the actions and situation of any country in the Western Hemisphere endanger peace in the Americas, or if the "political independence" of any country is threatened, the foreign ministers of the countries should consult and decide to take collective steps to deal with it. Therefore, the current situation may provoke intervention from various countries.

[United Press International, New York, July 31st] The 29th annual convention of the American Legion, lasting four days, concluded on the 31st. The convention unanimously passed a resolution emphasizing that Communism is the greatest threat to the United States. The association requested that Congress convene a special session to pass universal military training and other national defense-related legislation and demanded that Congress declare the Communist Party illegal. The association's foreign affairs paper also passed a resolution asserting that the dictatorial rulers controlling the Soviet Union are plotting to create economic crises within the United States and abroad.

[United Press International, New York, July 31st] The American Legion unanimously elected Police Chief O'Neil of Manchester, New Hampshire, as the national chairman on the 31st, succeeding Griffiths.

### Four-Power Conference on Korea Unlikely to Achieve Success

[Central News Agency, Washington, July 31st, United Press International] The "Sunday Star" editorial stated: "The only policy that the United States can currently adopt toward Korea is to establish a Korean government in the US-controlled area of South Korea and strengthen its position with various assistance beneficial to the reconstruction of the area." The newspaper continued: "The United States' proposal to hold a four-power conference on the Korean issue here on September 8th has as slim a chance of reaching an agreement as the US-Soviet Joint Commission conducting negotiations in Korea. However, this four-power conference, by demonstrating the Soviet Union's evasiveness and bad faith regarding Korean matters, will enable the United States to pursue its own unilateral policy in South Korea with greater moral and diplomatic backing."

[Central News Agency, Canberra, August 1st] All discussion items for the British Commonwealth United Nations Conference have concluded, and the closing ceremony is scheduled for the morning of the 2nd. According to the communique, the conference discussed the organization, voting procedures, tasks, powers, and implementation methods of the supervisory body for the implementation of the Japanese peace treaty terms, without discussing any detailed proposals.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, July 31st] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's attitude greatly changed after meeting with MacArthur. British Commonwealth representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Bower, was recalled to Australia. However, Evatt's new "leniency policy" has sparked fierce opposition and has now been largely abandoned. From the perspective of the Canberra Conference's stance on the Japanese peace treaty, friction may arise between the United Kingdom and the United States over MacArthur's proposed economic and industrial level for Japan at the preliminary peace treaty conference in Washington. This level is based on the average conditions during the normal peaceful period of 1930 to 1934 and will enable Japan to maintain a standard of living far superior to other Asian countries.

### Greek Parliament to Open on Thursday, New Government Faces Test, New Prime Minister Declares Resolution Never to Yield to Guerrillas

[United Press International, Athens, July 31st] The Greek Parliament has been postponed to open on Thursday, so the new right-wing government led by Tsaldaris can maintain its life for at least five days.

### City Government Convenes Meeting to Save Industrial Production, New Electricity Conservation Measures to Be Strictly Implemented Starting Next Month, Six Methods for Factories to Generate Electricity Themselves Approved

[Reported by this newspaper] This city's electricity conservation discussion meeting was held at 4:30 p.m. yesterday in the city government auditorium, chaired by Mayor Wu. Representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, Police Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, City Council, City Chamber of Commerce, Industrial Association Shanghai Branch, Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, China Textile Construction Company, 6th District Textile Association, and various electric power companies, totaling more than 20 people, attended. After the meeting, Mayor Wu received reporters and solemnly reported the severity of the city's electricity shortage, stating that the electricity consumption of shops and households in the city has exceeded more than double that before the war, while the electricity consumption of factories has decreased compared to before the war. The city government has decided to correct this unreasonable phenomenon. In addition to ordering factories with power generation equipment to generate electricity from now on, electricity consumption by shops and households will be strictly limited. The methods have been instructed by the Public Utilities Bureau and submitted to the City Government for approval by the City Council, and will be implemented from October 1st. According to Mayor Wu, this year's electricity restriction measures will be stricter than last year because the city government is determined to save the city's industrial sector. Otherwise, after production is hit, it is inevitable that a wave of price increases will be triggered. Therefore, electricity conservation is closely related to the skin of the citizens, and we hope to implement it effectively.

### Incentives for Self-Generation of Electricity

The following methods for factories in Shanghai to generate electricity with their own power generation equipment were approved yesterday: (1) In order to cooperate with the General Mobilization Ordinance and alleviate the city's electricity shortage, all factories in the city with their own generators of 100 kilowatts or more should generate electricity themselves within a limited time. Those that have already been purchased and arrived in the city but have not been installed should be transferred to factories willing to purchase them so that they can generate electricity. (2) The amount of electricity generated by the power generation equipment of each factory, in addition to the original factory retaining 50% for its own use, the remainder will be allocated by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. (3) The fuel used for the power generation equipment of each factory will be allocated by the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the price of coal for public utilities after the quantity is verified by the Public Utilities Bureau, or the city government will negotiate with the Central Bank to separately allocate fuel according to these methods from September 1st. (4) All power generation costs, if the cost exceeds the general electricity tariff price, the excess part will be subsidized by the municipal government by drawing funds from the electricity tariff price when setting the tariff price to provide incentives. (5) If any factory delays power generation for any reason, the Public Utilities Bureau may notify the power company to reduce the original power supply to the factory. (6) Once the city's electricity shortage is resolved, the above principles will be cancelled.

### Three Catastrophes in Sichuan Province, Xu Kan Reports on Disaster Situation

[Reported by this newspaper] National Government Comptroller Xu Kan received reporters at the Youth Association yesterday, reported on the disaster situation in Sichuan Province, and appealed to all circles for relief. The general idea was: "Sichuan Province has suffered heavy rains in the southeast, northwest, and throughout the province since late June. From July 1st to 5th, there was torrential rain, mountain torrents broke out, and the water level on the plains rose to between 1 and 2 zhang, turning into the Minjiang, Tuojiang, and Fujiang River basins, as well as the upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin. Houses, livestock, farmland, and property in the counties along the river were all washed away. Many residents were killed or injured. Among them, Chengdu City, located between the Minjiang and Tuojiang Rivers, had eight tenths of the city (including more than 60 streets) submerged. The water level was up to the production pipeline in low-lying areas, and the water depth was 4 or 5 feet in high-lying areas. Outside the city was a vast expanse of water. The factories (because water intake is all along the river), warehouses, docks, sugar warehouses, and coal, firewood, oil, and rice warehouses along the Fu River were all washed away. This was the first catastrophe of the year. From July 30th to August 3rd, there was another heavy rain disaster. Counties such as Mabian and Muchuan suffered heavy disasters, which was the second catastrophe. From August 12th to 14th, torrential rain poured down, causing floods in the Fujiang, Tuo, and Min Rivers. Dozens of counties, including Guanxian, Chengdu, Huayang, Mianyang, Xinjin, and Ebian, suffered a third catastrophe. In terms of existing property losses, Chengdu City suffered the most. In the other 50 or so disaster-stricken counties, the loss of agricultural crops (rice) was the greatest. Not only were the crops washed away, but even fertile farmland was washed into stony fields and sand mines. This year's autumn harvest is naturally hopeless. Even in the next two or three years, it will be difficult to cultivate these stony fields and sand mines. (2) According to the Sichuan Provincial Government's disaster survey report, a total of 46 counties and cities were affected, with losses of more than 700,000 mu of farmland and more than 6,300 houses. More than 489,400 residents were affected, and property losses were estimated at over 100 billion yuan. More than 6,000 people died, and disaster surveys are still being conducted in nine counties, and the losses should not be small. The three catastrophes were truly unspeakable. (3) The current number of disaster-stricken people is at least 600,000. They are destitute, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Their livelihood for the next year and their current medical needs depend on relief from all parties. How can nearly one million mu of fertile farmland that have been washed into stony fields and sand mines be restored to cultivation? How can factories that have been destroyed be restored to operation? How can dikes and bridges be rebuilt? It is even more necessary for the press to appeal to all parties to provide strong assistance so that the people of our anti-Japanese base area can jointly complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country."

After the speech, he distributed the "Statistical Table of Flood Losses in Various Counties of Sichuan Province in the 36th Year," listing the figures in great detail. Liu Hangchen stated: "The number of losses has been calculated by the provincial government after repeated investigations and guarantees that it is accurate."

### Daughter of a Chaotic World: Goes to Nature: International Fallen Woman Dies from Brain Injury, Beyond Saving: Bai Lu Once Served as a Basic Actor in China Film Studio

[This newspaper reports] Du Xiaomu, the woman who accidentally fell down the stairs at the International Hotel the day before yesterday morning, passed away at 7:40 PM last night after being rushed to the China-America Hospital, ultimately succumbing to severe brain trauma and losing consciousness. Du was from Fuling, Sichuan, 28 years old, and her stage name was Bai Lu. Her husband, Mr. Jiang, is a famous young actor from the former Lianhua Film Company. In recent years, he has been running the Shengli Theater in Hong Kong, with thriving business. This trip to Shanghai was partly for inspection purposes. Unfortunately, she encountered this tragic event, causing immense grief. It is said that he has hired lawyer Zhou Hongguang to sue the International Hotel and the elevator operator.

As soon as the news of Du's passing spread to the film industry, prominent directors Shi Dongshan, Wu Yonggang, Meng Junmou, and movie stars Jin Yan, Liu Qiong, Fengzi, and others immediately went to the China-America Hospital to pay their respects.

Du first participated in filming in "Sports Queen", produced by Lianhua and starring Li Lili, and "Going to Nature." During the War of Resistance, she served as a basic actor in China Film Studio, and starred in "Daughter of a Chaotic World," which was highly praised at the time. After marrying her husband, she helped him run the film business, unfortunately, she met with misfortune midway. It truly is a loss for the film industry.

The body must await inspection by the prosecutor before being placed in a coffin at the funeral home.

The original letter and the reply from the Reader Scholarship Fund Committee of this newspaper are recorded below:

"To the esteemed editor: I recently learned that your newspaper is organizing a reader scholarship fund to help youths out of school, benefiting society. Since my return after the war, I have been working at the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, fg.

In recent years, the life of civil servants has been unspeakably difficult. I have five children. My eldest daughter graduated from high school but cannot afford to go to college. My eldest son is studying at the Shanghai Law College High School, my second son is studying at the Su Min Middle School, and my third and fourth sons are studying at the Su Min Elementary School. Tuition fees have increased several times this semester. My monthly income is only 57 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of over 200,000, which is barely enough to feed the family. How can I afford these huge tuition fees? I have long admired your newspaper for serving the welfare of society, and I am writing to request that you allow me to borrow money to pay for my children's tuition fees, to be repaid in three months. I wonder if this can be accommodated?"

[Reader Scholarship Fund Committee Reply] We have read your letter with great sympathy for your difficult situation. The "lending money for tuition, to be repaid in three months, etc." you mentioned does not comply with the application guidelines stipulated by this newspaper, and we are unable to process it. The application procedure for the "Reader Scholarship Fund" organized by this newspaper requires the student to first apply to the school they are attending, be recommended by the principal, and obtain an application form from this newspaper (see yesterday's edition of this newspaper), and then be reviewed to determine whether to accept the application.

### Love Triangle: One Wave After Another: Triangular Romance Turns Into a Mess: Abandoned Woman Happily Meets an Old Flame: Rekindles Old Love Into a "Qin-Jin" Union

[This newspaper reports] The District Court recently received a statement from a young woman from Southeast Asia, Zhu Jie, requesting a notarized separation from her cohabitation relationship with Jin Zhixing. Zhu was originally a student at a specialized school in Southeast Asia, and was friendly with male classmates Qin Jin and Jin Zhixing, which gradually developed into a love triangle. As a result, Zhu fell in love with Jin and discussed marriage. However, Zhu's mother liked Qin and disliked Jin, and did not approve of her marriage to Jin. Zhu disregarded her family's opposition and ran away from home with Jin to Nanjing in August of the 33rd year, where they began cohabiting. After the victory, due to financial difficulties, Jin went back and forth to Hong Kong as a freelance broker. At this time, Zhu received a letter from her mother at home, saying that she missed her daughter very much and hoped she would return home to talk. Zhu also took the time to return to Southeast Asia because she had been away from home for a long time and her husband was in Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, after Zhu returned to Southeast Asia, she learned that Jin had found someone else in Hong Kong, and also learned that Qin Jin had suffered from mental illness due to his love for Zhu after they left Southeast Asia, and was almost crazy. Zhu went to visit him, and Qin's illness suddenly improved. Zhu was touched by Qin's dedication to her, and agreed to devote herself to him. However, Qin had one condition, which was that Zhu must completely break off her relationship with Jin. Zhu went to Hong Kong to find Jin to handle the procedures for breaking off the cohabitation relationship, but was unable to find him. It was said that he had gone to Shanghai. Then she went to Shanghai to look for him but still could not find him. Because Zhu was eager to return to Southeast Asia, she filed a statement with the District Court requesting notarization of her separation from her cohabitation relationship with Jin Zhixing.

### Inside Information in the Beef Shop Robbery Case: Five Suspects Arrested One After Another

[This newspaper reports] At 9:35 PM on the 18th of last month, four bandits broke into the Maolin Beef Shop at 92 Maoming South Road, used the excuse of buying two bottles of orange juice to threaten the shop assistant Shan Yunting and others with guns, and robbed them of American dollars, national currency, gold bars, gold jewelry, and other items, estimated to be worth over 100 million yuan, and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the owner, Zhu Guishan, reported the case to the Lujiawan Police Station. Director Zhao, upon receiving the report, urgently ordered Section Chief Hao of the Criminal Investigation Section to dispatch Inspector Qin and police officers Hao Chen, Ma Shaosong, and Liu Guozhang to investigate. The owner was questioned in detail about the incident, and it was believed that there must have been inside information. Undercover officers were dispatched to the vicinity of the shop to patrol and secretly investigate the whereabouts of the bandits. At 10:00 AM on the 19th, a man was seen loitering in the area, acting suspiciously, and whispering to the shop assistant. It was later learned that the man's name was Zhu Achang, 21 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 218 Xinxin Lane, 409 Zhongzheng South 2nd Road. Three months ago, he was a shop assistant. Therefore, at 9:30 AM on the 23rd, he was arrested on Maoming South Road, Linsen Middle Road, and taken to the station for interrogation. He finally confessed to the robbery and implicated his accomplices Li Yingchun (also known as A Hong), Zhu Amao, and the shop employee Li Agen as an inside accomplice who planned the robbery. The police arrested them together on Zhongzheng South 2nd Road and Maoming South Road, and also arrested the receiver of stolen goods, Xu Fuhe, and recovered part of the stolen goods. The case has been fully investigated and will be submitted to the District Court this month for handling.

### Li Shifan Accused of Forgery: His Girlfriend Claims a Romantic Relationship: Fondly Requests Bail

[This newspaper reports] Lu Ying (Xiao Ying), the female owner of the Meiguang Shoe Shine Company on Xizang Middle Road, accused Li Shifan of forgery and fraud. The District Prosecutor's Office has detained Li and filed a public prosecution. Unexpectedly, Lu, cherishing old feelings, felt heartbroken upon seeing Li detained, and filed a statement with the District Prosecutor's Office requesting bail for Li. Her petition stated, "The plaintiff, complying with the repeated requests of the family of the defendant Li Shifan, and considering that the plaintiff and the defendant Li Shifan previously had a romantic relationship, and not without regard for old feelings, the defendant is young and inexperienced, and thus fell into the clutches of the law. The circumstances are excusable, and the defendant's family has a large number of people who depend on him for support. Once imprisoned, their livelihood will be cut off, which is even more pitiful. Therefore, I am filing this statement requesting your review and approval, and considering that the defendant is a first-time offender, to leniently grant bail so that he can rehabilitate himself. I will be eternally grateful." Yesterday, the prosecutor's remarks on this wonderful document were few: "Received. This case has already been filed for public prosecution and will be sent to the criminal court for handling."

### Delivering Love Letters and Fantasizing: Lawyer Deceived and Lost Money: Finally Realizing It's Intolerable

[This newspaper reports] Lawyer Ji Chao filed a lawsuit with the Tilanqiao Police Station last month accusing Wang Qinggui of fraud. After the police station arrested Wang, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Wang Qinggui, 26 years old, from Baoshan, opened the Qingcheng Rice Shop at 947 Dong Yuhang Road. Because business was slow and funds were tight, he borrowed 3 million yuan from Ji in June. Ji asked him for a guarantor, but Wang forged two seals of the Nanyang Iron Factory and Yu Siren and stamped them on the IOU, defrauding him of 3 million yuan. Not long after, the rice shop closed down and Wang fled to Tianjin, and then returned to Shanghai. He suddenly had a bizarre idea, falling in love with Ji Chao's daughter, Ji Guoying. He sent love letters to Ji's daughter, calling her Miss Mary, persuading her to leave her family, and arranging to meet her at the Queen's Cafe on Sanma Road at 3 PM on the 22nd of last month. After Ji's daughter received the letter, she told her father, who then reported it to the Tilanqiao Police Station. Police officers were dispatched to wait. When Wang arrived late, he was arrested. After Wang confessed to fraud and being in love with Ji's daughter, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation and released on bail pending trial.

### On the Eve of the Xi'an-Shanghai-Hankou Joint Passenger and Freight Transport: The Longhai Railway Is Being Improved

— Special Dispatch From Xi'an, August 25, From Our Correspondent Li Chi

Eighth Timber Bridge on the Longhai Line: Impresses Foreign Engineers

[Dispatch From Xi'an, August 25] The eighth timber bridge on the Longhai Railway, which impressed foreign engineers with its amazing construction, has now been completed at risk. It measures 118 feet long and 42 meters high. Part of the bridge has been rebuilt into a reinforced concrete bridge, but traffic has never been interrupted for a single day.

The Longhai Railway extends from Lianyungang in the east to Tianshui in the west, a total of more than 1,600 kilometers, making it the longest east-west railway trunk line in our country. However, due to repeated destruction by natural and man-made disasters during and after the war, the Tong (Guan) Luo (Yang) section and the Tian (Shui) Bao (Ji) section were hastily built, so the entire line has not yet been fully connected, and even those that can be used are often operated intermittently. However, in the past nine months, since the new Director Mo Heng took office, he has been determined to rectify the situation. The 16-kilogram light rails in the entire line were first completely replaced, and 200,000 new sleepers were replaced. The temporary bridges and roads between Tongguan and Shaanxi Prefecture were eliminated and replaced with standard bridges and roads. The Xian (Yang) Tong (Chuan) branch line was improved, and the Tongguan Tunnel was completed. The wages for all of the above totaled 45 billion yuan! The local appearance of the Longhai Line has been renewed since then. However, the complete rectification and smooth flow of the entire line still awaits the completion of the following projects in progress. Please start with a brief description from the western end:

The Baotian Railway is only 100 kilometers long, but it has 120 tunnels, an average of one tunnel per li, which is visible here. Moreover, the slope in this section is very large, and the entire line is built windingly on sandy hills, facing the mountains and water. During construction, limited by manpower, financial resources, and time, the tunnels had to be shortened as much as possible, and the passages that should have been built at the tunnel entrances were replaced by "open cuts." Moreover, the slope on both sides is far from the angle of a "natural slope," so it is inevitable that the sand and soil on both sides will collapse during the rainy season or due to driving. Therefore, the number of collapses in the Baotian section is the highest in the country. More than 400,000 cubic meters of collapses were cleared last year, and more than 100,000 cubic meters this year. In recent weeks, the rainy season has arrived in Shaanxi and Gansu. In just a few days, the collapses have reached 40,000 cubic meters. Although the clearing is being stepped up, it is expected that it will collapse again after clearing. A thorough solution may not be possible in the short term. However, the employees of this section have always done their best.

Man fighting against nature will be able to resume operation after the rainy season ends this autumn.

The Tongguan Tunnel on the border between Shaanxi and Henan was bombed by the Japanese army across the river hundreds of times during the war. The cave was shaken and cracks appeared. In recent years, it has been supported by wooden frames with great effort, which is not a safe long-term plan. In May this summer, construction of a new tunnel with a length of 468 meters began. Due to the impact of the war in Fenglingdu recently, the project has been postponed until the beginning of next month.

The 300-kilometer track east of Shaanxi Prefecture to Zhengzhou was temporarily assembled after the victory, and the variety of styles can be called the "World Rail Exhibition." The impact on driving speed and safety is significant. Although the 16-kilogram light rails in the section have been replaced, there are still 60-pound, 65-pound, and other mixed rails interspersed between them. It is expected that all of them will be replaced with

Standard heavy rails by the end of this year to increase the load capacity.

Between the Xiashi Station and Guanyintang Station (belonging to Mianchi County, Henan), there is a large bridge with a length of more than 100 meters and a height of 40 meters, commonly known as the "Eighth Bridge." In the past, in order to expedite traffic, a timber bridge was erected at risk. However, limited by the load capacity, only small locomotives could pull 200-ton trains through. In other words, trains between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou with a tonnage of 1,200 to 1,500 tons have to be divided into six or seven trains at this bottleneck, which greatly affects the transport volume and speed. In May of this year, renovation began, using the original steel beams for repair and building a Western-style concrete bridge. Moreover, since this formal bridge is built on the same site as the timber bridge, in order to maintain the continued operation of the timber bridge, only a part of the timber can be removed at a time, and then reinforced concrete piers are built to support it. The construction procedure is extremely laborious. At present, 90% of the entire project has been completed, and it is expected to be completed by the middle of next month.

Between Heishiguan and Xiaoyi stations east of Luoyang, there is also a large bridge across the Luo River, with a total of seven holes and a length of 310 meters, making it the longest on the Haizhou Line. Among them,

The timber bridge was washed away by water at the end of last month, and at present only wooden boats are used to connect the two sides. It is expected that although the construction of the temporary bridge will be stepped up before the end of the rainy season at the end of September, it may still be washed away again at any time even if it is open to traffic. The permanent concrete bridge foundations have long been completed, and most of the steel beams allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have been shipped to Shanghai. After being erected in Shanghai, they will be disassembled and transported to Luoyang for assembly. The solution to the problem is only a matter of time.

There are still a dozen small bridges between Luoyang and Zhengzhou. The concrete piers have been built one after another, and 56 holes of steel beams under the US-Canada loan have also been allocated by the Ministry of Communications. It is expected that all the main bridges will be completed within this year. In this way,

Huge hangars can tow long trains and pass smoothly.

The Minquan, Xiaoba, and Shangqiu sections east of Kaifeng were destroyed again on the 10th of this month, but were repaired on the 16th.

East of Xuzhou, it has been repaired to Xin'an Town, and west of Lianyungang, it has been repaired to Baitabu. The distance between the two ends of the secondary road is about 70 kilometers of track. If they are collected separately, the whole project can be completed. The Railway Bureau has submitted another plan to the Ministry of Communications for approval. If it proceeds smoothly and is no longer affected by military affairs, it is expected that by the end of this year, it will be possible to travel directly from Lianyungang to Baoji, transfer to a small locomotive, and trace Tianshui to the west. Then the equipment of the Tianlan Railway, as well as the sea salt in the northwest that depends on the coast, can be unloaded and transported directly from Lianyungang. The furs of Gansu and Qinghai and the famous Shaanxi cotton can also be sold to the east through this route. As early as next month when the "Eighth Bridge" is open, the Railway Bureau plans to implement the following freight and passenger services: (1) A direct express train between Chang'an and Xuzhou is planned to run once a day; (2) Joint passenger and freight transport between Chang'an and Shanghai, and is responsible for compensating for accidental losses; (3) Joint passenger and freight transport between Zhengzhou and Pukou; (4) Joint passenger and freight transport between Chang'an and Hankou.

### Henan Land and Food Bureau Responds to the Ministry of Food: Request to Temporarily Delay the Lifting of Food Transport Restrictions

[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, 27th of this Month] Previously, Henan Province, in order to stabilize grain prices, had regulations prohibiting the transportation of grain out of the province. Recently, the Ministry of Food, considering that the wheat harvest for this year had passed and the grain situation had improved, ordered the province to report on the abolition of the previous measures. After receiving the order, the Land and Food Bureau reported that: (1) banditry is rampant in the province, and this year has seen both drought and flooding. During the wheat harvest, eastern and northern Henan were widely looted by bandits, and grain sources are tight. At this time of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, with large armies gathering, the army's logistical support has suddenly increased. If grain transportation restrictions are lifted, it will inevitably lead to grain being transported out of the province, making requisitioning and borrowing difficult. (2) More than fifty counties in the province are bandit areas. Military commanders have repeatedly sent telegrams ordering the strengthening of grain blockade. If this blockade is lifted, grain may be transferred to support the bandits, which is difficult to prevent. Affecting the people's food is a minor matter, but delaying military supplies is a major one. (3) In recent years, the supply and demand of grain in Henan Province have been balanced, and grain price fluctuations have not been severe. This is all due to the prohibition of transportation to other provinces. Currently, grain prices in neighboring provinces to the east and west are higher than in this province. If transportation restrictions are lifted, the people will compete to sell food and transport it out, which will inevitably create a grain panic in this province, a matter of great importance. (4) Grain can be freely transported between counties in Henan Province, and strict orders have been issued to all counties to comply with this, and there is no obstruction of transportation. Based on the above points, due to the special circumstances of this province, after careful consideration, it is still necessary to continue to implement the prohibition of grain transportation out of the province. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Food requesting a temporary delay in lifting the restrictions, in order to prevent future troubles.

### Strange Fetus in Fujian: One Child, One Monkey, One Duck

[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, August 29th] The wife of a Mr. Chen, a resident of Pengcheng Township in Changle, eastern Fujian, recently gave birth to one child, one monkey, and one duck, shocking the neighborhood and spreading as a strange tale. After investigation, it was learned that the woman was nine months pregnant and suddenly complained of severe abdominal pain a few days ago, becoming breathless. The villagers rushed into the city at night to invite a doctor to the village for emergency treatment and injections. First, a girl was born, but the abdomen was still in severe pain, and the placenta had not yet detached. The doctor performed surgery again, and after more than ten hours, two dead fetuses were removed. One weighed about six pounds, with one head, four hands, and four feet, and a face like a monkey. The other weighed about three pounds, with no anus or reproductive organs, covered in hair, and very similar to a duck. It seems that a mixture of humans and animals was born in one pregnancy, which the villagers found very surprising and suspected to be an ominous sign.

### Military Staff Member in Jinshan Embezzles Conscription Funds and Flees; County Magistrate Orders Arrest

[Special Dispatch from Jinshan, August 30th] A few military service personnel have been found to have conscripted more soldiers than needed and overcharged villagers for food rations to enrich themselves privately. Pan Qunpu, a military staff member of the Jinshan County Government, took advantage of the transition between the old and new county magistrates to introduce new recruits to various townships and towns, charging a price of six million per person. Subsequently, Huangqiao Township prepaid nine million yuan, Maogang Township six million yuan, and Damang Township one million yuan, with the remaining payment to be made when the new recruits were picked up. On the 28th, the township head Xu Haiyuan and others went to his residence to pay the money and pick up the recruits for camp, but unexpectedly Pan had moved everything away with his family in the late night of the 27th and fled without a trace. The township heads reported the situation to the county government. County Magistrate Wang Zhaozeng was furious upon receiving the report and ordered a strict arrest and return to justice.

### Failed Attempt to Raise Rent, Sudden Cruelty: Mother of Li Ming, Former Manchurian Star, Kidnaps Without Success, Steals Ring Instead

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, September 1st] Another incident has occurred regarding the house in the care of Mr. Yu Youren, managed by the mother of former Manchurian star Li Ming. Li Ming's mother threatened the tenant to increase the rent, causing a soldier, Wu Wende, to attempt to kidnap the tenant without success and then commit robbery, which led to his arrest. Mr. Yu Youren owns a house at No. 1 Juer Hutong in Beiping. During the Anti-Japanese War, he entrusted Li Ming to manage it. Li was sentenced to prison for treason because of suspicion that he had plotted to harm her former husband, who was working underground. Li's mother continued to look after the house for Mr. Yu Youren. To increase the rent, she had several quarrels with the tenant, Liu Renfeng, and suspected that Li Ming's imprisonment was due to her report. A few days ago, she threatened that if the rent was not increased, they would "see what would happen," and then ordered Lu Jingde and two others to kidnap her. On the 30th, in the heavy rain, the three strong men entered the house. Seeing that the Liu family was eating corn bread, they failed to kidnap her and only stole three rings and a leather suitcase from the Liu family before leaving. Afterwards, Liu reported the incident, and all the criminals were arrested.

### Wuxi Massive Fraud Case: Fictitious Salt Firm Defrauds One Hundred Million

[Special Dispatch from Wuxi, August 31st] Sheng Xinggen, from Shenganli, Huibei Township, Tangqiao District, in the western suburbs, falsely established a salt firm in July of this year and defrauded Tu Xiquan, Zha Jinmei, and 17 others of 506 zu of salt money, promising delivery by a deadline. However, the delivery was repeatedly postponed until nothing was delivered. In reality, the firm was completely fictitious, and a huge amount of money was defrauded. In addition, there were armed threats. Because Tu and others were concerned that Sheng Xinggen would flee, they arrested Sheng on the evening of the 30th and brought him to the North District Police Station for investigation. The next day happened to be Sunday, so it was decided that he would be transferred to the Police Headquarters on the 1st and then to the Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. Based on the current salt price, the value is about one hundred million yuan.

### Zhenjiang Volunteer Soldiers Crowd Military Service Demonstration Zone

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, August 30th] Since Jiangsu Province began recruiting volunteer soldiers, people from all counties north and south of the Yangtze River, who have suffered greatly from the communist bandits in the past, have learned from their pain and are eager to dedicate themselves to the country and eliminate the communist bandits to quell the source of chaos. Therefore, the number of applicants is extremely enthusiastic. It is reported that, as of now, the province has recruited 2,060 volunteer soldiers.

According to our newspaper reader Guan Cha: The new recruits who have been sent to Zhenjiang have been instructed on the methods of the military garrison area, the layout of their camp, and the daily necessities used by the new recruits, which have indeed entered the "military school" stage. This can be seen from the clean beds used by the new recruits, the white towels, and the tidy and clean cooking utensils. As for the nutritional problems of the new recruits, it can also be proved by the rosy complexions and energetic appearance of some new recruits that they have been properly resolved, but the person in charge of the military garrison area is not satisfied with this and still intends to gradually improve it in order to live up to the honorary title of "Military Service Demonstration Zone." It is reported that the resettlement allowance for new recruits in Zhenjiang, including everything, is said to be no more than five million yuan per person. In the Zhenjiang new recruit camp, there are the beloved sons of village chiefs, school teachers, college and middle school students, and employees of large shops. They are all volunteers to join the army and support the government's plan to suppress the rebellion and build the country with their actions. This is a good phenomenon that a "Military Service Demonstration Zone" should have.

Prices in Zhenjiang City have soared again. Cigarettes have risen the most sharply. Oils and general daily necessities are all rising in a straight line. Rice prices have risen by more than 10%, but because the battle situation in northern Jiangsu has improved, the source of rice is not a major problem, and rice prices can still be expected to fall back.

With the general election approaching, a prosperous future is beginning to be reflected in the Zhenjiang market. The hotel and restaurant industries have begun to prepare, and the restaurants that have been closed for a long time have put up new shop signs. However, those engaged in regional and professional group elections in Zhenjiang are mostly preparing and arranging with a very cautious attitude, especially the press, because in today's democratic learning, some enlightened people who have infinite hope for the future of the people's livelihood in China may "look to the reporters" without expecting it, to see how you do it. Therefore, when people hear that colleagues in the press in various parts of the province will handle a "reporter qualification issue" with a very cautious attitude, it seems very happy.

### Annular Solar Eclipse on May 9th Next Year; Calculation Completed; Partial Eclipse Will Be Visible Throughout the Country; Eclipse Fraction Greatest in Shanghai and Hangzhou Area

[Special Dispatch from Qingdao, August 27th] The news of the "annular solar eclipse" on May 9th next year was first published in this newspaper. The calculation work has been completed by the Qingdao Observatory. It is now known that the path of the annular eclipse starts from 77 degrees 8 minutes east longitude and 2 degrees 33 minutes north latitude in the Indian Ocean and gradually moves towards the southeastern mainland of our country. At about 1:20 (Universal Time), it will land on the coast near Lianjiang, Guangdong. The width of the annular eclipse visible in that area is about 19 kilometers, and the length of the central eclipse time is about 19 seconds. From then on, it will traverse the southeastern mainland of our country, passing through Lianjiang, Xinyi, Luoding, the Shakou Station of the Yuehan Railway, Nanxiong, Shixing, Ganzhou, Ningdu Huangpi Town, Nanfeng, the Dalu Station of the Zhegan Railway, Kaihua Huabu Town, Ningan, Wukang, Wujiang, Taicang Shuangfeng Town, Lusi Port and other places. The width of the annular eclipse visible along the way and the length of the annular eclipse time will gradually decrease. At more than 1:50 (Universal Time), reaching the vicinity of Lusi Port, the area where the annular eclipse can be seen is only about 3.5 kilometers wide, and the length of the annular eclipse is 4.7 seconds. After that, it will resume its maritime life, and after carrying the Korean Peninsula, in the Sea of Japan, at 132 degrees 47 minutes east longitude and 40 degrees 51 minutes north latitude, a total eclipse may occur in a short time. Afterwards, the width of the annular eclipse area and the length of the annular eclipse time will gradually increase until it ends the entire annular eclipse journey at 135 degrees 10 minutes west longitude and 43 degrees 40 minutes north latitude in the Pacific Ocean. A partial eclipse can be seen throughout our country. The earliest eclipse is seen in the southern Xisha Islands, and the latest is at the confluence of the Ussuri River and the Heilongjiang River. The total time for the eclipse to be seen within the country is about four hours. The eclipse fraction is the largest in the Shanghai and Hangzhou area, all above 99%, and gradually decreases towards the northwest.

[British News Service, London, August 31st] Sir Alexander, the British inventor of penicillin, lectured yesterday at the British Science Association.

### Joint Annual Meeting of Seven Scientific Organizations Successfully Concludes Yesterday; Launch Initiative to Organize National Federation of Scientific Organizations

[Report from this newspaper] The joint annual meeting of seven scientific organizations, including the China Science Society, was held for three days. The meeting proceeded smoothly and concluded successfully yesterday afternoon. Hundreds of members, including Ren Hongjun, Zhu Kezhen, Qiu Weiyu, Lu Yudao, and Zhang Mengwen, attended the various meetings for the past three days despite the hot summer, and engaged in heated discussions. The annual meeting achieved great success, which has profound significance for the advancement of scientific research in our country in the future. At 3 pm yesterday, the seven organizations held an administrative meeting at the Shanghai Medical College, presided over by Lu Yudao, the general secretary of the annual meeting, to discuss important proposals and resolve as follows: (1) The issue of unifying the "World Calendar," which was approved by the Ministry of Education in the 24th year of the Republic of China, will be replied to the World Calendar Society as originally proposed. (2) The Nanjing Joint Association Office will be convened by the China Society of Natural Sciences to handle the matter.

### Professor Zhang Qiyun Gave a Lecture at the YMCA Yesterday: China in Suffering

[Report from this newspaper] The joint annual meeting of the seven scientific organizations held a public lecture at the YMCA Auditorium in the Baixianqiao at 3 pm yesterday, with Professor Zhang Qiyun giving a lecture on the topic of "China in Suffering." He discussed China's border issues from the perspective of political geography, stating that the Lushun-Dalian issue has been a source of turmoil in East Asia since the end of the 19th century. Its impact can be compared to Istanbul in the Mediterranean. After the war, the Soviet Union demanded joint defense of Istanbul, which Turkey flatly refused, but China could not. Now Lushun-Dalian is the center of international communist activity in the three major peninsulas of Northeast China (Korea, Liaodong, and Shandong). Conversely, economically, international trade has not yet been opened up, and it is actually a dead port. The serious situation in Northeast China has not diminished compared to the September 18th Incident. The area of Outer Mongolia that was lost is greater than that of Northeast China, and its population is only 800,000, less than that of Nanjing City. It is difficult to form an independent country on its own, but it is actually invading our Xinjiang, which is just one wave in a large trend. The overall situation in Xinjiang is turbulent and unstable, and the special situation in the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan has not yet improved. If the conspiracy of the Turkestan Republic is not stopped, Xinjiang may become the second Outer Mongolia, with endless troubles. Tibet has a high degree of autonomy, and is only one step away from independence. The area west of the Jinsha River is already beyond reach. Since the recent coup in Tibet, the centrifugal force has been strengthened. The boundary between northern Yunnan and Burma has not yet been demarcated. The Jiangxinpo and Hugong Valley originally belonged to China, and the area connects China and India. A highway was built here during the war to drive out the Japanese invaders. The Yunnan-Burma border issue cannot remain unresolved for long. In terms of the sea border, after the recovery of Guangzhou Bay, it was renamed Zhanjiang City, which will be the export port for the future southwest railway trunk line. The outdated colonial system of Hong Kong and Macao urgently needs to be resolved satisfactorily through peaceful negotiations. The recovery of Taiwan and the establishment of Hainan Province are great opportunities for our country to restore its maritime power. Taiwan was occupied for half a century, and its national consciousness is still strong. The recent incident was aimed at reforming internal affairs, but it has left a bad impression internationally. In short, China is currently in the midst of internal and external troubles, with the two causing and seeking each other. The problem with the Soviet Union is the first diplomatic difficulty. The various crises in Sino-Soviet relations are due to the imbalance of national power between the two countries. Only by making concerted efforts to increase production and build the country in earnest can we increase national power and ensure internal and external security. Agriculture, forestry, fishery, mining, water conservancy, industry, transportation, and trade are the nine major guidelines for building the country. Northeast China, the northern border, the northwest, the western border, the southwest, the great river, the Yangtze River, Lingnan, and the islands are the nine major areas for construction. If any guideline or any area is slightly unbalanced, it can lead to major incidents. There is no shortcut to saving the country. Foreign aid is unreliable. Only by overall planning for production and construction can we seek a balance of national power between China and foreign countries, so as to ensure sovereignty and maintain peace.

[Another Report] Yesterday (the 1st) morning, the Chinese Geographical Society held its first paper meeting at the Shanghai Medical College, with more than 30 people, including Zhu Kezhen, attending and presenting more than ten papers. Xie Jiarong, a member of the Resources Committee and director of the Mineral Exploration Office, presented a paper on the mineral resources of the Dahuainan Basin, stating that according to recent surveys, the coal reserves in the Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui Province are over 1 billion tons, exceeding those of the Kailuan Coal Mine. This is the most important discovery in coal production in recent years and is extremely important for the supply of power for industrialization in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

### China Commercial Bank Establishes Memorial Scholarship

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Commercial Bank, founded in the 23rd year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the former Qing dynasty, was the first bank established in our country. This year, April 26th, marks the 50th anniversary of the bank's founding. Mr. Du Yuesheng, a director of the bank, in order to cultivate talent for national service, and to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its founding, has specially allocated a special fund of 100 million national currency as a scholarship fund, and accepted cash gifts from all sectors totaling more than 150 million yuan, which will also be used as part of the scholarship fund. The bank will organize a scholarship management committee to use the interest to assist poor students. It is understood that the scholarship for this semester is set at 100 million yuan, which has been properly allocated by the bank, and letters have been sent to various schools requesting cooperation in setting up scholarship quotas. The allocation of quotas for each school is as follows: (A) Seven universities, with a scholarship of 800,000 yuan per student for national institutions and 1 million yuan per student for private institutions. The quotas are: (1) 10 students in the Department of Economics of National Central University; (2) 5 students in the Department of Agricultural Economics of Jinling University; (3) 5 students in the Department of Banking of National Shanghai College of Commerce; (4) 10 students in the Department of Financial Management of National Chiao Tung University; (5) 10 students in the Department of Accounting of National Fudan University; (6) 5 students in Hujiang College of Commerce; (7) 5 students in Guanghua College of Commerce. (B) Ten middle schools, with a scholarship of 800,000 yuan per student. The quotas are: (1) 10 students in Zhengshi Middle School; (2) 10 students in Pudong Middle School; (3) 10 students in Shanghai Provincial Middle School; (4) 5 students in Chuneng Middle School; (5) 10 students in Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Vocational School; (6) 5 students in Lixin Accounting School; (7) 5 students in Minli Middle School; (8) 5 students in Chengzhong Middle School; (9) 5 students in Nanyang Model Middle School; (10) 5 students in Zhonghua Vocational School.

### Mayor Wu Sternly States: Overcharging Tuition Will Be Prosecuted as Embezzlement; Secret Reports Will Be Accepted and Thoroughly Investigated and Punished

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu, concerned about the few schools in this city that are overcharging tuition and miscellaneous fees, specially invited reporters from various newspapers to the Municipal Government Reception Room at 5:30 pm yesterday to report on the following four points: (1) The amount of fees to be charged by each school in the next semester has been discussed and decided by the Municipal Government and relevant authorities. No school is allowed to exceed this amount. Recently, the Municipal Government has received many confidential letters from various sectors, reporting on the arbitrary collection of tuition fees by various schools. The Municipal Government will conduct a thorough investigation, and those found to be true will be punished. (2) Any school that requests an increase in tuition fees due to good facilities and excellent academic performance shall not overcharge before the Education Bureau has approved it. Otherwise, the Municipal Government will prosecute it as embezzlement. It is hoped that all schools can take the lead in promoting the spirit of abiding by the law. (3) The Municipal Government will first set a reasonable standard for tuition fees for the next semester, and at the same time, it will hold scholarships. It has now raised 5.1 billion yuan and is still actively proceeding. There should be no problem with tuition fees for the next semester. (4) The recent establishment of the "Student Academic Guarantee Association" in this city is something that the Municipal Government has no idea how it came about, and its content seems to be specious. The Municipal Government will not allow the existence of such an illegal organization that borrows a name. In the future, if students have any difficulties, they can negotiate with me in a private capacity.

Municipal Government and Education Bureau Establish Investigation Team

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu once convened a meeting of principals of private primary and secondary schools, and stipulated that the standard for fees charged by private schools should be 1 million for high school, 800,000 for junior high school, and 500,000 for primary school in principle, but schools with excellent facilities, a long history, and open finances may apply for an increase. After this regulation was announced, general schools requested increases. In order to strictly enforce the regulations, the Municipal Government and the Education Bureau each sent three representatives to form three investigation teams, each with two members, to conduct on-site investigations at various schools. There are two investigation items: (1) those who request an increase in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Government; (2) those who request an increase in construction fees. It is reported that the investigation began last Saturday, and it is stipulated that 20 schools will be investigated every day, and a total of 100 schools in the city will be investigated, and all investigations will be completed within this week.

It is hoped that all parents will report to the government

The Municipal Government issued an order to the Municipal Education Bureau, saying: "It is found that the upper semester of this year in this city is about to begin. The fee standards for private primary and secondary schools have been stipulated and should be notified to all schools immediately: (1) Absolutely no fees shall exceed the stipulated fees; (2) Those who are collecting fees and exceeding the regulations should immediately announce the refund at the beginning of the school year; (3) Those who apply for over-quota collection shall not collect the excess before the bureau has approved it, and should wait for the approval before announcing the bureau's approval documents in the school for supplementary collection; (4) For schools that do not comply with the regulations, the bureau will order the board of directors to remove its负责人and report within a prescribed time limit, otherwise the bureau will send personnel to act as代理。The Bureau is ordered to strictly comply with the above and report at any time!" In addition, the Municipal Education Bureau issued a public notice, stating: "The highest fee standards for private primary and secondary schools are 500,000 yuan for primary schools, 800,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 1 million yuan for high schools. If there are any excesses, it is hoped that the parents of students and all sectors of society will report them. The Education Bureau will also send personnel to secretly investigate, and those found will be severely punished."

Academic Guarantee Association to be Banned by the Police Bureau

Recently, the "Shanghai Student Academic Guarantee Federation" in this city issued a declaration and posted slogans, but since there is no address, no person in charge, no list of participating schools and representatives, and no registration with the Accounting and Statistics Bureau, Li, the Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, issued a written statement, stating that since the association has not been registered, it has announced its establishment and openly carried out activities, which is a clear violation of the General Mobilization Order issued by the National Government. In order to maintain national laws and regulations and maintain social peace, this bureau has transferred the matter to the police bureau for prohibition, ordering the association to stop all activities from now on.

### After Settlement Procedures are Agreed Upon Today, US Treasury Bills Can be Sold; National Bank has Received Order to Settle Based on US Exchange Rate

[Our Newspaper's Report] The order for the 36-year short-term treasury bills, which were approved by the Executive Yuan, to be repaid with principal and interest based on the US exchange rate, was officially issued to the Central Bank yesterday. The bank originally planned to resume the sale of short-term treasury bills based on the US exchange rate after receiving the order. However, since the US exchange rate cannot be changed on a daily basis, there are technical difficulties in notifying the branches in various places to handle it uniformly. Mr. Liu, the Deputy Governor of the Head Office, Mr. Xu, the Vice Minister of Finance, and Mr. Chen, the Director of the Public Debt Department, met to discuss this matter yesterday afternoon. They believed that the technology was quite complicated, so although they had obtained an outline after the discussion, it still needed to be discussed further this morning. Once a final conclusion is reached, it is expected that the sale of short-term treasury bills can be officially resumed from tomorrow.

In addition, according to Fan Heyan, Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Gold Bond Issuance Committee; after the 府decided to depreciate the principal and interest according to the US exchange rate, not only can the people's faith in the government's determination to maintain credit be further enhanced, but also (1) it will arouse the people's interest in buying bonds. (2) A large amount of idle funds will have the opportunity to return. (3) The issuance and sale of 300 million US Treasury bills will become smoother. If the issuance amount is increased in the future, or if other bonds are issued, it will make the people more willing to buy them. (4) It is a reasonable and safe method to depreciate the principal and interest of foreign currency bonds according to the market price, and the people will definitely be eager to buy them.

Social Services Response to Ms. Xiuwen (Original Letter Published in Yesterday's Newspaper)

Ms. Xiuwen: We have received and read your letter. We sympathize deeply with your situation. However, we regret to say that we cannot offer much help. Although engaging in physical relations with your loved one before marriage may have been due to impulse and overwhelming emotions, it was still an irrational act that could have serious consequences. Now that things have developed to this point, the path you should follow is clear. First, you should honestly tell your mother about what happened to gain her understanding. If she is a truly loving mother, she will forgive you. Second, you should inform your loved one and try to get married as soon as possible if possible. For the sake of your own future happiness and the future status of your child in society, we believe this is the best course of action. As for your father, he may still "strongly disapprove," but as the situation has already evolved to this point, perhaps he will no longer stubbornly hold his prejudices.

Abortion is not only harmful to your body but also a violation of criminal law (please note Article 288 of Chapter 24 of the Criminal Code on abortion). Do not attempt it under any circumstances, or it will bring tragic consequences. (Editor)

The Comedies of Trieste by Zhao Jingshen

Clowns wearing colorful clothes, without any sense of time, roaming everywhere with guitars and huqins, are the favorite subject matter of Italian playwrights. These clowns are wanderers, still drifting around, and no one knows where they will go.

What is described here are the comedies of Trieste. Trieste is a city on the Italian coast, 73 miles northeast of Venice. The old city was built on a steep mountain, while the current city is on the coast. The most important leader in the comedy world is Cecchelin, who performs at the Teatro Filodrammatico.

The stage obviously has no windows, and the audience feels unusually hot when they enter, with the air filled with tobacco smoke. This stage has been open for seventeen years, mocking those who boast and have authority. The year of its creation was August 1929. The first play was "The Street of Commerce" (La Strada del Commercio) by Leghissa. Leghissa was also an actor on the stage. Cecchelin became famous for this play, rising to become a leading star. Unfortunately, the plays performed were too short. Cecchelin performed for a month and a half in front of an indifferent audience, perhaps needing to find another path. Fortunately, he had Woelfier behind him, who believed he was worth cultivating.

His hatred of dictatorship was strong and difficult to hide, so he received 187 warnings, was monitored, and was arrested three times. His performances were also punished with suspensions: the first time for 40 days, the second time for seven months, and the third time for twenty-two months.

Every time he went on stage, the audience waited for him. His humor could cater to the psychology of Italians, who are lazy, comfortable, and happy. He believed in "Anyone" (Uomoqualumque) ideology, and was extremely helpful to others. Sometimes irrelevant people would knock on his bedroom door. He would put on his pajamas, open the door to greet them, and the guest would tell a story of suffering, speaking of how he had been persecuted by nationalism. Naturally, he took the money and left. A series of such people, each telling a story more touching than the last. He used a lot of money for good deeds; when the money ran out, he gave away clothes. When he had given away all his money and clothes, he went to jail in his pajamas, and no one came to visit him in jail.

What best expresses Marchilin's personality is when he is talking to friends on the street in the play. He used the convenience of the clown to talk about political situations and foreign affairs.

Frontier by Ren Weiyin

This is a poor little town, with a very flat and smooth street running through the northeast, but this is a relic of history, belonging to a very short stage in the town's long years. Now, this little town only has rows of dilapidated houses, displaying the marks of wind and rain erosion. Under the black, short, and broken houses, pairs of dead fish-like eyes are always secretly spying on something, trying to discover something in this empty space. On both sides, bare and dilapidated high mountains, covered with straw raincoats of weeds, are like the people in this town, carrying out ancient lookouts in the wind and sand. But under this yellow earth is buried full of alkali, and the natural salt spring has long been exhausted. The dreams of past prosperity have disappeared in time, just like the bare mountains are weathering away. Everything here is quiet, sluggish, and lifeless.

Two intersecting roads extend out of the green shade on the labor wall. People also live inside. Winding paths and small bridges cross the flowing water. There are remnants of the railings and painted bars scattered on both sides. The stagnant water under the bridge is already dirty, but in spring there are still white double-petal peach blossoms secretly revealing some beauty in the bushes, symbolizing the past prosperity. In the eyes of a mourner, it is so cold and terrible that he doesn't even dare to look at it directly.

The street is quiet all day long. The doors of every house are open. The faded commodities are still propping up the facade of every shop, seemingly just out of habit. Passing a few shops, there is always a teahouse, with thick phlegm covering the ground and the half-circle in front of the shop. The tea drinkers sit sparsely. A senile old man sits deep under the parasol tree in front of the eaves, nostalgically dreaming of the emperor's tour. The coarse and spicy tobacco smell spreads into the air. From far away, a woman's voice is calling chickens. A commotion suddenly rises on the street. A sedan chair comes from the east gate, followed by two soldiers with long guns. The officer with a smoky face, looking like a dead foreigner, gets out of the sedan chair, yawns, turns around and enters the Gao2 Inn. The two soldiers take a box off the sedan chair and carry it into the house. The two people who are peeking secretly discuss; they know it is a priceless thing.

There are also shops on this street that are not open. The doors of one or two are always closed. People in yellow uniforms or long robes come in and out from time to time. There are often arguments inside. Once or twice, walking here, I saw two women walking in. From the printed cloth, it can be seen that they are still young. Those red paper-dyed lips, those full bodies, in this stagnant pool, will also be a pile of fire, and will burn something. I know what they do, but I also know that soon a rod-shaped or spherical bacterium will corrode all of this. Youth, in this kind of trade, is very short-lived.

There are also many products around this city, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and silkworm cocoons. Several years ago, this was a salt-producing area, but the salt source was insufficient and artificial fuel was needed. The salt wells have now been shut down. Because of sluggish sales, the mulberry trees that have been around for many years have been cut down as firewood. The people here eat sweet potatoes every day. Wealthy families eat half sweet potatoes and half rice, and difficult families eat a large pot of water and a few pitiful sweet potato sands. The land does not grow enough to feed the people on this land. People are a congenital consuming animal, and this city is becoming cyclically poor.

During the spring ploughing season, a clever gentleman, in order to attract the market north of the city to the east of the city, created a rumor that the Bodhisattva had manifested on the stone wall of the East Mountain. This time, the devout men and women gathered in the East City. In less than a year, a magnificent temple was built on this barren land. The county council also enthusiastically participated in the design and construction. The north of the city was unwilling to show weakness, so a filial son used the ditch water under the stone wall to cure his mother's eye disease. Naturally, the Bodhisattva in the north of the city must also build a temple to enjoy sacrifices. After the devout men and women raised a large amount of donations, the county council, therefore, sold a piece of public land at a high price and resolved to use the proceeds from the sale as travel expenses and office subsidies for the councilors.

The most lively time is, of course, the market; on market days, as soon as it dawns, the winter-style activity preparations begin. The most tense and powerful are the usurers and the tax collectors for various taxes. The restaurant prepares five or six times the dishes. This is a country of food. The hard-working far-comers always don't hesitate to spend thousands or eight hundred to have a full meal after selling a basket of peanuts or silkworm cocoons. Although wiping the oil from their mouths may be followed by the heaviness in their hearts, this is also regarded as natural by the miserable little people. The market is crowded with people from morning to night. In addition to various local products, you can also find relatively novel things. Northwestern Asian woolen textiles, held by some northerners, can also attract a large group of people. Wandering doctors, fortune tellers with ivory cards, spewing saliva and talking nonsense. A pair of leather shoes is surrounded by many villagers, reluctant to touch them and then walk away. The "masters" who have drunk until their faces are red, with thick necks, speak loudly everywhere, flaunting their power, and the street is always so bustling and bustling, with a constant stream of people... Until evening, everything quiets down again.

Time is ruthless, causing many people to strive to catch up or run! But unconsciously, more people and things are dying, unconsciously dying. Talking about humans from the story of apes may be very bizarre, but in many places, there are many people who are starting to regress to apes from the story of humans, but no one is aware of it. Is it that aging is simply allowed to age? That small city seems like another world. Thinking of those pairs of dead fish-like eyes always brings up a painful memory in my heart.

Maupassant Fakes Death to Avoid Debt by Shou Juan

Assorted Fragments of Viola Gui'an

It seems to be the rule that all men of letters are poor, so even the wise and virtuous Han Changli, a great literary master of his generation, could not avoid writing "An Essay on Sending Away Poverty," which is truly enough to save the day! Perhaps "a scholar is useless in everything" and is destined to have an indissoluble bond with the ghost of poverty? However, poverty among men of letters is not only the case in China, but also in the West. The famous French novelist Maupassant (G. de Maupassant) is one such example. Maupassant wrote hundreds of short stories, all of which were elegant, incisive, and profound, earning him the title of "King of the Short Story." But although his novels were good, he was very poor. In Paris, he shared a small building with a painter. Because they were both extremely bored, they became very compatible and got along well with each other. Maupassant wrote the novels, and the painter provided the illustrations, submitting them to newspapers and magazines in exchange for some manuscript fees to maintain their livelihood. At that time, Maupassant owed a sum of money to a stationery merchant on Latin Street, which he could never pay back. He had agreed on a date, but broke his promise many times. The stationery merchant was an old man who was stingy by nature and had a Jewish style. He had come to the door to demand payment many times, but Maupassant not only had no money to pay him, but also mocked him with his glib tongue, making the old man furious and scolding him before leaving. One day, the old stationery merchant came again in a huff to demand payment, forcing Maupassant to pay, otherwise, he would have to move his furniture to auction it off as collateral. The painter quickly mediated from the side, repeatedly saying kind words and begging for a day's extension, saying that he would borrow money from a sculptor and pay the debt in full, promising not to break his word. The old man finally made a special accommodation and left, muttering to himself. The next morning, the painter went out to borrow money, and Maupassant lay in bed reading a humorous newspaper to relieve his boredom. Suddenly, he heard a burst of footsteps echoing on the stairs. Maupassant was shocked because he was familiar with these footsteps. It was clearly his creditor, the old stationery merchant! At this time, the painter had not been gone for long, and he did not know whether he could borrow the money or not. In order to avoid trouble, an idea suddenly came to mind. He immediately jumped out of bed, took paper and pen, and hurriedly wrote: "Mr. Maupassant died of a sudden illness on the 16th. Please contact Mr. Blanc to settle all outstanding debts." He wrote a false address below. Mr. Blanc was also fictitious. Then, he stuck this piece of paper on the outside of the door, hurried back to bed, and lay stiffly, pretending to be dead. After a while, he heard the old stationery merchant coming up the stairs into the room, panting like a hippopotamus. After a while, he heard him cursing in frustration, dragging his slow footsteps out. Maupassant was relieved and took a breath. Suddenly, he heard a delicate voice calling out to open the door. It was clearly Miss Marie next door, whom he usually loved deeply. So he jumped out of bed, opened the door to greet her, and after teasing each other for a while, Marie said goodbye and left. After a few minutes, he heard light footsteps on the stairs again, just like Marie. Perhaps she had returned because she was reluctant to leave him. He was very happy, and as soon as he heard the sound of knocking on the door, he immediately opened the door to welcome her. Who knew that standing outside the door was not the beautiful Miss Marie, but the hateful old stationery merchant? It turned out that he knew that Maupassant's sudden death was a delaying tactic, so he rushed back again, took off his leather boots, and went upstairs barefoot, so Maupassant mistook him for Marie. He could no longer get rid of the old man and had to wait bitterly for the painter to return. That day, he finally paid off the borrowed money and overcame the difficulties.

An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Freedom by Ye Jingfeng

We have two public matters to discuss: First, our team, under the name given by the First Team Leader of Beiping, is called the Special Operations Team. We have to handle both intelligence and guerrilla warfare. Our team will be the First Detachment, with the captain and deputy captain likely holding the rank of lieutenant. The rest of the brothers are all sergeant majors, sergeants, and corporals. Once the list is submitted, official orders will be issued, so we don't have to worry.

"The important thing is, how do you think we should get this group on the road? - Originally, we only planned for a dozen or twenty people - If we take the train, even if our village has a way, but the number is too large, forty or fifty people, we can only get to Jinzhou at most, and it will be difficult to go south from there.... What do you think?" Yaoqun gave Laolong the first action topic.

"Responding to the team leader, sir," Laolong changed his address to Yaoqun: "You are knowledgeable and experienced. As long as you give the order, our brothers can do whatever it takes.... Just say there are many people, we can divide into four or five groups and deal with it.... Or, "Eight Immortals cross the sea, each showing their own skills," let's all go our own way... What do you think, sir?"

"It's not okay for everyone to go their own way." Yaoqun rejected Laolong's proposal. "Isn't this a tricky problem?... Let me carefully consider it and discuss it with Fifth Master later..."

"Team leader, sir," Laolong saw that Yaoqun was in trouble and was pondering, so he made another suggestion: "Or, you can set off as you originally planned, with the deputy team leader. You only need to designate a location and set a date. You don't need to worry about how to get there. Our brothers will find a way... What do you think?"

"The location is Zhangbei or Zhangjiakou, and the date depends on which road we take. The faster the better, we can't fly..." Yaoqun said the word "fly," and his eyes lit up, as if he had an idea: "I think it's easy to get noticed if our team goes together; if we disperse, we're afraid we won't be able to take care of each other. But there is a way to go, it's just a bit harder - you and Wu Erye lead the brothers, dressed as coal mining workers as usual, first take the train to Jin County, then change the train to Lingyuan, where there are long-distance buses, first to Chengde, and then see how things go..."

"Okay, team leader, sir, we can't do other things, but we can walk. You can rest assured!" Laolong said to this point, and after a moment of pondering; "But each person's personal 'gear':"?

"Don't bring it, you can't get through even if you bring it, it's a pity to throw it away." Yaoqun said very decisively: "When we get to the location, I have a way."

"Okay..." Laolong breathed a sigh of relief: "In that case, please take care, sir, you don't need to worry about everything. Our team is sure to arrive at the location in five to seven days - let's say we decide on Zhangbei!" Laolong seemed very confident.

Yaoqun listened to Laolong's words, although he wasn't sure what he was up to, but when he recalled his usual resourcefulness and credibility, he readily accepted his request:

"But tonight I have to set off with Tiger. You have to trouble you with everything else. If no special accidents occur, I will definitely arrive in Zhangbei on the seventh or eighth of next month... The secret code is still the same as the ones used here. Regarding the road and food, I have already discussed it with Fifth Master. You can plan a little more generously and give Fifth Master a list of numbers, that's fine. We can rather overestimate and use sparingly..."

Free Talk The Red Spy Network by Thomas M. Johnson, translated by Wang Qijie

The world's largest spy network is spreading across the United States, and that is the Soviet spy network. They are using various methods to steal military and political information, scientific inventions, and anything else that is beneficial to Russia.

The United States has also been forced to adopt counter-espionage organizations. Recently, three people were actually murdered by Russians. Russian spies in the United States are mostly aided by the American Communist Party and Russian-controlled countries in the United States, such as Czech, Hungary, Austria, South, Bulgaria, and other overseas Chinese. While the Great War was in progress, Russia had already used the group to form a detective agency. It sent industrial and military delegations to the United States, about three thousand three hundred people, including many experts. They pretended to be lower-level staff to cover up and visit factories, test sites, and bases everywhere. On the one hand, they stole the secrets of the atomic bomb, and on the other hand, they said that we should not keep the atomic bomb secret.

Every spy has received high-level training and has knowledge of the army, navy, air force, industry, and diplomacy. The famous NKVD (Russian Secret Service) - now renamed MRVD - has expanded its organization in the United States, and there are cells everywhere. During the war, this type of unit had about ten locations in Canada, and in the United States, I am afraid there were no fewer than fifty. Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York all have more than one location each, and Washington may have ten.

Statistics from March of this year show that Russia has 3,696 employees working in the United States, and another 143 working at the United Nations. However, the United States has only 210 representatives in the Soviet Union.

The head of the spy network is often changed, one to confuse outsiders, and the other to allow a majority of spies to understand the situation in the United States. Some have the qualifications of Soviet representatives, while others forge passports and use false names. Some people were even taken by the Russian government from German prisoners of war and forced to become spies. These people can speak several languages and have lived in the United States, so they are often successful.

This work in the Communist Party is guided by: C.L. Reps" (Communist International Representatives). Among them are conspirators of various races, using various aliases. Their words are like holy edicts to the American Communists. Every official spy has at least ten people working with him, like the regular army doing guerrilla warfare, waiting for important tasks to go on assignments. They are often officials in the government using false names.

In addition to the regular spy network, there are also those who carry out special missions, such as assassinations, kidnappings, etc. Their leader is the Soviet Union's Minister of Internal Affairs, Beria. Beria is one of the members of the Politburo and maintains regular personal contact with Stalin. He can meet with Shi alone.

There are still many unsolved cases in the United States, and they are probably all related to these questions. For example, the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico City (Trotsky had retired here since he turned against Stalin); the disappearance of American Communist Party leader Poyntz in a New York hotel; the murder of New York anti-communist journalist Teasca; the suicide of Krivisky, etc., and the rain never stops!

Recently, the focus of their activities is to steal the secrets of the atomic bomb. They tried to infiltrate New York. The American counter-espionage agency, the FBI, has discovered documents stolen by them in a New York hotel. These spies ran away. In addition to the atomic bomb, the secrets of the B36 flying fortress are also one of their goals. It is said that this type of aircraft can carry atomic bombs to any place in the world, as well as Arctic combat plans, plans to expand the Panama Canal, etc., all of which are being spied on. It is said that one person has infiltrated a test site in Virginia, but was later discovered because of inconsistent credentials.

The British and American embassies in Moscow are often spied on by them. Next to the desk where the American embassy sends secret telegrams, a Russian wireless eavesdropping device was found behind the wall. Six of the newest microphones were found in the British embassy, ​​but fortunately, no secrets were leaked. The telephones of American embassies and consulates in Russia and its affiliated countries are often eavesdropped on. People from these affiliated countries rely on treaty relationships with the United States and often travel to various parts of the United States, indirectly aiding espionage. Recently, Poland sent a delegation of twenty-one envoys to the United States to discuss the relief of the famine in Poland. We treated them with great hospitality. Unexpectedly, these people spied everywhere and provided many military and industrial secrets to Russia, which is really outrageous. There are also those who do business, who are often the incarnations of spies. For example, Amotorg Trade Corporation has published a commercial guide that details the United States' transportation routes, bridge dangers, factories, and mines, and includes photos. It is very likely to be a guide for future combat bombings. The United States Patent Office guards the patents on inventions with ancient laws. You can buy an explanation of an invention for just two dimes and five cents, and the Russians specialize in buying news from here.

After Marshall took office, in order to prevent leaks, he purged the employees of the State Department, dismissing some and prosecuting others. Each embassy and consulate also sent an expert to be responsible for defense. The counter-espionage organization has also been expanded. However, there are many communists among the American sailors, and they often bring Russians in for secret investigations, suffering no small losses. In short, the American democratic law does not have provisions to prevent them, so many people have recently advocated for amending the law.

Jewish Diamond Merchants in the United

### How to Handle Goods Piled Up in Customs Warehouses - The Export Control Committee is Requesting Instructions

Regarding the previous report that customs authorities would purchase goods stored in customs warehouses without completed import procedures at official prices after the implementation of the new foreign exchange measures, import businesses stated that the goods piled up in customs warehouses were not prohibited items, but were ordered with black market drafts without completing the permit procedures. Furthermore, some of them had also held permits. Those that have been stored for a longer period have reached two or three months, and merchants have already suffered considerable losses, and they urgently hope that the government will have an appropriate handling method. After consultation with relevant agencies such as the Export Control Committee, they have requested instructions from higher authorities, and it is expected that they will be approved and announced in the coming days. As for rumors of official price purchases, merchants would hardly accept such a significant loss, and customs authorities would certainly not implement it without authorization to maintain the government's credibility.

Gold Prices Rise

This week, the price of metal goods has risen by about 10% compared to before. Iron nails have gradually increased, among which American leather belt buckles are the best, rising by about 30% in two weeks.

Ch'ien-p'ieh (a type of cloth). Recently, a batch has been shipped from India, with 500 boxes, totaling 15,000 p'ieh.

### Activities of Exporting Green Tea

Various types of export green tea, which are most favored by Morocco, have been actively promoted to foreign countries by export merchants in this city since last week. Currently, part of it is needed by Morocco, causing the quiet foreign tea market to be revived yesterday and gradually become active. Moreover, this year's local Chen Mei and Lu Zhuang Yuan Xin Da Bang, which have been on the market for quite some time, have both opened for trading. It is estimated that the former was purchased by Jardine Matheson & Co. at more than 600 boxes, priced at 1.4 million yuan per dan (a unit of weight), while the latter was offered by Wing Hing Co., priced at 1.7 million yuan per dan. The market sentiment is still considered stable, and there are only minor changes in other areas.

It is learned that Wuchang and China Tea companies are currently in consultation with cargo owners. As for this year's Qimen black tea, although foreign countries also covet it, the high price makes it less lively, and transactions are still sparse. Only Jardine Matheson & Co. has searched for 33 boxes of particularly high-quality tea, priced at 3 million yuan per dan. For other domestic sales of various patterns, this street and guest groups continue to sell mediocrely, and the market still lacks significant changes.

### Plain Thick Woolen Cloth is Firm and Brisk

The market sentiment for plain thick woolen cloth is quite brisk these days, because the overall inventory in Shanghai is lacking, and various firms in the industry have very little stock. There are no shipments from Hong Kong and Japan, and this factory has no ability to weave it, resulting in limited stock that cannot meet demand. The market continues to prosper, and the trend is much firmer than other types of woolen cloth. Yesterday, thin plain woolen cloth was quoted at 400,000 yuan per yard, thick plain woolen cloth at 500,000 yuan, and yellow-edged plain thick woolen cloth traded at 550,000-600,000 yuan. The market prices of other woolen cloth, such as serge and melton, have risen due to the exchange rate of the US dollar and the imported wool being calculated at market prices.

### After the Restriction on the Import of Cottonwood, the Production of Match Splints Decreases

The splint wood required by China's match industry has been mainly imported cottonwood from the United States. Since the authorities have controlled foreign exchange, imports have decreased, resulting in an extreme shortage of cottonwood raw materials. Various splint factories have had to temporarily use domestically produced poplar as a substitute. However, domestic poplar is loose and brittle, and the finished splints are easily broken and scattered. Therefore, in addition to using domestic poplar to manufacture splints for the needs of various match factories as a temporary measure, the splint factories have also requested the association to apply to the authorities for foreign exchange for importing wood.
