### Guling's Scenery Eagerly Awaited by Citizens: Chairman and Madame Chiang Arrive Together, Scheduled for a Brief Ten-Day Respite Before Returning to Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 31st] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, departed Nanjing by special plane at 11:50 AM on the 31st for a brief stay in Guling. Yu Jishi, Cao Shengfen, and others accompanied them. Two attendant aircraft had taken off an hour earlier. Few knew of the Chairman's departure beforehand, and those seeing him off at the aircraft were few. Rumors of Chairman Chiang's trip to Guling had circulated for some time. The Guling summer residence had long been cleaned and prepared, but the Chairman, due to the heavy workload in the capital, was unable to make the trip earlier. Currently, with official duties temporarily lighter, he is going to Guling with his wife to enjoy the refreshing nature of the springs and forests, and to take a brief rest. The stay in Guling is not expected to exceed ten days, as the "Double Ninth Festival" is approaching, and a joint conference of the Party and the Youth League will be presided over by the Chairman.

[Our Nanchang Correspondent, 31st] Chairman Chiang and his wife flew to Nanchang on the afternoon of the 31st and then transferred to Guling, arriving at 2:00 PM. Wang Lingji went to Xun on the morning of the 31st to respectfully greet them.

[Our Guling Correspondent, 31st] Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived at the Shili Pu airport in Xun by special plane at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 31st. The news of the Chairman's arrival was extremely sudden, and people from all walks of life in Guling were unable to rush to the airport to welcome them, only waiting at Lotus Cave. Those present included Director Wu of the Ying Shan Management Bureau, Director Zhang of the Lu Shan Police Bureau, Deputy Commander Du of the Military Police Regiment, and others. After disembarking, the Chairman drove to Lotus Cave, then was carried by sedan chair up the mountain, proceeding along the winding mountain path. The Madame occasionally looked back and inquired of Director Wu about the general situation of Guling. She was particularly concerned about the aftermath of the fire this spring. At 2:50 PM, they arrived at the streets of Guling, where nine thousand citizens gathered excitedly on the streets, some even going to Small Heavenly Pool to welcome them, forming lines and applauding. The Chairman frequently nodded, appearing very pleased. They then went to the Chairman's summer residence at No. 12, Hedong Road, to rest. The Chairman was wearing a yellowish-brown woolen military uniform, and the Madame was in native dress, wearing a large straw hat, looking as elegant as ever. In the afternoon, they strolled on the lawn of the residence. In the evening, they went to Songshu Road to view the Lu Shan moonlight. The weather in the mountains was good today, with no rain, typical of the mid-autumn climate. In the evening, the mountain breeze and pine whispers were especially refreshing. The Chairman changed into a Zhongshan suit, and the Madame added a red wool sweater. They strolled and admired the moon for a long time, returning at 8:00 PM, having enjoyed themselves thoroughly. Furthermore, the Lu Shan Daily is scheduled to publish a special edition tomorrow to welcome the Chairman and Madame's arrival, consisting of a four-page spread. The newspaper's president, Yu Tianwen, and others were working overnight to compile the articles, very busy.

"Central News Agency, Guling, 31st" Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived here at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 31st. After disembarking, the Chairman and Madame immediately boarded a car to Lotus Cave and then ascended the mountain by sedan chair. The Madame's sedan chair preceded the Chairman's. They paused briefly at Jiashan Bing. The Chairman jokingly asked a girl, "How old are you this year?" The girl initially replied eight years old, and then said ten years old. The Chairman alighted from the sedan chair and walked a few dozen steps. The Madame said, "Don't walk, you'll have plenty of walking to do up the mountain later." They then rested again at Guizhu Forest. When the sedan chair passed Tianchi Kou, the Chairman praised the scenery there, turning to his entourage and saying, "This place is very refreshing." Proceeding further, they reached the street entrance of the Guling city area, where the people lined the streets, applauding to welcome them, for they had long awaited the arrival of their head of state. The Chairman frequently nodded, smiling, and said, "Good, good, thank you all!"

### Flour Distributed to Troops of Inferior Quality and Unfit for Consumption: Hebei Provincial Assembly Requests Government Investigation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Control Yuan recently received a report from the Hebei Provincial Assembly stating that over 90,000 bags of general-purpose flour, recently shipped to Ping (Beiping) by the Shanghai Fuxin Flour Mill for military use, were of poor quality and unfit for consumption. After being distributed to various units, the soldiers complained. It was difficult for the various units and the General Directorate of Military Stations to handle the situation. After investigation, it was confirmed to be true. This not only harms the health of the soldiers but also affects military morale, which is of great concern. Therefore, at the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Assembly, a resolution was passed to request the Central Military Comfort Mission to forward the matter to the government for investigation. The Control Yuan believes that this matter is of great importance. In addition to immediately dispatching senior officials to thoroughly investigate, they also expressed the hope that if members of the public have any information about the perpetrators of this corruption and their actions, they should promptly report or secretly inform the Control Yuan so that legal action can be taken.

### The Min and Qing Parties Will Submit Lists of Candidates for Universal Suffrage; The National Congress of the Youth Party Opens This Morning

[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Junli, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, flew from Anshan to Shanghai at 6:00 PM last night. Xu Chuanlin, Dai Yiqiao, Jiang Yuntian, Cui Xinyi and others also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. The Standing Committee, which had been suspended for three weeks, is scheduled to meet this afternoon. At that time, it will review the progress of various routine tasks after the National Congress, and will pass the list of candidates for universal suffrage of the party, submitted to the government.

[Another Report] The 11th National Congress of the Youth Party is scheduled to open at 9:00 AM this morning at the Lido Garden on Taixing Road. More than 200 delegates to the Congress have already reported to Shanghai by yesterday. The chairman of the party, Zeng Qi, and the standing committee members Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, etc., have also arrived in Shanghai from Beijing respectively. In addition to the opening ceremony and the election of the presidium this morning, a memorial service will be held for the late standing committee member Chang Yansheng. A preparatory meeting will be held this afternoon, and the official meeting will be held from tomorrow, with a scheduled duration of ten days.

### All Kinds of Vocational Groups such as Industry and Commerce Will Adjust the Number of Seats in Universal Suffrage

[This Newspaper] According to a business leader who returned to Shanghai from Nanjing: "In the future universal suffrage, the number of representatives among the industrial, commercial, agricultural, and fishery industries will be adjusted to make them more balanced. It is expected that after the adjustment, the number of seats for commercial groups in the Legislative Yuan may increase by five, and the number of seats for National Assembly representatives will also be increased." Regarding the imposition of the Special Construction Contribution, the person believes that the starting point of 5 billion is very reasonable. Because the object of the Construction Contribution is the wealthy, and assets below 5 billion have already been subject to income tax. However, the implementation of the Construction Contribution is quite difficult because China has not conducted property registration in the past. How to implement it properly remains to be carefully planned by the competent authorities.

He said: "The sixth offensive of the Northeast communist bandits speculated by the general public has not yet matured. It is difficult to predict the goal of their next movement. Like silkworms, they have not forgotten Shenyang. However, it is currently the rainy season, and both sides are finding it difficult to move. Most of the main force of the communist bandits is currently concentrated at the Haihekou and Hailong areas. There are also frequent deployments in the Rehe area. The National Army has deployed carefully on all fronts, and the bandits' attempts will surely fail." Zheng flew to Siping on the morning of the 30th to inspect and returned to Shenyang that night.

### The Yalta Secret Agreement Allowed the Soviet Union to Control the Northeast; American Newspapers Criticize Washington's Policy Errors

[This Newspaper Report] London 31st Broadcasting: George, the former chairman of the US Senate Finance Committee, delivered a radio address to leaders of countries around the world, saying: "It is almost impossible for us to expect cooperation from the Soviet Union. The division of Germany and the Soviet Union's control of Northeast China, North China, and Korea are now a fait accompli. The conclusion of the European and Axis peace treaties cannot be delayed too long, and it must be completed as soon as possible regardless of the Soviet Union's views." George believes that the Soviet Union neither needs war nor is prepared to fight, but is only waiting for an opportunity. It is said that George's views on foreign policy often coincide with those of the White House, so his remarks are worthy of attention.

[Central News Agency, New York, 30th] An editorial in the neutral Chicago Daily News recently pointed out that the 1945 Yalta Agreement has made the situation in China more chaotic today, so it must be considered one of the biggest diplomatic mistakes in American history. The clauses in the agreement regarding the Northeast actually allowed the Soviet Union to control North Korea. The newspaper said that Roosevelt then agreed to make China accept these clauses, and the Soviet Union obtained what it wanted from them. Only after the war was won did the Soviet Union participate in the war against Japan for about a week, "China lost the Northeast," and only received empty guarantees of assistance from the United States.

### Presidents of Universities in Shanghai Cable US Authorities Expressing Their Views on Special Envoy Wedemeyer's Statement

[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday, the presidents of various universities in Shanghai jointly cabled US President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, Senate Speaker Vandenberg, Democratic Senator Barkley, House Speaker Martin, and House Democratic Leader Rayburn, expressing their views on the statement made by the Wedemeyer Investigation Mission upon leaving China. The full text of the translated cable is as follows:

The people of our country welcomed the Wedemeyer Investigation Mission to China with great hope, believing that the mission would conduct a practical investigation of the current situation in our country in order to find practical and feasible ways to assist China, because what the general suffering civilians of our country are encountering today is a matter of fact, not a matter of theory.

We, in our capacity as academics and educators, must state that the problem of our country is, in essence, the problem encountered when a long-standing culture suddenly enters the atomic age. The modern situation that Western countries have achieved after centuries may not be understood by outsiders if our country wants to match them all at once.

The Losses Suffered in the Anti-Japanese War Are the Reason for the Deterioration of the Situation

At the beginning of the mission's arrival, it asked government officials the following question: "China made the greatest progress in modern history from 1931 to 1937, but the situation has deteriorated since then. What are the reasons?" This question is extremely important, because the responsible officials in the government in the past few years have all been the responsible officials in the government from 1931 to 1937.

So, what are the reasons for the deterioration of the situation? China had been fighting Japan alone for four and a half years before the Pearl Harbor Incident, and in this eight-year war of resistance, almost all of the country's railways and resource-rich areas fell. This cruel war has led to the universal suffering of material and spiritual deterioration, which is probably unavoidable for any country in the same situation. Moreover, other countries in the United Nations ended their war in 1945, but China is still trapped in war and has not yet been able to rest. Due to the continued expenditure of large amounts of military expenses and the destruction of production capacity, rapid currency inflation is expected. However, are we forced to fight Japan first, and now our country has become a battleground for conflicting world ideologies? Did we bring all of this upon ourselves?

Before Peace and Order Are Restored, It Is Almost Impossible to Seek Improvement

Wei’s departure statement stated that “if the Chinese Communists are sincere, patriotic, and concerned about the welfare of their country, they should voluntarily abandon their efforts to achieve their ideology by force." We dare not have this illusion today. Wei continued: "In order to regain and preserve the faith of the Chinese people, the central government should immediately re-implement strict and far-reaching political and economic reforms." Our government and people should make their best efforts to curb and reverse the tide of deterioration, but we must still frankly admit that there is no possibility of fundamental improvement in the situation until domestic peace and order have been restored. We believe that it is extravagant to seek a solution to our country's difficulties by relying solely on the above recommendations.

People Hope for US Assistance, But It Must Not Harm Dignity and Sovereignty

The traditional friendship between our country and the United States has lasted for a hundred years, and the trust and admiration of the people of our country for the United States is sincere. The reason for this is that the American people have always treated us with impartiality in the past. No matter what significant differences there are between the two countries, they must make every effort to understand our country, and have never thought that only the traditions, habits, customs, and ways of thinking of the American people are divinely ordained.

The people of our country are in serious trouble. They are well aware of their own shortcomings. They hope for American cooperation, and they welcome American assistance to extricate themselves from their current predicament. However, for the sake of the long-standing traditional friendship between China and the United States, if there is such assistance, its conditions must not harm the dignity and sovereignty of the patriotic people of China. President Tu Yuxiang of St. John's University, President Ling Xianyang of Soochow University, President Li Peien of Zhijiang University, President Hu Jiaofu of Datong University, President Hu Wenyao of Aurora University, President Zhu Jingdi of Guanghua University, President Ou Yuanhuai of Great China University, President Junyi of National Fudan University, August 31.

### National Army in Southern Henan Enters Guangshan; Air Force from Hankou Base Deployed to Assist in Battle; Remnants of Liu's Bandits Flee Towards Xuanhuadian

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 31st] The siege of Zhengyang in Southern Henan has been lifted. This afternoon, the National Army capitalized on its victory and entered Guangshan. The National Army from Gushi Yejiaji is pressing towards Shangcheng at full speed. The remaining forces of Liu's bandits, consisting of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, and Independent Brigades, now number less than 20,000. In recent days, Liu's bandits have been lingering in the Guangshan, Shangcheng, and both banks of the Zhugan River areas. This is because Liu's bandits deeply feel the suffering of facing a desperate situation. If they flee en masse into the Dabie Mountain area, the food shortage would be a minor concern, but the lack of ammunition would be fatal. If they flee to the Tongbai Mountains, they could coordinate with the bandits in Western Henan, but crossing the Pinghan Railway to the west would risk the annihilation of the entire army. Liu's bandits will have to choose one of these two options, and Liu's bandits may make a new move within days.

[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 31st] The 1st and 7th Columns of the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces have been defeated by the National Army and reorganized into an independent column, commanding three brigades. On the evening of the 29th, after being tracked and attacked by the National Army, many bandits were killed. The remaining forces are fleeing towards Xuanhuadian. The National Army is in pursuit. Furthermore, a portion of the bandit Independent Brigade east of the road suffered a severe blow at Zhutangdian and has fled in disarray, seemingly returning to its original formation.

[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 31st] The main force of the 3rd Column of bandits, which suffered a disastrous annihilation in Shangcheng, is fleeing southwest and retreated through Fujing. Shangcheng was then recaptured. The bandit suppression troops are pursuing towards Jingfu. The 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns of bandits have retreated into the Dabie Mountains between Henan and Hubei. The center of gravity of the war in Southern Henan has shifted to the foot of the Dabie Mountains. Once blockaded, Liu Bocheng will repeat the fate of Li Xiannian's annihilation.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 30th] More than 3,000 Communist bandits besieged Yiyang on the 30th. As of 5:00 PM on the 31st, the situation there is unclear.

[Central News Agency, Yuanyang, 31st] The Baotuan Hengshui bandit army has been attacking fiercely for days, digging tunnels and launching repeated assaults. On the afternoon of the 29th, they once broke into the town, but over 400 were stabbed to death by the National Army, and they fled in disarray.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 31st] The air force at this base is deployed daily to assist ground troops in combat, in order to impede the southward advance of the Liu Bocheng bandit forces. The results achieved are very significant.

[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, 30th] The Communist bandits who crossed the Yellow River from Western Henan to commit offenses are becoming increasingly rampant. The two counties of Xin'an and Mianchi have completely fallen. The bandits who infiltrated Dingyang captured Cun Duan Village yesterday and crossed the Luo River at 8:00 PM that night, surrounding the outskirts of Dingyang City. The local militia, led by Xu Jisheng, is engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits. The National Army in Luoyang launched an attack on the bandits at Hengshui on the morning of the 30th and engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in the Weizhuang area, 20 li north of Luoyang. It is reported that a brigade commander was killed and many weapons were seized. The bandit headquarters is currently located in Wengong, about 50 li northwest of Luoyang, and has two brigades of troops. Based on the above situation, it has been determined that their crossing of the river this time is indeed intended to establish a new base, as they have claimed. The elders of Western Henan eagerly hope that the main force will advance westward and eliminate the bandit atmosphere.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 31st] The National Army in Western Shandong frequently reports victories in sweeping operations. The remaining forces of the 1st, 3rd, and 8th Columns of the Communist East China Field Army and the Independent Brigade, totaling over 10,000, fled to Rangujiji west of Chengwu and the Qinggujiji, Wangdian, and Tianqiao areas southwest of Ningxian on the 29th. The National Army encircled and suppressed them in multiple routes. After fierce fighting until the evening of the 30th, over 3,000 remaining Communists were killed, and over 500 rifles were captured. Another route of the National Army encircled and annihilated the remaining bandits northwest of Chengwu. In three days, over 4,000 bandits were annihilated, over 1,000 rifles, over 50 heavy machine guns, and over 400 bandits were captured.

Agencies without their own docks and warehousing facilities shall have the Ministry of Communications handle these matters on their behalf, charging the prescribed fees. If the Ministry of Communications' warehousing facilities are insufficient, the Ministry of Communications shall make full use of the surplus capacity of the agencies' own warehouses, charging the appropriate fees.

[Central News Agency, Anshan, 31st] The Anshan Iron and Steel Works, which had been destroyed twice, has now embarked on the road to revival. Since August 6th, it has begun to produce 200 tons of steel per day. The 400-ton ironmaking furnace can also begin its ironmaking work by the end of September. With the iron and steel works as the parent body, more than 30 large-scale subsidiary factories, such as casting and steel pipe factories, have successively resumed work. The development of all of China's heavy industry will also take a giant step forward with the revival of Anshan. The reporter recently accompanied Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee, to inspect the factory. Inside the factory, the sound of machines operating was deafening, and the flames in the steelmaking furnaces were dazzling. In particular, the steel bars rolled by the various rolling mills were like countless fiery snakes dancing wildly across the ground, which was a remarkable sight inside the factory. The ingenious coordination of various machines, the skilled techniques of the workers, and the speed with which products were manufactured made people believe that a strong country must rely on industry. When the reporter arrived in Anshan from Shenyang, he saw countless chimneys piercing the sky, and large and small factories stretched for dozens of miles. No wonder the enemy and puppet regimes often praised it as the "Iron Capital." This Anshan, which had been quiet and deserted for many days, has finally been restored to its smoky state in the hands of the Taiwanese. Currently, the departments of the iron and steel works that have started work include more than 30 manufacturing factories for coking, steelmaking, rolling steel, casting steel, steel pipes, iron towers, wire ropes, rails, steel wheels, and bridges. By the end of September, after the ironmaking furnace is ignited, the entire continuous operation of the past steel works can be completed. According to a certain general manager, next year, it can produce 80,000 tons of steel and 120,000 tons of iron. In the following year, it can produce 420,000 tons of iron and steel. Five years later, it can produce one million tons per year. However, the completion of this plan must rely on two conditions: stability and funding. Over the past two days, the reporter has traveled throughout the various factories in Anshan and seen that most of the Japanese technicians and workers have been sent back to their countries. Currently, all machines are operated entirely by Chinese people, and the working morale is excellent. When asked about their working conditions, most of them said, "When the Japanese were here, they wouldn't let us do this, at most they would only let us be coolies for them." Although Anshan's steel production is not unique in the world, the production of various other factories in coordination in one place is still the first in the world. Anshan's iron and steel and Fushun's coal mines constitute the main conditions for "Industrial Northeast."

### Yu Dawei Discusses Improving Postal and Telecommunications Services

### On the Red Stage in Warsaw, Figures Are Jumping; Fourth Letter from Poland

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Mao Shuqing

If we say that the Communist Parties all over the world use the same method to seize their political power, then another question that interests me in Warsaw should be: Who exactly is the Stalin of Poland? The Tito of Poland?

President Bierut is the number one veteran Communist in Poland, but Bierut does not have "power." People in the Polish government say: Bierut is a good guy, a revolutionary hero with "great magnanimity." In the later period of World War II, Bierut had sharp struggles with the "London government-in-exile," but the person standing behind the scenes to give Bierut ideas was Gomulka, now the Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party, a gloomy, intelligent, 42-year-old middle-aged man.

The Polish people now all know Gomulka. Rather than "know," it is better to say "fear." During the few days I stayed in Warsaw, I talked about the general situation of the world with many Polish young people. When they talked about Gomulka, they had to look back and around to see if there were any spies "leaking military secrets." They said: Gomulka's opinions can now largely influence the "Central Politburo" of the Communist Party. He often "purges" the party, not only purging the Communist Party itself, but also purging the Polish Socialist Party.

This spring, Gomulka launched a "Party Merger Movement," which was strongly opposed by the two parties. It is said that the main reason for the Socialist Party's opposition was because the "right-wing" was manipulating it.

This is the origin of the Socialist Party's "purge." During the few days I was in Warsaw, it was a citywide sensation that Gella and many others were imprisoned and were being tried by Poland's special law for "treason." At a press conference for foreign reporters, Grochowski, Director of the International Propaganda Department, reported that these people from several countries were guilty of: being anti-Soviet, opposing the current government, and engaging in trampling and underground activities.

The Polish people call these people, the right-wing of the Socialist Party, wRN. I asked Director Grochowski to explain in detail the historical roots and nature of the so-called wRN, and their political propositions. Grochowski's answer was: They belong to the right-wing of the Polish Socialist Party. The Polish Socialist Party has had more than 50 years of glorious history, but this wRN faction are all stubborn and reactionary elements. The Soviets helped Poland liberate itself from the iron hooves of the Nazis, but these people insisted on being "anti-Soviet." Therefore, in the year the Lublin Revolutionary Government was established, wRN was declared an illegal political organization. Gella is one of the main figures.

An American reporter asked at the press conference: How can a political group with political propositions be called legal? How can it be called illegal? Is it because it is anti-Soviet that it is determined to be "illegal"? The atmosphere at the press conference at that time was quite tense. The reporter from TASS smoked a Russian cigar and pretended to be silent. Director Grochowski thought for a moment. He replied very cleverly: Of course, there are legal and illegal parties. For example, "Your country (referring to the United States) has a group called the Ku Klux Klan, which has many people and a lot of activity, but your country's laws stipulate that any activity of the Ku Klux Klan is illegal. Poland's wRN is the same!"

I have asked many Polish people in Warsaw and know that the main members of wRN are all people who have come from the London government-in-exile, and many are now disgraced figures. Their party platform clearly states that Poland has two major enemies, one is Nazi fascism and the other is Soviet Russia with red terror.

On the day Gella was tried, the government newspaper of the Socialist Party wrote an article called "The Path of the Polish Socialist Party in the Future," which was like a declaration, mentioning strengthening the friendly relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, eliminating stubborn elements within the party, and "tendencies to court capitalism."

This article should be regarded as the official expression of the Socialist Party. In fact, the Socialist Party after World War II is a common phenomenon in Europe. In the dispatches I wrote in France, I specially recommended the old ancestor of the Socialist Party, Leon Blum. Leon Blum is the name of a person, but also a symbol between liberalism and totalitarianism; capitalism and communism. When the contradiction between the two is not manifested, when the sharp relationship between the two has not yet exploded, this symbol can play the role of a "bridge" in any country in Europe. The bridge allowed France to squeeze into the ranks of the "Big Four" and made the relationship between Western Europe and Eastern Europe temporarily stable!

However, from the Truman Doctrine to the division of East and West Europe at the Paris Conference, the bridging role of the Socialist Party is collapsing day by day. Remaury in Paris actually drove the Communist Party out of the cabinet, and the Communist Party in Warsaw can naturally arrest and detain wRN. Former Polish Prime Minister Osumo-Muleski, because he does not agree with the two-party merger movement, will no longer play a role in the Socialist Party. The current "bald" Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz is said to be a person who is considered quite satisfactory by the Communist Party. At least, in Gomulka's eyes, Cyrankiewicz is a backbone of the Socialist Party who will never oppose the Soviet Union.

I have met with Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, but have not met with Gomulka. Gomulka is the "Deputy Prime Minister" and Minister of the Recovered Territories in the central government, but these official titles are far less important than the Secretary-General of the Communist Party. On the third day of my arrival in Warsaw, I asked Anna Krystof, Ms. Wiesvol of the International Propaganda Department, to arrange a "private interview" with Gomulka. She contacted me for two days and asked me to see Mr. Tuski, Gomulka's private secretary first.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party is located at 17 Stalin Street, opposite the British Embassy, a rather majestic building in Warsaw. The strict security of the red headquarters surprised me. The first step was to check the passport photo at a window like a "ticket office," and then I was given an entry permit with a thick red diagonal line. After passing the inspection of two guards with "panda guns" on their backs, I was told to go upstairs. After being questioned by the three secretaries of the reception room, especially the issue of my newspaper's position and its relationship with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party? I told them: "Shen Bao is the oldest newspaper in China. Shen Bao existed long before the founding of the Republic of China. Shen Bao has always been an independent newspaper and is not the organ of any party." The secretaries seemed very satisfied after listening, but said: "Mr. Tuski is very busy and may not be able to meet today." At that time, I really couldn't restrain myself anymore. I said: "I am a foreign reporter. I originally asked the International Propaganda Department to introduce me to Mr. Gomulka. Because Mr. Gomulka is very busy, it was agreed that I would come to see Mr. Tuski first today!" The secretaries looked surprised, and their faces seemed to say, "You are worthy to meet our Secretary-General!" (To be continued)

### Aid Needed Urgently for Out-of-School Youth: Hopes for Promotion of Scholarship Assistance in Various Regions - Remarks from the Person in Charge of the Youth Re-enrollment Counseling Committee

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Since the promotion of scholarship assistance movements in various regions such as Beijing and Shanghai, they have been met with considerable sympathy and support from people in society. Today, this reporter visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Education's "Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Counseling Committee" to inquire about their views on this movement. They agreed to give the following statement: "The current semester has already begun, and students in various regions are either out of school due to their homes being in bandit-occupied areas or suffering from floods. They feel the difficulty of attending school. Even impoverished students who were originally studying at various schools are finding it nearly impossible to continue their studies due to soaring prices and excessive school fees, and are on the verge of falling back into a state of being out of school. The government's finances are difficult, and this committee is limited by its approved budget and unable to provide special subsidies to impoverished students. However, we deeply feel that the seriousness of this problem is growing and cannot be ignored. We previously issued a notice to all subordinate units, urging them to contact people and organizations in society who care about young people to establish relief service organizations for impoverished students, in order to supplement the government's efforts. In the past six months, no fewer than 150,000 young people have received assistance. Now, Beijing, Shanghai, and other regions are launching scholarship assistance movements, which are worthy of expanded promotion. Other provinces and cities also have people with strength and sympathy for students, but due to a lack of leadership, they have been unable to launch and demonstrate benevolent actions. This committee has recently telegraphed the counseling offices in various provinces and cities again, ordering them to quickly contact all sectors to launch scholarship assistance movements, expand publicity to all sectors of society, solicit scholarship funds, and encourage students to serve society, in order to help themselves and others complete their studies and become useful to the country. This will also be listed as one of the achievements of each counseling office. We sincerely hope that people in society and the press will provide more promotion and assistance, which will greatly benefit young people."

### New Perspectives on Urban Design: Liang Sicheng Lectures in Beiping

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 31st] Renowned architect and director of the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University, Liang Sicheng, lectured on new perspectives on urban design at the Beiping Engineering Society today. Mr. Liang is a consultant to the design committee for the United Nations headquarters building and recently returned from the United States. Mr. Liang advocates that the design of urban construction should create forms based on people's lifestyles, rather than conforming to existing forms. He believes that urban construction should not focus on the appearance of the city, but on the lives of the people. If people's lives are improved, the city will naturally reach a satisfactory state. Mr. Liang also said that the United Nations is limited by its location, and the design is quite difficult. The forty-story building on this small plot includes offices for 5,500 people, a large assembly hall, five types of council chambers, eighteen types of committee chambers, and offices for national representatives and affiliated organizations. The assembly hall must accommodate 3,500 representatives plus 1,500 journalists and audience members. Attention must be paid to technical issues such as ensuring that the entry and exit of the audience does not interfere with the meeting, and that journalists can report from the venue.

Editorial

### Thoughts on Journalists' Day

September 1st, Journalists' Day, is our own holiday as newspaper people, and it is an excellent opportunity for us to conduct a self-examination once a year.

China's news industry has always been considered backward. Whether in terms of content or technology, compared to the advanced countries in the newspaper industry, we are far behind. However, during the War of Resistance, after eight years of hard work by newspaper people across the country, we have made considerable progress. Although the appearance of Chinese newspapers is still difficult to fully express the characteristics of modern newspapers due to a lack of material conditions, in terms of content, we have been able to achieve the effects of modern newspapers on politics, economy, society, and culture to some extent. We can not only reflect public opinion and serve as the mouthpiece of the people, but also report accurate news in the fastest way, becoming an indispensable spiritual food for intellectuals. However, in any case, the Chinese newspaper industry is still backward. And broadly speaking, the Chinese newspaper industry is developing according to the principles of capitalism, following the path of Britain and the United States. But looking at the state of the newspaper industry in various countries around the world, there are clearly two new trends.

The first is the international movement for freedom of the press. Countries around the world are now demanding international freedom of the press. During the war, enlightened people in various countries, after the painful lessons of this war, all believed that the root of the war lay in the secrecy and disguise of international news before the war. If we want to create world peace after the war and hope that it can be maintained for a long time, we must seek international freedom of the press. Any current journalist can freely interview news in any country in the world, without any restrictions, freely transmit news, without any interference from the local authorities, and can publish freely, without any form of censorship. This is truly a landmark international movement. Apart from the Soviet Union, most other countries have joined. If all countries can do it without reservation, it can not only be regarded as a peace movement, but also a major innovation movement in the press.

The second is the domestic movement for freedom of speech. Peace-loving people generally believe that if the post-war world is to enter a new era of peace and democracy, freedom of speech within each country is also an indispensable condition. Freedom of speech is the life of democratic politics. A country without freedom of speech has no democracy to speak of. If political facilities do not allow people to freely express critical opinions, there will be no progress in politics. Apart from the parliament of democratic countries, newspapers are the only tool for expressing public opinion. Therefore, countries around the world are demanding domestic freedom of speech after the war.

China's newspaper industry has been stimulated by international trends and is moving towards these two goals. In recent years, through the continuous efforts of Chinese newspaper people, considerable achievements have been made in both the international movement for freedom of the press and the domestic movement for freedom of speech. But so-called freedom is by no means a matter of allowing us reporters to break through barriers and do whatever we want. As the ancients said, "One word can make a country prosper, and one word can make a country perish." Isn't it the same today? A reporter's pen is not only related to the honor and disgrace of the country and the safety of the world, but also the fate of mankind is tied to the hands of newspaper people. Democratic countries attach importance to public opinion, and any policy is based on the support of public opinion. The greater the responsibility of newspaper people, the more difficult it is for newspaper people to make good use of their freedom. Therefore, we must ask the government to pay special attention to news education for cultivating journalistic talent.

### What Will the United States Do About China?

The presidents of various universities in Shanghai yesterday jointly telegraphed the U.S. authorities, commenting on the statement issued by Special Envoy Wedemeyer upon leaving China, and expressing their views, welcoming U.S. cooperation, but for the sake of the permanent friendship between China and the United States, if the United States provides aid to China, it should respect the dignity and sovereignty of the Chinese people who have self-esteem. The full text of this telegram is couched in tactful language, with serious and just meaning, and is neither arrogant nor humble. It can indeed express the true intentions of the Chinese people. After reading this telegram, we would also like to reiterate our feelings.

Special Envoy Wedemeyer's investigation in China this time, traveling all over the place, lasted for a month. It is doubtful whether he has exhausted his ability to "visit widely and consult broadly." The presidents of various universities in Shanghai are predecessors engaged in cultural and educational work in our country and hold leading positions in society. Their opinions should be valued by the U.S. government and the public. But how many presidents did Special Envoy Wedemeyer meet during his three visits to Shanghai, and did he inquire about the opinions of these scholars? Since they had no opportunity to directly inform Special Envoy Wedemeyer of their opinions, they naturally had no choice but to frankly express themselves to the U.S. authorities. The United States is a democratic country, and all policies are based on the support of public opinion. The opinions of the presidents of various universities in Shanghai can represent the opinions of the majority of intellectuals in Shanghai, and can not only serve as important information for Special Envoy Wedemeyer's report, but also for President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and members of Congress to study their policy towards China.

Now that the telegram from the presidents of various universities in Shanghai has been published, what are the feelings of cultural and educational figures in other places, as well as leaders from other sectors in Shanghai, after reading Special Envoy Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China? What supervision do they have over the government, and what expectations do they have for the United States? It seems that they will not remain silent. Politics is a matter for all people, and democratic politics especially requires respect for the opinions that can truly represent the majority of people. The overall situation of the country has reached a critical juncture. If people in society are still indifferent, as if the people of Qin regarded the fatness or thinness of the people of Yue, that would be truly strange!

The telegram from the presidents of various universities says, "We were forced to fight Japan before other countries, and our country has become a battleground for ideological conflicts. How can we bring this suffering upon ourselves?" This point not only implies the international factors behind the Chinese war, but it is also too subtle. We believe that there is still a need for supplementation.

We believe that Special Envoy Wedemeyer's biggest oversight in investigating the facts this time was his failure to pay attention to the international factors behind the Chinese war and the important position of China in the Far East. As Chinese historian Fu Sinian said, "When Special Envoy Wedemeyer was measuring the Chinese situation, he did not fully recognize that China should take action in the East to oppose communism and pay attention to the Soviet Union." Frankly speaking, the United States should bear its moral responsibility for the development of the Far Eastern situation to this point. Former President of Zhongzheng University, Hu Xiansu, said that the United States "actually violated the Cairo Conference declaration and privately concluded the Yalta Agreement with the Soviet Union, selling out China." This view is also shared in the U.S. public opinion circle. For example, the neutral Chicago Daily News published an editorial the day before yesterday, pointing out that the Yalta Agreement has made the Chinese situation even more chaotic today, so it cannot but be regarded as the biggest diplomatic mistake in American history. If the Chinese Communists did not have the support of the Soviet Union, they could have been resolved long ago. As for China, it had already engaged in a life-and-death battle with the Japanese warlords when the United States was loudly advocating the "Neutrality Act," blocking the realization of Japan's dream of conquering Asia and conquering the world on the front line, resulting in eight years of protracted war and exhaustion. And now, with the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union evolving into a division of the world, China is once again caught in between. Therefore, U.S. aid to China should actually be regarded as part of the U.S. world policy.

In short, the relations between China and the United States are facing a new test. The situation in the Far East and even the world is also changing dramatically. Whether for the sake of peace in the Far East or for the sake of U.S. interests, the U.S. Far East policy cannot allow the United States to make another diplomatic mistake!

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st] The Soviet Union submitted a memorandum on August 29th in response to the U.S. note of August 13th urging it to participate in the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty, insisting that the Japanese peace treaty should first be preliminarily worked on by the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The memorandum believes that China is a member of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, so there is even more reason for the Japanese peace treaty to be decided first by the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

[Reuters, London, 31st] The Soviet Union stated today that it does not intend to participate in the eleven-nation conference on the Japanese peace treaty, nor does it intend to sign the treaty drafted by this conference, and is only willing to sign the treaty drafted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Soviet Professor Li Ming declared on the Moscow Radio's weekly English broadcast program: The U.S. proposal to convene the eleven-nation Japanese peace treaty conference violates the Potsdam Agreement, and all preliminary details of the peace treaty should be drafted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Soviet Union does not recognize such conferences and does not intend to send personnel to participate. The Soviet Union also does not intend to sign the treaty drafted by this conference, and hopes that the United States will pay attention to this. Concluding a peace treaty with Japan while a state of war still exists between the Soviet Union and Japan is, technically speaking, truly a comedy. As for the so-called British Commonwealth Japanese peace treaty conference held in Canberra, I truly do not understand what achievements they hope to have, considering that the dictator of Japan, MacArthur, is willing to seriously consider the suggestions of this conference. No matter how long such methods can delay the Japanese peace treaty, the Soviet Union feels that it can only recognize the Foreign Ministers' Conference as the only body for drafting the Japanese peace treaty, which is our final position.

[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] It was learned today that the Australian delegation and the U.S. government have repeatedly consulted on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty, and opinions have conflicted. The Australian side insists that the Japanese peace treaty should provide a guarantee of long-term occupation of Japan, while the U.S. side intends to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in Japan within the next two years. An Australian official recently told reporters that Japan has a population of 80 million, while Australia has only 8 million, a huge difference. The United States initially advocated occupying Germany for 25 years, but now intends to withdraw from Japan within two years. The policies are inconsistent. It is believed that the Japanese are now waiting for an opportunity to prepare to regain control of the Far East. If this unfortunate prediction comes true, the fate of Australia is unimaginable. The U.S. policy is unknowingly placing Japan in the same advantageous position as Germany in 1920, but as a result, Germany was able to gradually recover, causing World War II. The lesson is not far away, so be careful not to repeat it.

### Representatives of British Commonwealth Conference Express Opposition to U.S. Loans to Japan, but Support Allowing Japan's Economy to Achieve Independence

[Reuters, Canberra, 30th] During private conversations, representatives attending the British Commonwealth Japanese peace treaty conference expressed strong opposition to the proposal, reported by authoritative sources, that MacArthur's headquarters is preparing to recommend that Japan receive loans of $500 million to develop its foreign trade. It is said that MacArthur's headquarters' suggestion is to use Japan's gold and silver as collateral for the loans, and Japanese traders in allied and neutral countries can apply to use this loan. Although the British Commonwealth conference has not formally discussed this suggestion, the representatives believe that although the Allied countries should allow the Japanese economy to achieve independence, the loans suggested by MacArthur's headquarters are not supported by the Commonwealth countries.

### The Japanese Cannot Be Trusted: Views of the British Army Commander

[Associated Press, Sydney, 31st] The Sydney "Sunday Sun" reported from Canberra on the 31st that Lieutenant General Robertson, commander of the British occupation forces in Japan, warned at the British Commonwealth conference, "We cannot trust the Japanese and should pay attention to the Japanese's superficial cooperation, as their sincerity is ultimately questionable." It is said that apart from Robertson's direct comments on Japan, there have been no official announcements on this matter at the conference in the past week. Some representatives fear that the United States may have been deceived by the Japanese.

### France's Economic Difficulties: Plans to Request Assistance from the United States

[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] According to reliable sources tonight, France's shortage of U.S. dollars is so serious that it may have to request assistance from the United States before the Marshall Plan is submitted to the U.S. Congress for discussion. The French cabinet also informed the nation today that the country is impoverished, that the people's hard work and endurance may have to continue for ten years, and that it is necessary to tighten their belts and get through the difficult times. The economic austerity plan stipulates that purchases of coal, kerosene, and food in the U.S. dollar trading area must be reduced by $293 million within the year.

### Britain to Cut Military: Reduce to One Million by March Next Year

[Associated Press, London, 30th] The Associated Press has learned that one of the ways the British Labour government is dealing with the current crisis is to reduce British military strength to less than one million within six months. British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery, who was in France inspecting the French army, flew back to London on the 30th to hold emergency talks to reduce the missions of British troops at home and abroad. British industry urgently needs manpower and military spending is strained, so the British government is said to have planned to withdraw troops stationed in Italy and Greece, reduce or withdraw British troops in Palestine, and reduce the occupation forces in Germany before March next year, while drastically shrinking British domestic defense.

### Important Japanese War Criminals - Unconditional Release

Including Former Governor-General of Taiwan, Kobayashi, and Others

[United Press International, Tokyo, 31st] Five former Japanese cabinet members, including a navy admiral, an army general, and a financial magnate, along with ten other major war criminals who have not yet been tried, were released from Sugamo Prison on the 30th. While the Allied Headquarters has not yet provided an explanation, Japanese sources claim that many of these suspects have been imprisoned for over a year. The reason for their release is that their suspicion of being war criminals has been temporarily cleared.

According to Japanese sources, when these individuals were released at noon on the 30th, they themselves were quite suspicious, asking the prison authorities, "Is this true?" Upon returning home after their release, their families were also skeptical for a long time. Those released include Yoshisuke Ayukawa, former director of the Manchurian Industrial Development Company; Admiral Sozo Kobayashi, former Governor-General of Taiwan; General Masaki, former military councilor; Shozo Murata, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and Railways in the Konoe Cabinet; Tatsuo Ohta, Minister of Home Affairs in the Tojo Cabinet; Asada, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Abe Cabinet from 1939 to 1940; Matsuzaki, Minister of Justice in the Tojo Cabinet; and Okabe, Minister of Education in the Tojo Cabinet.

The political representatives currently stationed in these countries will be replaced by formal diplomatic envoys. Bidault happily stated, "Thursday will be one of the most pleasant days for Europe. On this difficult road to peace, we have at least seen the emergence of hope."

### On-the-Spot Observation of Vietnam

— Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang, Saigon Air Mail

Amidst the sounds of Viet Minh-thrown grenades, French machine guns, and the popping of Saigon champagne bottles, the death knell of French colonial imperialism has already been heard. In Saigon, the sound of Viet Minh special agents' grenades exploding is almost as common as the popping of champagne bottles. In this symphony, Asian nations have risen up, fighting for civil rights and freedom. One can observe the ethnic unrest occurring throughout Southeast Asia by examining Vietnam; the motives vary, and whether those motives are pure seems unnecessary to ask. But it is a clear fact that this type of ethnic unrest has succeeded throughout Southeast Asia.

The conflict between the Viet Minh and France has brought French Indochina, the richest of the French colonies, to the brink of bankruptcy. Before the war, French Indochina exported about 1.5 million tons of rice annually; today, if it can export 100,000 tons, France is considered very fortunate. Vietnamese rice used to be shipped abroad via Saigon, but due to the impact of Viet Minh guerrilla warfare, this rice export has been almost entirely cut off. Even if a small amount of rice can get past the guerrillas and reach Saigon's rice mills, those mills are often set on fire by Viet Minh special agents. If the rice has already been milled, these agents will find a way to sink the rice-transporting ships. Recently, six French ships sailed to Saigon to load rice, but ended up leaving without a single grain.

Overseas Chinese in Vietnam have suffered heavy losses due to the war and unrest. Most of the rice mills there are run by overseas Chinese, and most of them have now been shut down, at a loss and with no prospect but to await the restoration of peace.

The situation of rubber plantations in Vietnam also illustrates how the Viet Minh's scorched-earth policy can destroy the French colonial economy. Before the war, Vietnam exported about 100,000 tons of rubber to France and the United States annually; since the outbreak of the French-Vietnamese war, rubber production has almost completely ceased. The Viet Minh guerrillas have adopted a scorched-earth policy and have damaged most of the rubber plantations. According to an estimate by a certain authority, only about 60% of the rubber plantations are currently planted, and only 21% of them are producing rubber. The maximum amount of rubber that the French can export this year is 25,000 tons. Experts estimate that it will take about ten years to restore the rubber plantations destroyed by the Viet Minh. A week before the reporters arrived in Saigon, four French planters were killed by Viet Minh special agents in one of Vietnam's largest rubber plantations, even though it was guarded by French soldiers. After this incident, French rubber planters were reluctant to go to Vietnam to work.

The impending bankruptcy of the French colonial economy is also due to the decline in Vietnam's coal production. Before the war, French Indochina produced about 200,000 to 300,000 tons of coal annually, some of which was exported (a large amount of this Tokyo coal was regularly shipped to Shanghai before the war). But currently, the coal produced by Vietnamese coal mines is only 10% to 15% of pre-war levels.

In order to maintain Vietnam's economic lifeline, the French have implemented various strict controls on exports and foreign exchange. Although the exchange rate between the Vietnamese currency and the US dollar is set at a ratio of seven to one, the black market exchange rate is 35 Vietnamese currency units to one US dollar. Foreign exchange is only approved for essential goods that Vietnam lacks, so that most daily necessities cannot be obtained in Vietnam.

The person behind this major social and economic change in Vietnam is Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh. Ho has been seen as colluding with the communists, but he vehemently denies any direct or indirect relationship with the Communist Party. When meeting Chinese guests, Ho often holds a copy of the "Three Principles of the People" to show that he is a follower of the Nationalist doctrine. However, it is known that his Minister of Education is a Chinese Communist Party member trained in the Communist area. It is too early to judge what contributions Ho has made to improving the living standards of the Vietnamese people, or how much freedom he can give to the Vietnamese people who have been ruled by the French colonial government for the past fifty years.

In the French-Vietnamese conflict, overseas Chinese suffer collateral damage. Overseas Chinese live throughout Vietnam, and in Saigon alone, there are 600,000 overseas Chinese, most of whom live in the area of ​​Cholon. Among the overseas Chinese, many are wealthy merchants with huge economic interests, but most are small businessmen and farmers with a very low level of education. Due to postal delays and a lack of transportation, they have very little contact with their homeland in normal times. There is a very important plan that our government should implement immediately, which is to improve the education level of overseas Chinese in Vietnam and establish modern transportation routes, such as the air transport service designed by China National Aviation Corporation. Once this air route is opened, it can be asserted that overseas Chinese in Vietnam will have closer ties with their homeland.

In general, most overseas Chinese in Vietnam pay little attention to the development of the political situation in China. Although locals sometimes discuss the various political activities of the Democratic League, the Communist Party, and the Kuomintang, most overseas Chinese are mostly preoccupied with making a living.

In April of this year, the communist newspaper "Vietnam Daily" was banned from publication after insulting Chairman Chiang, following a request from Chinese Consul General Yin Fengzao. At the moment, the Communist Party is publishing an underground publication called "New Sprout". At present, the power of the Vietnam Democratic League is still limited and it is gradually developing.

During the reporters' stay in Saigon, they were warmly welcomed by the local overseas Chinese, who expressed a strong desire to have closer ties with their homeland after China National Aviation Corporation opened a direct air route. Saigon Consul General and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Hong Qingliang held a grand tea party to welcome all the personnel of China National Aviation Corporation. (August 25th)

### Attempted Suicide Saved - Crime Discovered - Forged Seals to Illegally Obtain Goods - Despair from Empty Pockets Leads to Suicide Attempt

[Our Newspaper] Xue Zhonglin established the Kaitai Paint Shop on Fujian Road, and his brother, Xue Yiqing, also known as Wenqu, assisted in disaster relief work. Yiqing took advantage of his professional convenience to continuously engage in fraud, amounting to more than 40 million yuan. His elder brother, Bolin, repeatedly advised him in vain, and published a notice to sever the fraternal relationship. In May, Yiqing became unemployed and left in a fit of pique. He locked himself in Room 21 of the Changxing Hotel on Guangxi South Road, feeling extremely bored and conceiving an absurd idea. He went to a small engraving shop on Daxin Street to privately engrave several seals of his brother Zhonglin and the Kaitai Paint Shop's seals. He then asked a printing shop on Zhejiang South Road to print 50 books of Datong Bank checks, as well as his brother's name cards. He used the forged seals and receipts to defraud 15 cans of paint from the Gonghelai Paint Shop on Jixiang Street, worth 7.7 million yuan. He also defrauded 30 cans of paint from the Yizhong Paint Shop on Henan Road, worth 10.3 million yuan. After obtaining the money, he spent it lavishly, entirely in various dance halls. By the 28th of last month, he finally felt ashamed of his empty pockets and despaired of his future, and suddenly conceived a suicidal thought. In Room 100 of the Dadongxin Hotel on Yunnan South Road, he took poison to end his life. Fortunately, the tea room attendant, Xue Genxian, discovered him and reported to the cashier. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment and recovered. The hospital reported the situation to the Laozha Police Station, who sent police to investigate and learned of the above situation. After questioning him, he confessed everything. He will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling the crime of forging seals.

### After the Lifting of Martial Law - All-Night Operations - Still a Problem

After the Songhu Garrison Command announced the lifting of martial law from September 1st, it is still unclear whether all entertainment venues, bars, etc., can operate all night. One saying is that all-night operation is no longer prohibited, while another saying is that the police, the Social Affairs Bureau, etc., can still impose restrictions according to the General Mobilization Law, depending on the need, and cannot operate beyond the specified hours. Therefore, all-night operation is still a problem.

### Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Bite Old Man - What Hidden Secrets Are There?

### Postal Remittance Bureau - 1.3 Billion in Discounting - Far Ocean Company Implicated as Guarantor - Appeal against Provisional Execution

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Far Ocean Trading Company guaranteed Hengyu, Zhengtong, and 16 other banks and firms to apply for 1.347 billion yuan in discounting from the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Because the loan was not repaid when due, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau petitioned the District Court to provisionally seize the inventory of the guarantor, Far Ocean Trading Company. The Far Ocean Company received the court's ruling: "The company's existing 700 pieces of 20s Red Star cotton yarn in the Maotai Warehouse on Yangshupu Road, the Bank of Communications Warehouse, and the Four Banks Warehouse, within the amount of 2,834,298,269 yuan and 88 fen in national currency, shall be subject to provisional execution and seizure. After the debtor (referring to Far Ocean) provides the aforementioned amount as security, the provisional execution shall be suspended."

Reasons for Appeal

The Far Ocean Company expressed dissatisfaction with this ruling and yesterday submitted a petition to the District Court for referral to the High Court to file an appeal. The reasons for its appeal were summarized as follows: "In December of last year, the debtor (Far Ocean) separately guaranteed Hengyu, Zhengtong, and 16 other banks and firms to discount 1.347 billion yuan with 700 pieces of 20s Red Star cotton yarn as collateral to the creditor (Postal Remittance Bureau), holding bills of lading and discounting receipts as evidence. Because the address of the discounter, Hengyu Company, etc., could not be found, and the discounted goods were not shipped out, as of August 12th of this year, the principal and interest totaled 2,804,298,269 yuan and 88 fen in national currency, ordering the debtor to be responsible for repayment, and claiming that Zhenghe and Bachuan Banks collapsed on the same day, and the chairman of the debtor's board of directors was the same person as the chairman of the boards of directors of the two banks, and there was a connection between them. Because the debtor published a notice to sell a large number of surplus materials, it seemed to be evading debt, and there would be difficulties in execution in the future, etc. (1) Why did the creditor and the 16 companies of Hengyu, etc., not conduct sufficient investigation in advance when using cotton yarn as collateral, and were even unaware of whether the 16 companies existed, and did not investigate whether the discounted goods were real? It is not appropriate to not pay attention in advance and then catch shadows later. (2) Furthermore, the creditor urged the debtor to repay the discounted loan to Hengyu and other ten firms before it was handed over. This is not in accordance with the statutory procedures. (3) The chairman of the creditor's board of directors is the chairman of the Zhenghe and Bachuan Banks, which recently collapsed. However, the debtor is a limited liability company, and its capital, accounting, personnel, and organization are independent from each other and have no relationship with Bachuan and Zhenghe Banks." It is heard that the Postal Remittance Bureau petitioned the Ministry of Transportation to seize a ship belonging to the Far Ocean Company and also petitioned the District Court to seize the inventory of the Far Ocean Company's warehouse, with a total value of over 40 billion yuan.

### In the Current National Economic Difficulties, Cooperation Between the People and the Government is Needed. Fang Xianting's Broadcast on "Everyone's Responsibility in Economic Difficulties"

[Report from this newspaper] This newspaper held its 22nd Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Greater China Continental Radio Station, inviting Fang Xianting, acting director of the China Economic Research Institute, to broadcast on "Everyone's Responsibility in Economic Difficulties." The following is a summary of his speech:

Two years have passed since the victory, and today, the degree of economic difficulty in the country is even greater than during the Anti-Japanese War, which no one expected. The ominous symbol of the economic crisis and the root cause of the people's suffering lies in the ever-rising price problem. The reason for rising prices is that too much currency has been issued, and the reason for the excessive issuance of currency is that the government's fiscal revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, so it has to rely on issuing currency to make up for the deficit. However, when too much currency is issued and prices rise, the government needs more money to purchase real goods such as military grain and uniforms, and the salaries of public officials and soldiers are also adjusted accordingly, so the government's expenditure increases even more; while revenue decreases in real value due to rising prices, so the imbalance between revenue and expenditure becomes even greater, and the amount of currency to be issued increases even more. Thus, the more currency is issued, the more prices rise, creating a vicious cycle. This is the painful reality we have witnessed and experienced in recent years.

How to Maintain Stable Prices

The way to solve the problem at its root is to ensure that prices remain unchanged or rise only slightly after the government increases the issuance of currency. In this way, the government does not have to issue more currency, or the amount it needs to issue becomes less and less. However, to maintain stable prices or only a slight increase, the most fundamental way is to ensure that after the government increases the issuance of currency, it can immediately recover the currency from the people. Transfer the purchasing power in the hands of the people to the government, allowing the government to purchase goods. This method of recovering currency includes taxes, public bonds, and special donations. Taxes and public bonds are the main methods used in the United Kingdom and the United States. However, China's tax system is unsound, profit tax and income tax are not feasible, and public bonds cannot be sold, so the government has to use the sale of gold, the sale of enemy property, and surplus materials to recover legal tender. However, these materials are limited, and the government's need to expand currency is too great, so this method quickly failed.

Secondly, if the quantity of goods produced can also increase sharply with the increase in the amount of currency, prices will not rise too sharply. Because the price is the ratio of goods to legal tender, if there is more legal tender and the same amount of goods, the average price will not rise. Originally, when currency begins to inflate and prices rise, it stimulates the increase in production. Because the price of products rises, the price of raw materials purchased is low, and wages are fixed in the short term, so the profit of industrial production increases, and entrepreneurs all want to expand production. However, under the continuous expansion of currency, this favorable expansion has its limits. Because everyone expands production and competes to purchase raw materials, the price of raw materials soon rises; and because general prices rise, workers also demand higher wages. After a considerable period, the relative price of raw materials and wages may rise faster and higher than the price of products, that is, the selling price of industrial products is not even enough to cover their reproduction costs, so that continuing production is not only unprofitable but also a loss. At this time, they hoard raw materials and sell them at high prices, which is more profitable than engaging in production. If the government gives them low-interest loans to purchase raw materials, their profits from hoarding raw materials will be even greater, so everyone will compete to hoard raw materials. At this time, production will not only fail to increase but will also decrease. According to our statistics, Chongqing reached this stage in 1941 during the Anti-Japanese War, and Shanghai also reached this stage from 1944 during the war. In this way, the amount of currency increases, the amount of goods decreases, and the degree of price increase is further aggravated.

The Poor Become Poorer and the Rich Become Richer

Another misfortune for China's industrial production after the war was the government's erroneous foreign exchange policy, which dealt a blow to industrial production. In early 1946, when foreign trade resumed, the government set the foreign exchange value of legal tender very high, stipulating that the exchange rate for the US dollar was 2020 legal tender per US dollar. Under this exchange rate, cheap American goods were imported in large quantities, and there were no import controls at the time, so domestic industrial production was in danger of collapse due to competition from cheap and good foreign goods. At that time, the government did this in an attempt to suppress domestic prices by importing cheap foreign goods; as a result, prices were temporarily stabilized, but in less than a few months, the government's large foreign exchange resources were almost exhausted, and the import of foreign goods had to be restricted, which finally led to the jump in prices after the winter of last year. Because foreign exchange is exhausted, various raw materials and products needed for current industry cannot be imported in sufficient quantities, and production is further suffocated. The soaring prices in the first half of this year, which have risen tens of thousands of times, cannot be excused from the mistakes of past policies.

As mentioned earlier, the higher the price rises, the more currency is issued, which creates an extremely unreasonable distribution problem. We know that currency is equivalent to a head tax, and everyone bears the same amount regardless of wealth, which has resulted in the wealthier people feeling less of a burden; at the same time, in the process of currency inflation, although the government has controls, they have not been thorough, and the wealthy class has been able to take advantage of the opportunity of soaring prices to engage in speculative activities, hoarding and profiteering, making huge profits; so the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. In addition, various low-interest production loans and past policies on the sale of gold and foreign exchange have all provided the greatest convenience to the wealthy, further creating a large concentration of wealth.

Working Together to Overcome Difficulties

In the extremely chaotic and painful economic situation of the country, the arrival of the Wedemeyer Mission once brought hope to the people, believing that the United States could help us overcome economic difficulties. In fact, this hope is the most humiliating. We must solve our own problems, and we must overcome the current difficulties through our own efforts. How to overcome these difficulties requires the joint efforts and cooperation of the government and the people; the government has its responsibilities, and the people also have their responsibilities.

In terms of the government's responsibility, after the destruction of the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, when the people urgently need to recuperate, it is an unavoidable measure to implement the pacification policy, which should take into account the strength of the country and the lives of the people. Under the pacification policy, the government should implement a tight fiscal policy and should use special methods to raise revenue. Regarding the source of war expenses, the "National Construction Special Donation" should be implemented immediately, and the rich should take out money. The government should also reduce current expenditures as much as possible to achieve absolute balance between revenue and expenditure.

While the government is implementing the above reforms, the people must also cooperate with the government and fulfill their responsibilities. For example, if the government wants to hold a "National Construction Special Donation," the wealthy should look at the suffering of the general public and donate generously for the sake of the country and for their own sake. Many people are now fleeing their assets abroad. Is it really possible to not need a country if you have money? This action will cause the world to look down on us.

Secondly, the general businessmen and speculators must take responsibility. We all know that because everyone rushes to buy goods when they have money, the velocity of currency circulation has greatly increased. This requires the general public to automatically cooperate with the government. If the people do not rush to buy goods at any time, then no matter how much currency the government issues, prices will not rise so much. To stop prices from rising, it will be easier to start solving all problems. Whether China's current economic difficulties can be overcome depends on whether the government and the people can do what is said above.

### Taizhou Guildhall Locked Down; Police Officers Arresting Gamblers Softly Imprisoned

[Report from this newspaper] The Taizhou Guildhall on Jumen Road in the Nanshi District recently raised funds to hold a Taoist ritual. The Songshan Police Sub-Bureau learned that some people were taking the opportunity to gamble, so around 10 PM the night before, Officer Bao of the Judicial Section led police officers to the scene, arrested 24 gamblers on the spot, seized more than one million yuan in gambling money and many gambling tools, and took them all back to the bureau for punishment. Unexpectedly, at 5 PM yesterday afternoon, they received another tip that the guildhall was still gambling. Section Chief Shen Zuoluo immediately ordered section members Zhang Jingfang and Chen Linshu to supervise more than ten plainclothes police officers and rush to the scene in a police car. As soon as they entered the gate, the police saw only three mahjong tables. Just as they were about to return to the bureau, they learned that more than 200 people had gathered there and locked the gate, softly imprisoning all the police officers inside. Fortunately, a chauffeur climbed over the wall and ran to the nearby Liyuan Road Police Station to report the incident. He also telegraphed the sub-bureau to send a large number of police officers from the security police squadron and all uniformed police officers to rush to the scene, break down the gate, and rescue the police officers. At the same time, they arrested 20 troublemakers, including Tong Ruying, and took them to the bureau along with three sets of mahjong tiles for investigation.

### Zhu Shaoliang in Kunming Expresses His Impressions of His Tour of Southwest China

[Report from our Kunming office, 27th by air] Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the lives of the people in the southwestern provinces have been relatively stable. However, the root cause of the "inflation" disease cannot be solved. Therefore, Chairman Chiang specially ordered Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Chongqing Executive Headquarters, to take the opportunity of inspecting the four southwestern provinces to convey the central government's care and goodwill to the people on behalf of the government.

Director Zhu set off from Chongqing on August 1. At that time, General Zhu had just recovered from his illness, but he embarked on a strenuous journey, and decided to travel by car all the way, which shows his hard work. He first inspected Chengdu, Ya'an, Rongshan and other places in Sichuan, and then set off from Luzhou, Sichuan on August 15, passing through Xuyong, Bijie, Weining, Xuanwei, and arrived in Kunming on the afternoon of the 18th along the Sichuan-Guizhou East Road. Various agencies and people's organizations in Kunming had already prepared a warm welcome. In addition to the provincial government sending special personnel and cars to meet him, the Gucheng Gutong Park in the east of the city was crowded with people at noon on the 19th, waiting for the arrival of the representative of the head of state.

At 2:07 PM, a row of Samsung jeeps slowly drove into the urban area amidst the melodious sound of military music. General Zhu looked radiant and dignified. He was first greeted by Chairman Lu into the Guqu Garden for a short rest. That day, officials gathered and the event was extremely grand. It was another rare grand event in Kunming since the visit of Commander-in-Chief Guan. Everyone's emotions were very enthusiastic. General Zhu exchanged greetings and chatted with Chairman Lu, Inspector Zhang, Director Deng, Commander-in-Chief He, and Chairman of the Council, showing no signs of fatigue. Then, amidst a burst of military music, he went to Jinbi Villa to rest. The reporter Hua Deng got into a small car and followed him to the residence. After waiting for a while, General Zhu

Received the reporter in military uniform.

He said that although the journey was relatively hard, it was much better than in the Northwest in terms of geographical environment, humanities, climate, transportation, etc. The purpose of this trip was to represent Chairman Chiang in comforting the people of the four provinces, and also to inspect the general military administration and public security in the Southwest, and to give instructions on the mobilization for pacification. The southwestern provinces made great contributions during the war. Since the victory and the return of the capital, Chairman Chiang has always been thinking of the people of the southwestern provinces. Since General Zhu took office in June, he has been aware that military administration, economy, transportation, education, culture, and border defense in the four provinces all need to know more about the

Rich local conditions.

Therefore, he decided to personally make a long-distance tour, regardless of the hardship.

Sichuan Province has advantageous geographical environment and economic conditions. Although the impression of Yunnan is not deep, it is rich in human and material resources and has a bright future. As for the border areas of Guizhou, they are too poor, and the people's lives need to be improved. General Zhu spoke in a Fujian accent, expressing his tour impressions. When talking about the public security issue in Xikang, he replied to the reporter with great confidence. There is no need to worry about bandits. The central government's forces are sufficient to suppress them.

For several days in a row, there were banquets and evening parties. Famous actors from Kunming and Yunnan were mobilized together, and the scene was unprecedentedly grand. He summoned military and agency chiefs to give instructions, and inspected the 26th Division stationed in Kunming. He was busy all day and worked extremely hard. On the 23rd, at the invitation of Chairman Lu, he went to the hot springs for a short rest, and talked with various officials, giving instructions on important matters. The "No. 1 Hot Spring in the World" was of great benefit to Director Zhu's foot ailment. It is said that after several days of washing, the foot ailment has been completely cured, and

Walking is very strong.

Unlike the uneasiness on the journey. In order to continue to inspect Guizhou, and also to go to Beijing to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, General Zhu, although he had many good feelings about Yunnan, had to decide to leave Kunming on the 28th. He said: After returning from Nanjing, I would like to stay in Kunming for a few months. From this, it can be seen that Director Zhu has a very deep and good impression of Kunming.

Guizhou Chairman Yang Zihui has sent a special commissioner to Panxian to greet General Zhu. Because the people of Guizhou are also waiting for the arrival of the representative of the head of state. (Special correspondent Xu Ji)

[Report from our Kunming office, 27th] General Zhu Shaoliang is very concerned about the people's livelihood during this trip to the Southwest. He told our reporter: During this trip, he visited local customs and investigated people's lives. He has a clearer comparison of prices in various places. The cost of living in Chengdu is the most expensive, and life in Hezhang, Guizhou is the cheapest. Eggs are only 50 yuan each, and rice is only 40,000 yuan per dan. Crossing the border of Guizhou, prices are climbing again. By the time you get to Kunming, they are already at a peak. (Lian)

### Yanghua Wheel Sinks; 49 Bodies Recovered

[Report from our Yangzhou office, 31st] The tragic sinking of the Yanghua Wheel has attracted the attention of the provincial government and all parties here.

### Worshipping Confucius? Honoring Teachers? More Than 200 Students in Anyang Destroy the Main Hall of the Zhengzhou Confucius Temple

[Report from our Zhengzhou office, 28th] After the ceremony of worshipping Confucius and the conference of honoring teachers were held in the main hall of the Zhengzhou Confucius Temple on Teachers' Day, it was destroyed at 7 PM that night by more than 200 students from Anyang County Middle School and County Teachers' School who fled to Zhengzhou. This is a very regrettable incident in the midst of the movement of honoring teachers and valuing education. The main hall of the Confucius Temple here is the Tianshi Auditorium of the Zheng County Teachers' School, which houses some of the Anyang students who fled to Zhengzhou. The Zheng County Teachers' School, in order to commemorate Confucius' birthday on the 27th, notified the resident students to temporarily move out in accordance with the order, so as to hold a memorial meeting. On the evening of the same day, more than 200 Anyang students, led by teacher Qu Cha, went to the school to negotiate for continuing to stay, and a conflict occurred with Wang, the school's clerk, which caused a martial arts drama. At that time, all the teachers and students of the Zheng Teachers' School in the school were driven out of the school by the Anyang students, and the school gate was tightly closed and locked, and they carried out destruction. Then, the county magistrate and others rushed to the scene after hearing the news, but the order was already chaotic. As a result, the county magistrate and the chairman of the county council persuaded them to calm down. The Anyang students who fled to Zhengzhou are temporarily staying in various middle schools in Zhengzhou. Now, various middle schools have issued expulsion orders to the Anyang students because the school opening period is approaching. Some of the Anyang students staying in the Provincial Middle School were thrown out of their shops a few days ago. Therefore, this incident can be said to contain a retaliatory meaning.

### Official Gift Like a Pig, Fresh Blood Flowing: Villainous Old Man of Changzhou Executed, Ge Duoduo Shot Dead, Ni Wenlin Also Killed

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 29th] Zhou Huanzhang, Shi Haosheng, and Ge Duoduo, known as the "Three Tigers of Changzhou," colluded with bandits and the enemy during the War of Resistance, acting as traitors, wreaking havoc in the area, robbing homes, and killing people like flies. Zhou has already been executed, and Shi is in hiding. Ge Duoduo even joined the bandit military district commander Zhou Bida's unit, taking on peripheral work and openly conscripting grain for the bandits in the sixth, seventh, and eighth districts, coercing each bao (neighborhood) to provide two shi (units of grain). Shen Shan, the seventh district head, obtained this information and, together with Zhang Wenbin, captain of the county security brigade, led a team to suppress them on the evening of the 23rd. When they arrived at Yan Tangxia in Shangdian Township, Ge the bandit fled from a house barefoot and shirtless. District Head Shen ordered him to stop, but Ge resisted stubbornly.

### More Than Ninety Opium Dens in Xiamen, Only a Dozen Raided, Continued Suppression Urgently Needed

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 27th] In 1846, China was forced to open five ports for trade after losing the Opium War. Xiamen was one of them. Subsequently, the British privately shipped opium from Hong Kong to Xiamen for sale, and opium dens emerged in response. Moreover, because Xiamen and Taiwan face each other across the sea, Taiwanese rogues were instigated by the Japanese ruling authorities to engage in espionage activities in Xiamen. These people had no legitimate occupations and did their utmost to protect opium and gambling activities. During the eight years of Xiamen's occupation during the War of Resistance, there were more than 300 opium dens at their peak, which was tantamount to openly dealing in and consuming drugs.

After the restoration, the opium trade entered a secret phase, but the toxic atmosphere still permeated the city. Drugs shipped from Hong Kong and Shantou to Fujian used Xiamen as a distribution center. Under the protection of special forces, there were still more than 90 secret opium dens in the city. Recently, the authorities have raided more than a dozen, but it is still far from being completely eradicated. It is urgently hoped that the authorities will continue to strictly suppress drugs.

### Strengthening Atomic Energy Research and Paying Attention to Basic Science: Seven Scientific Organizations' Joint Annual Meeting Discusses Special Topics Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The joint annual meeting of seven scientific organizations, including the China Science Society, was held for the second day yesterday. Papers were read at the Shanghai Medical College in the morning. At 3 p.m., special topics were discussed at the China Science Society: (1) Ways to improve China's scientific education; (2) Atomic energy and peace. More than 150 members attended, chaired by Yan Jici and Cao Xingqing. The discussions were candid and enthusiastic, and it was generally believed that the development of science should benefit mankind and that atomic energy should not be used as a weapon of war. Chinese scientists should cooperate with scientists from all countries to strive for the creation of human happiness and world peace. There were several conclusions: (1) Atomic energy should be used for peaceful construction; (2) China should strengthen its research on atomic energy and should start from the basics, that is, pay attention to the overall progress of basic science; (3) The government should attach importance to basic science and allocate special funds for atomic energy research; (4) Scientists should have their own sense of responsibility and have a social awareness of justice, morality, and responsibility to society, the country, and even mankind. As for the issue of improving China's scientific education, it was unanimously agreed that the scientific equipment of various educational and research institutions in China is insufficient, and the salaries of researchers are so low that they are not enough to maintain their lives, let alone research? The government should find a fundamental solution. Basic and social education is more important than school education, and scientific education should be integrated with people's lifestyles in the future. There are also several concrete suggestions that the government is advised to adopt. The meeting adjourned at about 7 p.m. At 4 p.m., Bing Zhi gave a public lecture on "The Path of Life" at the National School of Mechanical Engineering.

### Textile Construction Strives for Overseas Cloth Market; Signs Agency Sales Contracts with Overseas Chinese Merchants; If Trial Implementation Is Effective, Warehouses Will Be Established in Various Locations

[Report from this newspaper] In order to explore the overseas market for domestically produced cloth and enrich the country's foreign exchange resources, the China Textile Construction Company has recently been sparing no effort to promote cloth exports. According to a person in charge of the company speaking to reporters, the company's cloth sales to various parts of Southeast Asia, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Siam, the Philippines, and areas with concentrated overseas Chinese, will temporarily adopt the agency sales method. The decision to entrust a centralized joint venture company or individual companies to act as agents will depend on the degree of trade freedom in each location. As for areas in the Near East, Middle East, such as Iran, Syria, Abyssinia, and the Americas, such as Mexico, where there are few overseas Chinese and the situation is relatively isolated, the company sells to various export trading houses in the city for direct export.

The company's entrustment of various companies to act as agents for cloth sales in Southeast Asia is currently in the trial stage. If the trial implementation is successful, the next step in the plan is to imitate the way Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco gasoline companies set up oil depots in various locations, and establish warehouses in Hong Kong, Singapore, Siam, Manila, and other places to regularly stock the cloth needed in various locations, so that goods can flow smoothly and supply and demand can be adjusted in various locations, so that the funds of the various agency sales companies can also be circulated. At the same time, this will allow the company to maintain a reasonable and stable market price for cloth sales in various locations. The agency sales contracts that the company has currently signed include Hong Kong, Singapore, and Siam. The agency sales contract for the Philippines is expected to be signed within the week. Among the contracts that have been signed, the contracts for Hong Kong and Singapore entrust the China National Products Joint Venture Company to act as an agent for sales. The contracts were signed one and a half months ago, and both locations have already tried selling a batch of cloth. The Siam contract was only signed on August 27th. In Siam, the China United Company, which is jointly funded by 80 or 90 Chinese business firms engaged in the cloth industry in the area, came forward to sign the agency sales contract. The first batch of trial sales goods includes 500 bales of cotton yarn and 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth of various colors, and is currently awaiting loading and shipment to Siam. The agency sales contract for the Philippines is currently under negotiation, and there should be a breakthrough within the week. According to comparisons, the market price of cloth in Southeast Asia is currently better in Siam, and there is less competition from foreign goods, making it a good overseas market.

### Minister of Public Debt Chen Bingzhang Discusses the Issue of Foreign Currency Bond Repayments: US Dollar Bonds Will Still Be Repaid in Foreign Exchange

After the revision of the regulations for managing foreign exchange, should the short-term US dollar treasury bills of the 36th year continue to be issued and how should they be repaid? The Ministry of Finance, considering that this matter concerns the government's creditworthiness and involves other foreign currency bonds, has thoroughly discussed and drafted measures, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval on the 20th. The details of repaying the principal and interest at the exchange rate quoted by designated banks and continuing to issue short-term treasury bills have been reported in previous newspapers. Minister of Public Debt Chen Bingzhang of the Ministry of Finance came to Shanghai on official business the other day, and reporters visited him yesterday to inquire about the details. His answers are as follows:

(1) Regarding this case, the Ministry received an order from the Executive Yuan on the 30th night and immediately telegraphed the Central Bank to investigate and instruct compliance. It is expected that the 36th year treasury bills can be resumed for sale in various locations from today (the 1st).

(2) The phrase "various foreign currency bonds" mentioned in the Executive Yuan's order, which are to be converted at the market price of designated banks, refers to the foreign currency bonds issued in the 27th, 29th, and 31st years. As for the US dollar bonds of the 36th year, which were previously specially approved by the National Government to be repaid in foreign exchange, they should still be handled in accordance with the original regulations and will not be converted into national currency. The first installment of principal and interest funds for these bonds, which are due at the end of September this year, has already been allocated by the government to the Fund Management Committee for safekeeping and payment.

(3) Short-term treasury bills for the 38th year, totaling more than 27.4 million US dollars, have been sold. The interest payable on this portion is approximately 9.6 million US dollars. The end of September this year is the first installment for repaying the principal and interest, and the principal and interest funds have also been allocated to the Fund Management Committee for safekeeping.

(4) The issuance amounts of the gold bonds in the 27th and 29th years were 10 million British pounds and 50 million US dollars, respectively, but only a portion was sold. The remainder was mortgaged to national banks. The outstanding principal and interest on the sold portion is currently approximately 1.34 million British pounds and 25.6 million US dollars. The gold bonds of the 27th year are to be repaid in 30 installments over 15 years, and 8 years, or 16 installments, have already been repaid. The gold bonds of the 29th year are to be repaid in 50 installments over 25 years, and 5 years, or 10 installments, have already been repaid.

(5) The issuance amount of the Allied Victory US dollar bonds in the 31st year was 100 million US dollars, all of which were sold. They are to be repaid in 20 installments over 10 years, and 3.5 years, or 7 installments, have already been repaid. The outstanding principal and interest is currently approximately 97.2 million US dollars. As for the US dollar savings bonds of the 31st year, also totaling 100 million US dollars, approximately 19 million US dollars of principal is currently due.

(6) Payment of interest subsidies for purchasing the US dollar bonds of the 36th year should be calculated based on the market price of US dollars quoted by designated banks. The Ministry has telegraphed the Central Bank to investigate and handle this. The remaining technical issues arising from issuing treasury bills and repaying bonds at market prices will be discussed and decided in consultation with the National Bank.

(7) The government's decision to pay the principal and interest of foreign currency bonds at the market price quoted by designated banks will inevitably increase the burden on the national treasury. However, the authorities are still resolutely doing so, demonstrating their utmost intention to maintain the country's creditworthiness. Minister Yu of the Ministry has made a statement on this important measure, and I will not elaborate further. However, I hope that the people and the government will cooperate sincerely to implement rational financial policies. On the one hand, the government should establish creditworthiness, and on the other hand, the people should recognize and subscribe to bonds. If public debt policies can be implemented smoothly in the future, it will not only benefit the reduction of inflation, but also show our nation's determination to rely on its own efforts.

### Overseas Chinese Merchants in the Philippines Establish a Joint Venture Company

[Report from this newspaper] The Philippine overseas Chinese merchants Zhonghua, Huadong, Huatong, Shengxing, Nantong, Xinghua, Zhendong, and others, in order to negotiate and manage the sale of cloth from the Textile Construction Company in the Philippines, sent representatives to Shanghai to discuss with the Textile Construction authorities several times. It is now known that the seven overseas Chinese merchants have decided to jointly invest with the Shanghai cloth export merchants Jianhua, Damao, and others to establish a joint venture company for the sale of cloth in the Philippines, with a capital amount of 1 million US dollars. The head office will be located in Manila, and an office will be established in Shanghai. The joint venture company will come forward this week to sign a contract with the Textile Construction Company for the agency sales of cloth in the Philippines. It is said that the first batch of trial sales goods is expected to be 50,000 bolts of cotton cloth of various colors, with printed cloth and bleached cloth accounting for the majority. It is said that when the Textile Construction Company delivers the goods, the joint venture company will first pay 80% of the payment, and a bank will guarantee the remaining 20%, which will be settled after the cloth is sold in the Philippines. At the same time, the Textile Construction Company will also send personnel to the Philippines to monitor the agency sales situation.

### Central Bank Formulates Measures for Paying Yarn After Agent Spinning of Imported Cotton

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the foreign cotton allocated to various yarn mills under the first and second quarter foreign cotton quotas of the Import Quota Allocation Office, the Central Bank previously consulted with the Textile Adjustment Committee and decided to have the government take back this cotton and hand it over to the yarn mills that obtained quota allocations for agent spinning and payment of yarn. The foreign exchange and other expenses paid by the factories for ordering foreign cotton have been directly returned by the Central Bank with interest, and the factories should provide payment receipts and other documents to the Central Bank for registration. As for the portion of foreign cotton allocated in the second quarter that has not yet been settled but has been ordered, the factories can still apply according to the prescribed procedures, submit the relevant documents, and have the bank review and forward them to the China and Citibank for processing without having to pay additional national currency, in order to reduce the procedures for returning and settling foreign exchange and simplify the process. As for the agent spinning labor payment profit and yarn collection payment, the Central Bank and the Textile Adjustment Committee have discussed and formulated the following measures:

(1) For the outstanding foreign exchange and additional fees under the import of foreign cotton in the two quarters, please have the Central Bank directly allocate the funds immediately. The application procedures for the re-import permit will still be handled by the factories as usual.

(2) The cost of purchasing cotton paid by the factories for foreign exchange settlement will be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 9%. Other financial preparation expenses will be calculated under the labor payment according to the actual situation.

(3) When the foreign cotton arrives, from the date of obtaining the customs permit, the factories should start paying yarn according to the prescribed period on the 30th day (20 days for handling lifting and entering the warehouse, and 10 days for manufacturing). The number of yarns paid daily, in addition to the yarns for general exchange and the yarns to be paid to the government, should not be less than half of the remaining amount produced at that time.

(4) The yarn payment price will be determined and announced in the upper ten days of each month according to the cost plus profit formula. The yarn payment for this month will be paid at the price set last month, with adjustments and settlements made when the price for that month is determined.

(5) The monthly price will be discussed and announced within the first seven days of the following month.

(6) The yarn collection for August will temporarily start with a payment price of 3.5 million yuan, and the settlement will be made after the price is determined in early September.

(7) The cost calculation should consider the four factors of "scale of state-owned and private enterprises," "newness of establishment," and region.

(8) The industry should provide the settlement of various advances for the purchase of cotton, etc., within three days of receiving the letter for return.

(9) Please have the Textile Adjustment Committee verify the amount of yarn paid by each factory and the time period, and issue a table to notify the six district trade associations to forward it to each factory for compliance with the deadline for yarn payment.

(10) Please have the six district associations draft matters that each factory should handle regarding the agent spinning part of foreign cotton and ask the Textile Adjustment Committee to approve and implement it.

Free Talk: Special Edition for Journalists' Day

### Where Is the Welfare of the Fourth Estate?

— Sen Lin

George Bernard Shaw once bluntly said, "Journalism is the highest form of literature; because all the highest literature is journalism." To be a journalist is, spiritually speaking, respectable enough.

Despite the existence of yellow journalism and capitalist newspapers in the 20th century, our country's so-called Fourth Estate—humbly speaking, the level below the third-class commoners—still cannot be said to be the typical model of a poor scholar.

Apart from a few superior exceptions in large cities, the majority of journalists across the country are perhaps still in a state of semi-starvation, just like public education personnel. The difference is that society, though unable to help public education personnel, at least extends some sympathy to them, while journalists are sometimes disliked by a section of special interest groups.

We often hear seniors in the industry say that journalists should not overestimate themselves in order to maintain a proper position, but they should also not overestimate themselves in order to avoid detaching from reality. This saying is truly unbreakable. From the perspective of journalists themselves, no one can deny that capitalism is an employment relationship. Furthermore, are so-called journalists not a group of intellectual laborers who write and edit?

The Geneva International Labour Office once compiled a survey report entitled "Working and Living Conditions of Journalists," which gathered a wealth of information on the working and living conditions of journalists in various countries. In terms of content, from the perspective of laborers, the more important aspects include dismissal and labor disputes. Working conditions include working hours, night work, weekly rest, annual leave, and wages. In addition, there is a chapter that is of personal concern to every journalist, namely the "labor market" for the issue of food, which investigates various information on unemployment and job seeking.

Journalism sounds like a freelance profession, but in reality, this profession is actually a cultural worker. In terms of material compensation, it is far inferior to doctors, lawyers, etc. Doctors can set their own consultation examples and charge fees at will, but journalists who can set their own publishing rates are probably one in a hundred. If doctors declare in advance that they can refuse house calls late at night, journalists who are engaged in editing work are considered to take it for granted that they work nervously until dawn every day.

Journalists often tell people that we must stand before the era to lead society, so why don't we have a concrete and substantial plan for the health protection, occupational protection, and all welfare undertakings of ourselves! In today's era of scientific development, why are the living conditions of newspaper employees still the same as they were fifty years ago?

Today, on Journalists' Day "September 1," can we take this issue as one of the topics for future research?

### Proposal for a "Journalists' Annual Meeting"

— Chu Yusheng

Since journalism is a specialized academic discipline, journalists should be practitioners and researchers of this discipline. Their status is academically equivalent to engineers, geological experts, and water conservancy experts. Since the advent of newspapers in China, the general public has had a misunderstanding of journalists, namely that as long as one is familiar with writing, one can serve as a journalist. Therefore, journalism as an academic discipline has not made much progress to this day. I remember that during the War of Resistance, the wartime capital Chongqing had an organization called the Journalism Society. The directors and supervisors of the society were all leaders in the national journalism industry. They were busy with their daily affairs, so they did not make significant progress. I personally, perhaps representing the general journalists, have a hope that there can be an organization for the Journalists' Annual Meeting. At this annual meeting, the insights that journalists usually research can be shared with the public, the practical work can be reported to the public, and papers on journalism can be read to the public. To participate in this annual meeting, one must have made considerable contributions to the journalism industry, must provide practical and concrete examples, or be a researcher of journalism, or have received specialized journalism education, or have received higher education and worked in a journalism position for two or three years.

Some people may ask, "Journalists are busy all the time, where do they have the time to participate in this annual meeting?" I say, we can elect representatives to bring our own research insights, work reports, and academic papers to the meeting to read. At the same time, a person who is a journalist should have traveled all over the world, and can take this opportunity to visit the location where the annual meeting is held.

Academics have no class. If journalists are interested in journalism and want to promote journalism forward, this Journalists' Annual Meeting is indeed necessary to hold.

### Provincial Journalists' Annual Meeting

— Lu Lu

In order to unite journalists themselves, the Jiangsu Provincial Journalists' Association chose a spring to establish itself in Zhenjiang. Spring is a beautiful season, and it is also a day with sunshine. It symbolizes the future glory and heat. At this great founding meeting, it was decided to hold the first annual meeting in Wuxi on Journalists' Day "September 1." The location of the first Journalists' Annual Meeting was chosen in Wuxi, which is our honor and the honor of all Wuxi people.

It is estimated that there will be sixty representatives of member journalists from various counties coming to Wuxi this time. We used a pleading style to book forty rooms in the best hotel newly opened in Wuxi—the China Hotel. However, tense news came from Shanghai that colleagues in Shanghai were running for legislative and national assembly members, putting up a clear banner to "coincide with the event." We had to leave them a more comfortable residence closer to the representatives. However, we still don't know how many people will come from Shanghai, and there is no way to contact them. We hope that friends in Shanghai can get in touch. (Address: No. 16, Qianxixi, Wuxi, Preparatory Office, Chief Executive Sha Zhonghu)

On the night of Journalists' Day "September 1," there will be a grand moonlight garden party at Liyuan. Dinner will be on the large lawn of that country. Ideally: there will be a lively party scene, as well as a quiet tea house with ballad singing. After 10:30 PM, there will be a lake cruise and chat. There will be roving music performances on the lake. Because it is suitable for the mood under the moon, Chinese orchestral music will be used. Kunqu opera will be sung. What will be lively is the gongs and drums arranged in the distance. Although there will be a fierce wind and a general order, they will be in the distance, and it will not make the guests on the boat feel a little irritable. Close your eyes and think: what a fascinating situation this is! The moonlight on the lake, the faint green mountains on the lake, and a few friends chatting in the boat. What a lovely scene this is!

### An Occasional Thought on Journalists' Day

— Huang Jiping

Celebrating Journalists' Day for the second time since the victory gives us in the profession spiritual comfort and encouragement, which is truly profound. As journalists, we bear a great mission: to promote culture and be the voice of the people. People even respectfully call us "Uncrowned Emperors." But how much of this can we actually achieve? We ourselves dare not say.

After twenty years as a journalist, I hope for a better next year, but next year is still unbearable! I recall a senior figure saying, "Things in China are always a mess." This is so true.

Looking back at the eight years of the War of Resistance, with arduous struggle, we adhered to national policy, opposed the "Peace Movement," and criticized the "Enemy and Puppets." Consequently, I was wanted by Wang Jingwei's government, leading me to live in seclusion, avoiding the dangers of those evil people, and losing my freedom. Thinking of those years of hard struggle, the pain still lingers!

The reality is such that no one can lose heart. We must fulfill our duties each day we are in our positions. Everyone should muster self-confidence, stand firm in determination, promote the cause of revival, and cooperate in national reconstruction. Personally, I hope to encourage myself, diligently research, and actively strive for progress.

### Collecting Bu Guang

— Hesheng

Gui Bu Guang represents a typical figure among millions of journalists. Before the War of Resistance, he worked in Shanghai; after the war, he wandered battlefields, leading a very difficult life.

When I received news of him, he was working for a newspaper in Shaoyang, Hunan. When the Xiang-Gui campaign broke out, he followed the refugees in a wandering journey, eventually arriving in the wartime capital, Chongqing.

When he was in Shaoyang, we often corresponded. He worked hard there, but his spirits were not high. Some said he was love-struck and had some kind of nervous disorder. Later, he encountered a fire that burned all his luggage to ashes. One can imagine how bad his mood was at that time.

When he arrived in Chongqing, I saw his name on the refugee list. At that time, I was still in southern Jiangxi, and I had a deep understanding and sympathy for the wartime displacement he had suffered. Because I had personally experienced the chaos of the battlefield.

Soon after, I learned that he had joined a newspaper in Chongqing. I was happy for him, hoping that he could settle down and take a good breath for his long-weakened body.

However, this breathing space was so short-lived. Not long after, I received the sad news of his death in Chongqing!

Bu Guang, like all journalists, possessed the highest integrity in the pursuit of truth. He loved truth and beauty. He abhorred hypocrisy and supported justice.

He read a lot and was uncompromising on matters of right and wrong.

However, reality and fantasy are so far apart and hazy. Bu Guang traveled tens of thousands of miles, ultimately dying in poverty and illness at his post, unnoticed. His death is not discouraging to us, but a source of encouragement!

History always looks forward. Even in the afterlife, Bu Guang will surely point us in the direction to advance!

### Science to the Rescue from Poverty

— Chen Zhengyu

Today's Chinese society is filled with discontent and unease—the good turning bad, and the bad turning worse. The state of the world and people's hearts is sigh-worthy! The historical residue left by thousands of years of stagnation under autocratic feudal politics has permeated our present-day thoughts, lives, and systems, causing us to deviate from a production-oriented basis. As a result, we appear poor and powerless.

Promoting science, developing culture, advancing production, and utilizing resources for the benefit of the people—we rely on these to build the nation and to shift the current superficial social atmosphere. We journalists should take this as our sacred duty, wielding our worn-out pens to instill in the people knowledge and concepts of scientific production.

### Soliloquy

— Ting

On my own holiday, I would like to raise the issue of our (internal affairs reporters') health, because countless colleagues have suffered enough from poor health! From the perspective of our careers, we sacrifice the individual for the masses. From the perspective of our profession, we are all selling our health. We are engaged in the 361st occupation.

People in this profession (those who don't sleep at night), nineteen out of ten suffer from a very serious chronic illness—a gradual breakdown of the nervous system. But over time, they seem to have gradually become accustomed to it, not feeling pity for their own pale and gaunt faces, but rather self-deprecatingly comforting themselves, saying, "We're used to it, it doesn't matter." This is too pitiful!

Today, I don't have the energy to celebrate the festival. I only hope to regain my health. For example: that telegraph agencies can submit their evening drafts earlier, that newspaper offices can implement a rotating rest system, and pay more attention to the fitness equipment and activities of night workers. That would be a great virtue!

### The Hollow Title of "Uncrowned Emperor"

— Zuo Xi

Before becoming a journalist, I envied the "honor and prestige" of the "Uncrowned Emperor." After becoming a journalist, I resented the hardship and poverty of my life every day.

I have a friend who has been in the news business for over 30 years, but all he has to show for it today is white hair and clean sleeves! Today, many journalists are still struggling under the heavy burden of life!

Just think: "Running around all day, working late into the night, from the first day of the year to New Year's Eve," a journalist's life, with often less than six hours of sleep and suffering from malnutrition, not to mention the hollow title of "Uncrowned Emperor," is probably worse than even the poorest teacher (of course, this is not a general statement). A few days ago, the day after Teachers' Day, there was reportedly a tragic incident of a group suicide among teachers. We certainly don't want the same tragedy to occur on Journalists' Day, but who can guarantee that such things will never happen?

Journalists' Day should be the most memorable festival for us. But writing a few commemorative articles and holding a celebratory meeting every year seems too boring and meaningless. If the "Uncrowned Emperors" could do something on this day each year to seek benefits for themselves and establish a long-term plan for future generations, wouldn't that be more meaningful?

I hope that the "Uncrowned Emperors" will have a day of "tiles turning over," at least no longer being part of the oppressed group in society!

### "Firsts" in Newspaper History

— Yun

The first modern newspaper was the "North China Herald," an English weekly, first published on June 26th of the 30th year of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty (August 3rd, 1850 in the Gregorian calendar).

The first Chinese daily newspaper was the "Shanghai Xinbao," first published in November of the 11th year of the Xianfeng Emperor (December 1861).

The first English daily newspaper was the "Shanghai Daily Times," first published on August 11th of the 11th year of the Xianfeng Emperor (September 15th, 1861).

The first Chinese evening newspaper was the "Yebao," first published in the 8th year of the Guangxu Emperor (1882).

The first English evening newspaper was the "Evening Express," first published on September 4th of the 6th year of the Tongzhi Emperor (October 1st, 1867).

The first Chinese daily newspaper to use domestic telegraphic news was the "Shenbao," published on November 4th of the 7th year of the Guangxu Emperor (December 24th, 1881).

The first newspaper printed with a rotary press was the "Xinwenbao" in the early years of the Republic of China.

The first newspaper to have military correspondents was the "Shenbao," during the Sino-French War in the 10th year of the Guangxu Emperor.

The first newspaper written in colloquial language was the "Minbao," founded on March 5th of the 2nd year of the Guangxu Emperor (March 20th, 1876) and published by the "Shenbao."

The first newspaper printed with color plates was the "Shibao" on June 1st, 1927.

The first Chinese daily newspaper printed on white paper was the "Shanghai Xinbao" in 1861.

The first small-format newspaper was the "Youxibao," first published on June 24th of the 23rd year of the Guangxu Emperor (1897).

The first newspaper supplement was the "Tongwen Xiaoxianlu" of the "Tongwen Hubao."

The first pictorial magazine was the "Xiaohai Yuebao" published by the Shanghai Qingxin Shuguan.

The first modern pictorial magazine attached to a newspaper was the "Shibao Tuhua Zhoukan" in 1920.

The first newspaper to add a local supplement was the "Shenbao" in 1924.

The first newspaper to be shut down for political reasons was the "Subao."

The first foreign news agency to send news from China (Shanghai) was "Reuters."

The first institution to establish a journalism department was St. John's University, but it was only a special program.

The earliest precursor to modern newspapers was the "Records of Current Global Affairs Each Month," 130 years ago, during the 20th year of the Jiaqing Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. During the years of the Tongguang Emperor, there was also a "Records of East and West Oceans Each Month." Therefore, the "North China Herald" cannot be called the first.

Regarding the beginning of the first daily newspaper, the Chinese evening newspaper "Zhongwai Xinwen" was earlier than the "Shanghai Xinbao," during the 8th year of the Xianfeng Emperor, but it was initially published every two days, then daily, and was a supplement to the Hong Kong-based "Maici Bao." As for evening newspapers, it was earlier than the "Yebao."

The first official supplement was the "Ziyoutan" of the "Shenbao," founded in the 3rd year of the Xuantong Emperor.

The Spring and Autumn Annals

### A Word of My Own

Reporters are supposedly uncrowned kings, but I don't know who bestowed that title. I imagine it was an old saying from peaceful times. Now times have changed, and it's no longer a reliable description. As a reporter who is also a scholar, I naturally belong to the scholar class among scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants. In reality, due to the changing times, I have fallen to the bottom of the ladder.

Especially those of us who work on supplements, ranked as concubines, have even less to say.

I often hear a popular song with a line that says, "Nightlife is all for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation." It always sounds a bit harsh and suggestive, and one can imagine the meaning of life when one is often accompanied by knives, scissors, and paste under dim lights late at night.

However, when we receive many manuscripts from writers and letters from readers every night, we often feel a lot of intangible comfort, which is also a fact.

Life cannot be solely for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and there are many more things one can do for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Perhaps this is what Qu Yuan meant when he said, "I know that harm comes from chasing after things, but I cannot bear to give them up." Therefore, when faced with the choice between "speaking frankly and risking one's life?" or "following the crowd to get rich and live a cowardly life?", we ultimately chose the former. Of course, this is the only reason.

Logically speaking, the chaos of the times is abnormal, and the reversal of worldly affairs is a deformity. One day, there will be peace and clear distinctions between right and wrong, and truth will still be truth. As for our friends who edit supplements, if we can maintain this clean space in this era and provide readers with some clean spiritual food, then we can barely feel guilt-free; this is how we comfort and encourage ourselves.

On this Journalists' Day, I cannot remain silent, so I have hastily written a few words, which can be considered my own words. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the writers and readers. (Editor)

### In Memory of Venerable Master Hongyi

— Kuang Ying

— Sixth Anniversary of His Passing

Six years have passed since Venerable Master Hongyi passed away. The precious raft sailed south, and sentient beings lost their reliance. Thinking about the emptiness of our country's art scene and the uneasiness of the literary world in recent years, one cannot help but think of this giant of the literary world.

Wu Zhihui once said, "Li Shutong could have been an artist, but he stubbornly chose to become a monk." Many people agree with Wu Lao's statement. Those who know Hongyi's life history believe that this man who had a strong interest and deep research in traditional Chinese painting, epigraphy, music, literature, and drama, who once ran a newspaper, engaged in revolutionary work, and was a romantic and unrestrained gentleman of the decadent world, unexpectedly became so passive in his middle age that he would enter the Buddhist gate. In the eyes of ordinary people, this is a mystery.

In fact, it is not easy to study and understand Hongyi's thoughts and life. After a person has tasted the most intense and complex life, he wants to return to simplicity. Originally, art is a weapon to reflect, express, and judge life, so the purpose of art is active. Hongyi was a person who had profound research in art. The reason why he was willing to give up his artistic life and turn to the dry and lonely life of the Buddhist scriptures was because the era he lived in was a chaotic society. Looking outward, there was social unrest; looking inward, there was family decline. His joining the Tongmenghui to engage in revolution was an expression of patriotic and angry enthusiasm. Later, his quiet departure from the world, turning from a revolutionary into a monastic life, was because time diluted his enthusiasm and he gained enlightenment from the Buddhist scriptures' teachings of "the impermanence of all beings" and "the emptiness of all forms."

Hongyi, in his youth, enjoyed the pleasures of the world, had a wife and two concubines, loved famous courtesans, indulged in opera singers, and befriended singers, which can be described as extremely romantic. But later, he was tonsured at Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, and his wife and daughters could not even see him. What was the reason for this? Generally speaking, extreme enjoyment is often the prelude to extreme desolation. Extreme intensity leads to a longing for simplicity, and extreme happiness leads to sorrow. It can be said that it is human nature. At this time, everyone has the opportunity to realize the emptiness of life, but ordinary people cannot understand the emptiness of life. Intelligent people can often extricate themselves from the frenetic pace of life. Hongyi had a profound artistic cultivation, and the deeper his understanding of life, the deeper his understanding of life.

Today, it has been a full six years since the Master passed away in Zhangzhou, Fujian. In his later years, the Master loved the climate of southern Fujian, saying that he would grow old in this land. Earlier, the Master had a trip to Southeast Asia, but it did not happen because of the war. At that time, he wrote to his friends, expressing his willingness to sacrifice himself for his teachings in the face of the enemy's difficulties. Here is an excerpt from a letter: "To Layman Jianhun, I am pleased to hear of your well-being. I am infinitely grateful for your care. Because of the persuasion of Master Chuan Guan, my trip to the Philippines was postponed, thus avoiding the disaster. Otherwise, I would have been imprisoned in Gulangyu. But I have had the determination to sacrifice myself for my teachings in the face of the enemy's difficulties for four years, which I have mentioned to Master Chuan Guan and others. The ancient poem says, 'Do not dislike the old gardener's late autumn scenery, there is still the fragrance of late-blooming yellow flowers.' The later years are the most important in our lives, and I would like to encourage my colleagues to do the same."

From this letter, we can see the Master's steadfastness in dealing with the world, which is completely different from his romantic and unrestrained personality in his youth. Everything in the Master's youth was completely a "playful" behavior, like an unmoored boat, unrestrained and free. After becoming a monk, the Master was completely focused on "saving the world." Therefore, even writing and painting, he was afraid that it would hinder his spiritual practice, so he put down his pen and did not write. We speculate that the Master's subjective consciousness was that, as a revolutionary who saved the country and the people in his youth, he walked on the edge of society; and in his later years, with the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" he universally saved all beings. He was equally compassionate and sacrificing to save people, and there was no difference in the essence of his thoughts. When the Master became a monk, he only carried a shoe and a bowl, but his great ambition was to save all those who were suffering. Therefore, when he was seriously ill, he said, "After I pass away, I will come back on a precious raft, and all the事业 of saving sentient beings can be completed." At the same time, when he was in great pain, he still wrote the four large characters "Sorrow and Joy Intermingled," which shows the Master's great vow and his strict self-discipline, as well as the sorrow and joy at the time of his death. If not for a high monk, if not for a great vow, how could he do this?

The Master passed away in southern Fujian on September 1, 1942. The world has changed as before. Now the Master's grave has been built. Remembering this talented and versatile Master, I suddenly feel a sense of loss of reliance as the precious raft goes west.

### Poems from Beyond the Border

— Li Qifeng

Dusk

On the ridge at dusk

An old traveler walked by

Unloaded his zither

Took off his camel bells

He said:

"I'm afraid the young people will feel lonely"

The Song of the Lily of the Valley

You are the flower blooming in my life

Enduring the torment of fierce winds and bitter rain

Someday:

I will truly be draped in blue sky and pillowed by green fields

I don't want your tears nor your song

I want you to leave your fragrance to the world

Accompanying me into oblivion

Afternoon at the Sickbed Window

Unshakable cicada song

Unbreakable idle sorrow

Under the sickbed window I think

Is the blue sky my hometown?

Why do the white clouds look so familiar to me

Unshakable cicada song

Unbreakable idle sorrow

Under the sickbed window I think

Is the green bamboo curtain my friend?

Why is the shadow of the tulip

Also so thin

The railing blocks out the loneliness of the earth

Leaving only white wisteria swaying in the west wind

Faintly reflecting a bunch of yellow flowers

The anxious footsteps of youth, ah!

The White Sandy Road

The White Cross

A woman in black wearing a veil wanders by again

Untitled

I love the blue sky as much as the stars

The blue sky is the desert in my heart

The stars are the little flowers in my heart

When lonely, I can't help but be helpless

"What is the taste of longing"?

In my dream

My love hesitates over the border

Braving the wind and sand

The Window

By the window

A child quietly listens

To the old one-legged cricket chirping

Hey

You shouldn't understand loneliness

A star falls in the southern sky

You smile lightly

### Additions and Subtractions to Poetry Lines

— Zhu Wen

The Henan Shao Clan's Records of Things Heard and Seen states: In the Tang Dynasty, there was a person in charge of the imperial examinations who had a poem that said: "The plane tree leaves the shadow of the Luojing Pavilion, the vermilion doors of the examination hall are deeply closed. I have tasted the hardship of yesteryear, and I will not betray my original intention today." Later, a failed candidate adapted it into a five-character poem to mock him. This is from the Records of the Arashi Studio. Du Mu's Qingming poem: "During the Qingming Festival, the rain falls in torrents, the travelers on the road are desolate. May I ask where the tavern is? The shepherd boy points to Xinghua Village in the distance." Ye Pingyan's poem on the events of late spring: "Pairs of wrens walk on the desk, specks of willow catkins enter the inkstone. Sitting idly by the small window, reading the Book of Changes, I don't know how much of spring has passed." If you remove the first two characters from each character, they are all five-character quatrains. Li Bai's poem: "The forests and valleys before my robe gather the evening colors, the mist and haze on my sleeves collect the evening glow;" Wang Wei's poem: "Vast rice fields with flying white egrets, shady summer trees with singing golden orioles," by adding two characters each to Xie Lingyun and Li Jiayou's five-character lines, they feel refreshed and ancient.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 389

Old Long: "I say...everyone in the village! (This is read as Qing, which is not commonly used, but because the author thinks that Old Long is a [ ], his speech is very dramatic, so I simply made him dramatic to the end, borrowing two words to suit his fantasy. The actual title is "Head of the House")—I say...in terms of personality and ability, neither of us brothers is good enough, (personality is probably a mispronunciation of "qualifications"), neither of us brothers can decipher words, nor can we push around, ...but if you want to run errands, slaughter two chickens, get up at five in the morning, sleep in the middle of the night, walk south of the mountain, walk north of the mountain, and say a few words of foreign language (referring to Japanese and Russian), we brothers can still handle it. If you want to keep a secret, we are sealed jars, guaranteed not to let out a trace of air, exchange foreign currency for money, and play dumb, we can all do it. If you want to sell your life and charge into battle, we can do it without hesitation, with a ready pair of hands and two legs..."

These few words of Old Long seem to be nonsense, but all the conditions that Fan Yaoqun selects people can be summarized without omission. I wonder how he can be so thoughtful when speaking impromptu? Impossible. How can he be so on the subject? Probably he walked the inner line beforehand, a small inner line; that's why his speech had a draft.

There are probably more than just Old Long and Wu Rui who can donate their posts as captain and vice captain in the old village. In the eyes of Dragon Fifth Master and Yaoqun, there is at least a list of characters. But Yaoqun's most basic condition for selection is still the word "automatic"; she should not force a designation, which is the false truth; because everyone has their own ideals and difficulties. Old Long and Wu Rui are certainly qualified characters on the list, and now that he has volunteered, it is of course no problem to be selected.

Once the candidates for captain and vice captain are determined, the issue of other squad leaders and team members will be easily solved. As a result, the number of people willing to enter the pass exceeded the planned number by more than double. Old Long could not use special conditions to limit the number of people; everyone was qualified and everyone was friendly. What to do? Old Long is very smooth, he let everyone draw lots, "leave it to fate, take your chances" he divided the eighty-odd bamboo sticks into one, two, two kinds; all those who drew "one" were the first batch. Those who drew "two" were counted as the second batch, and after the first batch arrived at the destination, they would look at the situation and let the second batch listen for news in the old village. In this way, the problem of the number of team members was solved very fairly, and a reserve team was also stipulated incidentally.

After the entire team was determined, Yaoqun discussed official business with Old Long:

### A Wandering Young Girl (Reader's Mailbox)

Dear Editor, I am a twenty-five-year-old woman who has received higher education. My father is the manager of a bank, and my mother is a typical "well-bred lady." My parents only have one child, and I have been spoiled since I was a child. I can be considered a lucky person. But unfortunately, things finally arrived. When I was in college, I met a male classmate. His character, knowledge, and personality all matched the conditions of my ideal partner. We gradually moved from friendship into love.

My family is not new or old. My father is a student who studied abroad, but he still retains some "opposite" thoughts. My mother, on the other hand, is completely a "good person" who always obeys her father and never resists. She always takes a "hands-off" attitude towards her children's affairs.

Our love gradually matured, and of course, a young couple in love always hope to get married soon. But my father has always opposed my marriage. His reason is that my boyfriend is not a son of a "wealthy family" and does not have a Western-style house or a car. Of course, such a person is not worthy of being his son-in-law. Further opposition, he forbade us to communicate and interact with each other. At the same time, he began to find a "quick son-in-law" for me. At that time, I had left school and was working as a "number book clerk" in a primary school with a monthly salary of 220,000 yuan. My lover was just out of school and was working in a company.

As the days went by, my father's coercion became more and more intense, but I still struggled, and only struggle will lead to victory.

On an autumn night, my lover went north and was scheduled to leave the next day. I sneaked out of my house to get to the small room in the apartment where he was staying, and we spent the last night together passionately before parting. At the same time, I gave him the greatest guarantee—I dedicated my sacred virginity to him. My lover left me with a wounded but comforted heart and went to the distant north.

My difficulties finally came, and after a doctor's examination, it was confirmed that I was already a mother—the mother of a child.

In our family, this kind of incident is absolutely not allowed to happen, and my heart is filled with inexplicable terror. Abortion, running away, I can't solve my problem. Dear Editor, I hope you can give me some guidance. Xiu Yuan (Reply will be published tomorrow)

To Mr. Cheng Shengjun in Shanghai: Your illness is chronic bronchitis. As for what medicine you should take, please consult a doctor for a diagnosis and determination. This disease is not serious, but it is quite stubborn; it is difficult to cure if you do not remove the root cause. It is mostly caused by long-term inhalation of dust or irritating gases; people who like to smoke and drink are also often affected; in addition, there is what is called "occupational" bronchitis, which is common among workers such as grinders and textile workers. Strenuous exercise is definitely not advisable.
