### The Government Still Hopes to Resume Peace Talks; Statement Presented to the Chairman for Approval and Release; National Government Executive Yuan Decides on Comprehensive Restructuring

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Chairman Chiang summoned Zhang Junmai and Wu Xianzhe of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zuo Shunsheng and Zeng Qi of the Youth Party, as well as Wang Shijie, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen at 7:00 PM on the 19th to discuss peace talks and government restructuring. Ultimately, two objectives were decided upon for the restructuring of the government: from the National Government Committee to the Executive Yuan, with the immediate expansion of the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Senate, and even the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association. The final decision on how to proceed will be discussed by Zhang Qun with representatives from various parties on the morning of the 20th.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet at his official residence for figures from the Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties in Nanjing at 7:30 PM on the afternoon of the 19th, accompanied by representatives from the Political Consultative Government. Those in attendance included Zhang Junmai, Wu Xianzhe, Wan Renqian, Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, Zeng Qi, Wang Shijie, Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Qun, Wu Dingchang, Yu Dawei, and others. Discussions centered around the restructuring of the government. After the meal, representatives from various parties departed first, while representatives from the Political Consultative Government continued to discuss with the Chairman and study the statement to be released, finalizing the general outline and leaving it for the Chairman's final approval.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 19th] A meeting was held at Sun Ke's residence on the afternoon of the 18th, agreeing that the government should issue a statement, and Lei Zhen was tasked with drafting it. He worked through the night on the 18th and presented the draft to Sun Ke on the morning of the 19th at 10:00 AM for deliberation. Subsequently, at 11:00 AM, he went to the Democratic Socialist Party to meet with Xu Yilin, Jiang Yuntian, and others to discuss the restructuring of the government. According to Xu, what was discussed today regarding the restructuring of the government seemed more concrete because in the past they only spoke of restructuring the central government, but today they discussed restructuring local governments, although the specific methods were not yet discussed. Xu also stated that, for example, in the past, it was the military interfering in politics, but now it is the military maintaining politics. The meeting lasted about an hour, and then Lei went to Longmen Restaurant to host a banquet for figures from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties. Those in attendance included Wu Xianzhe, Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Wan Renqian, and Yang Junmin from the Democratic Socialist Party, and Zeng Qi and Zuo Shunsheng from the Youth Party. The discussions mainly focused on the issue of government restructuring, and the gathering dispersed at 2:00 PM. Lei visited Shao Lizi again at 4:00 PM and then attended the Chairman's banquet at 7:30 PM. [Report from Our Nanjing Office, 19th] The government statement, originally scheduled for release on the 19th, was finalized on the 19th. Because it needed to be presented to the Chairman for final review, the main content did not express closing the door to peace talks regarding the CCP's rejection of peace talks, but still expressed a willingness to resume peace talks. The statement is over a thousand words long and is scheduled to be released on the 20th.

[Report from United Press, Nanjing, 19th] Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, revealed here last night that after the CCP rejected the government's peace proposal, the government decided to issue a formal statement on the 20th, inviting the CCP for a second time to resume peace negotiations, and the CCP could choose the negotiation procedure.

This decision was made at a meeting held at Premier Sun's residence last night. The meeting also decided that this approach should be reviewed by Chairman Chiang at a banquet for leaders of the Kuomintang and the Third Parties before it is adopted.

According to Jiang Yunri, there are four changes to the plan, all related to local governments. As to whether this change in the plan represents a greater concession to the CCP, Jiang declined to comment.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Xu Fulin stated: The Democratic Socialist Party hopes that peace will be achieved soon, and it is regrettable that peace talks have come to a halt. Whether to participate in the government restructuring is still to be discussed and decided after going to Shanghai for a meeting.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Peace talks have been affected due to the Communist Party's rejection. Figures from various parties who came to Nanjing to restore peace talks will go to Shanghai on the 20th, and Jiang Yuntian will go to Anhui.

### Zhang Junmai Visits the Envoy; Zhang Dongsun Arrives in Nanjing, Zhang Shenfu Flies to Peiping

Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties Hold a Unified Stance on the Current Situation

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Zhang Junmai, accompanied by Wu Xianzhe, visited the Envoy at around 10:00 AM on the 19th to discuss the resumption of peace talks, departing after half an hour. In the afternoon, they accepted Bai Chongxi's invitation, and in the afternoon, figures from the Democratic Socialist Party visited twice to discuss their opinions on the current situation. Zhang Dongsun from the Democratic League visited at 4:00 PM, Zhang Qun visited to talk at 5:00 PM, and they visited the Chairman together with Wu Xianzhe at 7:00 PM and immediately attended the Chairman's banquet. Zhang is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 20th.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Ye Duyi, secretary of Zhang Dongsun of the Democratic League, arrived in Nanjing at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th and immediately visited Zhang Junmai. Zhang came to Nanjing this time because the former Envoy had personally asked him to come to Nanjing for a talk if there was an opportunity when he went to Peiping, so he came to fulfill the promise. Zhang is scheduled to meet with the Envoy in the coming days to express his views on the current situation. It is reported that Zhang does not intend to participate in the peace talks and will stay in Nanjing for several days. Furthermore, Zhang Shenfu of the Democratic League left Nanjing by plane for Peiping at 9:00 AM on the 19th. The Democratic League is scheduled to host reporters in Shanghai on the 20th to report on its views on the current situation, its political views, and its criticism of various political consultations over the years. A written report, over 20,000 words long, has been printed. Zhang packed it in a small basket and brought it to Nanjing when he left Shanghai on the 18th, but it was lost at the station due to crowding.

[Report from Our Peiping Office, 19th] Liang Qiushui and Hu Haimen, key members of the Democratic Socialist Party, accompanied by Liu Jingyao, flew back to Peiping from Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th. Mr. Liang told our reporter: (1) I had previously intended to withdraw from the party due to the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly, but because the National Assembly has now become a thing of the past, and there is still room for improvement in the Democratic Socialist Party's policies in the future, and because my friendship with Mr. Zhang Junmai is very deep, I currently do not intend to withdraw from the party again, but I am also not prepared to take on actual work within the party, so although I have been nominated as a Standing Committee member this time, I have personally decided to firmly decline the position. Regarding the Democratic League's notification to the Democratic Socialist Party to withdraw from the Democratic League, Mr. Liang expressed his regret and said that he and Mr. Zhang have been old friends for many years, but unfortunately, when Mr. Zhang arrived in Shanghai, this action by the Democratic League had already become a fait accompli, so when he met with Zhang Lan, he only discussed the weather that night. The reporter also learned that Mr. Hu Haimen is still quite enthusiastic about the Democratic Socialist Party, but he has also withdrawn from the Democratic League, and the Democratic League still retains Mr. Hu's membership.

[Report from Our Peiping Office, 19th] Liang Qiushui, who arrived in Peiping today, said that Chairman Chiang will invite Zhang Junmai to discuss the peace talk plan tomorrow. According to what Mr. Liang heard, the draft peace talk plan proposed by the government is as follows: (1) To resume peace talks, whether the government sends representatives to Yan'an or the Communist Party sends representatives to Nanjing is to be chosen by the Communist Party. (2) To convene a round table conference for direct negotiations, with two representatives from the Kuomintang and the Communist Party each, and one representative from each of the other parties participating. (3) Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party issue cease-fire orders. (4) On the issue of local government, the government will make the greatest possible concessions to meet 80% of the Communist Party's demands. However, it is feared that this point will only succeed if the Communist Party also makes slight concessions.

[Report from Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 19th] Zuo Shunsheng, spokesman for the Youth Party, commented on the CCP's rejection of the government's new peace plan, saying: This move by the CCP is not surprising. Regarding the restructuring of the government, the Youth Party does not intend to make a unilateral decision and will act in concert with the Democratic Socialist Party.

### Zhang Shenfu Talks About the Current Situation

The Overall Situation is Expected to Improve in Early March

[Report from Our Peiping Office, 19th] Zhang Shenfu arrived in Peiping by plane from Nanjing on the afternoon of the 19th. Zhang told reporters: There is no hope of success for the recent peace talks because both sides lack the determination for peace and do not trust each other. In his observation, the overall situation in China should improve before the end of February or early March this year, because by then the military strength of both sides will be able to produce some results, and both sides may have a clearer understanding. Moreover, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference is imminent, and if a solution is not sought independently, international pressure will follow. Mr. Zhang continued: The round table conference advocated by Premier Sun is an informal meeting of various parties. Even if the results are satisfactory, the Political Consultative Conference must be reopened in late February or early March. In response to reporters' questions, he stated that Sun Ke and Lei Zhen did not contact the Democratic League during their trip to Shanghai. He only made informal contact with both sides during his trip from Shanghai to Nanjing. The Democratic League still hopes to facilitate peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

[Report from United Press, Paris, 18th] Qian Tai, the Chinese Ambassador to France, issued a statement here today demanding sovereignty over the Xisha Islands. According to reports, the islands were occupied by Chinese troops approximately three weeks ago.

The statement also stated that China has had sovereignty over the islands since ancient times. According to reports, France recently stated in New York that although France and the Viet Minh government currently have disputes, France still believes that sovereignty over the Xisha Islands should belong to Vietnam.

[Report from United Press, Honolulu, 19th] After resting in the Hawaiian sunshine for ten days, Secretary of State Marshall boarded a plane tonight to go to the United States to take office. Marshal left on a specially prepared C-54 Army transport plane and will land in Burbank, California. He plans to stay in Hollywood with Secretary of the Navy McCathy for a day on Sunday. Marshal refused to comment on international events. When asked about the Chinese Communist Party's rejection of resuming peace talks, Marshal replied, "I don't know if I will make a public statement on the overall situation in China until I have met and talked with the President." When asked about the plan to merge the U.S. Army and Navy, Marshal said, "Marshal Eisenhower and the Secretary of the Army can handle this matter."

[Report from United Press, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall will be sworn in at the White House at 4:00 PM (standard time) on the 20th.

Mr. Byrnes will attend the inauguration of new Secretary of State Marshall on the 20th and will go to his hometown of Spasburg, South Carolina, that night after meeting with him. On the one hand, Marshal has been considering future personnel issues in the State Department while taking a short break in Honolulu. All senior officials of the State Department have submitted their resignations to the President as usual so that Marshal can freely choose personnel.

In terms of diplomatic envoys, Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt has long intended to resign, and Ambassador to China Stuart may not be able to hold his position for long, but no decision will be made until Marshal and President Truman review the situation in China.

### The Case of Ms. Shen Chong Being Raped; American Judges Are Fair and Impartial; The Military Court Will Continue the Trial Today

[Report from Our Peiping Office, 19th] The public trial of the American soldier's violence has been going on for two days. The American military court is scheduled to continue the trial on the 20th. According to the testimony of various Chinese witnesses, there is no doubt that the American soldier committed rape. However, because the defendant's defense attorney has been making things difficult and inducing confessions, trying to find loopholes, and the initial examination report of Wang Hecheng, the director of the police hospital, has many twists and turns in its wording, it has not been determined to be rape. At the same time, the American examining doctor has not yet appeared in court, so all parties believe that the future of the case is not entirely optimistic. However, there have been several phenomena in the court in the past two days that can reverse the accusations and doubts of society, that is, the fairness and impartiality of the American prosecuting judge. Some of his speeches are sufficient to represent the protection of the interests of the victims, which has won our praise. Furthermore, the degree to which Mayor He Siyuan and Prosecutor Ji Yuan of the Peiping District Court are concerned about the interests of the victims can also dispel the initial criticism of the government's handling of the situation by some people in society. In the past few days, except for the United Association of Universities in Peiping Protesting the Violence of American Soldiers, which expressed that the number of listeners was too small, no other dissatisfaction or backlash has been heard. Pierson has been sitting in the defendant's seat all along, and his actions are guarded by American soldiers with guns. Yesterday, reporters tried to talk to him about his name, origin, and educational level, but were rejected by the guards. His impatient attitude seemed that he had not received higher education or came from a remote village. The symbol of the unit he wore before committing the crime has been completely removed, and his fear is overflowing in his words. His defense attorney, who is also the chief of staff of his unit, and the prosecuting judge are regarded as evenly matched. Among our witnesses, Ms. Shen's answers were the best. Her attitude was serious and calm, and she did not give Pierson's defense attorney a chance to induce a cunning confession, which made the listeners who were sweating for this insulted girl say that it was unexpected. Shen's father supported his daughter to appear in court, and his face showed comfort. Whether Shen Chong will continue to study at Peking University has not yet been decided. Hu Shi, who listened for two mornings, remained silent and listened quietly. He Siyuan frequently whispered "incompetent" and changed his seat several times when his subordinate doctors repeatedly answered inappropriately. Up to now, there is a doubt in this case that has not yet been resolved, that is, where is the other American soldier who assisted in the violence!

[Report from United Press, Peiping, 19th] The newspapers in North China expressed strong dissatisfaction with the "American Military Rape of a Chinese Female Student" case. The American military court will continue the hearing on the morning of the 20th and will interrogate two other witnesses, one is the American military police who captured Pierson at the time, and the other is a naval doctor who examined Ms. Shen with Dr. Wang Hecheng. According to unconfirmed reports, another American soldier (whose name has not yet been released) will also be interrogated.

### From Shenyang to the Liaodong Peninsula

— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao

Going from Pan Yang to the Liaodong Peninsula, the most stimulating thing to the eyes along the way is destruction, destruction, destruction. Destruction is everywhere, old scars and new wounds, and it never leaves the eyes.

South of Gaiping, the crooked power poles, with the cut wires, are like a woman with thousands of strands of loose hair, quietly lying in the open fields. The single-track railway that has been rebuilt, the train is like an old cow, it is very difficult to walk. North and south of Xiongyue, there are also fires gathered together, which are workers repairing roads roasting, seeking warmth, so as to get some warmth in the ice and snow.

The China Changchun Railway

Generally, people are dissatisfied with the China Changchun Railway. The train is not orderly and there is no heating in the car. This is a great threat and pain to the travelers in minus 20 degrees Celsius. The accumulation of road police makes people even more frightened. Oppression and inspection can be seen everywhere. At the Dashiqiao station, five or six people were pulled into the road police room from the crowd of passengers, stripped of their clothes, and searched for their belongings. It took a long time and there were no results.

Several National Army soldiers looked at it uncomfortably, walked into Gaiping, and passed Taiyue. The Wafangdian is in sight. The Northeast Security Commander's Office sent an engineering team to cooperate and rush to repair it together, so that it can be connected to the terminal Dalian as soon as possible.

Apple City

When approaching Gaiping, pieces of fruit tree forests appeared in front of us. Xiongyue is even more connected to one piece after another. It is the world-famous apple orchard. Xiongyue is the most famous, and Gaiping is not bad. According to statistics from Gaiping County, the apple cultivation area reaches 105,000 mu, and the average annual output is 25 million kilograms. The Japanese set up research institutions for apples and invested a lot of money to cultivate more than 70 kinds of fruits, "Hongyu", "Guoguang", "Weijin"... Sweet, crispy, banana-flavored, lemon-flavored, all have been well-known and popular, and the color and fragrance are moving, which is wonderful. But the apple orchard is now in unspeakable sadness, because it has not escaped the disaster of "reception disputes". In front of an apple orchard across from Gaiping Station, the reporter saw a wooden sign erected by the "Northeast Real Estate Administration" to receive it, and then saw some wooden signs received by other agencies in other places. In addition, local people told reporters about the receiving fruit garden agencies, which is really a lot.

Look: New First Army, New Sixth Army, Sanatorium for the Wounded and Sick Soldiers of the Commander's Office, Transportation Department, Unified Reception Committee, Production Administration, Provincial Government, County Government, and the most wonderful thing is a "Cultural Service Society". Xiongyue is also the same situation. Local people said: For the enemy's puppet apple orchard, it is hoped that the county government will receive it, so as to enrich the tax source and manage it nearby.

The reporter ate the famous crispy apple called "Hongyu" in Xiongyue and wandered in front of the apple forest on a moonlit night. Sympathizing with the sadness of the apple forest, a kind of inexplicable sadness attacked my heart. I saw the vision of cultivating and managing the apple forest in the future. How can people not be uneasy? The most complicated hope is that "reasonable reception" can be achieved, and real efforts will be made to cultivate and develop it. A person from Dalian talked to the reporter about the apple forest in Dalian, and the first sentence was sighed and said: "The apple orchard in Dalian is finished." "The reason is that after the restoration, there was no special insecticide and fertilizer powder made by the Japanese, and there was no good management at the time. I watched the fruit trees wither and be destroyed." In the reporter's opinion, the government should restore the research institutions as soon as possible and guide and improve all state-owned and private apple orchards well. The long-famous apple will have a good future. (To be continued on the second page)

### The Joint Communist Army of Shandong Exceeds 400,000, Besieging Zaozhuang and Jinxiang in Increasing Urgency. National Army Troops Stationed at Niushan Station on the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th] The number of Communist troops currently in Shandong Province has increased to approximately 460,000. The majority of the main force is participating in the war in southern Shandong. Although the remaining forces distributed in various areas have not launched battles, they are being transferred day and night, indicating a major plan. The National Army is ensuring the security of Jinan, Qingdao, and the stations along the Jiaoji Railway. Recently, the Communist army has repeatedly damaged transportation, but repairs have been immediately carried out. Local attacks have also been repelled by the National Army, stabilizing public morale. Business on the Jiaoji Railway is excellent. According to reports received by the government, the Communist army intends to attempt to invade Jinan during the Lunar New Year. The National Army is strictly guarding against this, and there should be no problems. Approximately 200,000 Communist troops are located on the southern side of the Jiaoji Railway, mostly original forces without significant changes. The number of Communist troops south of Zibo has increased, seemingly with the intention of invading the mining area.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 19th] Although the front line in southern Shandong has been experiencing continuous rain and snow, the Communist army's offensive remains fierce. The Communist troops reinforcing the attack on Zaozhuang and Qicun were defeated on the 18th. The National Army is currently holding firm in both locations, and the strength of the National Army reinforcements is growing daily, soon able to relieve the siege.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 19th] The 3rd, 6th, 7th, and other columns of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces have been besieging Jinxiang for days. The defending troops are calmly resisting, and the battle is fierce. Due to the Communist army's blockade, the city's firewood and charcoal are now exhausted, and nearly all houses have been demolished. Two to three hundred residents have already starved to death, urgently requiring rescue. The National Army on the east bank of the Wanfu River has recovered Weilou and Lilou, located seven to eight li east of Jinxiang. Fierce fighting continues in the Mengpu and Xiangudian areas, more than ten li southwest of the city.

[Our Newspaper, Xinpu, 18th] The National Army troops from Shuyang and Haizhou have successively recovered both Niushan and Baitibu stations on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and are advancing towards Ahu Station.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th] Although the Communist army south of the Longhai Railway in northern Jiangsu is still struggling desperately, the overall situation has passed, and they are no longer a threat to the area. The National Army, which recovered Longjuzhen, arrived at Fangshan on the 17th and entered Niushan Station on the Longhai Railway that day. The Communist army was unable to resist and fled in disarray. The National Army previously stationed at Hamadun also reached Chengtou near the Longhai Railway on the 17th and made contact with the National Army stationed at Niushan Station.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th] The Communist army on the east bank of the Grand Canal is currently fleeing north in multiple directions. A unit of the National Army advanced north from Yinping and reached Chaliu on the 16th, entering Gaoliu on the 17th. The 9th regiment of the Communist 7th division has fled south. Another unit of the National Army recovered Wangjiafangzi and Tasha and other places on the 17th.

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense announced: The Communist army in northern Jiangsu on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway can be cleared around the Lunar New Year. The National Army is advancing north, making progress of twenty to thirty miles daily. However, the battle situation in southern Shandong is still difficult to predict, and there will be no changes in two or three days. The Communist army is fiercely attacking Zaozhuang.

Li Jifu Sits in Huaiyin

[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin, 19th] General Li Jifu, Deputy Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, has taken up residence in Huaiyin due to the unfolding situation in northern Jiangsu, to facilitate nearby command. When this reporter visited today, inquiring about his opinions on the recent military situation in northern Jiangsu, he stated: The battles in the Taierzhuang and Zaozhuang areas have slowed down, fighting when advantageous and exploiting gaps, which is the Communist army's consistent tactic. The Communist army near the Longhai Railway still has a force of twenty to thirty thousand. However, with the National Army's favorable position, clearing the entire line is a matter of time. He believes that stability is the priority for administration in the recovered areas, with the minimum requirement being ensuring the people have food to eat.

### The National Army's Counterattacks Are Winning Victories Repeatedly. Communist Forces on the Jichang Line are Cleared. The Damaged Railway is Being Repaired, and Bridge Repairs are Being Hastened.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 18th] Military News: The He Wanzi station on the Jichang Railway was briefly disrupted by a small group of Communist troops. The station office was burned, killing three staff members and injuring two. At the same time, the railway was damaged for two kilometers east of the station and a bridge half a kilometer west was burned down. Telephone lines along the road were also cut. After the National Army counterattacked on the 16th and 17th, the Communist troops retreated. Currently, all Communist troops along the Jichang Railway have been cleared. The section of railway east of Hewanzi that was dismantled was repaired by noon on the 17th, and repairs to the burned bridge are also being hastened. Today, passenger trains on the Jichang Railway departed from both locations towards Hewanzi. Once the bridge is repaired, direct passage will be possible.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 19th] The heavy oil express train with the highest speed between Changchun and Shenyang departed from Shenyang yesterday morning, but has not yet arrived in Changchun this afternoon. The reason for the delay is reportedly not due to insufficient fuel or any obstacles on the route. Traffic is still very smooth, and a passenger train departed from Changchun south this morning.

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense announced today: The National Army in the Northeast has launched a counteroffensive since the 15th of this month. One army has advanced to 50 kilometers south of the Songhua River. The Communist army's offensive against Changchun has been repelled by the National Army, and the National Army is recovering lost ground.

### Food is Extremely Difficult in the Overseas Chinese District of Vietnam

CNA Reporter Visited

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 19th] This CNA reporter, with the approval of the Vietnamese side, went to the Overseas Chinese area of Vietnam yesterday and returned this morning. This is the first time this reporter has gone to the area since December 19 of last year. The most major difficulty in the area currently is the lack of food, water, and medicine. There are currently 4,000 Overseas Chinese housed in the Overseas Chinese concentration point in the area. Due to the lack of food and water, they are only eating corn. The area is extremely unclean, and many children are suffering from smallpox as a result, but there is no smallpox vaccine to plant. Our Consul General Yuan Zijian asked the French-Vietnamese to negotiate to transport some more Overseas Chinese out of the Overseas Chinese area. The general situation of the Overseas Chinese in the French-controlled area is unchanged. A relief committee has now been organized to supply the Overseas Chinese with rice and medicine. There are 1,138 Overseas Chinese in Hanoi, housed in the committee's houses. Overseas Chinese in Haiphong responded to the relief efforts for the struggling compatriots in Hanoi. All funds raised will be used to purchase rice and transport it here. Consul General Yuan said today that the central government has allocated 2 million Vietnamese dong to relieve the Overseas Chinese in Tonkin and Annam. How to use the funds is still subject to the committee and the French government reaching an agreement so that the funds can be distributed to the Overseas Chinese in the city.

[French News Agency, Hanoi, 19th] The Chinese consular authorities here are continuing negotiations to evacuate the Overseas Chinese in the besieged area of Hanoi, and hope that the French army will not conduct military operations in the area to avoid losses to Overseas Chinese property.

### U.S. Military Expenses in China Reach Millions of Dollars Per Month, Admiral Cooke's Remarks in Qingdao

[Our City News] Admiral Cooke said in an interview with reporters in Qingdao: The expenses of the U.S. Army and Navy in China are one million U.S. dollars per month, especially the Navy's spending is the greatest. The United States hopes that China can establish a good navy and is willing to assist China in completing this task, but training the navy requires a lot of funding and cannot be done overnight. The value of the materials shipped by the U.S. government to China for the use of the Central Navy Training Corps is 1.5 billion national currency. (It is reported that our government allocated 100 million national currency to the corps for start-up expenses.)

There are currently 26 ships transferred to our country, most of which are landing ships, weighing 60,000 tons. The corps has trained more than 2,000 students, all of whom have been sent to serve at sea. The U.S. military director of the corps is Colonel Keating, and the deputy school officer is Colonel Heerbronat. Our naval director is Colonel Lin Xiangguang, who returned from the United States. All are experienced naval personnel.

### From Shenyang to the Far East Peninsula - Continued from First Page

Saline-Alkali Land - Seacoast: Farming is extremely difficult due to soil conditions, but there are benefits from fish and salt. Regarding the yield of fish and shellfish, the Xuanping area alone produces eight million catties annually, a so-called "small sea" loss. They always go one after another on the highway connecting Gaiping and Yingkou.

The reporter took a horse-drawn carriage from Gaiping to Yingkou. In the seventy-li journey, where the cold wind stung the skin, because the sea was frozen, no vendors carrying fish and shrimp were seen. What was seen were large carts carrying apples and peanuts from Xiong Yue to Yingkou, as well as firewood and grain from Gaiping to Yingkou. The returning carts were full of reed mats and salt products.

Not far from Gaiping, one enters the alkaline land. Without cultivation, the frozen wilderness is covered with a layer of white powder. Between Gaiping and Yingkou, one can see the boundless salt flats. A light railway with well-constructed roadbeds runs vertically and horizontally between Dalian and Yingkou. This is a means of transportation built specifically for transporting salt products. Now, many of the rails have been dismantled, and the equipment has been damaged.

The salt flats called Yancheng are equipped with underground water pipes running vertically and horizontally, and station houses managing the water pipes belong to the electrical construction, and are generally there. The substation in the salt flats has been damaged to about 30% of its capacity, so it can still be repaired. According to a responsible person from the "Northeast District Yinggai Salt Field Office of the Ministry of Finance," they are now carrying out the project of repairing the substation, so that the highest output of the Yinggai Salt Field, which uses electric power to pump seawater for salt production, is said to be 6 million dan. This can supply all the salt needs of the nine northeastern provinces and two cities. There are also large amounts of salt produced in other places, so the Japanese once tried to use the salt for industrial purposes, such as the "Kanto Prefecture Gary Industry Factory" in Pulandian, etc. These were all facilities for the large-scale use of seawater and salt, and they also achieved great success.

The Yinggai Salt Field has now been taken over by the Northeast District Yinggai Salt Field Office of the Ministry of Finance. Everyone is watching with wide eyes, looking at the Office's restoration and expansion of the salt field.

From a distance, Yingkou Port can see numerous tall chimneys, water towers, and factory buildings in Yingkou. The long city street, standing on the sea embankment and estuary, presents an extraordinary appearance. However, upon entering the urban area, the old buildings and narrow streets appear somewhat outdated. The transportation in the city now consists only of a few tricycles and horse-drawn carriages, aside from the two old cars used by the mayor and the chief of the maritime police局, which further intensifies the atmosphere of decrepitude.

Even the estuary freezes several feet deep, and the harbor is also sealed off. Yingkou has become depressed. A long street of about fifteen li, starting from the east at the railway station and ending in the west at Xida Temple, is long enough, but the road is uneven, and old-fashioned shops line both sides of the road. At night, a dim electric light in front of each house weakly illuminates the dark road.

There are some new buildings along the river and near the station, but most of them have been damaged. Apart from the "China Textile Company," which has restored 30,000 spindles, there is also a "Yingkou Paper Mill," which can produce one and a half tons of semi-glazed paper per day, and the "East Asia Tobacco Company," etc., whose factories are progressing slightly. Most of the other factories have not yet started operating.

Yingkou has been entered and exited twice by the Nationalists and Communists. Several good buildings still retain the remnants of bullet-riddled traces. Everything needs to be rectified and constructed. Mayor Sun Zhentao indicated that if financial resources are available in the future, they will definitely put great effort into construction. The business tax is the most promising source of revenue.

Yingkou's commerce and industry both depend on the sea river and land transportation. The railway can connect Shenyang and Dalian to the south via Dashiqiao. Sea river transportation must wait until after the thaw. Last September, ships from Shanghai arrived; in October, 3,000-ton ships came; and in November, many ships also came. "China Merchants," "Shaoxing," and other company ships all arrived. The authorities have decided to start building the port immediately after the thaw in order to open up Northeast maritime transportation, which is very important.

Across the river, the "Gouying Branch Line" that leads to Goubangzi on the Beining Road can now only run from Goubangzi to Dawa. Over one hundred li of damaged railway from Dawa to the opposite bank of Yingkou still needs to be repaired. After the repair, it will be of great help to commerce. If the Liao River can be used for transportation, there is also a way. In addition, there is an airfield that also needs to be repaired. Everything requires this year's effort. (The End)

Editorial

### After the Chinese Communists Refused Peace Talks

Since the government drafted a new plan to resume peace talks, intending to send General Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an to discuss it, the people of the whole country fully believed that the Chinese Communists would definitely welcome it, so that both parties could negotiate sincerely and break the current deadlock. However, according to news from Nanjing, the attitude of the Chinese Communists remains unchanged, still "The Chinese Communists insist on abolishing the constitution and restoring the military position of January 13th of last year as the basis for resuming peace talks. If the government cannot accept these two conditions, then the government does not need to send personnel to Yan'an; conversely, if it can be accepted, then the Chinese Communists can send personnel to Nanjing to negotiate with the government." Thus, the door to peace talks, which was opened, has been completely closed by the Chinese Communists again, instantly turning the glimmer of hope in the eyes of our common people into nothing.

News about resuming peace talks has continued to be heard since the successful conclusion of the National Assembly, but it is as elusive as spring creepers. Later, in Nanjing and Shanghai, it became increasingly prevalent, and the atmosphere of peace talks became more intense and gradually materialized. First, Mr. Peng Xuepei gave a speech in Nanjing on the 9th, stating that the government was very willing to negotiate sincerely with the Chinese Communists. Mr. Sun Ke also gave a proposal in Shanghai on the 10th, advocating that all parties should immediately hold a roundtable conference. All parties attached importance to the speeches of Peng and Sun, but only the Chinese Communists had a unique objection, saying that the focus of resuming peace talks was not the method of peace talks, but the opinions of both parties on the issues. On the one hand, the Chinese Communists stated their attitude, insisting on the above two conditions, and on the other hand, they probed the government's opinions on these two conditions. In order to quickly resume peace talks, the government also drafted a new plan to resume peace talks, with four principles: (1) Regarding the method of peace talks, whether the government sends personnel to Yan'an or the Chinese Communists send personnel to Nanjing for negotiation, whether it is a roundtable conference or other methods, all are acceptable. (2) Immediately cease conflict on the spot; (3) The consolidation of troops and the restoration of transportation should be handled in accordance with the previous agreements; (4) The issue of local governments should also be resolved in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. No matter from which angle we observe, none of these four principles is not a representation of the government's concessions to the Chinese Communists. The government not only has sincerity in resuming peace talks, but also has a great determination to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, which can all be seen here. The government's sending of General Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an for negotiation was also the most appropriate choice of personnel, but it was rejected by the Chinese Communists, which is really puzzling!

Special Envoy Marshall came to China to mediate the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists for eleven months. Regardless of his superhuman wisdom, his tactics of winning a hundred battles, and his unshakable confidence and perseverance, he still failed to help the Chinese people achieve peace. What is the reason? According to the statement he issued when he left China and returned to his country, the crux of the matter in the evolution of the current situation in China lies in the mutual suspicion between the Nationalists and Communists. At the same time, he pointed out that the Chinese Communists "completely distrust the leaders of the Kuomintang, and they seem to believe that all proposals put forward by the government are used to overthrow the Communist Party." The main reason why it is difficult to resume peace talks this time is still here. The editorial of this newspaper on the 13th pointed out that resuming peace talks should be preceded by eliminating suspicion and should be emphasized by treating each other with sincerity. After reading the speech of the person in charge of the Chinese Communists published in this newspaper yesterday, I am even more convinced that the twists and turns in resuming peace talks are really due to the lack of sincerity of the Chinese Communists and their failure to eliminate their suspicion of the government. The person in charge of the Chinese Communists actually said: "We have completely lost trust in the long-rumored peace talks; unless the constitution is abolished and the military position of January 13th of last year is restored, it cannot be proved that the government is not deceiving." Since the Chinese Communists cannot treat each other with sincerity and negotiate sincerely, peace talks cannot be resumed. As the saying goes, without sincerity, there is nothing. Even if peace talks are reluctantly resumed, I am afraid that nothing will come of them? But can national affairs be allowed to be delayed like this?

What the people of the whole country unanimously expect is the realization of "peaceful unification, democratic nation-building." Even if there are differences in political views between the Nationalists and Communists, they should be no different from the common aspirations of the people of the whole country. Moreover, the Program for Peaceful National Construction and the Plan for the Reorganization and Unified Compilation of the National Army were both signed and established with the consent of both parties. Now, as long as they are put into practice, the common aspirations of the people can be realized. As for the constitution passed by the National Assembly, it was really drafted in accordance with the principles of the Political Consultative Conference on amending the constitution. Marshal Marshall also said in his statement, "Most of the major parts are in line with the principles determined by the Political Consultative Conference." Although the Chinese Communists did not attend the National Assembly to participate in the constitutional work, their opinions on the constitution are also included. Now, even if there are still opinions, they can participate in the election of National Assembly representatives and amend the new constitution through legal procedures. Why must they insist on the prejudice of abolishing the constitution?

The new constitution is scheduled to be implemented on December 25th of this year. Now is the eve of the implementation of the constitution. All necessary preparations need to be started urgently. Moreover, whether the preparations are sufficient or not has a great relationship with the party's relationship with the government in the future. Therefore, we must not miss the opportunity and let it pass in vain. Since the resumption of peace talks has been rejected by the Chinese Communists and cannot be realized immediately, the government should give play to the spirit of "doing its best." Without waiting for the resumption of peace talks, it must first reorganize the government. Other parties, the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, who attended the National Assembly and participated in the constitutional work, should participate in the reorganization of the government with sincerity and actively prepare for the implementation of the constitution, so that China's politics can move onto the right track of democratic constitutionalism as soon as possible. For the Chinese Communists, regardless of their attitude, they should always retain the seats they deserve and wait for them to have a thorough awakening. If the Chinese Communists are stubborn and never want to give up their attempt to divide the country by force, they will be abandoned by the people of the whole country. At that time, the government will of course not have the necessity to have this kind of political party that violates the will of the people participate in the reorganized government.

In short, this year is our country's year of democratic constitutionalism. The constitution must be implemented by December 25th. Time waits for no one. The work of preparing for the implementation of constitutional government urgently needs to be started now. Therefore, we advocate: we must not delay the reorganization of the government by resuming peace talks, and we must not make the resumption of peace talks a prerequisite for the reorganization of the government, so that the reorganization of the government is fundamentally impossible.

### After the Yellow River Breach is Blocked in Henan Province, Specific Discussions on the Rebirth of the Affected Areas – An Overall Plan Can Be Formulated in the Short Term

[Report from Zhengzhou] As the blocking of the Huayuankou breach is approaching completion, the Henan Provincial Government, the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Henan Office of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are inviting relevant ministries and commissions of the Central Government, charitable organizations, and relevant Henan provincial agencies for specific discussions on the reconstruction of the Yellow River affected areas. The scope of discussion includes (1) public welfare in the affected areas, (2) rural construction in the affected areas, (3) agricultural rehabilitation in the affected areas, (4) industrial rehabilitation in the affected areas, (5) education in the affected areas, and (6) other related issues. It is reported that an overall plan can be formulated in the short term for separate implementation. Regarding the river channels in the affected areas, they should be quickly reorganized after the breach is blocked. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has dispatched survey teams to conduct surveys. The reorganization plan will first restore the original state of the six rivers, the Jialu River, the Sha River, the Wo River, the Wei River, the Ci River, and the Sanqi River, and divert water from the upper reaches of the Jialu River, through Kaifeng to Bengbu, to make it navigable without obstacles. At the same time, the waters of each river can be used to irrigate farmland, and then to navigate and generate electricity. On the negative side, it seeks to reduce disasters; on the positive side, it supports industrial development, which will be of great benefit to the construction of the affected areas and even the entire Henan province. It is reported that this river reorganization plan has been approved in principle by the Central Government, but some technical issues still need to be carefully designed by the Yellow River Management Team before implementation. In addition, 60 billion yuan is required for the reorganization of the river channels, and it is being submitted to the Central Government for approval. In addition, the total amount of agricultural loans for the affected areas and disaster areas in Henan Province in the 36th year of the Republic of China is 16.6 billion yuan, of which 9.6 billion yuan is used as seed loans and 7 billion yuan as plow cattle loans, which are distributed to various counties according to the severity of the disaster. The Henan Provincial Government bears 20% of all loans, and the China Farmers Bank bears 80%. As for housing loans, which were originally one of the agricultural loan projects in the affected areas and disaster areas this year, after consultation, the China Farmers Bank believes that there are many issues involved and has decided to postpone them for the time being.

### Residual Bandits Plotting Troubles on the Border Between Southern Zhejiang, Wenzhou, and Taizhou – The Kuocang Pacification Office is Preparing to Suppress Them

[Report from Wenzhou] More than 200 remnants of bandit gangs, including the remnants of bandit Yu Biao, Zheng Meixin, Chou Shuqing, and Hu Jingjian, are wandering in the border areas of Yongjia, Yueqing, Huangyan, and Xianju counties in southern Zhejiang. The 4th Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Corps has been stationed in Yongjia and Yueqing counties to search and suppress them at any time. The bandit leaders know that they cannot gain a foothold and have fled to the islands one after another. According to recent intelligence, the gang of bandits will carry out large-scale activities in the counties on the border between southern Zhejiang, Wenzhou, and Taizhou, and intend to take the opportunity to disrupt social order. It is heard that many instructors have been sent from northern Jiangsu, and they need to secretly come to Yongjia, intending to establish a detachment in the mountainous area of Yueqing, and two detachments in Yongjia and other places. In addition to some of the guns that have been secretly transported recently, the rest will use the guns stored in the mountainous area of Yongjia last year and recover them for use. The Kuocang Pacification Office is now directing the troops of various counties, striving to eliminate these bandits in the short term so as to avoid causing trouble to the local area.

### Merchant Ships in Lake Ge Encountered Robbers – Seven People Strangled to Death

### Mom: Where Are You?

Tearful Words of a Northern Jiangsu Military Officer Seeking His Loving Mother

Mom: You have suffered enough! Since Dad fled, our home has suffered unparalleled disasters. You, Mom, braved the torrent of this disaster and rushed to another foreign land - Shanghai, living a miserable life, leaving an eight-year-old child to live under the warm door of others, watching the spring flowers bloom, it is someone else's spring.

Was it the late autumn of 1937? The wildfire of invasion burned the child's soul. Looking at the aged Grandpa, Grandma, and loving Aunt, wiping away tears of bitterness, I left my warm hometown and entered the anti-Japanese war camp, determined with the idea of ​​"I swear not to return alive until the Japanese invaders are destroyed." In the past nine years, in the whirlpool of war, the child fell and struggled to get up again. A broken heart has been rolling in the thorns, stabbed bloody, and never touched by the finger of a relative. In order not to fail Dad's will and your old man's earnest instructions, I can only endure all the bitterness and march towards the journey of anti-Japanese war. Today, on the anniversary of the Japanese invaders' surrender and victory, the child comes from the distant front to the homeland of enemy bandits - Huaian, with a hot heart to comfort all relatives! Alas! Who would have thought that there would be no relatives of the child in his hometown? Grandpa and Grandma have both passed away! Aunt has also left this world forever! Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Shanghai... I have searched all the places the child knows! I can't find my mother's whereabouts. In addition to receiving a message from his maternal grandfather at the military academy in the 30th year of the Republic of China, the child has never received a letter from a closer person. The child is too lonely! I need my mother's passionate love to warm this withering heart! Mom! Where are you? Sincerely, Liu Shoubai, a wanderer who hasn't seen you in nine years. Mailing address: Liu Shiqing, No. 2 Huangmiao Lane, Zhongcheng Street, Sizhou, Anhui, transfers the letter."

### The Depression of Packaging Workers

We are laborers at the EWO Packing Factory. We have been in the factory for twenty years. Since the Japanese devils invaded, all of us workers have not received any relief from the factory. It can be said that we have suffered for eight years. Fortunately, we have now won the victory, and we can all stand up. But we are still living in hardship, working like cows and horses all day long! The regrettable thing is that our wages have always been lower than those of other warehouses. This is a special situation of our factory, and our wages are often deducted. On "Christmas," the wages were suddenly reduced from 500 yuan per piece to 400 yuan per piece. When asked about the accountant, no one paid attention. The foreman also did not give a good answer. If we want to meet with the comprador to talk, we are not qualified. If we stop working, it is considered malingering, and we are extremely depressed. I am writing this out and asking Mr. to publish it on our behalf! (Fan Wu)

### A Terrible Memory

Reading your newspaper, I learned that the case of Mikimura Haruyoshi, the captain of the enemy military police in Changshu, is about to end, but Mikimura Haruyoshi is stubbornly denying it, which is very reasonable, please allow me to explain in detail.

Now, I am holding my trembling and fearful heart to describe the terrible memories of the past. During the 32nd year of the Republic of China, I was falsely accused by someone and arrested by the Changshu military police. At that time, the hawks and dogs who captured us Chinese were the Han traitors Wang translator and Katayama, with Captain Kawano as the main movers. Several military police and several unknown brutal Chinese (presumably local people) went out to capture us together. After being arrested, they used brutal torture to force me to confess.

In the meantime, the most vicious torture I have seen and heard is selected and told below. One kind is to use dogs to bite people, release vicious dogs, and drive the prisoners on the scene (at that time in his horse shed). Pieces of flesh and blood were torn off by the vicious dogs. We screamed miserably, and the Japanese gendarmerie took pleasure in it and forbade us to cry, and our hearts were broken every inch. Another type was to be nailed to the door with nails and slowly tortured to death, or tied to a pillar, allowing people to come and go to add a bayonet or punch. This kind of torture was used to kill people. Another type was to be buried alive. At night, they were loaded into black awning cars and driven to the suburbs. Other tortures such as electric shock and fire torture cannot be described in detail.

However, who committed these crimes? Captain Mikimura was the behind-the-scenes person, and the direct executioners were the Han traitor Wang translator, Captain Kawano, and Katayama. Too many people were tortured and sacrificed in their hands. Their footprints are all over Changtai, and everyone knows that Kawano Katayama and Wang translator are real killing demons. Even today, mentioning their names still makes people tremble with fear. Everyone criticized them as being red-faced, while Mikimura at that time was only playing the role of a white-faced person. He certainly did not personally kill anyone, or beat us even once. He often pretended to be concerned to coax us. At that time, we could only pretend to be sympathetic to him on our faces.

But now in the case, Mikimura does not admit to killing people, but the case has never been brought to Kawano, Katayama, Wang translator and others for joint trial. Wang translator slipped away, and he cannot be caught in his own country, which is surprising and pessimistic. Seeing the news of Mikimura's trial, I remembered my old grievances, and I have to provide my views to help judge this fact. Finally, I hope that your newspaper can report the grievances of this poor man who is unable to appear in court in a service-oriented position to help the High Court conduct the trial. (Gu Biao)

### By Mail

Reply to Mr. Chen Shishi: (1) (A) The second phase of the review by the Municipal Bureau of Education has ended. Although there are plans to hold the third phase, the time is yet to be determined. (B) If other provincial and municipal education bureaus are currently handling reviews, students in this city can submit a request to the Municipal Bureau of Education to forward a letter of entrustment.

(2) If a private middle school has submitted a request to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval of registration before the war, the diploma it issues is still valid even if it has not been reviewed. If the private middle school was not registered before the war or was a school established by the enemy and puppets, the diploma it issues is invalid before it has been reviewed.

(3) Students with equivalent academic qualifications can apply for the first semester of the first year of high school.

(4) Except for applying for the first semester of the first year of a junior college or higher or the first semester of the first year of high school with equivalent academic qualifications, there are no other good strategies.

### The German Question Is Complicated and the Four Countries Have Different Opinions. Foreign Minister Representatives Engaged in Extracurricular Activities Yesterday. Small Countries Were Invited to Attend and Expressed Their Views on the Austrian Treaty Separately.

[Reuters London, 19th] Although there were no formal meetings of the four foreign minister representatives over the weekend, extracurricular activities were still extremely busy. The drafting committee of the Austrian question representatives was busy preparing a draft of the preamble to the Austrian treaty. Expert advisors from the three powers of Britain, the United States, and France will draft the political clauses of the Austrian treaty on Monday morning. Representatives and advisors discussing the German question have received position papers from five or six small countries.

[United Press London, 18th] The four-power goodwill that emerged at the end of the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference seems to have been threatened in the meeting of foreign minister representatives today. The meeting is divided on the German peace treaty. U.S. officials said that rumors that the Soviet Union might propose the immediate withdrawal of troops from the four occupied zones of Germany are increasing its prestige among Germans, but other occupying countries are unlikely to adopt this concept. Soviet ambassador officials said that they had not heard of such a proposal. At the same time, the German-Polish border dispute is also a dangerous issue. The Soviet Union's Pravda firmly supports Poland's demand that Germany cede 40,000 square miles of land. The United States is prepared to do its best to restore all or part of the area to Germany. It seems difficult to compromise on the opposing views. Other points of contention include France's annexation of the Saar region and Yugoslavia's demand for Austria to cede 1,000 square miles.

[Agence France-Presse Vienna, 19th] Austrian Chancellor Figl will lead a political delegation to London on the 26th to present his views on the Austrian peace treaty to the four deputy foreign ministers. Foreign Minister Grleber will go to London next Tuesday with a number of experts to contribute his opinions on colonial economic and financial issues during the negotiations.

[Reuters London, 18th] The four foreign minister Austrian question representatives have written to small countries with a major interest in the Austrian treaty, inviting them to attend the meeting next week to express their views. Although the timetable has been set, it is expected that Yugoslavia, which has territorial claims on Austria, will speak on Monday, and Austria will speak on the following day. There was no formal meeting of foreign minister representatives today.

French Suggests Eight Points for Draft Austrian Peace Treaty

[Agence France-Presse London, 18th] The political clauses of the "Treaty for the Restoration of Independence of Austria" proposed by France were delivered to the Foreign Deputy Ministers' Conference this afternoon. The French delegation pointed out that the most important point in this proposal is that the Allies have an obligation to guarantee the independence of Austria. Past experience has proved that the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles were not appropriate and failed to prevent the merger of Germany and Austria. Therefore, France now specifically proposes that an exact guarantee should be added to the Treaty of Austria. The four countries of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union should jointly oppose all actions that threaten the independence of Austria and should provide all kinds of assistance to protect its political and economic independence. Conversely, Austria must not take actions that endanger its territorial integrity or political, economic, and financial independence. In particular, Germany must also recognize the independence granted to Austria by this treaty. Other suggestions are: (1) Redraw the Austrian border on March 12, 1938; (2) Abolish Germany's measures to merge Austria; (3) Cancel the nationality given to Austrians during the German rule in 1933 and 1938; (4) Prohibit Nazi Germans from obtaining Austrian nationality; (5) Guarantee the basic freedoms and other rights of the people; (6) Prohibit the organization of Nazi groups; (7) Liberate Austrian prisoners of war; (8) Within 90 days after the signing of the peace treaty, the Allied forces will withdraw from Austria and the Allied control agencies will be dissolved.

### Ramadier Continues to Negotiate New Cabinet Candidates Internally Finalized

Recent Success or Failure Depends on the Popular Republican Party

[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 19th broadcast: The leaders of the Popular Republican Party of Pidault met for two hours today and have not yet decided whether to participate in the Ramadier cabinet. Therefore, Ramadier postponed his report to President Holliet. It is heard that Pidault is unwilling to participate in the cabinet.

[United Press Paris, 18th] Ramadier has prepared a plan today to give the position of Minister of Defense to the Communist Party. This plan can make Ramadier's cabinet formation more hopeful of success. Now, it is only waiting for the Popular Republican Party, led by former Foreign Minister Pidault, to express its willingness to join the government. According to the Radical Socialist Party, Ramadier will propose that the Communist Party be appointed as Minister of Defense, but it is specially agreed that all major resolutions must be signed by the Director of the Prime Minister's Office. The three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will be assigned to the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Party, and the Radical Socialist Party to restrict them. Ramadier announced last night that if the cabinet is successfully formed, Pidault will serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The leader of the Popular Republican Party is scheduled to hold a meeting today. Before the meeting of the Popular Republican Party, Ramadier is obviously unwilling to make a final decision on his mission. According to his statement last night, there has been important progress in the cabinet formation. It was previously reported that Ramadier had hit a reef due to the Vietnam issue, and the Communist Party opposed expanding credit and increasing French military activities in Vietnam.

[Reuters Paris, 18th] Ramadier, who was commissioned to form a cabinet, said tonight that he was very optimistic about the cabinet formation and said that he had exchanged views with the leaders of various parties and that there was a general agreement that foreign policy would not change. Ramadier also said: If the cabinet is formed, Pidault will be invited to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Communist leader Thorez may not accept a position in the cabinet. The Radical Party and the Communist Party have definitely decided to participate. The Popular Republican Party may have a decision on Monday.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 19th] It is learned that the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense of the new French government have been internally finalized. The entire cabinet, including the Prime Minister, has a total of 24 members, and their distribution is as follows: seven from the Socialist Party, four from the Communist Party, four from the Popular Republican Party, four from the Radical Socialist Party and the Social Republican Union, and two from the Independent Republican Party. There are also three state councillors, each occupied by the Communist Party, the Popular Republican Party, and the Left Union. It is heard that the Left Union has formally decided to participate in the new government with 46 votes in favor, 1 vote against, and 9 abstentions. At the same time, Ramadier had a meeting with the Socialist Party members of the Congress this morning.

### German Territory, British, American, and Soviet Occupation Zones Agree on Goods Exchange Agreement

[United Press, Herford, Germany, 18th] Economic experts from the British, American, and Soviet occupation zones in Germany today signed the first of several new trade agreements at the headquarters of the Control Council, stipulating an exchange of goods worth 200 million marks for the year 1947. The conference also hopes to sign other agreements in turn, hoping that the total exchange will reach 800 million marks, comparable to the pre-war exchange volume in the region. According to this agreement, the British and American occupation zones will exchange steel, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals for wheat, construction timber, cement, glass, and other goods from the Soviet occupation zone. According to reliable sources, the steel supplied by the British and American occupation zones accounts for 15 percent of their total production.

### Pope Delivers Speech

[United Press, Vatican City, 18th] Pope Pius XII delivered a speech to the American press here today, stating: "Although the world has gone through war, the civil and religious freedoms of mankind are still not guaranteed, which is deeply regrettable. Spiritual abuse of mankind has not been eliminated, and the result of countless heroic young people sacrificing their lives is only a minimal amount of peace, justice, and benevolence. We pray daily that God will bless the leaders of all nations, and grant them the patience, courage, and strength to lead world civilization back to its former state of security in their beliefs."

### Future Anglo-Burmese Negotiations to Focus on Practical Issues

[Reuters, London, 19th] When the Anglo-Burmese conference resumes on Monday, it will discuss the practical issues of Burmese independence. The previous discussions were mostly focused on the memorandum submitted by the Burmese representatives. According to Burmese sources here, the most important of the practical issues of Burmese independence is the financial issue. Burma needs a large amount of funds to revive its post-war industry and cities, so Britain must provide loans to Burma on easy terms and with long repayment periods. It is rumored that when the Burmese chief representative Aung San was in New Delhi, Nehru promised to provide all necessary financial assistance. Although this news has not yet been confirmed, the restoration of the Congress Party is due to the large entrepreneurs of India, who are also quite interested in Burma.

Burmese Turbulent Factions in Discord

[Reuters, Rangoon, 18th] Authoritative sources here state that the clashes between bandits and military police in the Yemethin and other districts of northern Burma may be a prelude to a full-scale civil war, as the motive for the uprising is actually a struggle for power. There is also internal unrest in the Arakan region of western Burma and the Pyapon area of the Irrawaddy Delta. A senior Burmese government official stated that most of these bandits fighting against the military police and the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League volunteer corps are armed units of the Communist Party. The Burmese Red Flag Party and the Red Army Party, two communist organizations, deliberately launched a rebellion in an attempt to force the downfall of the government controlled by the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. The war in the Yemethin district is the prelude to a full-scale civil war in Burma.

### French Military Launching Major Land and Sea Offensive Aimed at Occupying Hue; French Aircraft Bomb Viet Minh Forces in University District

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 19th Broadcast: The French army in Vietnam has begun a major land and sea offensive aimed at occupying Hue.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 19th] Military News: In Hue, a battalion of French people is protecting the area, but it has been surrounded by enemy troops in a triangular area. Although the situation is serious, it is not dangerous. The triangular area is about three kilometers long and is located on the opposite bank of the Perfume River. Because the bridge has been cut off, it is in an isolated situation. The enemy is now attacking the garrison with two artillery guns from a distance of ten kilometers. It is hoped that the garrison's 5,000 troops will repel the invading enemy. The stored food can last until the middle of next month. At the same time, it can be resupplied by air. At present, French casualties are minimal.

[Reuters, Hanoi, 18th] The Viet Minh forces entrenched in the university buildings in the southwestern suburbs of Hanoi were bombed and strafed by the French Air Force today.

According to the commander of the French tank corps, the two young soldiers wanted to surrender to the French side but were beheaded by the Viet Minh forces. He also saw the body of an Annamese woman still holding a sharp blade tightly in her hand. Corpses littered the streets, and the scene was extremely tragic.

[Reuters, Hanoi, 18th] Communiqué: The French army captured many Viet Minh soldiers from the center of Hanoi. The French army has cleared the Viet Minh forces on the right bank of the Red River in southern Hanoi. Some Viet Minh soldiers committed suicide to avoid being captured.

### Rumor Has It That Viet Minh Is Considering Forming a "Compromise" Government

[United Press, Saigon, 19th] According to rumors here today, the Republic of Vietnam is currently considering forming a "compromise" new government, which may be headed by former Annamese Emperor Bảo Đại. The rumors have not been confirmed, but Annamese people apparently believe them. According to Saigon rumors, Bảo Đại will serve as the head of the new government, while the current President of the Republic of Vietnam in exile, Ho Chi Minh, will serve as the Minister of the Interior. It is reported that the Republic of Vietnam currently includes the two provinces of Nam Dinh and Tonkin, and demands that the Cochinchina region of southern Vietnam also be incorporated into the territory of the Republic. Saigon is the capital of Cochinchina province.

### New Year Outlook "Quite Good"; US Maintains Peace with Strength; US Secretary of the Army Patterson Expresses His Views

[United Press, Washington, 18th] US Secretary of the Army Patterson broadcast today that the outlook for peace in 1947 is "quite good," but the United States must have at least 1.07 million soldiers this year in order to carry out its mission. Patterson was answering questions on the weekly broadcast program "Our Foreign Policy." The question was: The bombs and missiles that have been invented indicate that collective armies are outdated. Why does the United States still need a larger army than before the war? Patterson replied: "Our country needs more than a million troops because we must be vigilant against more than a hundred million people to ensure that these people cannot disrupt peace again... An atomic bomb cannot occupy Germany and Japan. As for the so-called collective army being outdated, this has been said by many people, but it has not yet been proven. Under the United Nations organization, the mission of our country's army is to supply the American part of the force needed by the organization, and to supply the necessary and legitimate national defense in accordance with the United Nations agreement. Half of our country's army is currently engaged in overseas occupation work, and the rest is engaged in assisting the occupation forces. The main task of our military occupation is to ensure that the peace that has been won at the cost of many lives and vast property continues to exist."

### Poland Held General Election Yesterday; Strict Security Measures to Prevent Underground Forces from Sabotaging; Final Results Will Not Be Announced Until the End of This Month

[Reuters, Warsaw, 19th] Poland's 12 million voters held a general election today, with People's Self-Defense Forces armed with guns maintaining order at each polling station. The authorities have stepped up security measures to prevent sabotage by underground movement members. Foreign reporters have absolute freedom of movement and can visit various places to observe the voting situation and issue reports. Reports from various places show that although the atmosphere is extremely tense, order is still considered normal. During the election period, alcoholic beverages are prohibited from being sold. Those responsible expect that there will be no major disputes during the voting. The Democratic Bloc, composed of four parties, will obtain an overwhelming majority against the opposition Peasant Party led by Mikolajczyk. The Polish people will elect a total of 444 members of parliament. The calculation of votes adopts a complex proportional representation system, so the overall results will not be announced until the end of this month.

[United Press, Warsaw, 18th] Underground forces issued a notice today, promising to appear from their secret hiding places in the forests when the vote counting begins in the Polish election next week, and advising Peasant Party members to do their best on election day. Deputy Prime Minister and Peasant Party leader Mikolajczyk also submitted a new memorandum to the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, accusing the secret police of terrorism, saying that their party members had been detained in groups and that the election could not be called a free election without restraint. The government, on the other hand, insists that it has taken all kinds of precautions to enable the 12 million eligible voters to vote peacefully and fairly.

### World YWCA Raises Construction Fund; Marshal Expresses Full Support

[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] The World YWCA is launching a national fundraising campaign in New York to raise a construction fund of 2.1 million US dollars. The new US Secretary of State Marshall sent a letter to the YWCA before leaving China to express his support. In his letter, Marshal said, "The work of the YWCA in China has made a great contribution to helping the great women of China improve their status and opportunities. The YWCA's services have made great contributions to industrial workers, professional women, school girls, and housewives. Today, we must start working to rebuild everything that has been destroyed by Japan in the past. Therefore, raising funds is necessary and extremely appropriate. In the past, most of the Chinese YWCA was a self-help group, and it will continue to be so in the future, but it needs our help to start and promote its work again. (It is reported that the World YWCA's construction fund will train women from 30 countries (including China) within three years to lead and promote social welfare work. The fund will also be used to build association sites, assist in relief work, and fund any other emergency needs that may arise.)

### Japanese Labor Groups Brewing General Strike; Two Million People to Participate; Water and Electricity Supply in Six Major Cities in Jeopardy

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Special Dispatch] Japanese laborers have organized and seem to be preparing for what is called Japan's largest post-war strike to protest the "unpatriotic government." A joint declaration issued by the Joint Struggle Committee of Civil Servants and Public Organizations stated that 2.6 million people would participate in the general strike on November 1st. The joint declaration expressed dissatisfaction with the government's attitude towards the demands made by the alliance a few days ago, and stated that nation-building would be impossible if laborers' lives were not stabilized first. The declaration also stated that the general strike was a necessary "surgical operation" to pave the way for nation-building work. It also warned that if the government took any action to suppress the strike, alliance members represented by the Joint Struggle Committee would begin striking before February 1st. A spokesperson for the National Federation of Railway Workers' Unions stated that railway workers across the country had been ordered to take preparatory action for the general strike on February 1st in accordance with a planned overall plan. According to this overall plan, all passenger and freight trains, except for food transport vehicles, will be suspended, and automobiles, trucks, ships, and ferries connected to the railway network will also be suspended. In addition, 10,000 civil servants from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and other government agencies held a general assembly and a routine parade today.

### Seeing Allied-Occupied Japan Through the Eyes of a British Man (3)

— Original by John Morris, translated by Zhang Deqian

(3) Three Suggestions

Up to this point, I have only described the current situation in Japan. Now I must suggest some reform ideas.

I feel that our main goal cannot be achieved unless we reorganize Japan's politics and economy mainly with the Japanese themselves. For this, three conditions are necessary. First, Japanese people with different political views should be involved in this work, and they can even be forced to participate without violating the principles of Western freedom.

Second, we should seem to clearly announce the length of the occupation period, or the period of foreign management, as well as the necessary conditions for ending the management. Otherwise, Japan's best talents will continue to adopt a reclusive attitude, as they do now. This necessity can be seen from almost every aspect of the occupation work, especially when the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal hears the testimony of witnesses (this is rarely reported in our newspapers). We have selected many witnesses who know the inside story of Japan in great detail. However, none of them are willing to tell everything they know, for fear of being scolded as traitors if the occupation period is not long.

Third, we must seem to pay attention to the abilities of the Japanese and try to use them to serve us, to promote new ideas to the general Japanese public. In the current trend of thought, apart from recognizing the failure, everything is chaotic, but there is a tendency for the Japanese to think that any idea that is American is good and that Japanese is bad. This feeling must be cleared up in order to establish new ideas and new systems, while adopting the old Japanese morality (let us not forget that the Japanese were originally moral), such as loyalty, righteousness, diligence, etiquette, family system (must be appropriately modified), and love of beauty.

The above three suggestions are only general. Let us now study the actual occupation work, especially from the perspective of a British person.

British Observe MacArthur's Achievements

MacArthur's occupation policy has been severely attacked by the British (as well as the Americans), but we must use a realistic perspective to consider what we British are prepared to contribute. If there is nothing inappropriate, I should first state that, in my personal opinion (regardless of whether this opinion is valuable), MacArthur's task is almost impossible for anyone to accomplish, but he has done it so well. MacArthur's personality is a bit boastful, but no one who has talked to MacArthur can deny his sincerity and determination to thoroughly complete the tasks entrusted to him by the Allies. Anyone who says he is anti-British is talking nonsense. There is a group of important people who cannot stand criticism, so all those under them are flatterers. In Japan, such unfortunate phenomena are often seen when the Allied countries hold joint meetings. When someone raises a reasonable request and asks the headquarters to provide information, it is ultimately considered by the relevant section chief of the headquarters to be an attack on MacArthur himself. Although this type of thing is extremely understandable, it does not help Allied friendship or please the Japanese.

### Foreign Military Officer in French Army Discusses Situation in Vietnam

... Suppressing Vietnamese Independence Military Forces with 500,000 Troops...

[United Press, Saigon, 18th] A foreign military officer in the French army said today that France needs 500,000 troops to suppress the Vietnamese independence army. At the same time, a Viet Minh officer also said that the guerrillas were carrying out a sabotage war under the orders of President Ho Chi Minh, focusing on cutting railways and burning rubber factories. In the future, they will burn the rice in the French people's fields, leaving only a part for local consumption. The Viet Minh's urgent political goal is to incorporate Cochinchina into the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. France should fulfill its promise to hold a referendum in Cochinchina. It is believed that 94 percent of the people in Cochinchina support the Vietnamese Federation.

Viet Minh Army Well-Organized

The foreign military officer also said that the Viet Minh army is better organized than the French army. The guerrilla headquarters is equipped with well-equipped military maps, typewriters, and other equipment. Viet Minh troops often lack ammunition, which is supplied by German soldiers who have deserted from the French army and Vietnamese people who own weapons. The guerrillas often operate in the forests, which are so dense that the line of sight cannot pass beyond one yard, so they cannot be captured or killed.

The military officer fought with the guerrillas in the Mekong River South for several weeks, commanding a heavy weapons unit, most of whose soldiers were [illegible] German prisoners of war. It is said that French officials guaranteed that 250,000 troops would be transferred to Vietnam in July of this year, but I believe that the troops still need to be doubled.

French Army Only Occupies Important Locations

The French army only occupies important locations, and the guerrillas occupy the countryside. The French army cannot pass through the countryside except under military escort. A brigade of the foreign legion, totaling 3,500 people, lost 300 men and 700 wounded last year. In addition, a female postal worker said that the Vietnamese people are suffering politically from oppression and heavy taxes. The provisional government of Cochinchina imposes extremely heavy taxes, and tax collectors often die violently. (It is reported that the above cable was transferred by a postal worker to a neutral country's radio station and is not subject to French authorities' inspection.)

### The City Council of Shanghai and Various Legal Organizations Issue an Urgent Telegram on the Current Situation, Calling for an Immediate Ceasefire and Sincere Participation in the Reorganization of the Government, So that Democratic Constitutional Governance and Economic Construction Can Embark on a Broad and Smooth Path

The City Council of Shanghai and various legal organizations yesterday issued an urgent telegram on the current situation, stating: "To all newspaper offices nationwide, the Central News Agency and all news agencies, and forwarded to the National Political Council, provincial, city, and county councils, all social organizations, leaders of all parties, and public supervisors of social elites: We have separately sent a telegram to Mr. Chiang, Chairman of the National Government in Nanjing, and Mr. Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an, which reads: Since our country's victory, almost half a year has passed. Although reconstruction work is gradually getting on track, conflicts have not ceased. General Marshall of the Allied nations has worked tirelessly to mediate. We were celebrating that animosity would be transformed into peace and harmony, and unification would surely be achieved. Unexpectedly, negotiations have been on and off, and wars have repeatedly stopped and started, leading to a decline in national reputation and the people's livelihood suffering. It is a cause for sorrow for loved ones and joy for enemies. Reading President Truman's statement last December reiterating the United States' policy towards China, and General Marshall's statement on the eve of his departure from China, the words are earnest and sincere, causing us endless shame and gratitude. Brothers quarrel within the walls, but unite to resist external aggression. Past events are not forgotten; ancient teachings have not been abandoned. Now that the major enemy has surrendered and the global situation is unsettled, even if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have differences in political views, there should be no difference in saving the country. Moreover, the 'Program for Peaceful National Construction' has already been agreed upon, and the 'Plan for Reorganization and Unification of the Military' has been signed. In addition, the principles for revising the constitution were discussed and agreed upon long ago in the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and the constitution promulgated by the National Assembly, as Marshall said, 'mainly conforms to the principles decided by the PCC.' Therefore, although the CCP did not participate in the National Assembly, the door to peace talks has never been closed. Recently, we heard that the government is sincerely restoring peace talks. Although the proposal to send high-ranking officials to Yan'an was blocked by the CCP's rejection, other ways to promote peace are still being tried step by step. Unfortunately, the CCP still insists on its two conditions of restoring the military positions before January 13th last year and abolishing the newly promulgated constitution, and has not found an opportunity for reconciliation. To this end, we would like to respectfully inform Your Excellency (Sir/Madam): Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the people of our country have been in dire straits for ten years. After extreme chaos, people yearn for order; after extreme stripping, restoration is imminent.

Heaven-Sent Opportunities Must Not Be Lost

Domestically, the people are haggard and urgently need recovery. If the war prolongs, the economy will collapse. Internationally, after the war, everyone hopes for peace. If there is still war in our country, it may lead to the Allied nations' contempt, and the power of our voice will be reduced during the discussion of the peace treaty with the enemy. In short, the hungry easily crave food, and the thirsty easily crave drink. We only hope for peaceful unification and living and working in peace. Internally, it can restore social vitality; externally, it can maintain international status. What else can we ask for? Therefore, whoever can stop the war is the savior of the people; whoever destroys it is the criminal of the country. Now the constitution has been solemnly promulgated throughout the country, and the people across the country are trying their best to abide by it. How can we allow a few people to make reckless remarks? Even if the CCP has different opinions, it can participate in the election of the next National Assembly representatives and seek its correction through legal procedures. How can it use destroying the constitution as a condition for peace talks? As for restoring the military positions before January 13th last year, it is even more not allowed by reason and principle.

The Republic of China is a country owned, governed, and shared by all the people. It cannot be privately owned by a party, monopolized by a class, or seized by illegal force. Any place in the country is the territory of the state, and any troops in the country should be under the command of the government. Since both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have agreed to return the military to the state, why should there be a dispute over military positions? It must be known that any sweet-sounding term cannot shake our common belief that the country must be unified; any dazzling theory cannot cover up our common goal that the country must be built peacefully. Chairman Chiang is a leader loved by the people, and the National Government is a legitimate government recognized by China and foreign countries. We can only firmly demand that the government troops and the CCP troops immediately cease fire unconditionally in their respective locations. No party shall privately own its troops anymore. At the same time,

peace talks should be reopened and the government reorganized as soon as possible. All parties and factions should participate sincerely and jointly manage the country, so that democratic constitutional governance and economic construction can embark on a broad and smooth path. Those who still do not want to give up the attempt to divide and occupy by force and refuse to participate in the reorganized government are no different from isolating themselves from the people of the country. We also hope that the Military Mediation Department should not only not be abolished but also strengthen its organization and fulfill its mission. When necessary, all legal organizations in the country should jointly elect representatives to participate in it, impartially and strictly supervising the ceasefire on the spot, to fulfill the duty of the master of the country. In short, returning the military to the state and returning the government to the people are necessary steps for our country to achieve peaceful unification and implement democratic constitutional governance today. People share the same idea, and hearts share the same reason. The National Government and the Chinese Communist Party have always said that they respect public opinion. Now is the only opportunity to test

whether they respect public opinion. The people's likes and dislikes are already obvious. If the measures lose the people's hearts, the consequences will be immediately visible. What the heart feels is dangerous, and in a hurry, one cannot choose words. We hope that Your Excellency (Sir/Madam) will take this into consideration and implement it. The overall situation of the country is at a critical juncture. Whether there is peace or danger, order or chaos, prosperity or decline, strength or weakness, all depends on the people's views on national affairs today and their determination to implement these views. Now that the constitution has been promulgated and will be implemented on December 25th this year, all preparatory procedures must be rushed to catch up, fearing that it will be too late. How can we allow the Communist Party to cause further disputes and the government to waste time? We respectfully present our humble opinions for your consideration. If you agree, please send separate telegrams to both sides to urge them, so that peaceful unification can be achieved in the shortest possible time. The country will be fortunate! The nation will be fortunate! Shanghai City Council, Shanghai Local Association, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial Association, Shanghai General Labor Union, Shanghai Farmers' Association, Shanghai Educational Association, Shanghai Journalists' Association, Shanghai Bankers' Association, Shanghai Lawyers' Association, Shanghai Accountants' Association, Shanghai Physicians' Association, Shanghai Women's Association, Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association, Fourth District Flour Industry Association, Shanghai Branch of the Chinese National Foreign Affairs Association, respectfully."

### Sea Otters and Tigers Vie for Splendor, Black Foxes and Yellow Wolves Reduced in Price; The Skins of Traitors - Inspect Samples and Wait for Bids

[Reported by this newspaper] The Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office of the Central Trust of China is holding its first auction of "traitor skins." The samples went on display yesterday on the eighth floor of the Bank of China on the Bund. Approximately 200 people attended to view the samples. Viewing will continue today from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Due to the upcoming Lunar New Year, the bidding deadline has been extended to 5:00 PM on the 27th, and the opening of bids will be held publicly at 9:00 AM on January 28th.

The entire collection of 229 fur items is divided into 25 groups and originally belonged to the five traitors Qian Dagui, Li Yeqing, Zhou Fohai, Wu She Aizhen, and Sheng Youji. The highest starting price is for Li Yeqing's sea otter skin coat, reaching 9 million yuan, while the lowest starting price is for a piece of fur collar, only 1,500 yuan.

There are many whole fur items, including sea otters, tigers, foxes, otters, black foxes, gray squirrels, and yellow wolves. Sea otters are animals produced in the Bering Strait area, with particularly thick fur, most suitable for making coat collars, and more expensive than otters. Qian Dagui has two of them, both with a starting price of 2.25 million yuan. Li Yeqing has the most otters, reaching 17, while Zhou Fohai has mostly black foxes, totaling 15. The tiger skin belongs to Sheng Youji, with a starting price of only 180,000 yuan.

Most of those who came to view the samples yesterday were businessmen, because the auction is divided into groups, and ordinary people cannot use that much. Most of the ladies who came to view the samples were most interested in Qian Dagui's black fox female cloak with hand muffs, with a starting price of only 375,000 yuan, but the starting price of the entire group is 4.35 million yuan.

### Urgent Drums, the Gates of the Netherworld Arrive; Some Families Rejoice, Some Families Worry; Listening to the Lunar New Year Drums with Fear and Trembling; Gritting Teeth and Exerting Strength to Adjust Funds; A Thousand Gold for an Orange, Ten Thousand Yuan for a Haircut; The Price of a Human Life is Particularly Cheap, Only Worth 500,000; As the Year Ends, the Scene is Bleak

The New Year drums are beating, their sound is fragmented and scattered, and their sound is heard with fear and trembling!

In a rapidly changing and declining year, "players" mostly lose "confidence," so the impact is that there are only a few cats and dogs in the dance halls, and the scene is bleak and indescribable. Several coffee shops on Tibet Road are almost in a state of "hibernation."

Shantou honey oranges are popular because the pronunciation of "orange" sounds like "auspicious," so they have become the "king of fruit plates." In ancient times, there was a saying of "a thousand gold for a smile," but now there is only the event of "a thousand gold for an orange"!

Eggs, as an object, occupy an "important" position in the "New Year's Eve dinner." "Businessmen" like to seek good luck, so eggs are beautifully called "yuanbao eggs." However, also because the value of eggs is comparable to gold yuanbao, the current price has risen from 250 yuan to 500 yuan. This is also a case of "the times create heroes."

Barbershops, which specialize in doing work on the head, have already hung up a red paper agreed upon by the industry, printed with eight black characters: "New Year's usual rules, double the fee." Therefore, many customers, when they finally hear the staff asking for 8,000 to 10,000 yuan, change from "radiant" to "gloomy."

In the United Commercial Market, in order to cope with the need for funds near the end of the year, inventories are released and sold in large quantities. Among them, American military canned food is the most numerous, and they are piled up everywhere, resembling undulating hills, giving people the feeling of revisiting Guilin. It is truly worthy of the name "cheap" and "beautiful," but the only flaw is that most of these items are products from the European War in 1942. Therefore, there is no way to name them, so they can be called: authentic "old goods"!

In front of the foreign cemetery on Hankou Road, a "flower market" has formed in recent days. Winter plums and heavenly bamboo stretch out in the wind, with a great sense of color and fragrance. However, a small branch like a pen costs 5,000 or 10,000 yuan. Although it is said that winter plums and heavenly bamboo can be used for pure offerings, they ultimately do not understand romance and cannot solve the problem of warmth and fullness. Therefore, there are many people who look at them and leave!

Zhang Shiyan, director of the Criminal Division of the Police Department, said: "If a robber can have an income of 500,000 yuan in advance, he can survive the end of the year and will definitely not be willing to risk his life to break the law." The price of a life is only worth 500,000 yuan, which is sad to say!

As the end of the year approaches, friends who "cannot make it through" are running out of options. Yesterday, statistics showed that as many as four people committed suicide because they could not repay their debts. It is truly what is said: "Urgent drums, the gates of the netherworld arrive; some families rejoice, some families worry."

Those who knock New Year's Eve gongs and drums late at night are extremely annoying. Their sound is monotonous and harsh, and they are mixed with male tenor singing to celebrate, like howling, or like Taoist priests chanting scriptures. It is proposed to name it "the worst music in the world." Moreover, their knocking does not require anyone's consent. When they ask for a reward after "a song is over," if they encounter someone who does not give generously, they will verbally abuse people, which makes people laugh and cry.

According to those who run "municipal government news," the directors of various bureaus have been busy adjusting "funds" on the phone in recent days, all showing an awkward expression, because the cries of "subordinates" are endless. As a superior, at this critical juncture, he has to grit his teeth and exert his strength to win people's hearts.

During festivals, entertainment venues are doubly lively. Several large cinemas have already started pre-ordering tickets for the first day of the Lunar New Year. Scalpers are also taking the opportunity to be active, but they have changed their style. "Big scalpers" are responsible for "rolling tickets," and "small scalpers" are engaged in "disposing of them." However, they are careful but not small, and the asking price is like a "lion's big mouth." The original price of 3,500 yuan is actually asked for 5,500 yuan. It is true that "wild grass cannot be burned out, the spring breeze blows again."

The police department has expressly prohibited the setting off of firecrackers, but those who prohibit prohibit themselves, and those who set off set them off. The sound of crackling has been endless before the New Year has even arrived. Those who suffer from heart disease and neurasthenia must be extra careful when going out.

In times of hardship and poverty, most people feel more sorrow and distress about the New Year than joy. Yesterday, a poor ticket seller on a trolleybus on a certain road babbled. He said: "It's better to let Shanghai drop an atomic bomb, no matter if you are poor or rich, everyone will die together, that would be happy!" Hearing it is frightening!

Amidst the New Year's sales, various stores are eager to sell goods and get cash. Their methods of attracting customers are ingenious and different. The most clever is to raise the listed price and use discounts as a slogan. Its ability to attract attention is beyond doubt. The boss does not "lose blood," and the customers can get a Q-style comfort. It can be said that they have deeply understood the art of marketing.

The group with the highest starting price among all groups is the tenth group, totaling 12,855,000 yuan, including 15 pieces of various fur items. The group with the lowest starting price is the nineteenth group, only 480,000 yuan, including three pieces of large and small fur items.

What aroused the most interest among the viewers was Sheng Youji's collection of a white fur dragon robe, with exquisite patterns on the robe surface, and a yellow-faced sable from Li Yeqing.

Visitors to the auction of traitor fur items are endless. The tiger skin in the picture belongs to Sheng Youji (photo by this newspaper).

### Overseas Chinese from Shanghai Returning to the Philippines, U.S. Consulate Handles Visas

According to news from the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office: (1) Regarding the issue of Filipino overseas Chinese from our country handling procedures for returning to their place of residence, the Philippine government did not agree to the suggestion of entrusting the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to handle it on their behalf. However, it may send a consul to Xiamen within the month to handle it. In Shanghai, matters concerning visas to the Philippines are now handled by the U.S. Consulate. (2) The Dutch East Indies authorities have allowed 85 of our country's mechanics to enter the country. (3) The Vietnamese authorities have allowed overseas Chinese who returned to China after 1937 and engaged in wartime service to return to Vietnam. Regarding the repatriation of returning overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office is consulting with the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). It is hoped that in the future, they can be directly repatriated from Shanghai.

### Philippine Wartime Currency, Must Be Exchanged Before the End of January

It is reported that the Philippine government has issued an order requiring that paper currency issued before and during the war be exchanged for victory currency with the government before the end of January this year. It will not be valid after the deadline. Any Philippine currency that does not have the word "Victory" stamped on it should be sent to the Philippines within this month for relatives and friends to exchange. Overseas Chinese in the Philippines at home should pay attention to this.

### Zhijiang Wheel Passengers, Number of Dead and Injured Unknown, Relevant Authorities Consult on Aftermath, Tongji Company Temporarily Suspends Business, Passenger Negotiations Unsuccessful, Navigation Administration Bureau Submits Detailed Report to the Ministry

[Reported by this newspaper] There were still no concrete decisions on the aftermath of the sinking of the Zhijiang Wheel yesterday. The Tongji Company posted a notice at its office at 334 Cishudasha in the morning, stating: "Our company has suffered heavy losses and will temporarily suspend business for one week to handle the aftermath of the Zhijiang Wheel." At that time, dozens of rescued passengers gathered in the corridor of the office, and their emotions were quite indignant. Some of these dozens of passengers demanded refunds, some demanded compensation for lost luggage, and some inquired about missing companions, but they were unable to find anyone to negotiate with. They gradually left in disappointment until noon.

In the afternoon, Li Qianyu, manager of Tongji Company, had been released on bail from the Water Police Station and returned. At the same time, the company had reported the sinking of the Zhijiang Wheel to the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau and the Shipowners Association for filing. In addition, it hired lawyer Dai Mingchao to publish a notice in the newspaper, requiring passengers who suffered losses to go to the office with their tickets for registration within seven days. At the same time, it will negotiate with Huatong Wheel of the Public Welfare Industrial Company and its towed iron barges No. 305 and No. 45 in accordance with the Maritime Law.

As for the exact number of deaths and injuries of passengers, it was still impossible to determine as of yesterday, because all passenger tickets sold did not indicate the names and occupations, and Huanqiu Transportation Company has not yet notified the company authorities of the number of passenger tickets sold. It is also known that the number of "yellowfish" (smuggled goods) carried on the Zhijiang Wheel was also considerable, so it is not easy to obtain accurate figures in the short term.

According to Li Gufan, director of the Navigation Administration Bureau, the matter of the Zhijiang Wheel sinking in Wusongkou after colliding with the Huatong Wheel of the Public Welfare Company has been reported to the Ministry of Communications based on the investigation report, and the collision process has been sent to the Port Affairs Committee, the Jianghai Customs, the Water Police Station, the Shipowners Association, and other relevant agencies for joint consultation on the aftermath, and a collision compensation committee will be organized to handle it. As for the compensation for the deaths and injuries of passengers and luggage, it must be handled according to the tickets, but "yellowfish" passengers who are privately brought by the crew naturally have no formal tickets, so the company cannot be ordered to compensate. However, this kind of illegal private smuggling of "yellowfish" should also be subject to appropriate punishment.

In addition, the Tongji Company has scheduled a reception for the Shanghai press today to report the details of the accident. At the same time, the missing crew members Xie Yutian, Ma Aniu, and Hu Deyuan, who are in charge of the ship's store, the kitchen workers, were investigated again by the company's deputy manager Wu Guoqing at the scene of the accident in Wusongkou yesterday, but their whereabouts are still unknown.

### Pardoned Juvenile Offenders to Receive Moral Education

According to an investigation by the Shanghai Local Court, among the criminals who meet the pardon regulations, there are still more than 30 homeless juvenile offenders, all of whom should be given moral education so that they can reform and start anew. The court has specially consulted with the Christian Children's Aid Society and the Juvenile Village to provide them with relief. It has been approved for them to be taken in and given moral education. The batch of juvenile offenders is currently being handed over by the detention center of the Local Court.

### Chief Judge Liu Presides in Person, Thirty-Five Criminals Pardoned Yesterday

The Shanghai High Court, considering that the Spring Festival is approaching, released those criminals who were eligible for pardon. Yesterday was a regular holiday, but the Criminal Court still worked as usual to process pardon cases. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Chief Judge Liu Yugui personally went to the Masinan Road Detention Center to take custody of 35 criminals eligible for pardon, immediately restoring their freedom and giving them earnest instructions, asking each criminal to repent and start anew, and not to betray the state's pardon. The released criminals were full of smiles and happily left prison.

Many of the criminals pardoned by the High Court covered their faces with their hands when they were released, avoiding being photographed because they knew they were ashamed (photo by China News Agency).

### Travel Agency Telephone Operators' Bonus Unresolved

Petition to the City Party Headquarters This Morning

After the travel agency's entire telephone operators requested the management to issue a year-end bonus of two months, the management refused. The union then filed a request with the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, but the management did not participate in the negotiations. According to the person in charge of the union's travel agency group, the year-end bonus for telephone operators in various travel agencies has been issued every year from one to three months according to past practice. Unexpectedly, the management refused to issue it this year, saying that business was sluggish. He continued that telephone operators in travel agencies are slightly different from other employees, because travel agency telephones themselves have income. At present, ordinary passengers are charged 600 yuan for using the phone once, while the cost is only 50 to 150 yuan. Travel agencies in this city with better business have a monthly telephone bill income of about 10 million yuan, so the reason for refusing to issue the bonus cannot be that business is sluggish. Finally, he said that the management has repeatedly delayed resolving the issue, and they will still follow legal procedures and send representatives Wang Jiaqi and others, led by Union Chairman Li, to the City Party Headquarters at 9:00 AM this morning to petition.

### Wenhui Daily Labor-Management Dispute, Labor Side Discusses Negotiation Process

Wenhui Daily was suspended due to a labor-management dispute. According to the labor side, the management initially took the Dagong Daily as an example for the year-end bonus, first issuing one month's salary, and if the Dagong Daily exceeded one month, it would be supplemented. Later, it was heard that the Dagong Daily's bonus was one month's salary and one month's loan, so the workers proposed to the management to borrow one month's salary to fulfill their promise, but it was rejected by the management. Later, they asked for any amount, but it was not allowed, which led to a breakdown between the two sides.

### City Council Site Resolved, U.S. Military to Relocate Next Month

The issue of the new site for the Shanghai City Council was resolved at the first session of the first congress, requesting the former Enemy Property Handling Bureau to allocate the U.S. military barracks on Peng Road in the Hongkou District of Pudong (　　　　Autonomy　Place). The U.S. troops stationed there were originally scheduled to relocate at the end of November last year, but later requested to renew the lease for three months, which will expire next month. It is now learned that the U.S. military has sent a letter to the City Council yesterday, stating that the site will be handed over as scheduled in mid-February.

It is also learned that the Civil Affairs Department is currently using the police bureau's buildings, which are insufficient for office work. It has now been decided that after the new site for the City Council is resolved, it will prepare to move into it.

### Glorious Return of the Lone Army from Australia, Future Livelihood Still a Problem

The 50 soldiers of the Four-Row Lone Army who were captured by the enemy and sent to New Britain Island for hard labor, except for more than 10 who died, the remaining 34 have returned gloriously from Australia last week. It is now learned that after the return of the Lone Army, led by platoon leader Zhu Yu, they paid respects to the wife of General Xie Jinyuan and went to Wuxi the other day to ask the Lone Army regimental commander Shangguan Zhibiao for instructions. According to platoon leader Zhu, when the Lone Army was detained in the Lone Army Camp on Singapore Road in Shanghai, they were assisted in many ways by leaders of the city's party and groups and social celebrities such as Mr. Du Yuesheng, and they expressed their gratitude. This time, they have returned to the country, and their future livelihood is worrying, so they intend to appeal to all sectors to continue to provide assistance, so that the brothers will not suffer from hunger and cold.

### Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Group, Organizing Internally and Awaiting Termination Orders

The Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan was established in Shanghai in February last year. It developed domestic transportation and carefully formulated repair and new construction plans, which were handed over to the competent transportation authorities for implementation. Now that the work is coming to an end, it has begun to organize internally and await termination orders. All the foreign consultants, more than a dozen, have also been successively dismissed and returned to their countries. According to Liang Bogao, the chief secretary of the group, the group's work is divided into three parts: railways, highways, and ports: (1) On the railway side, the repair plan for the original railways south of the Great Wall has been completed, and a plan to add a north-south trunk line from Lanzhou to Guangzhou Bay and a new road plan connecting Chongqing and Changsha have been drafted. The Lanzhou-Baotou line is also under consideration. (2) For highways, the national highway network has been completed and highway standards have been formulated. (3) For ports, a plan for opening new ports and repairing old ports south of Dalian and west of Guangzhou Bay has been completed.

In the south, it is planned to develop Guangzhou Bay. At the same time, the future of Xiamen Port is also very promising. After the port is expanded in the future, it is also planned to build a railway to Jiangxi. In addition, it is planned to submit the Shanghai Grand Port repair plan to the Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee for reference.

### Woman Attempts Suicide by Jumping into River, Then Hanging Herself; Silent Young Woman's Determination to Die

[Report from our Newspaper] The day before yesterday, around 1 p.m., in the Jiangqiao Town area of western Shanghai, a young woman, wearing a gray old cotton robe, with yellow underwear underneath, bare feet in tattered cotton shoes, and a shaved head, was about to take off her clothes and attempt to drown herself in the river.

### Shanghai Press in the Last Century

— Special Article by Our Newspaper

Undoubtedly, Shanghai's press circles hold a leading position in the development of China's modern journalism. The reason for this is not difficult to explain. From a horizontal perspective, Shanghai is located at the gateway to the Yangtze River basin, which has the densest population, and has become the central metropolis of the country, not only excelling in industry and commerce but also being a cultural source, with abundant talents and resources. Under this environment, the newspapers most needed by society naturally emerged. From a vertical perspective, Shanghai was opened as a commercial port a century ago, gaining a head start in all aspects, thus giving rise to the earliest newspapers in the country.

Here, by tracing the general situation of Shanghai's press circles in the last century, we can learn how the city's journalists have been striving and making progress, and gain a rough outline of the progress of Shanghai's – even China's – journalism.

The First Chinese Newspaper

The emergence of modern newspapers in our country originated with foreigners. Early newspapers in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Xinbao, Shenbao, Hubao, and Xinwenbao, were all operated by foreigners at first. The earliest newspaper in Shanghai, before the Shenbao, was the "Shanghai Xinbao," which was published in the first month of the first year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (1862). It was the Chinese version of the North-China Daily News, printed on both sides of foreign paper, with a size equivalent to one-fourth of an ordinary newspaper. It was published every two days, with no publication on Sundays. It was published for twelve years, and the chief editor was always a Western missionary. The first was M. F. Wood, the second was J. Fryer, and the third was Y. J. Allen. The news content was mostly selected from the North-China Daily News, with the remainder transcribed from the Beijing Gazette and Hong Kong newspapers. From 1868, the layout was reformed, and the content was enriched. Each issue was a large sheet of paper, 18 inches high and 24 inches wide, folded in half and printed on both sides. It also published machine illustrations to broaden knowledge. From 1870, short headlines were added to each news item, such as "The Death of Admiral Liu," printed in the largest font.

For the ten years that the Shanghai Xinbao was published, it monopolized the top position among Chinese newspapers in Shanghai. It was not until the publication of the Shenbao in the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872) that it met a strong rival. At that time, the Shanghai Xinbao cost 30 cash per issue, while the Shenbao cost only 8 cash. Moreover, the Shenbao published poems and essays, making it more popular with the general public. Under such circumstances, the Shanghai Xinbao had to rise up and compete. From July 2, 1872, it was changed to daily publication, and the price was reduced to 8 cash per issue. Bamboo branch lyrics and other items were also published from August 17. The masthead was decorated with scenery of the Huangpu River, and the name of the newspaper was written in artistic characters. Various reforms were made with great effort. In order to compete, it gritted its teeth and was willing to operate at a loss. Later, Meizha, the former owner of the Shenbao, persuaded the management, saying, "We are both British merchants, why bother to fight each other?" By this time, the Shanghai Xinbao was exhausted and decided to announce its retirement. Thus, on December 31, 1872, this first morning star fell.

Shenbao

The Shenbao was founded on the 23rd day of the third month of the eleventh year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (April 30, 1872, Gregorian calendar). The founder was Ernest Major, a Briton, but the opinions were purely overseen by Chinese personnel. The chief editor was Jiang Zhixiang. When it was first published, the newspaper was issued every two days, one sheet per issue, printed on one side of Chinese Mao Tai paper, divided into eight chapters (i.e., eight pages). In addition to advertisements, editorials, and local and foreign news, its content also reprinted the Beijing Gazette, palace gate transcripts, price lists of various goods, and ship import and export dates. From the fifth issue, it was changed to daily publication, but it still did not publish on Sundays.

From the first day of the eighth month of the thirteenth year of Tongzhi (September 1, 1874), it was changed to printing on Sai Jing paper, and the size was increased. From the seventh day of the third month of the fifth year of Guangxu (April 27, 1879), it did not suspend publication even on Sundays. In the seventh year of Guangxu, when the Tianjin-Shanghai telegraph lines were first connected, a reporter in Tianjin was instructed to use telegraph to transmit the Qing court's decrees. The first national telegram was published on the 27th day of the eleventh month of the same year. In the tenth year of Guangxu, when France invaded Annam, a reporter was sent to infiltrate the French camp to collect military information. This was the first time a Chinese newspaper had a military correspondent.

In the thirty-second year of Guangxu, Meizha sold all the shares, and the Shenbao became a Chinese-run enterprise. After that, the newspaper began to be printed on both sides. Later, a new building was constructed at the intersection of Hankou Road and Wangping Street. American printing presses were added internally, the content of the newspaper was reformed, and "Weekly Supplements," "Changzhi Supplements," "Automobile Supplements," and "Book Weekly" were created.

The Shenbao had many affiliated businesses. Half a year after its founding (the tenth month of the eleventh year of Tongzhi), it published the monthly "Yinyuan Suoji," which was later renamed "Siming Suoji" and "Shiyu Suoji." In the second year of Guangxu, it also created "Minbao," a simple-to-understand publication for the general public. In the eighth month of the third year of Guangxu, it created "Yinyi Huabao." In the tenth year of Guangxu, it also published "Dianshi Zhai Huabao," and at the same time, it used lead-type to print pocket-sized books, numbering over one hundred and twenty titles. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, on its 50th anniversary, it published "The Most Recent Fifty Years." In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, on its 60th anniversary, it successively compiled and published Shenbao Monthly, Shenbao Yearbook, Shenbao Books, and Chinese Provincial Maps, and established the Shenbao Circulation Library, Shenbao Journalism Correspondence School, Shenbao Amateur Practice School, and Reader Service Department. From the twenty-fifth year, it was changed to a monthly and weekly publication.

Huibao

The Huibao was published on the third day of the fifth month of the thirteenth year of Tongzhi. The initiator was Rong Hong (Chunfu), the first Chinese student to study abroad. Most of the investors were Cantonese. At that time, it engaged in a war of words with the Shenbao. On the 21st day of the seventh month, it was renamed "Huibao." In the first year of Guangxu, it was renamed "Yibao," and it ceased publication on the seventh day of the eleventh month of that year.

Xinbao

On the eighth day of the tenth month of the second year of Guangxu, Shanghai also published a "Xinbao," which was nominally published by various provincial merchant guilds, but the funds actually came from the treasury. The news was listed in both Chinese and English, but Westerners did not read this newspaper, so the English version was canceled in the fifth month of that year, and the name of the newspaper was changed to vertical writing. On the 29th day of the fifth month of the eighth year, due to poor sales, it was merged into the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau.

Hubao

The Hubao was also a product of the North-China Daily News, founded on the second day of the fourth month of the eighth year of Guangxu (1883). Initially, Balfour, the chief editor of the newspaper, saw that the company had a collection of Chinese lead type and thought it a pity to leave it unused. He then invited Dai Qingsheng, Cai Er Kang, and others to be chief editors and reinvigorated the publication of the Hubao. At that time, there was a superstition in the newspaper industry that newspapers with names written vertically were short-lived, taking the Huibao and Yibao as examples. Therefore, the Hubao was later renamed "Zilin Hubao" and written horizontally, but the nutrition still did not improve. It was then sold to the Japanese and renamed "Dohbun Hubao."

Xinwenbao

The history of the Xinwenbao is also very early. It was founded on New Year's Day of the nineteenth year of Guangxu (1893). Initially, it was a joint venture between Chinese and foreign merchants. The general manager was an Englishman, Dan Foshi, and Cai Er Kang was invited to be the chief editor. Later, due to financial constraints, John C. Ferguson, an American, invested in its purchase. After that, it was run by Chinese.

Shiwu Ribao

The Shiwu Ribao was founded in Shanghai on the 21st day of the third month of the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu, recording major events at home and abroad and commenting on the merits and demerits of current affairs, which was refreshing. In the seventh month of that year, it was renamed "Zhongwai Ribao." In the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, due to insufficient finances, it was subsidized by Cai Naihuang of Shanghai. 　　, the number of copies sold was greatly 　　, and it ceased publication.

Shibao

On the 29th day of the fourth month of the thirtieth year of Guangxu, the Shibao was published. Its unique features were: first, it published short comments every day for a week, which were concise and to the point, and were a unique style at the time; second, it published some short stories and essays, which could easily arouse young people's literary 　　. In addition, matters 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 　　 , the use of large and small characters, etc., were shocking reforms in the newspaper world at that time.

It ceased publication after the August 13th Anti-Japanese War due to unbearable enemy pressure.

### Birthplace of Newspapers - Wangping Street

As the morning light dawned, the special morning market of Wangping Street began to stir.

Here, from the Shenbao Building on Hankou Road to the Xinwenbao Building on Hankou Road, and the vicinity of Shandong Road and Fuzhou Road, in a cross-shaped area—you can see many large and small newspaper vendors distributing newspapers. Under the eaves of the market buildings, on the cement pavements of the sidewalks, have become their temporary offices, crowded and noisy.

No one living in Shanghai doesn't know Wangping Street. The so-called Wangping Street refers to the section of Shandong Road between Nanjing Road and Fuzhou Road. Passing Fuzhou Road, it is called Maijiayuan—but now it has long been collectively called "Shandong Middle Road." However, the three words "Wangping Street" are still being used, because Wangping Street has had a very close relationship with the Shanghai news industry. And, don't you remember? It was once called "Newspaper Street."

The reason why Wangping Street is called Newspaper Street has a long history! Shenbao, Xinwenbao, Shibao, Shishi Xinbao, Minguo Ribao, Chenbao, etc. were all on Wangping Street. Zhongwai Ribao, Shenzhou Ribao, Taipingyang Bao, Minsheng Bao, Minbao, Minxu Bao, Xin Shenbao, Zhonghua Xinbao, Shangbao, etc. in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China were also on Wangping Street. It was lively from the late Qing Dynasty until the fourteenth or fifteenth year of the Republic of China. Some newspapers closed, and some moved. But now many newspapers are still near this crossroads, and the newspaper vendors are even more attached to their old place. Every morning, they distribute newspapers from the newspaper buildings and are still sorting them out on Wangping Street, maintaining the characteristics of Wangping Street.

From the Late Qing Dynasty to the Present

Extremely Lively Every Morning

### A Casual Discussion on Supplements

It is "an absolute given" that newspapers have supplements nowadays. However, early Shanghai newspapers only published advertisements and news. Not to mention supplements, there wasn't even a trace of literary writing. It wasn't until the founding of Shenbao, in order to compete with the Shanghai Xinbao at the time and considering the scarcity of topics, that it openly solicited articles in the publication regulations: "If any poets and literati are willing to contribute short poems and long articles, such as bamboo branch lyrics and long narrative poems from famous areas around the world, they will not be valued."

The last sentence in this solicitation, "they will not be valued," is very interesting. It turns out that at the time, it was already a great favor if the newspaper didn't charge for advertising submissions. As for payment, it was still "unknown." At the time, famous scholars in Shanghai competed to submit their poems and essays, taking pride in having their names published. The content was all about wind, clouds, moon, and dew, with countless poems. Shenbao even specially published the monthly "Yinyuan Suoji" to cope with these "masterpieces" because they couldn't publish them all in the newspaper.

However, at this time, there was only the content of supplements, not the form of supplements. The text was mostly inserted between or after news items. The formal supplement was when the Dohbun Hubao (formerly Zilin Hubao) created the supplement "Dohbun Xiaoxianlu" on the same day it was founded in 1900, which was included with the newspaper. Once this method was adopted, newspapers followed suit one after another. On August 24, 1911, Shenbao created Ziyoutan. Later, Xinwenbao also created "Zhuangxie Yelu," which was renamed Kuaihuolin on August 16, 1914, and renamed Xinyuanlin after January 28.

The effectiveness of supplements is sometimes greater than that of a commentary or news item. During the Guangxu period, when Guomin Riri Bao was published in Shanghai, its supplement "Hei'an Shijie," edited by Lian Heng (Mutai), attacked Qing officials relentlessly. Yu Youren founded Minzhu Bao and extended the invitation to Tan Shanwu to serve as chief editor of the supplement. However, although there was a special page, it did not have a separate name. When Shibao was published in the thirtieth year of Guangxu, it paid special attention to supplements.

Now, supplements have been universally valued, and people no longer treat them as the "newspaper's backside." Several newspapers win purely with supplements. Every day, the number of supplements regularly published is more than one. There are also supplements published weekly or every two or three days. The content of the latter is often more specialized, such as "Publishing World," "Women's Friend," and "Chinese Rural Areas." The former are mostly comprehensive or literary, such as "Ziyoutan," "Da Gongyuan," "Citie," "Heibai," "Xinyuanlin," and "Bihui," "Wenzong," and "Chunqiu."

### Advocating Nationalism, Promoting Anti-Manchuism, Several Revolutionary Newspapers in History, Their Newspaper Buildings Were Often Sealed, and Hosts Were Often Arrested, But They Rallied and Persisted Unflinchingly, Eventually Achieving Great Merit

In the late Qing Dynasty, internal affairs were not in order, and foreign troubles arose one after another. Domestic intellectuals rose up to take revolutionary salvation of the country as their own responsibility. At that time, members of the People's Party in the Shanghai Concession published newspapers one after another, advocating nationalism, promoting anti-Manchuism, and sparing no effort. Famous ones included Subao, Guomin Riri Bao, Jingjing Ribao, Minxu Bao, Minli Bao, etc. Although they were repeatedly oppressed, they rose up and persisted unflinchingly, ultimately establishing immortal achievements in the history of the founding of the Republic of China.

Advocating Revolution, Subao Was Sealed

Subao was founded in the summer of the twenty-third year of Guangxu and was run by Hu Zhang (Tiemei). It was later purchased by Chen Fan (Mengpo), who extended the invitation to Wu Jingheng (Zhihui) and others to be chief editors. At that time, there was a so-called Guangfu Hui in Shanghai. Strong members of the association, such as Zhang Taiyan, Cai Yuanpei, Xu Xilin, and Qiu Jin, used Subao to advocate revolution. In the fifth month of the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, Zou Rong of Sichuan organized the Patriotic Society and published the book "Revolutionary Army." The newspaper promoted the book, which angered the Qing court. An order was issued to close the Subao building and arrest Zhang Taiyan, Zou Rong, and others. After four trials, the Qing court sentenced them to life imprisonment. However, due to the fierce popular sentiment and the dissenting opinions of the consular corps in the concession, a deadlock was reached. It was not until the third month of the following year that the sentence was changed to Zou Rong imprisoned for two years, Zhang Taiyan imprisoned for three years, sentenced to hard labor, released upon completion, and deported. The sensational Subao case came to an end.

Changing Names, Continuing to Strive

After Subao was sealed in the fifth month of the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, Guomin Riri Bao was founded in the sixth month of the same year. A. Somoll, a foreigner, came forward, but in reality, it was still run by people from Subao. Its supplement "Hei'an Shijie" and the "Nandu Luyan Yi" it contained attacked bureaucrats and awakened the national race concept of the Chinese people, following the style of Subao. The Qing court, learning from the difficulties in the Subao case, issued an order to the Yangtze River area, strictly prohibiting the sale and reading of the newspaper. However, at that time, the postal service was just emerging, and most newspapers were delivered by letter offices. Prevention was impossible, and efforts were in vain.

With the same goals as Subao and Guomin Riri Bao, Cai Yuanpei and others also organized Jingzhong Ribao. The German consul of the Qing Dynasty sent a letter to the Mixed Court, issuing a warrant to arrest the chief editor. As a result, employees of the newspaper were imprisoned, and the machinery that printed the newspaper was confiscated. (This was in the third month of the thirty-first year of Guangxu.)

### Erecting Three Principles of the People, Horizontal Three Principles of the People

The three newspapers known as "Erecting Three Principles of the People," Minhu, Minxu, and Minzhu, were all founded by Yu Youren. Initially, Yu used writing to oppose the Manchus and was not tolerated by the Qing officials. He fled from Shaanxi to Shanghai, organized Shenzhou Ribao, and then published Minhu Bao (founded in the spring of the first year of Xuantong), specializing in attacking officialdom. The authorities detained Yu for more than forty days and deported him. Minhu's life came to an end, lasting only ninety-three days. In the autumn of the same year, Yu extended the invitation to Tan Shanwu to run Minxu Bao. Because he attacked Japan, the Japanese consul stationed in Shanghai requested the Shanghai Daotai to ban it. Its life was forty-two days. However, Yu did not lose heart. On September 9 of the following year, he founded Minli Bao in Shanghai. Those who wrote for it included Song Jiaoren (pen name Yufu), Shao Zhonghui (pen name Lizi), Fan Hongxian (pen name Guhong), Tan Shanwu (pen name Laotan), and Yu himself (pen name Saoxin). The daily printing volume was over 20,000 copies, and the printing presses ran day and night. It was popular for a time. It ceased publication until after the establishment of the Republic of China, after the Second Revolution, due to a lack of funds.

After the establishment of the Republic of China, there were also the so-called "Horizontal Three Principles of the People," referring to Minquan Bao, run by Dai Weitao (Tianchou), Guomin Xinwen, run by Lu Zhiyi, and Minbao Di San Bao, run by Deng Jiayan. Their opinions were also very radical.

### The Origin of Illustrated Newspapers: The Earliest Was "Children's Monthly Report," With "Dianshizhai Pictorial" Being the Most Outstanding

Illustrated books are like wordless news, accessible to all, and most capable of attracting readers. Nowadays, Shanghai newspapers often include illustrated supplements on anniversaries or scheduled dates. Examining the history of illustrated newspapers in Shanghai, the earliest was "Children's Monthly Report" (China's Paper) published in the first year of the Guangxu reign (1875), edited by J. M. W. Farnham. The copperplate illustrations were exquisite, but text remained primary, with illustrations as secondary. In August of the third year of Guangxu (September 1877), the Shenbao newspaper launched "Yingshi Pictorial," dedicated to publishing illustrations and descriptions of world affairs, customs, and landscapes. It was an irregular publication, lasting for only five volumes. In the sixth year of Guangxu, the Shanghai Sacred Teachings Bookstore published "Chinese Illustrated News," issued monthly until the second year of the Republic. On April 14th of the tenth year of Guangxu (May 8th, 1884), the Shenbao newspaper again launched "Dianshizhai Pictorial," publishing one issue every ten days. Its content consisted of "selecting joyful and astonishing events from the news, drawing them into illustrations, and attaching brief accounts of the events." Each issue contained eight illustrations, with meticulous brushwork, already influenced by Western painting styles of the time. It was discontinued after several years of publication. At the end of the Guangxu reign, the Shenbao publishing house reprinted it once, revised into one hundred volumes, and sold for twenty yuan.

Due to the rise of Dianshizhai, illustrated newspapers became more numerous. After Dianshizhai ceased publication, the Feijingge Pictorial, managed by Yuan He and Wu Youru, was launched in September of the sixteenth year of Guangxu (1890). It was also published every ten days, with ten pages per issue, bound in a folding style, with a red and black two-color cover, and printed using lithography on Yunshi paper. The difference in content from "Dianshizhai Pictorial" was that Dianshizhai Pictorial emphasized the recording of national affairs, while Feijingge Pictorial focused on depicting ladies and figures.

Following this, other illustrated newspapers emerged, with larger circulation numbers, such as "Illustrated Daily News" (founded in the first year of the Xuantong reign), which, in addition to news, included "Illustrations of Famous People and History," "Real Pictures of All Trades," "Landscape Paintings," and "International Commemorative Paintings," among other rich content. Besides this, "Shenzhou Pictorial," "Minxu Illustrated Daily News," "Hubao News Pictorial," "Shengxiangguan Pictorial," "Qixin Daily News," and "Qimin Shuguo Pictorial," were all very popular for a time.

However, the illustrated newspapers of this time, except for those operated by Westerners which used engraved copperplate printing and published content such as almanacs, biology, and scenery, were mostly printed using lithography by Chinese operators. The depictions were not necessarily realistic, and early illustrated newspapers mostly drew their material from sources similar to Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, unrelated to major affairs. It was not until the emergence of "Minli," "Yulun," "Shishi," "Taipingyang," and other illustrated newspapers that gradual progress was made, satirizing the current situation, and able to supplement the major newspapers. The true revolution of illustrated newspapers came after the prevalence of photographic copperplate printing. Around the time of the Restoration, images of the battles between the civilian army and the government army frequently appeared in newspapers. From then on, illustrations began to prominently display their importance in newspapers.

In the ninth year of the Republic, the Shibao newspaper launched "Illustrated Weekly," which was the beginning of modern illustrated newspapers in our country. It was successful because the newspaper's printing presses and platemaking machines were very sophisticated. On May 18th of the nineteenth year of the Republic, the Shenbao newspaper also launched "Illustrated Weekly," issued every Sunday, printed on double-page copperplate paper, and edited by Ge Gongzhen. Subsequently, the Xinwenbao newspaper also launched a special illustrated edition. The Chenbao newspaper, from its founding in the twenty-first year of the Republic, had the publication of an illustrated weekly. During the January 28th Incident, the illustrated editions of the Shenbao and Xinwenbao newspapers were suspended. In the twenty-third year of the Republic, the Shenbao newspaper restored "Illustrated Special Editions." The Xinwenbao newspaper, from the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, added "Current Affairs Photographs."

Recently, major newspaper offices all simultaneously publish illustrations and related news, naturally providing greater assistance to the function of news.

### Vicissitudes of Small Newspapers

The rise of small newspapers began after the Wuxu Reform in the late Qing Dynasty, with the theatrical newspapers leading the way, which were quite popular. Examining the small newspapers of that time, there were the following types:

Youxi Bao (later transformed into Fanhua Bao), Xiaolin Bao, Xiaoxian Bao, Yuyan Bao, Caifeng Bao, Xin Shanghai Bao, Hua Shijie, Hua Tian Ribao, Yilin Bao, Chunjiang Hua Yue Bao, Qixin Bao, Xiao Bao, Qu Bao, Wenshe Ribao, Yanyi Baihua Bao, Xiaoxiao Bao, Qiwen Bao, Bianlan Bao, Fangyan Bao, Yuxian Ribao, Fei Bao, Risho Shina Shoho (Japanese-run China Small News), and Tongsu Bao.

The contents of each newspaper mostly revealed street gossip, rare and secret events, and also included poetry, game texts, jokes, theater reviews, riddles, and more. Among them were many famous scholars, such as Li Boyuan, the founder of Youxi Bao (also known as Nanting Tingzhang, the author of "Officialdom Unmasked"). The chief editor of Caifeng Bao was Wu Yanren (the author of "Strange Phenomena Witnessed Over Twenty Years"), satirizing current malpractices with a sharp pen.

Since the Republic, small newspapers have also flourished several times, including Jing Bao, which had a very smooth sales volume. Until the eve of the War of Resistance, there were a total of thirty-five small newspapers in Shanghai: Xiao Chen Bao, Li Bao, Xin Bao, Nan Bao, Tiyu Zhoubao, Xingqi Bao, Xiaopengyou Ribao, Jiaoyu Ribao, Ningbo Ribao, Qiong Bao, Jin Bao, Jing Bao, Shidai Bao, Dongfang Ribao, Zhengqi Bao, Shehui Ribao, Hu Bao, Shidai Xinbao, Shangye Daobao, Wenhua Bao, Shijie Chenbao, Ertong Ribao, Xi Shijie, Tie Bao, Da Jing Bao, Xin Chunqiu, Xiao Ribao, Jingangzuan, Mingxing Ribao, Fuhrmos, Robin Han, Shanghai Bao, Fei Bao, Ertong Xinbao, Tiyu Shijie.

After the victory, influenced by the rise of square-format weekly magazines, the momentum of small newspapers suddenly declined. Currently, they are showing vigorous development, and many small newspapers have been successively launched. At present, small daily newspapers in Shanghai include Li Bao, Tie Bao, Robin Han, Hu Bao, Cheng Bao, Fei Bao, and Su Bao.

Statistics of Newspapers in This City

Currently, there are a total of thirty Chinese newspapers and six foreign newspapers published in Shanghai. Among the Chinese newspapers, there are fifteen large daily newspapers, eight small daily newspapers, six evening newspapers, and one noon newspaper. Among the foreign newspapers, there are three English daily newspapers, one English evening newspaper, one French daily newspaper, and one Russian daily newspaper.

### The Egg Industry Appeals to the Government for Assistance: Restore Pre-War Export Quantities, Increase Selling Prices and Promote Sales to Various Countries

[Special Report] Local egg industry magnates Zheng Yuanxing and Zheng Fangzheng, are currently appealing to the government for assistance with egg exports, and have drafted a lengthy opinion paper to be submitted to the authorities, hoping that with increased egg prices and government assistance, pre-war export quantities can be gradually restored within three years. The contents of their opinion paper are excerpted as follows:

I. A Brief History of the Egg Industry

The export of egg products from our country dates back to the late Qing Dynasty. Initially, only three types were exported: fresh eggs, preserved eggs, and alkali eggs. In 1903, crude egg factories emerged in response. There were five or six such factories nationwide, specializing in the production of dried and wet egg yolk and dried egg white for overseas sales. Later, with the outbreak of the First European War, sales surged, and crude egg factories sprang up like mushrooms after rain, reaching over a hundred factories. As for frozen egg factories, they were first established in 1908. By 1923, there were more than ten factories nationwide. Among them, British merchants had the most, followed by American merchants, and then Chinese merchants.

Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were still more than ten frozen egg factories, while only two or three dozen crude egg factories remained. Moreover, less than half of them were operating. Most of them belonged to Chinese merchants, with fewer German merchants. The remaining egg products exported to European countries each year amounted to approximately 45,000 tons of frozen eggs, 400,000 to 500,000 cases of shell eggs, and 5,000 tons of other egg products. Sales to the United Kingdom alone accounted for 80-90%, with a total annual value of over 40 million legal tender (equivalent to over 200 billion in current currency). According to the customs report, the export amount of egg products ranked second or third among all exports, indicating its importance. With the outbreak of the Pacific War, sea routes were blocked, and cargo transport was disrupted, leading to the successive shutdown of both frozen egg factories and crude egg factories, plunging them into dire straits.

II. Overview of Egg Factories

Crude egg factories are currently scattered in the inland provinces of our country, with approximately two or three dozen still in existence. Only three of them are located in Shanghai, all of which have been shut down for a long time, awaiting the day of export to resume operation.

There are eight frozen egg factories with British, American, and Chinese investment, totaling sixteen factories. Among them, two are in Hankou, one in Nanjing, one in Tianjin, three in Qingdao, and nine in Shanghai, all of which have also been shut down for a long time. If the selling price improves and meets the cost, they can resume operation. Moreover, the manufacturing capacity of each factory is very large, having been more than sufficient before the war, and even more so now.

III. Current State of the Egg Industry

Taking Shanghai as an example, since the egg factories stopped operating, egg factory workers have suffered from unemployment. As for egg firms, due to short-term capital, high expenses, and exploitation by usurers, as well as losses from fluctuating prices, many are on the verge of crisis, and closures have been frequently reported.

The unreasonable rise and fall of egg prices is due to the lack of formal manufacturers establishing procurement, resulting in a phenomenon where there are eggs in the interior but nowhere to sell, and money in the cities but no eggs to buy. Egg prices fluctuate unpredictably, sometimes yielding extraordinary profits, and sometimes incurring unexpected losses. As a result, egg firms and egg vendors lose their protection and shrink back. For example, in the past, when egg exports reached 70,000 to 80,000 tons, if the price of rice was 12 yuan per picul, the price of eggs would be 2,000 yuan per 100 catties. Last December, the price of rice was 61,000 yuan per picul, so the price of eggs should have been around 102,000 yuan. However, the total price of eggs last December was actually 217,000 yuan, more than double the normal price, which is absurd. Recently, the price of rice is 69,000 yuan per picul, so the price of eggs should be around 115,000 yuan, but the current price is as high as 350,000 yuan, more than double the normal price. Even if the demand is higher due to the New Year's holidays, according to past practice, it would only increase by up to 50%, certainly not more than double, causing harm to both egg firms and consumers. The impact on exports is even greater, which is regrettable.

IV. Current Difficulties

The United States, which used to be an importing country for fresh eggs and egg products, has now become an exporting country. The United Kingdom, which used to be an importing country, is still an importing country. In the past, 98-99% of the frozen eggs needed by that country were supplied by our country, with the remaining amount supplemented by Australia. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, for the past several years, the egg products needed have been supplied by countries such as the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Australia. Recently, in order to restore Sino-British trade, the United Kingdom is willing to purchase one-third of the required egg products from our country first, provided that the price is comparable to the selling price to that country. However, the prices of goods in our country have increased by 5,000 to 10,000 times compared to before the war. While the prices of goods in the United States and the United Kingdom have increased by up to double. The value of the US dollar is only 1,000 times that of before the war, and the pound sterling is only 800 times, which is too different to start with. Although the United Kingdom still has some consumption of frozen eggs (approximately one-third of pre-war levels), the highest purchase price is only 40% of China's estimated minimum cost, which is more than double the difference, making it difficult to reach a deal. Other egg products, such as dried egg white and honey yolk, have not yet been discussed in terms of consumption and price, which is deeply regrettable.

V. Future Plans

Egg production in our country is a rural sideline, which is of great importance. The egg products exported each year are all surplus from domestic consumption, and can be called the surplus resources of our country. If the pre-war prosperity of egg exports can be restored, it would be of great benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood. Our industry dares not belittle itself, and has always taken promoting exports and protecting the egg industry in the international market as its responsibility. In the past, the exported egg products included whole frozen eggs, frozen old powdered light egg yolk, old powdered alkaline egg yolk, new powdered salted egg yolk, dried yolk, fly yolk, whole egg flakes, etc. We now plan to promote and sell these products to countries that need egg products, increase the selling price, and then ask the government for assistance with relief loans or ask the government to purchase them, hoping to gradually restore the pre-war export quantity within three years.

### Manchester Chamber of Commerce Report: Economic Situation in the Far East Improves, Requests Authorities to Reconsider Import Permit Regulations for China

[Reuters, Manchester, 18th] According to the report of the China and Far East Group of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce: The general situation in the Far East has improved slightly after passing through an extremely difficult year. The problems in the British Far Eastern territories are mostly economic rather than political, such as the problem of delayed unloading in Singapore. Malaya, Hong Kong, and Borneo have all received cotton cloth allocations for 1946, and except for Borneo, Malaya and Hong Kong have stopped official purchases and resumed private imports. However, Lancashire goods still cannot meet the huge demand, and exporters are eagerly awaiting increased production to consolidate their advantage gained from the absence of Japanese competition. The relationship between these two problems is particularly important, and the Manchester Chamber of Commerce has submitted recommendations to the British authorities regarding the future of the Japanese textile industry. Domestic turmoil affects British trade with China. The Chinese authorities' promulgation of import permit regulations last month, temporarily prohibiting the import of cotton goods into China, has severely hit Lancashire. This has greatly disappointed British businesses, as British exporters have increased supply quantities to Chinese businesses under the recently announced free export plan, despite the widespread shortage of cotton cloth in countries around the world. The Chamber of Commerce has lodged a strong protest with the British authorities, making every effort to get China to reconsider its decision.

### Central Cooperative Bank Launches Civilian Loans

Since its establishment, the Shanghai branch of the Central Cooperative Bank has been very strict in reviewing loan requests from cooperative societies in various places. Recently, the bank approved two loans: 50 million yuan to the Pinghu Brick Kiln Production Cooperative, and 20 million yuan to the Huaxing Farm Supply and Marketing Cooperative. In terms of interest rates, 6.5% is charged to production cooperative societies, and 7.5% is charged to other consumer cooperative societies. Loan approvals of more than 5 million yuan are requested to be reported to the head office, and those over 50 million yuan need to be reported to the Four Banks Joint Office. Currently, the cooperative societies applying for loans are all requesting more than 5 million yuan; therefore, they can only be lent after being approved by the head office. In terms of deposits, cooperative societies and troops have deposited 3 billion yuan in the bank, and the head office has allocated more than 1 billion yuan. The bank also plans to select a standard cooperative society in each district cooperative, where civilians account for a larger percentage, and use more than ten people to ensure environmental protection, and issue loans to civilians to enable them to make a living. This matter can be implemented soon. The bank will also establish a loan committee within this week, which can review loans to avoid indiscriminate issuance and being taken advantage of.

### Shipping Industry Organizes Joint Institutions: Fully Utilize Compensation Ships, President Song Approves Allocation of 120,000 Tons of Ships

Regarding the issue of compensation for losses of private ships, the War Loss Compensation Committee of the Shipping Industry Association has repeatedly requested the government, and has now obtained the formal approval of Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen to allocate 120,000 tons of ships, worth a total of US$12 million. Among them, US$3.6 million will be used to compensate for losses, and the remaining US$8.4 million will be handled by the Four Banks Joint Office with low-interest loans, to be repaid in installments. Half of these 120,000 tons of ship space, 150 ships, will be ordered by the government from the United States, and the other half will be handled by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The ships ordered by the government, including giant ships of more than 10,000 tons such as Victory and Liberty, have recently been arriving in batches on their way to China to compensate the various private shipping companies. The issue of the use of these compensation ships, each company now decides to jointly organize institutions, to carry out operations, currently preparing, is expected to be formally established early next month.

### Work Comes to an End: Temporary Review Committee for Production Loans to Conclude Business Tomorrow, Unfinished Matters Transferred to Four Banks for Handling, 12 Billion Yuan in Loans Approved Yesterday

The Temporary Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans of the Four Banks Joint Office has been reviewing loan applications to rescue production enterprises and manufacturers, helping them to tide over the difficult year-end period, which has been effective in stabilizing finance and the social economy. Now that the work has come to an end, the committee has decided to conclude its business on the eve of the Lunar New Year. Future loan applications from manufacturers will be transferred to the Shanghai branch of the Four Banks Joint Office for handling. The committee is scheduled to hold its last regular meeting tomorrow to review applications received before Tuesday of this week. Applications after Tuesday will be reviewed and handled by the Shanghai branch of the Four Banks Joint Office.

At its fifteenth regular meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by Huo Yamin, with the participation of Li Fusun, Xu Jilin, Qin Runqing, Gu Chunfan, Lin Fengbao and more than twenty experts, loans totaling seven items were approved, totaling 12 billion yuan.

### Small Factories in the 18th District Request Improved Loan Terms

[Special Report] The People's Representative Assembly of the 18th District (Tilanqiao District) of this city, with the year-end approaching, and the production loan funds for small and medium-sized earth factories having no source, making it difficult to maintain, has no choice but to appeal to the Municipal Council. According to the Representative Assembly, there are many small and medium-sized factories in the district. Although the Central Government has given special treatment to set up production loan funds, the conditions seem to be too strict, and a bank guarantee is required. However, small factories often have little contact with the financial community, and asking for a bank guarantee is easier said than done. With the year-end approaching, capital turnover is difficult, affecting the future of small industries. Therefore, they appeal to the Municipal Council to forward a request to the Central Government to change the method, changing the bank guarantee to a certified shop guarantee, in order to save the crisis. After receiving the petition from the association, the Municipal Council has agreed to study it and present it to the Central Government for instructions. However, due to the year-end approaching, the time is too short, and there is no way to rush through it. Therefore, a solution may not be obtained this year.

### Gold Prices Soar in Hankou

[Special Report from Hankou, 19th] Since the news of the issuance of new Customs Gold Units by the Shanghai Central Bank, prices of all commodities here have risen, and gold has increased to 440,000 yuan.

### New Atmosphere in Shenyang: Rural Farmers Enter the City to Buy New Year Goods

[Special Report from Shenyang, 19th] In the past week, foreign merchants and our economic institutions have purchased large quantities of soybeans, increasing the price from 7-8 yuan per catty to 14-15 yuan. Sorghum has increased from 7-8 yuan per catty to 11 yuan. Rural farmers are coming to the city to sell grain for money, buying New Year's paper, flour, dried vegetables, and cloth. This is something that was not seen during the enemy puppet control period.

### Yingkou Freezes Over: Shipping Suspended

According to news from the shipping industry in this city yesterday, we have just received a report that Yingkou has frozen over, and ships from Shanghai to the Northern Ocean are stopping at that port. The shipping companies have temporarily suspended accepting cargo to Yingkou. However, Qinhuangdao and Tianjin and other ports will still operate normally.

### Korean Ginseng Transported to China in Large Quantities

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] According to news from Korea, Korean ginseng is being transported to China in large quantities by barge, and small-scale trade between the two countries is very active. Korean red pepper, peanuts, and seaweed are exported to China, and Chinese paper and medicines are exported to Korea. The Korean Provisional Government has requested the US occupation authorities in Korea, and the Chinese government to reconsider its regulations prohibiting the import of ginseng as a luxury item, but has not yet received a response. At this time, the Korean Provisional Government is still issuing export permits for ginseng, most of which is transported to China.

### Gasoline Supply Still Has Not Returned to Normal

The gasoline supply problem, which had been suspended for a while, has been restored since the day before yesterday, but with a limit of three gallons per car. Therefore, the gasoline stations yesterday were still unable to return to normal operation. The cars lining up to refuel at each station were like long snakes. It is understood that this phenomenon is expected to disappear within one or two days. Companies such as Mobil have ample reserves. The delay in unloading was due to the fact that the gasoline that arrived in Shanghai could not expedite the import permit procedures. They are actively processing, and unloading can be done within days.

### Product Survey: Viscose Rayon Fiber

——Its Application and Advantages in Woolen Products——

Viscose rayon staple, because of its ability to be used in woolen mills, often gives people the impression that it can be used as a substitute for wool to supplement wool reserves. However, in reality, this is not the case. The advantages of viscose rayon staple fibers can be called a supplement to wool, and can be used to weave fabrics that are difficult to achieve with pure wool. The gauze fabrics spun by the cotton spinning method in recent years are sufficient to prove that these types of fabrics are not purely imitating cotton, wool, silk, and other fabrics, but each has its own inherent characteristics. Sometimes, even if they are mixed with other fibers, the purpose is only to achieve a tactile sensation that is difficult to obtain with viscose rayon staple fibers alone. The appearance and touch of the gauze spun by worsted spinning are completely different from those obtained by cotton spinning. This is because the denier number, fiber length, and twist of viscose rayon vary, and the natural fibers mixed in during blending are also difficult to be uniform. The most common deniers are 3 and 5.5, both shiny and matte, and the length is about 4.5 to 6 or 7 inches. Slightly coarser ones can also be used, but longer and finer ones perform better and have greater tensile strength. Coarse fibers are often harder, making the spun yarn coarse and hard. The greatest advantage of rayon staple fiber now lies in its gentle properties, which allow it to be spun with coarse wool to weave soft fabrics. It can also be dyed in multiple colors using cross-dye effects. If a small amount of wool is added, it can still be made into washable sportswear fabrics.

Fabric Weaving—Viscose rayon staple fibers have less shrinkage after washing than wool. Therefore, if 100% viscose rayon staple fiber is used, the width can be saved by 6% compared to pure wool. If wool and silk are half each, it can be saved by 3%. If ____%, then ____% can be saved. The number of warp yarns per inch should be increased, and the number of weft yarns per inch should also be increased. Also, due to the different specific gravities of wool and viscose rayon staple fibers, if the same volume as pure wool products is desired, 100% more viscose rayon must be added. In other words, 10 ounces of pure wool fabric should use 11 ounces of viscose rayon to achieve the same result. To achieve the desired effect, more twist should be added when using viscose rayon staple fiber compared to 100% worsted wool. Men's clothing materials—Gabardines and tropical fabrics are especially suitable for mixing viscose rayon fiber with wool. These types of clothing materials mostly use finer yarns. Adding viscose rayon fiber makes them easier to weave. For example, 100% wool is extremely difficult to spin into high counts. If a small amount of viscose rayon is added, it will be easier to spin and have better tensile strength. This type of fabric is usually dyed and sold after weaving. If cross-dyed, the wool or viscose silk remains white. If spinning ______ or ______ finer outerwear materials with higher counts, it is best to use 3 denier fibers. A 5.5 denier is too coarse for this type of yarn. If the tropical fabric is spun no higher than ______, then 5.5 denier is sufficient. Adding a small amount of Angora wool to tropical fabrics can give the fabric a slight elasticity. Wool and rayon spun into serge and flannel are quite eye-catching and very easy to piece-dye. For excellent results, use finer wool to increase its fulling properties and make it thicker. Many other types of fabrics, such as sharkskin and plaids, can be woven in the same way.

Women's Clothing—Any clothing material made from wool and rayon that can be used for men's clothing can also be popular among women. In the past two years, women's outerwear and pullover materials have been flannel, worsted fabrics, and military crepe fabrics such as twill, which are commonly used in men's clothing. Therefore, adding viscose rayon fiber to increase the yarn's tensile strength and enable the weaving of lightweight fabrics, and because rayon is easy to dye, fabrics spun from its fiber and wool will surely have a bright future. Moreover, since the colors of cross-dyeing are endless, the future can be predicted to be colorful, gorgeous, and beautiful.

### Sichuan Provincial Government Rectifies Academic Style: Dismisses Nanchong Advanced Sericulture School; Sends Troublemaking Students to Court for Investigation

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 19th] The provincial Nanchong Advanced Vocational School expelled a student for theft last month. A small number of illegal students took this opportunity to stir up trouble, gathered a crowd to destroy the school, injure the principal, and assault the training and academic affairs directors. After the Eleventh District Commissioner's Office sent personnel to persuade them, they once again incited students to plot illegal activities. Now, in order to rectify the academic style, the provincial government has ordered the school to be dismissed and the troublemaking students sent to court for investigation.

### United States Will Send Students to Fujian Union University for Study

Promoting Sino-American Cultural Relations

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 19th] In order to promote Sino-American cultural relations, the United States plans to send a number of students to study at Fujian Union University. This matter has been negotiated between the US Information Service and the local Union University authorities. If the number of students is more than five, a special class can be set up with instruction in English. If these students need to acquire Chinese culture and special knowledge of Fujian Province, the Union University authorities will provide assistance and guidance. Furthermore, the American Association of University Women previously held an examination in Guangzhou at the end of last year to recruit Chinese female students for free study in the United States, and two students were admitted.

### Eight Middle Schools in Beijing Implement Physical Fitness Tests

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] As of today, the physical fitness tests for students in Beijing schools organized by the Ministry of Education have been implemented in eight schools: Beijing Private Mingde Girls' Middle School, Jinling Women's University Affiliated Middle School, Zhonghua Girls' Middle School, Municipal Second Girls' Middle School, Municipal First Vocational School, Municipal Normal School, Private Huiwen Girls' Middle School, and YMCA Middle School. More than 4,000 students have been tested, accounting for about one-third of all middle school students in the city. Currently, because Beijing schools are starting their winter vacation from today, the tests have been temporarily suspended and will be continued when school resumes in February.

### Wuhan University Student Unrest: Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Handle; Student Union Urges President Zhou to Stay

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] It is reported that a few students at Wuhan University recently used the pretext of demanding an increase in student demobilization fees to stir up trouble. President Zhou Gengsheng repeatedly tried to persuade them without success, and became discouraged, telegraphing the Ministry of Education to resign. It is heard that the Ministry has replied with a telegram earnestly requesting him to stay, and has sent Inspector Wu Zhao to the university to assist in handling the student unrest.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 18th] The Wuhan University strike is coming to an end. Most students expressed regret upon hearing that President Zhou Gengsheng had resigned. At 7:00 PM tonight, the student union held an emergency meeting and resolved to urge President Zhou to stay, and discussed preparations for resuming classes. An open letter to President Zhou was also passed on the spot, asking him to return to school as soon as possible to preside over school affairs.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 19th] The Wuhan University student unrest has not yet reached a satisfactory conclusion after mediation by the alumni association. However, the trend of the student unrest has obviously eased. The university student union recently published an open letter, stating that they were urging President Zhou to stay, saying that Zhou's academic status was generally recognized. If they lost an excellent mentor due to the radical remarks of a few students, it would be something that most students would not want. They hoped that all unnecessary doubts could be quickly resolved through reconciliation. At the same time, the Ministry of Education also sent a telegram to President Zhou to urge him to stay, and sent Inspector Wu Zhaotang to the school to thoroughly investigate the truth. It is generally believed that the student unrest will soon subside. However, it is reported that Zhou has left Wuhan for Beijing, and many students have also returned home for the Lunar New Year, so it may be difficult to officially resume classes within days.

### Soochow, Zhijiang, and St. John's Three Universities Merge After Approval

Soochow, Zhijiang, and St. John's three church universities will merge and first form a committee. Shan Yan'e and Qing Liang Xiaochu will serve as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. The committee is scheduled to hold its first preparatory meeting on February 7. In principle, it has been decided that Soochow University will be responsible for running the Law School and the Science School, St. John's will be responsible for running the School of Arts and Sciences and the Medical School, and Zhijiang University will be responsible for running the School of Engineering and the School of Business. Formal combined classes will begin after the summer vacation. Construction of the new campus will not begin until the American churches have raised enough donations to assist China, which is expected to be US$3.5 million. Because the fundraising campaign is expected to take five years to complete, the construction project will also take a considerable amount of time. The new campus will be in Shanghai, with an area of approximately 1,000 acres. Classes are currently being held on the existing campuses. The three schools currently have students: St. John's about 2,000, Soochow about 1,500, and Zhijiang more than 1,000, totaling more than 4,500 students, and 400 to 500 faculty and staff. In the future, it can be called the largest university in the country.

### Nationally Designated Textbooks: Reproduction Prohibited

Copyright Will Become a Problem

[Our Nanjing Air Dispatch] Recently, after the Ministry of Education issued an order to all provinces and cities to ban the reproduction of nationally designated textbooks, those who profited by reprinting and pirating have slightly disappeared. Even the "special agent editions" popular in the Beijing-Shanghai line area are being investigated and banned. The original name of the "special agent edition" was "service edition." The pirates claimed to be special agent personnel and forced various parties to purchase them, so the publishing industry called them special agent editions. Recently, after the Ministry of Education received reports, it has paid special attention. As for the copyright of nationally designated textbooks, after being sent to the Ministry of Interior for registration, the Ministry of Interior has registered the clause prohibiting reproduction and publication rights. However, whether the copyright should belong to the Ministry of Education or the various bookstores that published the books is still under investigation. This is because the Ministry of Education, under the leadership of Minister Wang Shijie in the 25th year [of the Republic, 1936], signed a contract with various bookstores, requiring them to pay all manuscript fees. Later, during the Ministry's compilation and writing in the 31st year [of the Republic, 1942], it again ordered the seven bookstores that published the books to compile and write manuscripts separately for selection. Later, the scope of use also encroached on the copyrights of various books that had not been submitted by various companies. The situation for subjects such as elementary school arithmetic, high elementary school arithmetic, and natural science is even more special. The Ministry of Education was originally not within the scope of compilation and printing, and directly borrowed all the completed manuscripts from various companies. The companies had never sold the copyrights and had previously obtained copyright certificates from the Ministry of Interior. Therefore, according to the provisions of the Copyright Law, the copyright issues of various books are quite subtle.

### Thirteen Christian Universities Nationwide Jointly Launch Fundraising Campaign; Representative Conference to Be Held on the 8th of Next Month

[Our Dispatch] In response to the grand campaign of American churches to donate US$15 million to Christian universities in China, St. John's University, Shanghai University, and Soochow Law School in this city, Nanjing Jinling University, Jinling Women's College, Hangzhou Zhijiang University, Chengdu West China Union University, Peking Yenching University, Jinan Qilu University, Wuchang Huazhong University, Fuzhou Fujian Union University, South China Women's College, and Guangdong Lingnan University and other thirteen Christian universities, have launched a domestic fundraising campaign and organized the China Christian University Joint Fundraising Campaign Committee, which is scheduled to convene a representative conference of the thirteen universities in Shanghai on February 8, at which the Fundraising Campaign Committee will be officially established. The fundraising target is projected to be 10 billion yuan in legal tender, and the country will be divided into five regions: Southeast, Northwest, and Central for fundraising. The fundraising targets are the central and local governments, state-owned enterprises, Chinese and foreign companies and businesses in China, and individuals. All donations will be designated to be collected by six banks: Central, China, Communications, Farmers, Jincheng, and Zhejiang Industrial.

### Ministry of Education Plans to Establish Vocational School of Fisheries

[Our Nanjing Air Dispatch] Fisheries education not only trains technical personnel for fisheries production, but also cultivates water operators, defends against enemy fishing intrusions, and maintains maritime rights. At the beginning of the victory, the Chairman specifically telegraphed that the importance of China's fisheries after the war was significant and related to people's livelihood, and that the training of fisheries personnel should be planned and implemented as soon as possible. At that time, the Ministry of Education immediately followed up and instructed the education departments and bureaus of coastal and riverine provinces and cities to earnestly comply. Recently, in order to establish promotion and demonstration facilities, it has been decided to establish a national senior vocational school of fisheries, and Mr. Wang Zhaomo has been appointed as the principal. Mr. Wang has served as a professor in the Department of Fisheries at Guangdong Zhongshan University and other schools. After being appointed, he recently flew from Guangdong to Beijing to begin preparations and has consulted with relevant parties to proceed.

### Youyou Loses to Longjie Juniors; 2-0, No Score in the First Half

In the A-Group soccer league, Longjie faced Youyou yesterday afternoon at Jinyuan Park. The audience was sparse. As a result, Longjie defeated Youyou with a score of 2-0. There were no scores in the first half.

No Achievements

When the whistle blew to start the game, Youyou took advantage of the downwind, and Longjie had the right to kick off. Gu Dirong moved the ball and passed it to Gao Xiuqing. Xiao Gao was about to advance quickly, but was blocked by Yun Feng. Youyou took the opportunity to attack. Zhang Zhongqian launched troops on the left and passed it to the center. Cao Laosan passed it to Mao Hongfa. Xiao Mao's footwork was not spiritual, and he worked in vain. Longjie attacked again. At seven minutes, Gu Dirong received support from the rear and turned around with a wonderful shot. The ball came out urgently and abnormally, but it hit the post properly, causing it to bounce out. Youyou was not killed. At twenty minutes, Ya Tuo Mali started an uprising in the middle and rushed to the Longjie hinterland. Fortunately, Zhao Yongfang cleared with a big kick. The two sides fought in a mixed battle. By the end of the first half, there were no achievements.

Youyou Does Not Defend

Changing sides and fighting again, Longjie brought Yu Musen into the field, replacing Shen Jinda. Youyou then switched Ya Tuo Mali and Lei Shuping, and Zhang Zhongqian and Mao Hongfa interchanged positions. After contact, Youyou attacked against the wind. Longjie's rear defense was strict and could not be penetrated deeply. After five minutes, Youyou's soldiers gradually showed signs of fatigue. Longjie saw the weakness, and Jin Lusheng dribbled the ball quickly. Rong Guang came out to block. The ball bounced back on Gu Dirong's body, and Rong Cai's line of sight was blocked, allowing the ball to roll into the net. 1-0, Longjie opened the scoring first. Longjie's forwards went deep again. Luo Xulai was tricked, Zhang Rongcai was difficult to defend alone, and was ravaged again, 2-0. Only seven minutes had passed since the start of the second half. Afterwards, although Youyou tried hard to counterattack, Longjie was careful, and the rear defense was extremely thorough, making it impossible to succeed. When the statutory time was up, Longjie defeated Youyou with a score of 2-0.

### Recent Developments in American Libraries: Harvard University Has the Largest Collection

University libraries, from the perspective of research and investigation, should occupy the top position in the library system. The main difference between American universities and other educational institutions lies in their research work, which is the hallmark of a university. Therefore, university libraries are established to assist in research work.

University Libraries

In terms of sheer volume, eleven American university libraries have collections exceeding one million volumes. Harvard University boasts the largest collection with over four and a half million volumes, followed by Yale University with approximately three and a half million volumes. Columbia University and the University of Illinois each have around two million volumes. In addition to these eleven major repositories, there are nineteen other university libraries with collections ranging from 500,000 to one million volumes. Furthermore, there are twenty other university libraries whose collections possess research value. Thus, there are a total of fifty university libraries in the United States whose collections are of significant importance to scholars and researchers.

Specialized School Libraries

American specialized school libraries are similar to university libraries, but their research significance is generally less. This is because few specialized school libraries have sufficient funding and the need to collect research materials. However, some of them possess extraordinary special collections.

Public Libraries

American public libraries rank third in terms of quantity. Every city or town has one, with eight possessing collections exceeding one million volumes and sixteen with collections between 500,000 and one million volumes. The New York Public Library is one of the world's great libraries, with over four million volumes and a rich collection of various books. The Boston Public Library has a long history, resulting in rich collections in major academic disciplines. Some public libraries are renowned for their special collections, such as Cleveland's collection of popular histories and Detroit's Burton Historical Collection of Midwestern history.

State Libraries

The New Jersey and Pennsylvania libraries, established in 1796, were the forerunners of American libraries. Since then, each state has established one. Some have also established branches, such as legislative reference libraries, state court or supreme court libraries, state archives, and historical commissions. The primary materials of research value collected by state libraries are local newspapers and state documents, thus their research value is limited. Various libraries associated with the federal government have been rapidly catching up in recent years, and their importance is growing daily. The Library of Congress is the foremost among them. It has a rich collection of various books, particularly renowned for its collections in social sciences, history, fine arts, and music. From a certain perspective, it is the largest library in the world. In addition, there are libraries established by various departments and bureaus of the government. Some of their special collections are the best in the world. The Army Medical Library has the world's foremost collection of medical classics. The Office of Education has the largest collection of education books, and the Department of Agriculture has the largest collection of agricultural books. The Military Academy has the second largest collection of military science books in the world. The Geographical Observation Office has the leading collection of geography books in the United States. The Department of Labor's collection of books on labor and social welfare is unmatched by other libraries in the United States.

Reference Libraries

American reference libraries, although few in number, are quite important. They are privately funded and have no connection with educational institutions. Two examples are the John Crerar Library in Chicago, which specializes in science, technology, and social sciences, and the Newberry Library, which specializes in literature, history, and art.

Special Libraries

American special libraries are characterized by the richness of their research materials, but the types of materials held by each library vary, hence the name "special libraries." The largest part of this category is related to industry and commerce. They are established to help business people, scientists, and journalists find materials. They focus on the latest current information, so historical books are not easily found. Therefore, no matter how complete their collection of current factual materials, they are still insufficient in the eyes of scholars. These libraries are naturally concentrated in highly industrialized areas. The second category is established by societies, associations, or similar organizations. For example, many cities have law libraries established by bar associations and medical libraries established by medical associations for their members. Some are first-rate in their respective fields, such as the New York City Bar Association, which is the largest law library, and the New York Academy of Medicine Library, whose medical books rank first in the United States. The Engineering Societies Library is composed of four engineering societies and is the largest engineering library in the United States. Other examples are too numerous to list. In short, their collections are specialized and of great value to scholars specializing in one subject.

Private Libraries

American private libraries, in this final category of private collection libraries, one can sometimes discover the most valuable books and manuscripts in the United States.

### Prospects for the Wool Industry in the Northwest

— Our Correspondent Li Chi from Xi'an

Xi'an, 4th (Airmail)

I happened to stumble upon a folk song in a used bookstore, describing the unique harvest scene in the Northwest, so beautiful it was like a technicolor movie:

"The wind is blowing the grass, The children are counting the lambs."

In fact, animal husbandry, especially sheep farming, occupies a significant proportion of the overall economy of the Northwest and has great prospects. Shaanxi is one province in the Northwest, but major livestock production is limited to the Yulin area in northern Shaanxi; Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi are not worth mentioning. However, most of the trade in animal hides and wool from all provinces in the Northwest, whether shipped to Central or Northern China, or exported overseas via Shanghai, is transacted in Xi'an. Especially this year, due to the war along the Pinghan Railway in North China, Xi'an has become the distribution center for fur and hide products from the Northwest.

It's quite pitiful to say that, despite the limited amount of animal hides in the Northwest, the leather industry has always remained at the small-scale handicraft stage. During the War of Resistance, orders for military leather products once boosted the development of the leather industry. Government-run leather factories had considerable output, and small-scale leather cooperatives were established along the railway line. However, in the past year, they have all declined one after another. According to incomplete statistics, about one-quarter to one-third of the sixty-odd leather factories, large and small, in the province are at a standstill, and the rest are struggling to stay afloat. Imported leather is continuously transported in along the railway. Fortunately, leather products are bulky and costly to transport. Except for high-quality leather for shoes, medium- and low-quality products can still retain their market locally, leaving a glimmer of hope for the suffocating leather handicraft industry.

(1) The Journey of Wool

Before the War of Resistance, a large amount of raw, untanned hides from the Northwest were shipped east via Xi'an for processing in Shanghai or exported overseas, to countries as near as Japan and as far as Europe. After the leather underwent a tanning process, it was shipped back to the Far East for sale. This sales channel is certainly out of the question this year. We should be grateful if a few ships come and transport some goods.

Other animal wool products have also had a history of "overseas travel," including everything from expensive fox fur to the cheapest wool. There are many camels in the Northwest, and the camel wool spinning industry has a considerable foundation in Tianjin and Shanghai. However, in terms of quantity, the market for sheep wool is much larger than that for camel wool. In commodity trading, sheep wool can be divided into sheepskin with wool and sheared wool without skin. The latter is further divided into "spring wool" and "autumn wool" according to the shearing time. The market value of "spring wool" is often only 70% of that of "autumn wool."

Sheepskin with wool has no industrial value because it can be directly tailored into winter clothing. Only sheared wool is the main raw material for the wool industry. Roughly classified by finished products, there are carpets, fine wool yarn for machine-woven wool fabrics (equivalent to cotton yarn for cotton fabrics), and coarse wool yarn for hand-weaving, commonly known as wool yarn.

(2) Coarse, Fine, Soft, and Hard

Among the provinces in the Northwest, Qinghai has the largest output of sheep wool, followed by Gansu. However, in terms of wool quality (including color, length, crimp, thickness, fiber strength, fiber elasticity, grease content, etc.), Ningxia wool should be ranked first.

Generally speaking, the disadvantage of wool produced in the Northwest is that the wool is too coarse. Specifically, the following figures can be cited: the thickness of American and Australian wool is only about 0.02 millimeters, while the thickness of wool produced in the Northwest often exceeds this figure by three or four times. Because it is coarse, it leads to many unsatisfactory aspects. For example, Australian wool yarn feels soft to the touch, while the wool strands of Northwest wool yarn sometimes feel like bamboo splinters or wood splinters. At the same time, there is also a huge difference in weight between the two. Because one pound of wool raw material spun into wool yarn of the same thickness will produce a longer woven length with Australian wool than with Northwest wool. This difference can also be reversed in this way: a wool garment of the same size and density will be much lighter if woven with Australian wool than with Northwest wool.

(3) Planning a Giant Factory

In other aspects, such as the crimp and elasticity of wool fibers, the products of the Northwest are only a fraction of those of American and Australian breeds. Therefore, many foreigners who come to the Northwest for inspection, especially Americans, often argue that the wool industry in the Northwest should focus on weaving carpets for export to earn foreign exchange. This statement is not very accurate, because carpets and rugs are luxury textiles. Although they can be exported, it would be a "colonial economic policy" to completely rely on this for the wool spinning industry, according to an expert with a different perspective. Yes, the outlet for wool in the Northwest should be centered on the wool textile industry for clothing, and the supply should be targeted at domestic livelihood needs. In this regard, simple wool spinning factories have already been established in Xi'an and Lanzhou during the war. Recently, there have been repeated attempts in Xi'an to raise funds to establish a giant wool spinning factory, and the Qinghai authorities are also said to have a similar plan. The current difficulty is that foreigners are unwilling to sell the latest machines, and are only willing to sell second-rate old goods. How to transport the purchased goods and when they will arrive is also a problem.

(4) Excellent New Breeds

The shortcomings of wool raw materials can be improved. There are two methods, both based on Mendel's famous law of inheritance in biology. One is "selective breeding," where good local breeds are crossbred with each other to fix their good qualities. In this way, the inferior factors can be eliminated and good breeds can be propagated over a long period of time. Another method is "international marriage," that is, so-called "hybridization," where local good breeds are crossbred with good foreign breeds, taking the best from both to obtain excellent new breeds. These two methods each have their own strengths and can be carried out simultaneously. According to the American experience in wool breed improvement, both have clear efficiency, and the improvement rate of the latter is twice as fast as the former by 20%. Shaanxi Province's cotton and wool improvement is being carried out using this principle. However, it is not possible to see immediate results in whoever does it. We are optimistic that after several years, wool and animal hair produced in the Northwest will shine in international trade and the domestic wool spinning industry.

### Archaeological Work Begins in Hsinchu, Excavating Prehistoric Relics

— Our Correspondent Yang Yu in Taiwan

Taipei, 11th (Airmail)

According to existing historical documents, the earliest records about Taiwan can be found in the story of Xu Fu's voyage into the sea to "seek immortality" during the 28th year of Emperor Qin Shi Huang (219 BC), when he reached Yizhou. After research, it is known that the Yizhou at that time was actually today's Taiwan. Subsequently, during the Han, Jin, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, historical documents provided more accurate and reliable records, proving that a large number of Han people had migrated from Fujian and Guangdong to Taiwan in ancient times. The aboriginal Malay people, accustomed to conservatism in the struggle for survival, gradually maintained their tribal organization and retreated to the high mountains and ridges of the east, which is where the "raw barbarians" can be found in Taiwan today.

This time, the Taiwan Provincial Compilation and Translation Institute is engaged in the excavation of shell mounds in Houlongdi and Yuanli in Hsinchu County, hoping to unearth prehistoric relics from the soil in addition to historical documents, as concrete evidence.

Old Clues, New Discoveries

In November 1941, Professor Hayasaka Ichiro of Taipei Imperial University and his assistant Mr. Kaneko discovered the Houlongdi shell mound during a geological survey. It is located in the northwest, west, southeast, and east, backed by mountains, from which one can overlook the beautiful scenery of the Nanshi Creek valley, 2.5 kilometers from the coastline. At that time, only a slight excavation was carried out, and a little sand was collected. Later, in the 11th volume, 1st issue of "Scientific Taiwan," an excavation report was published, but it was only a superficial observation record of the collected data. The Yuanli shell mound is located in Yuanli Township, Miaoli District, Hsinchu County, 1.4 kilometers east of the Yuanli Station on the longitudinal railway line and 2.5 kilometers from the coast. It was discovered by Dr. Tanhide Keinosuke, a professor of geology at Taipei Imperial University, during a geological survey in September 1935. Afterwards, a report on the shell composition was also published in the "Journal of the Geological Society of Taiwan." In order to further study the relationship between the shell layer and the cultural layer, the Provincial Compilation and Translation Institute, based on these old clues, set out on November 17 of last year to conduct a large-scale scientific excavation project. Yang Yunping, editor and director of the Taiwan Research Group of the Institute, together with Kokuubu Naoichi, a Japanese editor of the Institute who has made great achievements in the study of history and literature, and Dr. Kanaseki Takeo, professor of anatomy at Taiwan University (also a well-known anthropologist), excavated continuously in the two locations for ten days. They obtained new discoveries that have made significant contributions to the study of prehistoric Taiwan, adding a glorious page to the history of antiquities excavation in Taiwan.

Valuable Discoveries: Polished Stone Tools and Iron Tools

The lower layer of the shell mound contains a particularly large number of animal bones, especially deer and wild boar, indicating that this area was once a primitive area covered by dense forests and weeds. It is hoped that zoologists can study these excavated animal remains. On a deer skull, three or four traces of iron tool cuts were found. After the excavators' efforts, they found a rusty and rotten iron knife underground. The excavation of this extremely valuable object for research and textual criticism added infinite excitement and a hundredfold courage to the excavators. The rich harvest of this excavation should be attributed to the discovery of this iron tool. In addition, numerous rough-made stone tools and a small number of delicate polished stone tools were also unearthed. It is a miracle that relatively recent iron tools and primitive stone tools were found at the same time. The excavators' tentative conclusion is that the prehistoric era of Taiwan was characterized by the conservatism of the inhabitants, and that the island was not as easily disturbed by the outside world as the mainland, so this situation occurred. That era was actually

a period of coexistence of bronze and stone. As for how many years it has been since then, that is a mystery that needs to be gradually solved!

Black Pottery Patterns: Same as Domestic Unearthed Items

Black pottery, gray pottery, and reddish-brown earthenware were unearthed together here. Their shapes are very similar to those of ancient Chinese bronzes. Further study of the geometric and wavy patterns of the black pottery reveals many similarities with the culture of Hong Kong's Boliao Chau, and they are completely identical to the black pottery patterns unearthed in Liangzhu Town, Hang County, in China not long ago. Black pottery culture has always been centered in northern China, gradually expanding southward. According to past successive discoveries of black pottery with the same patterns in places such as Xiongji in the eastern three provinces and northern Korea, Yangshao and Anyang in Henan Province, Chengziya, and Liangzhu Town in Hang County, this theory is very correct. In Taiwan, black pottery culture has always been more developed in the south and central regions, but the discovery of black pottery in Houlongdi and Yuanli now proves that the black pottery culture in Taiwan developed from south to north. From these subtle relationships, we are convinced that the black pottery culture of prehistoric Taiwan was transmitted to southern Taiwan from southern China. Although the annual excavations in China have not yet reached areas such as Fujian in southern China, the excavators of the Hsinchu antiquities are more confident that the coast of southern China is a hub of north-south cultural exchange, and will one day tell us concrete evidence. We also hope that our domestic peers will conduct a responsive excavation, which will not only provide a factual answer to this assumption, but also find a path for ancient Chinese culture, which is also a work of high value.

Agate Products: Ornaments of the Highland Tribes

Mixed among the pottery, stone tools, shell drums, and ink bones, several fragments of agate were also found. Most of the ornaments used by the highland tribes and Pingpu tribes in the mountains of eastern Taiwan are made of agate beads, and the styles of the unearthed antiquities are consistent with the existing ones, which proves that these ornaments were already in use in prehistoric Taiwan. Speaking of the conservatism of Taiwan's indigenous people, it can be clearly seen from this that external things have not had any influence on the island for thousands of years. While one side is advancing by leaps and bounds, the other side is still stagnant in the primitive era. The difference between the two can be measured in miles, which is truly the most mysterious miracle of the 20th century. In the area of raw barbarians today, many places still use stone tools. Some people say that this is the lovableness of the highland residents, but it is also their sorrow. I believe that even if the world goes forward for thousands of years, these highland residents will still live like this.

### Entire Page (3) From Weixian to Qingdao

— Special Correspondent Litian

Jinan Airmail Dispatch, 11th

On the 7th, at 7:30 AM, I boarded the same ordinary express train as yesterday to continue eastward. Upon boarding, I saw that the passengers were fewer than yesterday. Even in the third-class carriages, everyone had a seat. The train was originally scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM, but for some reason, it was delayed by twenty minutes before heading east. The water heaters in the carriages were not lit, and the northerners were shivering from the cold. At 9:00 AM, after the train passed Fangzi, the carriages gradually warmed up.

Fangzi is also one of the major stations along the route. South of the station is a coal mine producing over 200 tons of coal daily. Although the quantity is small and the quality is far inferior to Zibo, it played a crucial role when the railway west of Changle and east of Fangzi was damaged by the Communist forces last year. During the period when the area was heavily besieged, the Fangzi coal mine became the biggest source of power in the surrounded area.

At 11:00 AM, the train passed Nanliu, Huangqibao, Zoushan, and Taibaozhuang. The Yunhe Railway Bridge, 255.9 meters long between Nanliu and Gongtong, and the Yellow River Bridge, 292 meters long between Huangqibao and Zoushan (see photo), were both systematically destroyed by the Communist forces. According to engineers from the railway bureau, the Wei River Railway Bridge was damaged twice. The first time, the damage was minor and quickly repaired. The Communist forces then inflicted thorough destruction. The bridge has seven spans. The engineers also said that to repair the Wei River Railway Bridge, 30,000 sleepers alone would be needed. To restore it to its original state, the project would take until June of this year to complete. Currently, traffic is maintained by using the cold weather and low water levels to lay a temporary three-li-long road alongside the riverbed next to the bridge. However, if the water rises in summer and autumn, traffic will inevitably be affected.

Taibaozhuang and Kangjiazhuang have always been areas where the Communist forces appear unpredictably. It is said that in this region, less than thirty li south of the railway line is the Communist "Liberated Zone." Every night, the Communist forces come out to engage in sabotage. Therefore, the railway in this area was the last to be repaired, and the number of times it was damaged after being repaired was particularly high. Because the repair was the latest, when the entire line was reconnected on December 12th last year, Director Chen Shungeng personally arrived to hammer in the last commemorative road nail at the reconnecting point. The railway bureau also held a grand reconnection ceremony here. Therefore, the train's passage here, although it is a small station, doubles its historical significance, and all passengers are uneasy and particularly cautious. Currently, the military strength in this area has been increased, and defensive works are being strengthened. From Taibaozhuang eastward, all stations, besides a temporary one or two station buildings built for ticket sales and office use, are actually just piles of rubble. At 12:05 PM, the train stopped in an even larger pile of rubble. I got out of the carriage, stepped onto the station, and looked ahead. Broken walls and ruins were everywhere. Regardless of station buildings, warehouses, railway dormitories, schools, or shops, it was just rubble, and nothing could be distinguished. At that moment, my immediate feeling was like being in Guilin after a calamity. I couldn't tell where I was. Only when I looked back and saw two large square characters on the door of a temporary station building made of a one-and-a-half-section broken wall with a wooden board roof did I realize that I had arrived in Gaomi.

Many new passengers boarded at Gaomi Station. Involuntarily, I started asking about the situation on this route. One of them told the following story: several months ago, several thousand Communist soldiers intercepted a passenger train. They forced all passengers, regardless of gender, age, armed or unarmed, to get off the train and line up for inspection. After the inspection, they seemed to have found nothing. Then, the leader of the Communist forces began to lecture the passengers, explaining why the Communist forces wanted to destroy the railway, providing detailed explanations. After finishing, they ordered the passengers to re-board the train without committing any offenses. The train then departed, and the Communist forces marched away in formation. After this passenger finished speaking, another passenger described a completely opposite fact. According to him, in late December of last year, several hundred Communist soldiers were active between Caijiazhuang and Kangjiazhuang. A military train happened to pass by, and the Communist forces did not disturb it. However, when a passenger train came by, they suddenly planted a landmine, destroying seven carriages, killing and injuring over twenty passengers. Not satisfied with this, they proceeded to loot all the passengers' belongings and abduct many men and women. By the time the National Army arrived after hearing the news, the Communist forces had already disappeared.

As a reporter who had just arrived in this area, I really didn't understand the purpose of these two completely contradictory approaches of the Communist forces. After discussing and gathering the conclusions of four or five passengers present, their conclusion was that the former action of the Communist forces was merely a despicable means of deceiving our soldiers and civilians, and in reality, it was only an occasional act, while the latter was their true purpose: robbing trains and goods, taking advantage of the opportunity to profit. Residents on both sides of the railway, during the enemy's occupation, all had "protection villages" organized along the route, stipulating that a certain section of the road was the responsibility of a certain village. If there was any damage, the villagers would be subjected to the most severe punishment. Because the people couldn't bear the suffering, many moved elsewhere. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, under the control of the Communist forces, the people were forced to destroy the railway in various ways. After the railway was repaired, although there were no severe penalties, the railway was always being repaired after being damaged. So, they were the ones who destroyed the railway, and they were the ones who repaired the railway. They had no force; they could only obey. And most of the uneducated and kind people, although they didn't speak out, were still confused and didn't understand why the railway under the management of the Chinese themselves had to be destroyed, and they still couldn't figure out what it was for.

This situation, as a primary school teacher told me, requires the government and the political training personnel of the army to do more educational work. The people will not be fools forever. The people are now slowly realizing who is right and who is wrong, and which side the truth stands on. But if we must wait for the people to awaken automatically or learn lessons from painful experiences, then it would be too tragic and too cruel!

Along the way, on the walls in some places, I saw some slogans left over from the era of enemy puppets and the Communist forces' occupation. Although some slogans had been painted over, the old slogans were vaguely visible due to rain erosion. The former, such as "Assisting the Imperial Army is Self-Preservation," and the latter, such as "The Military and Civilians of the Liberated Zone Unite to Fight to the Death Against the Bandits." When these types of slogans are seen mixed together with the slogans posted by the Nationalist Army, it is not difficult to imagine the different encounters they had in the three different stages.

Mr. Li, a small clerk who was in charge of luggage on the train during the enemy puppet period, is still managing luggage now. He earns the lowest basic salary of thirty yuan a month. According to him, "During the enemy's occupation, the Communist forces also often destroyed the railway, but the extent and decisiveness were far inferior to the thoroughness and prevalence during the National Army's protection." A battalion commander Huang sitting opposite me blurted out, "This is called 'Outward Warfare, Incompetent; Inward Warfare, Competent,' 'Close Brothers, Careful Accounting.'" Everyone in the compartment was amused and speechless.

It was as if it were a temporary impromptu symposium that had formed in the train. The symposium ended here! The train had already glided past Jiaoxian, glided over the Dagu River Railway Bridge, Chengyang, and along the northeastern shore of the beautiful Jiaozhou Bay, entering Qingdao Station at 4:20 PM.

### Weekly Forum Weather and Flight Safety

— Huang Xiaqian

Councilor Yin Shuxian came to Shanghai to investigate the plane crash case and has already returned to Beijing after completing the task. He gave a talk to the press on the 17th, explaining that there are three main reasons for the recent plane crashes: (1) Inaccurate weather reports; (2) Poor ground equipment; (3) Numerous personnel malpractices. Although this matter has already passed, the issue of flight safety is still of concern to the world. The author specializes in aviation meteorology and would like to contribute the results of his usual research to the Chinese people for reference.

Since December 14th of last year, there have been as many as five civil aviation plane crashes in our country, one after another. The government was shocked, public opinion was in an uproar, and the families of the victims were even more aggrieved. It is truly an unprecedentedly serious event in China's aviation industry. Why did the planes crash? Will there be more in the future? Can it be prevented? At this time of learning from the past and seeking to prevent a recurrence, it is especially necessary to discuss it.

The causes of plane crashes can be broadly summarized into the following categories: (1) The aircraft itself. Aircraft are "heavier than air" flying machines. If the aircraft itself has defects, catches fire, or malfunctions, it can naturally crash and shatter. In fact, the sophistication of aircraft structure and the careful selection of materials are far beyond what land and sea transportation can achieve. Under the principle of stable flight, it is not easy for accidents to occur. As for fire, it is often the result of the aircraft crashing on the ground and the fuel tank leaking. Fires in the air are rare. When they do occur, they are very dangerous, but there is still a chance to save the situation. If there is an airfield nearby, the entire plane may not be destroyed. The Far Eastern Airlines' "Miss Luzon" that crashed in the South China Sea (January 11th) was due to the number two engine catching fire. The pilot immediately landed the plane on the sea surface, and most of the passengers were rescued (only six out of thirty-six people were missing), which can be taken as an example. Furthermore, the failure of mechanical parts does not necessarily lead to the complete sacrifice of the entire aircraft. In the United States, several tests have been conducted to stop half of the aircraft's engines, and the aircraft can still continue to fly, but the speed is halved. Finally, when all the engines are stopped, it can still glide for dozens of miles before landing safely, like a glider. It can be seen that obstacles in the aircraft's mechanical parts are not a major harm. If there is an airfield within a hundred miles, there is nothing to worry about. However, if it is a long-distance flight and there are few airfields, there will inevitably be some danger, but it is not entirely hopeless. Therefore, in theory, the aircraft itself may be one of the causes of accidents, but in reality, it is not important. Throughout history, there have been few aircraft crashes that have been definitively determined to be due to the aircraft itself, which can serve as clear evidence.

(2) The pilot. If the pilot's skills are poor, or if they are occasionally careless, or if they are too adventurous, or for other complex reasons, it may naturally cause all kinds of tragedies. However, the last three are difficult to judge and difficult to restrict in advance. There is no other way but to discuss from the perspective of technical standards. In the United States, commercial aircraft pilots, because they are responsible for the safety of all passengers on board, have very strict qualification restrictions. Generally, they must have 2,000 hours of flying experience to be eligible. If they have this experience, they can cope with ease and will not easily have accidents. It is not known how the qualifications of commercial aircraft pilots are stipulated in our country, which deserves our attention.

(3) The airport. The causes of plane crashes attributed to airports can be further divided into several categories: First, the airport environment is poor, such as the Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon, which is surrounded by high mountains. In the past, a plane crashed into the top of a mountain after taking off. By extension, high obstacles near the airport can also be harmful to flight. In the past, a plane in Shanghai crashed into a ship's mast, and a plane in New York crashed into a skyscraper, both of which belong to this category. Second, the size of the airport and the runway are too short. If the pilot is careless during takeoff and landing, the plane will run off the runway and crash, which is unfavorable for large aircraft. During the Anti-Japanese War, a Super Fortress bomber landed and then took off from the Chongqing Coral Airport, which was hailed as a miracle in the aviation industry. Today's C-46 four-engine jumbo jet is about the same size as the Super Fortress bomber. If it takes off and lands at an airport that is too small, it will be difficult and prone to accidents. Third, the runway construction is poor. If the aircraft wheels sink into a depression, there is a risk of overturning and destruction. Fourth, the airport equipment is incomplete, such as the lack of blind landing equipment, and allowing the plane to land blindly will naturally lead to accidents. The public can see and pay attention to the above factors, so there are not many plane crashes caused by these factors.

(4) Weather. Weather is the general term for the conditions of the atmosphere in a short period of time. Cold, warm, dry, humid, wind, snow, thunder, lightning, rain, fog, hail, and visibility, which indicates clarity, are all factors. Among them, the following are most likely to cause plane crashes (detailed discussions can be found in the author's Aviation Meteorology published by Commercial Press): First, fog. Fog can obstruct vision. In the most serious cases, objects beyond three meters cannot be seen. Cars driving in it can hardly avoid collisions. It is impossible for a plane to find the airport and identify the runway from the sky. Even with lighter fog, objects beyond ten meters are still invisible. The speed of the plane is very high, usually more than eighty meters per second. In other words, if an obstacle is found beyond eighty meters, it will arrive at the current location in less than a second. How can it avoid it? This is why planes are so prone to accidents in fog. The China National Aviation Corporation plane that crashed in Qingdao on the 5th of this month belongs to this category. At present, the world's aviation industry regards fog as a major obstacle to flight and is seeking solutions, but there is still no proper solution. Even with the "Fido" defogging method, the United States has not adopted it on a large scale, and it is even more difficult to implement in our country due to the lack of gasoline. The so-called radio-guided landing equipment can only be used in "high fog." Very serious low fog is still difficult to handle. Fortunately, fog is predictable. As long as the flight time is not absolutely unchangeable, it can be landed after the fog clears according to the instructions of the meteorologists. It is winter now, and fog is very likely to occur in the morning after rain and sunny days, and it is also very likely to disappear. If the plane that crashed in Qingdao on the 5th of this month had been delayed by three hours (the crashed plane arrived in the airspace above Qingdao at 7:15 AM), it is believed that the fog would have disappeared, and the plane would have been spared the tragedy. Second, low clouds. When the cloud base is less than thirty meters above the ground, it is called "ceiling zero" in aviation meteorology, which is very likely to cause plane crashes. When the plane has not emerged from the clouds, it does not know where the airport is. After emerging from the clouds, it is too close to the ground. If there are obstacles, it is too late to avoid them, especially in areas with undulating mountains. The plane that General Dai Li was on crashed into a mountain and burned near Nanjing last spring belongs to this category. To prevent this type of accident in aviation, it is only possible to follow the instructions of the meteorologists. The weather report has a "ceiling" item, which is the height of the cloud base above the ground. Knowing the height of the cloud base above the ground and knowing the height of the mountain peaks along the way, flying above the height of the mountain peaks can avoid touching the mountain peaks and causing a catastrophe. Also, in aviation meteorology, "ceiling zero" is routinely accompanied by a warning to stop flying. If the warning is followed, there will be no tragedy. Third, poor visibility. Unclear visibility in the atmosphere has various causes besides fog, collectively referred to as poor visibility. One of the causes is the arrival of a weather phenomenon called "warm front." The clouds are low and it is drizzling. Looking up, the "ceiling" is zero. Looking ahead, the road cannot be distinguished. Landing a plane in it is similar to driving a car in the dark, where accidents can happen anywhere. Also, when it is snowing, the snow is an opaque substance. When it is dancing like hungry hair, even if the airport has blind landing equipment, accidents can still occur. Fortunately, meteorologists will definitely give special warnings when they find this type of weather. Responding according to the warning can also avoid accidents. Fourth, thunderstorms. The air in a thunderstorm moves up and down. When it is strong, it can cause the plane to lose control, leading to a tragedy. In September 1941, a cargo plane in our country carrying 50 million yuan in cash from Hong Kong to Chongqing crashed in a thunderstorm near Hengyang, destroying the plane and killing the people on board. A "Clipper" on the Pacific Ocean was caught in a thunderstorm and carried to an altitude of over 10,000 feet by the ascending airflow. It was then suddenly pressed down by the airflow to almost the sea surface. During the up and down movement, the passengers in the plane all detached from their seats and floated in the air. It can be seen that the up and down movement of the airflow inside a thunderstorm is violent. It is only bound to fail when trying to fight. Fortunately, meteorologists often forewarn the presence of thunderstorms, which can be prevented in advance and avoid accidents. Fifth, aircraft icing. From the ground up, the higher the altitude, the colder it is. In winter, the ground temperature is already close to freezing, and the temperature will be even lower when the plane is flying above. Clouds are formed by the accumulation of ice droplets. Low and thick clouds are particularly rich in water. When the plane enters it, ice will attach to the wings and fuselage, which is called "aircraft icing," which can also be harmful to flight and even lead to accidents. A China National Aviation Corporation plane crashed in Dangyang last spring due to this. Although none of the five recently crashed planes were caused by icing, in aviation history, it is not uncommon for planes to crash due to icing. It is winter now, the time when aircraft icing is most likely to occur. It is hoped that the airline companies will pay attention to it early to avoid adding another accident to the record. As for the points to pay attention to, for the aircraft itself, aircraft flying to colder regions should have de-icing devices. However, if severe situations are encountered, the de-icing device may sometimes fail. To ensure safety, it is still necessary to pay attention to the weather. Meteorologists can point out the dangers of icing in the weather and can also provide methods to avoid it. The only question is whether the flight personnel can follow the instructions.

The various causes of plane crashes mentioned above clearly show that weather is the most important. In reality, plane crashes often occur under so-called adverse weather conditions. Winter is the season with the most adverse weather in a year, and tragic plane crashes occur one after another. Conversely, in the daytime, under windless and stable weather conditions, the aviation industry is often calm and uneventful, which can further prove that plane crashes are due to weather. To investigate the past to clarify responsibility, or to mend the fold after a loss, and plan to prevent it, the path is clear. Because most of the plane crashes in the United States have been due to weather, they have paid attention to weather to prevent accidents. All airports have meteorologists who specialize in weather observation and forecasting. The dispatcher of the airport is staffed by a meteorologist. Before departure, the pilot must read the weather map and listen to the meteorologist's explanation and instructions on the current weather. In recent years, it has been considered more important to pay attention to aviation than to pay attention to agriculture, so the Weather Bureau was transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Commerce. According to reports, our Civil Aviation Administration has the idea of strictly managing aviation and improving meteorological standards. The fundamental plan is essential. However, it is not known how to manage and how to improve meteorological standards, which is worth discussing. If the Ministry of Communications or the Civil Aviation Administration itself has no one who pays attention to the weather and does not handle or control civil meteorological services, but only formulates regulations such as "fly in good weather and do not fly in bad weather," then the good and bad standards may differ due to different viewpoints, and who will be responsible for determining the weather standard at all times? After a long time, it may still be equal to a piece of paper. It is better for the Ministry of Communications or the Civil Aviation Administration to be solely responsible for controlling civil meteorological services to coordinate with aviation operations. Fortunately, our country also has a Meteorological Bureau, which currently belongs to the Ministry of Education. Its business is to collect climate data for research, which is even more remote than the Meteorological Bureau of the Department of Agriculture in the United States. Timely transfer of affiliation may reduce some accidents for future aircraft? 3

### Alleviating Urgency

— Editor

Generally, businesses need to allocate funds every morning to cope with urgent matters. At the end of the year, they have to try their best to get through the difficult times, which is also to cope with urgent matters. When there is no way out, applying for production loans is also to cope with urgent matters.

Because every day, every month, and even every year, there are urgent matters to deal with, there is no time to deal with other matters that can be slightly delayed!

However, the reason why an urgent situation is formed is often because matters that can be delayed cannot be completed on time, so it is necessary to find ways to deal with it temporarily. Therefore, if matters that can be delayed are not handled one day, urgent matters will always be urgent.

In general, people seem to think that matters related to personnel management can be slightly delayed. It also seems that employee training, the cultivation of service ethics, and the promotion of work efficiency can be slightly delayed. However, as a result, the organization cannot be sound, affairs cannot proceed smoothly, and sales cannot be expanded. As a result, the economy cannot be managed, and it becomes more and more urgent day and night, so that there is no day that is not urgent, no month that is not urgent, and no year that is not urgent!

At the same time, in the general situation of society, there are also many matters that can be delayed that need to be done. For example, the "Love the Country, Use Domestic Goods" movement requires a considerable amount of time to be effective. If we can recall that when foreign goods first came, people generally refused to try them. However, over time, to change the mentality of loving foreign goods, or even taking pride in loving foreign goods, will not be achieved overnight. However, if this matter that seems to be able to be slightly delayed is procrastinated and not promoted, it will never succeed. If matters that can be delayed are not handled, urgent matters will inevitably arise in the future.

For the sake of future planning, businesses should really advance both urgent and delayed matters, and take overall consideration.

### A Brief Discussion of Scientific Management

— Xue Peng

Anyone who pursues industry must adapt to the times to study the two matters of division of labor and delivery. Machines have replaced manual labor, so industry is flourishing; because delivery is becoming faster, the methods of trading are also gradually changing. The methods of management and administration also have to change with each passing day.

Scientific industrial management is the experience gained through precise investigation, not following old practices. Managers should first analyze their industry in detail, think it over again and again, and implement the best possible methods. It is not a reckless decision, but the result of careful research. After obtaining the right method, one can then stipulate the rules for working and categorize them, guiding employees with earnestness and patience to act according to the prescribed methods.

The essence of scientific management and the methods specifically applied to factory management are entirely based on psychological decisions. The problem of employing people in a factory requires not only specifying how much work a worker should do each day but also determining the daily duties of each department manager, shop assistant, errand runner, and sales manager. The most important thing is how to induce them to do their duty and achieve the effect of daily work. This is where the significance of scientific management arises. Studying scientific factory management can give one a sense of commercial operating psychology, which is the most important thing. Success or failure in business entirely depends on the sensitivity of psychological perception, which enables people in economic factories to develop their own special management methods, and then use experimental efforts to determine the secret to convenient and most effective work. Therefore, every business regards psychological agility as the only way to develop.

People who are good at using psychology to manage factories do not complain about high delivery costs or workers' wages, or add machines. On the contrary, they study the installation of the machines to see if there are any inconveniences, and whether the workers are doing the work they should be doing in a day, and then guide them earnestly. If the sales costs are high, they investigate the shop assistants and salespersons, how they sell their goods, and whether the sales procedures comply with the prescribed methods, and then reorganize and improve them. Without increasing the price of the product or reducing the wages of the hired workers, operating the factory in this way will surely generate profits, and the workers will surely receive high wages. Customers will also be able to get cheap goods. The concept of reducing delivery costs, increasing wages, and selling cheap goods all comes from the study of scientific management methods. Therefore, the essence of scientific management is not to reduce the materials of goods, but to produce the best goods with the least raw materials, and not to increase the working hours of workers, but to improve the unnecessary movements of workers, so that every action can achieve practical results. It is not about raising the price of goods, but about reducing consumption to obtain profits.

Establishing Rules and Implementing Them Strictly

If the rules are not practical, then they lose their value. Therefore, the standards and methods have no special advantages, but are only to make the established rules practical and to reduce superficial rules and increase precise regulations to seek common application. Even if matters are trivial, they can be analyzed by common articles, and their function is like this. Now, let us analyze the management elements as follows:

(1) Investigating bad habits and studying improvement methods is the special duty of managers. No matter where they are, they should carefully investigate and eliminate bad practices. What is particularly urgent to study is how to save time, save labor, increase production, and pay attention to what is costly and superficial, and what should be saved, to seek the best method and use it for work. If it is legal, it should always be regarded as a standard, and if it is dirty work, it should be carried out according to law, and the results will naturally improve day by day.

(2) Implementing the standard is to make it effective. Therefore, it is necessary to have a specially established organization to take charge of it. This organization is the so-called planning department. The planning department occupies the most important position in the factory, stipulating the daily delivery of each worker and the materials to be used, so that they have the ability to make their own decisions. It also sets up technicians to teach various mechanical functions, so that they can have a wonderful application at hand. Not only that, but it must also gather the strength of the group to achieve results. Every day, it is necessary to strictly examine the production performance of each worker, check whether the stipulated rules and methods can be followed, and whether they are effective, and seek methods to remedy the deficiencies and correct the deviations, and must reach the perfect month before stopping.

(3) Train the craftsmen to obey the company's articles of association, and fulfill their obligations and carry out their work in accordance with the established rules.

(4) Inspire enthusiasm for work. It is necessary to provide considerable funds to reward craftsmen with excellent performance and skilled technicians with deep qualifications.

(5) Recruit experts in factory management and study precise methods. Make management put into practice according to scientific ideals. All matters are complete and carried out year by year to form a permanent system.

Investigate the Actual Situation and Prepare for Improvement

Investigation is a major task in the factory, and its scope is also very large. From reviewing and planning to improving, from improving to perfecting, the greatness of the effect cannot be limited, but to start the investigation, all kinds of malpractices are also very trivial and troublesome. However, a researcher with scientific knowledge will be able to handle it with ease. The initial investigation is to study the time of each movement and stop, each rise and fall of each machine, and use a stopwatch to obtain an accurate comparison. Then, make a work schedule and implement it accordingly, so that the time of the day will not be wasted at all. The resulting items are more than double what they were before, and sometimes even more than doubled. From this point of view, the factory investigation cannot be ignored. However, the investigation also has its loopholes. For example, the store does not have any records of the talent and behavior of the partners, and the accountant can use his skills to enter and exit with private intentions. The progress of store affairs is thus ruined. Even so, the function of the investigation is not only to save labor and materials, but also to increase business profits. Therefore, the investigation should adopt proper and applicable methods and proceed step by step. This is the first step in organizing the factory. The second step is to use scientific thinking to review and determine progressive methods to show the standards for the future. For example, in the machine field, all the machines that are continuous in action are also adjacent to each other. Then, the action is continuous and uninterrupted, and the time for the craftsman to walk around, as well as the manpower for handling, can also be reduced.

The standard method must be persistent and patient to be effective. Therefore, perseverance is the only standard for those who are in charge of the factory, and the standard method cannot be achieved overnight.

Business Smoothly Requires Further Research

The key to seeking standard methods is to facilitate supply and demand and agility in operation. The entry point is nothing more than analyzing various affairs, examining them in detail, and studying their advantages and disadvantages. In the era of business development, poor management certainly has any obstacles, but when goods are short or when competing with the same industry, the exhausted form will immediately appear. By that time, it will cost a very high price to restore business. Therefore, seeking a standard business must be at the time of prosperous business, not after the defeat is revealed.

Implementation of Personnel Management

(II) Testing (Continued)

D. Physical examination. Physical examination is beneficial in many ways. First, it can ensure that the employed staff have sound physical fitness. Secondly, it can extend the working hours of the staff (because they have a sound physical fitness). Thirdly, because various business organizations implement physical examinations when employing staff, it can also cultivate the habit of protecting their health. The form used by Edison Company for physical examinations includes the following points: 1. Height 2. Weight 3. Weight below the feet or exceeding the standard 4. Sunlight 5 Heart - blood pressure 6. Lungs - whether there are any diseases 7. Teeth 8. Ears 9. Appearance - strong, weak, anemic 10. Do you often have headaches? 11. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or take other stimulants? 12. Nose - is the respiratory system healthy? 13. Is the nervous system healthy? 14. Is sleep sound? 15. Do you have any venereal diseases? On the top of this form, there are records of the number, date, applicant's name, male or female, married or unmarried? etc. Below, there are the signatures of the doctor in charge of the examination and the supervisors who approved the employment.

This kind of physical examination record can also be put together with the survey form for future reference. In larger organizations, there are often fixed doctors who can be assigned to the work of examining the crotch. If the staff have diseases, the doctor can provide free diagnosis and treatment, which is also a very beneficial welfare work for the staff.

(III) Employment

After the above work, if the applicant is qualified, then he can be hired. When hiring, it is best to prepare a notice. The personnel department prepares three copies, one for the employee who is hired, one for the work department, and one for the personnel department to keep. The format can be referred to the following (the original form is changed to vertical arrangement and slightly simplified.)

Employee Employment Notice (Number)

... Department Taizhao (Year/Month/Day)

Name Age

Position

Monthly Salary

... Personnel Department Signature

When each department needs to add new staff, it can also use the form of a notice to inform the personnel department of the work to be done, the age limit, etc. After the personnel department receives the notice, it can handle the necessary matters after the approval of the competent authority.

### The Cultivation and Attainment of Literary Artists

— Zhang Daofan

The universe and life are originally inseparable, and knowledge and action are originally one thing. This is the Chinese principle of the unity of heaven and man and the consistency of knowledge and action. Therefore, human activities are the evolution of the universe, and the expansion of knowledge depends entirely on human efforts. Therefore, the Book of Changes says, "The movement of heaven is strong; a gentleman strengthens himself unceasingly." In this universe, where there is no day of perfection, mankind can only obtain the meaning and value of life through constant effort and creation. The Western philosopher Bergson also said: "All phenomena in the universe are constituted by the flow of human consciousness. Birth and death are the results of human free consciousness." Human beings constantly create and constantly evolve. The flow of consciousness is called spiritual life, which must be sought through introspection and intuition. Since we know that change and flow are the interaction between heaven and man, we must know that the power of change and flow is in our own hands. If we have this mind and this understanding, then we can have a perfect outlook on life and a rich life interest, which is the source of the cultivation of first-class literary artists and the birthplace of first-class works. From this understanding, followed by experience, life in this endless universe, although like an ephemera shadow dew, has the merit of participating in the creation of education, and has an inescapable responsibility. Zengzi said: "A scholar cannot but be broad and resolute, for his burden is heavy and his course is long. He takes benevolence as his own task; is it not heavy? He ceases only with death; is it not long?" When life has this spiritual life, it is a state of contentment wherever one goes. One is not bound by emotions to external things, nor is one's joy or sorrow affected by gains or losses. What is expressed outwardly is gentle and generous, and what is contained inwardly is pure and noble. One is not enslaved by the myriad things before one's eyes, nor is one limited by knowledge and methods. This is the unique genius of literary artists. Those who appreciate the scenery and enjoy the moon and wind are inferior.

Life has three aspects: knowledge, emotion, and will. To achieve the integration of knowledge, emotion, and will in the realm of truth, goodness, and beauty is also the necessary cultivation and the highest attainment of literary artists. "Gentlemen use literature to make friends, and use friends to assist benevolence" is the only way to achieve this kind of cultivation and attainment. Human beings cannot exist alone. Benevolence is the pairing of people. If people do not pair with each other, then the concept of benevolence cannot be established. Therefore, the training of knowledge, emotion, and will, and the cultivation of personal character, cannot be successful by relying solely on oneself. If there were no people in the world, how could my personality be expressed? Or if the world were full of sin, how could my personality be sound? Therefore, personality is common, not lonely; to make one's own personality upward, the personality of the masses must be upward; to make the personality of the masses the same, one must make one's own personality upward. Understanding this kind of lifting of strength and environment is the evolutionary principle of making friends with literature and assisting benevolence with friends. The knowledge, emotion, and will of the masses can all be reached in the realm of truth, goodness, and beauty through Tao Shu and observation; then the individual will be no exception. Therefore, Confucius taught people, "If you want to establish yourself, establish others; if you want to reach yourself, reach others." To establish and reach oneself is to establish and reach others; to establish and reach others is to establish and reach oneself. To experience the two words of establishment and reach is to be the "way of benevolence." If you understand benevolence, the realm of truth, goodness, and beauty will naturally arrive.

The National Association of Literary and Art Writers is a place to make friends with literature and assist benevolence with friends, so that we can get the opportunity to strengthen ourselves unceasingly, observe, and cultivate. We must cultivate a common and wonderful outlook on life, and have a consistent understanding of the unity of knowledge and action. Only then can the cultivation and attainment of a literary artist be completed. Confucius said: "People can promote the Way, not the Way promotes people," which is worthy of our repeated contemplation.

### Talking About Literary Movement——In Commemoration of the First Anniversary of the All-China Writers Association

— Lao Xiang

Literary art, from a historical perspective, originally has a natural movement track. This natural track is the cycle of urban and rural areas, and the exchange of elegance and vulgarity. That is, folk literary art should enter the city, and urban literary art should go to the countryside. The literary movement should be the strengthening of this kind of exchange or cycle.

"The source of all new literature is in the folk." The standpoint of saying this sentence is in the city. Folk literary art can enter the city due to the needs of both urban and rural areas:

First, folk artists need to enter the city. The traditional concept of folk artists is particularly strong, "Learning literature and martial arts, selling to the emperor's family." People in the city are rich and have leisure time, and they also have a great temptation for folk artists. Therefore, folk literary art is brought into the city by folk artists.

Second, the needs of urban literati. They always need new literary forms, new styles, new vocabularies, new stories, new interests, and even more real grief, real emotions, and real social situations. These are exactly the characteristics of folk literary art, which can just meet the needs of literati. As the saying goes, "If there is someone who buys, there must be someone who sells." When a relationship of demand and supply arises between urban and rural areas, folk literary art will naturally flow into the city.

Third, the needs of the government. In ancient times, there were special officials who collected poems, "The king observes customs and knows gains and losses, and examines and corrects himself." There were also envoys who collected novels, "Those who work want to know the customs of the people, so they set up petty officials to speak." This is a need for political education. In addition, there is also a need for entertainment. For example, "speaking" was only popular among the people in the Tang Dynasty. "During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, the country heard about leisure and wanted to advance a strange thing every day to entertain it." Therefore, the novel storybook also entered the city.

After folk literary art enters the city, it may have two results after being appreciated and imitated by literati: one is temple literary art that loses its spirit and only retains its shell, and the other is vigorous literary art that is sent back to the countryside. This kind of literary art can be sent to the countryside because of the needs of both urban and rural areas.

First, the needs of literati in the city. They want to expand the effect of literary art and expand the scope of readers, so as to satisfy the desire for creation. They cannot but strive to be close to the majority of the people, and they cannot but understand the likes and dislikes of the people. Naturally, they cannot but strive for popularity. This kind of popular literary art that has been painstakingly trained by literati is the main component of Chinese literary history.

Second, the needs of folk artists. They want to strive for personal reputation and take pride in making friends with literati, and strive for elegance. Therefore, they try their best to search for the works of literati and send them to the countryside. A prostitute in the Tang Dynasty who could recite Bai Xueshi's "Song of Everlasting Sorrow" could raise her reputation and be proud of her peers. This is an excellent example.

On the one hand, they want to enter the city, and on the other hand, they want to go to the countryside, which naturally creates a cycle. Folk literary art has sand and gold, and cannot all be elegant. Urban literary art has old and new, and cannot all be sent to the countryside. However, what is moving on this cycle track is fresh and lively literary art, which is fresh blood for cultivating culture.

The literary movement should focus on breaking the state of urban and rural literary art that travels in a single direction and never intersects. It should follow the natural track of upward and downward exchanges, consciously extract the essence of folk literary art, and consciously create literary art for the folk.

### The So-Called "Perfect Man"——A Tribute to the Annual Meeting of the All-China Literary and Art Writers Association

— Chen Zhifo

The ideal of life in the Renaissance was "perfect man." The so-called perfect man is someone who can develop human nature as much as possible in many aspects. Human nature originally has a "truth" requirement, a "good" requirement, and also a "beauty" requirement. The complete life is the average development of these three: truth, goodness, and beauty. What is called truth, what is called goodness, and what is called beauty? Mr. Zhu Guangqian said in his "Talking About Beauty": "The practical attitude takes goodness as the highest purpose, the scientific attitude takes truth as the highest purpose, and the aesthetic attitude takes beauty as the highest purpose. In the practical attitude, our attention is biased towards the interests of things to people, and the psychological activity focuses on the will; in the scientific attitude, our attention is biased towards the interrelationships between things, and the psychological activity focuses on abstract thinking; in the aesthetic attitude, our attention is focused on the form of things themselves, and the psychological activity focuses on intuition." Here, it can be understood that truth is rational, goodness is volitional, and beauty is emotional. Although the three are different, they are by no means mutually contradictory for life. The opposite of truth is falsehood, the opposite of goodness is evil, and the opposite of beauty is ugliness. If a person has one of the three: falsehood, evil, and ugliness, it is obvious that there is a defect in his personality. From this, it can be known that the three: truth, goodness, and beauty are not only not contradictory to life, but are also whole and inseparable. Being a person is the same as writing poems, essays, painting, etc. A good poem, a beautiful essay, and a masterpiece all have their integrity——life; a complete personality is also the same. A poem cannot be said to be a good poem just because it has one or two good lines; an essay cannot be said to be a good essay just because it has a few witty remarks; a painting cannot be said to be a good painting just because it has a few wonderful strokes. It is just like a person, it cannot be said that a person is good just because he has a little merit. A mere partial masterpiece is not a perfect work, because it lacks the life of the work. If truth, goodness, and beauty are not completely integrated into life, but only partially developed, then it cannot be called a perfect life. Because life is circulating throughout the entire body, it is definitely not hidden in each part.

### Literary Writing of Tomorrow

— Gao Zhi

To put it bluntly, Chinese new literary writing, except for the words, inherits the traditions of Western literature in all aspects. However, our new literary writing will not have the prosperity of Western literature in the next twenty years, just as our material construction will not catch up with Europe and the United States in twenty or thirty years. Because although new literary writing largely inherits the traditions of Western literature, it does not have the objective environment of Western literary writing.

For example, in the United States and Britain, literary writing, and therefore the lives of writers, are supported by society, that is, by readers buying works. In the Soviet Union, literary writing, and therefore the lives of writers, are presided over by the government. Or, in the United States, the medium between the author and the reader is private publishing institutions, while in the Soviet Union, this medium is national publishing institutions. The situation in China is between these two extremes. Leaving aside other factors, the high percentage of illiteracy in China and the low purchasing power of readers are enough to make literary writing very difficult. It is possible for our writers to write a few good works in twenty or thirty years, and it is even possible now. But to have a prosperity like other countries, with my personal short-sighted eyes, I cannot see when it will be possible.

Literary writing of tomorrow will definitely be more prosperous and have better achievements than today. Even though I am short-sighted, I can still see this clearly. However, I am not sure whether this tomorrow is within ten years or after ten years. And I can't guess. First, it depends on how the two basic prerequisites are, that is, it depends on the situation of education popularization and improvement in the future, as well as the situation of industrialization and economic construction. In addition to these two points and other factors, the efforts of writers are of course the most important.

As a reader, I hope that our new literature, like scientific research and economic construction, can catch up with or even surpass the achievements of other countries.

### Introducing the "Writers Association"

— Yang Qunfen

The Anti-Japanese War was won, but the work of nation-building after the Anti-Japanese War, or its hardship, was even more difficult than the Anti-Japanese War. This was the calm view of most people when Japan surrendered in August of the 34th year. Naturally, everyone should regroup and prepare to meet before the start of nation-building. Therefore, the pure literary and art writers gathered in Chongqing, with the enthusiastic response of writers from other provinces and cities across the country, began to plan and record the "All-China Literary and Art Writers Association" (referred to as the Writers Association), and in view of the fact that previous literary and art organizations focused on literature and missed artists, musicians, etc., they broke the narrow interpretation of the term "literary art" and integrated writers, painters, and composers into one, so that all workers in these sister departments could join hands to work hard for the great cause of nation-building.

The "Writers Association's" attitude and spirit of firmly committing to the task of nation-building can be proved from its organizational origin and founding declaration. The origin says: "The arrival of victory is the beginning of nation-building, and nation-building is more difficult than the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, at the beginning of this new era, we have to re-recognize our goals, go to our posts, and concentrate our strength to complete the greater cause of nation-building." The declaration says: "The strength, weakness, prosperity, and decline of a country are greatly influenced by its cultural superiority. Literary art is an important department of culture. Although the work of nation-building in the future is vast and complicated, it is an essential plan to promote national culture with literary art and enrich the strength of nation-building. We hope that literary and art writers across the country will recognize this point and strive to create literary art for nation-building." Therefore, if the "Writers Association" is worthy of social attention, the first is its call to create the era significance of literary art for nation-building.

The "Writers Association" is a literary and art organization that lives up to its name. Although members have different political ideas, and although there are prominent figures in the government, in this circle, they are all working hard to improve the level of Chinese literary art. At a time when domestic ideas are divergent, and insidious spies are ambitious and are always trying to subvert the foundation of our country and nation, the "Writers Association," in addition to refusing the participation of traitors, warmly welcomes writers across the country to actively join. Now there are already more than 300 writers who have joined, although there are slight restrictions on works and art productions. Almost all of them are very accomplished writers, and their names are very familiar to society.

However, counting up, including so many famous writers, the society's understanding of it in the past year may not be deep enough. The "Writers Association" is such a silent group that is pioneering the future of Chinese literary art. It does not create new ideas or borrow political events to sensationalize society, nor does it ask society to give anything. However, in the past year, it has established a branch in Peiping, a branch in Wuhan, and several other branches are in preparation. In the past year, the Nanjing Society's journal "Literary and Art Vanguard," the Peiping Society's journal "Literary and Art and Life," and the Literary and Art Series have continued to be published. In the past year, a grand evening party was held in Chongqing, a summer literary and art lecture was held in Nanjing, and several literary and art evenings were held in Peiping, and a literary and art salon was set up. People who do not know the "Writers Association" naturally do not believe these achievements. People who know it are probably even more unable to believe it, because it is an organization without funding.

The "Writers Association" will step into its second year from today. Congratulations on its being healthier.

### Arts and Friendship

— Xu Zhongnian

Congratulations to the "All China Federation of Literary and Art Circles"

This is no longer the era of "writers despising each other"; in the literary and artistic world, "thinking oneself unique" is almost impossible. I say "almost" to be cautious; to put it bluntly, the literary and artistic world will never tolerate "literary autocracy" in the future - if anyone has such delusions, we can only laugh it off!

Art is a broad avenue. Whoever is willing to work hard can go further; whoever is unwilling to work hard will fall behind. On this avenue, one can walk alone or advance as a group; advancing as a group seems more lively. If one is unwilling to work hard but is jealous of others' progress, even wanting to block the way and demand a toll, perhaps one can "temporarily" hinder the progress of a few, but in the end, it will be all in vain. This is because the avenue of art is too wide; if you block it here, others will go from there. The one not advancing is not others, but yourself!

Since it is named the "Republic of China Literary and Art Writers Association": "National" and "Association" are clearly visible. Therefore, "friendship" is the only condition. I sincerely pray that "authors," "authors," the key is in "authoring": In this year of the 36th Republic of China, all members of the association must distinguish themselves through their works - wealth and glory are fleeting clouds, all nonsense!

### Biography of Flandrin

(H. Flandrin 1809-1864) was the tail end of the classical school. Throughout his life, he followed Ingres, faithfully accepting the teachings of his teacher. Apart from some decorative murals painted for churches in his later years, most of his works are titled "Studies." His humble and faithful attitude is truly admirable. (Lion)

### Greetings to the "Writers' Association" Annual Meeting

— Wang Jinshan

I remember last year in Chongqing, when the All China Federation of Literary and Art Workers Association was established, I wrote a short article, the gist of which was: the establishment of the Writers' Association is not to establish a separate entity or form a clique; on the contrary, it shows that the literary and artistic world has achieved further unity; Chinese writers, who have never had guarantees or close ties, have thus established their own guarantees and connections. Although all are inevitably writers in dire straits, they may as well comfort each other with breath and moisten each other with saliva.

However, in the past year, due to the various difficulties of repatriation and post-repatriation, which could not be overcome for a time, coupled with the political and social turmoil and the sluggishness of the publishing industry, the reflection on the writers' side can be said to be a state of depression. It is undeniable that the Writers' Association has not seen any significant achievements in the past year. However, I believe that writers in general are gritting their teeth, enduring the material hardships after the war, and still struggling, absorbing, and conceiving in real life with the fighting spirit of the past eight years, preparing to greet the new era after the great era with great new works. The Writers' Association is also suitable to hold an annual meeting today after this year, and it is the beginning of the new year. In reviewing the past, planning the future, and getting rid of the old and bringing in the new, there will inevitably be significant gains, which can be wished in advance.

Looking back at the wartime, the writers all showed concentrated will, were faithful to their duties, and bravely exchanged literary and artistic achievements from the real life of the war. Creation itself has long become an inseparable heroic cause from national liberation, national construction, and people's livelihood. Then, how to preserve this achievement and how to carry forward this cause is undoubtedly the responsibility of the "Writers' Association" and the responsibility of writers all over the country.

As for this publication, the garden is completely open. Although the space is small, it is a purely literary and art supplement that appears in the daily newspaper every day. Today, I would like to take the opportunity, in the name of the editor, to add a sentence, willing to provide this publication openly to writers all over the country as a garden for exchanging opinions and publishing works. We also welcome the "Writers' Association" to give more guidance and assistance.

### Expand Grassroots Work, Commemorate the "Writers' Association" Anniversary

— Wang Rui

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, literary and art circles in Chongqing felt that the future task of literary and art writers should be based on the concept of "national supremacy and national supremacy" to engage in national construction work. On the one hand, they put forward the slogan of "national construction literature and art," and on the other hand, in view of the arduousness of the task, they contacted literary and art writers with common understanding and common goals to organize the All China Federation of Literary and Art Writers Association. After several months of preparation, the founding conference was held in the capital's cultural hall on January 26, 35th year of the Republic.

I remember that at the time, the leaders of the "Writers' Association," in addition to proclaiming the great plan of national construction literature and art when the founding conference was held, stated that the members of the "Writers' Association" should include literary and art writers, dramatists, and artists; in order to thoroughly implement the tasks of the "Writers' Association" to recommend excellent creations and protect the rights and interests of writers, it is necessary to start with strengthening the organization and connecting the feelings of members. After the establishment of the "Writers' Association," in addition to recruiting members and promoting the establishment of Writers' Association branches in various places, members' friendship evenings were often held in Chongqing.

On the occasion of the anniversary of the "Writers' Association," we reflect on ourselves. The organization of the Writers' Association needs to be strengthened, and the work of the Writers' Association itself is not enough. The reason is that the National Government returned to the capital, and comrades who originally worked together went to various parts of the country with this major change, each pursuing their own future. For example, the writer, who originally worked in the general association, changed his workplace to Shanghai after returning to the capital. This time, the "Writers' Association" held an annual meeting in Nanjing, which I was unable to attend due to my duties.

Fortunately, a literary and art lounge club has recently been established at No. 27, Tanggu Road, Luguang Road in Shanghai. The host was originally the initiator of the Writers Association. The two are spiritually, stylistically and ideologically related. Members of the Writers Association in Shanghai can use this club as a place for gatherings and exchanges. As long as everyone works together, it is possible to organize a Shanghai branch of the Writers Association.

The main business of the Literary and Art Lounge Club is literary and art seminars, art exhibitions, work appraisals, music appreciation, book and newspaper reading, chess competitions, and weekend parties. In nature, it is similar to the business of the Writers Association. However, in the past, Chinese cultural and academic groups had the weakness of being flashy and not living up to their name. The Literary and Art Lounge Club started with very practical grassroots work. Since the host is the leader of the Writers Association, with the same ideals and consistent spirit, all members of the Writers Association seem to be able to use the Literary and Art Lounge Club as a base to launch branch work. On the evening of the 16th of this month, when Shanghai literary and art circles held a dinner party at the Literary and Art Lounge, some friends talked about organizing a Shanghai branch of the Writers Association. Now let us have fervent expectations, and use the establishment of a Shanghai branch of the Writers Association and the development of the lounge business to give the All China Federation of Literary and Art Writers Association a meaningful anniversary.

### Idle Talk about "Celebrating the New Year"

— Fang Wen

Also talking about "New Year's Eve Dinner"

The sound of the New Year drums is getting louder, the year is coming to an end, and every household is busy with the last meal of the year, the "New Year's Eve dinner." This is an important embellishment that Chinese people consider indispensable in their life history. Even if the country is so chaotic and the society is so dilapidated, the custom of "New Year's Eve dinner" has always been prosperous and has not diminished in color because of this. It is impossible not to admire the strong spirit of hope that the Chinese people have.

On New Year's Eve, amidst the sound of gongs and drums and the earth-shaking firecrackers, the wealthy families naturally have delicacies from land and sea, lined up on the table. Even the poor families, although with coarse tea and light meals, also enjoy this meal in harmony; the form and content of the "New Year's Eve dinner" are different, but the spiritual expression is the same.

Dinner is eaten every night, so why does Chinese society attach so much importance and enthusiasm to the meal of "New Year's Eve dinner"? I think there are several meanings in it:

A year of hard work, with all kinds of hardships, at this time of the turn of the year, the whole family gathers together to have a hearty "New Year's Eve dinner," on the one hand, to reward the hard work of the past year, and on the other hand, to relax the over-tense nerves.

Life is difficult, and it is difficult to get through the New Year. After all kinds of preparations and painstaking efforts, after eating the "New Year's Eve dinner," everything is settled, waiting for the arrival of the new year. Therefore, a "New Year's Eve dinner" is a table of "reassurance wine."

On weekdays, people are forced to worry about food and clothing, leaving their hometowns and wells, and rushing around. At the end of the year, most of the wanderers return home, and the family reunites, drinking a few glasses together and sharing the joys of family, so as to fill the warmth of the family.

After eating the "New Year's Eve dinner," one is a year older. The "New Year's Eve dinner" is enough to give people a profound reflection of "looking forward and backward" and "carrying on the past and opening up the future."

Northerners curse people "should die," and Shanghainese curse people "can't eat New Year's Eve dinner." Therefore, eating "New Year's Eve dinner" can also be said to be a kind of reply and demonstration to Shanghainese.

With the above meanings, even if the country is so chaotic and the society is so dilapidated, the custom of "New Year's Eve dinner" is still prosperous and has not diminished in color. Our philosophy is inclined to optimism and hope!

### Everyone has gimmicks, but the tricks are different

— Zhuo Qiu

My friend Mr. Zhao has always lived in the residence of a friend on Gordon Road. Last autumn, the second landlord used the excuse of taking it back for his own use and asked him to move out.

Mr. Zhao looked for houses for more than two months, but he was not satisfied with the houses, or he thought the transfer fee was too expensive. So, he was delayed day by day.

Unable to withstand the repeated urging, he finally found a small two-story Western-style house with three rooms from the newspaper. He talked about the transfer fee to seven bars, paid a deposit of one bar with confidence, and went to carry out his fixed plan. Fortunately, the landlord agreed to pay off the remaining transfer fee within ten days.

From tomorrow on, Mr. Zhao was busy receiving batches of male and female guests. It turned out that they saw Mr. Zhao's "house subletting" advertisement and came to discuss the price of the house.

"Two and a half bars for a front room, two and two bars for a sitting room upstairs, the rent is 20,000 yuan per month, the sitting room and kitchen are for public use, the transfer fee is as low as possible, the solution should be quick, these two rooms have been seen by someone yesterday, and they are almost ready to pay the deposit," Mr. Zhao tirelessly used the tactic of breaking through one by one, maneuvering among the male and female guests.

After about a week like this, Mr. Zhao, except for leaving a front room on the east side of the upstairs for his own use, rented out the remaining three front rooms and the sitting room upstairs. Under the transfer fee, he received a total of eight and a half bars. He paid seven bars to the landlord. The house repair fee and advertising fee cost less than one million. The remaining one bar was exchanged for a brand-new set of teak furniture.

"It's so happy. I've been in a house shortage for so long. I didn't expect that now even the right to use and the right to lease everything belongs to me, and I also added a set of modern furniture for my wife to enjoy. Do you think it's worth it?" Mr. Zhao said triumphantly.

Shanghai is a "gimmick city." As long as you can think of tricks, many problems can be cleverly solved. However, in this way, the majority of tenants are still exploited.

### The United States Expands the Civil Aviation Industry

— Translated by Wei Liang

Racecourse changed to airplane ambition, 27% of Americans want to enter the sky

The United States Congress has recently passed the 500 million yuan "Federal Airport Act." This act includes a long-term construction plan that will make the entire United States "grow wings" and spread airports throughout the country.

According to this act, the airport construction plan will be completed in the next seven years. This great plan will greatly encourage the navigation of private aircraft, just like the 2.5 billion yuan national highway program that promoted automobile travel in the past 25 years.

Like the highway construction plan in the past few decades, the government and various states will bear the construction costs of national airports. According to this legislative decision, the federal government will bear 50% of the construction costs of 3,000 airports. In addition to building new airports, the act also stipulates improving the landing positions of existing airports.

After studying the national airport plan submitted to Congress by the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration, we can find that among the 3,050 new airports to be built, 2,900 new airports are small and suitable for private aircraft to land. According to the classification of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, 1,800 of them are first-class and 1,100 are second-class. First-class airports should have one or more runways ranging from 1,800 feet to 2,700 feet in length and more than 300 feet in width. Second-class airports should have one or more runways ranging from 2,700 feet to 3,700 feet in length and 500 feet in width.

These constructions will require states and cities to spend 100 million yuan to balance the federal government's expenditure. All funds will be allocated according to the plan of the Civil Aeronautics Administration. 70% will be allocated by states according to land area and population size. In addition, another 20 million yuan will be used for Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.

People are Fascinated by Flying

These funds will not be used to build and improve privately owned airports. Those who are particularly enthusiastic about private flying can get technical help from the states and the National Aviation Administration. But no matter what, private flying will always be stimulated by the public management of aviation and prosper.

Flying clubs in many cities in the United States are planning to establish flying clubs in large numbers in the countryside. Many retired air force personnel are very interested in the operation of small airports.

It is estimated that there are about 6 million people in the United States who are particularly interested in flying. 27% of Americans really want to fly into the sky. In addition, 250,000 people in the United States have obtained federal flying licenses, and there are 32,900 private aircraft in the United States.

According to the development of the U.S. aviation industry in the past 20 years, the future of U.S. commercial flying can be predicted. In 1925, there were only 500 small airports in the country, but by 1945, there were 4,000 large airports distributed throughout the country. The flight postal route has also increased from 2.5 million miles in 1925 to 25.5 million miles in 1945. The number of air passengers has increased from 20 to 5,138,000.

According to this federal airport construction act, Texas alone will have 532 airports. There are now a total of 319 airports in the state, 196 of which need to be improved. California is scheduled to have 425 airports, Pennsylvania plans to build 271 airports, New York's airport network will consist of 251 airports, and Florida will have 249 airports. The number of airports in other states is less than 200.

The United States Grows Wings

Engineers say: most of the small airports do not plan to lay runways, and second-class airports do not plan to lay runways except in some special areas. It is planned to improve the 1,625 airports whose buildings are to be improved are all grasslands, but improve the equipment on them.

All technical knowledge about these renovation projects will be provided by the American Racecourse Association soon. Its first goal is to launch a national publicity and education program to make everyone understand the value and benefits of developing racecourses into airports. The United States is now investing 400 million yuan in 1.3 million acres of racecourses and other land in order to convert them into airports.

The cost of paving the land for racecourses is less than paving the land for flight runways. Paving the ground for racecourses costs 50 yuan to 750 yuan per acre. If asphalt is paved on the ground, it will cost 4,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan per acre. If reinforced concrete is used, the cost will be between 9,000 and 20,000 yuan per acre.

Due to the expansion of airports and the gradual increase in the number of carriers, privately owned airports also continue to have the need to increase lighting equipment to ensure the safety of flying and night flights. American safety engineers emphasize the necessity of airports setting up rotating warning signs, setting up wind cones, landing angle indicators, communication lights, airport boundary lights, and obstacle lights at the end of runways.

Among these devices, the most important is the landing angle indicator. The cost of this indicator is at most equivalent to a radio used in a family, but it can indeed allow beginners to land safely.

The rapid degree of the comprehensive development of the aviation industry in the next seven to ten years will exceed the development of the automobile industry after World War I. According to general predictions, in the next few years, the number of aircraft purchased by private individuals will greatly increase, small airlines will be established one after another and fly on the branch lines of large airlines. Therefore, in the near future, the United States will really become a "winged" country.

### Down to Earth

— Shao Zhiqing

Taking a plane will crash, taking a ship will be robbed, taking a train will derail, and taking a car will overturn.

These modern means of transportation are life-threatening in China, so we Chinese can only be down to earth - walk. Although walking is slow, we can always reach our destination. (Repayment)

Big and Small Things

Big and small things in the world in the past week are excerpted here.

### Whose Loss is Greater?

— Fang Wen

The red cars of the Shanghai French Concession Tram Company were all sick last week at the same time, walking like a snail, feeling unable to move an inch, making a group of passengers anxious, like ants on a hot pan, restless, neither up nor down. Fortunately, auspicious days helped, and the minor illness was cured in a few days, and it has now returned to its usual speed and power. According to the statistics of the company's capital, a minor illness costs about 40 million yuan per day, but the loss of time for all passengers in these few days cannot be calculated by numbers.

### Huge Difference

— Ming Gui

Hollywood famous movie star Diana Boping obtained a salary of 310,000 yuan from Universal Pictures in 1944 and was listed as the highest-paid woman in the United States by the US Treasury Department. The highest-paid among the 123 senior salaried personnel was Watson, the general manager of International Machines Company, which paid Watson a salary of 425,000 yuan in 1944. In addition, in the list of 593 people published by the Treasury Department in June last year, the highest-paid film director, Mukelei, had an annual salary of over one million yuan.

The above is based on the Washington Telegraph of the Central News Agency on the 9th of this month and published by the US Treasury Department. Please readers do not regard it as "overseas strange tales."

The Chinese salaried class can only respond with a wry smile!

### The Temptation of Sound

— Wen

According to reports, the Japanese have recently invented a new method of fishing. They install machines on fishing boats to emit beautiful music to lure fish, so that they are captured one by one in confusion. In human society, sound and lust are often used to lure their own kind. When they are obsessed with it, they can be treated as a cutting board and fish. This so-called new fishing technique is just extended from the same kind to fish. Humans are the spirit of all things. Those who create the world are humans, and those who destroy the world are naturally also humans.

### "Medical" Kills Five Children

— Wu Hong

"Incompetent doctors kill people" is originally a common saying, saying that incompetent doctors treat illnesses improperly, which is enough to mislead people to death. "Incompetent doctors kill people" has existed for a long time, but it is more intense now. The newspaper reported on the 13th that Chen Wenda, a pediatrician in Guiyang, misused hydrochloric acid strychnine new, and "medically" killed five children within a month, breaking the new record of incompetent doctors killing people. The prosecutor of the Guiyang District Court has completed the investigation of Chen Wenda and filed a public prosecution. A public trial will be held soon.

The doctor's duty is to treat diseases for human beings, but it is heard every day that patients die at the hands of doctors, whether visibly or invisibly. "Life and death are in the sky." Doctors certainly cannot guarantee to cure all diseases, but they should not prescribe needles and medicines indiscriminately and treat human lives as a child's play. What crime should be punished for incompetent doctors killing people? The law has clear provisions. There are also hospitals and doctors who reject patients who cannot afford medical expenses and refuse to save them. Although they are not incompetent doctors, their hearts are more poisonous than incompetent doctors. "Whoever does not have a heart of universal love is not worthy to be a doctor." May all doctors in the world listen.

### There is Still Warmth in the World

— Ming Gui

The Far East Airlines "Luzon Miss" crashed in the sea off Luzon Island. This is another aircraft accident. Among the 36 passengers, 6 were missing. What is worth writing about in this aircraft accident is Ms. Li Suolan, who was swallowed by the waves for saving her friend. She had already been rescued when the plane crashed into the sea. Because she could not bear to see her injured companion Luo Chifeng buried in the sea, she bravely returned to the plane and rescued Luo. However, she herself was exhausted and could not resist the infringement of the raging waves and died tragically. Although Luo Chifeng eventually died of his injuries, Li Suolan's spirit of sacrificing herself to save her friend will be passed on as a good story forever.

In times of distress and life and death, one is not even able to take care of oneself, but can sacrifice oneself to save a person. This matter is enough for people to admire if it comes from a seven-foot tall man. But now it is a woman who was first a prostitute and then a dancer in a pleasure ground. Such people have always been regarded as "soulless" in the city and use their looks to win people's gold and silver. She and Luo Chifeng are only the relationship between a dancer and a dance guest. To put it realistically, even if they already have a "super-friendship" relationship, or are about to further become husband and wife, as the saying goes, "Husband and wife are birds in the same forest, and they fly separately when disaster strikes." Real husband and wife, when it comes to this critical moment, can save each other regardless of themselves, I am afraid that it is not common, let alone Luo Chifeng is only Li Suolan's regular customer?

From this incident, I feel that there is still warmth in this world, and it is still worth cherishing. The "righteousness" that has been extinguished for a long time has been revealed in front of my eyes again. As long as you look for it, you will be able to find the "soulmate" you hope for. "Within ten households, there must be trustworthy people; within ten steps, there must be fragrant grass." Life will not be really cold. In this turbulent era, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame have not been mentioned for a long time. Ms. Li Suolan's self-sacrifice fully demonstrates the word "righteousness" and can be said to be "sacrificing life for righteousness." Mencius said: "When propriety is lost, seek it in the wild." Then, this can be regarded as "righteousness lost and sought in prostitutes"!

I think many "gentlemen" and scholar-officials will not be "indifferent" after reading this news, right?

### The Way of Democracy

— Yecao

MacArthur has recently been praised by Japanese women. The reason is that he not only liberated Japanese women from the oppression of their husbands, but also ordered the Japanese government to distribute 1,200 grams of perfume to beautify "kimono girls." MacArthur solemnly notified the Japanese government last week, saying: "Americans believe that Tokyo is full of colorless lips, shiny noses, and braids, which is not the way of democracy."

### French Political Situation

— Yuan Jia

In all countries in the world, there are generally political parties, and the political party that holds power is always the largest party with the most seats in the parliament. However, the previous French presidential election was unique. In terms of the number of seats occupied by the parliament, the French Socialist Party is inferior to the Communist Party and the People's Republican Party and ranks third; but in this election, the one who was often elected was the leader of the Socialist Party, Oriel and. Is this new political trend a step backward or a step forward? Is it democratic or undemocratic? Does it symbolize the decline or revival of France, which is worth pondering. Let the facts answer!

### The World, The World!

— Source

The Second World War has ended, and the world is at peace, but what we see in the newspapers every day, and what we hear, does not necessarily seem peaceful. On the one hand, the nations of the world are holding grand meetings, earnestly discussing plans for world peace, but on the other hand, they are researching new weapons day and night. One day, it is said that the United States can now produce atomic bombs hundreds of times more powerful than those of the Hiroshima era at a cheaper price; the next day, it is said that a Soviet expedition team ascended to the summit of the Tian Shan Mountains to study cosmic rays, hoping to create weapons even more ferocious than atomic bombs. One day, someone says that germ warfare can kill even more people, and the next day, someone says that the Soviet Union is studying ultraviolet rays in the sun, which can kill people as easily as snapping dry twigs. The world, the world, you are truly a great contradiction!
