[Another Dispatch] The complete list of political party nominations for National Assembly representatives was not released on the 8th, as the revised lists submitted by the Democratic Socialist Party (Min She) and the Youth Party (Qing Nian) are still under discussion in separate meetings of the KMT, Min She, and Qing Nian parties. The Min She and Qing Nian parties have no objections to the revised quotas; their dissatisfaction lies with the coordination of personnel and regions. This task of re-coordination and adjustment is extremely difficult, and the KMT is working on it day and night. Once the lists from both parties are received, the General Election Office will immediately announce the lists from all three parties simultaneously. It is rumored that the announcement may be made at noon on the 9th.

After investigation, it was confirmed that eleven counties—Lihuang, Lu'an, Tongcheng, Taihu, Qianshan, Huoshan, Shucheng, Yuexi, Linquan, Hao County, and Quanjiao—were handling the matter separately due to special circumstances involving communist bandit disturbances. However, thirteen counties—Wuhu, Jiashan, Huoqiu, Fengyang, Taiping, Fanchang, He County, Wuwei, Shou County, Hefei, Dingyuan, Huaining, and Wangjiang—repeatedly ignored telegrams urging them to submit the lists. The ranking county magistrates, who also served as chairmen of the election committees, were given warnings as punishment for neglecting election affairs. Furthermore, the election offices in Tianchang and Xuancheng counties were commended for conducting election work according to the prescribed schedule and achieving excellent results, with the chairmen of the committees providing effective supervision.

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 8th] It has been widely rumored here recently that the central government, in response to requests from the Min She and Qing Nian parties, intends to make rigid allocations of National Assembly representative candidates for certain counties in Fujian Province.

### UNRRA Approved Suspension of Shipments of Materials to Communist Areas in North China; Remaining 20,000 Tons of Materials to be Distributed in China

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 8th] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) General is newly considering the distribution and use of relief materials for North China. The UNRRA Central Committee in Washington discussed the China relief issue on the 7th of this month, but the results were unknown as of the evening of the 8th. It has only been learned that UNRRA has taken two recent actions: The Tianjin UNRRA North China Office received a telegram from the UNRRA China Office in Shanghai yesterday stating: "The UNRRA Central Committee in Washington has approved the suspension of the ships originally scheduled to transport materials to the communist areas via the Grand Canal and has authorized the Tianjin UNRRA Office to immediately begin unloading the cargo. Shanghai has notified President Zhang Qun and the Executive Relief Administration (ERA) of this decision. Funds needed for unloading the cargo and transporting it to the areas have been requested from the ERA." UNRRA recently sent two industrial experts, Mr. Clear and another person, from Shanghai to Peiping to request information on the needs for the rehabilitation of northern industries and mines from the Peiping-Tianjin branch of the ERA. It is reported that UNRRA will reconsider the allocation of industrial and mining equipment in the relief materials for North China. From this, it can be seen that the UNRRA's embargo on materials to North China may change.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] UNRRA officials stated that the UNRRA Central Committee will convene another meeting on the 13th of this month to continue discussing future aid to China. At the previous meeting a week ago, UNRRA Director-General Rooks's proposals, including various plans for assisting China's recovery and reconstruction, were presented for discussion but no decisions were made.

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] The Church World Service announced that approximately 20,000 tons of surplus UNRRA materials are ready for distribution in China. The remaining materials have been stored in warehouses since the agency closed down. The majority of these materials are food and clothing. The distribution in China will be supervised by Henry, the chairman of the American Advisory Committee of the Church World Service in China. Personnel from the ERA will also be invited to participate in the distribution of these clothes and food to the suffering Chinese people.

### US Aid to China Issue to Become Presidential Election Program

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Political observers here believe that the recent calls for aid to China by the Republican Party and the criticism by New York Governor Dewey of Truman's aid to China policy (or lack thereof) may make the China issue a program for next year's US presidential election.

### Eight Japanese Rubber Factories to be Distributed by Four Countries

Most Internal Machinery Unusable

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Eight Japanese synthetic rubber factories have been designated as reparations to be distributed by China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines. Each factory is currently preparing for inspections prior to the drawing of lots by the four countries. However, according to senior members of the Chinese delegation, some of the machinery in the eight factories is already engaged in peacetime work, and most of the remaining machinery is unusable. Under normal circumstances, the eight factories can only produce 2,312 tons of rubber annually. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the portion to be used for reparations is worth transporting. Furthermore, the seven synthetic oil factories, originally scheduled to be included in the reparations along with the rubber factories, have now been removed from the reparations list because some of them have been converted into alcohol factories. In addition, Chinese experts have inspected five of the seventeen ordnance factories designated for reparations to China. These factories have a total of 94,147 pieces of machinery.

### Wang Chonghui Discusses Solving the Northeast Problem: Military and Diplomacy are Equally Important; US Aid to China Enters Concrete Planning Stage

[Our Newspaper Report] National Government member Wang Chonghui discussed the situation in the Northeast yesterday, stating that the solution to the Northeast problem should involve both military and diplomatic approaches to be effective. In the current stage, the military should be the main focus, but diplomacy should not be neglected. Otherwise, even if the military is successful, "unexpected incidents" may occur at any time. The Soviet Union has a specific national policy and goal for the Northeast. Its creation of the current situation in the Northeast is used to confront China and restrain the United States. From this point of view, it is very difficult to achieve success through diplomatic maneuvering. However, although the Soviet Union's policy is fixed, its methods often change based on the actual situation. According to what I know, since the victory, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Northeast problem has changed twice. Therefore, if our military is successful and we coordinate diplomatic efforts, there is hope for the opening of the muddled situation. The US aid to China may currently have entered the stage of concrete planning, but the details are unknown. If there is large-scale economic aid in the future, it should start with currency reform.

The reporter specifically asked Wang Chonghui: What are the international perceptions of the current general election in our country? Wang Chonghui replied: Friendly nations have considerable expectations for our country's general election, hoping that China will enter a democratic era through this. However, the true evaluation of the general election will depend on the actual situation during the voting. If there is no use of force to threaten voting or illegal bribery, then there will be positive comments internationally. Regarding the banning of the Democratic League, Wang Chonghui admitted that it has caused some negative reactions in American public opinion. The government foresaw this beforehand, but had to choose the lesser of two evils. There are two benefits to banning the Democratic League's activities: It can avoid the influence of the Democratic League's propaganda on public morale, and the past activities of the Democratic League in some areas could supplement the Communist Party's deficiencies, causing great harm. Now that it has been banned, there is no need to worry.

### Song Ziwen Announces to Reporters Personnel Changes in Guangdong Province to be Announced Soon; Huangpu Decided to Open its Port; Hainan's Restructuring Delayed

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th] Guangdong Chairman Song Ziwen hosted reporters on the 8th and reported on his visit to Nanjing. He stated: Guangdong Province's current security force is insufficient and the compensation is too poor. Therefore, he has presented to Chairman Chiang for approval to increase the original security regiment by five brigades, for a total of fifteen regiments and 26,000 men. There are practical methods for obtaining personnel, firearms, and supplies. The security in Guangdong is extremely optimistic. The decision on the provincial government's personnel will be announced at the next meeting of the Executive Yuan. The heads of each unit are the most suitable candidates and will certainly enhance work efficiency. An increase in coal supply has been agreed upon with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, increasing by 18,000 tons per month. Other industrial raw materials have also been resolved. The rumors of economic independence in South China are pure fabrication. As for foreign investment in Guangdong Province, it seems to be too early. The problem of opening the Huangpu port has been agreed upon with the Ministry of Communications and can begin immediately. In the initial stage, large ships will be able to directly reach Huangpu, followed by the construction of roads, docks, and warehouses. There is no need for a so-called five-year or ten-year plan; it can be launched with the current capabilities. The issue of restructuring Hainan Island has been decided to be postponed and there are specific methods for suppressing the major bandits on Hainan Island. Whether the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters will be restructured will be determined by the central government. The central government has agreed to provide as much subsidy as possible to Guangdong Province's administrative expenses.

The Soviet Union Actually Opposes China's Participation in Drafting the German Peace Treaty
     The Meeting of Representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers Encounters Setbacks
     〔Report from Our Paper〕London, Radio Broadcast on the 8th: The meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers encountered difficulties today. The Soviet representative rejected the proposal by the British, American, and French representatives to support China's participation in drafting the German peace treaty. An official observer believes that the meeting has encountered setbacks. The representatives of the foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on how many countries should have the right to speak in the drafting of the treaty. This is the same difficulty encountered in Moscow seven months ago. Britain, with the support of the United States, argues that Pakistan should have the right to attend the conference, but France and the Soviet Union are currently unwilling to make a decision on this issue. The Soviet Union argues that the countries participating in the peace conference should be limited to the four great powers and twenty other countries, while the United States argues that all fifty-seven countries that have declared war on Germany should participate. The Soviet representative Smirnov opposed an important proposal by Britain, the United States, and France, that China should be one of the "invited countries" along with the four great powers. Smirnov's specific reason was that China did not sign the German armistice agreement. The Soviet Union believes that Germany must form a central government that has the ability to implement the treaty before it can express its views on the treaty. The United States representative Philip Jaffe believes that Germany's "responsible representatives" should have the opportunity to express their opinions. In addition, the United States and the Soviet Union had a fierce dispute over whether Albania could participate in the conference. The United States opposed Albania's participation, and the meeting ultimately broke up without result.
     〔United Press, London, 7th〕An external spokesman declared today: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech was an attack on British and American policy. It is unfortunate that this statement was made before the four great powers began drafting the peace treaties with Germany and Austria. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to hold a meeting here on the 25th of this month to discuss the German peace treaty. "We earnestly hope for its success." The spokesman denied the editorial in the London Times that the British and American governments had already made up their minds that if the German peace treaty negotiations were to stall again, they would seek another path. It is said that the newspaper's argument is not true. Although past negotiations have failed, we should remember that the treaties with Soviet vassals such as Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria were resolved until the last minute and did not lead to a breakdown. Britain and the western occupied zone of Germany have not established any agreement, nor do they intend to conclude a treaty alone if the negotiations between the four great powers break down.
     〔Associated Press, Berlin, 8th〕On the occasion of the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the German Communist Party here launched a very powerful propaganda movement, capable of making the German people, especially the U.S. military authorities, fully recognize how large the strength of the German Communist Party is.

The United States Should Not Sacrifice Aid to European Reconstruction
     The Harriman Committee Submits a Report
     〔United Press, Washington, 8th〕The President's Committee on Foreign Aid, directly under the President, submitted a research report on the Marshall Plan to President Truman tonight, advocating that $5.75 billion be allocated in the first year to aid Europe, of which more than $3 billion would be grants and would not need to be repaid. The total amount of European aid funds for the next four years should be between $12 billion and $17 billion. The committee is an organization of nineteen social figures, including bankers and labor union leaders, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Harriman. The report, which is 132,000 words long, was unanimously approved and immediately sent back to the White House. It is expected to become the main basis for President Truman's future response to the Paris Economic Conference. Some of the requests from European countries have been reduced. It is said that the United States cannot categorically supply all the wheat needed, agricultural machinery should be reduced by half, scrap steel should be canceled, and mining machinery should also be significantly reduced. The United States is very concerned about aiding the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan to complete their economic recovery, but this aid will cause the United States to suffer considerable sacrifices, including fiscal decisions to prevent inflation. The committee suggested three measures as follows: Another independent agency should be established to manage the Marshall Plan and be given broad powers to facilitate action, but it must cooperate with the government. This point coincides with what the House Foreign Economic Committee discussed yesterday. The existing agencies should immediately find ways to restore limited wartime powers in part to promote exports. Export controls should be extended after the end of February next year, and austerity orders should be issued to limit domestic use of scarce materials for foreign aid. The report also has a detailed analysis of the resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference, stating that its main shortcoming is that it overestimates Europe's ability to recover its industry and promote exports. The report emphasizes that the recovery of German industry, especially the recovery of Ruhr coal production, is essential and should also be given priority and assistance. Totalitarian countries have openly declared war on countries that believe in individual freedom in terms of ideology. If Western countries cannot improve their internal affairs by democratic methods, they may be forced to change course and go in the opposite direction.
     〔U.S. Information Service, Washington, 8th〕President Truman said on the Harriman Committee's report on foreign aid that he was deeply grateful to the members for their handling of such a massive task. The committee's report should help complete a good European aid plan.

Vyshinsky's Remarks
     Mutual Respect is the Foundation of Peace
     〔Reuters, New York, 7th〕The "New York Post" published an interview with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky. Vyshinsky said that if capitalism and communism could respect each other to solve the disputes of the United Nations and establish better international relations, then the two would be able to coexist in one world. Vyshinsky also said that mutual respect is the foundation of peace. Without mutual respect, the Soviet group and the United Nations will not be able to cooperate. When asked what he thought of the achievements of this General Assembly, Vyshinsky said that the General Assembly has not yet ended. Even if there is a good start, if the end is bad, it will still ruin the whole situation. How things will develop in the future is not something that can be predicted.

UN General Assembly Committee Discusses Membership Issues
     U.S. and Soviet Representatives Argue
     U.S. Advocates Limiting the Use of the Veto Power
     〔United Press, Success Lake, 7th〕When the UN General Assembly's Political Committee discussed the issue of new members today, the veto power of the five major powers sparked another dispute. The United States, Argentina, Sweden, Brazil, Iraq, Lebanon, and Chile jointly requested that Italy, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland, and Outer Jordan be allowed to join the UN and asked the Security Council to reconsider. The Soviet Union has used its veto power ten times in the Security Council to prevent these six countries from joining the UN. This action was attacked repeatedly today. U.S. Representative Stevenson said that the veto power has created a tragic record. Regarding the issue of joining the UN, the United States will support abolishing the exercise of the veto power in the Security Council but will oppose the application of those who are not qualified to join the UN. Swedish Representative Hagelberg urged the General Assembly to simultaneously approve the applications for membership of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, and Outer Mongolia to show equal treatment. The United States opposed the membership of these countries, while the Soviet Union expressed its support. Soviet Representative Gromyko spoke for one hour and twelve minutes, responding to the concentrated attacks from various countries. The Chairman immediately announced a recess. This issue will be decided tomorrow.

England's Attitude Towards the Holy Land Issue
     Unwilling to Bear Sole Responsibility for Security
     〔Reuters, London, 8th〕After the U.S. government asked the British government last night to explain its views on the U.S. compromise proposal to implement the partition of Palestine, British Colonial Secretary Jones visited Foreign Secretary Bevin today to discuss the matter. The United States suggested that British troops bear all the responsibility for maintaining security in Palestine during the transition period. According to reliable sources, Britain will reject the U.S. proposal even after the U.S. and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on the method of implementation. This means that Britain intends to end its trusteeship and withdraw from Palestine in the near future and is unwilling to provide any material assistance for the implementation of the partition.

Results of the Australian General Election
     Labor Government Suffers a Crushing Defeat
     Opposition Leader Holway Forms a Cabinet
     〔Report from Our Paper〕London, Radio Broadcast on the 8th: Melbourne News, as a result of the Australian general election, the Labor government suffered a crushing defeat. The Conservative opposition's main attack on the government focused on the government's plan to nationalize banks. Opposition leader Holway will serve as the new Prime Minister. In the new parliament, Holway's Australian United Party will roughly occupy 26 seats, the National Party will occupy 21 seats, and the Labor Party will occupy 18 seats.

Determined to Defend Kashmir
     Indian Army Launches Counteroffensive
     Disturbances Also Occur in the Junagadh Princely State
     〔Reuters, Srinagar, 7th〕Under the cover of armored light artillery and fighter planes, the Indian Army today launched a fierce attack on about 1,000 indigenous troops on the highway from Srinagar west to Baramulla. According to an Indian military spokesman, Indian vehicles have surrounded the two wings of the indigenous army and are continuing to pursue them. At the same time, the Kashmir Provisional Government led by Akbar Shah has formed a national defense militia of 5,000 people. The main square in Srinagar has been renamed Red Square, and the new national flag with a white plow on a red background is hung on public institutions.
     〔Reuters, Mumbai, 8th〕It is learned that the troops of the Junagadh state on the east coast of the Indian peninsula have engaged in the first battle with the troops of the Junagadh Provisional Government. The Junagadh Provisional Government was established to oppose the state's Muslim ruler's announcement to join Pakistan. Its troops attacked the city of Nudiana on the border of the state today. However, the military strength of both sides is limited, and a major war is unlikely to occur.

British Authorities Consider Countermeasures for East European Countries' Violation of Treaties
     Believing that Soviet Vassals' Actions are Deepening the East-West Rift
     〔Reuters, London, 8th〕Over the past few weeks, the suppression of political parties other than the left-wing Socialist Party and the Communist Party in several East European countries has led some members of the British House of Lords to seriously discuss the possibility of severing diplomatic relations with these countries. On Wednesday, former British government chief diplomat Vansittart raised this issue in the House of Lords, and House of Lords Speaker Jowitt also expressed support on behalf of the government for condemning the East European countries' violations of the treaty.
     This week, news of the persecution of opposition politicians has come from East European countries again. Although the leader of the Polish Peasant Party, Mikolajczyk, has fled, three of his comrades have been arrested. The leader of the Romanian Peasant Party, Maniu, is being tried for treason, and the National Liberal Party led by the country's Foreign Minister, Tatarescu, will obviously suffer the same fate. The leader of the Hungarian opposition party, Ferec, has fled the country, and a reorganization of the government controlled by the Slovak Communist Party is also brewing. Since the sudden disappearance of Kovacs, the secretary-general of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, in February this year, and the tragic execution of the leader of the Bulgarian Peasant Party, Petkov, in September, similar incidents have followed, which of course affects the relationship between Britain and other allies and these East European governments. The questions raised by these actions of the East European governments are: What is the East European governments' motive for persecuting patriotic elements? The East European governments' inability to tolerate the peasant and liberal parties has constituted a violation of the treaty. What attitude should the Western allies take? Since the establishment of the Cominform of the nine Communist parties, the East European governments' suppression of opposition parties seems to have intensified, showing that the plan to consolidate the Communist forces in Eastern Europe is being actively carried out. Regardless of whether this London Foreign Ministers Conference can avoid the division of Germany, that is, Europe, the style of the East European governments will obviously seriously increase the trend of division.

Romanian Female Communist Member Pauker Appointed Foreign Minister
     Former Foreign Minister to be Tried for Treason
     〔Reuters, Bucharest, 7th〕After Romanian Foreign Minister Tatarescu and three other Liberal Party cabinet members resigned, Communist member Pauker was appointed Foreign Minister today, Communist member Luca was appointed Finance Minister, Socialist member Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was appointed Minister of Public Works, and Peasant Party member Stoican was appointed Minister of Culture. Foreign Minister Pauker is a woman, 52 years old, and is the first woman in Romania to hold an important position. She joined the Communist Party in 1921. In 1936, she was sentenced to ten years in prison for endangering national security. In 1940, through Soviet persuasion, she was exchanged for a captured Peasant Party member and went to Moscow to serve as an advisor on Romanian affairs. At the same time, Romanian observers believe that Tatarescu and others will soon be charged with treason and brought to trial.

Paris Labor Strikes Gradually Expand
     Public Utilities Come to a Standstill
     〔Reuters, Paris, 7th〕80% of the sanitation workers employed by six companies in the Paris area have gone on strike. The employees of parks, playgrounds, and gardens in Paris have also decided to go on strike. Cemetery managers are also scheduled to vote on a work slowdown today. Since the tax collectors in Paris went on strike on Tuesday demanding a raise, the labor unrest has gradually expanded. The newly affected workers are hospital laundry workers, city transportation workers, street sweepers, and water workers. Employees in the funeral industry are implementing a slowdown movement.

Congratulations from Truman on the Anniversary of the Soviet Union
     〔United Press, Washington, 7th〕President Truman sent a telegram to Soviet Chairman Shvernik today to congratulate him on the anniversary of the Soviet Union, which read: "On the occasion of your country's anniversary, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to the people of your country on behalf of the people of our country."

The Political Strife in Japan Intensifies
     Hirano May Also Be Removed from Office
     〔New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th〕The Japanese House of Representatives continued to discuss the budget issue yesterday. In addition to the questioning by Social Democratic Party member Arahata following the previous day, the Liberal Party followed up with questions, even attacking the government's eight major policies that were touted at the time of the cabinet's formation, saying that none of them had been implemented and that the cabinet really had no reason to continue in office. Prime Minister Katayama and other cabinet members could not answer this, and their embarrassment can be imagined.
     〔New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th〕State Minister Hirano May made an important statement at the cabinet meeting on the 7th, requesting Prime Minister Katayama to dismiss Justice Minister Suzuki and Cabinet Secretary Nishio, thereby making the political situation even more turbulent. Prime Minister Katayama could neither accept his request and dismiss these two, nor could he ignore it. Some in the political world believe that Prime Minister Katayama may dismiss Hirano on the grounds of internal disunity in the cabinet. Also, the Democratic Party expressed shock at the unexpected deterioration of the situation. Chairman Ashida hoped that Hirano would respect himself and strive to prevent the situation from worsening.

Officials from the Allied General Headquarters also announced that other relevant countries that can make the same guarantee can also trade with Japan in their own currency in the same way.

The Shanghai Prison Riot Has Not Subsided
     Prison Cells Are Locked and on Full Alert All Day
     More Than 100 Troublemaking Inmates Detained Separately
     The Cause Was Extortion of 40 Million Yuan from Zhan Liansheng
     〔Report from Our Paper〕The riot of prisoners in Shanghai Prison has not subsided as of yesterday. All prison cells have not been opened all day. The cause of this riot was that three prisoners, Shi Liangen, Zhou Xinglong, and Xu Daichang, who originally worked in the kitchen, extorted 40 million yuan from Zhan Yunsheng, which caused dissatisfaction among other prisoners, leading to the riot. The Shanghai Prison transferred Shi and others to the detention center of the Sinan Road District Court.

Yesterday, Minister Chen Arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing to Supervise the Joint Allocation of Cotton Yarn; China Textile's Cotton Purchase is Still Far from the Target

[Our Newspaper Report] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and met with Chairman Du of the Textile Federation regarding matters related to the joint allocation of cotton yarn. Mr. Chen also visited the Chrysanthemum Exhibition at Fuxing Park.

Another report: Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning to supervise the joint distribution of cotton yarn. Mr. Chen had previously visited Shanghai half a month ago for this purpose, but returned without success due to strong opposition from private yarn mills. The government now considers joint distribution imperative, and the National Economic Commission has also mandated the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take charge, so Mr. Chen came to Shanghai again yesterday to discuss matters with all parties.

After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Mr. Chen immediately summoned Liu Siying, Acting Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and Yuan Zhongda, Director of the Office, to inquire about the opinions of private yarn mills. In the afternoon, he visited Mr. Du Yuesheng to discuss the issue in detail.

Another report: China Textile Corporation has purchased 300,000 dan of domestic cotton this year. The company's original purchase target was 3,000,000 dan. According to the latest figures, this is only one-tenth of the total. With new cotton already entering the market continuously, it is feared that the original target will be difficult to achieve.

The reasons are threefold:

Lack of cash: The company planned to use 6 trillion national currency to purchase 3 million dan of cotton, but cotton prices have risen in various regions, making it impossible to purchase without 12 trillion yuan. Farmers in various regions want cash during purchases and do not accept promissory notes or checks. It is not easy to exchange 6 trillion yuan in cash.

Due to the unrest in the situation, a large amount of cotton in various regions has been burned or damaged.

Traffic congestion: A large amount of cotton is stockpiled in Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Lingshi, and other places. Although it is being transported to Shanghai by air, the limited number of aircraft makes it difficult to transport it smoothly. Loose Credit and Healthy Appetite Lead to Continued Rise in Cotton Yarn and Cloth

42-count Blue Phoenix Yarn Rises Another 1.5 Million

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market experienced a surge due to loose credit and the healthy appetite of traders. Dyeing and weaving factories and various guilds continued to seek purchases. Furthermore, with few private factories opening, the market supply was scarce, leading to another surge in prices. Ultimately, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to rise sharply, with an increase of 1.5 million to 36.5 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also saw increases ranging from 500,000 to over 1 million yuan.

In the cotton cloth market, the morning opened with scattered retail purchases. Merchants from Hankou and Chongqing were actively purchasing, and dyeing factories in the city were absorbing even more strongly. It was also rumored that the supply of the Textile Construction Company would decrease, and credit was unusually loose. All parties were enthusiastic, and prices soared. Subsequently, due to the presence of supervisory personnel at the market to monitor transactions, confidence weakened, and some short-term traders took profits, causing the market to decline slightly. However, as a result, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloth grades were 7,000 to 15,000 yuan higher than the previous day, and other cloths also rose.

Spot Cotton Rises

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was firm. Credit was loose, and buying interest was strong. Yarn mills' appetite was moderate, and inter-dealer trading was more active. Furthermore, with prices rising sharply in the production areas, confidence was boosted. Prices were about 100,000 higher than the previous day, with 2,300 bales traded. The prices for factory delivery were: Lingbao 3.927 million, 3.968 million, Shashi 3.704 million, substandard 3.637 million, Chongsha 3.637 million to 3.704 million, Huoji 2.728 million, and Bailuo Qu 3.844 million, with 1,100 bales traded. The prices for warehouse delivery were: Lingbao 3.844 million, Shandong cotton 3.844 million, Han fine 3.513 million, Chongsha 3.472 million, Laohekou 3.43 million, and Tuolisi 3.844 million, with 1,200 bales traded, and Zhoupu seed cotton 660,000. China Trust's Imported Japanese Woolen Fabric is Still Being Negotiated for Export

Hong Kong Smuggled Goods Have Appeared on the Market

[Our Newspaper Report] China Trust Bureau's 300,000 yards of Japanese woolen fabric imported through barter trade are still stored in warehouses. According to relevant sources, the plan is to export them and purchase wool raw materials for domestic industrial needs. The process is still under negotiation, with foreign governments as the target, not private merchants. However, due to the large amount of foreign exchange required, it will be difficult to achieve results in the short term. Australia is a wool-producing region, but it is not a suitable trading partner because it can process and weave wool itself. Before our country purchased from Japan, the British government had already imported 1.5 million yards and shipped them to Hong Kong, and then smuggled them into our country. This type of Japanese woolen fabric has already been found on the Shanghai market. In addition, 2,000 Japanese bicycles imported through barter trade have been shipped. Recently, the Trade Guidance Committee for Japan has decided to allocate them to various agencies, but according to sources from the China Trust Bureau, there is no news of this matter. The number of 2,000 is very small, and their purchase was also at the cost of our country's resources. If properly handled, it will also benefit the national treasury.

Army Uniform Cloth Sells Well

The woolen fabric market has been calm in recent days. There have been no major fluctuations in the prices quoted by tea houses and large wholesalers. The trend of thin woolen fabrics and serge has largely reached a point where they cannot rise further or fall. Army uniform cloth is selling quite well, but the price is relatively stable. The wholesale price for a whole original bolt is 650,000 yuan per yard, and for a set of one or two sets, the wholesale price is 570,000 to 580,000 yuan per yard. The only buyers are from the Xuzhou area, and their source is Hankou and Hong Kong. Rice Shops Become Active; Both Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Rebound

Yesterday, a total of more than 12,900 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market situation saw a uniform and comprehensive rise in prices. Rice shops became active, with japonica rice rising by 10,000 yuan and indica rice rebounding by 20,000 yuan. Baoyuan and Xianyuan both increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

Flour sales were surprisingly strong, rising by 7,000 to 10,000 yuan. Bran also rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean cake from Shantou and Taiwan was eagerly sought and urgently loaded, rising sharply by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans from Southeast Asia were still in short supply, and merchants from Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Shantou were actively purchasing, leading to continued gains, with prices rising by more than 10,000 yuan.

Kidney beans from Southeast Asia were actively traded, rising by 10,000 yuan. Red beans saw scattered trading and rebounded by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. However, broad beans were hesitant and remained lackluster. Corn from northern ports rebounded by 10,000 yuan for high-quality goods, while medium- and low-quality goods remained stable. Red sorghum saw scattered trading and rebounded from fatigue, rising by 10,000 yuan.

Sesame oil factories were very eager to purchase, continuing to rise by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with the situation gradually rising. Shelled peanuts saw aggressive purchases from Shaoxing, and merchants from Bang also made inquiries, with prices jumping by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan in the middle, and high-quality goods from Beijing also rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

Oil shops were bustling, with all types of oil rebounding. Raw oil rose sharply by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, soybean oil followed suit, rising by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, vegetable oil increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and sesame oil also rebounded by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Sugar Prices Rebound

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a rebound in prices due to the easing of credit. The association's quotations for 24 coarse white sugar initially stood at 910,000 yuan, then rose to 940,000 yuan and 45,000 yuan, an increase of approximately 50,000. 20 medium sand white sugar was priced at 860,000 yuan to 878,000 yuan and 880,000 yuan. The opening price for goods from Shantou and Qingdao was 740,000 to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, cotton red high-quality goods were 850,000 yuan, ordinary goods were 800,000 yuan, and Shunde Qing was 720,000 yuan, totaling several hundred packages.

[Our Newspaper Report] Credit continued to ease yesterday. According to sources from the Central Bank, credit may tighten next week. Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus still ran a deficit of 69.4 billion, with the Bank of China running a deficit of 57.1 billion, the Central Farmers Bank running a deficit of 6.1 billion, the China Trust Bureau running a deficit of 5.55 billion, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau running a deficit of 6.1 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury running a deficit of 600 million.

The dark interest rate was 1.7%, and the stock discount rate was 1.8%. Buyers Make Strenuous Efforts to Support; Chinese Stocks Remain Stable

Yesterday, sentiment in the Chinese stock market was mixed, and demand fluctuated. Although stable, it was doubly difficult. The participation of new short sellers diluted buying interest, and the continued tightening of off-market audits hindered the upward trend. The Hong Kong exchange rate shrank again, and absorption from the Guangdong region was still supportive. The future awaits new stimulus. Trading in Wuhe was sparse and fell for many days. Yesterday, it rebounded to the limit, while most stocks saw slight gains or losses.

Morning Start

The market opened higher due to the Ministry of Finance's expression of agreement to reduce deposit margins. Yongsha opened at 322 yuan and 315 yuan and sold down to 307 yuan and 315 yuan before rising to 312 yuan and 318 yuan. Off-market audits hindered buying interest and pushed the price down to 307 yuan and 311 yuan. Wuhe rose to the limit, pushing the price up to an intraday high of 314 yuan and a deferred high of 319 yuan. China United Cement led small stocks and also rose to a high of 116 yuan. The off-market interest rate remained at 1.35% and 1.8%, which had no impact, but trading was once sluggish, with intraday Sanhe falling to 305 yuan and deferred falling to 308 yuan. Hong Kong Shen Telegraph fell to 5.5 yuan, and Guangdong merchants bought in, pushing the price up to 311 yuan and 315 yuan near noon. After vigorous selling, the upward trend was hindered, and Yongsha closed at 308 yuan and 310 yuan. The morning close saw slight gains in intraday Yongsha, Xinyi, Huaxin, Rongfeng, National Products Cement, and Xinyi, a half-cent gain in Datong, a 10% gain in Hengfeng, a limit gain in Wuhe, and unchanged prices in Qinxing, Sino-French, America Asia, Anshui, and Ye. Xinguang, Yefu, Yonggong, Jinglun, Match, Huafeng, Sino-Silk, Zhongfen, and Tongyi saw declines. Deferred stocks saw slight gains in Yongsha and America Asia, declines in Huafeng, and unchanged prices in Xinyi, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing. Off-market old stocks were stable, and China and World each gained half a cent. Industrial Raw Material Allocation Should Be Improved

(Our Newspaper Report) According to statistics from relevant authorities: The industrial raw materials that are currently in the greatest shortage in the country are dinitrochlorobenzene, caustic soda, tinplate, black iron sheet, phosphorus, potassium chlorate, wood pulp, etc. The import quotas for these raw materials should be appropriately increased. There are also imbalances and unfairness in the allocation of raw materials to various factories through various associations. The government should have a fixed policy for the import and allocation of industrial raw materials in the future, increase the supply to military industries and important people's livelihood industries, and conduct detailed investigations of the production volume of each factory. A dedicated institution should be responsible for the allocation to achieve the goal of fairness and reasonableness. The measures taken by the Hong Kong government in this type of matter are quite worthy of reference. The local authorities have already made detailed statistics of the production volume of each factory, and this is used as the standard when approving foreign exchange sales. All factories that have been approved for foreign exchange are required to add a profit of 30% to the cost when wholesaling and selling their finished products, and merchants add another 30% when retailing. The combined profit is quite generous under stable currency prices, but enforcement is strict. If there are those who do not comply with the regulations, the goods will be confiscated and the responsible person will be sent to court for prosecution. The above method has been very effective. If our country wants to emulate it, we only need to supplement the method with a measure to address the depreciation of currency value, and the rest will be applicable. Unified Bonds Stable; Foreign Stocks Rise

Government bonds were stable with little change. Room 360 and Room 628 bought in, while Room 552 and Room 503 had supply. Unified C opened at 21,600 yuan in the morning, with a high price of no more than 22,200 yuan, and then leveled off slightly. As a result, Grade A and Grade B rose by 400 yuan, Unified C rose by 100 yuan, Unified D rose by 400 yuan, and Unified E was flat. Trading volume was around 7 million.

Foreign stocks continued to advance yesterday amid further contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate. Yisha reached a high price again, and Yibi benefited from dividend distribution, which rose even more. Securities firms in Guangdong actively bought in, and foreign firms had supply. Yisha opened at 213,000 yuan in the morning, with a high price of only 217,000 yuan, and then leveled off. The rise and fall were limited. As a result, Jardine Matheson and Zhisheng rose by half a cent, and Yibi, Yeguang, and Xiangtai each rose by about 10%. The rest saw small gains. 300,000 Pounds of American Tobacco Leaves from Taiwan Shipped to Shanghai

American tobacco leaves produced in Taiwan are of very good quality. The local tobacco merchants association believes that the province has abundant tobacco production and good quality. At a time when the transportation of tobacco leaves from Henan Province is hindered and American tobacco is not allowed to be imported, if the local government can be authorized to allow the surplus tobacco leaves from Taiwan Province to be transported to Shanghai, it would be welcomed by cigarette factories. Therefore, it has sent a letter to the Taiwan Materials Adjustment Committee and submitted it to the Taiwan Provincial Government for approval. Subsequently, the Taiwan Provincial Materials Adjustment Committee replied that the person in charge of the Public Sales Bureau stated that as soon as the Taiwan tobacco industry has surplus tobacco leaves in addition to its own use in the province, they can be shipped to Shanghai. According to tobacco industry news, the Taiwan Provincial Public Sales Bureau recently shipped 300,000 pounds of aged tobacco leaves from Taiwan to Shanghai for sale. Initially, it was offered to various Chinese cigarette factories, but the transaction failed due to price disagreement. Finally, it was sold to a Chinese company operated by a foreign company in the city for 35,000 yuan per pound, with a total value of 10.5 billion. It is said that this year's new tobacco will continue to be shipped and sold one after another. Not Lacking High Prices Sought for Sale; Rayon Prices Weaken Again After Rising

Mill-Made Silk and Silk Goods Buying Interest Are Very Strong

Yesterday, the rayon market lacked the ability to rise due to those seeking to sell at high prices, resulting in fatigue after rising. In the morning, 23 boxes of 120-count 1A Asahi brand bright silk were traded immediately at 88.5 million yuan. The highest Monday price was 90 million yuan, and the selling price had fallen to 7.5 million yuan by noon. The decline continued in the afternoon, with the final selling price being 6 million yuan, with little difference from the price of the previous day.

Mill-Made Silk

Yesterday, the market was thriving, and actual sales were not weak, with transaction prices rising steadily. The opening price for high-grade retail goods in the morning was 64 million yuan, and by noon the transaction price had risen to 66 million yuan. The market was quieter in the afternoon and weaker, with a selling price of 65.5 million yuan. The quoted prices for five-dan orders of various grades were 2 million to 3 million yuan higher than the previous day. Dried silk also increased by about 2 million yuan.

Silk Goods

Yesterday, the silk duvet cover market saw a strong buying interest, with the opening price rising by 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. Dachang and Huaqiang goods were first priced at 46.5 million yuan, then hovered around 75 million yuan, with the closing price for immediate delivery being 80 million yuan and the Monday price being 51 million yuan. It was slightly softer in the afternoon, with the off-market price being slightly more than 100,000 yuan lower than the morning price. The price of rayon goods was moderate due to stable raw materials. High-grade Hua Jin crepe was quoted at 54,000 yuan, and silk goods such as crepe satin were firm yesterday. China Trust Stipulates Rayon Allocation Price

(Our Newspaper Report) The Central Trust Bureau, based on the Rayon Conference of November 8, announced the allocation prices for rayon from the 10th to the 15th of next week as follows: Toyo Daifuku 1A (per case) 63.54 million yuan, 2A 62.26 million yuan, 3A 60.36 million yuan, 4A 57.18 million yuan, Tianqiao 1A 63.28 million yuan, 2A 62.22 million yuan, 3A 60.12 million yuan, 4A 56.96 million yuan. Other miscellaneous brands: 1A 63 million yuan, 2A 61.74 million yuan, 3A 59.86 million yuan, 4A 56.7 million yuan.

Application Forms Submitted to the Bureau for Review

(Our Newspaper Report) A spokesperson for the China Trust Bureau claimed yesterday that the bureau allocates rayon based on the application forms submitted by various associations and factories, including the number of machines and the amount of silk required. On October 15th and 16th, the bureau convened various relevant associations to openly discuss the ratio of each association in order to be fair. At present, various associations have prepared new application forms based on this ratio and are sending them to the bureau one after another. The bureau now stipulates that these forms should still be reviewed in detail. Those in this city should be sent to the Shanghai Social Bureau for review, and it has been decided that:

Allocation will be made according to the new ratio in the second week of this month.

If the review is not completed by the second week of this month, allocation will be made at 4% of the new ratio first.

Allocation will be suspended during the review period, and it will be allowed to be made up when allocation continues. Foreign Tea Traders Have Few Transactions

Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, exporters negotiated with suppliers for export tea, but it was difficult to reach an agreement, so the number of transactions was only sporadic. In terms of price, except for Wenzhou merchants who raised the price by 100,000 yuan per dan, other merchants in Sui'an raised prices by about 50,000 yuan, and the base price was quite firm. As for domestic sales of fancy tea, the buying interest from shops in the city was not inferior to the previous day, but the insistence of the main holders became more and more intensified, so the supply and demand gradually became unbalanced, and the transaction fell sharply. The situation continued to be tense. Second District Match Association Requests Allocation of Raw Materials

(Our Newspaper Report) The Second District Match Association is located in southern Zhejiang, and has not received the benefits of quota allocation in the past. Recently, various factories have jointly submitted a document to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with the production figures for the past six months attached, requesting an allocation of US$36,000 in raw materials. Industrial Loan Committee Reviews Loans and Approves 7.3 Billion Yuan

(Our Newspaper Report) The Industrial Loan Review Committee of the National Bank Discount Committee held its 31st regular meeting at 4 pm on the 7th of this month in the conference room of the Discount Committee on the fifth floor of No. 24 Waitan. More than a dozen committee members, including Huang Shoumin, Wang Xingyao, Shi Jiuqian, Ouyang Lun, and Zhou Jinshui, attended the meeting. Shi Jiuqian served as chairman, reviewing industrial loan applications, and approved 30 cases, amounting to 7.3 billion yuan, but it still needs to be re-approved at the discount meeting next week. Commercial Briefs

The Jianghai Customs recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance, which was transferred by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stipulating that light bulbs of 100V to 120V and 210V to 230V are temporarily allowed to be imported.

In the past, our country needed to purchase industrial equipment from Japan for industrial purposes and exchanged it for sand. The China Merchants Bureau estimates that it will transport 50,000 tons of sand per month.

Yesterday, the cigarette market was very active, and merchants and new buyers were all seeking purchases, and the market was strong.

Fifth Anniversary of the Passing of Master Hongyi by Weng Guiyue

It has been five years since Master Hongyi passed away. Tomorrow, his friends and disciples will hold a memorial service for him at the Jade Buddha Temple, and his posthumous calligraphy will also be exhibited.

The Master's secular surname was Li, his given name was Shutong. He once studied in Japan and devoted himself to promoting new art after returning to China. He can be called the founder of new art in China. He was good at calligraphy, and his regular script can be called unique in modern times. He acted in dramas, worked as an editor in newspapers, and also taught, making great contributions to the new art scene. When he abandoned his teaching position and quietly went to Hupao Temple to become a monk, his friends, his students, and people who loved his art were all surprised, thinking that he had been stimulated to some extreme degree, so he became negative and became a monk. At that time, his family rushed to the temple to kneel down and beg him to return to secular life, but they were all rejected by him. He was determined to convert. His cultivation after becoming a monk tells us that he was not negative. He always had compassion in his heart, thought of all living beings, and wanted to awaken the living beings in the haze and lead them to the other shore. Therefore, he did not leave the world, he was still in the world. It's just that his work of saving the world is invisible.

Although the Master has been dead for five years, his art is immortal, and his virtue is always green like the green hills! Answer to the Question by Wang Pingling

Why is the corruption trend in China more prevalent in later generations? Mr. Gu Yanwu of Kunshan has a good answer to this question. He said: "The reason why modern corrupt officials are more than those in the Tang and Song dynasties is not because the officials in the Tang and Song dynasties were honest, but because they are poorer today. It is because the currency in the Tang and Song dynasties was copper coins, and the currency in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties was silver. Coins are heavy and difficult to move, while silver is light and easy to carry. It is difficult to transport, so even taking a little is considered a lot, and it is easy to transport, so even taking a lot is considered a little."

Indeed, it is not very convenient to carry more than 100,000 strings of copper coins back home to enjoy prosperity. Tang and Song were famous for corrupt officials. Even if they could collect a room full of copper coins, converted into today's numbers, it would be worth at most ten US dollars on the black market. How convenient it is to carry ten US dollars. Copper coins are a rigid metal, with sound and color, and are more easily reported. If you encounter an iron-faced and selfless official like Liu Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty, even if your own son takes a five-铢 coin from the warehouse and wears it on his earlobe as a game, he will be punished for corruption and beheaded to show the public. This makes ancient civil servants who intend to collect copper coins have to be careful. Today, since the issuance of 10,000 yuan banknotes, the black market for US dollars has also risen sharply. Each bundle is 1 billion or 100 billion. Although the numbers have increased, the quantity is still not large. If Mr. Gu Yanwu were alive today, he would inevitably sigh and say based on his new discovery: "Alas! The prevalence of corruption, I don't know where it will end!"

Moreover, (that is my opinion.) Ancient civil servants, even if they collected a boat or a dou of copper coins, would at most build more houses and land. Now, if they collect US dollars, they can live in foreign houses, drive cars, arrange a large number of concubines and mistresses, and live a leisurely life. Therefore, since people are not sages, who can avoid vulgarity? If there is an opportunity, why not take it? If you succeed, you can enjoy it for a lifetime, and if you fail, you will not be beheaded to show the public.

In addition, today's society is obsessed with money. As long as you have money, who will verify the origin of the money? Even if corrupt people are ashamed of their conscience, it will not harm everything about themselves. If they can show a little compassion to the countless poor people trapped on the starvation line and take one-ten-thousandth of the total wealth, then the beautiful name of doing good deeds and helping those in need will still be praised everywhere and spread throughout the universe. Therefore, the status of corrupt people can be respected by all aspects of society even more because of the increase in US dollars and gold. In this situation, hoping that civil servants do not want money is much more difficult than hoping that soldiers are not afraid of death. The authorities must ensure that civil servants do not want money and must make civil servants afraid of death.

Cherishing life and fearing death is human nature. Anyone who wants money must be afraid of death, because they must first live in order to give full play to the wonderful use of money. Today's corrupt people have personally discovered that there are many people who want money, and none of them have been killed. They are always successful everywhere and good at using their connections; while a very small number of people who really do not want money are thrown into the 18th level of hell and can never raise their heads again. These realistic lessons are projected in front of them like shadows on a screen. Why don't they be more realistic, seize the opportunity, and never let go, doing everything to their heart's content! But if they can be iron-faced and selfless, enforce the law like a mountain, and do not give discounts, so that "those who want money must die," and absolutely fear death, they will never dare to "try the law." I think there may be people who "want money but don't want life," but there are definitely not many.

Because of the fear of death, they dare not want money. At the same time, they should eliminate extravagance as much as possible so that the rich cannot indulge in their enjoyment of horses, dogs, voices, and colors. On the one hand, they should advocate frugality, value academics, and encourage the development of production. In a certain period, they will be able to change customs and gradually create an atmosphere of not wanting money. Further, they will encourage civil servants to dedicate themselves to the country, embrace the spirit of "not being afraid of death," work hard to govern, use only the virtuous, and bring the world to a prosperous age of peace. Experimental Factory for Students Studying in the United States by Liangzai

Linden, NJ, in New Jersey, USA. On the wall of a building, there are several Chinese characters forcefully embedded: "China Engine Manufacturing Plant." This is a "self-owned" Chinese factory on American soil.

This factory originally belonged to the US Navy Department during the war. Chinese engineering students studying in the United States took a fancy to it. They hoped to turn it into an experimental factory, manage themselves, and work themselves to seek technological advancement. As a result of discussions, a donation was launched. After many efforts, more than 1,000 overseas Chinese scattered in the United States, Canada, and Latin America finally supported and purchased this factory.

After reaching an understanding with the United Electrical Workers Union U.E.W., they officially started construction. Except for a few American workers, the important technical management work was almost all undertaken by these promising young students. They wore greasy work clothes and operated enthusiastically. Sometimes they had to discuss difficult problems and learn from each other at the dining table.

The "China Engine Manufacturing Plant" is now limited in production due to the difficulty of purchasing steel. It can produce about 2,000 to 2,500 engines per month, which are used exclusively to assemble refrigerators. They plan to expand again to reach the goal of producing 6,000 units per month.

The words "China Engine Manufacturing Plant" were written by Dr. Hu Shi. The big blue sky and white sun national emblem added by the students on the wall also emits a dazzling light in the sun. Humor of the Direct Tax Bureau by Simang

A few days ago, in a friend's office, I accidentally found several forms, which were the "Consolidated Income Tax Total Income Report Form" of the Direct Tax Bureau. Among them, two items were particularly ridiculous, one was the living expenses of direct relatives, and the other was the education expenses of children in middle schools and above. The living expenses of direct relatives are 100,000 yuan, and the education expenses of children are 50,000 yuan. I don't know what standard this is based on? It is probably that the person who set the standard still thinks that the current prices have returned to the situation ten years ago. If he set it according to the current situation, then 100,000 yuan can buy a little more than one dou of rice, and 50,000 yuan can buy an ordinary textbook. If it is

### Discussion on the Issue of Popularly Elected County Magistrates by Chu Tze-run

Our nation's constitution is scheduled to be implemented on December 25th, which is not far off. With little time remaining, the entire country is actively preparing for general elections so that constitutional governance can be implemented as scheduled. However, the foundation of constitutional governance lies in local autonomy. Therefore, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Kuomintang, held in March of this year, passed a resolution on preparations for the implementation of constitutional governance, also emphasizing local autonomy. Article 8 stipulated: "In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, draft general rules for provincial and county autonomy, accelerate the implementation of local autonomy, and implement popularly elected county magistrates." Recently, the Ministry of Interior is drafting "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy," "Law on the Election and Recall of County Magistrates," and "Implementing Regulations," submitting them to the 20th Executive Yuan regular meeting for discussion. This article discusses the issue of popularly elected county magistrates and provides some opinions for the authorities to adopt.

That county magistrates should be popularly elected is, in principle, beyond doubt; and implementing popular elections for county magistrates is a prerequisite for implementing county autonomy. Only then will the ideal of popular sovereignty not be empty talk, and democratic politics will have a foundation. We believe that after the popular election of county magistrates, the reform of county administration will have at least the following two advantages: After county magistrates are changed from being appointed to being popularly elected, the people will naturally have the right to remove county magistrates who violate the law and neglect their duties at any time. With the power of appointment and removal in the hands of the people, county magistrates will naturally have to take seriously the reasonable demands of the people, and the greedy and despicable acts of harming the people and enriching themselves by exploiting government orders will not be as unscrupulous as in the past when county magistrates were appointed by higher-level authorities. A democratic oversight system can be established, and the trend of corruption can be slightly curbed. Only in this way can there be hope for clarifying officialdom. County magistrates elected by the people should be more harmonious with the people than appointed county magistrates. Lower-level situations are easier to convey to higher levels, and autonomous work and all measures should be more in line with the people's sentiments. It is easier to gain the trust and support of the people, and government affairs can be promoted more conveniently, resulting in the benefits of smooth governance and harmonious human relations.

However, the popular election of county magistrates may give rise to various malpractices in the initial stage of implementation, which we must carefully consider. The people do not have sufficient training in exercising the four rights and often do not value this sacred right to vote, and exercise it casually. Therefore, in the current situation, implementing popular elections for county magistrates inevitably leads to numerous malpractices, such as acting on emotions, voting as a favor, or arbitrarily abandoning the right to vote. As a result, those elected become ambitious individuals who campaign in various ways. It is difficult to achieve the ideal standard of selecting the virtuous and capable. The people's cultural level is too low, and they lack the ability to understand and distinguish the political views of candidates, and do not know how they affect the vital interests of public organizations. They often prioritize localism or are compelled by feudal forces, clan concepts, traditional ideas, and stubborn prejudices, and are unwilling to sacrifice personal interests for the benefit of society. The task of the county magistrate is not only to handle the inherent affairs of the county corporation (autonomous affairs), but also to be directed by the provincial government to handle the entrusted affairs of the central government and the province. Therefore, the county magistrate is, on the one hand, the head of local autonomy in the county, and on the other hand, an administrative official, a criminal prosecutor, a conscription officer, a police officer, and also the head of the national guard, the head of the land tax and food administration office, conscripting soldiers and food, demanding the people's money, demanding the people's lives, all of which must be "strong before they can be done." In terms of logic and reason, popularly elected county magistrates often take reducing the burden on the people as a reward for the people's support. Therefore, they inevitably have a perfunctory and procrastinating attitude toward entrusted matters, using sympathy for the people's difficulties as an excuse to please the masses, resulting in the abandonment of all government affairs and a complete lack of progress, inevitably affecting the promotion of national policy.

The above-mentioned difficulties are inevitable. Therefore, some people advocate adopting an indirect election system instead of the direct method, while others advocate restricting the right to be elected through examinations to remedy the shortcomings of direct elections. However, Article 126 of the new Constitution stipulates: "County magistrates shall be elected by the people of the county." The method of election is based on Article 129 of the Constitution: "Various elections stipulated in this Constitution shall, unless otherwise specified in this Constitution, be conducted by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot." Since the method of popular election of county magistrates is not specifically stipulated in the Constitution, the direct election method should naturally be adopted; otherwise, it would violate the Constitution. Therefore, the direct election method for popular election of county magistrates cannot be abandoned because of a minor setback, and should not be changed. Even if direct elections inevitably lead to malpractices at present, the people should still be allowed to learn in practice.

As for restricting the qualifications of candidates for county magistrate through examinations to remedy the shortcomings of direct elections, the Ministry of Interior can represent this view. It believes that the first thing to consider when planning for popular elections of county magistrates is the issue of qualifications for candidates, and believes that it is necessary to adopt examination methods in both law and fact. In addition to handling county autonomy, county magistrates also have the responsibility of executing the entrusted affairs of the central government and the province. When executing entrusted affairs, their position is completely consistent with that of ordinary civil servants. Therefore, when implementing popular elections of county magistrates, examinations should be conducted first to determine the qualifications of candidates, and then the people should vote and elect them, so that respect for public opinion is still combined with the intention of selecting the virtuous and capable, which is in line with the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, which advocates using the examination system to remedy the shortcomings of the election system. However, according to the new Constitution, the examination system is not adopted for various fake candidates. That is, the National Government's Measures for Examination and Review of Candidates for Public Office, previously promulgated by the National Government, has also been explicitly abolished by the National Government, and the review of candidates for public office in various places has long been suspended. Now, singling out the qualifications of candidates for county magistrate requires first passing an examination, which is not only without any basis in the Constitution, but also obviously unfair. Therefore, at the recent Executive Yuan meeting discussing this case, some people advocated avoiding the use of the words "examination to determine qualifications" for candidates for county magistrate to avoid constitutional conflicts. Instead, a list of positive and negative qualifications should be stipulated in the County Magistrate Election Law as a supplement. However, the author believes that there are still problems with this point and does not dare to agree. According to the election laws for various elected personnel formulated based on the new Constitution, there are no restrictions on the positive qualifications of candidates. Now, imposing strict restrictions on the qualifications of candidates for county magistrate alone seems unfair.

So how should the problem be solved? In the author's opinion, the candidate nomination method should be adopted. To improve the qualifications of candidates for county magistrate, holding examinations is not allowed by the Constitution, and listing positive qualifications in the election law is also impossible in practice. Therefore, the only option is to adopt the candidate nomination method. In the current election of National Assembly representatives and legislators, there are two types of nominations: voter nomination and party nomination. This can not only reduce the costs of campaigning, reduce unnecessary infighting between candidates, but also promote social justice and promote social opinion. Therefore, to prevent the drawbacks of popular elections of county magistrates, it seems that the nomination method can be adopted. What is the method? It is nothing more than (1) County residents' nomination, which must be signed by a certain number of voters in the county; (2) County council nomination, which must be signed by a certain number of councilors; (3) Nomination by the provincial government, which supervises autonomy. It seems that nomination by the provincial government has the suspicion of the higher-level government taking over the election. It is also not easy for voters without election experience to nominate suitable and ideal candidates. Therefore, among the three, the county council nomination seems to be the best. After the county council nominates, the voters elect. In terms of law and reason, it is more appropriate. The quality of county councilors is higher, and the candidates they nominate are naturally more suitable. There is no name for examination or restriction of candidate qualifications, but the reality of improving candidate qualifications.

### Gong Xuesui's Report in Beijing

(Continued from page 1) Gong said: The Dalian Municipal Government is still exiled in Shenyang. The people of Dalian are eagerly awaiting the reunion with their country, and more than 50,000 people have left Dalian to embrace the motherland. They are all intellectuals who understand the country and the international situation. However, in the Northeast, where there is a surplus of talent, even finding a job as a sweeper is impossible today, so they have no choice but to become beggars or servants. They are suffering from the fact that they have gone from enjoying a comfortable life in the past to becoming refugees. He said that he himself is a "Mayor of Difficult People," and will continue to be a "Mayor of Refugees" in the future. He will lead this group of difficult people into Dalian when the Dalian issue is resolved, and the power that will be generated will be very great. He said: I can say that these people can be worth 100,000 soldiers, and we can use this to win over the hearts of the people in Dalian. He came to Beijing this time to appeal for emergency relief for these more than 50,000 refugees. After arriving in Beijing, he has received the support of Mo Dehui, Shen Yi, and others, and will launch a fundraising campaign. The fundraising target in Beijing is 200 million national currency. (The overall target is 200 million circulation vouchers, equivalent to 2.3 billion national currency.) In addition to Beijing, Cheng Qiuyue is currently holding a charity performance in Beiping, and Tianjin can obtain 400 million yuan through holding art exhibitions and ball games. Xi is scheduled to go to Shanghai in a few days to carry out fundraising work, and will return to the Northeast after completion.

### Source of Glass Found in Yu Zisan Suicide Case

Students at Jinling University Boycott Classes for One Day

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] Zhejiang University President Zhu Kezhen returned to Hangzhou from Beijing yesterday. He told reporters that after returning to Hangzhou, he heard that the court had sent personnel to the Security Command to search under the floor of Yu Zisan's room in the original detention center and found more than a dozen pieces of broken glass. The blood glass was pieced together to form about two-thirds of the window glass, which revealed that the source of the blood glass was window glass fragments that had been discarded under the floor and accidentally exposed in the gap between the floor and the wall. With this clarification, one point of doubt in this case can be reduced. As for the details of Zisan's arrest and tragic death, the school has already sent pictures to be published in various newspapers. The oral conversations in various newspapers are often reported differently. It is hoped that the court will publicly conclude the case as soon as possible so that the truth will come out.

### Handling the Aftermath of the Democratic League; Internal Notification to All Localities to Comply

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The government announced that the Democratic League is an illegal organization and notified the public security authorities of all provinces and cities. The League immediately appointed Mr. Huang Yanpei to come to Beijing to negotiate with the government on the conclusion and aftermath of the Democratic League. The government presented three points, and Mr. Huang raised two requests, which were also answered by the government, as reported in the newspapers. The original text of the telegram issued by the Ministry of Interior to all provincial and municipal public security agencies for compliance in accordance with government instructions is as follows:

"After the government announced that the Democratic League was an illegal organization, this department issued instructions to comply. Subsequently, the League appointed Huang Yanpei as a representative to come to Beijing to negotiate with the government on the conclusion and aftermath of the Democratic League. The government proposed the following measures: The government has announced that the Democratic League is an illegal organization and hopes that the League will end on its own and relieve the responsible persons of their responsibilities. Regarding housing: 1. The houses and objects of the Communist Party that are managed by the Democratic League shall be handed over to the government for acceptance immediately. 2. The houses owned by the Democratic League can be accepted. 3. The houses allocated to the Democratic League by the government should be returned. If they cannot be moved out temporarily, they can be temporarily borrowed. 4. The personal residences of League members will not be interfered with. 5. The houses on Zhu Baosan Road in Shanghai that are held by the Democratic League on behalf of the Communist Party will also be accepted by the government. If the school cannot move out temporarily, another borrowing method should be discussed. Huang also requested two points: 1. All League members in various places should be exempt from registration and enjoy all legal freedoms. 2. If the government believes that League members in various places have illegal activities, or those who have been arrested for cases, the government will handle them according to law. If there is no factual evidence of Communist Party membership, the measures for handling the Communist Party in the rear area will not be used. The government has replied as follows: If the Democratic League can follow the official announcement released by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior to dissolve itself and cease activities, the registration procedures for League members in various places can be exempted, and legal freedom will be guaranteed. However, if there are any illegal activities in the future under the guise of the name, the public security organs in various places should still handle them according to law. If the judicial organs determine, based on the results of the investigation, that League members arrested in cases are not members of the Communist Party or are not Communist Party workers, the provisions of the measures for handling the Communist Party in the rear area may not be applied. It is urgently requested that this be circulated for compliance."
