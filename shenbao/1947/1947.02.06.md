President Song's Speech

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan, in order to encourage the production and transportation of export goods, has submitted a plan for rewards to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval on the 5th, which will be implemented from February 6th. Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei announced the following written statement by President Song at a press conference at 4 p.m. on the 5th: "Since our country has experienced a long period of resistance war, export trade has been on the verge of stagnation, and as a result, the economic vitality of the inland is also on the verge of extinction. Since the victory, due to the destruction of transportation in various places, it has not been restored to date. Goods produced in the inland feel the pain of transportation obstruction. As the mileage and time increase, capital is accumulated, and transportation costs increase, the cost of goods also increases. With the increase in interest rates, the cost may have doubled in a few months. Furthermore, the quality of export goods needs to be improved, and standards need to be established. All of these difficulties and obstacles have made it difficult to promote export trade.

The government is seeking to resolve the above-mentioned difficulties and is making every effort to study strategies to encourage the production and export of export goods. Therefore, an Export Promotion Committee has been established under the Supreme Economic Council, which was established on January 15th of this year. At the same time, the government firmly believes that in order to establish a permanent and sound foundation for our country's export trade, it is necessary to concentrate the experience and strength of the industrial and commercial sectors to be effective. Therefore, the Export Promotion Committee is currently hiring experienced and prestigious figures from the industrial and commercial sectors at home and abroad to serve as consultants and assist in the work, in order to achieve the important tasks of promoting guidance and studying the development of export trade. The committee itself does not engage in any export trade, nor does it intend to monopolize or control export trade."

### 100% Subsidy Granted for Foreign Exchange Settlement of Export Goods

Based on the opinions studied by the Export Promotion Committee of the Supreme Economic Council, the Executive Yuan has submitted a plan to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval today to encourage export trade, which will be implemented from February 6th. That is, from February 6th, when export goods are settled for foreign exchange, the government will provide a subsidy of 100% of the export price. Except for goods exported from the Nine Eastern Provinces and Taiwan Province, because their currency value is in a more advantageous position for the export of goods, no subsidy is required. All goods exported from any port are subject to this rule. The government has also decided to raise the funds for this subsidy by levying an additional tariff of 50% of the ad valorem value on imported goods based on customs valuation from February 6th. However, all machinery and production supplies in Appendix (1) of the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade promulgated on November 17th of last year, and rice, wheat, wheat flour, coal and coke, cotton, fertilizer, and ammonium sulfate in Appendix (2) are exempted from the tariff. All of these imported goods exempted from additional tariffs are essential for production and daily use, accounting for about 60% of the total value of all imported goods. Other goods that have arrived at various ports before February 5th are also exempted.

After the above measures are implemented, export trade can be made more active, which is a necessary measure for promoting foreign trade and reviving the inland economy.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] The Ministry of Propaganda held a reception for reporters at 4 p.m. on the 5th, and issued a written statement from President Song, explaining the establishment of the Export Promotion Committee by the Supreme Economic Council and announcing measures to encourage export trade.

### Production of Export Goods May Increase as a Result

Remarks by a Leader in the Financial Industry

[Our Newspaper Report] The government has adopted an export subsidy system and increased import taxes on certain imported items. The reporter made a special visit to a leader in the financial industry yesterday. According to observations, the government originally had an overall plan for foreign exchange and import and export policies, and now it is gradually being implemented. The analysis is as follows: First, opening the foreign exchange market, then reaching the stage of adjusting foreign exchange rates, and then implementing a comprehensive import licensing system to achieve an export subsidy system. This is the only reasonable policy formulated after considering the domestic and international economic and financial situation. According to the explanation, if the government's export subsidy is 100%, it means that the current foreign exchange rate of 3,350 yuan is doubled to 6,700 yuan to purchase the bills of exchange of various exporters. At the same time, the increase in import tax revenue is used to compensate the exporters, which is a win-win situation. It is not believed that the prices of domestic import and export goods will increase as a result. However, it is speculated that this may increase the production volume of export goods. At the same time, efforts should be made to ensure that cooperative producers benefit more from it and to eliminate the exploitation of intermediaries. As for whether the international market price of our country's export goods will fall as a result, it is believed that there is no need to be pessimistic. There are many customers in the international market, and the demand is not limited to one country. Due to the effect of competition, prices will not tend to fall. It is hoped that our country's exporters can make good use of this good opportunity, strive to improve, and then our country's export industry may have a chance to rise.

### Rumors of Foreign Exchange Adjustment Suddenly Lose Support

Prices of Gold, Paper Money and Goods Should Tend to Stabilize

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, after the market spread the news that the government decided to adopt an export subsidy system, the long-brewing rumors of foreign exchange adjustment suddenly lost support, so the gold and paper money market situation in the afternoon tended to be calm. According to observations from all sides, after the implementation of the export subsidy system and the increase in import tax rates, the defects of the current foreign exchange rate are expected to be compensated, and there is no need for adjustment. It is expected that the current import deficit of our country will gradually improve. International payments can also move towards a balanced state. Prices of gold, paper money, and goods will naturally tend to stabilize.

### Zuo Shunsheng's Opinion

CCP Statement Cannot Achieve Results

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] A reporter recently asked the Youth Party for their opinion on the statement issued by the Communist Party, emphasizing the power of the Political Consultative Conference and denying the treaties and other procedures such as loans made by the government to foreign countries? According to Zuo Shunsheng, the Communist Party has closed the door to peace talks, and the Political Consultative Conference has lost its effectiveness. As for the Communist Party's inability to recognize and be responsible for various foreign affairs, we believe that it cannot achieve any results.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng said: The key to the Communist Party's failure in the past year is three: (1) refusing the National Army to take over the Northeast. (2) refusing the ten-day truce in Zhangjiakou. (3) recently insisting on two preconditions and closing the door to peace talks. After these three mistakes, it seems that the Communist Party is difficult to reverse the situation.

### Export Promotion Committee Hires Chinese and Foreign Personnel as Consultants

[Central News Agency Nanjing 5th Dispatch] Since the promulgation of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, the management of import affairs has been handled by the Provisional Import Management Committee established by the Supreme Economic Council. The council has recently been approved to establish an Export Promotion Committee as a supervisory and auxiliary agency for the development of foreign trade.

The Export Promotion Committee Chairman is the chief of the committee and the committee members are the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Economic Affairs, the Minister of Transportation, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Chairman of the Resources Committee, and the personnel designated by the Chairman of the Supreme Economic Council (currently Dr. Zou Bingwen). The tasks of the committee are: (1) To study and resolve the various difficulties encountered by various export goods in various parts of the country. (2) To cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to encourage the production of export agricultural products and the increase in their quantity, and to assist in the establishment of processing and manufacturing industries when necessary to facilitate exports. (3) To adjust the existing methods of assisting export trade and thoroughly improve them, so that the original related industries can be quickly modernized to facilitate export trade. (4) To promote the stability and large-scale demand of foreign consumer markets for our export goods.

### Executive Committee Established to Promote Work

In order to facilitate the promotion of work, the committee has established an Executive Committee, with the Governor of the Central Bank serving as the chairman, and one person (Yang Xiaoren) designated by the Supreme Economic Council as the vice chairman. One representative from the Ministry of Transportation (Jin Shixuan), the Director of the Central Trust Bureau (Liu Gongyun), and the Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank (Lin Fengbao) serve as members, responsible for providing the committee with recommendations on various related policies and implementing the plans already formulated by the committee.

In addition, the committee has hired well-known Chinese and foreign figures in the export trade industry, such as Wang Yangxian, Gu Geng, Yu Wang, Xie Kang, Li Rui, Xu Guangchi, Guo Shixun, Shu Yunzhang, Zhang Jiachou, Chen Changtong, Ouyang Lun, U.S.Hearkson, J.H.Keswock, A.E.Markr, C.Rogers, J.H.Liddell, etc., as consultants to the committee, in order to pool their wisdom.

### Regional Sub-committees are Actively Being Organized

The Executive Committee, in accordance with regulations, may station regional representatives or establish sub-committees in major commercial ports in the country to listen to business intelligence reports and improvement opinions in each region. These regional representatives or sub-committees may also hire local experienced exporters, wholesalers, and other members of the advisory committee to consult on specialized issues related to export trade. Regional sub-committees in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, and Pan Yang are to be established first and are currently being actively organized.

### Wang Bingnan and Mei Yi Host a Reception for Reporters from Beijing and Shanghai

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] Wang Bingnan and Mei Yi, of the Communist Party Liaison Office in Beijing, held a tea party at 8 p.m. on the 5th to entertain reporters from newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, and there were also Yangko dances, etc.

### Content of the CCP Statement

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] The Communist Party issued a statement in Yan'an on the 1st, which was announced in Beijing on the 5th.

### Democratic League to Hold Central Standing Committee Meeting Today

[Our Newspaper Report] The Democratic League is scheduled to hold a Central Standing Committee meeting at 3 p.m. today. In addition to handling routine affairs, it will discuss the expansion of the organization.

### Social Democratic Party Has Reached a Consensus on Participating in the Government

[Our Newspaper Report] The Social Democratic Party has reached a consensus on participating in the government after holding a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday. After the meeting, Zhang Junli, Wu Xianzi, and Xu Mengyan jointly issued the following announcement: "Our party has concrete opinions on the issue of reorganizing the government, which will be submitted to the government in the near future. Our party will decide its attitude after receiving a reply." It is also learned that the common opinions of the Social Democratic Party will be taken to Beijing by Secretary-General Lei Zhen today for the government's reference. According to speculation by relevant people, the content of the Social Democratic Party's opinions is nothing more than requesting the government to hold the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee as soon as possible and requesting non-Kuomintang members to serve as the Premier of the Executive Yuan, etc. However, after yesterday's meeting, it may be requested to open up local political power, but it will not be as insistent as the Youth Party. It is also possible that Jiang Yuntian will go to Beijing with Lei Zhen the day after tomorrow.

### Withdrawal of U.S. Military Personnel Stationed in China

House of Representatives Does Not Intend to Ask Marshal Marshall to Report, Senator's Proposal Has Been Rejected

[United Press Washington 4th Dispatch] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today unanimously rejected the proposal by Republican Senator Rogers requesting a detailed explanation of the U.S. decision to withdraw troops stationed in China.

### Debris of Missing Plane on the Guangzhou-Chongqing Line Found in Guizhou

[Central News Agency Chongqing 5th Dispatch] There is now a clue in the search for China Airlines flight No. 138 on the Chongqing-Guangzhou line, which has lasted for ten days.

### Treaties and Agreements Negotiated by Various Countries are All Aimed at the National Government. CCP's Denial of Treaty Declaration is Not Worth Paying Attention To

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] This New China News Agency released a Yan'an telegram, in which the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a statement on the 1st of this month, stating that it would not recognize any treaties or agreements signed by the National Government with foreign countries after January 10th of last year. Regarding this matter, the reporter explored reactions from all sides. According to a certain authority, foreigners have obtained more reliable information, saying that this move by the Communist Party was a pre-determined plan. After the U.S. government announced that the U.S. military would withdraw from China, the Communist Party believed that its anti-American propaganda policy had succeeded, so now, in addition to intensifying its military offensive against the National Government, it must try its best to show the Communist Party as an independent belligerent group in the international community, in order to arouse some kind of external intervention. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party has secretly ordered party members in various places within the jurisdiction of the National Government, who have public identities and significant past activities, to prepare to withdraw or go into complete hiding in the shortest possible time. On the one hand, it is using its peripheral gray elements to encourage unrest in various places to cooperate with its military moves. Moreover, before and after the withdrawal of prominent figures from the Communist Party, it is conspiring to launch riots in several large cities to strengthen the power of "anti-American" propaganda through action, and even claims that the date of the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty signed last year, November 4th, is a "National Humiliation Day" design. Therefore, the Communist Party Central Committee's statement on February 1 is an inevitable part of its agenda and is not worth paying attention to. The United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and all the United Nations currently recognize the National Government as the only legitimate government of the Republic of China. In addition to hoping that the National Government will expand its foundation and strengthen the democratic atmosphere, all negotiated treaties and agreements are always aimed at the National Government and will never change due to the Communist Party's unilateral statement.

### Lu Zhong Recovers Laiwu City, Communist Army Suffers Heavy Casualties and Losses, Remnants Flee South, Stalemate in Southern Shandong, Fierce Fighting Near Zaozhuang

[Our Newspaper Jinan 5th Dispatch] The battalion and one brigade and four regiments of the Laiwu Communist Army that retreated to 45 kilometers south of Boshan, the New Second Regiment of the Lu Zhong Military Region, and the New Third Regiment and the Laiwu Local Army, totaling more than 8,000 soldiers, were defeated and fled south after the National Army launched a courageous attack. The National Army officially recovered Laiwu City at 4 p.m. on the 4th. There was no fierce resistance from the Communist Army when entering the city. All the property in the city had been plundered by the Communist Army before the withdrawal. Bulky furniture and houses that were inconvenient to carry were also set on fire by the Communist Army. All the wells in the urban area were filled or destroyed. All the residents were also coerced by the Communist Army to leave. The National Army entered this plundered and empty city, and the food, beverages, and utensils were exhausted. Supplies were difficult to obtain, and landmines and explosives pre-buried by the Communist Army were everywhere. Engineers excavated no less than 300 locations. In the morning of the 5th, refugees from the surrounding countryside heard that the National Army had arrived, and many tried to escape. They described the brutal situation under the Communist Army's control, and everyone shed tears. The National Army is providing full assistance to enable them to regain their livelihoods.

[Central News Agency Jinan 5th Dispatch] The National Army advancing from Tusi Pass recovered Laiwu County on the 4th. The Ninth Division and Fourth Division of the Communist Army stationed there and a part of the New First Brigade suffered heavy casualties and losses. The remnants fled to the Yinyin direction.

The resistance of the Communist Army in various places was minimal, and they surrendered one after another.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 5th Dispatch] The battle situation in Southern Shandong is gradually becoming stalemate. The National Army is strengthening the pacification work.

### Liu Bocheng's Troops Suffered Heavy Losses

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 5th Dispatch] In order to support the Communist Army's rebellion in Southern Shandong, Liu Bocheng has launched an offensive against the Henan-Anhui border area in the past two weeks. Six columns of Liu's troops have recently left two columns in Western Shandong, and centered on Juye and Jiaxiang, they are wandering in the triangular area of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways in an attempt to contain the National Army and destroy local administrative organizations. In addition, its Sixth Column is active in the Longhai Railway border area south of Nanqiu and Dangshan, taking the opportunity to destroy the railway at any time. In addition, its Second, Third, and Fifth Columns are separately disrupting the territory of Qixian, Ningling, Zhecheng, and Hao County south of the Longhai Railway, attempting to unite with the Communist Army Wei Fenglou, Zhang Taisheng, and other troops, totaling about 50,000 people, who originally operated in Eastern Henan and Northern Anhui, to establish a new base area in the Henan-Anhui border area, and then connect with Western Shandong to form a new corridor across the Longhai Railway and the Xuzhou-Zhengzhou Pacification Zone. Then Liu Bocheng's troops can threaten Xuzhou in the east and Kaifeng in the west, but the military has proper countermeasures for the Communist Party's conspiracy.

### Northern Suburbs of Tancheng

[Our Newspaper Beiping 5th Dispatch] It is learned here that the Jin Communist Army launched a fierce attack on Wenshui County on the 1st. After several days of fierce fighting, the city finally fell on the afternoon of the 3rd. Initially, three regiments of Xue Yibo's troops of the Communist Army were found in Zihongkou near the county, with the intention of attacking the county. There was also a concentration of the Communist Army near Shouyang, east of Taiyuan. As the county was in a state of emergency, Governor Yan, in view of the tense situation on the outskirts of Taiyuan and the Communist Army's ultimate goal of attacking Taiyuan, decided to organize a protection group and mobilize all manpower and material resources in Taiyuan to arm itself for self-defense, which is now actively underway.

### Licheng Village, West of Pingyao City, Communist Army Flees to the Northwest

[Central News Agency Taiyuan 5th Dispatch] Although the Communist Army in Jin is constantly disrupting various places, it is obviously not attacking the center of gravity. The National Army is currently searching for its main force to expel it. The Independent Second Brigade of the Communist Army, about four regiments, and the troops on the right bank of the Fen River, occupying Licheng Village (20 kilometers west of Pingyao City), were almost completely destroyed by heavy artillery bombardment by the National Army.

### Minister Peng Answers Reporters' Inquiries: Newspaper Page Reduction is a Practical Necessity, Suppression of Yellow Journalism Based on Publication Law

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Information Department held a press conference on the afternoon of the 5th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei. The main questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Question: On what legal basis does the Information Department limit the size of newspapers? Does this restriction also apply to foreign language newspapers such as the Continental Daily? How much newsprint was imported last year and how much was used? Under normal pre-war circumstances, how much was needed annually? After the implementation of the restrictions, what is the estimated import quantity and foreign exchange required? Can the Minister tell us each of these figures? Does the Information Department and the Ministry of the Interior have other plans to restrict "yellow journalism"?

Answer: (1) The Ministry's temporary measures to reduce newspaper page size are based on the shortage of paper and the need to save foreign exchange, as well as the requests of most newspaper offices in Nanjing and Shanghai. After convening discussions, an agreement was reached. This measure has been notified to local newspaper associations for voluntary implementation. (2) Whether Western newspapers will reduce page size will also be decided by local newspaper associations. (3) From April to November of last year, the amount of newspaper imports was approximately 25 billion yuan in national currency, equivalent to approximately 11 million US dollars. If calculated for the whole year, it would be around 20 million US dollars. This number is actually five times the pre-war annual import value of 3.8 million US dollars, showing how much foreign exchange is being consumed. (4) The crackdown on so-called yellow journalism is entirely based on the Publication Law. Article 22 of the Publication Law explicitly stipulates that "publications shall not contain records that harm good morals." Article 34 of the same law stipulates that "if the content of a publication violates Article 22 and the circumstances are serious, the Ministry of the Interior or the local competent authority, after reporting to and obtaining approval from the Ministry of the Interior, may prohibit its sale and distribution, and may seize it when necessary.

If the aforementioned publication is a newspaper or magazine, its publication may be suspended for a fixed period.

Not Purchased from the US: Atomic Splitter

Question: The Central News Agency, on February 2nd, reprinted a dispatch from New York stating that the Academia Sinica is purchasing an atomic splitter from the United States for use in atomic experiments, and stated that China has uranium deposits. What steps is the government taking to study atomic energy, and how will it develop and control uranium mines? Can the Minister give a detailed account of the reserves and location of uranium mines?

Answer: The Academia Sinica has not purchased an atomic splitter. The government has not yet taken any major steps to study atomic energy. There is no precise survey of China's uranium deposits.

Question: In the proposed government reorganization plan, will the Information Department still be part of the Kuomintang, or will it be transferred to the government? Can the Minister provide details?

Answer: The Information Department is currently an organization of the Party, and it is also guided by the Executive Yuan. Whether there will be a similar organization in the future reorganized government is still unknown.

Question: After the implementation of constitutional government, will formal meetings of the legislative body be open to the public and the press?

Answer: The President of the Legislative Yuan has already agreed to allow you to attend the meetings. If any of you wish to attend, please inform the Foreign Affairs Section of this Ministry for liaison.

Question: What is the strength of the current Chinese army? Can it be divided into land, sea, and air forces? How many are involved in conflicts with the Communists, and how many are actively fighting and stationed on the front lines? What is the government's current estimate of the total strength of the Communist regular and irregular forces?

Answer: I am very sorry that I cannot answer. However, under the current circumstances, I cannot disclose such figures. (End)

### Subsidies for Recovered Counties and Cities in the Pacification Zone: Ministry of Finance Allocates Over 10 Billion; Gu Zhenggang Arrives in Beiping Yesterday with a Supervisory Team

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The recovered counties and cities in the pacification zones have no local tax revenue. The Ministry of Finance has allocated large sums of money to enable local institutions at all levels to maintain operations. The Executive Yuan has approved a total allocation of 13.5 billion yuan, of which 6.165 billion yuan has been allocated for recovery subsidies to various counties and cities, and 1.155 billion yuan for recovery reserves. The subsidy for experimental counties is 200 million yuan for Shandong, 200 million yuan for Hebei, and 400 million yuan for Jiangsu, totaling 8.12 billion yuan. The remaining 5.38 billion yuan will be allocated successively.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] The second team of the Pacification Zone Political and Military Security Corps, consisting of fourteen people, led by Gu Zhenggang, arrived in Beiping by special plane at 1 p.m. on the 5th. The remaining members of the team are scheduled to arrive north on the 7th. According to Minister Gu, Chairman Chiang is very concerned about the people in the pacification zones. Therefore, he dispatched the security corps to various places to express condolences. In addition, the important task of the supervisory team is to inspect the local conditions of the pacification zones and supervise the implementation of various government orders. Whether the past policies of the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee are suitable for the local conditions will also be thoroughly studied during this inspection. Gu said: The second team will be divided into two working groups. One group, led by Qiu Changwei, will go to Chahar and Suiyuan to work, and the other group will go to eastern Hebei, central Hebei, and northern Shanxi to work. The duration is expected to be about two months. He personally plans to inspect various important areas for three weeks. Minister Gu finally answered reporters' questions, saying that the government has allocated large sums of money to provide relief to the people in the pacification zones. The total amount has reached 300 billion yuan. Although it cannot completely solve the lives of the disaster victims, sending goose feathers from a thousand miles away is enough to show the government's concern for the people.

[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 5th] The Jiangsu North Group of the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Supervisory Team arrived in Taizhou. Last night at 9 p.m., a symposium was held in the county government meeting room to gather various county agencies and legal entities, listen to the work reports of the heads, and raise various difficulties. The commissioners answered them. Finally, Team Leader Qing delivered a speech, pointing out the key points. The meeting adjourned at 11 p.m. This morning at 8 a.m., they left Taizhou by special car.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of the Interior, upon the order of the Executive Yuan, has abolished the "Important Points for Paying Attention to the Implementation of Joint Guarantees and Joint Liability in Various Places During Extraordinary Times," which was promulgated on February 25, 1938. If it is necessary to implement joint guarantees and joint liability in various pacification zones, counties, and cities, they can formulate implementation measures in accordance with the provisions of the "Important Points for Strict Baojia System in Recovered Provinces and Cities" promulgated by the Ministry, and report to the Ministry for approval in order to meet actual needs. The Ministry has now telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense and the provincial and municipal governments to investigate and notify their subordinates.

### Japanese War Criminal Tani Hisao: Public Trial Begins in Nanjing; Film of His Atrocities Shown Simultaneously

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Tani Hisao, the main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, began his public trial at the Lishi Society Auditorium at 2 p.m. on the 6th. The courtroom has been arranged, and 1,000 spectator tickets have been issued. During the trial, films of Tani's atrocities taken by the Japanese army and American reporters will be shown. The remains unearthed at Yuhuatai a few days ago will also be brought to court as evidence, and the forensic doctor will report on the autopsy process.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Colonel Yang Jianbai, the person in charge of the war criminal detention center of the Ministry of National Defense, told visiting reporters: There are currently seven war criminals, five of whom are lieutenant generals: (1) Takahashi Tan (former Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in North China), (2) Uchida Takayuki (former Commander of the Japanese 70th Division), (3) Tani Hisao (the main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre), (4) Tani Kosuke (former Japanese Governor of Hong Kong), (5) Tsuchihashi Yuitsu (Army Commander). Tani Hisao has been in Nanjing for more than two months since he came from Shanghai. When he entered the prison, Tani said, "I used to be wrong about China, but now I understand." He writes a diary every day. I think Tani's words must not be from the bottom of his heart. Looking at his awkward face when he was quibbling about his crimes, how could he admit his mistakes? Colonel Yang also talked about the daily lives of the war criminals. He first talked about the principles of management: treating the war criminals with a broad mind and giving them preferential treatment, and managing the war criminals with strict methods. Their staple and non-staple foods are the same as those of our officers and soldiers. Although prices are high, we try our best to provide reasonable nutrition. They are released for walks every day in the morning and afternoon, and the remaining time is used for war criminals to take baths and change clothes, so there are no lice in the detention center. (Tani's indictment omitted)

### Luo Junqiang to be Retried

Punishment of Perpetrators and Compensation Under Negotiation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] A conflict occurred between the Dutch and Indonesian armies in Palembang, southern Sumatra Island, resulting in heavy losses of life and property for our overseas Chinese.

Editorial

### Another Absurd Statement by the Chinese Communists

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) "Central Committee" issued an absurd statement on February 1, with two main points: (1) The Political Consultative Conference (PCC) is the highest political body in China, recognized by the people of the country and the world powers. All important domestic and foreign affairs that must be approved by the parliament in other democratic countries should be agreed upon by this conference before they can be considered valid. (2) All agreements and understandings reached by the National Government with the world powers in diplomatic negotiations after January 10, 1946, that have not been approved by the Political Consultative Conference, the CCP will not recognize now or in the future, nor will it bear any obligations. After reading this statement, we feel that it is meaningless and childishly ridiculous in both law and fact, and not worth refuting. However, studying the intentions of the CCP in issuing this statement, we have to point out that this is another proof of the CCP's attempt to seize territory by force.

What we find most surprising is that the CCP actually regards the Political Consultative Conference as the highest political organization in our country. On this point, the editorial of this newspaper has repeatedly pointed out the nature of the Political Consultative Conference. It is a political measure to resolve partisan disputes, a political meeting in which all parties exchange opinions and obtain common conclusions, but it is by no means an institution representing public opinion, let alone the highest political organization in our country. How can it be compared with the parliaments of other democratic countries? This is one point. The National Government is the only legitimate government recognized by the people of the country and the world powers. Its negotiations with the world powers and the resulting agreements or treaties, as long as they are handled through legal procedures, can take effect. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor bear the obligations stipulated in the treaty. The CCP's statement almost makes people suspect that the CCP is not a political party organized by the people of the Republic of China. We must remind all levels of society that today China has only one legitimate government, and that is the National Government. No matter how the National Government is reorganized in the future, before the constitution is implemented, China is still in the process of building a nation through the Three Principles of the People, that is, still in the period of tutelage under the Kuomintang. Any treaties it concludes with the world powers can take effect as long as they are handled in accordance with the procedures prescribed by current laws. The Chinese people and any political party have no reason to refuse to recognize or bear treaty obligations. This is the second point.

The CCP is not ignorant of the above two points, but why does it try to fool the people with all its might? The reason is obvious. Since the United States announced the abandonment of mediation and the withdrawal of US troops back to the country, the CCP has gloated, believing that its anti-American propaganda has been successful. In the future, for the National Government, in addition to intensifying the offensive militarily, it will look for new topics in propaganda to confuse international public opinion, in an attempt to gain the recognition of the world powers as an independent belligerent party, thereby weakening the National Government's international status and reputation, and thus provoking international intervention. This is truly an unspeakable "self-inflicted injury" strategy. The CCP only knows the interests of one party and one person, and does not hesitate to put the country and the nation in a place of death. How can it gain the sympathy and support of the people of the country? Therefore, we are not only worried about the future of China, but also feel sorry for the future of the CCP.

According to a telegram from our newspaper's Nanjing correspondent on the 5th, reliable information obtained from foreign sources stated that the CCP "Central Committee" has secretly ordered CCP members in various regions under the jurisdiction of the National Government to use their peripheral gray elements to instigate disturbances and even launch riots, using actions to strengthen anti-American propaganda. It is heard that the CCP has designated November 4, the date of the signing of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty, as China's new "National Humiliation Day." Judging from this news, it is known that the CCP "Central Committee" is really harboring extreme malicious intentions in issuing this statement. From these clues, it is not difficult to find a clue to prove that the CCP's intentions are really too vicious. All the current actions of the CCP are pretentious, trying to threaten the United States, forcing the United States to completely withdraw from China; at the same time, it is wantonly propagating in the international community in order to weaken the position of the Chinese National Government, thereby provoking international intervention in China's internal strife. But can this trick achieve its purpose? We dare to boldly say that China and foreign countries see very clearly the consistent methods adopted by the CCP. It will never fall for its tricks, so all parties do not attach importance to the statement issued by the CCP on February 1. It only feels childish and laughable.

In short, the domestic situation has developed to this point, and it is absolutely not enough for the people who are the masters of the country to merely express heartache or empty calls for peace to reverse the tide. Although we people are all kind people without power and courage, but now that things have come to this, we can no longer not stand up and make a solemn representation to the political parties that are willing to destroy the country's reputation and status, and we can no longer tolerate their irresponsible remarks. We only know that today China has only one legitimate government, and all treaties signed by it with the world powers in accordance with legal procedures are valid. We only hope that the National Government will reorganize as soon as possible, expand its base, and increase the democratic atmosphere. Do not delay due to the CCP's obstruction, so as not to harm the overall situation of the country. In addition, we must warn all levels of society across the country that they must never be mistakenly trapped in the CCP's trap of ruining the country's peace and unity again.

### Subsidies and Surcharges on Foreign Exchange

Yesterday, the Supreme National Defense Council resolved that, in order to encourage exports, the government will provide a subsidy of 100% of the export price for foreign exchange settlements on exported goods, and impose a surcharge of 50% ad valorem on specified types of imported goods. The implication is that the export exchange rate will be 6.700 yuan, part of the import exchange rate will be 5.025 yuan, and the remaining part will remain at 3.350 yuan. In other words, the foreign exchange rate has not changed, but all exported goods and some imported goods will be given different exchange rates through subsidies and surcharges, and these exchange rates have been increased by 50% to 100%. The gains and losses of this matter can be observed from two aspects.

(1) The Timing of the Adjustment
The authorities have been constantly clarifying rumors about foreign exchange adjustments. Just the day before yesterday, there were still clarification news reports. Unexpectedly, the method of subsidies and surcharges was suddenly decided yesterday and scheduled to be implemented starting today. This seems to be questionable in terms of the government's credibility. However, those who clarify clarify, and those who spread rumors spread rumors. Market speculation and trouble-making do not stop because of clarifications. Some even misrepresent facts, spreading unfounded rumors, which only intensifies the rumor-mongering. Therefore, the authorities' decisive action and prompt decision may not be a wise move. Because a timely decision can at least clarify the atmosphere and stabilize the market.

(2) The Degree of Adjustment
Yesterday, the black market rate for US dollars had already reached 9,500 yuan. Now, the government promises to subsidize the export exchange rate by 100%, which is actually only 6,700 yuan. From the perspective of exporters, this is certainly not considered completely satisfactory. Whether overseas remittances from various places can all be turned over to the government and no longer evaded remains a question.

As for some imported goods, their costs will increase due to the implementation of surcharges, and their competitiveness will naturally weaken, which can provide a lot of help to the sales of domestic products. However, we know that to promote exports, regardless of other conditions, it is necessary to ensure that the price of such goods is at least equal to the price of goods from other countries in the foreign market in order to compete with others. Furthermore, in order to restrict foreign goods, regardless of other conditions, it is also necessary to ensure that the price of such goods in the domestic market is not lower than that of domestic products, so as to prevent dumping. In other words, if the price of exported goods is too high and the price of imported goods is too low, it will be impossible to promote domestic goods and defend against foreign goods. Therefore, if we do not talk about trade policy, then so be it. But if we must encourage exports and control imports, then the rate of subsidies and surcharges should not be determined solely subjectively, but should be based on the prices in the foreign and domestic markets as a standard for adjustment. For example, if the market price of a certain export product abroad is 100,000 in foreign currency, but its cost is 120,000, then it is of course impossible to compete with others under this situation. Now, if a subsidy is given on the exchange rate, it must be subsidized to the point where the selling price can be reduced to 100,000 or less in order to achieve the expected goal. If the amount of the subsidy is too small and the cost is still above 100,000, then the exporter will still lose money, and the export of the goods will still be impossible to promote. The same is true for imported goods. If surcharges are used to restrict their dumping, the surcharge must be increased to the point where it is impossible to compete at a low price, that is, the selling price must at least be equal to the market price of domestic goods in order to offset their dumping power. Therefore, whether the numbers of 100% subsidy and 50% surcharge are appropriate remains to be proven by facts.

Currently, prices in the United States are showing a downward trend, while prices in our country are still gradually rising. If this situation cannot be changed, then the subsidies obtained on foreign exchange will still be offset by this price difference. This point must also be given careful attention.

Every time the foreign exchange rate is adjusted, the value of the legal tender is devalued once. Although this has its necessary reasons in international trade, it is still regrettable in terms of the credit of the national currency. Moreover, the lower the currency value, the weaker the savings, the stronger the mentality of speculation and hoarding, and the more dramatic the fluctuations in general prices. The impact of this is that the wage-earning class becomes more unstable, industrial and commercial accounting lacks certainty, and the government is unable to balance its income and expenditure. Simply put, the entire national economy will be affected by this unstable exchange rate. Therefore, we express our deep sympathy from the perspective of international trade for this disguised adjustment. But for the stability of foreign exchange and currency value, we have even more ardent expectations.

The Fortress Command has issued Jiangfang Essentials to various counties, stating that if Communist bandits forcibly cross the river, all warning units should make every effort to wipe them out and not allow them to flee southward. The county magistrates of all counties along the Yangtze River should supervise the self-defense teams of all subordinate townships and towns to set up observation posts at all Yangtze River ports and send patrols to maintain strict vigilance. If Communist bandits sneak across and enter the jurisdiction, the county magistrates and township chiefs should immediately report the bandit situation and take appropriate action.

### Strengthening Local Military Forces, Strictly Prohibiting the Theft and Sale of Bullets, Huaiyin County Government Reorganizes Self-Defense Forces

[Report from Huaiyin] Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu have broken up into smaller groups, gone underground, and are taking the opportunity to cause disturbances, harming the local area. The Huaiyin County Government has specifically ordered the self-defense teams in each district to strictly guard against bandits, not to stay in one place for too long, to increase vigilance, and to act mobilely. In order to strengthen the local military force and thoroughly [eliminate] the remaining bandits, they must follow the stipulated organization and complete the reorganization within a time limit. Furthermore, recently there have been unscrupulous merchants entering bandit areas to sell live pigs and other goods, and the bandits are taking advantage of them, collecting firearms and ammunition in lieu of taxes. Therefore, merchants are often using the name of the township office to [purchase] real bullets in order to profit. There is concern that some unscrupulous officers and soldiers may be blinded by greed, stealing and selling bullets, not only violating discipline but also strengthening the bandits' strength. This must be strictly prohibited. The consumption of bullets by the township offices in each district is strictly limited to prevent abuses.

### Qiantang River Bridge Partially Opened, Government Vehicles Allowed to Pass Starting Today

Commercial and Private Vehicles Will Begin to Pass Next Month

[Report from Hangzhou, 5th] Mr. Mao Yisheng came to Hangzhou last night to discuss matters concerning the Qiantang River Bridge and the Seawall Engineering Bureau. The Qiantang River Bridge, which is widely anticipated, will begin accepting applications tomorrow and will implement a semi-open policy. Government vehicles from various agencies can obtain passes from the Engineering Office to pass. As for the passage of commercial and private vehicles, it will be officially opened from March 1st. The management station and telephone still need to be rebuilt, and the lights have been partially Pei sent, costing more than 4 million. However, after the bridge is opened, the number of cars passing through will be in the hundreds, with an average toll of 10,000 yuan per vehicle, which can generate a monthly income of 90 million. The monthly train fare on the Zhugan Railway is about 100 million yuan.

### Executive Headquarters Issues Written Report Explaining the Quantity of Supplies Provided by UNRRA to China and the Distribution of Supplies by the Executive Headquarters

[This City News] The Executive Headquarters spokesman recently issued a written report explaining the quantity of supplies provided by UNRRA to China and the distribution of supplies by the Executive Headquarters last year (1946). It is said that: "UNRRA's total budget for China is 647,500,000 US dollars. Among them, 535,000,000 US dollars are various relief supplies, and the remaining 112,500,000 US dollars are the ocean freight for transporting supplies to China. In the classified budget for UNRRA's supplies to China, industrial and transportation equipment ranks first, with 174,500,000 US dollars; food ranks second, with 133,500,000 US dollars; clothing ranks third, with 95,900,000 US dollars; agricultural equipment ranks fourth, with 86,000,000 US dollars; medical equipment ranks last, with 39,700,000 US dollars. There is also 5,400,000 US dollars for reserves. Last year (1946), 315,000,000 US dollars of supplies were transported to China, so there are still 217,000,000 US dollars of supplies to continue to be transported to China this year.

Among the countries receiving UNRRA assistance, China received the most supplies. We sincerely thank the people of the United Nations for their assistance to China after the war, but China has a vast territory, a large population, and suffered terribly for eight years. Allocating more than 500 million US dollars of supplies to China is still like a drop in the bucket. The distribution of UNRRA supplies is limited to the recovered provinces that have suffered from war. If we calculate the 300 million population of the recovered provinces, the average benefit per person is only 1.7 US dollars. In fact, not everyone in the recovered areas needs relief, and most of the post-disaster supplies are used for public works and are not distributed to any private individuals. However, the average of 1.7 dollars is sufficient to show that the amount of UNRRA supplies to China is limited. In 1944, the United States' war expenses averaged 290,000,000 US dollars per day. UNRRA supplied China with 535 million US dollars of supplies, which is less than two days of war expenses in the United States. We are not dissatisfied with the amount of UNRRA's supply. UNRRA's strength is limited to this and has made the greatest contribution to China. We hope that people in the recovered areas will pay attention to the actual quantity of UNRRA supplies to China and further understand the basic reason why supplies are insufficient for distribution.

Although the UNRRA supplies to China are limited in terms of distribution, they are very heavy in terms of transportation, assembly, and handling.

From the beginning of the Executive Headquarters' operations to December 28th of last year, the Executive Headquarters received a total of 1,348,586 tons of UNRRA supplies (referring to those formally transferred). Among them, food accounted for 60%, transportation equipment accounted for 11%, clothing accounted for 9%, agricultural equipment accounted for 4%, industrial equipment accounted for 2%, medical equipment accounted for 1%, and the rest were various miscellaneous supplies. Of the above supplies, 651,000 tons were transported to various branch offices before December 28th. The regional distribution is as follows:

Hunan 126,316.88 tons

Zhejiang 20,616.62 tons

Shanghai 28,721.95 tons

Jin-Cha-Sui 15,154.53 tons

Hebei 31,544.80 tons

Fujian 17,280.81 tons

Shandong 21,900.07 tons

Northeast Nine Provinces 16,020.86 tons

Henan 53,238.35 tons

Anhui 28,710.59 tons

Guangdong 62,910.05 tons

Taiwan 45,224.04 tons

Hubei 38,145.05 tons

Jiangxi 25,532.85 tons

Jiangsu Nanjing 57,919.88 tons

Guangxi 61,683.46 tons

Hunan received more supplies because of the most severe disaster. The next three provinces are Henan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. The least amount of supplies was transported to the Northeast because local order has not been restored and transportation has been disrupted.

In addition to those transported to various branch offices, before December 28th of last year, the Executive Headquarters transferred 230,000 tons of equipment to relevant government ministries and commissions (such as the various railway bureaus of the Ministry of Transportation) and issued them to affiliated institutions of the Executive Headquarters (such as the Executive Headquarters Highway Brigade, Water Transport Brigade, and Machinery Factory). As of December 28th, only about 90,000 tons of supplies were in warehouses in Shanghai and Hong Kong that had not been transported to the mainland, and the rest were in transit at that time.

Of the total amount of UNRRA supplies received last year, about 210,000 tons of various supplies were sold by the Executive Headquarters to various public and private organizations. This sale was based on the basic agreement signed between the National Government and UNRRA. The proceeds from the sale were used entirely for relief expenses. Countries that accept UNRRA assistance around the world have signed treaties with UNRRA to sell a portion of their supplies as relief funds. The treaty signed between China and UNRRA also has similar provisions."

### U.S. Representative Presents Disarmament Compromise to Security Council, Advocating for Priority Discussion of Atomic Control; Soviet Representative Gromyko Expresses Dissent, Leading to Heated Debate

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 4th] U.S. Representative Austin today presented a compromise proposal to the Security Council in an attempt to reconcile the differing opinions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding the disarmament issue. The U.S. proposal consists of: (1) Establishing a Disarmament Commission; (2) Establishing a special committee to study the recommendations made by the Disarmament Commission; (3) Considering the report of the Atomic Energy Commission at the next meeting. Austin also stated that the United States is bound by the principle of international collective security, and therefore the United States insists that any disarmament plan must first take into account practical security plans. Before fulfilling disarmament obligations, United Nations members must first be assured that such practical security plans can be effectively implemented. The U.S. government firmly believes that international control of atomic energy, including provisions for sanctions against those who violate the control, is a fundamental condition for establishing international peace and security, and for limiting and reducing other weapons. The United States has learned from the painful experience of unilateral disarmament after World War I, and has therefore decided not to repeat the same mistake. In response to the new U.S. proposal, Soviet Representative Gromyko stated that the Soviet Union had already proposed the establishment of a Disarmament Commission in December of last year, so the first item of the U.S. proposal is not new, and the second proposal also seems unnecessary. The United Nations General Assembly already has regulations regarding the work plan of the commission, so establishing a special committee would only delay the work of the Disarmament Commission. Regarding the third item, he also felt it was unnecessary, as the report of the Atomic Energy Commission has already been included in the Security Council's agenda and will be discussed in turn. As for the U.S. statement that it is inconvenient to implement disarmament without effective guarantees, it cannot help but make people suspect whether the United States trusts the United Nations organization and the provisions of its Charter. If the provisions of the Charter are insufficient to guarantee security, then the foundation of the United Nations organization is fundamentally flawed, and then we should rebuild the United Nations organization.

### Organization of Five-Nation Working Group to Draft Disarmament Regulations; China Expresses Full Support for U.S. Proposal

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 4th] Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative to the Security Council, expressed his support for the U.S. representative's proposed resolution to establish a Disarmament Commission and to discuss the report of the Atomic Energy Commission on a regular basis, and said that the Chinese delegation would fully support it. Australian Representative Hasluck also gave a speech stating that Australia had already submitted a draft resolution on the disarmament issue, but now the U.S. representative is proposing to prioritize the discussion of the atomic energy issue, which delays the discussion of the disarmament issue. The Australian delegation cannot agree with this. The U.S. representative's proposal to establish a special committee is also redundant. He expressed his strong agreement with what Soviet Representative Gromyko said, and proposed the organization of a committee to draft a joint proposal aimed at bringing the Security Council to a consensus. British Representative Jebb seconded the U.S. representative's proposal to organize a special committee. Finally, U.S. Representative Austin proposed that a committee be organized by the five nations of the U.S., the Soviet Union, France, Australia, and Colombia to draft a joint proposal in accordance with Australia's suggestion.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 5th] The Security Council's five-nation drafting committee is about to meet to discuss the regulations of the Disarmament Commission. There are currently two major trends. First, if serious problems arise, neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union intends to use their veto power, which is undoubtedly an optimistic factor for future negotiations. Second, the representatives participating in the negotiations should establish an agreement on the military, which will be submitted to the Security Council for adoption to maintain peace. So far, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union have remained silent on this point.

### U.S. Determined to Fully Support United Nations Organization; President Submits Report to Congress Reviewing the Past Year's Work

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: President Truman submitted a 30,000-word first report on United Nations activities in 1946 to Congress, stating that the United Nations organization is proceeding smoothly, but the world's hopes and beliefs in the organization still have the possibility of being betrayed and lost, and that the issue of atomic energy control has not yet been resolved. Truman was proud of the United States' leading position in various sectors. He also stated that there are many obstacles to international problems, but the prospects for the world peace organization are very promising. "Due to the authority and power given to us by history and resources, the United States bears a particularly heavy responsibility. The development of the world situation is of deeper concern to the United States than to any other country." Truman urged the Republican-controlled Congress to provide the same bipartisan support for U.S. foreign policy. Truman said: "In various activities of the United Nations, our policies must be based on a bipartisan position and implemented effectively, not only in the political field, but also in the economic and social fields. Regarding issues such as world economic construction and world trade expansion, we must implement economic cooperation with other countries." Truman said that the work of the United Nations in the past year was to lay the foundation, and there are many obstacles ahead that must be removed in order to achieve the goals of peacefully resolving international disputes, establishing collective security, controlling atomic energy, promoting economic recovery, expanding the world economy, and guaranteeing human rights. The future policy of the United States will fully support the United Nations, not as an expedient measure, but as a permanent policy.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] U.S. Senate President and Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Vandenberg recently stated that he does not intend to go to Moscow to attend the four-nation foreign ministers conference. He has had a "frank discussion" with President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall. He is busy with congressional duties, so he has to stay in Washington, but this does not mean that the bipartisan foreign policy has broken down. He still relies on the continued success of this bipartisan policy. He will maintain regular contact with Marshall and, if necessary, can go to Moscow to work with him on everything. Democratic Senator Connally, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that he does not intend to attend the four-nation foreign ministers conference because he is preoccupied with congressional duties, but if the President and Secretary of State ask him to go, then he will go to Moscow.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] It has been learned that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to hold his first press conference at 8:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on the 7th of this month.

### Arson Case Re-investigation, Questioning for Seven Hours; Disaster Victim Zheng Zaijian and Others Should Be Summoned to the Case; Court Orders Team Leader Li Xun to Be Released on Bail

[Report from this newspaper] In the Ximo Road fire case, the District Prosecutor's Office is actively investigating. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Wang Yunfu's daughter, Wang Chuaiqin, and Jin Zhengxuexiang, Zheng Zaijian, and Ju Jin Fang were summoned, as well as the fire brigade leader Li Xun, who was once detained, and fire personnel Wu Yiyong and Zhu Qinghui. At the same time, the detained suspected firefighters Huang Binqi, Shang Zhikui, Dai Rongxian, Li Chengjuan, and Cai Zhiying were also brought to court for questioning. The investigating prosecutor, Shen Zushou, arrived in court at 9:00 AM and began separate interrogations. The first interrogation was of Li Xun. Prosecutor Shen used a complex interrogation method, repeatedly questioning in circles to make the interrogated reveal the truth or show flaws unconsciously, so it took a lot of time. By noon, only Li Xun and Wu Yiyong had been questioned. After a short break at noon, Prosecutor Shen quickly finished his meal and continued the hearing. The summoned victims told the prosecutor as much as possible about the situation on the day of the disaster, and then the five detained firefighters were closely interrogated. Everything from taking advantage of the fire to rob, extorting gold bars, ineffective fire fighting, robbing fluorescent lamps, towels, cotton sweaters and other sundries, the loss of gold bars and ornaments from Wang Yunfu's home, the wardrobe being chopped up, the rubber hose being placed in the tile pile, how the U.S. military assisted in firefighting, etc., was questioned in detail, including human evidence, physical evidence, and the relationship in time. The interrogation continued for seven hours and did not end until 4:00 PM. Except for the five original detained firefighters who were still detained, only Li Xun was released on bail among those summoned yesterday. All the others were ordered to return. The picture on the left shows Wu Yiyong (front) and Zhu Qingrun (back) being summoned for interrogation (taken by this newspaper).

### Fire Chief Complains; Lack of Equipment, Lack of Funds; Difficulties Abound

Low Quality Due to Unstable Life

[Report from this newspaper] After the Ximo Road fire case occurred, questions arose one after another. There were many doubts about the causes of the fire spreading and the fire rekindling after it was extinguished, as well as the reasons for allowing it to burn for 13 hours. The police department has not yet released a report on the handling of this case. The Fire Investigation Committee specially convened reporters from various newspapers at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 11:00 AM yesterday and invited Fire Chief Zhou Zhaoxiang to attend the report. Fire Chiefs Wang Wentao, Ye Binyong, and Xie Zhisu gave detailed reports on the handling of the fire that day, the causes of the spread, and the situation of the permanent fire, and also explained the dereliction of duty of the firefighters.

Chief Zhou first said: The occurrence of the Ximo Road fire has caused heavy losses to the people and the concern of public opinion. Those engaged in firefighting are extremely ashamed. It is really difficult to improve the firefighting facilities in Shanghai. At present, there are so many illegal buildings, so fires are easy to start. The roads are narrow and the vehicles are crowded, which makes it time-consuming for fire trucks to drive, and the water pressure is too low on weekdays, so it is not enough to fight fires. In addition, there is a lack of hydrants, which is not enough for convergence. According to the calculation of Shanghai's population of more than 4 million, 43 fire zones and 13,000 hydrants and more than 200 fire trucks are needed. However, the current fire department in this city has a total of nine districts, only more than 3,000 hydrants in the city, and 35 fire trucks. The hose is even worse. There are not enough to bear 80 pounds of pressure, less than one-fifth of the total. In the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, fire protection facilities have only been consumed, not added, and the degree of damage can be seen from this.

Regarding the character of the firefighters, I believe that they must have a particularly noble character to be qualified to take on firefighting work. In the past, firefighters had good treatment and a good life. It was easy to talk about integrity. But at present, the treatment is poor (the current firefighters' treatment is generally around 14 yuan), and the result of unstable life is that the quality of firefighters has gradually declined, but no matter what, statistically, in the 1063 fire alarms last year, I asked myself that I was not ashamed of the country.

Regarding the funding, the amount passed by the Senate was 1 billion yuan, but in fact, the Municipal Government only received a notice of 500 million yuan, and it has not yet been received. The first 500 million yuan allocated from the enemy and puppet industry was used to order 99,000 feet of hose, two high-pressure truck pumps, and fire parts from the United States in November last year, which will arrive in May. Because fire tools must be supplied to foreign countries, and the funding is so tight, we have to carefully maintain the existing old items, and the firefighters' contribution in this area cannot be erased. The U.S. military's belts are never washed after use, and a new one can be replaced the second time, while our belts have been used for eight or nine years and must be washed every time they are used.

Chief Zhou also emphasized: At present, the firefighters' work morale is very poor. None of the team leaders in the nine districts want to escape.

During the era of the Concessions, each firefighter could get a set of fire suits, a leather helmet, a pair of rubber boots, a cap (with a badge), a single overcoat, a leather belt, an ax, a pair of leather boots, a pair of running shoes, two sets of work clothes, 21 buttons, five pairs of numbers, a white shirt and white pants, and a wardrobe. What the current firefighters have is similar to the quantity in the past, but the quality is very different, and they are all old items from the past few years, so there are many patches on the clothes.

### The Cold Weather on the Night of the Fire Hindered Rescue Efforts

Following the fire at Seymour Road, the fire department conducted a detailed investigation with the meteorological department, water and electricity companies, and various district teams, and submitted the following comprehensive report yesterday: According to the records of the Observatory, the weather was extremely cold on the night of the fire. The temperature at 9:00 PM was 15 degrees Celsius, and it dropped to zero degrees by midnight. The cold weather undoubtedly affected the rescue work. According to a handbook published by the U.S. Fire Defense Association, cold weather accounted for the majority of the 163 fire accidents that occurred in the United States the year before last.

According to the statistics of the water and electricity company, the water consumption on that day was 9,158,800 gallons. The water pressure on Zhejiang Road was as low as 17 pounds and as high as 21 pounds. The water and electricity company increased the water pressure to 40 pounds after receiving notification at 11:25 PM. According to common practice, a water pressure of 30 pounds can reach 60 feet, which should be no problem for extinguishing fires in one-story buildings. However, the fire had already spread, making it difficult to control.

No Damage to Fire Hydrants

According to the statistics of the fire department, there was no damage to the fire hydrants near the scene of the fire. The American army's claim is completely inaccurate. The reason why the nearby hydrants were not used was to maintain the equipment. Because the hydrants on Wuding Road were close to the fire scene, the fire trucks could be in danger. Furthermore, the two hydrants (Nos. 1246 and 1245) on North Shaanxi Road (i.e., Seymour Road) north of Xinzha Road were outdated and only had a narrow diameter of 2.5 inches, while the suction pipes used by the fire department were 5 inches wide, so they could not be used. In addition, due to the limited supply from the underground water pipes, the hydrants located in the middle became ineffective after the ones on both sides were used.

According to the fire department's usual practice, only one fire truck is dispatched for ordinary fires. Two fire trucks are dispatched for fires in factories, hotels, and theaters, or when a fire is reported from a watchtower. Whether to continue to send reinforcements depends on the report from the first truck. Due to the intensity of the fire on Seymour Road, fire trucks from various district teams arrived at the scene, totaling nine vehicles. The fire department has accurate records of the gasoline supply and water pumping conditions of each vehicle. After investigation, each vehicle requested refueling from the district team headquarters, and all vehicles except No. 46 pumped water for at least four hours or more.

Comparison with the Era of the Municipal Council

A comparison of the current fire preparedness with that of the era of the Municipal Council can be seen roughly in the amount of funding allocated. In the era of the former Municipal Council, the fire department's budget accounted for 4% to 5% of the total administrative expenses. The current fire department's budget accounts for only 0.5%. In terms of personnel, there is not much difference. The former British Concession fire department had 83 officers and 658 police officers, and the French Concession had 10 officers and 200 police officers. The current police bureau's fire department has 43 officers, plus 62 fire brigade members, which is 12 more than in the era of the former Municipal Council. The total number of police officers is 797, which is 50 fewer than before.

### Tenants of Petain Apartments Appeal: Property Should Revert to the Executive Yuan for Use; Authorities Order Relocation by the End of the Month

[Report from our Newspaper] Housing disputes are constantly emerging in the lumber market. Recently, residents of the Petain Apartments at No. 700 Hengshan Road, forced to relocate by the Central Trust Bureau's enemy and puppet property clearing office, have had lawyer Yan Chen Ting appeal to the Executive Yuan, the municipal government, the municipal council, and the Central Trust Bureau. According to reports: the properties were originally enemy property, owned by German expatriates, with seven tenant households who have lived there for years. After the victory, the property rights were taken over by our government, and all tenants continued to reside there as usual, with rent collected monthly by the Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau. Three months ago, the Central Trust Bureau sent a letter to all tenants, stating that the apartment would soon be auctioned off, and tenants interested in purchasing it could submit bids to the bureau. In view of the severe housing shortage in Shanghai, all tenants, after a meeting, replied that they were willing to purchase it and requested priority rights. The Central Trust Bureau replied that they would be notified when a decision was made to sell it by auction. Unexpectedly, on the 30th of last month, four armed individuals, carrying an official letter from the Enemy Property Clearing Office, stated that the apartment was ordered to be used by the Executive Yuan and ordered them to relocate by the end of the month, otherwise the competent authorities would force them to relocate. All tenants believe that such handling by the authorities is a broken promise and have decided to fight for their rights.

### Three District Heads Elected in Putuo, Jiangning, and Xincheng Districts One After Another

Zheng Meikui, Wu Zhongda, Wang Jian'e, and others were elected

[Report from our Newspaper] The Putuo District's popularly elected district head election was held on the morning of the 5th at Jin Yuan Middle School on Jiangning Road. Sixty-two district representatives attended. Zheng Meikui (pictured) was elected district head with 20 votes, and Sha Enpu was elected deputy district head with 20 abstentions. Zheng was originally the deputy district head of the district and has been in office for over a year, with generally good public sentiment. Sha is said to be a well-known lawyer.

The Jiangning District's popularly elected district head election was also held yesterday. Wu Zhongda was elected district head with 35 votes, and Zhou Haoming was elected deputy district head with 30 votes.

The 11th District, Xincheng District, held its district head election at Yucai Middle School on the 4th. As a result, Wang Jian'e was elected district head with 107 votes, and Chen Yu was elected deputy district head with 91 votes. However, Wang Jian'e is a member of the Municipal Council. The Ministry of the Interior originally stipulated that appointed district heads could not concurrently serve as members of the Municipal Council. Now that Wang Jian'e is a popularly elected district head, whether he can concurrently serve as a member of the Municipal Council is still a question. The Department of Civil Affairs plans to submit a request to the Ministry of the Interior for clarification.

### A Young Woman's Vanity Caused Great Pain and Suffering; Nine Surgeries for Breast Inflammation; Tracing the Source of the Misfortune and Suing the Doctor

[Report from our Newspaper] Zheng Xiuhong, a 28-year-old woman from Ningbo, residing at No. 33, Lane 37, Changning Road, naturally loved beauty and often complained that her breasts were not developed enough. On September 2nd of last year, she went to the Shi Plastic Surgery Clinic at No. 205, Lane 587, Jing'an Temple Road for treatment. The clinic's owner, Shi Shuanghu, claimed that injections could enhance the beauty of the lines. Zheng paid two taels of gold in advance for the injections and treatment. Unexpectedly, a week later, she suddenly found inflammation in her breasts. By September 20th, the inflammation had not subsided. Shi Shuanghu said that surgery was necessary. One surgery was ineffective, so a second surgery was performed. This happened again and again, for a total of six surgeries by the end of October. Shi then left Shanghai for Hong Kong on October 30th. Zheng, ashamed to seek treatment elsewhere, continued to be treated by the female assistant at Shi's Plastic Surgery Clinic, who performed three consecutive surgeries. After nine surgeries, not only did she not recover, but her condition worsened. On November 23rd, she went to the Gongli Hospital for treatment, but electrotherapy was also ineffective. The hospital's doctors diagnosed that it would be difficult to recover without a major operation. With Zheng's consent, another surgery was performed on December 11th and she is still recuperating in the hospital. Zheng realized the pain and decided to sue Shi Shuanghu to the police station. After interrogating Shi, the police station transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.

### Why Wasn't the Wooden Shed Demolished When the Fire Spread? The Director Responded One by One

After Fire Department Director Zhou completed his report, Ge Kexin, chairman of the Fire Investigation Committee, inquired as to why the fire spread. He asked whether the firefighters could have demolished the wooden shed on the east side of the Wang family's house when No. 29 had not yet caught fire, in order to isolate the fire. Director Zhou replied that, according to the decades of experience of various officers, the fire spread from the window on the second floor of No. 29 to the ceiling of the second floor, that is, the mezzanine between the second and third floors. When the fire was brewing in the ceiling, it was difficult to detect. Furthermore, after the wooden shed was extinguished, no firefighters entered to observe, and the owners of the Wang family's house had also left. This can be proven by two points: (1) the servant's residence on the second floor was burned, and (2) the outside of the third floor was not burned, but the inside was. The reason why the fire could not be controlled was that these Western-style houses were built five years before the Republic of China. According to the report of the Municipal Council, although the house had a fire wall, the wooden frames of the house were pierced through the fire wall. Moreover, according to the research results of the engineering experts of the first section of the Fire Department, there were many wooden frames in the continuous roof, which had been dry for 40 years, so it was very easy for the fire to spread after it penetrated the roof. The eight Western-style houses on Seymour Road were 200 feet long in total, and the entire spread time was reported to be only two hours.

As for why the wooden shed attached to No. 29 was not demolished, Director Zhou's reply was: A fire scene commander must take care of everything on the scene, which is actually difficult, and at least 20 to 30 people were needed to pull down the wooden shed of the Wang house, so there were not enough people at the time. Later, the wooden shed was once extinguished. Although the district team leader Zhu Qinglan entered No. 29 to observe, he retreated after discovering that there was no one in the house. He did not pay close attention to the point of the fire spreading beforehand.

Chairman Ge then told Director Zhou that, according to the results of the Investigation Committee, there were several firefighters in the house before No. 29 spread the fire. What were these people doing in No. 29? If their mission was to observe whether the fire was spreading and they found nothing, letting it spread, then these people should bear the greatest responsibility. Director Zhou nodded in agreement and said that he would investigate closely.

Director Zhou also explained the strict standard for calculating the fire time, which is from the time the alarm is received to the time the fire is controlled. Other factors, such as the time before the fire department received the alarm and the remaining fire after it was controlled, should not be included. Therefore, the correct calculation of this major fire was only four hours, but if the remaining fire was included, it would be 20 hours.

### Inspector Cheng's Resignation Approved; Expressed Delight, Quoting Bernays

Cheng Zhonghang, Jiangsu Regional Inspector of the Control Yuan, has repeatedly requested to resign from his position as inspector since being hired as the president of the Xinmin News Daily board of directors in May of last year. After seven months, at the end of last year, Cheng again earnestly resigned to the Control Yuan, stating that he was focusing on running the newspaper business and had no time to concurrently handle official duties. Director Yu approved the resignation ten days ago, and sent a personal letter to Cheng expressing his comfort. A reporter interviewed Cheng yesterday to inquire about his feelings on resigning. Cheng said: Bernays said that the only days government officials were truly happy were the days they were appointed and the days they were relieved of their duties. I only reluctantly accepted the appointment as inspector in Jiangsu two years ago, and there was absolutely no happiness to speak of. Over the past year, I have received a lot of care and assistance from all parties, but there are no real achievements to speak of. However, I am truly delighted that my resignation has been approved today, and I can finally fulfill my long-cherished wish. In the future, I will fight for the Five-Power Constitution as an independent citizen, and devote myself to social, cultural, and academic endeavors.

### Excavation of the Fire Site Began Yesterday; Wang Yunfu Was Open-Minded: It's Alright If It's Burned

[Report from our Newspaper] The excavation of the five burnt houses began at 2:00 PM yesterday. Wang Yunfu and his daughter Wang Chuqin (Wen Ying) personally supervised the work. The excavation was led by Zhang Da, director of the Police Bureau's Inspectorate Division, and supervised by Inspector Xu Guang, District Representative Liu Jingru, Bao Chief Cai Guozhan, and Jiangning District Branch Officer Lin, along with three police officers. At the same time, Bao Chief Cai hired seven laborers to excavate the collapsed parts of the Wang family's living room and the young mistress's bedroom first. Since the excavation work only started yesterday, only surface work has been done, so no important evidence has been found as of 6:00 PM yesterday. The items found included two iron railings from the stove, a piece of iron sheet from the roof, a camphor wood hinge, two box clasps, and a padlock. In addition, radio parts, movie projector parts, corrugated iron sheets, and other items were also found. All the excavated items have been listed and handed over to the Wang family for inspection.

Wang arrived at the fire site at 2:00 PM yesterday as scheduled to supervise the work. Although he wanted to retire several times, he was finally retained by Director Zhang and Bao Chief Cai. He left at 5:00 PM. He was once surrounded by reporters, but Wang refused to reveal anything. When asked about the 18-karat diamond ring, he flatly denied it, saying it was just the children talking nonsense. When the reporter asked if the loss was very large this time, Wang said he didn't care at all, claiming: "I will live for a maximum of ten more years. I can't take anything with me when I die. Calligraphy, paintings, antiques, etc., are like children's toys, it's alright if they're burned."

The excavation work at the fire site will continue from 8:00 AM this morning. Mayor Wu has allocated 600,000 yuan in excavation funds yesterday and handed them over to Director Zhang to transfer to Bao Chief Cai for responsible handling. According to Bao Chief Cai, the daily wage for the laborers is 15,000 yuan, and they work eight hours a day, so the cost may be more than 600,000 yuan.

### Zhongshan Steel Company's Steel Illegally Sold, Proceeds Exceeding Ten Million, Divided into Six Shares, Ministry of Economic Affairs Sends Personnel to Investigate, Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation

[Report from our Newspaper] The Zhongshan Steel Company's Pudong factory was occupied by the Japanese army during the occupation. After the victory, the Japanese left a large amount of scrap steel and ore. Recently, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau received a secret report stating that someone was illegally selling the steel at the site. The Handling Bureau submitted a report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent Shen Guowei to investigate on August 1st of last year. It was found that a wooden boat with license number 7634 and a wooden boat with an unknown license number were loading steel. Shen Guowei then visited Huang Fuzhen, a suspect in the secret report. Huang directly admitted to the illegal sale, but invited Shen to the Far East Ballroom that evening to talk about it. Shen went to the appointment that night. According to Huang, the motive for the illegal sale was that certain local individuals (who refused to disclose their names) colluded with workers such as Yu Zhenghai to illegally sell the steel. They had transported 20 tons of pig iron, which was sold for 12 million yuan, which was divided into six shares. The local individuals received five shares, and the workers at the site received one share. Huang Fuzhen also tried to bribe Shen with 800,000 yuan. Shen Guowei reported the information to the Handling Bureau. Because the matter involved theft, the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal investigation yesterday.

### Donating Funds to Purchase Aircraft to Support Enemy Nations' Wars of Aggression: Sun Tianchang's Offense is Irrefutable; Military Tribunal Files Public Prosecution for War Crimes

The case of Korean Sun Youchang, who had a background in mechanical engineering and established the Precision Mechanical Arts Company in Shanghai, involves allegations that in October of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], he was designated by the enemy military as a Class B military-designated factory. Furthermore, he is accused of collecting various coins on behalf of the enemy, manufacturing munitions, erecting anti-aircraft guns on rooftops, and presenting airplanes to the enemy military. After being reported, he underwent several interrogations and was released on bail. According to reports from reporters, Sun Tianchang's crime of collaborating with the enemy has been confirmed, and Military Tribunal Prosecutor Tu Jun has formally filed a public prosecution. The full text of the indictment is recorded below:

Defendant Sun Tianchang, male, 42 years old, of Korean nationality, residing at 929 Beichang Road, Shanghai. The defendant is suspected of being a war criminal (Case No. 162 of the 35th Year's War Investigation), and after investigation by this military prosecutor, it is deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. The facts of the crime, evidence, and relevant legal provisions are listed as follows:

Defendant Has a Technician Background

Defendant Sun Tianchang, with a background in mechanical engineering, established the Precision Mechanical Arts Company in Shanghai, manufacturing industrial machines such as lathes and milling machines, employing 77 male and female workers. After the enemy military occupied Shanghai, in October of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], he was designated by the enemy military as a Class B military-designated factory, ordering him to manufacture small milling machine pumps, etc. After the victory, the Enemy and Puppet Industry Administration Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region confiscated it and allocated it to the state. After the Japanese surrendered, the defendant continued to reside at the original address, but the factory ceased operations.

Suspicious Objects Discovered

On May 28th of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, upon orders to relocate Korean residents from the Hartong Building, discovered eight telescopes and six small cameras in the defendant's showroom, suspected of having military connections. Consequently, the defendant was summoned for interrogation. After investigation, the department determined that the case belonged to ordinary criminal matters and, on July 11th of the same year, transferred it to the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The defendant was released on bail of 10 million yuan. In October of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], citizens Zhou Hanpu, Han Kaiyuan, and Zhou Qingrong reported to the former Military Statistics Bureau that the defendant had donated airplanes to the enemy, contracted to repair all the machinery of the Jinling Arsenal, occupied the main factory of the British-owned Moudeli Piano Company, collected various coins for the enemy's use in manufacturing munitions, and erected anti-aircraft guns on the rooftop. On December 23rd, Liang Mingfang, a staff officer of the bureau, along with the informants, sealed off a considerable amount of materials at the defendant's association treasury at 1350 Seymour Road and his residence at 929 Beichang Road. On May 4th of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], the Enemy and Puppet Industry Administration Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, with Approval No. Hu Zi San Zi 25567 and Notice No. Fa Zi 10906 from the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, ordered that, except for the Japanese orders which should be confiscated, the above-mentioned seized materials and factory property should be returned to the defendant.

Informants Report Again

The informants were dissatisfied with the above disposition and, on August 21st of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], filed a complaint with the Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office, requesting that he be punished as a traitor. Subsequently, the office, under Instruction No. Jing Juan Zi San Zi 11068 from the Ministry of Justice, deemed Koreans who originally belonged to Japan as enemies, and on October 21st of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], transferred the case to this court for investigation according to law.

Difficult to Shed War Crime Responsibility

The investigators, Zhou Rongqing, etc., do not know the defendant, but the matters they reported are vivid. Hu Chenggen, a worker at the Arts and Crafts Company, also provided testimony unfavorable to the defendant at the High Prosecutor's Office, indicating considerable criminal suspicion. Upon interrogation, the defendant admitted to donating 400,000 yuan to the enemy, used by the enemy to purchase machinery. As for Hu Chenggen, he claimed to be a dismissed worker with accumulated grievances. He also argued that the testimony of other witnesses cited by the informants, Zhu Rongfang, Huang Meizhang, Chen Junqiu, Song Genfu, and Ji Xinggen, was not unfavorable to him, so he generally denied the remaining items. However, even based on the defendant's donation of funds to the enemy for the purchase of aircraft, it is clearly an act of supporting the enemy's war of aggression against our country, and it is difficult to evade responsibility for war crimes.

In summary, the defendant should be considered a war criminal and is suspected of violating Article 6, Section 1 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations. In accordance with Article 26 of the same law and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed, requesting immediate trial in accordance with the law.

### Jiang Shangda Sentenced to One Year and Three Months; Lenient Sentence Due to His "Not Inconsiderable Service"; Defendant's Lawyer Represents Him in Court Due to Illness

[This Newspaper] Jiang Shangda, who served as the Deputy Chairman of the Puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Textile Industry Association, a member of the Puppet Cotton Control Committee, and a director of the Puppet Business Association, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday morning. Jiang was unable to attend court due to illness, and his defense lawyer, Zhou Yingcai, attended the hearing on his behalf. Chief Judge Liu stood and read out the judgment: "Jiang Shangda colluded with enemy nations to plot resistance against this country, sentenced to imprisonment for one year and three months, and deprivation of public rights for two years. Property is to be confiscated, except for a portion reserved for the necessary living expenses of the family." He briefly added, "The defendant served as the Deputy Chairman of the Puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Textile Industry Association and a member of the Puppet Cotton Control Committee, maintaining the assets of the textile industry and preserving 2.2 million spindles. He also opposed the enemy's control of yarn and cloth, and was detained by the enemy for 83 days. As for serving in puppet positions, he had registered with the Central Statistics Bureau, which has provided a letter proving this. He also subsidized the military expenses of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, which is not inconsiderable service, so the sentence is lenient."

It is noted that Jiang Shangda is suffering from severe lung disease and has been released on bail by the High Court for treatment. He is currently residing at Cambridge Hospital for treatment, and whether his sentence has expired has not yet been calculated.

### Tailor Poses as False Policeman: Witnesses Interrogated in Ma Yigen Case

[This Newspaper] Ma Yigen, accused of being a suspected traitor, was tried in the High Court yesterday. The defendant studied tailoring in Japan in his youth, and after returning to China, he relied on tailoring in Pudong for a living. During the occupation of Shanghai, because the defendant was proficient in Japanese, he was able to serve as a clerk in the Puppet Pudong Police Station, responsible for liaising with the enemy naval landing force on Dongchang Road. Yesterday, witnesses Yang Meisheng, Xu Xiangshou, etc., were summoned for interrogation.

However, yesterday, investigations by the Social Affairs Bureau revealed that as many as sixty merchants were violating the agreed price. Chief Ke immediately telephoned Mayor Wu for instructions.

Therefore, with the help of the rising gold market, it soon rebounded to 857 yuan. No. 198, No. 89, No. 180, No. 188, and No. 97 put pressure, and No. 99 also sold Yong Yarn for immediate delivery. Deferred delivery once retreated to around the opening line. As gold prices rose without returning, No. 197, No. 151, No. 145, No. 223, No. 154, and No. 224 all entered the market. No. 218 bought for immediate delivery. A large player covered positions urgently off-market. It was said that the yarn dealer Hong was covering positions relentlessly, and deferred delivery was raised to 905 yuan. No. 177 and No. 35 sold off at high prices and retreated to 888 yuan. No. 186, No. 156, No. 154, and No. 145 bought vigorously, and deferred delivery rose to 920 yuan. Immediate delivery also saw a high price of 915 yuan. No. 13 and others sold at high prices, and the market began to consolidate. The afternoon close showed an inverted image of immediate and deferred delivery. As a result, Yong Yarn and Xinyu He rose by a little less than 10% compared to the previous close. Meiya Jingfu, Xinguang, Qin and Huafeng each rose by about 5%. Deferred delivery Yong Yarn rose by a little less than 10%, and Xinyu He, Xinguang, and Huafeng each rose by 5%. In the afternoon, No. 186 immediately entered the market, and immediate delivery opened high to 915 yuan. After No. 84, No. 231, No. 196, No. 49, and No. 111 sold off, it fell to 898 yuan. No. 68, No. 99, No. 89, and No. 198 bought in, and it once rebounded to 913 yuan. No. 197 and No. 235 repeatedly supplied, and the gold market, which was high, returned. It was rumored that the conversion was 6,700, which was much lower than the banknote market, and it gradually fell to 885 yuan. The closing price was heavily contended, and the closing price was slightly disputed. As a result, Yong Yarn and Xinyu He rose by half a percent compared to the previous close. Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by a little less than half a percent. Meiya and Huafeng only reported a slight increase. Cold stock Shangwu once reported a limit-up, and Tongyi and Xinya each rose by 10%, while the rest rose by about 5%. Deferred delivery only had half-day trading. Yong Yarn and Xinyu He each rose by a little less than 10%, and Xinyu He, Xinguang, and Huafeng each rose by 5%. All stocks outside the market.

Foreign stocks yesterday saw enthusiastic buying intentions from major players such as Dakangcheng, and Jardine Matheson rose the most, followed by others. As a result, Jardine Matheson rose by 15% alone compared to the previous close, land reclamation rose slightly, and Jardine Matheson Yarn, Paper, Shipping, and Steel each rose by 10%, while the rest rose by about 5%.

### Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee Passes Rules for Purchasing Foreign Cotton

Import licenses issued to yarn factories in principle

[Report from our newspaper] The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Transportation Control Committee held a meeting at the Quota Allocation Office of the Transportation Control Committee at 3 p.m. yesterday. Director Li Gan, Committee Members Wu Weijing, Rong Yixin, and attendees Wang Qiyu, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Zhang Silu, and Liu Wenteng, head of the Business Office of the Textile Control Committee, were present. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m.

At yesterday's meeting, Director Li Gan announced all the articles of the rules for purchasing foreign cotton that had been passed by the Executive Committee of the Transportation Control Committee a few days ago, and explained them in detail. All attendees did not express any objections. These rules will be implemented starting yesterday. Also at yesterday's meeting, the second allocation was made to yarn factories that had applied for emergency cotton purchases, including Hengtong, Minfeng, Liliyong, Shenxin 7, Qinfeng, and Hefeng. The allocated amount has not yet been finalized. The full text of the rules for purchasing foreign cotton is explored below.

Rules for Purchasing Foreign Cotton

A. Regarding the Yarn Factory Section:

(1) Hereafter, cotton import licenses shall be issued to yarn factories in principle. Each yarn factory applying for an import license shall submit it to the Import Quota Allocation Office.

(2) The Import Quota Allocation Office shall issue import licenses based on the allocation certificates issued by the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee. The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee shall be composed of the director of the Import Quota Allocation Office and one representative from both state-owned and private yarn factories.

The total foreign cotton quota shall be allocated according to the following standards. The gross amount of foreign cotton that each factory participating in the allocation should obtain shall be divided equally based on the ratio of the number of spindles each factory has in operation to the total number of spindles in operation of all yarn factories. Within the gross amount each yarn factory should obtain, the factory's original inventory and the orders placed before November 17, 1946, that have not yet been imported but have already obtained import licenses, should be deducted. From this, the net amount of foreign cotton the factory should obtain is calculated. Based on this figure, an allocation certificate is issued. The aforementioned allocation amount shall be calculated based on the need for three months of orders beyond the four months of inventory that each factory should have. The inventory and order needs of each factory shall include at least 30% of domestic cotton usage.

(3) Yarn factories intending to purchase foreign cotton shall register with the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee and state the following in the application:

(A) The number of spindles currently in operation;

(B) The current cotton inventory and the expected possible receipt of orders. The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee has the right to verify the application by means of auditing and verifying the property inventory. If there is any false declaration, penalties may be imposed.

(4) After receiving the allocation certificate, the yarn factory may purchase cotton from one or more cotton importers who have registered with the Provisional Import Management Committee, within the quantity approved by the allocation certificate. The list of registered cotton importers shall be announced to each yarn factory by the committee. Each yarn factory shall attach the allocation certificate when applying for an import license.

(5) When applying for an import license, each yarn factory shall list in detail the payment and shipment methods. In accordance with past cotton business practices, the period for purchasing cotton and settling foreign exchange shall be handled after the arrival of the goods or later, based on the endorsement of the customs on the back of the license. For cotton paid for by letter of credit, foreign exchange can only be settled after the goods are shipped or later.

(6) Cotton ordered by yarn factories before November 17, 1946, that has not been approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank shall be regarded as applications after November 17. Within the scope of the amount approved by the allocation certificate, a reapplication may be made. For this cotton, the yarn factory should be allowed to settle foreign exchange. However, when settling foreign exchange, the price opened in New York (or Mumbai) for the goods of that month on the date of application for the import license shall be the standard for the application. Each yarn factory must list the basic price in the application and fully explain the calculation method of the cost of the item at the port.

(7) The Import Quota Allocation Office has the right to order each yarn factory to purchase cotton from various cotton-producing countries in different currencies according to the ratio stipulated by the Central Bank.

(8) Yarn factories shall not transfer their existing cotton to others without the prior written approval of the Import Quota Allocation Office.

(9) For the convenience of yarn factories, when issuing allocation certificates, the allocation unit may be 50 bales or more at the request of the yarn factory.

B. Regarding the Importer Section:

(1) From now on, import license applications must be submitted by yarn factories to the Import Quota Allocation Office. The issuance of permits is generally aimed at yarn factories.

(2) Permits may be issued for goods ordered before November 17, 1946, that have not been imported, but only if they have been approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank. Otherwise, they will be listed as applications after November 17. The issuance of import licenses shall be handled in accordance with the following regulations:

(A) 1. When paying for the purchase of cotton and settling foreign exchange, the price opened in New York (or Mumbai) for the goods of that month on the date of submission of the import license application shall be the standard for the application.

2. In order to comply with the provision that the issuance of permits should be aimed at yarn factories, if the transported cotton has been sold to someone other than the yarn factory, the cotton shall be resold to the yarn factory.

3. Cotton that has already been shipped on November 24, 1946, but has not been sold may be sold to a yarn factory that has obtained an allocation certificate.

4. Under no circumstances will import licenses be issued for cotton that has not been shipped or sold before November 4.

(B) The cotton purchase limit for this season will be allocated to each yarn factory in the near future. The existing cotton inventory of each factory and the goods ordered before November 17 that have been approved for import shall be accurately calculated in order to determine the allocation amount for each yarn factory. Cotton related to Article 2(A) above shall be regarded as applications after November 17 and may be sold separately to each factory within the scope of the allocation amount that each factory should obtain. Importers should give priority to selling or reselling the above-mentioned cotton to yarn factories with a shortage of cotton, and the yarn factories shall apply for a permit from the Import Quota Allocation Office in accordance with the regulations. For applications after November 17, importers and yarn factories should negotiate the method themselves. The Import Quota Allocation Office shall not be responsible for any disputes arising from the transaction.

(3) Subsequently, yarn factories purchasing cotton from importers shall be limited to importers who have registered with the Provisional Import Management Committee.

(4) Applications that have been submitted to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank and should not be treated as orders before November 17 shall be returned to the original applicant.

### Cheng Qibao Returns from Investigation and Discusses the Education Situation in the Northeast; Reception for Capital Reporters at the Ministry of Education Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Education previously sent a Northeast Education Investigation Team, composed of Cheng Qibao (Member of the Education Research Committee of the Ministry of Education), Zhou Huowen (Deputy Director of the Training Committee), Sun Aitang, and Cai Ruoshui (both inspectors of the Ministry), a group of four, who departed on November 20 of last year for a two-and-a-half-month investigation. They recently returned to Beijing and reported to the Ministry of Education. Our reporter interviewed Committee Member Cheng Qibao to discuss the education situation in the Northeast. I am pleased to report the outline below:

General Situation

The Northeast has nine provinces and two cities. This investigation only focused on the recovered western provinces and key transportation points, such as Shenyang, Siping Street, Changchun, Yongji, Andong, Jinzhou, and Fushun. In terms of the education situation, the recovery is going smoothly. However, the school organization, curriculum, and teaching materials during the enemy and puppet regime were different, and it is difficult to connect and adjust to the current system. The students' level is relatively poor because Chinese was not emphasized before, there was no English, civics, history, geography, or ideology. The above-mentioned points are currently being adjusted, improved, and resolved. Fortunately, the faculty and staff, although in the occupied area for many years, have been able to maintain their inherent spirit and have not been changed by the evil forces' unwavering will. The general middle school youth students are emotional and have a strong enthusiasm for caring about the motherland, which is very strong and is expressed at any time. Their desire for knowledge is particularly deep. Their physical fitness is strong, and their ability to govern themselves is strong, which are all good signs. However, after being oppressed by the enemy and puppet regime for many years, all actions and thoughts have been controlled and unfree for a long time. Now that they have been recovered and liberated, they do not know what to do. Those of us who are responsible for education should reveal the path and provide good guidance. In terms of the general school situation, whether it is a university, middle school, or elementary school, there is a lack of teaching staff and talent, and a large number of supplements are needed. It is hoped that ambitious young people in the mainland can go to the Northeast to assist in the education process. Then, the Northeast will not be difficult to gradually restore its original state with its original good quality. In addition, school equipment was damaged too much during the war. Books and instruments are extremely scarce. Students often sit on the floor in class. It is hoped that the central government will allocate a large amount of funds to relieve the situation and enrich the equipment.

Overview of Higher Education

The original Northeastern University has been restored. Shenyang Medical College has full equipment and a grand scale, ranking first in the country. However, the faculty has not been adjusted. There are still more than 40 Japanese teachers. In addition, Changchun University is located in Changchun, and Changbai Normal College is located in Yongji. The Ministry of Education plans to establish Binjiang University once Harbin is recovered. According to the education situation in the Northeast, many colleges and vocational schools still need to be established, especially vocational schools, which should be established more to cultivate technical talents to supply the needs of local new construction. Because there is a lack of technical talents now, there are still thousands of Japanese technicians left in their posts and unable to be supplemented. Taking the Fushun Coal Mine as an example, there are more than 2,000 Japanese personnel left in their posts. The Resources Committee is also planning to train technical talents for supplementation.

Primary and Secondary Education

Compared with before September 18, the number of middle schools and students has increased, with some increasing by more than one time. However, the level has declined and methods should be sought to improve it. National schools, because some places are unstable, recovery is more difficult, but the general situation is still good, and most can continue to resume schooling. According to the investigation, the number of children out of school accounts for about 60%, so national education should be actively promoted.

Current Status of Social Education

Due to the beginning of the recovery, it has not been fully developed. The original Panyanggang Library has been restored and recently merged with the museum to become the National Shenyang Museum, divided into library and museum departments. The Northeast currently lacks cultural food the most. It is hoped that the central government will transport and supply various publications in large quantities, and electro-optical education equipment is especially needed.

Establishment of Temporary University

When the Northeast was recovered, a temporary university was established with 2,000 students from the enemy and puppet regime's national high school students and specialized students, as well as students returning from Japan. After a year of training, they have been assigned to various universities in the Northeast to continue their studies.

Appeasing Refugees

In order to relieve out-of-school youths who have escaped from the bandit area, a joint middle school was established in Changchun. It has been operating for more than half a year, and there are already 3,000 students. Now, there are rumors that students from Heilongjiang, Harbin, and other places are escaping and going to study.

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Northeast Education Investigation Team, including Cheng Qibao, received reporters at the Ministry of Education this afternoon and reported on the education situation in the Northeast.

### Japan to Implement New 6-3 School System

Three Years of Junior High School Also Compulsory Education

[Gaizosha, Tokyo, 5th] Today, Hidaka, Director of the School Education Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Education, stated that he will overcome all difficulties and implement the new 6-3 school system starting from the new semester in April of this year, that is, every citizen will receive six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, totaling nine years of compulsory education. In the past, compulsory education was limited to six years of elementary school.

### Ministry of Education Rewards Wartime Bereaved Youth for Further Studies

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Education rewards youth who suffered during the Anti-Japanese War and has specially formulated measures to encourage further studies. The main points are as follows: (1) Young people who were in the occupied areas during the war and suffered due to performing special tasks for our side, and who have been studying at or above the college level and have certificates, can participate in middle school teacher training. After being admitted, they will be trained for half a year and assigned to serve in secondary schools, with a quota of 200 people tentatively. (2) Those who have been studying in secondary schools and have certificates can participate in elementary school teacher training. After being admitted, they will be trained for half a year and assigned to serve in elementary schools, with a quota of 500 people tentatively. (3) Those who have been studying at or above the college level or have graduated and have certificates can participate in education administration training. After being admitted, they will be trained for half a year and assigned to work in education bureaus in various provinces and cities, or assigned as county education bureau chiefs, with a quota of 400 people tentatively. (4) Those who have graduated or studied at secondary schools or above and have certificates, and who are willing to pursue further studies, will be assigned to study in appropriate schools at all levels according to their level after being admitted. In addition to public expenses, they will also be given books and uniforms. For the above four items, the bereaved youth can choose one to participate in further studies according to their academic ability. The Ministry of Education is forming a committee to be responsible for handling this matter.

### Twelve Private Elementary Schools in This City Opened Without Permission

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to regulations, the establishment of private schools requires the board of directors to apply for registration and report the opening to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval before enrolling students and starting classes. Recently, a small number of private schools have failed to follow the legal procedures and have advertised for enrollment without authorization. It is reported that the Municipal Bureau of Education has decided to crack down on this, and those who fraudulently use registered names will also be investigated and banned. The previous report detailed the private middle schools that should be banned. It is now known that the National Education Section of the Bureau of Education has separately notified private elementary schools that have not reported for registration for discussions.

### Principals and Teachers of People's Schools Renamed as "Directors"

Notice Issued by the Municipal Bureau of Education

It is reported that the Bureau of Education has issued separate notices to this effect.

### Football Friendly Game Was One-Sided: Railway Team Won Against Hequn Yesterday 4-0, Two Goals in Each Half

[Our Newspaper's Report] The football friendly game between the Railway team and the Hequn team was held yesterday afternoon at Jinyuan Park. Because no tickets were sold, there were more than 4,000 spectators. The game turned out to be one-sided, with the Railway team winning by four goals and the Hequn team scoring zero. The Railway team led 2-0 in the first half.

The Hequn team has not performed well in this year's football league. Recently, the team has been revitalized and joined the Mayor's Cup competition, hoping to show their potential. Therefore, yesterday's friendly game with the Railway team had a significant test meaning. The result was still disorganized, and they suffered a shutout, which is a cause for concern for their future.

The Railway Team's All-Out Offensive Was Fierce

After the whistle sounded, the army pressed forward, but their footwork was slightly poor. Zhang Jie dribbled three times, and Xiao Ziwen attacked twice, but both failed. Hequn's goalkeeper Yao Chong's business was booming, and center-back Qian Changrong was also extremely busy for a while. At 25 minutes, Zhang Jie of the Railway team led an attack with three troops. Sun and Huang, the two defenders of Hequn, blocked side by side. Zhang Jie passed the ball forward, Yao Chong jumped out to catch the ball but failed, and Lin Dianyi rushed over and kicked it in, and the city of Hequn fell. The whole army was shocked and counterattacked very quickly, but they lacked connection, and the Railway's defense was strict, so they were unsuccessful. At 40 minutes, Zhang Jie of the Railway team, single-handedly rushed into the Hequn's territory and scored another goal. In the first half, the Railway team took the lead with 2-0.

Hequn's Morale Became Even More Scattered

The morale became even more scattered as they switched sides, and they had no power to counterattack. At 20 minutes, Fei Chunlin of the Railway team scored a goal from 20 yards away, making it 3-0. The situation on the Hequn's side became even more miserable, but the generals of the Railway team were ruthless and continued to press on. At 30 minutes, Xiao Ziwen attacked from the side, Yao Chong was a little slow and didn't catch it, and Lin Dianyi suddenly emerged with a cold shot and scored another goal, 4-0. Hequn was at a loss. Later, the Railway's offensive did not slacken, and at times the crowd was crowded on the Hequn's side, forming a funnel shape, which benefited Hequn, because it was impossible for the Railway team to attack from the side. When time was up, Hequn was defeated by the Railway team 4-0.

### Basketball League: Chunmao vs. Giant Tonight

In the second Basketball League, there were originally three games scheduled for today: the women's group Xuebai vs. the women's Qingzi, the second division Jia You vs. the Railway Shanghai, and the first division Chunmao vs. Giant. However, because most of the players from the Railway Shanghai of the second division Jia You went to Hong Kong with the inter-city team and have not returned, the Basketball Committee decided to allow a postponement. Therefore, today's schedule has been slightly changed. The game will now start at 6:30 PM. The first game is the women's group Xuebai facing the women's Qingzi. The women's Qingzi have been in good condition recently, and they will definitely put up a fierce resistance when they play against Xuebai.

In the first division, Chunmao will play against Giant. The former defeated Hualian in the first game and their momentum is high. The Giant team, with foreigners such as Tao Bolin, the Sa Sijin brothers, Qiang Dulai, and Ye Long, is also not weak. They have pure and skilled connections and an organized lineup. When the two heroes meet, there will definitely be a dramatic performance. The revised schedule for today is: Xuebai - Women's Qingzi (Women's) 6:30 PM Chunmao - Giant (First Division) 7:30 PM

### Observations on Returning Home

— Mei Jingzhou, Envoy to Cuba

On July 25th, Year 35 of the Republic of China, I received orders to return home to report on my duties. After completing the procedures for purchasing ship tickets, I departed from Pearl Harbor at 2 p.m. on August 9th. I estimate that I will be staying in the motherland for five months. I will now describe my observations on the journey back home and my activities in the country:

Ten Chinese on the Oriental Ship Seemed to be Embracing Their Mother

The ship we were on was the "Oriental" ocean liner. There were ten Chinese passengers traveling with me. I had been away from the motherland for seventeen years. When I boarded the ship, it felt like embracing my mother, and I was very happy. Especially on August 23rd, when the ship arrived at the mouth of the Wusong River, looking out over the entire territory of Shanghai, witnessing the scene of "Recovered Rivers and Mountains, Homeland Renewed," a kind of indescribable joy filled my heart!

On the evening of the 24th, our ship dropped anchor at the entrance of the Huangpu River. It was in the middle of the Yangtze River, and at night everything was silent, and the stars were shining brightly. More than a dozen steamships were moored nearby, and the lights leaking from the ships swayed with the waves, making people feel fascinated. A bright moon hung in the sky, evoking the sentiment of the Tang poem: "This life, this night is rarely good, where shall we see the bright moon next year?"

Losing a Day Imperceptibly Passing Through the "International Date Line" by Boat

On the 25th, which was a Sunday, our ship sailed into the Huangpu River. We saw the docks and warehouses on both sides. Stretching for several miles, huge warships were moored on both sides. Shanghai is truly worthy of being an important commercial port in our country. After arriving at the port, we stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. The Cathay Hotel has nine floors, overlooking the entire city of Shanghai, everything is clearly visible. That evening, I was invited by President Sun Zhesheng to have dinner at his residence, and it was already midnight when I returned to my residence.

Our ship sailed at a speed of 13.54 nautical miles per hour, traveling approximately 325 nautical miles per day. From departure to Shanghai, the journey took a total of fifteen days. Statistically, during these fifteen days, from August 9th to 13th, the wind was calm and the waves were gentle. Looking out on the deck, I felt the vastness of the sea and sky, without any shore. In such a large universe, an individual is even smaller than "a drop in the ocean"!

On the 14th, because the ship passed through the International Date Line, we imperceptibly lost a day. After the 13th, it was the 15th. Originally, the Earth rotates from west to east, turning fifteen degrees every hour, which is called self-rotation. The entire Earth completes its rotation in exactly 24 hours. At the same time, the direction our ship was traveling was opposite to its direction of rotation, it was heading west, gaining more opportunities to face the sun. Therefore, after passing through this "International Date Line" assumed by geographers, one day should be subtracted to match the dates of various countries in the world. If you are traveling from China to the United States, after passing through this line, you have to add a day.

On that day, the wind and waves suddenly became stronger, and I suffered a lot from "seasickness." It was not until the 19th that the wind and waves calmed down again. After that, until Shanghai, there were no major storms. The above is a rough description of the journey back home.

Ninety Days on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line to See the Abundant Regions of Jiangnan

From the time I returned to China on August 25th to the end of September, more than a month was spent on banquets and social engagements, which kept me very busy. All those I met were government officials and leaders from all walks of life, so I learned a lot about the situation in the country. During this period, I went to Nanjing once and to Suzhou once. I went to Nanjing for official business, and I went to Suzhou for sightseeing. As the saying goes, "There is paradise above, and Suzhou and Hangzhou below." The beauty of the landscape in Suzhou is indescribable: the clear and unique springs and rocks of Tiger Hill, the secluded and beautiful streams and valleys of Lingyan, and Dengwei, famous for its plum blossoms, all make people linger and forget to return. Other places such as Xiyuan and Liuyuan are very elegantly arranged, while Hanshan Temple and Canglang Pavilion are antique and make people reluctant to leave. Lingyan Temple is about twenty miles outside the city of Suzhou. We went there and climbed to the top of the mountain. Looking down, the scenery of the entire Taihu Lake is indeed a natural and beautiful picture. We know that the output of lake silk accounts for half of the Taihu Lake area, so looking down from the top of the mountain, the mulberry forests and fields are connected, Jiangnan is indeed an abundant region!

There is also one thing worth mentioning: on September 10th, it was already midnight, and Mr. Wang Xianting from the Shenbao newspaper accompanied me to visit the Shenbao. At that time, their editorial department and typesetting room were working hard. The electric lights were bright, and everyone was working spiritedly, almost making people suspect it was daytime rather than late at night. The Shenbao has the longest history, having been founded during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty. It has the widest circulation, currently reaching more than 150,000 copies.

During the month of October, from the 1st to the 22nd, I went to Nanjing twice, so besides banquets and farewells, I was also constantly traveling on the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line.

Sailing Two Hours Along the Hong Kong Coast into the Pacific Ocean Heading North

During this time in the country, I went to Hong Kong once, on October 23rd. Traveling with me were Consul Li Siling Jiaxiang, Mr. Wang Zhechun, and Western friend Mr. Swiss. We went by plane of the China National Aviation Corporation. At that time, the plane was flying at an altitude of 7,000 feet, and it was quite chilly. That day, we arrived at the Kowloon Airport at 10:30 a.m. and stayed at the Kyoto Hotel. The next day, we took the Anhui ship to Shantou. From Hong Kong to Shantou is 174 nautical miles, which takes 16 hours to sail. After the ship set sail, the harbor was melting and the scenery was pleasant. It can be said that it had both mountain scenery and water scenery. After about two hours, we finished the Hong Kong coast and entered the Pacific Ocean heading north, circling the coast of Guangdong Province. The mountains there were layered upon layered, which looked very beautiful from a distance. The gentle sea breeze blew on our faces, it was truly a pleasure during the journey.

Hong Kong is outside Guangzhou Bay, originally a barren island. After the Opium War, it was ceded to Britain. The British then opened it as a free port, setting up a city on the mountainside, arranged in three rings, upper, middle, and lower, named Victoria City, and sent a governor to manage it. All goods entering and leaving do not need to be taxed, so merchants come here to do trade, and the market becomes prosperous. Now, the telegraph lines and shipping routes are accessible in all directions, making it an important trading center in East Asia.

Since Hong Kong was ceded to Britain, in the tenth year of Xianfeng, a supplementary treaty to the Treaty of Beijing was signed, ceding Kowloon on the opposite side, and they built fortresses to form a strategic position with Hong Kong. In the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu, the Kowloon Concession was also opened, and the islands of Lantau and South Island were also seized one after another, so Hong Kong had full wings.

Staying a Few Days in "Yu Garden" with Pavilions and Buildings on the Mountainside

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the population gradually increased to about 1.5 million people. When I was there, it was during a labor strike. All the Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong stopped publishing on November 6th. The typesetters of the newspapers put forward requests to improve their treatment: (1) to provide three meals a day, (2) to pay for accommodation, (3) to rest one day a week. The newspaper authorities thought it could not be done, so they stopped publishing on their own. At the same time, the Hong Kong authorities were launching a crackdown on unlicensed small stalls. If implemented, 80,000 people would lose their jobs!

Hong Kong's "Yu Garden" is the property of the late Nanyang overseas Chinese tycoon Yu Dongxuan, located on the mountainside. The pavilions and buildings are extremely magnificent. I stayed here for a few days. I was deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of Madam Yu. As for Aberdeen, which is also known as Pak Tin, it is behind Hong Kong. We went there around the mountain from Pok Fu Lam Road in the Western District. Fishermen gather there, making it the largest fishing port in Hong Kong. Its terrain: to the northwest is Mount Kellett, to the south you can see Ap Lei Chau Island, to the east are the brick kiln and Violet Hill, to the west is Po Toi Island, the peaks are stacked, the smoke and waves are vast. We followed the mountain to Repulse Bay, which is on the back of Hong Kong, a place where the mountains surround the sea, not subject to the impact of tides, surrounded by mountains on three sides, facing the sea, the environment is extremely beautiful. The Japanese army landed here when they attacked Hong Kong.

Smugglers Casually Cast Off Regardless of Police Gunshots

According to the Shenbao on December 23rd, it was said that Hong Kong's trade was declining, with November decreasing compared to October.

The "Anhui" ship we took to Shantou arrived at Shantou Bay at 7:30 a.m. on October 25th. Small hills lined both sides of the bay. Entering the bay, as the ship slowly moved forward, there were two smuggling boats sailing along with our ship. The smugglers on those two boats threw goods down into the boat with ropes. The police officers on our ship fired guns to scare them. They acted as if nothing had happened, leisurely casting off and leaving. This kind of blatant smuggling was quite interesting!

After arriving in Shantou, we rested at the "Moon Garden Apartment." Shantou was opened as a commercial port in the ninth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty. It is the general gathering place for goods from more than forty counties in southern Fujian, eastern Guangdong, and the southeastern corner of Jiangxi. It is the throat of the Han River, with steep cliffs and vast seas. The water flow is very deep, so the entry and exit of cargo ships is extremely convenient. The trade of the Han River is all gathered here. At the same time, Chinese laborers and merchants going to Nanyang all pass through this place, so trade with various ports in Nanyang is also extremely prosperous. Before the war, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and other countries had consulates here. Municipal administration was established in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, and all construction has been very progressive. Shantou is the second most important commercial port in South China after Guangzhou. It currently has a population of more than 188,000 people, the total number of foreigners in the city is 34, the total number of households is 27,497, the number of men is 103,586, and the number of women is 85,355.

Leaving Shantou for Chaozhou Along the Highway to Visit the Han Temple with Thousand-Year-Old Sweet Pear Tree

After playing in Shantou for a few days, at 9:10 a.m. on the 28th, Mr. Wang Chunzhe and Mr. Shen Hongyi and I drove along the Chao-Shan Highway to Chaoan, which is Chaozhou Prefecture, which took about an hour and a half. Along the way, the fresh green grass was smiling to greet us. Chaoan is located at the lower reaches of the Chao River, and it is an important place for travel between Fujian and Guangdong. The urban area is crisscrossed and densely populated. In addition to visiting the silk reeling factory, we also visited the Han Xian Temple and the Han Ting Bridge. There is "Yixi Town" in the northeast of the city, also known as "E Xi," which is where Han Wengong (Tuizhi) wrote an essay to drive away crocodiles when he was the prefect of Chaozhou. The people of Chaozhou were very grateful and built a temple to enshrine him. There is a monument in the temple with the four big characters "Thousand-Year Sweet Pear Tree". It is said that the Han Ting Bridge was built after Han Xiangzi became an immortal. We watched Chaozhou opera in Chaozhou, performed by children. Although it was childish, it had a special charm!

According to the statistics of the Chaozhou Customs: In the fifth year of the Republic of China, each month foreign ships entering from Hong Kong, the Nanyang Islands, and other places numbered 104. The import of goods was 1.16 million tons. In the three months of July, August, and September of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the average monthly import of foreign ships was about 42, and the import of goods was 26,000 tons. In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, each month domestic ships from ports such as Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Taiwan entering numbered 71, and the import of goods was 110,000 tons. In the three months of July, August, and September of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the average monthly import of domestic ships from ports such as Guangzhou, Yang, Shanghai, and Taiwan numbered 77, and the import of goods was 1,600 tons.

After returning to China, I felt that the moral degradation of the domestic compatriots, the disappearance of self-esteem, as well as the decline of production, and the chaos of society, all made people feel depressed. In Shantou, I often visited Zhongshan Park, which relieved a lot of the depression in my heart.

Returning to Hong Kong Hearing the Sad News of Donner and Talking About Film Affairs in Friendship

We took the "Chaoan" ship back to Hong Kong on November 4th. On the 10th, the Hong Kong Chinese newspaper published the sad news of the death of Mr. Donner, former advisor to Chairman Chiang, saying that he died of illness at 1:01 a.m. on the 9th at the Hong En Hospital in Shanghai. I had a very deep relationship with Donner, and I was very sad to receive this news. Since returning to China, I had visited him in the hospital twice, and I was very worried because I felt that his physical strength was declining day by day. Donner was 71 years old when he passed away. He was an Australian and had lived in China for 43 years. During the Xi'an Incident, he made great efforts to rescue Chairman Chiang. During this war, he was arrested in the Philippines. Fortunately, he was not recognized and was imprisoned in a concentration camp, where he suffered abuse, which caused him to suffer from severe pulmonary spasms. When I visited the San Francisco World Security Conference, he moved from Lamo Island to Honolulu to seek medical treatment. After a few months, his illness worsened. He came to Shanghai from Honolulu on March 19th, accompanied by Mr. Dong Xian Guang. Unexpectedly, he died of illness in China, how heartbreaking—

Macau's Commerce is Not Prosperous and There is Poor Governance and Many Pirates

On November 11th, I took a boat from Hong Kong to Macau. Macau is at the southern end of the Pearl River Delta, like a small peninsula. It and Hong Kong are both the gateways to the Pearl River, and the situation is excellent. In the thirteenth year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty, the Portuguese came here to colonize, paying an annual rent of 500 taels; in the thirteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the treaty of perpetual cession was completed, and it was thus reduced to foreign territory. The city streets are located at the foot of the mountain. Because it is very close to Hong Kong, commerce is not prosperous. There is poor governance, many pirates, gambling is open, and there is even a gambling tax!

Green Pines and Verdant Enjoy the Village - Visiting the Former Residence on the Birthday of the Father of the Nation

On the 12th, it was the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation. At 8:30 a.m., Mr. Zhang Pengyi, Zhang Canrong, Deputy Consul Li, and I drove from Macau and arrived at Cuiheng in Zhongshan County at 9:30 a.m. After tidying up our clothes, we went to admire the former residence of the Father of the Nation. The scenery there is excellent, the mountain scenery is verdant for ten miles, the land is spiritually rich and the people are outstanding, so that a great man like the Father of the Nation could be born, setting an example for thousands of generations and being the savior of mankind. That day, thousands upon thousands of students and people went to admire the hometown of the Premier, and held a solemn memorial ceremony in front of the former residence. After leaving Cuiheng, we followed the highway through Yaikou, Nanlang, Lanbian, Dahuan, and arrived at Shiqi. County Magistrate Zhang Huichang heard that Mr. Yu and others had arrived, and immediately prepared fine wine and delicacies to express his welcome. The kindness was overwhelming, and it was deeply appreciated.

### Regarding Textbooks

— A Word of Warning

It's the start of the school season again. Parents are busy raising their children's tuition fees, and students are busy purchasing textbooks. The issue of tuition fees has recently been hotly debated by all parties. Those running schools want it to be higher, and parents want it to be lower, each with their own stance and their own suffering. This is not within the scope of our discussion, so we have to set it aside for now. The purchase of textbooks is also not a small problem, and we would like to raise a few points to discuss with everyone.

What we intend to discuss now is not the content and compilation of the textbooks (of course, we also hope that readers will submit articles to this publication to express your opinions), we will only talk about the two aspects of textbook distribution and price. The nationally approved textbooks are still jointly distributed by the nine major bookstores, and the Ministry of Education cannot change this for the time being due to contractual relations. However, we hope that these nine bookstores responsible for distribution will at least have sufficient preparation in terms of quantity, and definitely do not make students have Chinese but no arithmetic, or have arithmetic but lack history and geography. Secondly, expand the places where textbooks are sold as much as possible so that students can buy them everywhere, and don't let the children run to the Fourth Road and squeeze in the bookstore for a long time, often still unable to buy them. Here, we hope that the bookstores will contact the school authorities in advance, and it is best for the schools to collect the book fees and distribute them on behalf of the students, which can save students a lot of trouble.

As for the pricing issue, recently all bookstores have increased their prices. Of course, bookstores have their own difficulties, labor costs are rising with the cost of living index, and paper prices are rising with the black market exchange rate. We sympathize with this. But parents can't bear it. This is a cultural undertaking, this is about the growth of the next generation, we believe that the government should be responsible, it is not enough to just exempt textbooks from business tax. We advocate that the government should provide loans to the bookstores that print these textbooks, and urge them to sell them at the lowest price. When necessary, the government should approve their foreign exchange settlement for the purchase of foreign paper smoothly and quickly.

Finally, regarding the issue of pirated books, we would also like to bring this to everyone's attention. According to the Sino-US trade agreement, all "pirate" versions of foreign books should be discontinued, which is appropriate. But now there is a practical difficulty, that is, the original books cannot reach China quickly, should students who generally need original textbooks "sit and wait for the books"? As far as we know, it sometimes takes six months for foreign books to be ordered and not yet sent. We feel that booksellers have very few solutions to this, and we wonder if the education sector can think of a solution. At the same time, we hope that the government will approve the settlement of foreign exchange for the import of Western books, so as to reduce the burden on students and the academic community, and to encourage the atmosphere of academic research in our country.

### A New Era in the History of Journalism

— Monon

(Written by Hu Daojing, Published by World Book Company)

Hu Daojing, the author of "A New Era in the History of Journalism," can be said to be a deliberate person who has risen after the newspaper industry predecessor Ge Gongzhen. Recently, he has collected his manuscripts on the history of journalism and historical materials written before and after the Anti-Japanese War and compiled them into a volume. Although the materials used are inevitably mixed, they are broad and detailed, and worthy of attention. In terms of the value of the literature, it is as the author said in the preface to "A Sixty-Six Year History of Shenbao" in 1939: "Since the Anti-Japanese War, I have lamented that literature is easy to scatter and difficult to gather. Not wanting to delay, I sorted out the tangled threads, expressed everything I saw, and described the sixty-six year history of Shenbao. At a time of political turbulence and cultural decadence, it is like holding one part of a horse, and the horse is always present in sight." With just this article, the author believes that the author's collection and effort are beyond what ordinary journalists can achieve. He first paid attention to the entrepreneurial process of a major newspaper, the changes in personnel, the changes in the newspaper surface, the improvement of content (including news, commentary, and other reading materials), the innovation of equipment, the transformation of editorial policies, and even the impact of the environment on the newspaper and the impact of the newspaper on the environment. A detailed description has been made.

The greatest advantage of this book lies in the richness of its historical materials on journalism. In addition to devoting all of his physical and mental strength to the life of a journalist, he is able to sort out such fruitful things from a large pile of messy historical materials and newspaper clippings without being tired of trivial details. Even a little bit of small information is included, which cannot be ignored. Everything described is not only detailed, but also vivid and popular. For example, when he talks about newspapers and advertisements, he uses Hu Wenhu as an example, which makes people feel more interested. It is said that Hu Wenhu was originally unwilling to publish advertisements, and believed that the medicines he created had their own "word-of-mouth," and that advertisements "were of no use." A newspaper in Singapore repeatedly solicited advertisements from Yong An Tang but failed. At that time, they came up with a method to make Hu Wenhu know "the power and use of advertisements." So, large characters were published on the cover of the newspaper saying: "What will Hu Wenhu do?" Below was noted: "Please see here tomorrow." Hu Wenhu himself saw it and was immediately very surprised. The next day, the newspaper published large characters again saying: "Hu Wenhu is about to publish an advertisement!" From then on, Hu Wenhu wanted to publish advertisements. This kind of popular and thought-provoking anecdote in the news industry fills this work, especially the origin of newspapers, border newspapers, overseas Chinese newspapers, foreign newspapers in China, and newspaper exhibition special issues. This is another advantage and feature of Tai Xiang.

The author pointed out many "new eras" that have been neglected by historians of the newspaper industry, and determined that the newspaper industry after World War I had already broken away from the three stages of oral news, handwritten news, and printed news, and jumped into a higher and newer stage, namely the radio news era, and World War II threw the radio news era behind it and looked forward to the best and highest stage, namely the era of "television news." This may be due to the haste of compilation and the lack of thorough collection of materials. Although some outlines have been said, it always feels that it cannot meet the needs of readers. In order to make "A New Era in the History of Journalism" more complete and perfect, and more in line with the standard of being worthy of the name, the author would like to add a small hope: I hope that the author can sort out more materials on the "new era" so that the book can add a part of the weight of the times when it is reprinted!

### "Human Biology"

— Tian Mu

—— Modern Biology Series, Volume 1 ——

Written by Zhu Xi, Published by Shanghai Cultural Life Press

This is a series of six volumes examining the mysteries of human reproduction, the enigma of life, the origins of the human race, and experimental educational psychology. If we are looking for an introductory book on biology and social sciences, I dare say this is a relatively good set of books. Here, I will record my impressions after reading this book, as well as the points I consider more important, and introduce this broad, profound, yet easily understood scientific work to the readers.

1. "Egg-Born People and People Who Lay Eggs": The author uses a humorous and witty style to describe the indispensable male and female reproductive organs for reproduction, treating them as equal to all other organs that maintain the body, and openly discusses them. ... We Chinese people consider things related to reproductive organs as vulgar and dirty, unfit for polite society, and tend to keep them secret and unspoken. This is not a wise view, it is a mistaken prejudice! (See Preface). It is precisely because of the lack of sound sex education that an unimaginable disgrace is created. Youth is the most precious and important stage of life, with vigorous physical development, and sexual reproduction and psychological impulses towards the opposite sex, so there is an urgent need for a full understanding of this aspect of knowledge.

How are offspring formed in the mother's body; and how can they reproduce their own offspring? Modern scientists cannot imitate the tyrannical acts of King Zhou of Shang, "disemboweling pregnant women" after intercourse to search for human eggs and observe their changes, nor do they have other humane methods; then, what methods are used to solve this mystery of reproduction? This book reveals them all, and reading it is refreshing.

2. "Our Ancestors": Most of us no longer believe in the theory that God created mankind. Where did the first organisms and humans evolve from? The protoplasm of all current organisms is a historical structure, so is it possible to artificially create life? These difficult questions are naturally topics that those who want to solve the mystery of life are willing to discuss. From blood type, physiology, psychology, intelligence, ... various characteristics prove that we and apes are distant cousins, closest to chimpanzees.

Chinese geologists excavated a type of most common primitive human fossil – "Peking Man" – in Pigeon Cave, Zhoukoudian, near Beijing. They are the ancestors of European early humans, and Asia is the cradle of the human race, the key to solving the origin of mankind. According to ethnologist Deniker, modern human races are divided into six main races, further divided into twenty-nine ethnic groups.

3. "Valuing Daughters Over Sons": Those who want to fully understand the key to reproduction and the question of who is more important for reproduction between men and women must read this popular "Experimental Embryology." The author says: The mission of the third volume is not only to supplement the inadequacies of the first volume, but also to go a step further, using analysis and experimental methods to explore the mechanical principles of early embryonic development; and to try to interfere with the actions of nature with artificial forces within a possible range. ...

From the superficial "sperm-only theory" and "egg-only theory," to analyzing the internal structure of sperm and egg cells, the theory of male-female cooperation began to be established at the end of the nineteenth century. Chapter 6 discusses "natural virgin reproduction." In nature, some subspecies of virgin reproduction (like bees, rotifers, aphids, etc.) can develop independently without fertilization. The eggs of some animals have already begun to develop independently, but cannot complete their evolution. Modern scholars have been able to use artificial methods to replace sperm, so that eggs can obtain "stimulation" and "modification" actions, develop independently, and eventually grow fatherless offspring. However, paternal creation and transmission must rely on sperm. The experimental parthenogenesis of human eggs is theoretically absolutely possible.

4. "Transformation of Male and Female": The decision of male and female is very early, but the exact timing and reasons for determination are still debated. Moreover, the boundaries between men and women are very fluid, and there are many examples of hermaphroditism (that is, men and women whose gender is doubtful). Biologists can use surgical operations to eliminate male and female sexual desires, and can also change the shape and characteristics of both sexes.

The effectiveness of "sex chromosomes" (heteromorphic sperm and isomorphic egg cells) in human reproductive cells initially changed from quality to quantity, and "ordinary chromosomes" are also related to determination; the X chromosome is a female genetic base. Sperm that produce boys (without X, or only with Y chromosomes) should have a slightly shorter lifespan than those with X, and they have different tolerances to temperature, chemicals, or poisons. In the future, it may be possible to use methods of injecting "male hormones" or "female hormones," or other compounds, to enable each couple to achieve satisfactory results.

(5) "The Origin of Knowledge": This starts from the lowest degree of psychology in the animal kingdom—sensation and taxis—and progresses to various reflexes, instincts, and the foundation of learning knowledge—memory. Through observation and measurement, the psychological functions of various animals are clarified; such as monkeys' color vision, insects' sense of smell, and the instincts and educational potential of birds and insects.

The Soviet Union has a diligent and persevering physiologist, Pavlov (J. Pavlov, 1848-1936), who dedicated his life to studying the problem of "conditioned reflexes," using scientific methods to analyze the human heart and dissect the will.

Appropriate education and appropriate training can enable animals to change their innate instincts and acquire acquired knowledge. All comfortable parasitic lives can only make the intelligence of parasites gradually degenerate, eventually becoming ignorant and losing freedom.

(6) "The Origin of Love": The reason for the occurrence of love is practical, physiological, and very important for the survival of the race, and it is by no means illusory. Sexual love is a physiological expression, with both parties being stimulated by sex hormones secreted by their bodies, but both men and women must exercise restraint in order to make the relationship between husband and wife last.

The diet of animals is related to the amount of sexual desire. From the promiscuous form of polygamy and polyandry, it evolved into a small family system of monogamy. And elaborate on the shortcomings of "polygyny" and "polyandry."

A mother's concern for her children often makes her forget her own love. The development and prosperity of the entire race are entrusted to "maternal love." In the future, it is urgent to promote scientific filial piety.

Science is becoming more prosperous, transportation is becoming more convenient, the relationship between people is becoming more extensive, and sympathy and social love are increasing. "Friendship" can transcend national and racial boundaries. It can even be extended not only to all mankind, but also to those animals that have been in contact with humans for a long time.

### Review of "New Poetry Talk"

— Lu Chi

"When we stand in front of a work of art and want to study it from a scientific point of view, we have two different paths. On the one hand, if the work of art is a sculpture, we can describe the work; if the work of art is a poem, we can describe the essence of its content; we do such descriptions, and the entirety of these purely external descriptions constitutes art history. On the other hand, we can study the foundation of the work, that is, find out what are the social and personal origins of the work, what ideas guided its creator, what is its meaning, its relationship to the social environment, its effect on the people; we must make such explanations and art criticisms, and give the artistic results a correct critique and evaluation, then as an artistic department in this area, it will have the possibility of complete development, and at the same time its development path can be clearly understood."

The above is a paragraph from the beginning of Ikeweichi's famous book "Literary Theory of Historical Materialism." He tells us that in any artistic department, in addition to the works of art itself, we also have to ask for historical works on the development of this art from a vertical perspective, and from a horizontal perspective, we hope to have insightful and profound art criticism to give the artistic achievements a correct criticism and evaluation. Then, as an art department in this area, it will have the possibility of complete development, and at the same time its development path can be clearly understood.

"Poetry," this is the highest creative thing as an art department, it needs "poetry history," it needs "poetry criticism," obviously it is far beyond other departments of art. However, we know that in the Chinese poetry world, the work of poetry history and poetry criticism has always been neglected. If we compare poetic creation with poetic theoretical criticism and poetic historical work, then the latter has been done too little. Obviously, this will have an adverse impact on the entire poetic movement.

According to the statistics of many editors of literary supplements, poems account for the absolute majority of the unsolicited manuscripts they receive, but the number of poems that can be published, on the contrary, also accounts for the absolute minority. The reason for this is that the authors do not have a sufficient understanding of the true meaning of poetry.

However, we must know that New Poetry has been tried since it was started under a historical necessity, and it has been more than twenty years. Looking back, it is true that we have gone through tortuous, difficult, and complicated paths – even detours! Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, many poets were still trapped in the extreme depression of groping and hesitating in terms of content and form. Then, as a young writer of literary studies, his understanding of poetry, his understanding of the tasks of poetry work, is even less of a problem?

Since Ai Qing wrote "Poetry Theory" and Huang Mian wrote "On Poetry," there are indeed two books of theoretical books instructing poetry workers in the current poetry world. The former is a collection of poems in the form of Sichuan poetry, and the content is biased towards conceptual aspects. The latter is a collection of poems that use concrete poetic materials to explain the artistic conception of poetry. In some occasions, it is easier to understand than the conceptual "Poetry Theory," but sometimes it is not necessarily able to make beginners understand because the examples are profound. But what a contribution the presentation of such poetry theoretical work should have to the Chinese New Poetry movement!

Now the author wants to introduce a third more noteworthy collection of poetry theory and poetry history, which is Mr. Ren Jun's "New Poetry Talk" recently published by "New China Press."

"New Poetry Talk" is a collection of poetry theory and criticism articles written by Mr. Ren over the past ten years. It collects seventeen articles.

The first essay, "Poetry Chat," takes the same method as Ai Qing's "Poetry Theory," using short sentences to describe and explain the nature of poetry. According to Ikeweichi's requirements, it is an article belonging to the aspect of art criticism.

The second and third "New Poetry Talk," he started with the "Collection of Attempts" by Hu Shi, who first tried to write new poetry, and made a general introduction to the poems of Guo Moruo, Xu Zhimo, Zhu Xiang, Bing Xin, etc. This also fulfilled Ikeweichi's requirements, and he can belong to the department of art history.

Theory and criticism are the compass of action. Both the author and the readers of "New Poetry Talk" need him eagerly! In this regard, "New Poetry Talk" gives us detailed information on the historical development of poetry, and also gives us a correct understanding of the theory and criticism of poetry. Inheriting the instructions of the above three collections, we—young friends who love poetry—have books with theoretical basis for poetry when we first start practicing writing poetry. In other words: "When our poets start writing, they can already know how to choose life themes, how to deal with them, how to insert writing and performance, and how to make the form and content consistent... And more importantly, we can also know what kind of poems poetry workers should write in the current society. The era of Hu Shi's poetry has passed, and the era of Zhu Xiang and Xu Zhimo's poetry has also passed. What is presented to us is a newer era, which is changing and developing with the changes and development of the national society, and will also change and develop with the changes and development of Chinese society. If the so-called new era is not an empty and beautiful noun, then "the current trend of Chinese new poetry is to use the lofty and simple prose of free verse, abandoning the feudal constraints of rhyme and meter, as the form; the content is to use a rich, realistic, close and profound observation, breaking through all personal sickly sighs and efforts to work for the pale gaze of the realm of joy."

### Word Talk of Water Margin

— Ye Dejun

Although there are various different versions of Water Margin we see today, in addition to the later 120-chapter and 70-chapter versions, there are only two types with complex characters. All kinds of simplified versions are excerpted from the complex versions, and the stories of conquering Tian Hu and Wang Qing are added separately. The 100-chapter complex version is the ancestor of the 120-chapter version and various simplified versions. It is also rumored to be from the hand of Guo Xun, Marquis of Wuding, during the Jiajing period. This version is the most ancient among the existing popular versions.

What was the form of Water Margin before the 100-chapter version?

Regarding the answer to this question, the opinions of scholars differ. Hu Shi's "New Study of Water Margin" assumes that there are X, Y, and Z versions. Mr. Zheng Xidi's "Evolution of Water Margin" assumes that there is a Luo Guanzhong version that is different from the existing versions.

Mr. Sun Zishu's "Speculation on the Old Version of Water Margin from the 100-Chapter Version of Water Margin Hidden by the Li Family of Gaoyang" (published in the 25th to 27th issues of Popular Literature edited by Brother Wang Shu in the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily in 1941) believes that the Water Margin before the 100-chapter version was a Word Talk version compiled by the Southern Book Society in the Yuan Dynasty. He said:

"The change of the Word Talk version to a prose version seems to be after the Hongzhi and Zhengde periods of the Ming Dynasty and before the Jiajing period. The current 100-chapter Water Margin should be from Guo Xun's version in the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. Guo's version should be from the old version before the Jiajing period." However, the existence of the old version before the Jiajing period between Guo's version and the Word Talk version has not been explained. According to a poem of praise in the 48th chapter of the 100-chapter version (the same in the 120-chapter version), describing the scene of the Zhu Family Village seen by Song Jiang, he determined that the words were the words of praise, and they were closely integrated with the upper and lower parts. He determined that this was from the Word Talk of the old version, and was a "fossil" that was not eliminated when the Word Talk version was changed to the prose version.

Sun's statement is quite accurate, but the evidence cited is only an isolated proof from the original book. When I was examining old books, I accidentally found two collateral proofs for him, which are enough to show that Water Margin did come from the Word Talk version. One is Xu Wei's "Lost Manuscripts of Xu Wenchang" Volume 4 "Preface to the Poem of Lu Bu's Residence":

"...At the beginning, the village blind man learned extremely vulgar novels, based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and the same as the current Water Margin, it was a Word Talk for ballad singing." According to Xu Wei, what he was referring to was the story of Lu Bu and Diao Chan, which he thought came from the Word Talk sung by the blind man, similar to the Water Margin Word Talk sung at that time. Although this is a statement of comparing this with that, it can be inferred from this statement that in Xu Wei's time (Jiajing period), both the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin had Word Talk. The second is Qian Xiyan's "Playful Flaws" (borrowed from the Yue Shan Fang Collection) Volume 1:

"At the beginning of each Word Talk book, there is a section for inviting guests, which is regarded as a past victory market return. This is exactly the wonderful point of the Song people borrowing this form to describe that, creating something out of nothing. The roaming words and generalized rhymes are popular and well-known, and those who are not deeply versed in Ci poetry cannot be told about it. Not only are miscellaneous talks like this, but the entire Water Margin also has it in each chapter, completely learning the style of Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian. Wen Zhengming and other gentlemen liked to listen to people talk about Song Jiang in their spare time, first talking about the 'stall head' for half a day, and Gongfu (Gongfu is Qian Xiyan's name) still had time to hear about it. The current engraved version in the market is the book after Guo Wuding deleted it. Guo was a high-ranking official, and his style was like a strange horse to Ci poets, so all the strange words were cut off, and he was truly a sinner of the Shi family." Although this statement refers to the "stall head" (that is, the introduction), but it said earlier that each Word Talk book has the "victory market return" (introduction), and later said that "even the entire Water Margin has it in each chapter," then the Water Margin referred to should also be the Word Talk version. Wen Zhengming was a person from the Zhengde and Jiajing periods, and Qian Xiyan was a person from the Longqing and Wanli periods. They had both heard the singing Water Margin Word Talk, and Qian had also seen the Water Margin of the Word Talk version, which is sufficient to prove that the Water Margin Word Talk version was widely circulated in the middle and late Ming Dynasty.

A few years ago, a fragment of Water Margin published in Jiajing was discovered. The characters are different from the popular version, preserving the unique style of the Word Talk version. The discovery of this Jiajing version is even more proof that the older version of Water Margin is the Word Talk version. This has been transformed from speculation into an undoubted fact.

### Two Chapters of Prose

— Su Fan

Flowers

Those bright, those exaggerated, those flower buds that want to make a lot of noise! Now they are presented before my eyes again.

In spring, when I open the window, I will always see flowers as wide as the sea, spreading in all directions.

Spring is the season for flowering. All kinds of flowers bloom in the fields; bloom on the cliffs; bloom in the dreams of travelers; bloom in the hearts of girls.

In the days without flowers, people love to dream flower-like dreams, and the dreams of young wanderers are even more beautiful and dazzling, dreaming that spring flowers are scattered all over the fields; spring flowers are attached to the pink cheeks of girls; dreaming that hope is in full bloom like flowers; and also dreaming of the journey of life paved with flowers, that is flat, dazzling...

However, flowers are also fragile and impermanent after all. How many people sigh at the blooming and withering of flowers; how many people realize the illusion of life from here. When the blooming flowers outside the window begin to wither, isn't autumn about to approach? How can autumn bloom? ...

The season of flowers is short, and the dream of flowers is even shorter.

In the past days, I had a life that was too young, and colorful flowers bloomed in my childish heart in my dreams. After countless autumns, on the long muddy journey, the whip of reality shattered the ostentatious flowers blooming in my dreams. Now, I dare not open the dusty memory of flowers again.

Now, spring flowers are blooming proudly in front of the window again, but my small window is still tightly closed.

Bridge

In remote rural areas, and in noisy cities, we will see bridges, all kinds of bridges.

Bridge, the crystallization of the highest intelligence of mankind!

I have also dreamed of bridges as magnificent as the pyramids in the Egyptian desert. This great bridge is built in people's hearts.

This is a bridge made of thoughts and emotions. Whoever has the confidence to build a bridge will build it in whose heart.

But this bridge is not ideal or perfect. Sometimes, when emotions flood the bridge surface, everyone knows that we can simply row a boat under the bridge, and the bridge will be bigger and wider.

The century of the people will be the century of bridge building. Good bridge builders will also be good people.

### Poetry Talk

— Wu Tun Wu

The great French poet Chu Lexi said: "The person who wants to describe his dream must be particularly sober himself."

If the poet does not have his own muse of truth, goodness and beauty, does not have a pen as sharp as a sword and as red as fire, does not have a heart full of sorrow, resentment and anger, does not have the enthusiasm and dominance of life's struggle, or even does not have the proper limit of emotional stretching and empathy, then, what a ridiculous thing it is!

### Monkey and Man

— Written by M. Gorky, Translated by Shi Heng

— One of the Russian Vignettes

Professor Z, a bacteriologist, once told me the following story.

"One day, I was talking to General B and accidentally mentioned that I wanted to find a monkey for an experiment. The general immediately said very seriously:

"How about Jews - are they not good? I have caught a few Jews here, spies who are about to be hanged - if they are useful to you, you are welcome to take them away."

Without waiting for my reply, he sent a messenger to see how many spies were waiting for execution.

"I tried to explain to the adult that humans are not suitable for my experiment, but he simply could not understand what I meant, and said with wide eyes:

"Yes, but humans are smarter than monkeys, aren't they? If you inject a person with poison, he will tell you all his feelings, but a monkey will not speak."

"At this time, the messenger walked in and reported that there was not a single Jew among the arrested spies - they were Romanians and Bohemians."

"How terrible!" the general said, "I don't think Bohemians are good either? ... How terrible! ..."

### The Philosophy of Love

— Shelley, Translated by Tian Qin

The fountains mingle with the river

And the rivers with the ocean,

The winds of heaven mix for ever

With a sweet emotion;

Nothing in the world is single;

All things by a law divine

In one another’s being mingle—

Why not I with thine?

See! the mountains kiss high heaven,

And the waves clasp one another;

No sister-flower would be forgiven

If it disdain’d its brother;

And the sunlight clasps the earth,

And the moonbeams kiss the sea—

What are all these kissings worth,

If thou kiss not me?

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 160

— Ye Jingfeng

Seeing Hejian looking very anxious, I comforted him, saying, "Anxiety is useless. Anyway, 'Zero-One-Two' will definitely reply within ten hours, and the matter will be settled..."

"Got it!" Hejian, seemingly thinking about something, immediately jumped to the desk, grabbed a pen and started scribbling on the notebook on the desk, sheet after sheet. After a while, he finished writing, pressed the electric bell, called the orderly, and handed me the two written slips of paper to look at:

"Tokyo General Staff Headquarters Seventy-Two, Nakamura Pingzi, which group, which number? Nakajima Kaneko, which group, which number? Urgent reply, Zhiping, Two-One-Five."

Looking at the second sheet, it was the same telegram, but the recipient was "Shen General Headquarters One-Zero-Two." This "One-Zero-Two" was said to be our "Zero-Two," named He Shengtianta Lang, a very capable assistant. After reading these two telegrams, I knew that Hejian had shifted the "eight" secret from a geographical problem to a problem of people. After a while, our orderly took the telegrams away.

"Do you know?" Hejian asked me, "Nakajima Kaneko is the 'Manchurian Female Dog' in Pingzi's mouth... But this is just a guess. I don't believe this woman is so formidable. I suspect that the 'eight secret' is Pingzi herself!"

"Didn't she personally instruct you to pay attention to 'eight'? How can one deliberately ask people to pay attention to oneself?" I reminded him.

"Old brother, do you understand the word 'smoke screen'? Doesn't strategy say, 'The empty is the real, the real is the empty, the empty is empty and real, the real is real and empty, so that it cannot be predicted.' How do you know Pingzi isn't deliberately making trouble?"

"I also remembered a sentence. Didn't you intentionally want me to take a trip to Tokyo? Is it to deal with Pingzi?"

"You guessed it right." Hejian laughed, "You know, Pingzi is a China fanatic. She wants to learn Chinese and write Chinese poems, so she even gave herself a Chinese name called Liu Shi. At that time, I didn't quite understand her background. I thought she was just a female member of the Black Dragon Society, at most a spy. I took the opportunity to promote you a lot, saying that you are all-powerful and your mysterious guard is very deep..."

While Hejian was speaking, he paced around the room. Suddenly, he glanced at his watch, immediately jumped out of the door, pressed the electric bell, grabbed his hat, and shouted at me, "It's late, let's go, Lao Yue!"

"Where to?" I stared in surprise.

"Have you forgotten? It's five o'clock. Didn't you say that at five o'clock, you can go to Xiehe to see your friend from Changxindian, Engineer Wu Dingyuan?"

"Oh, I meant that every afternoon at five o'clock, the hospital allows relatives and friends of patients to visit. I didn't know you were going today."

"Let's go," Hejian commanded. "Anyway, there's nothing to do here. Besides, I'm very worried about him. It's a pity that such a good person was ruined by Japanese ruffians!"

I had just put cigarettes and other small items in my pocket and picked up my hat when Hejian was about to open the door. Coincidentally, someone knocked gently on the door twice. Hejian opened the door. I turned around and saw three people standing in a straight line at the door. The one at the front was Miss Ji Qun, who was as delicate as a flower but also heroic. She had taken off her military uniform and changed into a white-bottomed blue-flowered cheongsam, which highlighted the beauty of her femininity. I had never seen Pingzi, so I didn't know how beautiful she was. In my opinion, Ji Qun's appearance would not lose to Pingzi by half, perhaps even a little better.

### A Smile Breaks the Face

— Mai Jixian

An American politician once said: "If you want to be the President of the United States, you must first learn to smile." Yes, the late President Roosevelt always had a smiling face during his lifetime. In addition, the mayor of Wu Guo is said to always greet guests with a smile, so he not only earns people's "respect," but also their "love."

A liking for smiling faces is human nature. The stores we like are those where the staff greet us with a smile, the children we like are always those who laugh easily, and the friends we welcome are those who are cheerful and able to make everyone happy. In the mutual pleasure of men and women, laughter is the most important ingredient, because it can increase the man's kindness and the woman's charm.

Laughter is the medium for connecting hearts. "Looking at each other and smiling, forgetting each other in heart," what a touching situation. Many feuds and many disputes in the world are resolved by laughter. Moreover, laughter itself is a kind of beauty, and often, for the sake of one or two people's smiles, the whole room comes alive with spring. "A smile topples a city, another smile topples a country," the magic of laughter is evident here.

As the saying goes, "Even without offense, the face is hateful." People with hateful faces are those who do not understand the technique of smiling. There is also a saying: "There is no intention to reject people, but there is a color of rejection," presuming that it means a lack of inclination to smile.

Technically, the highest level of smiling is to make the other person smile at you. If you have this ability, whether you smile or not is no longer a question. There are many masters of humor in the world, such as Mark Twain, etc., or people who are good at socializing, and they can all make the other person laugh until they lean back and forth.

There are many difficult situations, awkward occasions, and sad things in the world that are alleviated and opened up by "laughter." For example, facing today's China, as ordinary people, they naturally have no choice but to smile; otherwise, what good would a grieving face do in reality? Being able to maintain a smile in extremely difficult circumstances, that kind of smile is a rare strength!

### Big and Small Have Problems It Just Depends on How You Solve Them

— Written by Ernest Dichter, Translated and Abridged by Chen Xiang

We all have problems. We all suffer from emotional pain, fear, and disappointment. The purpose of this article is to help you recognize problems and solve smaller ones. We should all have sufficient psychological knowledge to solve simpler problems, just as everyone should know how to treat a cold and a headache.

Self-Consciousness

Everyone knows self-consciousness, which is perfectly normal. But if it seriously controls us, it becomes bad. A person who cannot speak in front of the boss, a bride whose tongue is tied in front of her mother-in-law, unpleasant shyness, even exaggerated, intimidating appearances—all are symptoms of self-consciousness.

If you are one of these people, what can you do? If it's not too serious, if you know how to do it, if you decide to do it, you can solve your problem yourself.

There was a young red-haired man who was acutely sensitive to his red hair. He didn't like it. He was convinced that his peers looked down on him for it. Soon, his red hair made him a bad self-conscious person.

One day, he noticed that a lecturer liked to mention him because he had red hair. He began to feel that being "different" might be an infinite advantage. So, he studied harder and became the best student in the class. Finally, he began to devote himself to "red," using his hair as a personal symbol. He studied and worked to make his career as prominent as his color. He succeeded—he solved the problem for himself.

The reason why this young man was able to solve his problem was because he was able to recognize the problem and turn harm into benefit.

Excessive Fear

We all have things we fear. Children fear things they don't love. They are afraid of the dark, water, or wild animals. Adults also have fears, although they may not openly express them.

There was a woman who was trained to be a singer, but she was paralyzed by a fear of the audience. Every time she was about to perform, she would have a cold, making her unable to go on stage—this was clearly a means of escape. After this happened several times, she recognized the trick her subconscious was playing. The next time, although she still had a fear of the audience, although her nose and throat were still constrained by the "cold," she forced herself to go on stage and sing. She refused the means of escape invented by her subconscious.

Finally, she overcame her phobia, and the "cold" no longer occurred. She mustered her courage and cured her difficulty.

### Natural Philosophy

— Jiayuan

Eyeglasses

A great contributor to mankind, saving the nearsighted and also the farsighted, putting them in just the right place; but for the all-sighted, what can you do?

Paste

It always wants to bring people together, but it is squeezed into the cracks itself.

Glass Showcase

God creates the tragedy of life, and the glass showcase expresses the tragedy of life so succinctly. Many of the colorful things that people hope for in their hearts are hidden behind it, but they are unattainable.

High Tension

We all have our temperament, our emotions, and our decline. Usually, unpleasant temperaments do not last. We use simple courage—a secret to life.

The main purpose of this article is to give you the ability to help you solve smaller problems. If self-analysis can be of some use to you, you must accompany knowledge with some personal characteristics. Those characteristics are: courage to face the world and face yourself; an attitude of resistance to the world and to yourself; the ability to conquer problems; and the ability to take moderate offense.

Furthermore, you must put knowledge into practice. If you are unwilling to help yourself, even the best knowledge is useless.

### Chinese Textbook

— Zhong Zhi

The newspaper reported: "The Chinese University textbook will be published by the two major bookstores, Zhengzhong and Commercial Press." Except for a group of young masters and misses who are proud of holding foreign books, who will take it lightly, all students who are sincerely learning will be overjoyed.

But there are a few points that we want to ask.

The first point to ask is: How fast? Don't see the news today and see the actual textbook five years later, then it's not worth mentioning.

The second point to ask is: Is it used? Don't have a Chinese University textbook, but our professors still follow the same style, "Original" first!

The third point to ask is: Is it broad enough? Don't have many subjects missing, and students still have to rely on English books.

The fourth point to ask is: Is the terminology unified? Don't have multiple meanings for one term or multiple translations for one word, making it unclear.

If the university textbook can satisfactorily solve these points, we will not only celebrate for ourselves: From now on, China's new culture will be further promoted and developed.

### Shanghai is About to Collapse

— Yu Feng

The Waibaidu Bridge has become a key thoroughfare for north-south traffic on the Suzhou River, but it has been in disrepair for years. After a detailed inspection by the Public Works Bureau, it was found that the bridge abutment had sunk and tilted, causing cracks, and the bureau has also formulated a rescue plan, preparing for processing and repairs. (See the report on the 31st of last month)

The tilting of the Waibaidu Bridge does not seem to be a recent event, as this phenomenon occurred several months ago; the reason for this is that the Broadway Mansion on the bridge approach is too heavy, causing the land to sink. As a result, the Waibaidu Bridge's footing is not solid, making it very easy to tilt.

If the Waibaidu Bridge is not repaired and left to its own devices, it is likely to collapse suddenly after a considerable period of time.

However, is the entire Shanghai not sinking all the time? Of course, the decline of education, economy, and other industries, as well as the recession of industry and commerce, are also contributing to the collapse of Shanghai's prosperity, and in fact, the ground in Shanghai is indeed sinking. It is said that since the Anti-Japanese War, the ground in Shanghai has sunk an average of eight or nine inches, and an average of nearly one inch per year; calculated in this way, if the land in Shanghai is more than fourteen feet higher than the Wusong Sea, Shanghai may become a swamp in more than one hundred and forty years.

Although more than one hundred and forty years seems to be too long for Shanghai people who pursue reality, the subsidence of the ground in various parts of the city is not uniform due to different loads and soil qualities, which has caused many buildings—International Hotel, Thirteen-Story Building, Broadway Mansion, etc.—to have a tendency to tilt, and the land will also be uneven due to different degrees of subsidence; if one of them suddenly collapses due to a large tilt, what will happen?

If the fate arranged by God cannot be changed by humans, in more than a hundred years, this prosperous international metropolis of Shanghai may become a gathering place for angelfish and the like, still allowing the fish and shrimp to live their leisurely maritime life, and only the upper half of the high-rise buildings that have always been envied will be exposed on the turbulent sea surface, allowing the people of that time to observe them as a historical miracle. But if "man can conquer nature," perhaps at that time, a dike higher than the Berlin Wall will have been built around Shanghai, and the sea water will be hitting the edge of the dike, allowing people to live in the depths of the seabed.

### Selling Live Eyes

The illustration shows a 51-year-old woman from Pennsylvania, USA, with twelve children, who, unable to make a living, is willing to sell one of her live eyes to the highest bidder; the other one will also be sold upon her death. "This is for the future life of my good grandchildren," she said. The child in the picture is her five-month-old granddaughter. (Special contract with the New York Times)
