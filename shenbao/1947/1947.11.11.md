### Generalissimo Instructs Party Members to Concentrate Efforts on Mobilizing to Save the People, Fulfilling Duties and Not Taking Pride in Election

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] At 9:00 AM on the 10th, Generalissimo Chiang presided over the weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at the Central Party Headquarters. After the ceremony, he gave brief instructions regarding the responsibilities of party members and participation in elections, stating: "Currently, the communist bandits have not yet been suppressed, the people's suffering has not yet been alleviated, and the Three Principles of the People have not yet been realized. Comrades of our party should constantly remember their revolutionary responsibilities and devote all their efforts to the work of rescuing the nation from its crisis and relieving the people's suffering. I have repeatedly received tearful appeals from people victimized in areas recovered by our national army, as well as reports from officers and soldiers at the front lines who have witnessed firsthand the cruelty of the communist bandits and the suffering of the people in the bandit-controlled areas. The reality is far beyond what those of us safely in the rear can imagine. In the bandit-controlled areas, all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 58 are coerced into becoming 'militia' to replenish the bandit troops. They receive no training and are simply ordered to charge into battle to die. Once these able-bodied men are drafted into the 'militia,' they know that they have no hope of surviving more than three months. Yet, under their deception and cruel oppression, how can they escape? They can only feel regret, but it is too late. Therefore, in the Lu Zhong and Jiao Dong areas where our national army arrives, there is often no trace of human habitation for hundreds of miles. Recently, in Henan and other places, professors and the families of students in major universities and schools who are in the bandit-controlled areas have suffered unspeakable tortures and punishments from the communist bandits' 'cleansing' and 'struggle' campaigns. In addition to having their fathers, brothers, and sons turned into 'militia,' their sisters and daughters are forced into the communist army's 'comfort corps,' enduring all sorts of shameless and brutal acts that defy description. I can confidently say that if these inhumane communist bandits are not swiftly annihilated, then in three years, there will be no survivors left in the provinces of North China. Our party bears the responsibility of implementing the Three Principles of the People, building the nation, and saving our compatriots. Now that the communist bandits are rampant and the nation and people are suffering such a catastrophe, all party members must concentrate their efforts, strive hard, and not hesitate to sacrifice or endure hardship in order to quell the great chaos and save the people. Aside from the work of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, all personal honors and positions should not be considered at this time, lest we divert our focus and weaken our strength. Therefore, regarding the issue of elections, I believe that party members, except for those who are decided by the party to participate in the elections, should all focus on the work of mobilizing for the suppression of the rebellion, in order to contribute to the military efforts against the bandits. In particular, comrades in all party, government, and military departments who bear practical responsibilities should, with the spirit of 'worrying about the world's troubles before others and enjoying the world's pleasures after others,' dedicate themselves to their duties. They should not only not take pride in being elected, but also understand that participating in elections at this time and abandoning the responsibilities of a revolutionary party member is a disgrace to a revolutionary party member. This will allow us to leave more seats for friends from other parties and enlightened members of society to participate in politics. We must understand that constitutionalism and suppressing the rebellion are equally important, but suppressing the rebellion is the foundation for constitutionalism. We should fulfill our revolutionary responsibilities and not fight for personal rights. Only in this way can we demonstrate the spirit of our party comrades being selfless and sincere for the country and the people, and only then can we fulfill our party's mission of implementing the Three Principles of the People and building the nation."

### List of National Assembly Representative Candidates from the Kuomintang and Youth Party, Measures for Overseas Chinese Elections Modified by Government Order

(This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 10th) The list of Kuomintang and Youth Party candidates for the National Assembly representatives was released by the Election Headquarters at 6:00 PM on the 10th. The list of the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet been released as it is still being negotiated. The Kuomintang's complete list includes a total of 1,758 names, including various candidates from 22 provinces, 10 cities, and 5 special groups. The Youth Party's list includes a total of 288 people from 20 provinces, 7 cities, and 4 special groups. The Election Headquarters immediately notified the election offices of each province and county by telegram, and also sent express mail to notify them of the released list. Furthermore, the list released today includes candidates from each province, city, and occupational group, but does not include those from the pacification zones and overseas Chinese. For Taiwan Province, the Kuomintang adopted a free election method, while the Youth Party nominated three candidates, which were released at the same time today. (The Kuomintang's list is on the first page, and the Youth Party's list is on the third page, left corner.)

(This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 10th) The list of Democratic Socialist Party candidates for the National Assembly representatives has not yet been finalized. Wu Tiecheng is in Shanghai negotiating with Zhang Junmai, but no conclusion has been reached. Wang Shixian of the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th, and then visited Chen Lifu with Xu Fulin and Yang Junming to exchange opinions. In the evening, Chen Lifu and Zheng Yanfen visited Xu again, but after several rounds of negotiations, no conclusion was reached.

### Jiang Yuntian Takes List to Nanjing, Insists on 260 Candidates, Lei Zhen Travels with Jiang

(Central News Agency, this city dispatch) The Democratic Socialist Party continues to insist on its previously proposed list of 260 National Assembly representative candidates. The original list was taken to Nanjing by Jiang Yuntian on the evening of the 10th. Before leaving, Jiang told reporters, "The result of the negotiations in Nanjing this time was that the number of candidates nominated by our party was reduced from 260 to 290, and some important figures in our party were removed. After repeated discussions within our party, we believe that it is difficult to accept this, so we have decided to submit the original list. If it still cannot be approved, then our party will have to withdraw from the election."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] It is reported that after the Kuomintang returned the list previously nominated by the Democratic Socialist Party for reconsideration and decided to increase the number of candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party by 15, the party still insisted that there were more than 30 "important figures" in certain regions who must be included as candidates. The Kuomintang side believes that the candidates already proposed in these regions are all outstanding party members, so it has stated that it cannot make any further concessions, but it has agreed to make concessions in certain regions, to which the Democratic Socialist Party replied that there were no suitable candidates to be nominated. According to reliable sources, the Democratic Socialist Party has 191 candidates arranged by the Kuomintang, and the remaining vacancies have been promised to be filled in the pacification zones. However, the Democratic Socialist Party still insists on its request to add more than 30 more candidates, which has led to several rounds of negotiations without reaching an agreement.

### Kuomintang Spokesperson Discusses Assisting Allied Parties in Elections

[Another dispatch] A Kuomintang spokesperson stated: "The list submitted by the Kuomintang this time has gone through the procedures of reporting at the county level, review at the provincial level, and a bottom-up process. Finally, it was solemnly decided by the central government, which was a complicated process that took a lot of time. In order to facilitate the election of candidates from allied parties, the Kuomintang had to repeatedly discuss almost every region before reaching an appropriate solution. One characteristic of the list submitted by the Kuomintang this time is that it includes comrades from various industries and fields in various places, which will inevitably reduce their chances of participating in the election. This spirit of valuing national interests and sacrificing the individual should be praised by the people. The Generalissimo of our party will give them separate commendations to honor their virtue of concession."

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 10th] Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election Headquarters, met with reporters at the Election Headquarters at 6:00 PM on the 10th after announcing the list of Kuomintang and Youth Party National Assembly representative candidates, and gave a speech stating: The government has three hopes for the elections in various places: 1. Establish good order, 2. Implement government laws and regulations, 3. Express the will of the people. If the election agencies at all levels can achieve these three hopes, then the election and voting can proceed smoothly and achieve a democratic election. Zhang added: The lists of the Kuomintang and Youth Party announced today are those that were submitted first and will be announced first. Those that continue to be submitted will be released successively in the future.

Zhang also said: According to the provisions of the Election Law, only those who have registered and legally signed can be candidates, and non-candidates cannot participate in the election. Currently, in addition to the nominations by political parties, there are still more than 20,000 people legally nominated in various places. As of now, there are also about 10,000 legally registered occupational groups.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the election of overseas Chinese, due to various difficulties, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is now ordered by the National Government to modify the measures. If the place of residence of the overseas Chinese can legally hold elections, it will be held in accordance with the law, otherwise, it will be postponed.

### On the Procedural Issues of the German Peace Conference, Our Foreign Ministry Issues a Statement: Shall not be deemed valid without the consent of our government.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the report that the Soviet representative opposed the proposal by Britain, France, and the United States that China should be a co-convener of the German Peace Conference at the meeting of the deputies of the four foreign ministers in London, the Foreign Ministry issued the following statement on the evening of the 10th in response to inquiries from reporters: "On November 5th of this year, the Chinese government reiterated its repeatedly stated position on convening the German Peace Conference to the four countries of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. China believes that although the drafting of various European peace treaties has been designated by the Potsdam Agreement to be undertaken by the countries that signed the surrender terms, the organization of the peace conference and which country should convene it have never been authorized to any member of the Council of Foreign Ministers to handle on its own, so it should be decided jointly by the entire Council of Foreign Ministers. The Chinese government's position on this matter has always been supported by Britain, France, and the United States, which shows that it is fair and reasonable. As a member of the Council of Foreign Ministers, China insists on participating in the decision of all procedural issues regarding the German Peace Conference. Any resolution shall not be deemed valid without the consent of the Chinese government."

### Marshall Plans Economic Aid to China, Drafts Concrete Proposals for Submission to Congress

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall, in a hearing before the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress on the 10th, in addition to requesting Congress to provide $597,000,000 in emergency aid to Europe before March 31st, announced that he is drafting a "concrete proposal for economic aid to China" for early submission. Marshall made this statement in response to questions from Republican leaders who demanded that China be included in any temporary aid plan. While most of Marshall's report concerned European issues, he emphasized: "The situation in China continues to be of deep concern to us, and we should provide some economic aid and assistance to its government and people." Marshall also stated, "The United States and other major world powers recognize President Chiang's National Government as the sole legitimate government of China." This is reportedly the first statement by a principal member of the U.S. government regarding U.S. policy towards China.

Regarding the China portion, the full text of Marshall's report is as follows: "The situation in China continues to deeply concern us. The civil war is expanding and intensifying. The Chinese Communists are using weapons to attempt to control vast areas of China. The United States and all major world powers recognize the National Government of China as the sole legitimate government of China. Only the Chinese government and people can resolve its fundamental problems and restore China to its rightful position as a major stabilizing force in the Far East." However, we can still provide assistance. Given our long-standing, continuous record of friendship and cooperation with China, we should provide some economic aid to the Chinese people and government. A concrete proposal is being drafted for early submission.

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 10th Broadcast: Washington report, Marshall, in his address to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress, did not specify the amount or timing of the aid plan for China. However, Under Secretary of State Lovett told reporters that he doubted the aid proposal would be submitted to a special session of Congress. Lovett indicated that the aid plan would include short-term assistance.

Editorial

### Expectations for the Post-Relief Affairs Committee —May It Not Repeat the Mistakes of UNRRA and CNRRA—

The Post-Relief Affairs Committee, which will take over the remaining matters after the closure of UNRRA and CNRRA, has had its organizational regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan. At the same time, before General Rooks, the Director of UNRRA, returned to his country, he told reporters: "The relief work of UNRRA and CNRRA will end on December 31st of this year. After the closure, the post-relief work, in addition to the establishment of a Post-Relief Affairs Committee by the Chinese government, will also be jointly managed by a Custody Committee separately established with five members each from Chinese officials, social elites, and foreign personnel. Most of the remaining relief materials after the closure of UNRRA and CNRRA will be transferred to the Post-Relief Affairs Committee. A portion, such as fishing boats and fishing equipment, will be sold to private enterprises. The CNRRA Highway Transportation Administration and Water Transportation Administration will be closed simultaneously with CNRRA, while the Air Transport Administration's fate is yet to be decided." It is evident that the United Nations' relief efforts in China still require the Chinese government to handle the aftermath.

The biggest problem in Chinese administration is that each department only focuses on vertical systems and does not cooperate horizontally. Because of the vertical system, the affiliated enterprises become all-encompassing, but in the whole system, there is a sense of redundancy. Because of the unwillingness to cooperate horizontally, there are many unnecessary frictions and disputes between departments, and in terms of administrative efficiency, there is inevitably a waste of human and material resources. Even in terms of the administration and business of UNRRA and CNRRA, their scope of work should have been limited to the distribution of relief materials, but they insisted on handling the utilization of the materials themselves. For example, the reconstruction work in the flooded areas could have been delegated to the Ministry of Water Resources, with UNRRA or CNRRA consulting on the principles; the work of fisheries, mechanized farming, agricultural tool manufacturing, and rural industrial demonstration could have been entrusted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, with UNRRA or CNRRA assigning experts to provide guidance; the transportation and warehousing of materials could have been entrusted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Highway Administration, the Railway Administration, and the airline companies, with UNRRA or CNRRA strengthening their equipment. However, UNRRA and CNRRA did not do this, but insisted on handling all kinds of enterprises from beginning to end. What was the result? Now, as they are closing, we can review their past achievements and find various facts to prove that: the coordination was too poor, not only did it not achieve the effect of cooperation, but also caused unnecessary disputes, and many materials could not be fully utilized as a result. The enterprises they ran were too formalistic and lacked overall planning. Many temporary enterprises were discontinued due to their own closure, resulting in wasted efforts. Proportionally, administrative expenses were more than management expenses, and management expenses were more than enterprise expenses. Although there were some achievements, the cost was too high. There were too many guests and foreign entities. Many enterprises often became situations where the guest usurped the role of the host, hindering the advancement of the enterprise. If UNRRA and CNRRA had considered the consequences and had a good organization and reasonable scope at the time of their establishment, their achievements would have been more than this!

"Learn from the past to guide the future." As the Post-Relief Affairs Committee is about to replace UNRRA and CNRRA, the author dares to point out the past shortcomings and place expectations on the future. In terms of organization: In addition to the Post-Relief Affairs Committee, there is also a Advisory Custody Committee jointly responsible. Referring to the past organization, the relationship between the Advisory Custody Committee and the Post-Relief Affairs Committee seems to be the relationship between UNRRA and CNRRA, and referring to the organization of business institutions, it seems to be the supervisory board of a company. If the legislators believe this is necessary, they should also ensure that this Advisory Custody Committee only plays the role of approving and implementing principles, and should not be "jointly responsible" as General Rooks said, so that the staff will not have a sense of "three public officials in one country." It must be understood that multi-party checks and balances are the biggest obstacle to administration. It is hoped that the post-relief affairs will be changed for the better. In terms of administration: We demand to obtain the greatest results with the least human and material resources, especially in post-relief affairs. No matter what the source of funding is, increasing administrative efficiency by one point is equivalent to gaining one point of success for the enterprise, and saving one penny means that society gains one point of relief. The so-called undistributed relief materials must be distributed as soon as possible, and must not be left piled up in warehouses; the unfinished matters distributed in various places should be transferred to the local governments for separate handling, and no new institutions should be established to increase the burden of administrative expenses; guests and foreign entities should be retained if they should be retained, and should be dismissed if they can be dismissed, and should not be allowed to invest and disperse arbitrarily, consuming relief funds and causing them to complain. In terms of enterprises: The Post-Relief Affairs Committee does not need to handle permanent enterprises and enterprises managed by other departments. Because General Rooks's proposed "other matters such as fishing boats and fishing equipment in the fishing management area, except for a small portion reserved for the establishment of small fishing companies and related pier factories and repair shops, most of them will be sold to private enterprises in succession" plan really needs to be reconsidered. Other matters such as highway teams, water transportation teams, and air transportation teams should also be transferred to the business organizations under the Ministry of Communications as soon as possible, and there is no need to set up separate institutions after the closure to disperse the country's human and material resources. In short, since the Post-Relief Affairs Committee is responsible for continuing the distribution of relief materials, its work should focus on distribution. As for how to use them, if it only provides well-intentioned guidance, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort, so why bother to manage it all by itself?

Whether our administrative efficiency can be improved will be determined by this reorganization of the Post-Relief Affairs Committee.

### Case of Military Flour Transported to Tianjin, Three Supervisors File Impeachment

(Continued from the previous page) Briefly stated: Regarding Rong Yiren's part, Rong was entrusted by the government to purchase wheat and grind flour on its behalf. The labor and profit that each manufacturer should receive were stipulated in the contract. The government had already taken care of the interests of the manufacturers. However, Rong disregarded the contract stipulations and extracted too much wheat and second-grade flour, resulting in poor quality that was unfit for consumption. In addition, he swapped domestic flour for foreign flour, swapped foreign flour for navy flour, and violated the government's intention to purchase on its behalf by selling a portion of the wheat purchased on behalf to manufacturers. He disregarded the greater good, ignored the interests of the government, and engaged in trickery and embezzlement. He should be held criminally responsible, and it is proposed that he be handed over to the relevant court for investigation and prosecution. Regarding Ye Xinming's part, Ye did not ask about the quality of the flour milled by the Maoxin Company. When ordered to allocate military flour, he simply transferred the bill of lading issued by the company to the Shanghai-Hong Kong Port Command and directly extracted it from the manufacturer. He neglected his duties and did not fulfill his responsibilities. Furthermore, the flour did not meet the prescribed standards, but the director stated in his report to the Storage and Transportation Department of the Ministry of Food: "The color of this flour is slightly yellow, and the quality meets the standards prescribed by the Military Grain Quality Improvement Measures." He deliberately shielded the manufacturer. If he was not colluding for fraudulent purposes, why would he make such a false report? Not only was he derelict in his duties, but he was also in violation of the law. He should be held criminally responsible, and it is proposed that he also be handed over to the court for investigation. Regarding Shi Beiheng and Ju Zhiyi's parts, Shi and Ju were ordered to receive the flour, but they did not take it for inspection and shipped it directly. They were negligent and derelict in their duties. Their claim that there was no time for a thorough inspection and that they could only conduct spot checks was not supported by any official documents. Shi and Ju are highly suspected of fraud. It is proposed that they also be handed over to the relevant court for investigation and interrogation. Regarding Yu Zhongyun, ..., and Xian De's parts, Yu, ..., and Xian were ordered to jointly investigate this case, but they did not thoroughly investigate and clarify the responsibility for the case. They were negligent in their duties, and the flour composition stated in the report (which differed from what Engineer Li of Fuxin Company stated) constituted a report that was unfaithful to their duties due to following personal connections and disregarding facts. Their violations of law and dereliction of duty were serious. It is proposed that they be handed over to the relevant court for investigation and prosecution. Regarding the Ministry of Food's part, the ministry entrusted Maoxin Company's Rong Yiren to purchase a large amount of wheat and produce a large amount of flour on its behalf. Such a major matter should have been handled with caution and responsible supervision to avoid abuses. However, it entrusted Rong Yiren to handle it all by himself in a private entrusted manner. Its lack of careful supervision and failure to comply with the instructions of the former president to completely reform the flour production were also improper. It should be corrected.

### Xi'an Bank of China Hoarding Rice and Flour Seized

[Report from this Newspaper, Xi'an, 10th] The Xi'an branch of the Bank of China had more than 1,900 bags of government-stored rice and flour in its warehouse, and another 500 bags in a flour mill, which were seized by the Supervisory Commissioner of Jin-Shaan. The matter is currently under investigation.

### Limits on Japanese Industry, Chinese Reparations Committee Formulates Principles

[Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The issue of limiting the level of Japanese industry has been concluded after the Reparations Committee invited experts to conduct research. The basic principle is to limit the recovery of Japanese industry. The limit is not based on a specific year, but on the individual level of each industry. For example, the textile industry, the steel industry, and the kiln industry have been studied in detail by experts and subjected to strict limitations. This information will be used as a reference for the Chinese representatives when signing a peace treaty with Japan.

### Changes in the Flow of the Qiantang River, Seawall Project Progressing Smoothly, Report by Deputy Director Wang of the Seawall Engineering Bureau

[Report from this Newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] The Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau has been working for a year, and the projects in various places have achieved their expected goals. Deputy Director Wang reported at the commemorative meeting: On the north bank, from Jianshan in Haining to Jiuzhou ..., sand has been accumulated over eighty, eight miles wide, covering an area of 240,000 acres. The strong current along the seawall from Qibao to Toubao has been diverted 50 meters away from the seawall. On the south bank, the sand has accumulated over fifty miles long and six miles wide from Xinwan in Xiaoshan to Tou ..., covering an area of 110,000 acres, exceeding the land within the collapsed area. Nansha has been secured as a result. Now, the downstream flow of the Qiantang River has returned to the middle stream. During small tides, the water outside the seawall is less than an inch deep. During large tides, the tide head follows the center, and the remaining waves near the seawall are less than a foot high. This is a rare and favorable phenomenon in a hundred years. In the future, the governance project still needs to treat both the symptoms and the root causes. It is necessary to continue to repair the 2,700-meter-long damaged seawall and build diversion dikes and weirs to ensure that the accumulated sand beaches no longer change and that the formed channels do not shift.

### Chen Xueping Discusses Student Protests, Hopes to Maintain Stability of Schools

[Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Chen Xueping, head of the Youth Department, recently spoke about the current student protests, saying: The atmosphere in Nanjing is still relaxed. Zhongda only boycotted classes for one day, and Jin Da has already resumed classes. The problem is still in Zhejiang University itself. Education authorities have expressed dissatisfaction with Zhejiang University President Zhu's neutral attitude. In fact, Zhu has a long history of service in education and is a first-class president in the country. Chen is deeply concerned about conflicts between local military authorities and schools. He sincerely hopes that students can understand the situation, maintain the stability of the schools, and that the government will not take extreme measures against the schools.

### U.S. Congressional Foreign Affairs Committees Review Aid to Europe Marshall Personally Explains Emergency Aid Plan Requires $597 Million All Countries Must Provide Self-Help Guarantees

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Dispatch: Secretary of State Marshall addressed both the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees today, requesting that Congress allocate $597 million for emergency aid to Europe before March 31 of next year. He estimates that an additional $7 billion will be needed in the fifteen months after March 31. The long-term cost of European recovery will be between $16 billion and $20 billion. Marshall stated, "To restore Europe to its health is the goal of major powers (except the Soviet Union)." Marshall declared in a straightforward tone, "For its own reasons, the Soviet Union does not share this goal with us." Marshall's estimate of the long-term cost of aid to Europe is higher than that of the Harriman Committee report. The Harriman Committee's estimate for the four-year plan was $17 billion. Marshall said that it is currently impossible to estimate an accurate figure, but in order to "truly" meet the emergency needs of France, Italy, and Austria, provisional aid of $597 million is necessary. Marshall continued: After the emergency period, $1.5 billion will be needed from March 31 to the end of the fiscal year on June 30, and another $6 billion in the entire year beginning on July 1.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 10th Dispatch: Washington News, Marshall believes in his speech that the situation in Europe is serious, and the United States must quickly provide Europe with assistance. He said that economic assistance cannot guarantee "automatic success," but "I believe the hope of success is very great." Regarding the Soviet claim that the purpose of the Marshall Plan is to control Europe, Marshall strongly denied it, claiming that this plan has no evil intentions, and its purpose is to assist foreign production and construction, and does not threaten any country. He said that U.S. assistance should take the form of both grants and loans. Marshall officially revealed for the first time that the beneficiary countries should provide certain guarantees, that is, this assistance should be used to achieve economic recovery as quickly as possible. Efforts must be made to stabilize the economy, develop production (especially coal and food), and reduce trade barriers.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] The chairmen's meeting of the two House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees does not intend to ask Marshall questions today. After Marshall's report is completed, the two committees will hold individual meetings to determine the procedures for listening to opinions from all parties. This stage of work will take about a week. Cabinet members such as Under Secretary of State Lovett, Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, Secretary of the Treasury Snyder, and Secretary of Commerce Harriman will all attend the meeting to present their views. When the full Congress convenes on November 17, President Truman will personally attend to announce his plans for foreign aid and domestic inflation control. The U.S. government and experienced members of Congress expect that there will be no major opposition to the emergency aid plan in Congress. Although the amount of aid will be carefully considered, this transitional aid plan will definitely be passed before Christmas in any case. As for Marshall's long-term aid plan for Europe, in addition to possible discussions on the amount, there should be no obstacles.

### Democratic Leader Connally Advocates That Aid to Europe Should Not Establish Another Agency The State Department Should Directly Supervise and Implement

[United Press, Washington, 9th] Senator Foreign Affairs Committee Democratic Leader Connally announced today that the foreign aid bill should be directly supervised and implemented by the State Department. A supervisor should be appointed to submit reports to President Truman through the State Department. Connally's remarks represent the government's view, which contradicts the Republican Party's request to establish another agency to take charge of it.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] It is informally rumored here that two people may be appointed to the world's most important position, namely the general manager of the Marshall Plan. The most popular candidate is former Senator La Follette, who is the author of the report recommending the establishment of this position and other proposals related to the aid to Europe program. Another person who is considered possible and suitable for this position by relevant parties is the current Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Douglas.

### Harriman Report Good Response in Europe

[Reuters, London, 9th] After the publication of the Harriman Committee's report on the Marshall Plan, the reaction in Europe has been generally welcoming. The details are as follows: France: Government officials are generally favorable, but the Communist Party continues to criticize it; Denmark: Political circles expressed surprise at the reduction in the amount of aid, but felt that it was better than no aid at all; Italy: Left-wing newspapers paid little attention to the report, while other newspapers strongly promoted it; Netherlands: Finance Minister Lieftingk said: After the reduction in aid to Europe, if wages and prices are not strictly controlled, inflation in Europe will be unavoidable; Greece: Deputy Prime Minister Tsaldaris said: The sooner the Marshall Plan is implemented, the sooner Europe can obtain freedom and security; Czechoslovakia: The only newspaper to comment was the army newspaper "Lido Bao," which said that the report intends to rebuild German industry and blindly opposes communism.

### Thailand's Bloodless Coup Successful Aphaiwong Forms New Cabinet Will Promulgate New Constitution to Restore King's Power

[United Press, Bangkok, 10th] Aphaiwong, who served as Prime Minister twice in 1944 and 1946, has been appointed as the new Prime Minister of Thailand today. A Privy Council has been formed by former Regent Chana, former National Assembly member Sevi, and General Adul, Arongkorn and Lieutenant General Xie Yide, to preside over state affairs. King Bhumibol will return from Switzerland next month. The Privy Council has immediately promulgated a constitution to restore part of the power that was taken from the King in 1932. The new constitution was drafted by former Prime Minister and Ambassador to the United States, Pramoj. According to the new constitution, the parliament will continue to adopt a bicameral system, but the upper house members will be appointed by the King instead of being elected by the people. The new Prime Minister will announce the list of cabinet members.

### International Communist Information Bureau Will Hold First Meeting Next Month

[Reuters, Warsaw, 9th] According to authoritative sources: The Communist Information Bureau in Belgrade is scheduled to hold its first meeting in early December. The main items on the agenda will be the status of the French and Czech Communist Parties. International Communist leaders are clearly uneasy about the recent developments in these two countries. It is expected that the meeting may decide on the actions that the French Communist Party should take once de Gaulle seizes power. In addition, the participation of the Ukrainian Communist Party in the Information Bureau will be formally approved. The person in charge of the Communist Information Bureau is said to have been elected by the Yugoslavian Mi Fanova Dalaslei as the permanent secretary of the organization. The chairman of the first meeting will either be the leader of the Polish Communist Party, Władysław, or the new Romanian Foreign Minister, Ms. Paul. According to the draft charter of the organization, the position of chairman will be rotated monthly.

### Stalin Reiterates That the Soviet Union Does Not Want War Washington Believes That the Soviet Union Seems to Be Temporarily Unwilling to Communize All of Europe

[Reuters, Sydney, 9th] The Australian-Soviet Association published a report on the recent travels in Eastern Europe and meeting with Marshal Stalin by Jensen, the deputy bishop of Canterbury, England. It is said that Stalin told them that the Soviet Union fully understands the current international problems and is determined not to start a war. Stalin said: "The Soviet Union does not want war, but wants to maintain friendly relations with Western countries. The Soviet Union fully recognizes the difficulty of peacefully resolving various problems in peacetime, but the Soviet Union is still willing to seek peaceful solutions and believes that they will be obtained."

[United Press, Washington, 10th] In view of the recent intensification of the Eastern European countries' purge of anti-communist parties, diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet Union will temporarily shift its efforts to communize all of Europe and devote itself to strengthening the Communist Party's control over Nan, Bao, A, Czech, Bo, Hungary, and Romania. As for France and Italy, the Communist Party will only have the opportunity to seize power when there is a severe shortage of food and fuel this winter. However, even so, the Communist Party's control will inevitably be fragile, because the economic and political habits of Western and Eastern Europe are fundamentally different.

British Military Authorities in Germany Issue Secret Orders to Deal with the Situation Carefully

[United Press, Dusseldorf, Germany, 9th] It was learned today that the British occupying authorities have secretly ordered military government officials not to participate in the anti-communist movement in the U.S. occupied zone. The British believe that "attacking the Communist Party is indistinguishable from attacking the Soviet Union." The U.S. governor recently announced that the U.S. military will respond to the Communist Party's accusations with an active anti-communist movement, but the British side will maintain a passive attitude, at least until the end of the four-nation foreign ministers meeting in London in November.

### The United States Government and the Public Attach Importance to the Threat of Inflation

[United Press, Washington, 10th] President Truman admitted frankly that the threat of inflation greatly undermines the prosperity of the United States. This statement shows that the Congress will face a major economic task when it holds meetings on November 17 this year and January 3 next year. Although the emergency aid to Europe plan and the Marshall Plan are both of great global significance, the inflation debate is still the most important domestic issue, because the United States will hold a general election next year, so this matter is particularly important.

### US Opposes Dividing Germany; If the Four Foreign Ministers Conference Fails, Plans to Discuss Economic Agreements with Germany Separately

[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The Foreign Policy Association recently released a report by Paul Nitze, former administrative advisor to General Clay. In the report, Nitze warned that if the Four Foreign Ministers Conference results in Germany being divided into Soviet and Western zones, "we might as well dig trenches early to await the inevitable conflict."

[Associated Press, London, 9th] A spokesperson for the US delegation at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference announced today that the United States has a plan to sign a separate economic agreement with Germany if the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the German peace treaty fails. This plan has also been privately discussed with the United Kingdom.

### US Expresses Deep Concern Over the Situation in Greece

[Our Correspondent] New York, 10th, Broadcast: Washington, message.

Truman expressed deep concern that the internal factors of Greece's economic and political instability still remain.

### Conflicts Between Left and Right Factions in Italy

[United Press International, Rome, 9th] In four cities in northern Italy on the evening of the 9th, left-wing and right-wing elements exchanged fire with machine guns and grenades. Right-wing elements attacked the residences of "red elements," while left-wing elements accused fascists of being allowed to operate openly without police interference. Miraglia, a far-right member of the Italian Social Movement, was attacked by five unidentified thugs. Miraglia had attended a hearing opposing the trial of a Milan communist newspaper. A group of thugs near Miraglia attacked the residences of industrialists with machine guns and grenades. Shooting incidents also occurred in Novena and Monchai at the same time.

### Philippine General Election Today

[Central News Agency, Manila, 10th] Four million registered Philippine voters will participate in the country's first national election since independence tomorrow. Eight senators, 101 governors, 164 provincial councilors, 76 mayors, and thousands of municipal councilors will be elected. Both the Liberal Party (the ruling party) and the Nationalist Party (the minority party) are confident of victory on the eve of the election. The atmosphere of the national campaign is very tense, especially in some areas where party candidates are competing fiercely. Persecution, fraud, and violence arising from the election continue to occur.

### Split Within French Labor Union; General Confederation of Labor Leader Condemns Communist Manipulation of Union Affairs; Major Blow to the Strength of the French Communist Party

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] A highly noteworthy split has occurred in the French labor movement. Two hundred leaders of the Communist Party-controlled "General Confederation of Labor" (France's largest national labor union organization) issued a declaration today, denouncing the Communist Party's use of union organizations to achieve its political goals. At the same time, they expressed support for the Marshall Plan and declared their determination to take action to democratize the General Confederation of Labor.

Jouhaux, one of the two deputy secretaries-general of the General Confederation of Labor, is the leader of the anti-communist leaders in the labor union. He has just returned to Paris from New York. According to well-informed sources, Jouhaux felt uneasy about the General Confederation of Labor's excessive involvement in national political affairs, so he decided to take on a more active role in the French labor movement. After the French Communist Party became politically isolated, it relied solely on the General Confederation of Labor to maintain its power. Therefore, if the general workers can understand that opposing the Marshall Plan means rejecting improved industrial standards, the position of the Communist Party will inevitably be shaken.

[Reuters, London, 10th] The declaration issued by 200 minority leaders of the French General Confederation of Labor has aroused great interest here. This move not only introduces the Communist Party issue into a stage of open conflict, but also may overturn the balance between communist and non-communist elements in the World Federation of Trade Unions. In the past, if there were disputes within the union, they were all resolved by Jouhaux. Now that Jouhaux himself is leading the issuance of this declaration, it can be seen that the split is becoming more obvious and certain.

Japanese Mail to Our Country Must Not Use "Shina"; Otherwise, the Post Office Will Not Accept It

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The Ministry of Communications announced: All mail sent to the Northeast must indicate the Northeast of the Republic of China. If "Manchuria" is written, it will not be accepted. Letters that write "Shina" without writing the Republic of China will also not be accepted. This is just one of the efforts of the Japanese to eliminate the remnants of past imperialism in all aspects of life. However, the general public's mentality still fails to understand this. Even when members of the Japanese Diet give speeches, they often use the word "Shina." This action is not intentional but a phenomenon that the habits of militarism are difficult to change.

### Indian Army Takes Over Junagadh Administration

[Reuters, New Delhi, 9th] Authoritative sources: A battalion of the Indian Dominion Army, assisted by medium tanks, entered Junagadh City, the capital of Junagadh State on the east coast of the Indian Peninsula, tonight.

### Municipal Government to Hold Economic Inspection Meeting Today to Discuss Handling of Sealed and Hoarded Paper; Rice Merchants Summoned to Accept Police Bureau's Advice

[Our Correspondent] Recently, commodity prices in this city seem to be fluctuating again. A reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday. Wu said that the recent price problem is not yet serious. Because rice from the countryside is arriving on the market in the evening, rice prices have been very stable in recent days. Moreover, rice produced on both sides of the Yangtze River will soon arrive in Shanghai, so the current situation is still optimistic. For the sake of prevention, the municipal government has decided to hold an economic inspection meeting today to discuss the issue of seized and hoarded paper. Legitimate merchants will be allowed to unseal their goods. The previously proposed method of restricting paper storage to no more than three months would have too much impact on paper merchants and would be difficult to implement. Therefore, future work will focus on cracking down on hoarding by people outside the industry. Detailed measures will be discussed today.

[Another Report] The new Chief of the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, Cao Maoliang, summoned the heads of the North and South Rice Markets to the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday and gave them advice in person. Those who attended included Hu Wen'an, Zhang Yin'nan, and Qiu Fuxiang from the South Rice Market, and Xu Songren and Zha Bao'san from the North Rice Market. Chief Cao gave two pieces of advice: 1. Assist in preventing unreasonable increases in rice prices, and require the Rice Merchants Association to report daily details of the quantity of rice sold, the quantity of rice in storage, the source of rice, and prices at the place of production. 2. It is hoped that the Rice Merchants Association will strictly abide by: (A) If commodity prices have not risen, rice prices must not lead the price increase. (B) If rice prices at the place of production have not risen, rice prices in this city must not be arbitrarily raised. The rice merchants expressed their acceptance of Chief Cao's advice and will transfer the notification to industry members to comply.

Yesterday, the Economic Section of the Police Bureau cracked down on a secret organization engaged in the black market for gold and US dollars. This organization was located upstairs at 95 Lloyd Road. When the economic police pushed open the door according to the address, they saw two people busy answering the phone, and there were records similar to market quotations on the table. While the police were conducting the search, they ordered the personnel at the site to hand over the gold and US dollars. One of them, named Wang Cheng, took out four small bars of gold and 300 US dollars from a secret place. At the same time, a safe was found, as well as many other pieces of evidence. At this time, a person named Li Amao came to the site, and three large bars of gold were found on his body. Wang Cheng and Li Amao were taken to the bureau together. The person in charge of the site, Wen Zhiou, will also be summoned for questioning.

### Fundraising for Winter Relief is Not Easy; Charity Horse Racing is Extremely Difficult to Realize; Still Hoping for Assistance from Theaters; Let's See the Outcome of Today's Talk

[Our Correspondent] The weather has suddenly turned cold in recent days, and street vagrants are gradually being threatened by cold and hunger. In order to raise funds for winter relief in this city, the Municipal Council had a resolution to hold charity horse racing. A reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire about the preparations of the municipal government. According to Mayor Wu: The horse racing matter has not yet been settled. Because the municipal government has not yet consulted with the Jockey Club. The mayor expressed to the Jockey Club authorities that the venue has not been used for a long time and is quite damaged, and the municipal government must approve its continuous use for several years before it can be repaired at all, and it is considered absolutely impossible, because the government has already decided to buy the horse racing venue. However, the method of purchase has not yet been decided, either by issuing public bonds or by adopting land exchange methods, and it remains to be discussed at length. Moreover, the venue repairs require a certain amount of time, and whether there are problems with horse racing is also unknown. Therefore, whether horse racing can become a reality this winter is not yet known.

According to Mayor Wu, the winter relief funds for this city this year need at least 60 billion yuan, and fundraising will begin immediately. The previous Senate meeting had resolved to add 20% to the entertainment tax, but film producers and theater industry unanimously opposed it. The municipal government decided to convene representatives of film producers and those in charge of the theater industry association today to talk, hoping that they would serve the poor masses and accept it.

Fourteen Houses Must be Demolished

(Our Correspondent) Regarding the problem of widening and demolishing houses on Tianmu Road, according to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau yesterday: The widening project of this road is carried out in accordance with the resolution of the Senate. The northern 21 meters were completed as early as May of this year, and the southern 14-meter road boundary was also stipulated in the Public Works Bureau era before the war. Now, in order to sympathize with the people's difficulties, it has been decided to demolish 14 houses first before the 15th of this month, and the houses to be demolished in these 14 houses are only half of the original houses. After the demolition, the residents can still use the remaining half of the houses for business. All other houses are allowed to be demolished in two installments before the end of February and April 15 next year, so as to pass the Lunar New Year. The municipal government has allocated funds to the Civil Affairs Bureau for the relocation fees of all the residents of all the houses, which will be distributed by the district office. All of the above 14 houses that should have half of their houses demolished first are limited to be demolished before the 15th of this month. If they do not obey the order to demolish, the Public Works Bureau will have no choice but to send workers and police to demolish them on their behalf. It is deeply hoped that the residents of all the houses to be demolished on Tianmu Road should understand that this method will not affect their business during the New Year and that they can automatically demolish them within the time limit, so as to facilitate construction and benefit transportation.

Each District of the Municipality Produces One National Assembly Representative; The Legislative Yuan Believes There is No Legal Basis

The senates of the five municipalities directly under the central government, Shanghai, Qingdao, Shenyang, Hankou, and Chongqing, telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan on September 5, believing that the status of the municipalities directly under the central government is the same as that of a province, and that the valley areas under their jurisdiction are the same as a county in a province. Therefore, the production of National Assembly representatives in the municipalities directly under the central government is also requested to be approved in accordance with this ratio, so that each district produces one representative. After detailed discussion by the Constitutional Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, it was believed that "the production of National Assembly representatives, the Constitution takes counties and cities as units, and there is no distinction between municipalities directly under the central government and municipalities directly under the province. As for the equal district tools of the districts of municipalities directly under the central government and counties and cities, their nature is also different. The requested item seems to have no legal basis." This opinion was passed by the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 21st of last month. The National Government's Civil Service Department has notified the senates of each municipality directly under the central government to check.

### Midnight Robbery in Zhabei, Two People Shot and Injured; Double-Gun Gang Robs Rice Store

The representatives of the industrial circles who attended the meeting felt that it was of profound significance and worthy of permanent commemoration, so they presented a request to the government in the name of the general meeting to stipulate this day as the Industrial Festival.

### Having Practiced Tai Chi, He Has the Ability to Climb Walls: Xie Zhongmin Sentenced to Eight Years Imprisonment for Attempted Murder, Suspected of Having Other Motives for Sneaking into Neighbor's House

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xie Zhongmin, a young man from Nanjing living at No. 26, Lane 236, Xiamen Road, squandered his savings from his previous silk business on singing and dancing, and became unemployed. Shunned by relatives and friends, he suffered a great mental shock. On the afternoon of the 16th of last month, he bought a pair of handcuffs, a hemp rope, a bag of cotton, and a pair of scissors. At 3:00 AM the next day, he carried a pistol, along with the aforementioned items, and sneaked to the front door of the Liu family next door. He first cut the telephone line, tied it into a knot, and used it to climb to the second-floor window, intending to commit illegal acts. The Liu couple noticed this and screamed. Xie fired a shot and fled. He was later captured by police officers near the North Zhejiang Road Bridge and sent to court on charges of banditry. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court held its first hearing. The defendant confessed: I am from Nanjing, 24 years old. I returned home at 10:00 PM on October 16th and lay down on the sofa in the living room. After a while, my mother returned from playing mahjong with friends, went upstairs to sleep, and I went out. I lingered in front of the Liu's house and then returned, going in and out five or six times. At this point, Judge Shen Tianbao questioned Xie, "You went in and out five or six times, were you having a nervous breakdown?"

The audience burst into laughter.

Xie replied, "I wasn't having a nervous breakdown, it was because I was too nervous. My pistol was given to me by Yoshida Shigeru of Japan. I wasn't going to rob the Liu family, I was going to scare him because Mr. Liu often spoke ill of me." Next, Liu Zhu Shi, the complainant, described the circumstances of Xie firing the gun that night. Then, witness Zhang Wenzheng described how he apprehended Xie and how he forcefully seized the gun. Finally, Xie Zhongmin's aunt testified that Xie was her nephew, whom she had raised since he was a child. His conduct was usually good, and she didn't know this would happen. Judge Shen then asked Xie Zhongmin about his wall-climbing skills.

Where did you learn them?

Xie replied, "I didn't learn them anywhere, I just practiced Tai Chi when I was young." After the defendant's lawyer made a defense, the court immediately pronounced the verdict, "Xie Zhongmin is sentenced to eight years imprisonment for attempted murder, and the pistol is confiscated." Xie was quite calm after hearing the verdict and walked out of the courtroom with large strides. Reporters visited several of Xie's neighbors yesterday. They said that Xie Zhongmin was actually the biological son of Xie Zhang Shi, and the Xie family was quite wealthy, so Xie would never commit theft. They suspected he had other motives for sneaking into his neighbor's house.

[Report from Our Newspaper] After Li Zhen, the red dancer known as the "Foreign Girl," had her residence broken into and clothes and other items stolen on the afternoon of the 9th, believing that she could vaguely identify the robbers, she accompanied six plainclothes police officers from the Changning Police Sub-bureau to the Xinhua Dance Hall on Edward Road at 10:00 PM last night to investigate. The dance floor was filled with dancers. Suddenly, the lights came on and the music stopped, causing widespread panic. The police officers searched one by one but found nothing. As they were about to leave, more than a dozen people in uniform crowded out of the hall. Two people were assigned to monitor each plainclothes officer, who explained that they were carrying out a mission, but the situation was very tense, resulting in the loss of three guns from the plainclothes officers. The entire scene was in turmoil, with people rushing to escape, and the glass of the front door was broken. Fortunately, the police officers remained calm and reported the incident to the Taishan Police Sub-bureau for handling.

### Xinsheng Bookstore Sued for Disobedience

[Report from Our Newspaper] Although the "English-Chinese New Character Four-Use Dictionary" of Xinsheng Bookstore is in the midst of a dispute, it is still being published, and all those who pre-ordered it have already received their books. They have also declared in response to Jingwen Bookstore's lawsuit accusing them of copying the "English New Character Dictionary" and infringing on copyright that the three demands made by Jingwen are unacceptable, and they will demand that Jingwen withdraw the original case and decide to appeal. When Jingwen presented evidence of copied sample pages, Xinsheng had not yet published its book, and those sample pages are suspected of being stolen.

### Relying Entirely on Touch to Understand the World: The School for the Blind Conscientiously Trains Children Deprived of Sight

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] According to a relatively reliable statistic, there are more than five million blind people in China today, but there are only more than fifty schools for training and educating the blind. Assuming that each school accommodates three hundred people, less than ten thousand people are being trained. The remaining millions who are forever separated from the light passively accept their tragic fate, allowing pale imagination to devour their unspoken lives.

Blind people are no less capable than sighted people in making contributions later in life. Song Guanlin, secretary to the outstanding Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Peixin, editor of the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, and Wu Guobiao, director of the National Association for the Blind, are all people who were deprived of their visual acuity by the Creator. However, after ten years of training at the school for the blind, they eventually made their way to St. John's University. Wu Guobiao even stayed in the United States for two years after graduating from St. John's, earning a degree from Columbia University before returning. Their achievements are worthy of admiration.

The achievements of the school for the blind in this area are worthy of admiration. Looking at the facilities within the school, one is even more amazed at their care and perseverance. On a flat road, there is an uneven slope every so often, marking that there is a crossroad ahead. All kinds of physical models have been designed to enable blind students to understand the true nature of the world through touch. Don't think this is a simple matter; there is no common sensory experience between the teacher and the student. It is entirely through these gropings and collisions that they construct a rudimentary universe in their consciousness that they have never experienced before.

### Intelligence Is Not Inferior

At the school for the blind, the reporter saw a nine-year-old student named Shi Mingde, who is the only student in the school with a relatively wealthy family. According to him, the world is too unfamiliar to him, and he has no memory of his parents' appearance. Memory is entirely equal to a blank sheet of paper, but the only thing he can deduce is that fluorescent lights (daylight lamps) are brighter than electric lights. Another girl said: She spends more than ten hours a day knitting yarn, and her mind is filled with the marks of squares and patterns interwoven by long and short needles. Therefore, she seems to have the illusion that the world's space is also filled with squares and patterns. In addition, a 23-year-old blind student told the reporter: The accumulation of more than 20 years of life experience has cultivated in him the habit of doing everything slowly. Whether eating, walking, or urinating, he tries to do it as slowly as possible, because he believes that only slow movements can ensure that his goals are achieved smoothly.

I hope everyone will not look down on those blind people who have not received training and educational opportunities! Their intelligence is not inferior. The problem is that the Creator and society have let them down!

### A Riot Erupts in Shanghai Prison Over Yang Anren's Rice Porridge; Disturbance Calms Down, Warden Requests Punishment

[Report from Our Newspaper] To understand the truth behind the riot in Shanghai Prison over Yang Anren's rice porridge, a reporter visited Shanghai Prison authorities yesterday and interviewed Yang Anren and Zhan Sheng, the main figures in the Jin Chao case, for half an hour. Yang's hair was short and disheveled, with a full beard, wearing a prison cloth short shirt and trousers, and black cloth shoes. Regarding the riot, he said it was caused by the rice porridge, and that prisoner No. 202 and others used this as an excuse to demand compensation of two bottles of milk per person, totaling thousands of bottles for 4,000 people. However, Yang claimed that he did not pay any money. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, some prisoners had threatened to extort money, but Yang ignored them. He felt that it was unbearable to have intellectual criminals and third-rate gangsters imprisoned in the same place and hoped that there would be some reform.

Visiting Zhan Sheng at the prison hospital, Zhan wore a velvet hat and a black jacket, and had blue silk leggings. He was helped downstairs by someone. He said that he had been in the hospital for more than ten days due to high blood pressure, and was still receiving injections and medication. He had also eaten rice porridge in the past, exchanging his own staple food, sauces, and pickles for it. The riot occurred three days after he entered the hospital, so he did not know the details and did not pay any money. When he entered the prison, other prisoners had intended to insult him and extort money, but he endured and did not resist.

Report and Handling Process

The riot in Shanghai Prison was quelled by the suppression of Guard Section Chief Ding Baocheng. Ninety-one prisoners who usually had bad character and liked to cause trouble were concentrated in the "He Prison" for strict supervision and to promote self-reflection. It is reported that Prison Warden Kong Xianglin will return to Shanghai today. Guard Section Chief Ding has prepared a report on the handling of the incident and has requested punishment. The original text is roughly as follows: "The kitchen workers had an altercation due to personal grudges. There were many workers serving in the kitchen, and this department did not hire boiler technicians. The replenishment of lunch boxes was not timely, and the order of meals was inevitably somewhat chaotic. At this time, the old and new administrations are transitioning, personnel are incomplete, and arrangements are not yet finalized, so all management cannot take decisive action. This difficult situation has long been observed by the leader.

The Cause

Yesterday (the 3rd), prisoner No. 180 and others expressed dissatisfaction with the behavior of prisoner No. 202, 419, and 651 (namely Shi Liangen, Zhou Xinglong, and Xu Zaichang) in the same workshop and requested the section chief to isolate them. Dozens of prisoners jointly requested this, and No. 202 and others also pointed out that the other party was forming cliques and excluding dissidents. Considering that the dispute was purely due to emotional conflict, I instructed them to submit evidence for verification and immediately ordered the isolation and detention of No. 202 and others because they had angered the public. Today (the 4th), I feared a conflict between the two parties and personally led the standby team to the kitchen to supervise the distribution of food and water and urged both parties to submit evidence to the section as soon as possible. According to guard chief Wang Xinzhun and Education Section Chief Jian Xiu, there were behind-the-scenes figures in this dispute, and they were clearing up the clues and conducting reconciliation.

At the Same Time

I realized that the prisoners on both sides were desperate outlaws, and the kitchen tools could be used as weapons at any time. I urgently locked the iron doors of the workshops in each cell at noon, collected the keys, added weapons to each guard, and summoned the standby guards outside to await dispatch. According to a secret report from guard chief Wang Xin, each side had nearly a thousand people assisting them. Regardless of whether this was true, it was necessary to take strict precautions. At 2:00 PM, Section Chief Wang and guard chief Wang were urging the two main parties to come to a result in reconciliation when No. 180 and others sent representatives to the section to make further demands, insisting that the prison authorities immediately transfer No. 202 and others away. The three prisoners under attack by the public, No. 202 and others, insisted that even if they were allowed to enter the kitchen again, they had to stay in the workshop for several days to save face. I silently observed that the two sides could not coordinate and ordered each to return to their original positions and ordered No. 180 and others to resume work as usual as soon as possible.

Meal Distribution

It was already after 3:00 PM. No. 202 and others encountered a kitchen worker delivering water on their way back to their cells and made rude remarks, resulting in a dispute with kitchen worker No. 3147 (namely Zhou Wenlong). At that time, in the inner prison courtyard facing the warden's office to the north, I suddenly saw prisoners pouring out of the kitchen, more than a dozen wielding weapons and more than a dozen unarmed. I immediately ordered them to put down their weapons and ordered the standby team to fire shots into the air as a warning. The prisoners were subdued and retreated. With the consent of the main department dispatched by the Shanghai High Court, this prison telegraphed the Shanghai District Court Detention Center and temporarily detained the three prisoners No. 202, 419, and 651. At the same time, the kitchen workers were ordered to resume work as usual and distribute the meals. Fortunately, the other prisoners were alerted early and there was no spread of the disturbance. This was the end of the incident."

### District Procuratorate Brings Main Culprits of Disturbance to Trial

[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Procuratorate is scheduled to bring the main culprits of the Shanghai Prison disturbance, Shi Liangen, Zhou Xinglong, and Xu Zaichang, to trial this afternoon (currently detained at the Sinan Road Detention Center). Shi and others are being sued by another prisoner, Zhou Wenlong, on charges of "attempted murder." Shanghai Prison inmates Lu Jinshan, No. 1737, and Chun J, No. 3208, will be summoned to court as witnesses. According to people in the court, prisoners suing each other is a rare sight. This is a completely new type of lawsuit case.

### Central Bank Money Boxes Fall From the Sky; Miao People Make a Fortune; Xiang Province Exchanges Them at 20% Discount; Total Value of 48 Billion Yuan

[Hengyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 10th] The Central Bank of Chongqing previously entrusted the Air Transport Brigade to transport sixty boxes of 10,000-yuan banknotes to Chongqing on August 25th. Over the skies of Qian and Gui, due to mechanical failure, the money boxes were forced to be dropped in the Miao areas of Huangping and Shibing. The Qian Province government investigated and found their whereabouts at that time. Now, the new banknotes have all been picked up by the Miao people, with a total value of 48 billion yuan.

The Miao people initially did not recognize their value. Later, they took a bundle, worth 10 million yuan, to buy meat at a butcher shop. The butcher shop was greatly surprised. The Miao people were overjoyed and moved en masse to the towns to spend the money. Some bought and used them at a discount. Now they have spread throughout Hunan and Guizhou. Because of these lost banknotes, the Central Bank in Shaoyang has refused to accept them, causing the citizens to feel uneasy.

It is learned that the Central Bank branches in Hunan have received telegrams to exchange them at a 20% discount, and the serial numbers of the banknotes have been announced as new banknotes from 50 to 50.

### Wenling Rice Prices Increase Three or Four Times a Day

[Wenling Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 7th] Rice prices have been soaring in recent days. Early rice has risen to 850,000 yuan per picul, late rice has risen to 900,000 yuan, and glutinous rice has risen to 1.2 million yuan. The supply is limited, and prices are still rising. This is the result of smuggling out to sea. All parties hope that the authorities will take strict precautions. In addition, merchants from neighboring counties such as Wanghuan and Chumen are greedy for high profits, raising market prices and buying up rice in this city to transport it out of the country to Da and Xiaoqing, often making several times the profit. Therefore, rice prices increase three or four times a day, and people are quite alarmed. If this continues, the rice supply will be depleted, and people's food security will be at risk.

### Pingyang Experiencing Rice Shortage

[Pingyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 8th] Pingyang, traditionally known as a land of fish and rice, has recently been experiencing a major rice shortage, with grain prices higher than in other counties. Common people rely on rice vendors from various villages to transport and sell rice in the city. Once rice prices fluctuate, not a single grain can be seen. Mills in coastal areas such as Wanquan and Jiangnan have been milling rice secretly at night, with unscrupulous merchants lurking in the shadows, smuggling it out to sea. It has recently been learned that the local land and grain authorities have received reports that bandits are purchasing grain at high prices. They have issued a public notice and have sent police officers to the countryside to strictly investigate and prohibit this.

### Xikou to Establish Hydroelectric Plant; Ministry of Water Resources Approves Allocation of 200 Million Yuan for Materials

[Hangzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 9th] The Water Conservancy Demonstration Engineering Office of the Ministry of Water Resources previously sent the 291st Survey Team to survey the area around Xuebao Temple and Yintan in Xikou to design a hydroelectric plant. It is learned that this project has been surveyed and designed and is planned to build a dike in front of Xuebao Temple to create a reservoir. The original waterfall at Qianzhangyan will be preserved and controlled. Another channel will be controlled on the ridge of Dagongling Mountain to set up a hydroelectric plant. It is estimated that it can generate 1,000 horsepower, which can supply electricity to Ningbo. Once the ministry approves, construction can begin. It is said that the Ministry of Water Resources has agreed to allocate 200 million yuan for the required materials.

### Explanation of Method for Exempting Native Cloth from Business Tax

[Jiangyin Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 6th] The local cloth industry association in this county submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for exemption from business tax. Later, because the scope of the exemption differed from the ministry's approval, the provincial government issued an explanation that farmers who weave native cloth themselves and sell it directly to distributors should be exempt from business tax in accordance with the regulations on the native cloth manufacturing industry. If the above-mentioned native cloth is purchased and resold by cloth merchants, the cloth merchant's part is within the scope of the trading industry and should be taxed in accordance with the law. This does not conflict with the Ministry of Finance's regulations that all native cloth manufacturing industries, whether spun and woven by hand or woven in factories, are exempt from business tax, except for distributors. As for the association's submission that distributors who set up factories to recruit workers to weave and sell directly, the part they manufacture themselves should be exempt from business tax, and the part they sell from other factories should still be taxed in accordance with the regulations. In addition, if distributors provide looms to farmers to weave, and the distributors also provide cotton yarn and collect the native cloth, and the farmers only receive wages, then the distributors should be exempt from business tax because they are hiring but not weaving themselves. Otherwise, they should still be taxed in accordance with the regulations.

### Jiangnan Youth Enlist in the Army; Division Headquarters Orders Deferment

[Zhenjiang Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 9th] The Southern Jiangsu Division Headquarters previously launched a youth enlistment campaign and allocated a total of 3,000 volunteers to the counties in Jiangnan. The headquarters has now telegraphed the counties under its jurisdiction to exempt this quota from reallocation. The original telegram stated: "The pre-determined performance value of the youth enlistment quota previously issued by this headquarters will be used as a reference for this enlistment campaign until the end of this year's conscription period before being approved by the Ministry of National Defense and the provincial government. There will be no prior reallocation. As for counties where the conscription quota has been fully filled and there is no name to offset the conscription quota, in addition to actively promoting the enlistment campaign and preparing, the matters such as recruiting people and operating camps should await further instructions."

### General Relief Administration Zhejiang Branch Makes Last Gesture; Remaining 67 Bundles of Old Clothes Allocated to Zhejiang Provincial Journalists Association

The General Relief Administration's Zhejiang branch is making a last gesture, specially allocating the remaining 67 bundles of relief old clothes distributed by the branch to the Zhejiang Provincial Journalists Association. Unfortunately, with more than 4,000 members throughout the province, there are only 2,000 pieces of old clothing, so there is not enough to go around, making distribution difficult.

The price of a life has already been fixed. A few days ago, at the entrance of Dongqing Alley, a thug kicked a coolie to death. The murderer is willing to subsidize the deceased's family with 4.5 million yuan in an attempt to settle the matter privately.

The fare per stop on city buses has increased from 600 yuan to 1,000 yuan. The reason given is "trouble with making change."

Jiang Qian Naming Bridge has suffered two major fires in succession, leaving thousands of disaster victims homeless. Provincial and municipal authorities, as well as enthusiastic gentry, have held emergency relief efforts, but they are a drop in the bucket and do not help.

Hangzhou has not yet implemented food conservation. The major restaurants are always full, and business is booming.

Various cinemas are launching their autumn lineups. "Golden Stone Covenant" and "Silver River Serenade" are being released one after another, selling very well. (Ding)

### Boatman Shot and Killed for Disobeying Orders; Sentry Detained and Investigated According to Law

[Suzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 10th] This evening, a boat was traveling from Changshu to Suzhou. When it passed the joint military, police, and gendarmerie traffic safety inspection station near Yangguan, the sentry at the station ordered it to dock for inspection. Because the civilian boat had not obtained a pass, it intended to evade inspection and looked flustered, disobeying orders. The sentry accidentally fired his gun, and the boatman Mao Kunlin was accidentally injured by the stray bullet. He died due to excessive blood loss despite rescue efforts. Commander Peng was deeply saddened upon hearing the news. In addition to detaining the sentry and investigating him according to the law, he has also collected funds to comfort the deceased's family.

### Lanzhou Baiyi Nunnery: Dispute over Rent Leads to Nun's Suicide Attempt

[Our Lanzhou dispatch of the 5th] A nun in Lanzhou City's Yimin Road Baiyi Nunnery, named Hengyi, over forty years old, lives with her five disciples. They rely on the rent from the nunnery's sixty-odd rooms for their livelihood. Last spring, a man claiming to be Wang Zhongying, the principal of Lanzhou Mountain Middle School, declared that the nunnery's property had been allocated to establish the Lanzhou Mountain Middle School by order of the provincial government. He then evicted all the residents renting rooms in the nunnery, occupying over forty-one rooms. At that time, Hengyi, the head of the nunnery, sued Wang in the Gaolan District Court. After mediation by the court, a lease agreement was signed in June under Wang Zhongying's name, with a monthly rent of 20,000 yuan for the forty-one rooms. Later, due to rising prices, Hengyi repeatedly pleaded with Principal Wang to increase the rent, which was only increased to 60,000 yuan this spring.

This summer, Wang Zhongying, under the pretext of expanding the school buildings, further seized the remaining twenty-two rooms of the nunnery, and stopped paying the meager 60,000 yuan monthly rent in July this year. (Reporter's Note: Currently, the monthly rent for each room in Lanzhou is 100,000 yuan, and it is several times higher for shops along the street.)

The abbess of the nunnery, Hengyi, found herself destitute and her livelihood in dire straits. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, at 2:00 PM, she went to Wang's residence to demand the rent. Wang not only refused to pay but also threatened her and ordered Hengyi to vacate the three rooms where she and her five disciples were barely sheltering. Hengyi, unable to resist his menacing demeanor and finding her life in a desperate situation, saw a paper-cutting knife on Wang's desk and contemplated suicide. She grasped the knife and stabbed herself in the throat, causing a wound about three fen deep and two cun three fen long. She immediately fainted, with blood gushing out.

Her neighbors carried her to the Lanzhou City Health Office for treatment. Because the nun had no money for hospitalization, her disciples carried her back to the nunnery. Her life is currently not in danger, but she remains unconscious, and her livelihood is precarious, eliciting sympathy from all sides. It is reported that the Lanzhou District Court is investigating the case closely.

This morning, the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office specially summoned the rebel Shen to court. After Prosecutor Li Youren questioned him about the dates of holding and leaving his puppet positions, he was immediately returned to prison.

### Sino-American Educational Foundation Formally Signed Agreement Yesterday; Enhances Cultural Friendship Between China and the United States

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 10th] The signing ceremony of the Sino-American Educational Foundation Agreement was held at 4:30 PM yesterday in the Foreign Ministry auditorium. The American side was represented by Ambassador Stuart and Director Clark, while the Chinese side was represented by Foreign Minister Wang, Director Ling Qihan, Director Hu Qingqing, Director Lin, Deputy Director Wang Xiaoxi, and Deputy Director Chen Shicai. Ambassador Stuart and Foreign Minister Wang signed the agreement, took a commemorative photo, and announced the completion of the ceremony.

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 10th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on the 10th: "Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Shijie, representing the Government of the Republic of China, and American Ambassador to China, Dr. Stuart, representing the Government of the United States, signed an agreement at 4:30 PM today to establish the 'Sino-American Educational Foundation.' This agreement will provide the American government with 20 million US dollars in Chinese currency, to be used for certain cultural and educational purposes at a rate of one million US dollars per year. This is the first agreement the United States has signed with another country in accordance with the terms of the 1944 amendment to the American Surplus Property Act. In view of the long and successful record of Sino-American cultural cooperation, which has effectively enhanced the friendly relations between the two countries, and the mutual interest of the Chinese and American people in seeking peace and friendship, this first concluded agreement is of particular significance for continuing to strengthen this relationship.

[United States Information Service, Nanjing, 10th] The United States and China today agreed on the first international educational exchange program under the Fulbright Act. The two sides agreed to establish an American Education Foundation in China to manage some of the funds obtained from the sale of surplus goods to China. The agreement was concluded at 4:30 PM this afternoon, with Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Ambassador Stuart signing on behalf of the two countries. The Fulbright Act recognizes that many countries are unable to fully purchase these goods with US dollars, so it stipulates that a portion of the payments can be made in local currency, which the United States will then use for educational purposes.

### Six District Cotton Textile Association Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation Issue, Textile Federation Subcommittee Presents Eight Concrete Suggestions

[Our Dispatch] The Six District Cotton Textile Association held an emergency general meeting of members at 2:00 PM yesterday to address the issue of joint cotton yarn allocation. Over a hundred representatives attended. Rong Erren, representative of the Textile Federation attending the National Economic Commission in Nanjing, first reported on the situation. Then, the chairman presented the Ministry of Economic Affairs' draft plan for joint cotton yarn sales, immediately raising tensions across the room. All agreed that since the authorities still did not consider the difficulties raised by privately-owned yarn mills, it would be impossible to proceed. The Textile Federation Subcommittee's opinions are recorded below:

Under the guidance and supervision of the Textile Adjustment Committee, the Six District Cotton Textile Association will establish a Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation Committee to handle cotton yarn allocation matters. The specific measures will be determined separately. The cotton yarn controlled by the Allocation Committee will include all production from private member factories of the Six District Association in Shanghai, as well as cotton yarn spun on behalf of all private member factories of the Six District Association, for joint allocation. The price of cotton yarn allocation should be absolutely reasonable. The Allocation Committee should ensure the cost of reproduction, using a fixed formula with physical goods as the calculation basis, and determine it at any time. However, the profit should not exceed 15% in principle. If various factories participate in the allocation, and their working capital cannot be adjusted in time, the government is responsible for approving loans sufficient to cover the turnover of funds. The government should allow various factories to purchase national cotton, relax the amount of exchange margin allowed, and extend the exchange margin period to achieve the purpose of enriching raw cotton. The government should allow various factories to transport and sell 20% of their total production overseas, to exchange for foreign cotton and industrial raw materials, etc., and receive the same treatment as state-owned yarn mills. After the Allocation Committee is established, it should first handle the investigation, registration, and approval of cotton yarn allocation targets. As soon as it is completed, it will be implemented. The allocation method will be tentatively limited to six months.

Miscellaneous stocks, on the other hand, showed mixed performance. At the beginning of the session, due to reports of a US loan of 1 billion and Xu Cai's remarks on the reduction of deposit certificate fees, which indicated that it had not been mentioned, the current delivery price retreated to 297 yuan after opening at 303 yuan.

### Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Adjusted Again: 20-Count Yarn Increased by Over 1 Million Yuan

(Our Dispatch) The Textile Adjustment Committee's Negotiated Price Subcommittee decided yesterday to slightly adjust the negotiated price of 20-count cotton yarn, increasing it to 21 million yuan per piece, an increase of 1.15 million yuan compared to the previous time. The prices of other yarn counts will be adjusted in proportion.

Fine Yarn Declines

In yesterday's cotton yarn market, although the opening of the negotiated price by the Textile Adjustment Committee was higher, the market sentiment was weak due to unfavorable environmental factors, and many bulls turned to sell, causing the market to decline instead. Near the close, dye weaving factories and buyers from other places absorbed the price declines, and the market rebounded again. In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 300,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 36.2 million yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix also fell by 300,000 yuan, while other coarse yarns such as 32-count and 20-count rose by 150,000 to 350,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth Turns Upward

In the cotton cloth market, prices were low at the opening due to the eagerness to sell off accumulated positions from the previous day, but after 10 o'clock, buyers from Changsha, Hankou, Fujian, and other places absorbed Yuanzhi Gongni, and local dye factories bought mid-range fine cloth, causing the market to turn upward. As a result, fine cloths of various grades, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, continued to rise by 4,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to Saturday, Sijunzi Gongni rose sharply by 55,000 yuan, and the prices of other cloth remnants were also quite firm.

Raw Cotton Continues to Rise

Yesterday's raw cotton market continued to be firm. Buyers from other ports actively added to their positions, and local traders also increased their holdings. Prices were still slightly higher than on Saturday by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Transactions amounted to around 1,400 bales of various grades. Factory delivery prices were 4 million yuan for Kaiping, 3.75 million yuan for Chongchuan, and warehouse delivery prices were 3.96 million yuan for Kaiping, 3.596 million yuan for Hanxi, 3.7 million yuan for Shashi, 3.1 million yuan for Fude, 2.645 million yuan for Yaohua, 2.9 million yuan for Fire Machine, and 670,000 yuan for Zhouji Hua.

Procedures for Shipping Yarn and Cloth to South China Changed

The Textile Adjustment Committee urgently needs to process applications for shipping yarn and cloth to South China this month. The process starts on the 11th. The total amount of yarn and cloth approved for shipment to South China, combined with the remaining amount from last month, is approximately 5,000 pieces of yarn and over 140,000 zhang of cloth. To prevent applicants from overreporting and under-shipping, or transferring their allocations, the committee has slightly improved the application procedures for this month. Previously, the applicant would directly fill out the form, stamp it, and apply. Now, the applicant must obtain a blank application form, fill it out, and submit the application to the producing factory for stamping. The stamping factory will then submit the applicant's application to the Textile Adjustment Committee on their behalf. This will eliminate the problems with traders.

### International Market Has Many Obstacles: Export Trade Is Difficult to Develop: Domestic Goods Manufacturers Should Implement Joint Promotion

(Our Dispatch) Our country's recent export trade has entered a downturn again. In addition to the reason that the listed exchange rate and the black market rate cannot be consistent, there are still inherent difficulties in each sales market. Taking the United States as an example, raw silk was originally an important export, but recently, the United States imported a large amount of Japanese silk, and the stock piled up, the demand decreased, and the market price fell, affecting the sales of Chinese silk. Due to international competition, not much Chinese tea is exported. The sales of pig bristles are still good, mainly due to the lack of competition, and the quality of the substitute nylon is still not comparable to that of natural bristles. However, it has recently been reported that Germany has invented a machine for sorting pig bristles. If this is true, it will be a major blow to us. In Europe, the United Kingdom is a larger customer, and its need for food is very urgent. Our country cannot supply general grains. Only the Central Trust Bureau trades with the British Ministry of Food, exporting a large number of eggs. Recently, several egg factories in our city intend to export eggs and their products to the United Kingdom. The Industrial and Commercial Export Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has introduced them to the distribution officials of the British Ministry of Food to establish close contact, so as to clarify the types they need and be able to prepare in advance. As for the European continent, the outlook is not good, because after the great war, the wounds have not healed, the purchasing power is very low, and the main countries still maintain the wartime rationing system, so the quantity of foreign goods needed is not large. India and Southeast Asia are promising markets, but it is also premised on domestic goods manufacturers being able to abandon individual competition and implement joint promotion. Currently, there is a good trend in this direction.

### Sino-British Cooperation to Prevent Smuggling: Ships Sailing from Hong Kong to Chinese Ports Must Submit a Hatch List Verified by the Hong Kong Government

Hong Kong Shipping News: Our customs authorities are now taking stricter measures to prevent smuggling. From the 15th of this month, ships sailing from Hong Kong to ports in our country shall, upon arrival, submit to the local customs a copy of the hatch list of the goods loaded in Hong Kong to that place. The hatch list should first be certified by the Hong Kong government before it becomes effective. Any goods not included in the hatch list will be treated as smuggled goods. This measure has now been cooperated with by the Sino-British authorities to eliminate smuggling. The Hong Kong Government Information Office stated that the Chinese government had difficulty with the hatch list for goods imported into China from Hong Kong and believed that some goods sent to various ports in China from Hong Kong with a Hong Kong hatch list were unloaded midway and smuggled into China. As a result, the hatch list submitted when the ship arrived at a Chinese port was not consistent with the hatch list compiled and submitted to the Hong Kong government. The Chinese government has now invited the Hong Kong authorities to cooperate in finding ways to prevent such behavior. Therefore, from November 15, each ship arriving at a Chinese port carrying goods unloaded from Hong Kong must have a hatch list stamped by the responsible authority of the Hong Kong government and submit it to the local Chinese customs for inspection. To comply with the above regulations of the Chinese customs, shippers can obtain a departure certificate from the Hong Kong Marine Department and submit it together with the hatch list of goods unloaded from Hong Kong. If there are no goods unloaded from Hong Kong, a hatch list of "no goods unloaded from Hong Kong" must also be submitted. The hatch list should be in duplicate, and the Marine Department will stamp it when issuing the departure certificate. One copy will be returned to the shipper or its agent. The second copy will be sent to Hong Kong Customs. This second hatch list can be used as the hatch list deposited with Hong Kong Customs in accordance with Article 15 of the Import and Export Goods Registration Regulations of 1922. This method facilitates the loading and unloading of goods by shippers until they are ready to depart and avoids running between the two government agencies. One is to obtain the departure certificate, and the other is to submit a copy of the hatch list. The above method refers to ships traveling from Hong Kong to Chinese ports, carrying goods unloaded from Hong Kong, and carrying them to Chinese ports. Goods carried on the same ship from other places to China, passing through Hong Kong, or returning to Hong Kong for unloading and transporting to a certain port outside of China, are not subject to this rule.

### Rayon Slightly Firm

The rayon market was slightly firm yesterday. There were immediate transactions for 120-count Asahi brand 1A bright rayon at 86.5 million yuan in the morning. Later, due to the distribution by the Central Trust Bureau, a new inspection was required, and it was said that there may be a temporary suspension this week, so the market sentiment was relatively firm in the afternoon. There were transactions among traders at 77.5 million yuan, and finally someone wanted it at 80 million yuan. As a result, it was 2 million yuan higher than the weekend.

### Deadline for Registration of Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Extended to November 18

(Our Dispatch) The Import and Export Management Committee has announced that the deadline for completing the retroactive registration of types of goods with self-provided foreign exchange and no permits has been extended to November 18.

### "Pre-Announcement" Permits Allowed to be Extended to the End of This Year

[Our Dispatch] The Import and Export Management Committee issued a public notice yesterday stipulating that for various types of goods listed in Appendices A and B, the validity period of the "pre-announcement" import permits that have been issued, if the validity period is not specified, shall be uniformly extended to December 31 of this year. For "pre-announcement" import permits listed in Appendix A (B), the validity period shall uniformly expire on July 31 of this year. If the import declarations for all of the above-mentioned types of goods have been completed within the specified validity period, the "pre-announcement" import permits shall be invalid. Regarding the matters related to the above-mentioned "pre-announcement" import permits, as well as the application for replacing "pre-announcement" import permits for Appendix A type goods with "post-announcement" import permits, inquiries should be made to the Non-Quota Import Review Department of the Import and Export Management Committee.

### Export Management Committee Encourages Export Goods: Special Import Permit for Packaging Materials

[Our Dispatch] In order to encourage exports, the Export and Import Management Committee has specially permitted the import of packaging materials needed for shipping export goods, and has notified exporters to register at Room 321, 3rd Floor, China Bank Building, Renji Road, from the 12th to the 27th of this month for review. At the same time, it announced the "Methods for Special Permits for the Import of Packaging Materials Needed by Exporters for Shipping Export Goods":

Exporters may, for the packaging materials needed for their export business, import them with a special import permit outside the quota for these goods. However, exporters who have already received this preferential treatment shall not be entitled to this special permit again within the normal import quota for packaging materials. The import permit shall be issued by the Export and Import Management Committee.

If exporters wish to enjoy this preferential treatment, they should apply to the Export Promotion Department of the Export and Import Management Committee. The application shall include the following items: A. Detailed list of imported packaging materials; B. Estimated quantity and value of the materials needed, and the goods and quantities to be packaged; C. The port where the materials will be used.

The Export Promotion Department shall, before issuing this special import permit, carefully examine the exporter's application in accordance with the listed items. It must also be ascertained that the total quantity of all materials specially permitted for import does not exceed the proper total amount needed by China for the whole year. If the Export Promotion Department believes, when examining any application, that the quantity requested exceeds the actual need, it may make appropriate reductions.

Exporters shall provide a guarantee that they will not sell the materials imported with this special permit in the market without the written approval of the Export Promotion Department. Exporters who have imported packaging materials under the preferential treatment shall submit a statement to the Export Promotion Department at the end of every three months. The statement shall detail the quantity of materials used to package export goods. If the exporter's inventory exceeds the amount needed for future exports, the Export Promotion Department may, according to its regulations, transfer and sell the remaining portion to an exporter who needs these materials.

The Export Promotion Department shall have the right to audit the statements submitted by exporters.

In view of the importance of the economic handling and transportation of cotton to various industrial areas in China, the foregoing measures shall also apply to the packaging of cotton for domestic sales.

Special Edition Celebrating the First Industry Festival

### Celebrating the First Industrial Festival

— Wu Yun Chu

If a nation possesses fertile land, yet its people lack sufficient food, it is because plowing tools are scarce and incomplete, preventing the exchange of labor between morning and evening, thus hindering the hope of a bountiful harvest. If a land possesses abundant resources, yet its people lack sufficient wealth, it is because the quantity of [resources] has not been unlocked, causing idle investigations to permeate markets, obscuring the benefits of development. If markets have stagnant goods, yet the people lack sufficient materials for use, it is because transportation equipment is inadequate, preventing abundant goods from being mutually exchanged, hindering the effectiveness of equitable distribution. From this, it can be seen that when industry prospers, agriculture increases its yield, commerce increases its profit, the people become wealthy internally, and the nation becomes strong externally. Therefore, the waxing and waning of industry are proportional to the strength of the nation, and the poverty and wealth of the people are closely linked. From this, we know that the wealth and strength of others are not accidental, and our poverty and weakness are not coincidental. It is worthy of our deep and prolonged reflection. If we do not plan to build industry to aid development, allowing the land to fully realize its potential, yet seek the wealth and expansion of the nation, and the abundance of the people, what is the use of [expecting] granaries to alleviate hunger, [expecting to] gorge oneself behind closed doors, of facing carved tigers and dragons, inviting wind and summoning rain, and expecting wind and clouds to bring [benefits]? If we merely rely on imported goods for supplementation, without considering the outflow of profits, which is the main cause of the weakness of the nation and the poverty of the people, can we take from external treasuries endlessly to supply extravagant consumption? If rivers cannot [flow] continuously, and mountains and seas cannot look to streams, ancient teachings provide ample warning. Moreover, the consumption is far greater than leakage, and the expected benefits are even more different than small streams! Now, Heaven has not yet tired of chaos, and the nation is still engaged in war. The signal fires are ever more urgent, and there is no hope for development. Production frequently shrinks, and factories face the danger of collapse. What the heart perceives as danger, how can we remain silent? Therefore, at this time of joyful celebration, I once again voice urgent appeals, so that people in society can jointly recognize the importance of industrial construction, rise up together to support it, guide idle capital, bring it onto the right track for the benefit of the people, increase production, provide sufficient goods to build the foundation of the nation. Otherwise, even if we know that fertile soil is suitable for good fields, and straight trees are suitable for beams and pillars, if we do not cultivate them to sow good crops, or fell them to construct beams, how can we solve the lack of grain, or alleviate [poor] housing? All of us engaged in industry should strive diligently from dawn to dusk, not failing the expectations of the government above, and considering the suffering of the people below, holding firm to our resolve with prudence, navigating through the autumn of wind and rain, awaiting the time when [the Xiongnu ruler's] leather belt turns [denoting peace], and the majestic passes disperse the valiant troops, when the Peach Forest disbands its armor, and the armory [stores away] yellow bird flags. When people harbor the resolve to unleash [a hurricane], and the nation achieves great prosperity, then the goods of all industries will be abundant, and the benefits of all the land will be secured. Looking back on the hardships of today, we will then recognize the true flavor of success. As we celebrate the First Industrial Festival, I offer [this humble writing] and wish to encourage all those in the national industrial community!

### From Celebrating the Industrial Festival to Promoting National Goods

— Hu Bo Xiang

Today is the first anniversary in Chinese history. The significance is self-evident. Our country was originally based on agriculture, regarding industry as a secondary occupation. In addition, since the establishment of the Republic of China, wars have been frequent. Although knowledgeable people in the country have advocated for industry, they have been unable to fulfill the desire to build the country through industry, due to strong neighbors surrounding us. After the eight-year war of resistance, although industry suffered severe destruction, victory belonged to us, so the whole country has deeply recognized the importance of industrial construction. This is something that fellow industrial colleagues should celebrate.

The decline of industry is related to national power, which is already known to everyone. Before the War of Resistance, European and American countries, along with our eastern neighbors, used their superior industrial equipment to regard our country as the end of [the line] for disposing of surplus goods, forcing domestic factories to be unable to compete with them, resulting in long-term trade deficits, which caused the main cause of national weakness and poverty. Therefore, the most important factor in developing industry is to promote national goods, so that people are aware of the use of national goods. If the production of factories is bound to increase, the increase in production will reduce costs and the sales price will naturally be low. Factories will thrive as a result. Industry will gradually develop, profits will not flow outward, the nation will become strong, and the people will be rich. Therefore, people with knowledge have risen up and encouraged people to develop the habit of using domestic products.

I feel this is important! In times of peace, we receive [goods] from abroad without paying attention to [the consequences]. If a war breaks out and traffic is cut off, we will suddenly find ourselves helpless. If we do not rely on foreign goods in peacetime, we can be self-sufficient even in the event of sudden changes. Why should we be embarrassed and [expose] our [weakness]? Therefore, on the anniversary of the Industrial Festival, I reiterate the importance of promoting national goods to inform the people of the country, as an old man should speak up and take action to cultivate the foundation of industry. I also hope that people engaged in industry will pay close attention to the improvement of technology and the improvement of materials, so that people will be happy to adopt them and dispel the mentality of worshipping foreign goods. I hope that the industrial community will encourage each other.

### Hope

— Rong Hong Yuan

China has always been an agricultural country, paying little attention to industrial construction, ignoring the importance of "industry" in achieving wealth and power, and in building the nation. This has led to national weakness and poverty, making it impossible to be self-sufficient. During the War of Resistance, our fragile and immature industry was almost completely destroyed. Since the victory, observing the trends of the world and examining the current state of the country, we know that it is difficult to compete with other countries if we do not strive for industrial construction and strengthen our economic power. Switzerland, a small country, has 44% of its people engaged in industry. Molotov, in his speech commemorating the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, said: "Although devastated by the war, the Soviet Union's industrial production has recovered to pre-war levels" (see Moscow broadcast on the 7th). MacArthur is helping Japan in every way to restore its industrial level to the level of 1934. Looking back at the industrial production situation in our country after the victory, I don't need to say more. Everyone must have felt that the future is very bleak. The ancients said: "Hardships revitalize the nation." As long as we wake up early and strive to become stronger, how can we improve the equipment and increase the production of existing factories? Those who have not yet set up factories and have the financial resources should quickly invest in industry, study industry, and devote their lives to industry to revive China's economic construction as their own responsibility, serve the country, contribute to the country, and strive for the country's strength and glory. At the same time, I hope that the workers will uphold the principle that "there is work only when there is a factory," and work together through thick and thin, coordinate labor and capital, strive to increase work efficiency, and continue to produce, so that there is no idling for even a minute or a second, resulting in intermittent production, which threatens the country's economic lifeline. Today, when most of the people in the world are struggling on the hunger line, and most Chinese people are trapped in the tragic cruelty of war and the painful abyss of currency inflation, the only way to save social life from suffering is to do our best to restore the pre-war level of industrial production and actively develop new industrial construction in order to survive in the world. I am delighted to celebrate China's first Industrial Festival. I offer my warm expectations and hope to encourage my colleagues in the industrial community.

### Interpreting the Meaning of "Industrial Festival"

— Gong

A name that can be passed down through the ages, spreading from mouth to mouth, must have a high meaning and deep connotation. However, if it is learned but not examined, it will eventually become obscure. Therefore, on the occasion of the celebration, the meaning of designating November 11 as Industrial Festival will be explained in detail: Tracing back to the period of the Anti-Japanese War, this association assisted the government in devoting itself to industrial construction. Although the equipment was simple and resources were scarce, it was still able to supply military needs above and civilian use below. Then, after the Yi chieftain surrendered, this association returned east and convened the First National Congress in the capital from November 9 to 11, 35th year of the Republic of China. It was generally believed that China's industry had always been backward. It was not until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War that the importance of industrial construction was felt. The Chinese Industrial Association was thus established, laying the foundation for China's new industry. Its significance is extremely important. Therefore, the Executive Yuan approved the designation of November 11 as "Chinese Industrial Festival" for commemoration and encouragement. This is the origin of the Industrial Festival's designation and the selection of November.

The date of the congress was chosen on the 11th for three reasons. Examining the past and present, the double date of the month is a good festival. Starting from January 1, February 2 is the Flower Festival, March 3 is the Shangsi Festival, April 4 is Children's Day, May 5 is the Dragon Boat Festival, July 7 is the Qiqiao Festival, August 8 is Father's Day, September 9 is the Chongyang Festival, and October 10 is National Day. Although there are differences between yin and yang, there are no differences between ancient and modern sentiments. In addition, the date of completion of the congress coincided with the double date of the month, using the combined strength to plan universal development. Although it was the founding date of this association, it was actually the beginning of the new industrial construction. The meaning is very deep, so this date was chosen as the festival, not only for commemoration but also to wake up sight and hearing. This is the origin of the selection of the 11th for Industrial Festival.

Not only that, ten is the end of the number, and one is the beginning of the number, circulating and turning, with endless breath. Therefore, prosperity is followed by decline, and the extreme of decline is followed by restoration. The two characters of eleven contain the meaning of the extreme of decay followed by restoration. Tracing back to our country's industry, it originated very early. At that time, the folk customs were simple and honest. Huan Kuan said that industry is for the preparation of machinery. By the end of the Zhou dynasty, industry suddenly flourished. Guanzi said: "The cinnabar paint and Mao Yu of Longshu, the leather bones and ivory of Jingyang, and the Nanzi bamboo arrows of Jiangnan are waiting for work to be completed." Moreover, Mozi and Luban were born (carpenters still worship Ban as their ancestor), which made the industry revive. The records in Mozi can still be reviewed. The chapters on preparing ladders, preparing breakthroughs, and preparing holes can be regarded as the rise of machinery. Moreover, his 300 disciples mourned that our country has always looked down on industry, and no one succeeded him. Therefore, the Mo school declined, so that our country's industry has made no progress for more than 20 years, which can be said to be the extreme of decay. Now, although industry has been destroyed by the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, it can still continue to thrive, laying the foundation for perseverance and unyielding. Looking forward to the future, it contains endless hope. Moreover, the Industrial Association Law has been officially promulgated by the government, so that the Industrial Association has the status of a legal entity. This is the meaning of the Industrial Festival being designated on November 11.

Before the celebration congress, the Shanxi Provincial Industrial Association telegraphed to inquire about the meaning of the Industrial Festival being designated on November 11. Although it was replied by telegram, the text was simple and brief, and it was not clear. I know that there are more than one province and one association with doubts. Therefore, taking advantage of the celebration, I wrote an article to explain, so that those engaged in industry can understand its meaning in detail without being confused. Then, my words may not be superfluous!

### The Tasks That Should Be Done to Celebrate Industrial Festival

— Zhuang Zhi Huan

Since the end of World War II, most countries in the world, with the exception of a few, have generally experienced unrest. This phenomenon continues to exist and expand. The same is true in our country, so people from all walks of life feel that the future is full of difficulties. In particular, the industrial community, due to the lack of raw materials, has made various industries show a state of paralysis. It is also impossible to start improving it. However, due to the general trend of the world, we do not need to be pessimistic. We must open a way out in this difficult environment!

Our country's industry is still backward, and all the equipment and scale are relatively simple, but in the current environment, it is an opportunity to catch up quickly and make progress toward the future. This opportunity should be well used by our industrial community. Regarding the future of our country's industry, we do not hope to have large-scale factories like the United States. As long as we promote healthy small and medium-sized factories, the reason is that we do not have enough financial resources, the lack of industrial and technical talents, and the difficulty of managing large-scale factories with concentrated workers, so it is not suitable to build larger factories. If we can really achieve the plan of promoting healthy small and medium-sized factories, we can already make our industry enter the right track and gradually promote it.

Today is the first Industrial Festival. It is a great anniversary for those engaged in industry in our country since the beginning of history. On this anniversary, we who are engaged in industry should be vigilant, make a general review of the past, and have a big plan for the future. It can also make the people of the country understand the significance of the country's need for industrial development. If every industrial worker can review the past and plan for the future every year today, the development of our country's industry will definitely have a bright future, and it is also hoped that in the future, there will be a grand industrial exhibition every year on this anniversary to show the efforts and progress of the industrial community.

### Prospects for the Industrial Festival

— Yin Zhi Zhong

At the current stage of deepening industrial crisis, we suddenly encounter the first Industrial Festival today. We are both filled with infinite emotion and pinned with endless hope. But what I am emotional about is not our industrial backwardness, but only our industrial setbacks. Because Chinese science has not been developed, since the opening of the sea ban, it has been poisoned by the corrupt politics of the Qing Dynasty, which has caused the country to remain in the feudal agricultural village for a long time, so it has hindered the opportunity to accept science. It was not until the last four or five decades that from handicraft to hand-mixed industry, and gradually to some machine-made manufacturing industry, so industrial backwardness is due to congenital defects and cannot be forced. If the government could understand the importance of industry to the country after the success of the first National Revolution, and rush to catch up, build factories, develop raw materials, and cultivate technical talents, using our vast manpower and relatively cheap wages to compete with other countries, the hope is still very high, and the effect is still very fast. Industrial backwardness is not the main factor that restricts industry.

If we want to talk about the world's advanced industrial countries, of course, we must recommend the UK as the leader, especially the development of the textile industry, which makes people beyond reach. However, Germany, Japan, the United States, France, and other countries are more advanced than China, but they are far behind the United Kingdom. However, because of the government's promotion and the people's construction, various light and heavy industries are progressing simultaneously. They are not reduced because of the industrial backwardness of the United Kingdom. On the contrary, many industries have come from behind. Before the Second World War, they were allied and parallel with the UK in industry and dominated the world. Among them, Japan's development of industry was also after the Meiji Restoration. The era of China is not long, but its productivity is enough to make Europe and the United States look sideways, and China is shocked. It is not reduced because of backwardness. If China also works hard to build like Germany and other countries, with China's large population and strong production and consumption power, why would it be inferior to the UK, the United States, Germany, Japan, and other countries, and actually abandon itself and wander in the tragic situation of "agricultural China." This source of disease is lurking because it cannot cultivate industry, but instead mourns the loss of industry. So I said that the underdevelopment of Chinese industry is not in the backwardness of industry, but in the setbacks it has suffered.

The setbacks of Chinese industry are indeed related to the internal and external troubles and wars in the past years, and the government's failure to guide and promote it is still the biggest reason. First, the government cannot protect industry, the customs allow unlimited imports of foreign goods, and foreigners have special rights to reside in China, such as using concessions to set up factories, using extraterritorial rights to enslave labor, and using strong funds to monopolize domestic raw materials, collude with Chinese officials, and force the struggle of small factories. These are all major setbacks suffered by Chinese industry.

Furthermore, the Chinese government has not recognized the importance and independence of Chinese industry. It has always regarded industrial organizations as appendages of commercial organizations. It seems that industrial products are to be sold for money, so they are commodities and should belong to the scope of commerce, but it has forgotten its independent production!

But after the continuous struggle of the industrial community, the government has been able to change its plans suddenly and has recognized that the industrial community should have a transcendent and independent organization, and has officially promulgated the industrial regulations not long ago. This bright measure of the government is worthy of our congratulations, and now the responsible personnel of the government and the people in the industry also often discuss and are able to humbly accept the various industrial requirements. Compared with the past, there has indeed been a big difference! From now on, the industrial group is a healthy and legal institution. It can shoulder the responsibility of developing industry and building industry, and can eliminate the setbacks it has suffered in the unified cooperation of the country.

Spring and Autumn

### Review of the Second Woodcut Exhibition

— Shi Liang Fu

The emerging woodcut has been nurtured by the War of Resistance and developed to the present stage. It has indeed grown stronger. Most of the artists' interests tend to "large-scale" and "color" creations. This time, there are very few "small pieces" exhibited. The largest ones are two or three feet long, and the most color versions are five or six colors. Compared with the local wood exhibitions during the War of Resistance, it is incomparable. Regarding the composition and skills of large-scale and color versions, generally speaking, they are all very good, but after a strict review, some are indeed worthy of our appreciation, and some are also worthy of criticism.

In terms of success, the color versions include Ren Lu's "Mourning", A Yang's "Spring Festival", Di Zhi's "Difficult Lunch", and Ke Ping's "Hard Work Vision", etc., which all show a high degree of aesthetic feeling in terms of composition, color, knife technique, and printing skills. Although some people at the meeting criticized Di Zhi's painting for not using a light yellow background and should use other sad colors as the background, I don't think so, because it is the happiest thing in the world for the children to get lunch, then the light yellow atmosphere shows relaxation and joy, which is just right. We should appreciate and praise the painters' hard work in these places. Secondly, talking about monochrome versions, in my opinion, the works of Xi Ya, Yong Yu, and Zi Yi are the best. Xi's "City Story", "Autumn Suburbs", "Stroll", "Persuade", Yong Yu's "Miao Dance", "Bath", "Tell Stories", "Pick Wheat Ears". Zi Yi's "Rest" and other works, in addition to having a strong poetic interest, can also express the essence of ancient Chinese woodcut skills in the engraved lines. I think these masterpieces of theirs can be regarded as the representative works of this whole wood exhibition. Although there are also excellent works by Li Qun, Ye Fu, Liu Lun, and Zhu Minggang, their composition and knife skills are still inseparable from the style of Soviet woodcuts. Although Minggang does not have much of a Soviet style, but every "line" is too unified and lacks variety, which makes people have no new feeling. This is also a shortcoming.

In terms of shortcomings, we feel that the works of Aigan account for as many as 20 or 30 pieces in this exhibition. Among these 20 or 30 pieces, only one color version is quite successful, and the rest are relatively rough, such as "Taiwan Coal Yard", "In the Carriage", "Kaohsiung Field", "Waiting for Crossing", etc., and the composition is not very accurate. Furthermore, such as Ke Tian's paintings, the length is so large, but the scene is so empty, it is better to select two or three featured works to show, which can give people a good impression.

In addition, several famous woodcut artists, such as Huang Yan, He Heng, Ye Fei, and Sha Yue, did not have works in this whole wood exhibition, which is also very inferior.

### Excerpt of Inscriptions on Hu Yaguang's Portraits

Like Lu Danlin's, Da Qian adds scenery, Xia Jing Di

When the wonderful pen stops and portrays, it can imitate Lu's beautiful posture; Wu costumes show Zhang's hands even more, and the simple Yue cloth garment is very similar.

Again, Yang Tian Ji

Danlin on paper calls to life, Yaguang's portrait pen can do it; Autumn mountains are full of red, but there is autumn heart that has not been written in truth.

Like Qian Ziyan, Zhang Shutong

The gentleman's appearance is clear and well-behaved, the gentleman's behavior is ancient Confucian; Early in life, he stepped into the Ming Dynasty, and the Danxi pen was full of spring splendor; The edict was passed down from the purple clay book, and the autumn sound of the autumn sounded in the sky of the wooden sky; The autumn sound of the autumn sounds worried, and the sails hang high in ten widths of reeds; When the Jiang Zuo region will build a new capital, praised [their] magnificent plan; The Qin Huai wine stains [his] clothes, and the Jingjiang moon illuminates [his] robes. The bandit atmosphere suddenly rises in the eastern corner of the sea, and I will take a break in Songjiang; Hu Yaguang, the wonderful hand of portraiture, wrote this portrait for you; His spirit is radiant, his eyebrows and beard, and the old man of Songling can be called; Collection and books are better than leaving thousands of slaves; The world is waiting for you, may you not be a relict; If you should seek to ascend to the heavens, how different is it from the one in Hubei!

Like Tang Yun, Da Shi

A battlefield rises in front of Dashi Mountain, but [he] carries a pot of wine and gets drunk in the late spring; This madness is truly ridiculous, [he] is still the one who stood by and watched in those days.

Like Bao Tian Xiao, Man Weng

It is difficult to repay the teacher's love, and it is embarrassing to portray Wu Yan when old; I look like I am sitting idle in the shade of the pine, and I don't know what the next life will be like in this life.

### Professor (Woodcut)

— Ke Yang

### Yellow Dusk

— Zui Sheng

The time, it should be dusk.

If this is a moonlit night, on the clear blue sky, there is a bright comb-shaped moon hanging, and dense stars are scattered around. At that time, if you are leisurely walking in the cold streets and alleys, letting the clear light of the moon, like a light veil, cover the atmosphere around you, then you will deeply realize a kind of harmonious taste, in your nerves that are tired of the trivial matters of the day,

If you think the daytime is too annoying and midnight is too deep, then the most lovely will feel comfortable.

Listen! There came a burst of soft Xiao sounds, that tragic and sad tune, is it the sea love song of the poet? Or the sob of flowing water, or the remnant chirping of autumn insects! That desolate voice added a crack to the dusk air.

Are you a wanderer who is far away from your hometown! Then you will definitely feel your wandering heart, looking at the horizon, the clouds are vast, the ancient homeland is unknown, how much is desolate, the hometown thousands of miles away, the journey is long and the water is far away, buying a boat to go home, and waiting for what year and month?

The sound of the Xiao spread to the monks outside the ancient temple, the blue lamp, the red fish, that twilight bell of dawn life, who is willing to do it! Even if your Zen heart is like catkins, I am afraid you will not be able to restrain yourself, cherishing the prosperity of the world, and arousing warm reverie!

Boating in the dusk, what a poetic enjoyment it should be! A flat boat, floating on the lake, if you are with a close friend, facing the beauty, dark fragrance into your arms, will you think of the elegance of the Six Dynasties, in the depths of the bright moon, painting boats like clouds... But I think you will definitely be sad and gently whisper the poem "The prosperity is scattered with fragrance, the flowing water is merciless, spring is coming by itself"!

Dusk is also the best time to write. Whether it is the clear wind and bright moon, or the bleak wind and drizzle, in the quiet surroundings, who will come to disturb your quiet heart! If this is a moonlit and starry dusk, then you can write some beautiful essays, and what about the dusk of wind and rain? Tell you, it is most suitable to write some novels with tragic colors.

"The sunset is infinitely good, but it is near dusk." The rhyme of Suiyuan so deeply pulls the sorrow of middle-aged people long. Time flies like water, years are long, beauties are exhausted, and there is no way to stop time. You can only futilely complain about the passing youth, and how can you grasp it?

If you feel that the daytime is too annoying and midnight is too deep, then the most lovely time, it should be dusk.

The art review articles in this issue were originally scheduled to be published on Sunday, but were temporarily restricted by the length of the issue and changed to today. "One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood" will be suspended for one issue.

### After Viewing the Second Woodcut Exhibition

— Jie Ding

This spring, I saw the "First National Woodcut Exhibition" of the National Woodcut Association. The images that remained were: a strong sense of realism, and the serious attitude of the artists. But there were few new styles.

Although only half a year has passed since the first exhibition, this time's woodcut exhibition presents many new forms and new contents. In particular, the exploration in terms of form is surprisingly broad, while the content does not have the same strong sense of realism as the last time.

Chinese farmers love tranquility and brightness, like the New Year pictures and comic strips they favor, which are all in this style. The development of woodcuts in national form is also developing along this path. The new styles seen in this woodcut exhibition all present this trend. This is quite correct and worthy of attention.

The lines of the blade are the most creative. In the works on the "Woodcut Selection," most of the figures depicted use the lines with a metallic and stone-like flavor that he created, inspired by the patterns he extracted from the inscriptions on ancient bronze tripods and steles. However, the eight paintings "Four Directions" and "Four Seasons" this time are another kind of line. The "metallic and stone quality" has not been lost, but also added the gentleness and beauty of Western style, and the bright and simple style of national form to form a charming symmetry and poetic lines, such as the "Winter" (also named "Shu") in "Four Seasons," which is full of power without being rough.

Huang Yongyu and Xi Xing's styles and lines are unique. Xi Xing's are symmetrical and gentle, but the breaks in the lines also show firmness and the flavor of the knife. Several decorative paintings are very neat. "Stories in the City" has enough composition, knife flavor, and wood flavor. Huang Yongyu's lines are as imaginative as his conception. These lines are best used to draw fairy tales.

Mai Gan is striving to explore new forms. In the first woodcut exhibition, there was "Overturn," which had a very strong painting flavor. This time, there is "Returning to Mother's Home," whose degree of refinement is even better than the former. There is "The Japanese Devils Dragged Away Her Husband," carved with a single-edged knife; "Waiting for Ferry," carved with a small round knife; "Picking Fruit," a stone carving; "Sick Child," a paper carving; four exquisite pieces such as "Barbarian Woman Hulling Rice"; and "In the Carriage," a sketch in white with intaglio carving.

Many people admire Ke Ping's "Vision of Hard Workers," which is indeed a painting with harmonious colors and profound meaning. His optimistic attitude makes this scene extremely beautiful. "Steel Coming out of the Furnace" is also a very powerful painting. Li Hua's intaglio and powerful style, "Quickly Help Him In," "After Unemployment," and "Condolences" are all works of skillful technique. Ke Tian's "Hunger" fully expresses the anger of hunger, Li Cun Song's "Making Rubber" has a very strong satirical flavor in both content and form, and Zhao Yannian's "Reminded Of" is also very easy to evoke sympathy.

In the exhibition, there is a set of consecutive woodcuts by Li Zhigeng, "Huang Nius Is Forced to Climb the Ridge," with a total of twenty-five pieces from beginning to end. The form of engraving is unified, and the typical depiction is also very deep, but there is no tight connection in meaning, and it can only be regarded as a series of illustrations for a novel. In the production of consecutive woodcuts, I think there are still many places that need to be further discussed.

From here, we see an increase in color woodcuts. Originally, woodcuts should be black and white pictures, and it is best to be dominated by monochrome. Only monochrome woodcuts can express the wood flavor, knife flavor, and the contrast of light and dark, and become a unique art. For example, Sokolov's colored woodcut "Bridge" in Soviet woodcuts is simply not much different from oil paintings.

Finally, I wish the future of woodcuts here! If woodcuts can meet the needs of the people, strengthen the creation of national forms and New Year's flavor, and raise the banner of serving the people, instead of becoming ivory tower objects with other minority "artists," its future will be unlimited.

Southwest Clinic Serves the Poor and Sick

The Southwest Hospital outside the Small West Gate of this city was founded by the late famous doctor Zhu Rongsheng, and was well-known in Shanghai. It was severely damaged during the Anti-Japanese War, and its business was suspended for many years. It has now been repaired and renamed "Southwest Clinic," and will reopen on the 12th of this month. Medical doctor Wu Shiyuan and others will be hired to preside over the diagnosis and treatment of various departments, including internal and external medicine. Outpatient hours are from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Free for the poor and sick, it is truly good news for patients in this city.
