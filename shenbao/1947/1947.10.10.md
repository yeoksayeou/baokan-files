### Chairman's National Day Message to the People: Instructions on the Direction of Future Work; Clearing Obstacles to Build a Modern Nation

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] Chairman Chiang issued a National Day message to the people, a three-thousand-word document outlining the direction of compatriots' work in the coming year. In the political sphere, to establish a foundation of democracy and the rule of law, raise the standard of elections, and rectify the political atmosphere. In the economic sphere, to implement livelihood-based policies, earnestly plan and support private enterprises, and resolve land issues. In the cultural sphere, to strive for independence of academic thought as a basic guideline for future cultural construction. In the social sphere, to practice diligence and frugality, to embrace a life of hardship, and to demonstrate self-reliance and a strong will. Finally, exhorting compatriots to work together towards the above four goals domestically, and to uphold the spirit of independence and the principle of peaceful cooperation externally, to stand on our own in the world, to build China into a unified and progressive modern nation, to quell the rebellion, and to clear the obstacles to national construction.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Chairman Chiang issued the "Message to the People on the 36th National Day of the Republic of China" on the eve of the Double Tenth National Day. The full text is as follows:

Today is the 36th National Day of the Republic of China. The Constitution of the Republic of China was promulgated on New Year's Day this year. The election of representatives to the National Assembly and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan will be completed within this year, and the Constitution will be fully implemented. As we commemorate the growth of the Republic of China during this period of transition from political tutelage to constitutionalism, we feel its significance even more deeply.

In the past year, the National Government convened the National Assembly, promulgated the Constitution, and gathered leaders from various parties and non-partisan individuals to participate in the government and jointly shoulder the responsibility of nation-building. In the coming year, we will welcome the birth of a constitutional government and complete the process of the National Construction Program. In these thirty-six years, patriotic people and the masses have gathered under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, striving to complete national construction and implement democracy. But in reality, first Yuan Shikai played with the provisional constitution and then discarded it; then feudal warlords, in the name of autonomy, carved out their own territories; and finally, communist bandits, under the guise of democracy, destroyed democracy. The constitutional history of the Republic of China is a record of the arduous struggle between the forces of nation-building and defending the law and the forces of betraying the nation and destroying the law. Today, democratic constitutionalism is approaching its final success, while the communist bandits' conspiracies and atrocities to subvert the foundation of the nation and destroy the law and discipline have reached the most ferocious and cruel stage. We cannot allow democratic constitutionalism to fail. We must maintain social order, ensure the people's happiness, and, even more, consolidate territorial sovereignty to entrust a complete country to the soon-to-be-established constitutional government, which will be considered as fulfilling the responsibility of revolutionary nation-building. Since the National Army recovered Yan'an, the communist bandits have completely exposed their original features as roving bandits. On the one hand, they have mobilized troops from the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe border region, dispersing and fleeing in various directions. On the other hand, they have formulated an underground work program, directing their hidden party members and foreign elements in various places to incite various disturbances in the rear of the National Army, opening up their so-called "second front." But their main goal is still to hold on to Jiaodong, in order to maintain the transportation line between the bandits inside and outside the customs. Therefore, the initial purpose of the roving bandits crossing the Yellow River southward was to disperse the strength of the National Army, in order to support their offensive in the Northeast and relieve the crisis in Jiaodong. When the National Army swept through Jiaodong and recovered Yantai, the communist bandits' established strategy completely failed, and the connection between the bandits inside and outside the customs was completely cut off. Thus, they launched their so-called "Sixth Offensive" outside the customs, attempting to thoroughly destroy our Northeast's territorial sovereignty. Inside the customs, they attempted to establish a precarious base in the Tongbai Mountains and the Dabie Mountains, and even hoped to threaten the safety of the central Yangtze River region and hinder the general election in neighboring areas. I must point out here that no matter how fierce the communist bandits' activities in the Northeast are, they will inevitably follow the precedent of the Fifth Offensive and suffer thorough punishment.

### Pursuing National Self-Reliance with a Spirit of Respect for Law and Practicality; Premier Zhang's National Day Message

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun issued a National Day message on the eve of the Double Tenth Festival, entitled "Opening a Nation and Building a Nation." The full text is about two thousand words, first describing the domestic and international situation since the founding of the Republic of China. Secondly, it points out that today's internal affairs are a struggle between constructive forces and destructive forces, a struggle between democratic forces and anti-democratic forces; strengthening construction can offset destructive forces, and implementing constitutionalism is the way to eliminate anti-democratic forces. We should not place our hopes for construction after unification and stability. Regarding the construction problems of China today, Zhang strongly emphasized the importance of thrift, respect for law, and practicality. In conclusion, Zhang said: The world environment will no longer give China more time to hesitate. No matter what the situation is, we must pursue national self-reliance with a spirit of respect for law, practicality, hard work, and thrift.

### Zeng Qi Expresses National Affairs Thoughts

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] On the eve of National Day, Youth Party Chairman Zeng Qi expressed his thoughts on national affairs. He stated: To reverse chaos and restore order, to revive decline and invigorate, it is necessary to rectify the source and prescribe the right medicine. The world often sees rising prices and considers economic problems to be the most important, but I believe that politics causes military affairs, and military affairs affect economics, so political problems are still the most important. Although there are many solutions to political problems, the biggest key lies in constitutional governance. He also stated: To make constitutional governance successful, the three parties that jointly formulated the constitution must not hinder cooperation due to elections; we must absolutely maintain a democratic style and strictly prohibit bribery in elections, so as not to be laughed at by outsiders; we must establish a constitutional cabinet with broad inclusivity, embracing talent and not limited to the three parties; the whole country, from top to bottom, must strictly implement the constitution, regarding it as sacred and inviolable.

Our various reinforcement regiments are suppressing them, and the Air Force is also dispatched day and night to assist in the battle, so the area has become a decisive battle.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] The major battle between Changi, Weixian, and Gaomi has lasted for more than seven days and nights, and is still raging fiercely on the 9th. The National Army reinforcements are making great headway in their counterattack, and the situation in Fanjiace and Taitou has turned in their favor. The Air Force assisted in the battle and annihilated more than 5,000 communist troops in Sanhe Mountain, north of Fanjiaji.

[Our Weixian Dispatch, 9th] The battle near Hejiaji and Taitou northwest of Gaomi has extended to Yinma, west of Fanjiaji, since the 8th.

### Reflections on National Day

Today, we have once again reached the National Day of the 36th year of the Republic of China! On National Day, newspaper articles should have congratulatory remarks. During this period of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, as we look back on the past, review the present, and look to the future, we truly feel both joy and fear, with countless thoughts that are difficult to express in a single sentence. "People feel refreshed when they encounter auspicious events." On this annual National Day, as we recall the glorious achievements and the fruits of the revolution, we should cheer up and be joyful. However, looking around, not only is the domestic situation vastly different from that of the previous two years, but also major changes have taken place in the global situation. The future disasters are just beginning, and we should not have the elegant mood to indulge ourselves because of National Day.

On the National Day two years ago, it was not long after the victory. The international community was full of peaceful sunshine and optimistic atmosphere, and the domestic situation was also refreshing, with people all over the country immersed in the celebration of victory. How long did it last? A year passed quickly. By National Day last year, it had changed from splendor to blandness. The whole world was gradually shrouded in gloom, and the sound of fighting was heard everywhere in the country. But on this day last year, hope, though faint, had not yet been extinguished. The international haze was not impossible to disperse, and the domestic peace talks were still likely to succeed. This year, although the streets are full of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flags, as in previous years, most people's hearts are covered with heavy shadows, and their steps are heavy!

Let's first look at the global situation. After the war, the international situation has been turbulent. Despite the fact that some politicians and diplomats have been running around all year round, devoting themselves to creating world peace and opening countless international conferences, the problems have not only failed to find solutions, but have become more and more complex and worse. Although the existence of this situation is disheartening, last year, people still thought that the ideal of "One World" that had been longed for during the war could eventually be realized. Today, objective facts make us dare not even say that we can maintain a shred of hope for this. Not to mention anything else, just the reappearance of the European Communist International can tell us that the world today has reached the eve of division. Take a look at the United Nations organization, which has also reached a critical juncture of survival. The existence of the veto power prevents the United Nations organization from functioning. If it is to be revised, whether it is to be restricted or cancelled, there is the possibility of the Soviet Union withdrawing from the United Nations. US Secretary of State Marshall's proposal, if passed by the UN General Assembly, will inevitably arouse strong opposition from the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Vyshinsky has already expressed his determination to fight for his position on this. Looking at the world today, the confrontation of great national walls has gradually become clear. The formation of this trend is not the kind of all countries of the world; the world peace after the war has not yet been created, and the allied countries that fought side by side during the war have parted ways. If the new world crisis is not rescued as soon as possible, then the catastrophe of mankind will soon happen before our eyes. I ask, what mood do we have to celebrate?

What China urgently needed after the war was peace and stability. Externally, we hoped for international peace, so that we could bury ourselves in the work of reconstruction and national construction in a peaceful atmosphere. China has learned a bloody lesson from the eight-year War of Resistance. After the pain, it should have seized the opportunity to bury itself in national construction and strengthen its national strength. The longer international peace lasts, the more we can hope that our national strength will be abundant. Internally, we must also strive for stability. After the eight-year War of Resistance, both the country and the people were exhausted. Everyone needed stability so that they could rest and recuperate in a stable environment and have the opportunity to recover, and then they could embark on the road to national construction.

However, world peace seems to be getting farther and farther away, and the domestic situation in our country is disturbed by the communists, and the whole country is in turmoil, with almost no peaceful days. The people in the communist-controlled areas are no less than living in deep water and hot fire. Even in other places, due to the destruction of transportation and production by the communists, prices have soared and life has become difficult, and there is a so-called "people do not have the means to live" scene. Recently, the communists have been scurrying around in various provinces, making people displaced and unable to live and work in peace. Although the government has concentrated all its efforts on suppressing the rebellion, the effectiveness of suppressing the rebellion depends on the full cooperation of the people across the country. In order to cope with the future international upheaval and to relieve the suffering of the people, we should redouble our efforts to suppress the rebellion in the sound of National Day, so that the communists can be eliminated as soon as possible, the country can be stable, and then we can actively build the country and enhance our power to speak in the international arena, which will be beneficial to future world peace.

Welcome to the British Parliamentary Delegation to China

The British parliamentary delegation to China, led by Lord Ammon, a veteran of the British Labour Party, came to China for a personal visit. Due to bad weather, it was repeatedly postponed. It finally flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai at about 5:00 PM yesterday and immediately took the original plane to the capital to meet with the authorities in our country. We express our warm welcome to the members of the British parliamentary delegation to China and believe that this trip will have a significant impact on Sino-British relations.

First, although Sino-British relations have not been considered friendly in the past, since the Second World War, they have shared weal and woe, and the depth of their alliance is not superficial. Although there are still some problems to be solved through consultation, we believe that under the wise government of the British Labour Party, it will not be difficult to find a reasonable solution and open a new page in Sino-British relations. Today, Britain and North Korea are concerned about China, as Lord Ammon said: "Today, the extent to which our parliament and people care about China is the same as during the war." Our understanding of Britain's situation is also greater than ever.

Second, China and Britain are in almost the same position in today's world. During the war, China fought alone in Asia, independently supporting the war against Japan; after France's defeat and surrender, Britain also stood still and fought to the death with the Nazis. After the war, China and Britain suffered the greatest losses and made the most sacrifices, and they encountered many difficulties. They have not yet returned to their peacetime state. Therefore, China and Britain are not only wartime allies, but also friends in need after the war. They should help each other to overcome the current difficulties.

Third, the domestic and foreign policies of the British Labour Party cabinet are most worthy of our praise. The spirit of the rule of law and the clarity of domestic affairs are admired by the world. Its enlightened foreign policy has won praise from all countries in the world. Recently, the British cabinet has undergone a partial reorganization, appointing a large number of young and promising politicians, making the Attlee cabinet the most energetic government in the world, which is especially worthy of our emulation in order to reform our political style.

Fourth, although Britain's position in the international community has undergone major changes after the war, it is still one of the major countries related to the Far East. We want to tell the members of the British parliamentary delegation to China that the core of the Far East problem after the war lies in how to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression. Both China and Britain are willing to coexist peacefully with Japan, but they must not allow the reactionary forces of Japan to revive. Whether it is for China's security or for Britain's interests, being too indulgent with Japan and allowing its warlords and financial groups to resurrect will inevitably sow the seeds of future disasters. Therefore, China and Britain should stand on the same front in the future peace conference with Japan and oppose any measures that are too lenient with Japan.

The British parliamentarians are all visiting China for the first time and have no preconceived notions, making it easier to recognize the reality of China. We hope that after you return to your country, you will tell the people of the country the impression you have gained of how the Chinese people are struggling under the leadership of the government to overcome difficulties and the feelings of concern that the Chinese people have for Britain.

### Song Ziwen's Radio Address

(Continued from page 1) Song Ziwen's radio address briefly stated: "Since I arrived here, I have seen from all sides that my compatriots' lives are so difficult that I cannot sleep or eat in peace, and I am eager to think of a way to save them. Recalling that I was ordered by the Father of the Nation in the 12th year of the Republic of China to open the Central Bank, I was only approved to open the business with a fee of 3,000 yuan. Since I was ordered, I had to work hard to do it. The Father of the Nation also instructed me that doing things must be down-to-earth. The issuance of banknotes is not only convertible, but must also be convertible on the spot, and there must be sufficient hard currency income before the appropriate amount of banknotes can be issued, so that there will be no inflation. During the Northern Expedition, we would rather endure temporary pain than suffer long-term pain due to inflation. The Father of the Nation said at the British Bank opening ceremony that we can only eat eggs, not chickens. This is really the best way to manage everything. Relying on the instructions, I overcame all difficulties. By the time of the Northern Expedition, the Central Bank's banknotes even exceeded the face value of silver coins by one yuan per ticket. Later, I was ordered to be the Minister of Finance of the National Government and the Director of Finance of Guangdong. In the past, the highest annual income of Guangdong Province was only more than 20 million yuan. After I took over, it gradually increased to 100 million yuan. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek swore to start the Northern Expedition, and in the 16th year, he established his capital in Nanjing. The supplies of the Northern Expedition Army were fully supplied, which was all due to the fact that at that time, corruption was eliminated and every drop was returned to the public. Twenty years later, when I returned, the economy and finances of my Guangdong Province were difficult and exhausted, and it has come to this point. However, Guangdong is rich in produce, has a large population, and has many talents. As long as public officials throughout the province follow the Father of the Nation's instructions to be down-to-earth as the spirit of doing things, really think about it, really do it, eliminate corruption, and return every drop to the public, I believe Guangdong will become more and more stable and more and more happy."

### Serious Crisis Facing the Shipping Industry; Tonnage Increase Figures

(Continued from page 1) Li said, first of all, about the increased tonnage of national ships, that before the war, China's merchant ships had 500,000 tons. Forty percent were lost during the war. In the early days of the restoration, the remaining ships were less than 100,000 tons. By Double Ten Day last year, it increased to 491,979 tons. In the past year, it has increased by another 350,000 tons, and the total tonnage in the country is now 843,315 tons, of which China Merchants Bureau accounts for 300,000 tons, Minsheng Company more than 54,000 tons, China Tanker Company more than 52,000 tons, Yixiang Steamship Company more than 18,000 tons, and Dawei Datong more than 12,000 tons. Ships using coal and those using oil each account for half. Now the traffic on the Yangtze River, northern Jiangsu, Shanghai-Ningbo-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Taiwan, Shanghai-Qingdao, Shanghai-Tianjin, and Shanghai-Yushu lines is more convenient than before. There are also more than ten ships sailing to India, the South Seas Islands, and the Americas. The ships ordered by various companies from foreign countries will arrive in China one after another, with a total of about 200,000 tons. The goal of the initial construction of one million tons can be expected to be achieved soon.

Li then stated the importance of maintaining shipping rights, pointing out that in the past year, foreign merchants have repeatedly attempted to covet China's shipping lanes with various covers. Fortunately, the government and the people's crew members have continued to protect the newly recovered inland and offshore navigation rights, so that the integrity of the territorial waters can be maintained.

Soaring Costs

Li then reported that the soaring of navigation costs is the biggest pain of the shipping industry in the past year. For example, the increase in the cost of living for workers and the official price of coal has increased from 110,000 yuan per ton to 920,000 yuan. The official price of fuel oil has increased from 144,000 yuan per ton to 2,820,000 yuan. The shipping association has always been very careful about adjusting freight rates, so that the slowly increasing income cannot keep up with the rapidly increasing costs. Yesterday (8th), the price of oil distributed by Mobil, Asia, and other oil companies per ton was: refined diesel oil 4,060,000 yuan, medium diesel oil 3,810,000 yuan, heavy diesel oil 3,690,000 yuan, and fuel oil 2,820,000 yuan (including customs duties and surcharges), which is more than four times the previous distribution price. For example, the Jingxing Steamship needs 180 tons of oil for a round trip to Qingdao, which costs 507,600,000 yuan, and the income is only enough to buy oil. The remaining expenses such as wages, repairs, and supplies are not covered. Many oil-fueled ships have been forced to suspend operations. If this serious problem is not resolved urgently, most of the ships of various companies will also be forced to suspend operations.

[Another News] Du Rong, chairman of the association, and Qian Yongming, executive director, telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun yesterday to congratulate them on National Day, expressing their support for suppressing the rebellion and implementing the constitution.

### Our Pilgrimage Group Visits Jinnah

[Central News Agency New Delhi, 8th] Members of the Chinese Muslim pilgrimage to the holy land yesterday met with Pakistan Governor-General Jinnah. The group has now set off for Mecca.

### After the Establishment of the New Communist International, China's Red Bandits Will Become More Rampant; Wu Tiecheng Urges People to Suppress the Rebellion and Build the Nation

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 9th] A reporter from the Nanjing Central Daily News asked Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng yesterday about the future development and influence of the New Communist International on the Far East, especially China, after its establishment in Beijing. Wu said: The establishment of the New Communist International has made the turbulent international situation even more serious. The national freedom movement of various weak nations in the Far East and Southwest Asia will suffer adverse effects, and China's Red Bandits will take the opportunity to become more rampant, which goes without saying. Wu continued: Under this situation, the people of the whole country, especially the Kuomintang members, should be more vigilant for the sake of national security and national independence. They should be more vigilant in their respective positions and work harder for a goal with their abilities and financial resources. What is this goal? It is to suppress the rebellion and build the nation. Because the suffering of the people after the war is the price of sacrifice that should be paid for the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance. After the victory, this kind of suffering cannot be reduced, or even aggravated, which is all caused by the communists. We cannot allow the suffering of the people to continue for a long time, so the first thing we must do is to eliminate the communists.

Regarding the international significance of the Communist International Declaration, Wu said: After the Second World War, democracy rose, and under this mainstream, all relations between countries are mutual aid, not aggression. The New Communist International condemns the aid to Europe, South America, and the Far East by the United Kingdom and the United States as imperialist behavior, which is purely a political excuse. The Chinese have heard this kind of propaganda rhetoric from the communists countless times in the past 20 years. In short, justice cannot be separated from facts. Any false propaganda can only deceive people for a while, not forever.

### The Restoration of the Communist International Is a Diplomatic Gesture; Li Junlong Talks Before Leaving Hankou for Kaifeng

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] Li Junlong, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, took a special train from Hankou to Kaifeng this morning. Before leaving, he said that the main purpose of the Soviet Union's restoration of the Communist International was to use it as a bargaining chip in the UN General Assembly. The United States and the Soviet Union do not want to go to war at present. It is a big mistake to think that this is the prelude to the Third World War.

### Hunan Stabilizes Grain Prices; Adjustment Committee Established; Requests Provincial Government to Temporarily Impose a Full Transport Ban

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 9th] Since the opening of Hunan rice, grain prices have soared. In order to stabilize prices, the Grain Adjustment Committee was established on the 8th and decided that: (1) Military grain must be purchased in the designated producing areas. (2) Please ask the provincial government to temporarily impose a full transport ban. (3) Please ask the central government to keep a part of the grain in Hunan and not withdraw it. (4) The accumulated grain should be returned to the granary. (5) Encourage winter cultivation and provide loans. (6) Please ask the four banks to provide loans to purchase and store grain and use grain as collateral. (7) Crack down on speculation and strictly prohibit illegal grain operations by wealthy families and capital. (8) Suggest that the provincial government organize grain rationing for public employees and the poor.

### Hefei Daily Necessities Double in Price; City Defense Department Issues a Notice Prohibiting Price Increases

[Our Hefei Dispatch, 9th] Prices in Hefei continue to rise, and the prices of daily necessities have all risen by more than double. The living conditions of public employees have been unsustainable. The City Defense Headquarters issued a notice to merchants today, strictly prohibiting high prices.

### Management of Gold Ornaments Fixed Gold Price at Three Million Per Taels

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch on the 9th] The black market gold price outside of this city is impacting price levels in Taiyuan, causing unease in citizens' lives. The Price Stabilization Committee announced a provisional method for managing the buying and selling of gold jewelry on the 9th, fixing the gold price at three million yuan per tael. Except for silver shops, buying and selling are strictly prohibited. Citizens are being mobilized to form economic inspection teams to strictly monitor the selling prices of silver shops. The Price Stabilization Committee will decide on purchases at any time. If the gold quantity of merchants and civilians is insufficient, the committee will supply it, aiming to maintain the workers' livelihoods.

### Boats Prohibited from Anchoring Near the Qiantang River Bridge at Night

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 9th] Within 400 meters upstream and downstream of both the north and south banks of the Qiantang River Bridge, the security authorities have ordered a ban on anchoring boats at night starting from today. This measure is purely to prevent criminals from sabotage and ensure safety.

### Chen Cheng Visited the Northeast Cultural Relics Exhibition Yesterday The Exhibition Officially Opened Today

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 9th] The Northeast Cultural Relics Exhibition opened in the former Qing Palace. Today, leading figures from various agencies were invited. Chen Cheng visited in person, accompanied by Peng Ji-qun, Guan Ji-yu, Jin Zhen, and others. Mr. Chen wore a long robe and greeted everyone warmly, showing his high regard for the historical and cultural relics of the Northeast. He was particularly interested in the rubbing of the Qianlong emperor's "Imperial Inscription on the Complete Submission of the Turhut," which was inscribed on the walls of the Guanju Palace, describing the submission of the Kazakh Burt banner on the Mongolian-Xinjiang border, an event that Russia had tried to prevent. He ordered his staff to copy it. Chen also examined the specimens of two giant brown bears captured by Qing Taizu Nurhaci during hunts for a long time, saying, "These cannot be subdued by human power."

The Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing for October 15th. The plaintiff's lawyer is Zhang Shizhao, who will appear in court on their behalf. The Binhu Construction Promotion Association and the Xiang River Conservancy Association are collecting various materials and sending them to Mr. Zhang for reference. If necessary, the plaintiffs, including Chen Yunzhang, will go to Beijing to appear in court.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders Strengthening of River Defenses

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 9th] To prevent the Communist bandits in the Suwan area from returning to northern Jiangsu and crossing the Yangtze River by stealth, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has telegraphed the special commissioners and county magistrates of various districts to increase vigilance, cooperate with the National Army, and strengthen river defenses. In case of emergencies, temporary martial law will be implemented for prevention.

### Announcement

On the joyous occasion of Double Ten, the whole country celebrates. Our newspaper is specially publishing an additional three and a half pages on this auspicious occasion, with many articles focusing on the heroic and tragic historical events of the revolution, or words of praise and encouragement. Not only are they rich in historical value, but they can also inspire the will to quell the rebellion and mobilize. Due to limited space, the articles from all parties could not be published. We extend our gratitude and apologies. Furthermore, the printing and typesetting were rushed, resulting in an error in the article "China's Shipping in the Past Eighty Years." In the last line of the twenty-first page, "must be undertaken by British ships" should connect to the fifteenth line of the seventeenth page, "transportation, otherwise willing to not accept relief." We hereby correct the error, hoping that the author and readers will understand!

### Chairman's Message to the National People

As for the internal bandit army, it is already in an isolated situation. The National Army will be able to strictly pursue and encircle and annihilate the bandit remnants south of the Yellow River, and will never allow their conspiracies to succeed. However, we must be vigilant that, in this short period after the failure of the Communist bandits in Jiaodong, as long as the National Army and governments at all levels have any negligence, they will surely take the opportunity to stir up trouble, with riots at any time in the countryside and disturbances everywhere in the cities. The purpose of this kind of perverse behavior is to destroy the stability of society. Only by working together with the government, holding steadfastly with determination, and upholding unwavering faith can we smash their conspiracies and make concerted efforts in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and society to eliminate these bandits who destroy the country, undermine the constitution, and disturb the people's livelihood, and complete the mission of quelling the rebellion and building the nation.

Future Work Directions for the Coming Year

I, Zhongzheng, sincerely point out the direction of work for the coming year, and I deeply hope that all compatriots across the country will work together to make it a reality.

Political Direction (1) In the political aspect, it is imperative to establish the foundation of democracy and the rule of law, improve the level of elections, and rectify political conduct. This needs to be explained in two points: A. After the Constitution was promulgated on New Year's Day this year, election laws and regulations were promulgated as scheduled, and the registration of electors and candidates in various provinces and cities has been completed in sequence. The election campaigns of candidates in various provinces and cities are also in full swing. It must be understood that the success or failure of this election will determine the success or failure of constitutional government. Electors must carefully cast their sacred vote, and candidates should respect and love themselves even more, correct all the abuses of the elections in the early Republic of China, and put forward political views for the free choice of the vast electorate. We must make the elections have a rigorous atmosphere before we can expect the elections to have noble achievements. We can say that this year's election is the pivot of the reconstruction of the Republic of China and the indicator of the revival of the Chinese nation. Only when all the people of the country can choose the representatives they can trust to exercise political power can we hope that all the people of the country can support the democratic constitution to last forever. B. The foundation of democracy lies in the rule of law. As the decree to prepare for constitutional government is about to be completed, the government and the people must work together to seek the implementation of the spirit of the rule of law. The people should develop the habit of abiding by the law, and officials should base everything on the law, striving to make the political atmosphere move towards rectification, and the people's rights are guaranteed, and advance together on the right track of the rule of law. Only then can the democratic system have a solid foundation.

Economic Aspect (1) In the economic aspect, it is necessary to implement facilities for the people's livelihood. In particular, we must carefully plan for the support of private enterprises and the solution of land problems. After the end of the war, economic construction is the unanimous requirement of the country. The central goal of economic construction is to solve the land problem in the process of industrialization, so that social production can be increased, the people's lives can be improved, and the increase in the purchasing power of the rural areas will cultivate a vast market for industrial products, which is the basic condition for urban prosperity. We know that the industrial policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to restrict monopoly capital from manipulating the people's livelihood with a state-owned system, so as to protect the free development of general private enterprises. The government's tax system and the bank's investment policy should be in line with this policy. Only then can social production be expected to progress and export trade can be expected to increase. It must be understood that enriching the people is the way to seek the increase of national strength. I, Zhongzheng, put forward this principle to all compatriots across the country on the Double Ten Festival the year before last, as a guide for post-war national construction. Today, I reiterate this idea, and I deeply hope that the economic circles across the country can cooperate with the government to ensure its effective implementation and lay the foundation for the Chinese nation to be self-reliant.

Cultural Aspect (2) In the cultural aspect, we must strive for the independence of academic thought. Long before the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I, Zhongzheng, pointed out to the cultural circles that "the Second World War can be said to be a cultural war. The success or failure of nationalism, democracy, and socialism in Europe and the United States in the past 350 years all lie in this war, and the rise and fall of China's 5,000-year-old culture and its moral spirit are also the touchstone for this war." More than two years have passed since the end of World War II, and the international cultural struggle and political situation have become increasingly intensified. Chinese culture has also suffered from the political struggle of the Communist bandits. The national spirit of firmness and bravery during the War of Resistance Against Japan has been lost and gradually declined, especially the intellectual youth have not been able to develop independent and autonomous thinking ability. A part of them even follow others, are played by others, and abandon their original intention of studying, willing to be used as tools for political struggle. People who love the country and worry about the times are all deeply saddened by this. It must be understood that since the history of our Chinese nation, although it has been repeatedly subjected to foreign invasions, it has still been able to stand still and survive majestically, relying on the national confidence to resist the invasion of foreign races, and has always been maintained without falling. When the country is in danger, it can still be revived, but if the culture perishes, there will be no hope of recovery. Therefore, the independence of academic thought is the basic guideline for cultural construction in the future. I hope that the national cultural circles will catch up quickly and go to this noble goal together.

Social Aspect (3) In the social aspect, we must practice a diligent and thrifty life, and we must develop the ambition of self-reliance and self-improvement. It must be understood that extravagance is the root of national subjugation, and waste is the enemy of national construction. After the World War, all countries in the world are doing their best to encourage production and conserve consumption in order to engage in post-war revival. Look at the United Kingdom, which is strictly practicing austerity and restricting consumption, how thorough it is. Even the United States, which has a strong economic power, has recently called on its people to reduce food consumption. Other emerging countries are working hard to encourage each other and striving to be self-reliant. Moreover, our China has experienced such a long period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and has been added to the destruction of the Communist bandits. The entire society is devastated and the nation's humiliation is deep. If we are still ignorant and follow the old ways, and do not know how to be vigorous, or waste without limit, or be lazy and complacent, then not only will the post-war revival be hopeless, but the entire nation will inevitably be eliminated and will not be able to survive. In the past two years, I have repeatedly alerted my compatriots that "the post-war hardship must be many times greater than that of the War of Resistance Against Japan." Today, I would like to solemnly exhort my compatriots across the country to be sure to thoroughly repent and be self-reliant with shame, eliminate the bad habits of extravagance, waste, being opportunistic, and being fluke. On the one hand, we must tighten our belts and work hard, and on the other hand, we must rely on our own efforts to overcome difficulties. This is the only way for our country to build the nation. Every compatriot must fulfill his responsibility to the country and seek survival for himself. He must have the ambition to improve and make painstaking efforts. I also hope that social leaders will practice what they preach and promote it as much as possible in order to create a national construction style and promote the success of national construction.

Compatriots, at this important juncture of quelling the rebellion and building the nation, we must recognize that the safety of the country and the nation depends entirely on our efforts today. On the domestic front, we must establish the foundation of democracy and the rule of law, implement facilities for the people's livelihood, strive for the independence of academic thought, practice a diligent and thrifty life, and develop the ambition of self-reliance and self-improvement. On the foreign front, we must uphold the spirit of independence and self-reliance, and the purpose of peaceful cooperation, in order to stand on our own in the ever-changing world of international affairs, so as to build China into an independent, unified, and progressive modern country, quell the rebellion of the Communist bandits, and eliminate the obstacles to national construction, so as to comfort the spirits of the founding father of the Republic of China and the revolutionary martyrs.

### Lovett Condemns New Communist International for Intentionally Sabotaging European Recovery Affiliating Countries Should Bear All Responsibility

[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] Acting US Secretary of State Lovett announced today: if the Communist Party Information Bureau, recently announced at the Warsaw Conference, succeeds in its plan, it will inevitably cause the European economy to collapse. Lovett's full statement is as follows: "The US State Department has closely examined the materials on the meeting of representatives of Communist Parties from nine European countries published in the Soviet newspapers, as well as the resolution of the establishment of the Information Bureau (including representatives of the central committees of the Communist Parties of each country) in Ziegeler. At the same time, the State Department has also found that responsible cabinet members (including the Soviet Union) from several countries are included among these representatives. The words of the Warsaw Conference Declaration are deliberately defamatory of the goals of the British and American people in the Great War and distort US policy. Its wording coincides with the arguments of Communist newspapers in various regions. The documents issued by the Warsaw Conference make it clear that the governments and parties involved in this plan have expressed their determination to do their utmost to prevent the economic recovery of Europe. The European people, all those who voluntarily believe in this malicious announcement, should bear their own responsibility. Because if the ideas of the Warsaw Conference exist, then the collapse of the European economy will be inevitable. We must remain calm and clear in our judgment and not leave our posts, and continue to examine with sympathy and calm reality how Europe can regain its place in a peaceful and stable world."

[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] Lovett declared: There has been significant progress in the technical discussions between countries on the Marshall Plan, and statements on some aspects of it will be issued within ten days. At present, technical committees from various countries are holding meetings in Washington, and members of the Executive Committee of the Paris Conference (including British representative Frank and French representative Erfen) are about to come here to participate. Regarding the issue of US interim aid to Europe, Lovett stated: The government is determined to do its best to take out the last dollar in the existing fund to aid Europe. When reporters asked whether the US had obtained "sufficient funds" for France, Lovett replied that the funds obtained were "not sufficient." He hoped that the meeting in Brussels would distribute the gold bars obtained by Germany as soon as possible, and if that were the case, France might obtain sufficient funds.

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] Diplomatic personnel here are deeply impressed by Lovett's powerful statement. It is expected that this statement was drafted after detailed discussions with Secretary of State Marshall and close study of all the circumstances related to this Communist action. Lovett also revealed that Ambassador Smith, who returned to the US from Moscow on the 7th, will report to the State Department today and will go to New York to review the general US-Soviet relations with Marshall.

He is determined to have the Foreign Affairs Committee consider President Truman's plan to make 580 million available to cover European shortages, pending congressional action on the long-term Marshall Plan. Committee members who previously opposed assistance have all "changed their positions" due to recent developments and the deteriorating situation.

Moscow hopes to reopen trade negotiations as soon as possible, but requests that the previous debts be negotiated first, and asks for concessions on the repayment terms.

### Trade between Eastern and Western Europe Needs to Be Restored Clayton Expresses Optimism

[Our report] New York, 9th Broadcasting: Washington News, US Undersecretary of State Clayton told a press conference today: Although trade relations between Eastern Europe and Western Europe are currently frustrated due to political differences, he believes that they will eventually be restored sooner or later.

### British Attitude Turns Tough on Trade Preference System Issue

### British Gold Reserves Almost Depleted British Economy Faces Desperate Situation Cripps Appeals to the United States for Assistance

[Reuters, London, 9th] Economic Minister Cripps told a press conference today that if Europe and the UK do not obtain new sources of dollars in the near future, they will have to further reduce imports from the dollar area, which is the beginning of a strategy that must be adopted. If this is not stopped quickly, the British economy will gradually be suffocated.

We have no other way to escape. We have begun to use gold and dollar reserves. The amount of this reserve is not large and is for the entire sterling area. Other countries may also face the same problem, and there will be no way to deal with their people. If the remaining 400 million yuan of the US loan to Britain can be unfrozen, it is quite possible that Britain can get through this year, but the future development still depends on the extent to which we use our reserves. I do not believe that British exports to the US can be balanced with US exports to Britain. Britain should reduce imports and increase production to expand exports to make up for its trade deficit. However, the problem of trade deficit with the dollar area is still unsolvable. This is a difficult problem to control the entire world economy. We cannot get out of difficulties until it is solved.

[United Press, London, 9th] Authoritative sources said that Britain will sell another 80 million US dollars worth of gold reserves to the US this week to make up for its shrinking dollars. This is the second time in three weeks that it has sold gold reserves to the US. The last time was on September 15, when 80 million were sold. Although the government's remaining gold reserves are kept strictly secret, it is estimated that there are only 2.244 billion yuan left.

### UN Political Committee Passes US Proposal Establishes Balkan Inspection Group Vyshinsky Severely Reprimands US

[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The United Nations General Assembly's Fifty-Seventh Committee tonight passed the case to establish a Balkan Surveillance Group with 30 votes in favor and six votes against. The Soviet bloc countries voted against it. The meeting also passed a clause in the U.S. proposal by a vote of 39 to 6, requiring Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece to cooperate with the Special Monitoring Group, but another clause requiring the General Assembly to decide on the implementation of assistance to the three countries of South Albania and Bulgaria in handling border affairs has not yet been put to a vote.

US Representative Johnson expressed agreement, but only on the condition that the three countries recognize the UN Balkan Monitoring Group. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky immediately rose and spoke with a severe tone, accusing the United States of intimidating the three countries of South Albania and Bulgaria with a "final solution". He claimed that this is a demand, a final ultimatum, not a solution, and representatives should not be subject to this "despicable act". Vyshinsky also turned to Johnson and scolded: "If you can get a majority, you can do this, but why attach conditions?" At the same time, the Cuban representative formally proposed that the United Nations conduct a thorough investigation into the seven countries of Eastern Europe, expanding the original scope of investigation from the four countries of Greece, South, Albania, and Bulgaria to include Hungary, Romania, and Poland, all of which, except for Greece, belong to the Soviet sphere of influence.

The issue of whether a question submitted to the Security Council is a situation or a dispute; Whether a member of the Security Council is in a position as a party to a dispute related to a certain issue discussed by the Security Council, and therefore needs to comply with the provisions of the Charter and not participate in the relevant voting; The issue of the conditions under which a non-member state of the United Nations may become a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice in accordance with Article 93 of the Charter; The issue of requesting the International Court of Justice to express its opinion on any legal issue submitted to the Security Council, or any legal aspect of a situation or dispute.

The states party to a dispute shall abstain from voting. The above-mentioned Chapter VI is about the peaceful settlement of disputes. The original text of Article 52, Paragraph 3 of the Charter is as follows: The Security Council shall encourage the development of the peaceful settlement of local disputes through regional arrangements or by regional agencies, either on the initiative of the states concerned or by reference from the Security Council.) (C) It

It is declared in the "separate" case that when the Security Council is discussing any issue submitted to it and cannot adopt a proposal voted on by a majority of seven or more members of the Council (including the four permanent members), the countries constituting the above-mentioned members may request the Secretary-General of the General Assembly to convene a meeting of the General Assembly to consider this issue.

### Confirmed Evidence of Audit Extortion Ten Tax Officials Prosecuted The District Prosecutor's Office Details the Process Liu Runxian and Three Others at Large

[Report from our newspaper] Tax Bureau officials Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yu Maojie, Zhang Baoping, Yang Renzheng, Zou Wenlong, Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, Wang Zonghuai, and Wang Rentang were previously accused by Zhang Zhongyuan and other woodware merchants in the city of corruption. After investigation by Prosecutor Zhu Xiyu of the District Prosecutor's Office, they were publicly prosecuted for corruption yesterday. The original prosecution roughly stated: "Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yu Maojie, Zhang Baoping, Yang Renzheng, Wang Rentang, Zou Wenlong, and the at-large Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, and Wang Zonghuai are all auditors of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. On August 15th of this year, in order to collect the first category of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 36th year, simplified collection procedures were implemented. It was stipulated that for each trade association with between 200 and 400 members, three companies would be sampled for every 100 members. The Shanghai Chinese Woodware Business Association has more than 250 members, and seven should be sampled. The bureau's sampling host put forward a list of 25 companies. Later, it was found that eight of them were not members of the industry, and they were eliminated after a statement. Therefore, 17 companies participated in the lottery. The seven companies that won the lottery were Zhang Senmao, Zhu Genji, Wufu, Yang Longxing, Zhang Wanli, and Zhang Wantai. On the 17th of the same month, the bureau notified the above-mentioned winning companies to bring their account books to the tax bureau on the morning of the 18th to wait for inspection. The bureau also assigned Zhang Baoping and Yu Maojie to check Zhang Senmao's account books by lottery, Yang Renzheng and Wang Zonghuai to check Yang Longxing's account books, Wang Rentang and Zhang Daru to check Zhang Wanli's account books, Liu Runxian and Zhang Wenhua to check Zhu Genji's account books, Wei Guangyu and Chen Zhijie to check Qiao Yuantai's account books, Jin Ruizhou and Li Yang to check Zhang Wantai's account books, and Gao Shijie and Xie Lianxun to check Wufu's account books. Because the account books prepared by the companies contained many errors and did not comply with accounting regulations, the auditors criticized them severely. When Zhang Xianliang, the manager of Zhang Senmao, explained to the auditors, Zou Wenlong heard the sound and came out. He learned that the account books of the companies all had major flaws and could be criticized, so he thought of taking the opportunity to extort. He first asked Zhang Xianliang if he knew any officials in the bureau who could be negotiated with. Zhang Xianliang named Zheng Gongda, a former employee of the bureau. Zou nodded, and then ordered Zhang to go back first. Immediately, he discussed the implementation of the extortion plan with Zhang Baoping, Yu Maojie, Wang Rentang, Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, and Yang Renzheng. They first warned the audit companies separately, saying that they had to pay supplementary taxes, ranging from 70 to 80 million to 100 million, in order to threaten them, and then reduced the price to extort money. It was also agreed that the Jinghua Restaurant would be the negotiation venue.

Negotiations at the Restaurant

On the afternoon of the same day at 5 pm, Zou Wenlong invited Zhang Xianliang to dinner at the Jinghua Restaurant in a common way. Zhang, forced by the situation, invited Yang Laoguan Niang, the owner of Yang Longxing, Zhu Jianni, the manager of Zhu Genji, Zhang Zhonghui, the head of Zhang Wanli, and Wang Yonglin to go with him. Zou Wenlong, Yu Maojie, Wang Rentang, Zhang Baoping, Yang Renzheng, Liu Runxian, and Zhang Wenhua also arrived one after another. Zou and Yu claimed to Zhang Xianliang that they had to pay at least 20 million. Later, Liu Runxian mediated and reduced it to 14 million, with half paying the tax and half serving as so-called entertainment fees. The Zhu Genji and Yang Longxing companies also did the same. Zhang Xianliang and others were intimidated by coercion and reluctantly agreed, but they insisted on paying 29 million for Zhang Wanli, which did not result and broke up. The Wufu auditors Gao Shijie and Xie Lianxun separately invited Cao Caigen, the manager of the company, to the Curry Restaurant, where Xie extorted 20 million and Gao reduced it to 14 million and stopped. Zhang Xianliang and Zhang Zhonghui reported Zou's extortion to Zhang Zhongyuan (the owner of Zhang Wanli), who in turn reported it to Speaker Pan and Senator Yang Fusheng of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Secretary Yan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The next day, Wang Rentang invited Shen Wenbin, an employee of Zhang Wanli, to lunch at the Tsinghua Alumni Association. Shen then went with Zhang Xianliang, but they still insisted on extorting 29 million from Zhang Wanli. Later, they automatically reduced it to 23 million. Wang Rentang said that the payment must be made by the 21st at the latest.

Depositing the Money in the Bank

On the morning of the 21st at about 11 am, Zhang Zhongyuan handed two checks from the Dadae Bank issued by Taiqi Service Agency, one for 20 million and one for 30 million, to Zhu Jianni, the manager of Zhu Genji, and Zhang Xianliang, the manager of Zhang Senmao, for Zou Wenlong to receive in person, in order to obtain active evidence and provide it to the Council for inspection. Zou deposited all the check money into his own account under the name of Deng Chuanzhi at the Chengdu Commercial Bank, in order to calmly divide it up. After Yan Yuansheng learned from Zhang Zhongyuan about the extortion by the tax bureau auditors, he telegraphed the bureau director Lou Guowei on the 20th. After Lou received the news, he ordered the主管 personnel to investigate. Wang and Zou knew that the incident had been exposed, so they withdrew the original 50 million from Deng Chuanzhi's account at the Chengdu Commercial Bank on the 23rd. The tax bureau side was unable to understand the situation due to rumors, so it sent the bureau's supervisors Yu Boyan and Fan Anfu to inquire at each of the 本器 companies to see if there was any extortion by auditors. The companies, because the truth was not clear and they were afraid of causing misunderstandings, each made a statement certifying that there was no extortion.

The Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office Thoroughly Investigated and Had Evidence

The newspapers were noisy, and the companies entrusted lawyers to send letters to the tax bureau, stating that the certification was invalid. The Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office of the Supervisory Yuan also sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and had evidence. The tax bureau detained Zhang Baoping, Yu Maojie, Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yang Renzheng, Wang Rentang, and Zhang Daru, who were suspected of being involved, and transferred the files to the侦査 office. Zou Wenlong also surrendered himself after the incident. However, Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, and Wang Zonghuai, who were also involved in the case, had all fled after hearing the news. After investigation, the evidence was indeed conclusive. The defendants were charged with the crimes of Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 1, Article 3, and Section 5 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption. In addition to Fan Anfu, the supervisor of the bureau, and Zhang Daru, the auditor, who were not prosecuted due to insufficient suspicion of committing a crime, the public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Lou Guowei Did Not Arrive and Will Be Summoned Again

### Kerosene Prices Also Rise Meeting Held at Any Time to Evaluate Prices in Case of Special Circumstances

[Report from our newspaper] The Fuel Group of the Shanghai Municipal Price Evaluation Council held its tenth evaluation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3 pm yesterday, deciding to adjust the negotiated price of kerosene. Starting this week, each barrel will be 2.2 million yuan (53 gallons per barrel, formerly 1.44 million yuan). Retail price is 6,000 yuan per liter (formerly 4,000 yuan).

The council also decided to adopt a flexible approach to kerosene pricing starting this week. In addition to the regular meetings every Thursday, meetings will be convened at any time to evaluate prices in case of special circumstances. Trade associations must report on the black market prices for the past week at the regular meetings every week as a reference for pricing, so that the negotiated price does not differ too much from the black market. According to the evaluation council, the reason why the kerosene negotiated price adopts a flexible approach is because the government cannot control or supply raw materials like sugar and coal, and hard control measures can be adopted. Various fuels are interrelated, and the actual supply and demand of kerosene are not balanced, so hard control cannot be enforced.

### Gasoline Prices Have Almost Doubled Should Be Corrected Immediately Senators Propose to Avoid Stimulating Prices

Municipal Senators Wang Jian'e, Lu Shidao, Li Wenjie, Zhu Wende, Jiang Pingfan, etc., yesterday submitted an urgent proposal to Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu, requesting the municipal government to immediately telegraph the Central Bank to correct the measure of doubling the price of gasoline in order to avoid stimulating price increases. The original text of the proposal stated: "Since the Central Bank promulgated the gasoline restriction measures in this city, high-priced black market gasoline has immediately appeared. Fortunately, this council decided to stipulate four measures: private cars can purchase gasoline every three days, cargo trucks can purchase 20 gallons of gasoline every three days, and the number of refueling times per month shall not exceed ten times. Gasoline must be added to the fuel tank, and if there is any hoarding, it will be investigated according to the law. After the implementation of this case, those who manipulate and speculate will restrain themselves slightly. Unexpectedly, before the recess was ten days old, the Central Bank suddenly used the excuse of foreign exchange fluctuations and increased tax rates to increase the price of gasoline from 13,000 yuan per gallon to 25,500 yuan, almost doubling, not only despising the hard work of this council to stabilize prices, but also stimulating price increases, causing a major fluctuation in the market, and prices of rice and other necessities have risen accordingly. To say that this is vigorously implementing national policy and suppressing prices is obviously close to ridiculous. Therefore, it is urgently proposed that the speaker should inform the municipal government to immediately telegraph the Central Bank to stop the measure of doubling the price of gasoline in order to avoid stimulating price increases, otherwise, the Central Bank shall be responsible for all consequences."

### Seventeen Groups Including Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Welcome Zhang Zhizhong and Chiang Ching-kuo, Attendance Exceeds 500, Situation is Enthusiastic

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Seventeen groups including the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the City Council, the General Labor Union, the Industrial Association, the Women's Association, the Money Trade Association, the Banking Association, the Municipal Fishermen's Association, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Lawyers Association, the Accountants Association, the Journalists Association, the Newspaper Trade Association, and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association held a grand tea party at Lido Garden yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to welcome Zhang Zhizhong and Chiang Ching-kuo, who were visiting Shanghai. Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Zhu Ping, Yan Zhuang, Xu Jiqi, and Shui Xiangyun all attended, with more than 500 people present.

Commanded the Two Shanghai Battles

After the music played and the meeting began, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, saying: "It is a rare grand gathering today that brings together people from all walks of life in Shanghai, including agriculture, industry, academia, and commerce. Recalling that Shanghai played an important role in both the January 28th Incident and the August 13th all-out war of resistance, both battles were commanded and led by General Zhang. After the Battle of Shanghai, it was stipulated that Shanghai would not be defended, so General Zhang devoted himself to the deployment around Shanghai. Because of the preparations made in peacetime, he was able to counterattack the enemy in the early stages of the war of resistance. Shanghai was able to support the glorious war of resistance for three months, laying the foundation for victory. General Zhang's planning is truly admirable. Recalling the period of the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the citizens of Shanghai fully supplied and became one with the soldiers. Thinking of this scene today, it is still vivid in my mind. Now that the communist bandits are rebelling and hindering the country's revival, welcoming General Zhang today is truly filled with mixed feelings.

Leading Young People with Special Effort

As for Chiang Ching-kuo, his research abroad and his spirit of service after returning to China are admirable. In particular, the construction of "New Jiangnan," setting an example, and establishing a new atmosphere are well known. Today, everyone is talking about reforming the political and social atmosphere. In addition to Chairman Chiang's leadership, local cadres must work together. Chiang's political achievements in Jiangnan can serve as a model for local politics. In addition, Chiang has made special efforts to lead young people and has a strong interest in doing so. Now that Chiang has taken a position in the central government, he should be able to guide young people under the correct policy, creating cadres with new aspirations to take on the tasks of the second phase of the revolution. The hopes of the country are truly tied to this. The one million young people in Shanghai all have the ambition to serve the country, so they have deep expectations for Chiang. Chiang was ordered to come to Shanghai to guide the merger of the party and the group. Soon, two revolutionary groups with common beliefs, common history, and common leaders will be merged into one to complete the task of nation-building."

Correct and Improve General Atmosphere

After the Chairman's speech, General Zhang Zhizhong was invited to speak amidst enthusiastic applause. He first expressed his gratitude to all sectors of Shanghai and said: "The ancients said, 'Compete for fame in the court, compete for profit in the market.' The people of Shanghai are so busy, it's all for profit. Countries with industries and commerce do not shy away from profit. Shanghai is undoubtedly a big market, and seeking profit is a matter of course. However, the 'profit' sought should benefit the public, benefit the working masses, and, more importantly, benefit the country and the nation. Only then is it a true and legitimate profit. To resist the intrusion of a kind of 'ideology,' each advanced country has its own set of methods. What our country relies on is the Principle of People's Livelihood and modern social policies. After arriving in Shanghai, I have been to theaters, cafes, and dance halls. I have also visited the Tomb of Anonymous Heroes of the Battle of Shanghai and witnessed the lives of the villagers. I deeply feel that the distance between the lifestyles of the people of Shanghai should be shortened, or even eliminated altogether. Shanghai must move forward with the giant wheel of history. Leaders from all walks of life can guide the people, correct and improve the general atmosphere, and make a great contribution to the future of the country."

Call for Development and Construction of the Northwest

Zhang then made a call for the Northwest, saying that compared with the Southeast, Northeast, and Southwest, the Northwest provinces have the weakest foundation, and the people's lives are nearly a century behind the Southeast. He hoped that the Shanghai business community and the national business community could devote a portion of their efforts to developing and building the Northwest. After Zhang finished speaking, Chiang Ching-kuo was invited to speak. His words were very brief and humble, saying that he had made no contribution to the country and was not qualified to be welcomed. Today, he was actually joining all sectors of Shanghai in welcoming General Zhang Zhizhong. However, the kindness and hospitality of all sectors would only encourage him to work harder. Finally, Fang Zhi gave a speech, praising the achievements of Zhang and Chiang. The grand meeting finally ended at 5:45 PM amidst military music.

### Problems with Goods Without Permits: Zhang Jia Requested Instructions in Beijing Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Reliable sources report that the unauthorized plan to handle goods based on the principles agreed upon by the Executive Yuan was subsequently intensified due to the soaring black market exchange rate. Zhang Jiaao, Governor of the Central Bank, went to Beijing yesterday to request instructions on this matter. It is reported that Governor Zhang told representatives of the import and export industry that the principles determined by the Executive Yuan were too unified, while the plan drafted by the Central Bank was too harsh and detailed. He personally advocated a compromise solution, handling goods separately according to their nature, and guaranteeing a solution in the shortest possible time.

### Two Small Planes Arrive in Shanghai After Adventure, Encounter Storm Over Zhejiang, Communications Cut Off, Nearly Lost

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Two Piper Cub-style small airplanes circumnavigating the world safely landed at Longhua Airport in this city at 5:12 PM yesterday afternoon. The two planes were piloted by American pilots Evans and Truman. They took off from the United States on August 10, passed through London, crossed the English Channel, and stopped briefly in the Netherlands before flying to Hong Kong via the Near East route a week ago. Due to unfavorable coastal weather, they stayed in Hong Kong for many days. They ventured to fly north on the 4th of this month and encountered a strong storm after passing Shantou, forcing them to land in Xiamen. During this period, the Guam typhoon landed near Chaozhou and Shantou, and the coastal area was plagued by wind and rain, so they were stranded in Xiamen for three days. However, because the facilities at Xiamen Airport were not good, the two decided to leave Xiamen and come north yesterday when the weather turned clear. They took off from Xiamen at 9:20 AM yesterday morning and arrived over Zhejiang at around 12:00 PM. Unexpectedly, they encountered a strong sea storm and thick clouds again. The two planes lurched left and right, almost losing their direction. At that time, communication with the Shanghai ground was cut off for more than three hours, until around 4:00 PM in the afternoon when they finally escaped the dangerous situation and flew directly to Shanghai. The two planes have abundant fuel reserves, the cabin seats only two people side by side, and the performance of the fuselage is still excellent. According to Evans, the purpose of this trip is to test whether small aircraft can travel long distances, so all driving, communications, repairs and other work during the journey are undertaken by one person. Because their passports still need to be re-signed after arriving in Shanghai, they may delay their departure from Shanghai until tomorrow. It is still undecided whether they will go to the Ryukyu Islands or directly to Tokyo after leaving Shanghai.

The right picture shows the scene when the small plane landed at Longhua Airport, and the propeller is still turning. The two pilots in the picture below are planning the next leg of the journey (photographed by this newspaper)

Wang was arrested at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning and taken to the detention center of the local court for temporary detention.

The prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office expressed disagreement with this verdict because the sentence was too light and applied to the Supreme Court for review yesterday.

### Three Associations Request Reconsideration of Increased Payments for Pre-War Deposits

Regarding the case of increased payments for pre-war bank deposits, it was recently reported that the Executive Yuan's regular meeting approved a maximum repayment of 2,500 times the original amount. Upon hearing this news, the financial community in this city believes that this figure is difficult to bear. On the 7th, the three associations of banks, money shops, and trust companies jointly telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, and the Ministry of Finance, clearly stating the actual difficulties of not being able to bear the burden, earnestly hoping that they would consider the overall situation and reconsider the matter in order to maintain financial stability.

### Shandong Battlefield From Military Victory to Political Competition Two Major Events

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Jinan, Shandong, 5th] Two major events have occurred on the Shandong battlefield in the past half month: one is that the National Army formally recovered Yantai at 9:30 AM on the 1st of this month, and the other is that Chen Yi's remaining main force, unable to withstand the pressure of the National Army, had to abandon its Shandong base area, which it had painstakingly managed for 20 years, and flee south to the border area of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu.

The important position that Yantai occupies in the strategic plans of the communist bandits is known to all. It is the transportation hub between the Shandong communist bandits and the Northeast communist bandits. The Shandong manpower and food, and the Northeast weapons and ammunition, are mainly transported from here. The recovery of Yantai is undoubtedly a failure of the communist bandits' overall strategy and the elimination of the fatal crisis to national unity and construction since the end of the War of Resistance. Its significance far exceeds any previous battle in the country, even the Yan'an battle.

As the "Commander of the Shandong Military Region," Chen Yi, of course, realized this long ago. Therefore, around September 20, he first concentrated two columns that had been transferred north from Jingzhong and completed training in the Yellow River (later increased to four), and together with the remnants of the five columns originally based in southwestern Shandong, launched another large-scale counterattack on Jining City, attempting to occupy the city and then move northeast to the Yimeng Mountain area to contain the flank of the National Army attacking Yantai. However, this was first met with a head-on blow from the National Army's Qiu Qingquan and Wu Huawen troops. After suffering more than 10,000 casualties, the bandit army had to change its plan and flee south across the Longhai Line from Cao County on the 25th and 26th.

Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Border Area

Although the westward fleeing force has joined forces with Liu Bocheng, its plan to ensure Yantai, contain the National Army, and re-enter the Yimeng Mountain area has obviously completely failed.

As of the time this reporter is writing this article, the East China Field Army, commanded by Chen Yi and expanded into 14 columns (including the 1st to 13th columns, missing the 5th column, the Rapid Column, and the Guangdong-Guangxi Column), has seven relatively decent columns that have fled Shandong with Chen Yi. In addition, there are seven columns left in Shandong. Among these seven columns, one Guangdong-Guangxi Column was originally stationed in Huimin, northern Shandong, and has recently moved to Dezhou on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Four other columns are surrounded by the National Army in the narrow area between Changyi, Zuoshan, and Tingkou. The other two columns, after covering Chen Yi's main force fleeing south in southwestern Shandong, have been forced by the National Army to flee north to Liangshan Village, the old nest of Song Jiang. The total strength of these seven columns is only 50,000 people. (Note: Chen Yi's army is organized with each column having a force of 25,000 to 30,000 people.) In addition,

Communist Bandits in Shandong

According to recent surveys: Local teams on the north bank of the Yellow River: Shouzhang has 10,000 people, Acheng has an independent brigade, Liaocheng has 1,000, Renping has 3,000, Qiqing has two regiments between Renping, Zhaihe has two regiments between Yucheng, Huimin has 2,000, Tizikou in northeastern Shandong has 3,000. All logistics equipment in Huimin, originally the supply center for the communist bandits in northern Shandong, has recently begun to be withdrawn. Central Shandong: Qin'an and Laiwu have 1,000, Culaishan has 2,000, Dawenkou East has 1,000, Laiwu Southeast has three regiments, Liuchuan East Dahezhuang has one regiment. Jiangyu West has two regiments, Anqiu Southwest Qinge Village has one regiment, Anqiu Southeast Jingzhi has one regiment. Southern Shandong: Fei County and Xiangcheng have the remnants of three divisions of Zhang Guangzhong's forces lurking between them. North of the Jiaoji Railway and Jiaodong: Zhangqiu East has 500, Boxing and Huantai have 1,000, Huantai Southeast has one regiment, Guangrao South has 1,000, Guangrao Northeast has two regiments, Changyi North has two regiments, Pingdu South has 8,000, Yixian Northeast Zhuqiao Town has one brigade, Gu Xian East has two regiments, Laiyang East has one division, Juchi Yasha has one brigade and two regiments, Haiyang and Weihaiwei each have 2,000, Wendeng has 7,000.

The total number of local teams of the Shandong communists above is four dilapidated divisions, three brigades, 21 regiments, and another 44,500 people. If each regiment is counted as 1,000 people and the dilapidated brigades and divisions are counted as 5,000 people, the total is about 100,000 people. If this number is added to the strength of the seven remaining columns, the total is only 150,000 people. Therefore, compared with the situation at the beginning of this year, when there were 430,000 regular troops and 113 independent regiments (i.e., militia), Shandong will enter a pacification war phase in the future. To achieve the smooth completion of the pacification mission,

The Main Key

Naturally lies not in the military, but in the strengthening of political competition!

By the time this article meets the reader, the part of Shandong south of the Yellow River is likely to have only three counties remaining, (Haiyang, Wendeng, Rongcheng) and one city, (Weihaiwei) also in the hands of the National Army. The northern Shandong part of the north bank of the Yellow River, due to its flat terrain, is ideal for the National Army's mechanized units to move and gallop. In addition, under the "empty city tactics" currently implemented by the communist bandits, the strength of the communist bandits in northern Shandong is only one column of regular troops, one brigade of local troops, four regiments, and 19,000 militiamen. Therefore, after the Jiaodong battle comes to an end, the National Army can not only recover northern Shandong at any time, but also open up the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway at any time. The focus of the current problem is that the National Army's current strategy is still not on the gains and losses of one city or one place, or the opening of one railway, but mainly on concentrating superior forces to capture the main force of the communist bandits, conduct a decisive battle, and give them a destructive blow!

### Yangtze River Vessels Prohibited from Sailing on the North Bank

### Interrogating a Water Monster!

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Wujin, 8th] The county previously had a water monster panic for a time, but the city newspaper exposed the inside story, and the police team's prevention was effective, and the matter was finally put to rest. Unexpectedly, the Zhenchang Danyang Headquarters arrested an unnamed man who did not speak in Menghe. Because he was arrested by the water's edge, he was suspected of being a water monster. After being transferred to the county government for interrogation and transferred to the period, he did not say a word about anything. Everyone thought he was a water monster and spread the word for a while. On the 6th, the county military court brought him for interrogation. He confessed in fluent Cantonese, which was impossible to understand.

He was conscripted and left his hometown, traveled from Guangdong and Guangxi to Shandong. Due to his participation in the war, he was deafened in both ears and was removed from the army. He began to beg along the way. Also, because of the different languages and severe hearing loss, he was called a water monster. His expression was depressed, as if he had unlimited grief. The military court ordered the 3rd District of Menghe, where the case occurred, to investigate the matter within three days.

Taiwan tea is not a high-grade tea, but black tea, due to its good variety and rich color, can fetch US$0.45 per pound in the US export market, accounting for 30% of purchases. Oolong tea, because Taiwan does not have specialized personnel stationed in the US to repackage it into small packages and promote it to three restaurants, the market appears stagnant. Tea companies have more than 2 million pounds of unsold stock from last year, and there are still no customers. This compels the tea industry to move towards the pure production of black tea.

Tea Plantations Throughout the Province

In the past, there were 45,000 jia (each jia is approximately equivalent to 14 mu or more), now there are 38,000 jia. The highest production record during the Japanese occupation was 25 million pounds. The provincial tea company only owns 3,000 jia of tea plantations, of which 2,400 jia have been restored, and 600 jia are still awaiting reclamation. Last year's production was 1 million pounds, and this year it is increasing to approximately 2 million pounds. (The province's total tea production was 6 million pounds last year, with the company accounting for one-sixth; this year's production is 10 million pounds, with the company accounting for one-fifth.) This demonstrates that the private sector in Taiwan tea has an absolute advantage. The government not only does not attempt to control it, but also supports it with practical measures such as loans and fertilizer, turning wasteland into tea country.

Taiwan Tea Company

Has six tea farms, including ten crude processing plants and three refined processing plants, which are the legacy of the Japanese zaibatsu Mitsui in Taiwan. The Japanese used political pressure to deal with tea farmers, designating a certain mountain range or plain and forcing a certain tea farmer to be responsible. The tea farmers were laborers hired by the capitalists, subject to the control and exploitation of the capitalists, and their lives were miserable. After the restoration, the company changed its business model, entrusting all tea plantations to tea farmers and assisting them in cultivating and fertilizing. It then purchased the tea from them at a minimum price of 35 yuan per catty. For five years, the company annually received substandard tea, which was actually insufficient for the company to pay land taxes. However, the tea farmers had to sell their entire crop to the company, which was clearly a loss, but directly encouraged tea farmers to actively increase production.

On the 4th, a reporter took a special car to Sanxia in central Taiwan and visited the tea manufacturing plants and directly interviewed the tea farmers. According to Plant Manager Shen, the plant produced 300,000 pounds last year, but this year it has increased to 900,000 pounds. As long as the tea plantation is expanded and fertilizer is provided, the Japanese record of 1.3 million pounds can be broken within one or two years. In the southern subtropical village, when the reporter interviewed tea farmer Jin Fang, who cultivates 15 jia of tea, he also said that there is hope to expand the tea plantation so that more than half of the 130 households in the village can have the right to inherit the tea fields. (Currently, it is limited to the old tea farmers from the Japanese occupation period). The tea farmers of the Taiwan Tea Company are happy. As long as they are given practical benefits, they are willing to use their blood and sweat to harvest the aroma of tea. No wonder tea experts from Java, when coming to Taiwan to investigate, also praised this method.

Chen Weizhen, the general manager of the tea company, is a hard-working industry researcher. He said that the state-owned, privately-operated tea planting method can achieve the goal of increasing production. The company is now making every effort to increase production and is also inviting experts to conduct special research and exchange technical skills and practical experience with tea farms in the mainland. Accompanying the reporters on the visit were also Vice Admiral Yang Xuancheng, who participated in the Zhushi Conference and the surrender ceremony on the USS Missouri and is currently a consultant to the provincial government. In the future, he will devote himself to the agricultural, forestry, and labor force in Taiwan Province. (Special Correspondent Jiang)

### Simplification of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Registration Procedures in This City - Textile Adjustment Committee Decides - Cotton Allocation by the Executive Yuan Limited to Yarn Factories in Seven Provinces/Cities Including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui

[Reported by this newspaper] The thirteenth regular meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee was held at the committee's conference room yesterday afternoon starting at 4:30 PM. Many committee members attended. Acting Chairman Liú Sìyīng presided. Discussions continued until 7:30 PM. Important resolutions are recorded as follows:

(1) Approved the purchase price of cotton yarn and its grading calculation method.

(2) The originally proposed Shanghai cotton yarn inventory registration method was deemed too cumbersome. It was resolved to entrust three committee members, Gāo Bǐngtài, Wú Wèijīng, and Liú Jìngjī, to simplify it. It would then be submitted to Acting Chairman Liú for approval before implementation.

(3) Approved the "Executive Yuan Cotton Allocation and Yarn Delivery Method." Key points are as follows: The cotton allocation will follow the second allocation method for foreign cotton, based on the number of spindles at the time. After calculation by this committee, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for allocation. Small factories with fewer than 3,000 spindles that can spin 20-count yarn and whose quality meets the committee's inspection standard of Grade D or above will also be allocated cotton. However, each factory must pre-pay a portion of the 20-count yarn to the government as a guarantee. Cotton allocation will be limited to yarn factories in seven provinces/cities: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Tianjin, Qingdao, Taiwan, and Guangzhou. Other regions will no longer be allocated cotton, as raw materials can be sourced locally. Factories that fail to deliver the cotton yarn spun on behalf of others from the first quarter's foreign cotton on schedule will not be allocated cotton by the Executive Yuan this time. Cotton allocation applicants must have guarantees from two yarn factories. Only yarn factories with more than 10,000 spindles are qualified to provide guarantees. All cotton yarn spun on behalf of others by factories must be delivered directly to this committee, then transferred to the National Bank. The yarn delivery period will commence in January of the 37th year and will be completed in three months.

(4) Approved the organizational regulations of the Textile Export Committee. The regulations regarding the committee's tasks are as follows: Approve the quantity and ratio of exported yarn and cloth. Determine the quality standards for exported yarn and cloth. Formulate methods and regulations related to yarn and cloth barter trade. Investigate the export situation of national and private yarn and cloth export organizations. Stipulate the types of imported materials exchanged for exported yarn and cloth and the conditions for exchange. Handle yarn and cloth export procedures. Determine the export price of yarn and cloth. Determine the liability for profits and losses from direct yarn and cloth exports. Allocate funds related to yarn and cloth exports. Investigate foreign markets and yarn and cloth prices, provide reports or suggestions to relevant authorities regarding export policies to be adopted. Other matters related to yarn and cloth exports.

### Frequent Favorable News - Trend of Chinese Stocks Still Uncertain

Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw activity from buyers who took advantage of the National Day holiday. Yǒngshā saw more activity, but other stocks were less impressive. The market was boosted by the upcoming bi-weekly settlement, with buyers attempting to raise prices, leading to a sharp rise. However, the authorities are cracking down on speculation, and many sold at high prices, making it difficult for high prices to be sustained, resulting in a fluctuating market.

Morning Session

Reports stated that Chinese officials had not heard of any news regarding American goods, leading to a rise in prices. After the opening, the exchange rate decreased, and buyers became eager. No. 116, etc., advanced to an immediate delivery price of 308 yuan, with delayed delivery at 318 yuan. No. 8, etc., actively sold.

No. 220, etc., advanced for immediate delivery of Yǒngshā, and No. 32, etc., advanced for delayed delivery of Yǒngshā. Off-exchange interest rates opened low at 2 jiao 1 fen and 2 jiao 5.5 fen. Coupled with the trend in foreign stocks, after 10:30 AM, prices rebounded to around 306 yuan for immediate delivery and 315 yuan for delayed delivery. Police came to cut lines again, and there were reports of arrests of speculators in various markets. Panic set in. No. 40, etc., sold immediate delivery Yǒngshā, and No. 171, etc., actively closed positions. Although No. 103, etc., bought in, mid-session price increases were limited, gradually pushing prices down to a low of 297 yuan for immediate delivery and 307 yuan for delayed delivery. The market closed at 298 yuan and 309 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices for immediate delivery stocks, Yǒngshā, Xìnhé, Huáfēng, Xīngguāng, Jǐngfú, China-France, Xìnyí saw slight increases. Mayar, underwear, matches, Héng were flat. Xinhua, Xīnyà, Jǐnglún, China Silk, Tǒngyì, China Textiles, Róngfēng, and Zháběi decreased. Lì'ān fell by 10%.

### Ladies, Do You Know How to Use Milk Powder to Breastfeed?

— Sū Zēngxiáng

Out of natural love and one's own responsibility, a mother should breastfeed her baby after birth, for at least five months, three months, or even just two weeks. This is because breast milk is suitable for the baby's constitution, clean, easy to digest, nutritious, and resistant to disease. This is a well-recognized fact by many scholars and does not need further elaboration.

However, there are unforeseen circumstances, such as the mother having a serious illness, or a real lack of breast milk and difficulty in finding a good wet nurse. In these cases, artificial nutrition must be used.

If artificial nutrition is used properly, the results can be very good. It is better to use cow's milk or milk powder than to underfeed with insufficient breast milk, leading to a sallow complexion and thinness.

Many people ask me how to mix milk powder. Ladies! Let me tell you, add two liang (approximately 60 cc) of boiled water to each spoonful of milk powder and mix well. This creates a composition similar to fresh cow's milk. This is the basic principle, remember it! Also, canned milk (not condensed milk, condensed milk is not good), also known as Evaporated Milk, take one part milk and an equal amount of water (half and half), which is also the equivalent of fresh cow's milk. Following this principle, you can achieve the same effect whether you use fresh cow's milk, mixed milk powder, or canned milk.

Now let's talk about dosage. To know the dosage, you must first know the baby's weight. From birth until the baby reaches five kilograms (i.e., babies weighing five kilograms or less), the actual amount of milk they need daily (i.e., pure milk) is equal to one-tenth of their weight. For babies over five kilograms, the actual amount of milk they need daily is also equal to one-tenth of their weight. However, for babies weighing five kilograms or less, the milk should be diluted with an equal amount of very thin rice water (also known as "milk-broth"). For babies weighing over five kilograms, the milk should be diluted with one-third very thin rice water (also known as "milk-broth").

For example, if a baby weighs three kilograms (three kilograms, i.e., three thousand grams, equals 6.6 pounds), the daily requirement for pure milk is 300 grams (approximately a little over ten liang), plus 300 grams of very thin rice water, mixed and fed. The total amount of 600 grams should be divided into five to six feedings per day.

For example, if a baby weighs six kilograms (six kilograms, i.e., six thousand grams, equals 13.3 pounds), the milk requirement is still 600 grams. But at this time, the thin rice water added should only be one-third of the milk amount, i.e., 200 grams (i.e., the "milk-broth" mentioned above). 600 plus 200 equals 800 grams (i.e., 800 cc). At this time, the baby is gradually growing, and it is not enough to just drink milk. Therefore, feeding should only be done four times a day, 200 cc each time (between six and a half to seven liang). However, in addition to milk, the baby must be given thicker foods to ensure sufficient nutrition and to prevent the stomach from becoming excessively enlarged by only drinking liquids. This food is called puree. Initially, it should be given once a day, using six liang of milk plus one tablespoon of Cream of Wheat or two tablespoons of Pabeum (available in foreign goods stores). At this time, the child is about three and a half months old.

After four months, give the baby vegetable puree once a day, puree once a day, and milk three times a day. Each puree or other puree (puree is puree) can be given in a small bowl (200 grams), and milk should be given in amounts of six to seven liang each time, no more than that, until six months.

After six months, healthy children can eat pure milk (i.e., fresh cow's milk without water or rice water, or milk powder mixed with two liang of boiled water per tablespoon, both of which are pure milk, as mentioned above). The number of feedings should be gradually reduced and replaced with thicker purees until one year old.

Sugar has a certain amount of calories and also contains powdered carbohydrates. If used in moderation, it can increase weight and promote bowel movements. The old habit of thinking that sugar can produce phlegm is a mistake. The amount of sugar that should be added to ordinary milk is about 5% (five percent). For example, for every one and a half liang of milk and one and a half liang of thin rice water, totaling three liang, one teaspoon of white sugar should be added (one teaspoon equals five grams), and so on. Sugar can only be reduced during diarrhea or excessively loose stools.

The old-fashioned milk cake can be used, but the nutrition is too one-sided and insufficient. If two or three spoons of milk powder can be added during cooking, it can become a nutritious food.

In addition to drinking milk, a small amount of boiled water should also be given daily (starting from birth). Babies who are one month old can eat orange juice, vegetable soup, etc., to increase vitamin C. Babies who are two months old should be given cod liver oil to prevent rickets.

Recent research by American university professors has found that meat juice can be fed to babies as early as two weeks old, which is very helpful for the baby's development. The nutrition of babies must be considered from multiple aspects. Parents should know to improve the diet of babies over one year old who are still only eating milk.

Young ladies! For the sake of the future of the country and the nation, for the sake of your own happiness and joy, I hope you will have a healthy and lively baby. To make it clear to you, I have written repeatedly in detail, hoping you won't say I am too verbose, right?

### The Prognosis and Nursing of Typhoid Patients

— Xie Junshou

(Continued from previous) In cases where underlying conditions like heart disease, lung disease (tuberculosis, pneumonia), diabetes, and nephritis are present, the prognosis is generally poor.

The early onset of bedsores, a rapid and weak pulse, and a significant decrease in white blood cell count also indicate danger.

Regarding the mortality rate of typhoid patients, it is closely related to the environment. The most important factor is the availability of sanitary facilities in the area. If there is a reliable supply of clean water and a well-functioning sewage disposal system, the number of typhoid patients will naturally decrease significantly. Although Berlin, Germany, had a water supply system (i.e., running water) as early as 1856, the number of typhoid deaths did not decrease until a sewage system was implemented in 1875. From that point onwards, the mortality rate gradually declined. Initially, there were 80-85 deaths per 100,000 people. But from 1875-1879, it decreased to 42. By 1900-1902, it was only four. Secondly, wealth is also a factor. Rosemfeld's survey in Vienna showed that the mortality rate in wealthy districts was 16.5-19.74%, while in poor districts it was 24.6-22.19%.

Nursing of Typhoid Patients

Nursing is just as important as medical treatment for typhoid patients. If nursing care is inadequate, it can often lead to serious consequences. Therefore, some people say that nursing typhoid patients is sometimes even more important than the doctor, because there is currently no specific drug for typhoid fever. It is not easy to carefully and safely navigate through this long and dangerous period of one or two months. The following points are now listed in detail:

Quiet: Mental and physical rest is an important condition for typhoid patients. Bed rest can not only prevent intestinal perforation and intestinal bleeding, but also, because typhoid patients have a weakened heart after prolonged fever, movement is very dangerous. The author encountered such an incident last month: a fourteen-year-old boy had typhoid fever, but his temperature was not very high, so the family did not pay much attention to it. At the end of the second week, he went to see a doctor. When they picked him up, the patient felt unable to cope. In an instant, his face turned pale, and his breathing and pulse stopped immediately. By the time the author was called, the patient had already passed away. What was the reason for this? It was due to acute paralysis caused by a weakened heart. There is also a case where the fever has subsided completely, but sudden sitting up causes heart paralysis and death. Therefore, typhoid patients should eat, urinate, and defecate in bed and should not move around.

Diet: The lesion in typhoid patients is in the small intestine, so special attention should be paid to the diet. However, according to our country's customs, typhoid patients are excessively restricted in their diet. There is a saying, "Typhoid is never starved to death," which is also unreasonable. Because the patient has a long-term fever, the body consumes a lot of nutrients. If these are not replenished, the patient will not have enough nutrition, and recovery will be delayed. Historically, people have been very wary of solid foods. In fact, when food reaches the jejunum, it has already become chyme-like and has no stimulating effect. Some people have experimented with solid foods during the feverish stage of typhoid fever and have not seen an increase in relapse or intestinal bleeding. Therefore, although we do not need to advocate solid foods for typhoid patients to avoid accidents, it is important to fully replenish them. It is best to choose easily digestible foods that do not irritate the intestines during the fever period, and to adjust them according to individual preferences. During the fever period, use some rice soup, lotus root flour, fish, eggs, and thick soup made from boiled potatoes and radishes. When the fever subsides, gradually switch to other foods.

Preventing Bedsores: Because patients are bedridden for a long time, they are prone to developing bedsores. Therefore, the bedding should be flat and wrinkle-free. Critically ill patients should lie on air mattresses or water beds, and use ice packs or ice pillows on their heads. Although typhoid patients should lie on their backs, they can often lie on their sides to prevent bedsores. Use air cushions or alcohol to clean the skin in areas that are easily compressed.

The mouth should be kept clean. Wash or gargle with boric acid water three times a day to prevent otitis media and parotitis. For dry lips, apply 1% boric acid honey or boric acid glycerin.

Hair, skin, nails, etc. should be kept clean. Chinese people often neglect the cleanliness of patients, which is a serious mistake, because patients excrete more waste than normal people.

After the fever subsides, patients can sit up after two weeks. If they feel dizzy or uncomfortable, they should be prohibited. Then, gradually stand up and walk.

Mental excitement, long conversations with visitors, and reading should also be prohibited.

During the recovery period, patients should also rest quietly and then engage in work, otherwise, early work may lead to severe neurasthenia.

Supplementation of vitamins A, B, and C is of course also necessary for patients. (End of series)

### Key Points of School Hygiene (1)

— Cheng Hanzhang

For children's physical health, the most important thing is family and school hygiene. Today's educators mostly lack an emphasis on school hygiene facilities. It is not known that if the hygienic foundation of children is not consolidated during the growth period, it will greatly affect their future health. The important points to pay attention to in school hygiene are nothing more than: the completeness of the school's sanitary equipment, especially the cleanliness of the school buildings, the cleanliness of the bodies of children entering school, and the maintenance of cleanliness inside and outside the school. 1. Rest rooms, medical rooms, air baths, open-air classrooms, recuperation homes, shower rooms, and warm bathrooms must be set up in the school. 2. The teaching materials must have the instillation of health knowledge and the method of cultivating health habits. 3. When implementing physical education teaching materials, it is necessary to pay attention to the degree of children's physical strength and weakness, and to apply appropriate teaching materials. Those with weak bodies must not be forced to practice strenuous exercises. 4. The contact between the hygiene of the school and the family is especially important for those with weak bodies. Any shortcomings that need to be corrected as a result of the health check must be notified to their parents or guardians. Special communication is especially important regarding nutrition, sleep, rest, family work, and usual illnesses. 5. Weak children must receive sunbathing, air baths, showers, and warm baths. 6. The application of ultraviolet light treatment, such as the irradiation of artificial sun lamps. 7. The application of cod liver oil and its preparations (vitamin pills and drops) to weak children has a great effect on the nutrition of the body.

(A) Sunbathing

Sunbathing is the most important facility for the care of weak children. The school must be equipped with a special sunbathing room. If it is a simple school or is limited by economy, at least a simple sunbathing area should be set up, such as on the roof playground, etc. A curtain is set up to prevent wind, white cloth is laid on the ground, and black cloth is prepared for parts of the body that need to avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight should not pass through glass, because glass can absorb the ultraviolet light in the sunlight and reduce the effectiveness of sunbathing. Therefore, it is best to choose a square that is directly exposed to the sun. The principles of sunbathing are: 1. Expose the body surface to direct light. 2. Fully utilize sunlight, without any invisible obstacles. 3. Proceed gradually, and do not irradiate the whole body at once.

(B) Irradiation of artificial sun lamps

The effect of sunbathing depends on the effectiveness of the ultraviolet light in the sunlight. However, sunbathing sometimes cannot be implemented due to weather and seasonal conditions. Then, the school authorities should be responsible for arranging for weak children to be sent to large hospitals with complete equipment every week to undergo irradiation by artificial sun lamps. Its effectiveness is the same as sunbathing. The implementation methods are generally the same.

(C) Taking cod liver oil and its preparations

The school must stipulate that cod liver oil or vitamin drops should be distributed to children with weak bodies every week. The doctor must prove it and receive it from the public, and teach the parents how to take it. This has a very effective effect on improving anemia, glandular disease, teeth and overall stunted development, and weak constitution. It is indeed a nutritious and tonic food that cannot be underestimated. However, the distribution procedures should not be troublesome to avoid children abandoning it. Therefore, it must be determined according to the local situation.

### DDT and Prisoner Hygiene

— Hu Qipeng

The insecticidal efficacy of DDT has been widely publicized in writing and adopted by the public for the past two years, and it is already well known to everyone. Its efficacy is particularly remarkable for the eight types of insects that are closely harmful to the body: such as flies, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, and bed bugs. Therefore, it can prevent infectious diseases transmitted by these insects: such as cholera, malaria, typhoid fever, typhus, and relapsing fever. In other words, if DDT is used properly, humans can reduce the threat of many infectious diseases. At the same time, it also saves many prisoners who are imprisoned in prisons, who do not need to be sentenced to death under criminal law, and die unjustly from illness. This is what this article is about.

Prisoners were originally considered to be unworthy of mention by the general public, thinking that there is no need to talk about hygiene for prisoners, and even if they die in prison from illness, it is their own fault and not worth worrying about. It should be known that this is a wrong way of thinking for human beings, and a too cruel inferiority. Therefore, since the 19th century, criminal law has gradually changed from the death penalty and physical punishment to the freedom penalty. The idea is that if a person commits a crime, only his freedom should be deprived, and his life should not be harmed. Therefore, advanced countries attach importance to improving prison hygiene and improving the treatment of prisoners. Recently, the Soviet Union will announce the abolition of the death penalty, which is a further step.

### An Epic History of the 1911 Revolution in the Northwest

— Zhang Liqing

A Prophecy Recorded Regarding the "Fire Station"

A prophesied saying became like a folk rhyme, Indeed, where the station was, the defense disappeared; The bells and drums spared from the chaos were millennia old, Their smeared remaining red compared to the "beautiful watchtower".

The bell and drum towers of Xi'an City, located in the center, are grand architectures, remnants of thousands of years ago. Before the Xinhai Revolution's rise of the restoration army, the police authorities established a "fire brigade". The brigade headquarters was located on the Drum Tower, hanging a sign that read: "Fire Station." Comrade Wu Mu joked to me and others: "If you read these five characters backwards, they become 'Where the station was, the defense disappeared.'" After the revolution, the Manchu garrison in Xi'an was eliminated without a trace, fitting the prophecy. Afterward, the residents all knew this and turned it into a folk rhyme. This is a fact that we witnessed. I don't know why there was a missing character for "brigade" at that time. If there had been the character for "brigade," the inverted reading would not have made sense. The tower has plaques that read "Land of Civil and Military Prosperity" and "Soaring to Heaven," with characters larger than ten feet. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, someone in power painted both the "Bell and Drum Towers" red. The former Ming Dynasty's "Prince of Qin's Palace City," formerly known as the "Imperial City," was also renamed the "Red City." Beware of creating causes!

Comrade Jing Meijiu of Shanxi also has a poem recording this matter, which reads: The ten-foot star conjured a folk rhyme, Before the Double Ninth Festival, the wind and rain surged (Shaanxi's uprising was on the first day of the ninth month); A casual reverse reading became a clever prophecy, Indeed, where the station was, the defense disappeared.

Original note: When Chang'an established the "Fire Station," Wu Mu said to me: It can be read backwards as "Where the station was, the defense disappeared," which was fulfilled during the restoration. Allied Restoration of the old mountains and rivers, ten thousand households in Chang'an

Allied Restoration of the old mountains and rivers, ten thousand households in Chang'an all sang victory; After the secret meeting in front of Xingfu Temple, they went together, generous for a time!

Shaanxi raised the banner of righteousness on the first day of the ninth month of the Xinhai year, being the first to respond to the Wuchang Uprising. Shanxi was on the eighth day of the ninth month, and other provinces and cities were after Shanxi. Looking back on the past and remembering the present, deeply regretting and thinking painfully, how could it not be that the heads and hot blood of the martyrs were easy to come by?

The strength of Shaanxi's uprising was entirely in the hands of the comrades in the New Army. The strategies and doctrines were advocated by the comrades of our Tongmenghui, instilled over several years. The teacher of the comrades of the Shaanxi Tongmenghui was the late Master Zhu Fuguang, who instilled revolutionary ideas after the Gengzi Year (1900). The teacher lectured at the academy, repeatedly explaining the "Revolution" hexagram of the "Book of Changes," "Tang Wu Revolution," the "Revenge" and "Three Ages" theory of the "Gongyang Commentary," the "Great Harmony" chapter of the "Li Yun" in the "Dai Dai Li," and the "People are Supreme" section of Mencius, promoting revolution, opposing the Manchus, and fighting for civil rights. He can be called a pre-eminent enlightened person. Those who went to Japan to join the Chinese Tongmenghui and returned to Shaanxi to carry out the revolution were all students of the teacher. It is true to call the teacher the propagator of the seeds of the Northwest Revolution, a true historical fact.

The people of the Tongmenghui were all upright, frank, sincere, and pure, knowing only obligations. After the restoration, they returned to their fields, initially without any so-called "inducement" or "utilization." May later people learn from this!

The Qing Imperial Palace in Xi'an

After the Western travels and several relocations, the people of Qin still remember the faces of the two emperors; In the blink of an eye, ten years have changed, The revolutionary flowers are red on Longevity Mountain.

During the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi Year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Dezong fled north in panic, and then went to Shanxi and Shaanxi, temporarily using the former Governor's Office as the imperial palace. The following year, the Xinchou Peace Treaty was concluded, and the imperial court returned to the capital. The imperial palace was closed and dared not be inhabited. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the munitions bureau in Dongmutou Market was first used as the headquarters of the commander-in-chief, and then it was moved to the imperial palace to work. The residents habitually called it the "North Courtyard" to distinguish it from the "South Courtyard" of the Governor's Office. From the Xinchou Year to the Xinhai Year, it was exactly ten years, and the transformation of the North Courtyard was like this, so it is specially recorded.

By chance, a pill of Tai Mo was selected for the school, and the capable ministers ultimately possessed talents; The old man of three dynasties inside the "Xinhua Gate," Qian Youcheng in the "Political Affairs Hall."

During the Xinhai Revolution, the Shaanxi Provincial Treasurer, Qian Nengxun, concurrently served as the Acting Governor. On the second day of the ninth month, the revolutionary army attacked the Governor's Office. Qian raised a pistol to commit suicide, but did not hit a vital spot. He was immediately escorted out of the country. When Yuan Shikai usurped power, he changed the State Council to the Political Affairs Hall, with Xu Shichang as the Secretary of State and Qian as the "Right Chancellor." In the seventh year of the Republic, Xu was supported by the Anfu clique to become president, and Xu appointed Qian as the Prime Minister, who can be called a veteran of three dynasties in the Xinhua Gate.

Mourning the Martyrs and Remembering the Comrades

We shared hardships in the Xinhai and Renzi years, How many of the ten people still survive today? I deeply regret the burden of the remaining life, The nine domains are cleared and the souls are summoned again.

The old grass is high and low on the graves, How many heroes have been heard of for several generations? Countless disasters in the past forty years, General Zhang is the Chang'an masterpiece.

Zhang Xiangchu, with the courtesy name Yin Feng, is a native of Chang'an and the leader of the Shaanxi Xinhai Restoration, graduated from the Cavalry Department of the Military Academy. He is still alive today. He lives in Juhuayuan, Xi'an. (The book has not yet been published, so no reprinting is allowed.)

### Sayings of Romain Rolland

— Zhu

It is not only useless but also harmful to increase the already large number of writers merely for the sake of fantasy or vanity.

When writing, be truthful, you should only write what is true, what you expect, what you see, and what you believe.

### The Translation Novel of the Xinhai Revolution How Many Heads Introduction to the Xinhai Revolution Literature Exhibition

How many heads were sacrificed in the Xinhai Revolution? The answer is: "No one can count." The spirit of revolution lies in being able to sacrifice one's own head in order to preserve the heads of the entire nation. At the beginning of the Xinhai Revolution period, the vernacular translation novel "How Many Heads" author wrote: "It is said that there is a great country in Europe called Poland." The content records the tragic history of Poland's subjugation. At that time, the literary novels selected for translation were written in the vernacular style, which is truly an arch in revolutionary literature. The book also contains sayings such as "When the country is about to be subjugated, people are still eating and drinking, singing and playing. Sad, sad! All benevolent comrades in the world, weep together." The author is named "One of the Surviving People of the Subjugated Country," published by Jingjin Bookstore in the thirtieth year of Guangxu. Hu Mieming wrote a poem:

Calamity water floods the sky, and the land is barren; The old pine trees grow in the cold year, The blood and tears of the spirits in the spring stain the earth.

The drama of the copper horse Huang Chao is pitiable, Sad to sacrifice and call to heaven; Do not regard people lightly, Look closely at where the hibiscus is over there.

The long reign of five or six years came to an end, People's hearts are like water flowing east; The unfeeling azure sky is too vast, A red patch on the campfire city wall.

What is the matter for the living to fall into grief, The north and south of the mountains are all spring; Crying for parents in the morning and mourning for children in the evening, The night moon in the third watch is always startling.

The bloodline is now entrusted to ashes, Jackals, wolves, and tigers come together; From now on, there is no interest in life, The imprisoned survivors mourn in the night.

I am a madman, and my words are mad, But I use omens as human articles; A hundred years later, there will be onlookers, Please ask Ping Sha to mourn the wounded.

### The Story Told by the Eaves Rain

— Qingguo

Eaves Rain

Are you moved by the story told by the eaves rain?

But I rudely want to kick the silence of the night with my feet.

In the distance, the gong rang again; it was simply like a standard, piercing the night's net, hitting the target, hitting right next to my ear. Then, a spark suddenly lit up, slowly floating from the end of the black wave, close to my window.

My window is having a cold dream.

In the distance, the stallholder is shouting again;

In the distance, the dog is barking;

In the distance, the voices are jumping and making noise. …

And my window is having a cold dream.

I turned off my light and stared at the window. I seem to have touched a secret of the window. Outside, the rain is getting lighter. But the tune of the eaves rain is even more mournful…

The eaves rain is singing softly;

Where there is song, there will be no loneliness; where there is light, there will be no darkness; where there are flowers, there will be no ugliness;

Lips

Child, your lips are a rose, red,

And mine are two haggard leaves drifting from a distant place. What could be more beautiful than a rose? Your lips are so rosy and tender; inside your lips, you even have a row of teeth that are white and soaked, and a tongue that is red and intoxicating. Child, please cherish your lips! For you, for more people.

Do you know that where there are lips, there is song; where there is song, there will be no loneliness.

Eyes

Do you like to look at other people's eyes?

And your tears are about to well up first.

Remember that familiarity will kill your youth, and passion will damage your reason.

I won't cry. My eyes are two dusty, broken lamps.

The dead ashes of the past buried in the broken lamp plate cannot be excavated by you.

Child, I bless you, your eyes are a lamp flashing with a blazing flame.

Having a lamp flashing with a blazing flame is the most happiness. It is possible to travel the night road.

Child, please cherish your eyes! For you; for more people. Isn't it true that our vast and gloomy land urgently needs lights to light up!

Youth

Do you love flowers? Do you love the flowers blooming on the green plains of spring?

I also love the sun.

Apart from the sun, there is no other flower that never withers.

Youth is the most precious flower.

But the life of youth is too short. Before the sun is red and mature, it falls into the soil like cold morning dew.

Flowers that fall into the soil have no possibility of resurrection.

And youth has no seeds.

Child, please cherish your youth! For you, for more people.

Tell you that this barren field should be decorated with some flowers.

### Random Thoughts in a Shanghai Residence with Preface

— Chen Shuren

I was unable to find a residence in the capital, so I stayed with my relative Xiao in Shanghai. Ten days have passed in an instant. I hastily composed this to record my movements.

I have been in Taiwan Province for more than twenty years, but I did not expect that it would not be easy to live in Chang'an; I laugh at myself for not having the three rabbit holes, but I can still live in a spacious house.

Don't talk about living a simple life, Where in the world can I not be accommodated! Why do I need to have thoughts of Guan, A recluse hidden in the bustling city.

Living in seclusion to preserve my true self, I avoid the soft red dust of this world, The beauty of Huan Lun reaches its peak here, I do not deserve the body of a wandering cloud and wild crane.

The wind does not admire the courage of King Chu, Happiness should be shared with the public; In the bamboo pavilion, under the gauze window, on the rattan table, This wind is not only my clear wind.

Autumn coolness is sent, and the rain has just stopped, Leaning on the railing, I am unable to be sad; Infinitely added to the meaning of good poems, The wind is far and the clouds are cold, about to turn to autumn. (One day before the Beginning of Autumn)

Autumn in Jiangnan is the most pleasant, I plan to arrange happy events frequently; I am happy that Yan Ying is close to the market, I can taste fresh water shield, wormwood, chrysanthemum, and crabs at will. (The Day of the Beginning of Autumn)

Faint sounds of nature are easily submerged, Who else will appreciate the sound? The charming daughter at this time truly understands things, I buy an autumn insect to accompany my clear singing.

I buy fruits and vegetables back from the market, I arrange them in a few piles on the table; Young daughters and grandchildren write and draw around, The artistic wind blows here.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

This is indeed a solution, and undeniably that of a bright and upright hero. Regrettably, Yaoqun's current situation involves a unique difficulty. She and Little Tiger have another mission, and this mission is extremely important. This delay in Tianjin was accidental, merely intended to observe the local situation casually, without any specific task. Therefore, if she gets caught up in this whirlpool, even if she does well, officially, it would only be evaluated as "overstepping bounds and meddling." If she gets herself trapped, she would inevitably be accused of acting wilfully and treating public duties as child's play. Public duties have their defined paths and cannot involve overstepping authority; one cannot act on impulse like a knight-errant in a novel. At most, she can only submit a report of what she has personally seen, which is already considered meddling.

Furthermore, although Yaoqun learned a little about the other party's background from the innkeeper, it was, as the innkeeper said, "somewhat unclear." In other words, the other party remains hidden in the shadows, their true nature unknown, while she is completely exposed without any cover. Knowing oneself but not the enemy puts one at a disadvantage. If a conflict arises, defeat is almost certain, leaving only a slim chance of survival. However, Yaoqun absolutely cannot gamble on that slim chance.

"I am an honest man," the man said, observing that Yaoqun did not respond to his long speech and several questions, and remained very calm; only her finely drawn eyebrows creased slightly, indicating that she found his appearance, rhetoric, and questions novel and amusing; like a spectator appreciating a clown's signature performance on stage; or like unintentionally discovering a rare spectacle—a magpie with two heads—and showing no intention of interrupting, but rather listening attentively, willing to continue listening; so he added the self-promotion "honest man," but then felt that the statement was too weak, so he perked up again:

"Miss Ji, perhaps you think I'm being a bit presumptuous, and I certainly admit I am. But the opportunity is limited, and time does not permit. I can only be presumptuous. I'm truly sorry; a beautiful and graceful woman like Miss Ji certainly won't mind these minor matters… Moreover, the moment you two got off the train, I noticed you:"

Hearing this, Yaoqun suddenly took out a handkerchief, held it to her mouth and nose with both hands, turned away, and sneezed loudly, but immediately returned to her original state, listening quietly.

"...Of the one hundred fifty or sixty men, women, and children on the two passenger cars, only your two travel documents were issued by the Japanese military. At that time, I determined two possibilities: either you were young ladies or young masters from some big shot's family in 'Manchukuo'; or relatives of those newly rich officials from within the country. However, after carefully observing your actions, I immediately overturned both of these assumptions. Why? It's very simple: if you were either of those two types of people, you definitely wouldn't be without fanfare, putting on airs—bringing two maids or servants, getting a car to pick you up. Even if you got off the train halfway, being as young as you two are, wouldn't you be flustered and frantic, acting like spoiled children, putting on a big show, and immediately calling for a small chartered car to run straight to Beiping? Would you be so thrifty and composed?..."

### Revival of the National Soul – Written on the Double Tenth Festival in the 36th Year [of the Republic] –

— Xiao Kangshi

At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Wu Sangui, for the sake of the courtesan Chen Yuanyuan, "cried until the six armies wore mourning, in a rage he charged for a beauty," and let the Qing troops into the Pass, allowing the foreign race to occupy our great land for three hundred years.

During the three hundred years of the Qing Dynasty, although many patriots plotted to restore the "Ming Dynasty," their hearts were not united, and repeated setbacks diminished their efforts. Until Premier Sun "advocated revolution," launching uprisings successively in Pingxiang and Liling, as well as Chaozhou and Huizhou. Advancing from Qinlian to seize Liangyue, they retreated to the Ten Thousand Great Mountains. He then conspired with Huang Xing and others to seize Zhennanguan, fighting for seven days and nights before retreating into Annam. Five years before the founding of the Republic, they again plotted at the Yunnan border, ordering Huang Mingguang to seize Hekou, but failed again due to lack of command. Two years before the Republic, Huang Xing, Hu Hanmin, and others again plotted to launch an uprising with the Guangzhou New Army, but failed again. The following year, on March 29th of the Xinhai year, Huang Xing gathered comrades in Guangzhou to launch an uprising, attacking the governor's office, which became known as the Huanghuagang Uprising. In total, uprisings were launched in various places, no less than dozens of times, lasting for over ten years, all of which failed, and the comrades who were killed by the Qing government included Qiu Jin, Tang Caichang, and the martyrs of Huanghuagang, whose names cannot be fully recorded in the history books.

In the Xinhai year, the Qing government nationalized the national railways, and the gentry and merchants of Sichuan requested the governor to retract the order, but to no avail, and they were arrested and shot by the government, arousing popular anger. The Qing government then sent high officials to Sichuan to investigate and brought the Hubei New Army with them. At that time, most of the New Army were revolutionaries, and when their conspiracy was exposed, dozens of them were killed. On October 10th, the engineering battalion in Wuchang took the lead in launching an uprising, occupying the arsenal. The baggage train outside the city also broke through the gates and entered, jointly attacking the governor's office, and the cavalry and artillery also joined in, unanimously electing the New Army brigade commander Li Yuanhong as the governor of the Hubei Army, and Tang Yuanlong as the civil administrator, calling themselves the "Military Government of the Republic of China."

Li immediately sent troops across the river to occupy Hankou and Hanyang, and the consular corps of various countries declared independence. The Qing government was shocked and reappointed Yuan Shikai as the governor of Huguang, who attacked Hankou and Hanyang, and bombarded Wuchang, and the situation became critical. Fortunately, Hunan had declared independence, and Huang Xing returned to the country, leading the militia of the two lakes in a fierce battle. The provinces responded successively, the navy also revolted against the Qing, and Shanghai and Nanjing were also recovered by the revolutionary army. The Qing government then sent envoys to negotiate peace in Shanghai, changing to a republican system. The Qing government relinquished power, and the revolutionary army overthrew the Qing government, finally achieving success.

In this simple record, we deeply know that after three hundred years under a foreign race, the "October 10th" uprising in the Xinhai year was able to "revive the national soul" entirely, which was certainly not accidental, but was achieved by shedding much "blood of martyrs"! Erecting a "cross" drenched in fresh blood with their heroic spirits!

However, after the founding of the Republic of China, Yuan's dictatorship led to the Second Revolution, followed by the Yunnan Uprising, the failure of Yuan's imperial system, and then the power struggle between the government and the parliament, Zhang Xun's restoration, and warlord separatism. Years of natural and man-made disasters plunged the "revived national soul" into a state of unconsciousness. This was thought to be a symptom of "congenital deficiency" and "acquired imbalance." It was not until the success of the Northern Expedition that the unconscious "national soul" was slightly revived.

However, having been severely ravaged by the warlords in the past few years, rebuilding was difficult, and the Japanese invaders took advantage of the opportunity to advance. The "September 18th Incident" shed blood in Pan Yang, the "January 28th Incident" was the Battle of Shanghai, and finally the "August 13th Incident." After the arduous "Eight-Year War of Resistance," many admirable and moving stories were created.

On this third "National Day Commemoration" since the victory, one cannot help but sigh at the battered and weakened "national soul."

### Revolutionary Grass

— Yun Yao

Chatting with a wartime friend in the evening, we happened to talk about the "revolutionary grass" that was most annoying when working in the occupied areas in the past. Although time has passed and the bad impression it gave me has slowly faded with the passage of time, the mere mention of its name suddenly brings back many memories that seem to be right before my eyes.

"Revolutionary grass" seems to be nowhere to be seen in Shanghai, so I dare to believe that many people are unfamiliar with this old-fashioned name. Now let me give you a brief introduction!

The shape of "revolutionary grass" is very similar to withered grass, with leaves emerging from the end of the stem, slightly triangular in shape, light green in color, and floating on the surface of the water. From a distance, it is easily mistaken for water chestnut grass. Naturally, it also has roots, but they do not attach to the muddy bottom, so before it has become sufficiently prosperous and developed transverse strength, it is like duckweed, carried by the wind. However, its propagation is extremely fast. As long as there are no prolonged strong winds, even if it is only a few scattered plants at first, it can cover the entire river in a week or two. Moreover, it grows very tightly and closely attached to each other, which greatly hinders the passage of ships.

It is said that its seeds were brought from abroad by Empress Dowager Cixi, and its original name was not "revolution." It was because the Kuomintang later launched a revolution and overthrew the Qing Dynasty that it gradually became known as "revolutionary." Some people also speculate that it only existed when the National Revolutionary Army began the Northern Expedition because there was no such grass before, so no one knew its name. Therefore, they adapted to the trend of the times and called it "revolutionary grass." What exactly is it? That can only be determined by botanists, but adapting to the times, it doesn't seem too inappropriate to temporarily call it "revolutionary grass."

However, judging by its name, since it is called "revolutionary grass," then it should also, like the meaning of the word "revolution" that we humans use, have a mission to reform the old, innovate, and transform the environment in the realm of aquatic plants. However, in fact, the process and ultimate result it demonstrates do not match its name, because although other water surface obstacles are driven away or submerged by it wherever it goes, and the appearance of the scenery does indeed have a new look for a time, this is nothing more than a means for it to seize territory and develop its power. The life and convenience of other things are deprived and lost because of its dominance.

During the war, I worked in the occupied areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. Because there were many rivers and streams there, almost all activities relied on boats on the waterways. Therefore, whenever enemy and puppet troops came out to sweep, we often suffered many false alarms of danger and crisis due to the entanglement and obstruction of "revolutionary grass" in the rivers and streams, so at that time, there was no comrade who did not hate it, and they all changed its name to "fatal grass" to express their hatred.

### Reflections on National Day

— Chi Chao

The annual National Day celebration has arrived again. What a happy and joyful day!

Civil servants can rest and not work; teachers can stop lecturing; and ordinary students can freely and happily spend this anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China.

However, the enthusiasm for this commemoration is not as widespread as that for the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Double Ninth Festival. Because the peasants in the countryside only know that the eighth month and fifteenth day of the lunar calendar is the Mid-Autumn Festival, when mooncakes can be eaten, and the ninth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar is the Double Ninth Festival, when Double Ninth cakes are so sweet and delicious, but they don't know anything about the National Day on October 10th. Perhaps this is because our country places too much emphasis on eating, and only when there is something to eat do people know that this day exists.

National Day originally has a long history of blood and tears. Speaking of this history, people are generally tired of listening. This is a story worth commemorating about our founding father, leading his comrades to overthrow the Manchu Qing Dynasty, overthrow autocracy, and establish the Republic of China, creating a bloody revolutionary history.

A most unusual news item was once published in the newspaper, saying: "The Japanese celebrate the anniversary of the Nagasaki atomic bombing." Most people thought it was a ridiculous thing, but I think otherwise. I am not endorsing the actions of the Japanese invaders, but in reality, today's National Day is more like a day of national humiliation, because the blood of the martyrs has faded; the hot blood has cooled; we, the later generations of revolutionaries, are ashamed of the trust placed in us by our predecessors, and we have not yet been able to support the nation-state into a normal state. This is something we should be ashamed of.

The people have high expectations for the government, and this requires us to strive to reform and renew ourselves.

### On the Veto Power

— Pu Lun

The issue of the veto power will be the focus of debate at this United Nations General Assembly, and it is also the key to the success or failure of the General Assembly, and even a difficult problem related to world safety. Because if the veto power is revised or abolished, the Soviet Union and other countries under its influence may angrily withdraw from the United Nations, and the world will once again fall into a state of war.

Since the day the United Nations was founded, for more than two years, it has been plagued by a constitutional issue—the veto power. Now let us talk about it roughly so that readers know what the veto power is.

In the United Nations General Assembly, countries are equal regardless of size, and each person has one vote. Everything is passed with a two-thirds majority vote. Outside the General Assembly, there are also several councils and an International Court of Justice. Among the councils, there is one called the Security Council, which does not manage culture and education, nor does it interfere with economic planning. What it manages is world peace, that is, deciding which country is right and which country is wrong in international disputes, and how to punish or even subdue them. The nature and power of this council actually exceeds the entire United Nations General Assembly.

At the San Francisco Conference, there was a distinction between the so-called inviting countries (China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union) and the invited countries. This means that at the beginning of the organization, there was a distinction between hosts and guests. In the General Assembly, the treatment of hosts and guests is the same. Among the eleven members of the Security Council, five are "hosts," the so-called permanent members, and the other six members are "guests," who are elected every two years. Article 27 stipulates the difference in voting effectiveness between hosts and guests. "Decisions on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members. Decisions on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members, which includes the concurring votes of the permanent members." This means that except for the procedural issues of the Security Council itself, all cases handled must be agreed upon by the five hosts; otherwise, they will not take effect. This is the so-called "veto power." However, there is also a restriction on the "veto power" in the Charter; it divides international events into two types: "situations" and "disputes." For the latter, the country concerned has no right to vote. The people who drafted the Charter inserted this clause, both to give small countries spiritual comfort and to leave a clever plan for the big countries to escape, and at the same time, to provide good topics for sophistical diplomats. The painstaking effort is extreme.

The veto power was originally a special privilege granted to the five powers by the United Nations Charter. Although the reason at the time was to respect the contributions of the five powers in defeating the Axis countries; the main purpose was to maintain the coordination of the five major powers in the joint organization. All resolutions should not fall into unexecutable because any one of the powerful countries is dissatisfied, resulting in the crisis of the United Nations split; although this method is inevitably accommodating to reality, in the current international situation, it must be said that it has its sufficient and necessary reasons. However, because the Soviet Union has abused this power for more than two years (using the veto power as many as eighteen times), it has led to a situation where it is difficult to reach an agreement on everything.

### An Image of a Prominent Woman in Europe: The Queen of Greece

— Jin Sheng

Portrait of Queen of Greece and King Paul of Greece

Greece is currently one of the most unstable countries in Europe, with internal and external troubles and frequent persecutions. The destructive activities of the Communist Party in the north have never stopped. Covertly adding the infighting of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Mediterranean and the Near East, the situation has become increasingly complex.

The Greek royal family lives in this precarious state. The new monarch Paul took the throne not long ago, and all parties do not know him deeply enough, but many people know that his queen is indeed a very outstanding person. People say that Eva Perón has a great influence on the President of Argentina, and some even say that she is the behind-the-scenes manipulator of politics. In fact, the influence of the Queen on King Paul of Greece is similar.

Here, we introduce the queen's origins, demeanor, views, and personality to readers.

The Queen of Greece is the granddaughter of former German Emperor Wilhelm II. She is beautiful and intelligent, with a strong personality and full of courage. She is just over thirty years old, and her social skills are superior. In this troubled country, she has won many friends.

But she is not a person who can sit back and relax. She is diligent in her work and responsible in her duties. Since Greece was liberated from the Nazis, she has returned to her motherland and immediately participated in various relief efforts. She went to remote villages to visit poor people, and it can be said that she went to great lengths. No matter how poor and harsh the surrounding environment was, she was able to deal with it calmly as a queen. She often said with a smile: "I am happy to advise on everything."

What the Queen pays most attention to is work. She has organized many voluntary work service groups, and her enthusiasm has deeply moved King Paul. Once, he said to a group of college students, I am willing to hold a hoe and work with you to repair roads. The college students responded with enthusiastic cheers, claiming that they were willing to sacrifice their lives for Greece. The King did not agree with this statement, but encouraged them in a gentle tone: "This is not enough, you must work for Greece." From this sentence, we can see how deeply the King was influenced by the Queen.

The Queen once loudly appealed: "What Greece needs today is work, organizing voluntary work service groups and organizing more voluntary work service groups. The Queen believes that only work can make guerrillas run out of the mountains and become good citizens of the country. She hopes that the government army will win, but once victory is achieved, she advocates treating the "rebellious" people with a tolerant attitude. She said:

"We can save them; they are just a group of young people without work and leadership. Some of their leaders are certainly bad, but most people are not." From her political views, we can see the breadth of her vision.

The Queen's moving personality sometimes makes enemies her prisoners. Once, she went to visit a hospital, and there were many wounded rebel soldiers being treated there. She stood tall, and with a dignified manner, she ran in and stood in the middle of them, directly asking: "Are you Greeks?" The wounded soldiers said in unison: "Yes." So she continued: "Always remember this sentence, never, ever forget that you are Greeks."

Although the Queen was born in Germany, she deeply loves the natural scenery of Greece, and even believes that the magnificent mountains and forests of Greece are more beautiful and moving than the Swiss Alps. Her love for Greece has won the favor of most Greek people. Her enemies say that her beautiful and moving personality is a danger. In the face of her smile, even enemies will melt like white tower oil.

The current Queen of Greece is such an outstanding person. The strong personality of the Teutonic nation and the political compromise make her increasingly declining in the imperial system. A noteworthy queen.

### Shrimp and Crabs

— Xiao Kangshi

Shrimp and crabs fill the small vegetable market; shrimp are soldiers and crabs are generals; Frost's Descent has not yet arrived and there are so many; no wonder the world is chaotic and you see adulteration and theft! It is commonly said that seeing many shrimp and crabs portends war; this year Frost's Descent has not yet arrived, but crabs are already on the market and plentiful; how can there not be smoke of war everywhere?

Notice: Due to today's crowded manuscript space, "Miss America" will be suspended for one day.

### Shen Bao Relief Hospital Co-Organizes the Ninth Session of Trachoma Prevention and Treatment, Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the Shen Bao's Founding. Quota of 750, Applications Begin on Double Tenth Festival.

The "Trachoma Prevention and Treatment" campaign jointly organized by this newspaper and the Relief Hospital has been going on for more than a year since it started last August. During this period, we have successively held eight sessions of trachoma prevention and treatment, and about 1,500 people have applied for examination and treatment, including teachers, students, workers, business and industrial staff, and civil servants, covering all classes.

We dare not place too high an evaluation on this campaign, nor dare we give it too urgent a hope. Our purpose is only to arouse the attention of Chinese people to the disease of trachoma, and not let it gradually spread unconsciously and become a major disaster for national health.

Trachoma is not as terrible as tuberculosis, nor can it kill people in a short time like cholera and diphtheria. Because of this, people lightly ignore it, so countless people are infected with trachoma, and gradually, it has become a "common disease" of Chinese people. In the past year, we have tried to treat people who have been infected with trachoma, and at the same time helped people who have not suffered from trachoma to prevent the invasion of trachoma. More than 1,000 people have actually cured their trachoma.

Yesterday, we received a letter from the Relief Hospital, agreeing to continue to handle the ninth session of trachoma prevention and treatment with this newspaper, and the quota has been expanded to 750 people to celebrate the 75th anniversary of this newspaper's great commemoration.

For technical reasons, the 750 places will be handled in six months, in other words, each month we can provide free examination and treatment for 125 readers.

Applications will begin on the Double Tenth Festival, with no limit to gender, age, or qualifications. Every reader has the opportunity to be examined and treated for trachoma.

When applying, please prepare an application form, stating your name, gender, age, and occupation, and attach a stamped return envelope with your address clearly written on it for sending the examination certificate. Finally, we must solemnly state that we will not issue examination certificates to applicants who do not meet all the procedures, so that applicants who have completed the procedures can have more opportunities for prevention and treatment.

### Six Chapters of National Day Qitianle (with Preface)

— Ju Zheng

Like a dragon soaring in China, it was almost in the Dinghai year. The lunar month is mid-autumn, and the festival is the Double Tenth. The sound of drums and dances rises, and the whole country is ecstatic. Alas, how grand! Counting our history and tracing the source, the Father of the Nation served as the founding president, submitting a proposal to the National Assembly to designate the day of the Wuchang Uprising, August 19th, as National Day. Proclaiming it both at home and abroad, it shook both ancient and modern times. Thirty-six years have passed, and there has never been enough time, and a special National Day music movement has not yet been prepared. The sounds of Shaowu are not heard, and the laws of Gongshang are disordered. I do not presume to be worthy, so I have taken the old tune of Qitianle, added lyrics to it, and tentatively named it National Day Qitianle. The music score says: Qitianle is a slow sound and belongs to the Huangzhong Palace. Whether or not my clumsy work conforms to the laws of rhythm is known to musicians; I am not familiar with it. Furthermore, the first uprising took place in the city of Wuchang, and the strategic location within the city was fiercely contested for military use. The places where people gathered and resided before the uprising, such as Tanhualin, Yellow Crane Tower, Baobingtang, Huangtupo, Yanzhishan, and Chu Wangtai, are used as themes according to their locations and events, forming six chapters in total, briefly outlining the general ideas, to inspire poetic reflection.

Tanhualin

The Rizhihui, which rose after the Science Tutoring Institute, secretly formed a society in the Anglican Church of Tanhualin. It was influential and honorable, self-sacrificing, and with pure aspirations, making it the most moving story of the seeds of revolution. Therefore, Tanhualin comes first, and all previous planning groups belong to it.

What is the matter with Nan Gong uttering the name of the state of Chu? The prophetic words are left behind in the book. Jie was exiled to Nanchao, and Zhou burned Chaoyi, the wicked taking what they wanted. Blood flowed on the grinding pestle. We pledge to remember the state of Ju, holding high the aspirations of Zhang Chu. The stallion gleams, meeting Yuan Xiangshi in the vastness. The God is about to descend upon Ru. For whom is the Science Tutoring Institute, with a separate unique purpose? Secretly discussing the classics in the pavilion, and performing the history of Tianqu, awakening the enlightened minds. The secret is attached to the red book. Alas, the ploughing ceased in Longshang, and the soldiers were in the army. Joining the League, class by class, can be counted.

Yellow Crane Tower

Jiang Yiwu, Liu Yao, Wang Xianzhang, Wang Shouyu, and others, inspired by Liu Jing'an, Hu Ying, who were in prison, and Zhan Dabei of the Dajiang Bao, invited comrades to join the army and convened a general meeting at the Yellow Crane Tower on New Year's Day of the Xinhai year. In the midst of the drinking and excitement, they pointed to the couplet on the pillars of the Aolue Tower, saying, "The wise men of the past reorganized the universe, and their achievements all started from the Jianghan region." Isn't this Zhang Wenxiang implying that the first uprising by us must be in Wuchang? Therefore, the Yellow Crane Tower comes second, and the Qunzhishe and the Zhenwushe all belong to it.

Wenxiang ascended the Yellow Crane Tower with excitement. His words are pregnant with meaning. Reorganizing the universe, facilitating cultural exchange, all these were the work of our ancestors. The spirit of Jianghan shines brightly, and the snake lurks in the shadows. Vividly, on sunny Qingchuan, comrades enjoy their studies. Zhenwu has never shown weakness. For the coordination of the Qunzhi, there is the same connection. The footprints are like mud, and the chicken feathers are stained with blood, facing this New Year's Day. Sworn promises are repeated. Laughing at the governor holding a skirt, and the superiors entangled. Hats with red flowers are all disgusting.

Baobingtang

When Wenxiang was the governor of Hubei, he selected a beautiful place in the Shueshan Mountain and built a hall, naming it Baobingtang, to escape the summer heat and gather for banquets during his spare time. The local people were also allowed to rest there, creating an elegant cultural atmosphere. At that time, comrades in the camp often gathered here during holidays to discuss the progress of the camp activities, which is worthy of being recorded. Therefore, Baobingtang comes third, and all the representatives of the garrison camps belong to it.

Pei Gong expresses his feelings. Leisurely, he seeks like-minded friends. The dog-butchering from Huai Xu, the snake-charming from Mangdang, those who want to hear Ming Jiao. Calling out, one after the other. Thinking of the revival of the Han people, the overthrow of Qin is necessary. Respectfully, the soldiers are deployed, walking on frost, we shiver from solid ice. The supervisors come to inquire frequently. Do not worry about being discovered, seek shelter in the hall. Documents fly in the army tents, and announcements are made at the gates, with each representative from the camp. Timely promotion. Fearing rumors, and doves and crows on branches. Leaking the spring light, upsetting the superiors.

Huangtupo

Earlier, the Gongjinhui was first formed in Edo, Japan, and I once served as its leader. When I went south, Yang Shijie and Liu Gongsun Wu successively managed affairs. In the Xinhai year, I returned to Wuchang, and Sun found a residence in Huangtupo, assumed the position of Zhang Gongjinhui, and reopened a restaurant with Deng Yulin. Amidst the clutter of cups and plates, the heroic emotions were unconsciously stirred. Therefore, Huangtupo comes fourth, and the engineering, baggage, left and right flags all belong to it. Although the Ming scholars have no peaceful land. The customs of the nation still exist. The three massacres of Jiading and the ten days of Yangzhou await the reading of Mingyi. The sound is like mourning. Furthermore, the history of the mind is passed down like a lamp, and the Green Forest and Water Margin. Various rules and regulations reveal everything about Zhang's ethnicity. Gongjin seeks common salvation. There should be no ambiguity, each is called a shield. Zhu Gui delivers meals, and Hong Niang sends letters, don't say that Sui He has no martial skill. King Wen is angry. Let the forbidden garden play the diao, and the city is full of wind and rain. Grit your teeth, not revealing a trace.

Yanzhishan

Located to the left of the mountain's rear Pacification Office, the Gongjinhui also set up an office here, specifically for contacting students and new recruits. The Mianyang Supervisor of Studies serves as the outer perimeter, making it the most historically interesting among the secret uprisings. Therefore, Yanzhishan comes fifth, and the Lianghu Physical Chemistry and Surveying Special Schools all belong to it.

He Lang suddenly threads the needle. Babbling, starting a new chapter. Rouge from the North, and gold dust from the Southern Dynasties, don't say that this person is not seen. The regret of the common people. It is a young woman knowing sorrow, lingering in the courtyard. The car insects leap, and the sound of autumn often moves with deep resentment. Lianghu has added new relatives. They come in turn, with swords around their waists. Jia's family peeks at the curtain, and the goddess Mi leaves her pillow, with another infatuated sentiment. Burying yourself in the desk. Laughing at the graffiti of the museum, and the love of the swallows in the forest. Taking advantage of going to Liangshan, we are all happy to start.

Chu Wangtai

Located between Tongxiang Gate and Zhonghe Gate, there is an armory. The weapons and ammunition stored there are numerous, and there are often heavy troops stationed there. Until August 18th, the underground organizations in the city were uncovered, and the three martyrs, Peng Chu, Luo Liuyao Cheng, and Yang Hongsheng, were killed. The news was alarming, and everyone was indignant. On the 19th night, impatiently, the fire started at Tangjiao? The engineering began to launch, and comrades from various camps and schools moved out upon hearing the sound, seizing Chu Wangtai in one fell swoop. This action was crucial to the success of the uprising. Therefore, Chu Wangtai comes last, and the South Lake Zhonghe Gate all belong to it.

Peng Gong wrote a confession the other day. The hidden worries of the country are vast. Dongyue Marsh Wu, Nanyang Baluo, all bravely went forward. The soldiers believe in rewards. Now, the young man takes up the knife, and starts to punish the fools. The gentle valley wind blows, and the night orchids do not allow looking back. The fire network of Tangjiao spreads. Towards the predetermined goal, attack the arsenal. The baggage is raised, and the engineering releases arrows, another echo is left. The siege is in the palm of your hand. Happy Wu Sheng won the door, the dragon and elephant of South Lake. Charging into Zhonghe, they rush up with a roar.

### Father of the Nation's Order to Rectify the Officials

After the success of the revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of Provisional President and issued an order to rectify the officials in order to eliminate those who sought advancement through flattery. This order was published in this newspaper at the time. The original text reads:

"At the end of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the officialdom was extremely corrupt. Relatives of the imperial family used profits and emoluments to entice those above, and the scholar-officials used profits and emoluments to trade below. Running around and scheming became the norm, and shamelessness prevailed. As a result, virtuous people were in the wilderness, doing good for themselves, not participating in government affairs, and the people lived in misery. Persisting in their ways without repentance led to their destruction. The Republic of China was established, and everything was renewed. The old city societies were swept away. Rectifying history and governance is a matter that cannot be delayed. However, with laws not yet promulgated and examinations not yet conducted, those seeking advancement harbor intentions of opportunistic theft, and those employing people have the convenience of choosing based on personal preference. If one is not careful, the abuses will be even worse than those of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. The distinction between order and chaos lies in this. Thinking of the future, how can one not be vigilant? At the beginning of the Nanjing government, there were often many people who ran around seeking connections in various places, seeking a position. With this mentality of seeking gain, the habit of deception and falsehood was opened. Some were old officials who pretended to be new talents, or who had just entered school and immediately claimed to have graduated, deceiving and misleading, considering it a skill to get away with it. Although the unified government has been established, and the official offices in this area have been immediately abolished, if unscrupulous people use this as a means of advancement, the lingering harm will be countless. For this reason, I order the ministers and vice ministers of the departments to always carefully investigate and carefully select people when employing them, so that mediocre talents are not allowed to muddle through, and the virtuous and capable are not driven away. This is of utmost importance. Furthermore, it has been found that some recommended officials in various departments hold two positions at the same time, which is not a careful approach to official duties. Those who recommend without knowing are negligent, and those who accept without being forthright are greedy for profit, both are shameless. In the future, except for special circumstances, no one shall hold multiple positions, in order to purify the officialdom and prevent maladministration. This is the order!"

This order from the Father of the Nation fully reveals the abuses of the official arena. Even today, it is still worthy of our vigilance and deep reflection.

### Chongqing and Shanghai: Two Places of Jubilation—Record of the First National Day After Victory

It's the Double Tenth Festival again, the third National Day after the victory.

The nationwide frenzy of celebration two years ago seems to be right before our eyes. In these two years, the domestic political situation and the international situation have undergone great changes. Today, facing the war-torn country and the displaced refugees, we recall the scene two years ago, when we had just won, waving flags and shouting "Celebrate National Day, celebrate victory," we cannot help but feel a myriad of emotions.

However, the more it is like this, the more we miss this day two years ago, the first National Day after the victory, that kind of enthusiastic and crazy situation.

1945 (what an exciting year!) Japan surrendered! A series of victory cries, from August 13th to the Double Tenth Festival, made the people of the whole country hoarse. The Chinese people, who had become accustomed to the Double Tenth Festival during the national crisis, cheered and were encouraged for the motherland's return to light! "The enemy's planes bombed our homes, but they can't destroy our National Day!"

Here, we will first describe Chongqing—representing the various cities, large and small, and villages and towns in the rear; then we will describe Shanghai—representing the occupied areas that had fallen into the hands of the enemy.

In Chongqing

October 10, 1945, in Chongqing.

Early in the morning, the streets were crowded with people. The ferries added extra shifts that day, and the cabins repeatedly spat out passengers entering the city from the South Bank, Jiangbei, Huangjueya, and Haitangxi. The sound of the horns was particularly frequent. The docks of Chaotianmen, Wanglongmen, and Chuqimen were doubly busy. The only street, Minzu Road, was packed with people. The buses, decorated with ribbons, were still squeezing through the crowd. The shop assistants, in groups of three or five, beat drums and walked around the streets. Linsen Road, Zhongshan Road—a scene of rising prosperity, full of infinite vitality.

Wu Guozhen, the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department (now our mayor), gave a speech at the National Day rally held at the Youth Hall in the wartime capital: "China after victory is about to engage in national construction. The citizens of Chongqing should be a model for the people of the whole country. The Party, government, military, and people should unite and work together to carry out national construction. Every citizen, as long as they have confidence in the government and enable the government to fully exert its strength, the prospects for national construction are absolutely optimistic!"

The Youth Corps and the Boy Scouts held an autumn grand review at the Xinyun Square of Fuzi Pond; the US Information Service held a victory photo exhibition at the "Spiritual Fortress"; the students of the drama school rode on parade trains and performed on the streets; three small teams of Kuomintang fighter jets, surrounded by six huge bombers, swept over the city sky, and a stack of colored leaflets flew out of the sky...

The cinemas hung up "Sold Out" signs at eight o'clock in the morning, and the Sichuan opera theater, which was usually deserted, also received special attention. Many places that people were usually tired of visiting suddenly became lovely again, and even the "pickled mustard tuber stir-fried shredded pork" that people were tired of eating tasted unusually delicious. Because the people who had come to the rear from far away from their hometowns had won, returned to their original positions, and would soon be able to go home. Facing this mountain city that was about to be said goodbye to, they could not help but feel reluctant to part.

The newspapers of the mountain city changed from yellow to pink, and special editions were added. They flew out of the hands of the newspaper vendors, flying all over the streets, flying all over the sky... The shops were doing good business; the leaders and famous generals, nine sheets per set, "Celebrate National Day, reduced price sale: President Chiang, Truman, Stalin, Attlee, Roosevelt, Xizhi VI, De Gaulle, Chen Cheng, Eisenhower..." There were countless young men and women who, on this day, completed their "War of Resistance marriages"!

The crowded crowds gathered on the streets until dusk, and the darkness of the night could not cover the excitement in people's hearts. Everywhere there were bright lights, and the V-shaped neon lights evoked a burst of hearty laughter in people's hearts, laughing!

In Shanghai

Laughing, the laughing in the hearts of the people in the recovered areas had a more pleasant and exciting emotion. October 10th in Shanghai was crazy Shanghai.

The racecourse—which once represented the history of imperialist aggression in Shanghai, and had also been used by the enemy puppets to celebrate the construction of the Greater East Asia—was used for the first time by the citizens of Shanghai to celebrate their own country's program. The National Day Commemoration and Victory Celebration Conference was held in the cheers of tens of thousands of people. These participants, starting at 5:00 in the morning, brought bread and dry food and waited in front of the racecourse gate. Before 8:00, the huge racecourse was crowded without any gaps.

The sound of firecrackers was rising and falling before dawn, awakening the citizens of Shanghai from their sleep. After 8:00, tens of thousands of citizens were all out on the streets, standing on the sides of the streets through which the parade passed. Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Lingfei Road, and Albert Road were crowded with people and filled with thunderous cheers. At 9:00 AM, a cannon fired one hundred and one times. The whistles of factories, ships, schools, and temples throughout the city sounded together, and at the same time, the sound of firecrackers was even more incessant. "Shanghai is already a proud Shanghai!"

As Mayor Qian Dajun said in his speech at the celebration meeting! "Now the sun and moon are shining again, the rivers and mountains have been recovered, and the compatriots from all walks of life have escaped the oppression of the enemy puppets and are once again under the protection of the country. The pent-up anger that has been accumulated in the past eight years can be vented as much as possible, and the patriotic feelings that have been hidden in the past eight years can be fully expressed. The joy and delight in our hearts cannot be described in words. Especially today, when we come to this great festival and participate in this grand event, seeing the national flag flying everywhere and hearing the national anthem being sung everywhere, thinking of all the past humiliations that have been swept away and all the shackles that have been abandoned, what we breathe now is completely the air of glory and freedom. We must be joyful and excited, as if drunk and crazy. This kind of mood can be said to be unprecedented in our lives and will never be forgotten!"

After the Youth Corps and the Boy Scouts were reviewed, the victory parade began. More than 500 participating groups, including the National Army, Allied forces, students, civil servants, workers from all walks of life, businessmen, and various organizations, totaling more than 200,000 people, set off from the racecourse amidst the constant playing of marches by more than 30 bands. The Kuomintang flags and the United Nations flags fluttered in the wind, and the various celebration arches along the way were even more magnificent in the midst of the parade of millions of people.

All the major theaters in the city offered half-price tickets to the audience, and it goes without saying that they were crowded. At 11:00 AM, Mayor Qian hosted a banquet at the Municipal Government to entertain distinguished guests from all walks of life at home and abroad. At 4:00 PM, the Third War Area Headquarters held a banquet at the Cathay Hotel to entertain Chinese and foreign guests and air force units. In the evening, the lights of various agencies, shops, and celebration arches shone brightly, dazzling. The citizens were crowded, and the roads were blocked.

The celebration program lasted for three days, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. This was Shanghai's first enthusiastic, exciting National Day that every citizen will always remember in the history of the Republic of China.

Everyone remembers this situation, so there is no need to say more. But the Double Tenth Festival of 1947 has come again, which makes us feel a myriad of emotions. Today, in the face of such a situation, we must find ways to stabilize and unify the country as soon as possible, so that the people can live and work in peace, and then we can celebrate our Double Tenth National Day with great joy. This time will not be far away—perhaps next year.

### The Song Dynasty Also Had a Double Tenth Festival

The name "Double Tenth Festival" was first created by Wu Zhilao, and the article "Historical Tales of the Double Tenth" in last year's National Day special issue of this newspaper once recorded this event. However, according to Chinese history, the name "Double Tenth Festival" already existed as early as the Song Dynasty. Because Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty was born on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, after he ascended the throne, due to the customary taboos of the Dragon Boat Festival, which was a ghost festival, he changed it to October 10th. Wu Zhengchuan, a monk of the Yuan Dynasty, recorded a poem titled "Double Tenth Festival" by the Song Dynasty poet Teng Xiuying in his "Xianglu". The poem says: "The festival meets the Double Tenth, celebrating the tranquility of the heavens, burning incense in the ancient temple to wish the emperor a long life; the ears are in the northern Jin Buddha temple, the eyes are on the southern pole, the star of the old man; thousands of officials are covered with flowers, always in a dark banquet, ten thousand miles of clouds are far away, blocking the court; pine and cypress fill the mountain, I plan for myself, the small minister is also green and green."

### The First Page of the Founding History: A Proclamation of the Wuchang Uprising

After the Revolutionary Army occupied Wuchang, they convened and publicly elected Li Yuanhong as the governor, issued announcements to reassure the people, and sent proclamations throughout the country. The proclamation reads as follows: "On this certain day of a certain month in the 4609th year of the founding of China, the Military Government of the Republic of China proclaims: In the Spring and Autumn period, there was the revenge of nine generations, and in the Minor Odes, there was the righteousness of protecting the state. How much more so when the divine land of China is crawling under the feet of barbarians, and when thieves and monks usurp the master's position, with atrocities pressing from all sides, this is truly an intolerable situation. We descendants of the Yellow Emperor's lineage have enjoyed lasting prosperity for generations, and the virtues and achievements of our ancestors have illuminated the four corners of the world. When the Ming Dynasty encountered misfortune, the Eastern Hu barbarians were not taken seriously. Consequently, they seized our divine artifact and enslaved our Han people for over two hundred and sixty years due to Li Zicheng's rebellion. Wickedness continued, and generations were tyrannical. The imperial court became a place of fleeing swine and deer, and the wilderness echoed with the sighs of jackals and wolves. The barbarians rejoiced, lacking foresight, and taught theft while feigning ignorance, thus opening the door to admit the thieves, and ceding the land of our nation to prolong their fleeting lives. They have borrowed for too long without returning, and compounded their offenses by abandoning principles. This is not only a capital crime of the distant Hu barbarians but also a singular humiliation for the Han people. The Military Government, upholding this great righteousness and surveying our mountains and rivers, is feeding the horses and sharpening the weapons, constantly thinking of expulsion. However, because the overall situation was not yet ripe, we have endured humiliation until now. We have also repeatedly dispatched flanking forces and selected righteous warriors, who have bravely fought to revive the spirit of the Han people. This is why our chivalrous heroes have been repressed for so long. Heaven has deprived them of their spirits, and the hen has lost the morning. The foolish Hu barbarians have dared to assume the throne, causing petty people to advance together, disrupting the court and the countryside, hoarding gold and jade, and treating office as a marketplace. Powerful enemies see this and develop intentions, and the common people look upon it with distress. The barbarians, with their dog-like nature of breaking promises, have again engaged in the deceitful railway nationalization. They are losing power, harming the country, and robbing the people, and the resentment and anger have turned into thunder. From Hubei to Hunan, to Guangdong, to Sichuan, a great wind has risen, sweeping everything away. The collapse is inevitable, and the overflowing flood is imminent. This is truly the time for the Hu barbarians to receive their judgment and for the Han people to revive. The Military Government, overseeing all affairs and respectfully carrying out heavenly punishment, fears that the direction of the army may not be fully understood, causing those who are doubtful and fearful to be universally bewildered, and those in remote areas not to rise up. Therefore, we first announce the benefits of independence to our countrymen, saying: In the past, when the barbarian fortunes were flourishing, it was because they were born wild, skilled at archery and fighting, with fierce eyes and sharp tongues, behaving like jackals and wolves. Therefore, the fierce reputation of the Solun people spread far and wide. When they entered the pass, they promoted their strongmen and occupied key positions everywhere, forcing our people to transport grain and gold, and using these vile creatures to control our Chinese people. After nine generations, they became increasingly licentious and extravagant, relying on cunning and deceit to seize high positions. The court is filled with lifeless bodies, and people have become walking corpses. Therefore, the "Taiping" rebellion contributed to the success of Han traitors. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, the ancestral temples shook. Recently, the situation has become even more precarious. Our ancestral lands have been carved away to the north by Russia and seized to the south by Japan. The imperial court is desolate, and the ministers are carefree. Near relatives are skilled at trading, and high officials grow by selling the country. The roots have been severed, and the branches are in chaos. They are like a horse covered in tiger skin, only having an outward appearance. A kick will bring it down like rotten wood. This is the first reason why the barbarians are bound to fail. In the past, Wu Sangui opened the gates, leading to the fall of the Han dynasty. Fu Quan consolidated the dynasty by relying on Han traitors as assistants. After adopting some Han customs, they engaged in superficial appeasement. At that time, the great trend of the Chinese nation had passed, and righteous men hid in seclusion. Weak and incompetent scholars could not hold their own. They were forced to submit and serve the enemy, gradually becoming tainted with the barbarian ways and forgetting the great righteousness, mingling with the foul and taking the wrong as the right. Petty and greedy men occasionally showed small loyalties, allowing the barbarians to sit high and proudly suck the people's fat for two hundred years. The Han righteous armies repeatedly failed. Even Hong Xiuquan nearly restored the Han land, but Zeng Guofan, Hu Linyi, and Zuo Zongtang, as Han officials, acted perversely and against the tide, allowing the barbarians to be safe again after danger and remain for a long time. This is truly the drunkenness of 'filial grandsons', not the lasting strength of the rebellious barbarians. Now, the great righteousness is becoming clearer every day, and the people yearn for the Han. Eminent scholars and heroic men all revere heaven and love their ancestors, upholding their integrity. Although there are officials who have been tainted by false appointments and have been corrupted by officialdom, they all eagerly seek wealth and profit, are base, arrogant, and vain, and cannot be entrusted with difficult tasks. The barbarians are truly incompetent, and the Han officials are exhausted. Blind men ride blind horses, wandering aimlessly together. This is the second reason why the barbarians are bound to fail. The shifting of nations depends on heroes and is accomplished by the will of the people. Therefore, outstanding men rise up, the atmosphere changes, the people's hearts disintegrate, and chaos arises. In the past ten years, the giants of our race have been beheaded and disemboweled one after another. The people have become accustomed to it and cannot rise up in great numbers. The barbarians have seized the opportunity to maintain their position, delaying until now. They are enacting constitutionalism and changing officials, but they are false and untrustworthy, borrowing money and nationalizing railways, thus further trapping our people. A small spark can start a prairie fire. Between Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong, the common people are running around and shouting, and the valleys echo with their cries. One man raises his arm, and ten thousand follow. The collapsing wave overflows, capsizing the boats. This is the third reason why the barbarians are bound to fail. In the past, our ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, created China and possessed the nine provinces. Tang Yao and Yu Shun inherited the throne, and the Three Kings left their mark, so that culture flourished and was unique in the world. The glorious historical records span over four thousand years. Broad, great, benevolent and kind, the people's virtue has long been established. Compared with Western Europe, it is only slightly inferior in organization. The enlightened people, with their divine and sacred wisdom, should sit high on the earth and mediate in the universe. However, they have sharply declined and lowered their heads, becoming servants to others; disloyal, unfilial, lacking courage to defend their country, and unrighteous in losing their integrity. Hidden virtues and faint light are recalled from ancient times. Looking at our bodies, we feel ashamed. Returning to our true nature will bring clarity, and knowing shame will bring courage. 'Filial piety is inexhaustible and will forever bless your descendants.' This is the first reason why the Han people should flourish. 'When the Great Way prevails, the world belongs to all.' The state has a supreme authority, which is called human rights. Equality and freedom lead to joyful acceptance of destiny. Life is the foundation, law is the boundary, harmony is the virtue, and the people are the measure. One person acting tyrannically is called a 'despot.' King Wu of Zhou set an example by overthrowing him. The Manchus have secretly stolen and become even more arrogant, dividing up the country and stationing troops, living off the common people. High salaries and official positions are all given to their descendants, who flatter and deceive and make arbitrary decisions in the court. They dispose of the country and its rights as they please, restrict our speech, suppress our large gatherings, disturb our neighborhoods, slander our good people, eliminate our talented scholars, seize our people's property, imprison our representatives, and kill our councilors. Heaven and earth are dark, and the people's voices are suppressed. The plains of Muye are vast, and the army of King Wu is glorious. We will restore our freedom and return to our homeland. This is the second reason why the Han people should flourish. The sea is rising, and powerful forces are joining together. Weak countries and small races are treated like dogs and pigs. The people have collective virtues, and the court has heroes. Their power can reach far, and they survive through competition. Although our China is endangered by distant barbarians, the foundations are uneven, and the national strength has been exhausted. The barbarians are even more incompetent. Their fish is rotten, their meat is spoiled, and the stench spreads everywhere. They have attracted enemies to take advantage of the situation. Border areas have been cut off and taken away, and they are attacking our backs and throats, reaching even our ancestral temples. Their snoring arises at our bedside. Our eyes and ears are covered, and our hands and feet are entangled, causing us to lose the depths of our Han land. The spirit of the people is weakened, and we are about to be shattered and devoured by pigs. If we do not remove Qingfu, the troubles of Lu will never end. Purifying and clearing it, and excellent heroes and great men will meet hand in hand. All directions will be solemn, and all enemies will disappear. This is the third reason why the Han people should flourish. We, the fierce and brave men from all directions, the heroes of the world, having understood this righteousness, should each lead ten brothers and rise up at the opportune moment, gather in response, and eliminate all harm, whether great or small, capture the wicked, and present our achievements. We, our uncles, brothers, aunts, and sisters, having understood this righteousness, should pledge our determination, unite in large groups, persevere in our virtue, and exert our strength, advancing to fight and retreating to defend, together with the brave men. You, disloyal scholars and friends, soldiers who have been coerced, you have a body, you are also Han people. Having understood this righteousness, you should repent, quickly do good, always remember your roots, and think of your ancestors. Turn your spears and do not oppose the righteous army, and do not be troublemakers. You Manchus, you are in Han land, you are prisoners. Having understood this righteousness, you should know the will of heaven, return to your tribes, or change your nature and appearance, and be willing to become commoners. Then you will be innocent, and you will be pardoned. The Military Government makes the following agreement with the heroes from all directions: From the state and county level downwards, each should kill the Manchu officials and replace them with elected people, protecting their territory and governing it. Each state and county should also raise an army to share the common hatred and focus on conquest, killing the Manchu officials and cleaning up the provincial capitals, and governing with republicanism. The Military Government will then select generals and soldiers and personally lead six armies to sweep away the court and restore our China and establish the Republic of China. The Military Government also makes the following agreement with the army: All Han people or Manchus who have been coerced, as long as they surrender unconditionally, will be pardoned. Those who gather a crowd with weapons and resist will be killed without mercy! Those who violate military law will be killed without mercy! This is announced to the world as law!"

### A Casual Discussion of National Days of Various Countries

Once a year, it's the Double Tenth again. While celebrating, let's talk about the national days of various countries around the world, based on the materials at hand.

The one that impresses us the most is France's national day. Because before the war, there was a French Concession in Shanghai, the crazy celebration on July 14th must still be remembered by the citizens of Shanghai. At that time, the Gujiazhai Park (now Fuxing Park) had a triumphal archway made of brightly lit electric torches at the entrance, and the park was filled with tricolor flags and red and green electric lights, shining like trees of fire and silver flowers. Small trains, bridges, tunnels, and other children's toys were also set up. The military parade was held domestically. In the concession, from the Bund along Avenue Joffre to Avenue Foch and Route Ferguson, both sides of the road were decorated with red, white, and blue lights and flags. The French Consulate, the French Police Department Fire Brigade, French companies, private residences, and French warships anchored in the Huangpu River were all decorated with lights, starting at nine o'clock on the thirteenth night. It was truly a city that never sleeps, as beautiful as paradise. For several years, there were also lantern parades at night, which were truly lively.

A newspaper from 1937 recorded: "The lantern procession started from the French Concession Police Department at the Grand Clock Tower, passing Avenue Edward VII, Rue Montigny, Rue Ningxing, and Avenue Joffre. First, there were two large red cloth flags with pointed corners, with the white characters 'Grand Clock Tower' written on them. Various colorful paper-made lanterns followed, some rectangular, some cylindrical, all colorful, carried by Annamese girls. A decorated sedan chair with drums was carried by six people, surrounded by a group of musicians playing loudly. Following them was an Annamese man dressed as Jiang Taigong, holding a fishing net and rod, shaking his head and wagging his tail, performing various poses on the road. Then came paper models of cranes, dragon heads, large green frogs, and green-haired turtles, worn by people who crawled on the ground. There were also many armed Frenchmen with shakos and spears following behind to supervise. Firecrackers were set off along the way. At each intersection, the lights and flags formed a large circle, allowing the dragon lanterns, frogs, cranes, turtles, and Jiang Taigong to jump around in the circle. The crowd watching the excitement was very crowded. At half-past nine, a heavy rain suddenly fell, and the lantern parade ended in a disappointing manner." At that time, the crowd watching the excitement truly came from all directions like a tide. The wall of people formed on both sides of the road was several feet thick, so tragedies often occurred in the comedy, such as children getting lost, women being insulted, or pregnant women having their stomachs crushed, which increased the news material in the next day's newspapers.

The British national day is also the royal family's happy event. The most lively one was the coronation ceremony of King George VI in 1937. All British territories around the world celebrated enthusiastically. London, the place where the coronation was held, was of course an unprecedented spectacle. Preparations began three months in advance, costing more than 150,000 pounds. Countries sent representatives to observe. A few days before the ceremony, London was decorated anew. "Flagpoles lined the roads, reaching high into the sky, topped with huge crowns and small flags. Some were decorated as shields, adorned with fresh flowers, and others were decorated with the initials of the king and queen, GE, in colorful splendor. The sidewalks were filled with stands, also adorned with fresh flowers. Curious people from all over the city came to watch, and the crowds were bustling and crowded." On the eve of the coronation, "before it was dark, the crowd had gathered on the road where the parade would pass, preparing to wait all night. Some were old and frail, and others brought tents, preparing to sleep on the street. By midnight, the entire road was filled with four or five rows of people." On the day of the coronation, after the ceremony was completed, the king and queen left Westminster Abbey to return to the palace. "At that time, despite the heavy rain, the crowds on the road were like mountains and seas. Upon seeing the royal carriage, they all cheered loudly, and the cheers lasted for a long time. Tens of thousands of people gathered in front of Buckingham Palace, singing 'God Save the King' and shouting that they wanted to see the king and the little princess. The king, queen, and princess then appeared on the balcony, and the crowd cheered at them. By nine o'clock in the evening, the crowd had not yet dispersed." It is estimated that the crowd watching the coronation parade that day was about two million people. More than 9,000 people felt unwell or were injured in accidents in the crowd, and one elderly man was suffocated to death. Afterwards, the streets where the parade passed were covered with paper scraps, newspapers, glass bottles, orange peels, and so on, and a large number of sanitation workers had to be dispatched to clean them up.

Americans are a young and enthusiastic people, and they always celebrate to the fullest when they are happy, let alone the country's Independence Day. So every year on American Independence Day, we can probably read in the newspapers about many people encountering accidents and dying in the celebrations. This can be said to be "extreme joy turns to sorrow." Last year was the first American Independence Day after the victory, and the celebration of the American community in Shanghai was also very lively. That day, "At 11:00 a.m., Fuzhou Road was bustling with traffic. The Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, hosted officers of the Navy and Army and expatriates on the second floor of the American Club. Hundreds of guests attended, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. At 12:00 noon, Davis read the President's proclamation, and the entire audience unanimously raised their glasses to wish the President good health. From 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., the cruiser USS Los Angeles was open to guests, with flags and decorations, presenting a new look. At 9:00 p.m., naval vessels fired searchlights, and silver snakes danced across the Huangpu River, shining brilliantly. The smoke and fog on the river, illuminated by the strong light, seemed to be covered with a layer of cyan gauze, and the lights repeatedly shone on the majestic buildings along the river, creating a wonderful spectacle with alternating light and dark. The French Club on Avenue Joffre and the Navy and Army Clubs on Nanjing Road and the Racecourse also held grand balls, partying until late at night."

The Soviet Union's celebration of the October Revolution anniversary often had a demonstrative nature, especially in 1940 when the situation in Europe was very tense. According to a TASS news report, the entire nation celebrated enthusiastically, and the streets were packed with people. Workers, employees, cultural figures, and students all held solemn gatherings in their factories and schools. At ten o'clock, the masses entered the Red Square to watch the military parade. When Stalin and others entered the square, the masses greeted them with enthusiastic cheers. At the commemoration, Marshal Timoshenko delivered a speech urging the entire nation to unite and saying, "The Red Army is fully prepared to meet the enemy." Immediately, the troops were inspected for an hour and a half, which was a powerful demonstration of the Red Army's strength. During the inspection, various Soviet aircraft also flew over the Red Square, and armored tanks and new-style cannons made a particularly deep impression. On this day, the Soviet Overseas Chinese General Association in Shanghai initiated and invited Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian expatriates to participate in a dance party, which lasted for five days, and screened the Soviet productions "Mutual Award" and Lenin's film "1918." The Soviet Overseas Chinese Association also invited White Russians from the city to participate, but was rejected. The White Russians all went to the White Russian Church that day to pray, to express their mourning.

The Netherlands in Northern Europe is a kingdom, and Queen Wilhelmina is deeply loved by the people. During the war, the Netherlands suffered greatly from the ravages of war, but now the country has been restored and is being governed in an orderly manner. This year, on February 18, the fourth granddaughter of the queen was born, and the whole country celebrated wildly. A special correspondent for this newspaper wrote: "The traditional historical custom of the Netherlands is that whenever there is a major event in the royal family, they always first use cavalry to gallop and report to the people. On this day, all the cities and towns, big and small, in the entire territory closed for a day, and men and women, old and young, came out of their homes, and you could see the cavalry riding ahead as the vanguard, dignified and majestic. Overall, the celebrations in the cities are similar, and the following points are worth noting: * Automatic military vehicles bearing congratulations to the royal family departed and converged from all directions, with the palace where the queen's granddaughter was born as the final destination. * Flag parades under the clear sky and beautiful sun, * Lively youth marching bands, * Flag-raising speeches and music in the city's squares, * Dances in the streets and alleys in front of the lights, * Church bells ringing in prayer…"

Switzerland, known as the world's park, is located between several powerful countries in Europe, but it has never suffered from the ravages of war in the two world wars. It can truly be said to be a paradise on earth. Switzerland is now celebrating the establishment of the republic, and the national day is on August 1. They are prosperous and wealthy, and the joy of the national day is of course incomparable to other countries. The Swiss have a special custom for celebrating the national day, which is to set off fireworks all over the mountains and fields. From a distance, they look like strings of pearls shining with light. It is said that in the 13th century, when Switzerland was not yet unified, the residents of the three cantons, such as Schwyz, who loved freedom, united to form a confederation, agreeing to use the lighting of beacons as a signal to help each other resist foreign insults. Therefore, Switzerland always sets off fireworks on the national day to commemorate the founders of this federal system. The Swiss love ancient customs very much. On the national day, farmers all over the country wear colorful costumes and parade with percussion instruments, singing and dancing, accompanied by the "ding-ding-dong" sound of cowbells, truly giving people a feeling of "ascending to immortality." And the Swiss are extremely hospitable. Their cheese is famous all over the world. If you are lucky enough to be a guest in Switzerland and happen to encounter the national day, they will definitely treat you to a feast!

### National Day Hair Cutting in Beijing

Beijing held its first National Day celebration, which was extremely solemn, and "Daqingmen" was renamed "Zhonghuamen" to commemorate it. In the afternoon, citizens went to various venues, and the crowds were like mountains and seas, filling the streets. In Liulichang, there were 100,000 people. There were various places for entertainment, the main thing being the performance of new revolutionary dramas. There was also a place where portraits of deceased and living revolutionary heroes were displayed. There was also one thing that could make people laugh, which was that several people gathered outside the city gates, holding scissors to wait. Anyone with a queue had to have it cut off before being allowed to enter the city. Most people remained silent and had their queues cut off. Only a few people angrily fled. Before long, the queues on the ground formed a large pile.

In addition, the people of the whole city were extremely joyful. Both Chinese and foreigners said that they had never seen such unity of purpose. However, the Manchu nobles did not show up, which is worthy of attention. They were deeply afraid that their appearance would arouse jealousy among the Han people, so they dared not appear. This was truly an unnecessary fear. Only Yinchang and Sheng Xuanhuai participated in the ceremony and were treated as honored guests. The people outside the city were all excited, dancing and singing, because of the celebration, while there was no movement in the Forbidden City. The people living in it were no longer noticed by the people, which shows that the city was already lonely and uninhabited.

### Oath of President Yuan to Assume Office as Provisional President

Oath:

The Republic of China is at the beginning of construction, and everything awaits governance. Shikai deeply wishes to exert his abilities, promote the spirit of the Republic, and cleanse away the flaws of autocracy. I will strictly abide by the Constitution and fulfill the wishes of the people, to lead the country to a safe and strong realm, so that the five major ethnic groups can achieve prosperity and happiness together. I will fulfill these aspirations without wavering. After the convocation of the National Assembly and the election of the first President, Shikai will immediately relinquish his office. I sincerely swear to my compatriots.

March 10th of the First Year of the Great Republic of China, Yuan Shikai.

### A Record of Yuan Shikai's Inauguration Oath on Double Tenth

In the Double Tenth Festival of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Yuan Kewen, son of Yuan Shikai, wrote an article entitled "Looking Back on the Double Tenth Festival," published in a certain newspaper in this city. A passage in it described the situation when Yuan Shikai took the oath of office in Beijing in the second year of the Republic of China in great detail, which is transcribed as follows:

"The Double Tenth Festival of the year Gui Chou was the beginning of the Republic's celebration of its founding, and also the day when my late father took office. On that day, it was drizzling, and the cold and gloom were heavy. I attended my late father, riding in a carriage into the Taihe Gate and ascending the Taihe Hall. In the center of the hall, the steps were left vacant, and there was no seat. My late father ascended the steps to take the oath, and the diplomatic corps, councilors, and civil and military officials stood to the left and right of the steps. After my late father took the oath, he went out to Tiananmen Square to review the troops. It was solemn and dignified, with a myriad of aspects. In the years Jia Yin and Yi Mao, when the government was peaceful, it was extremely magnificent. After Bing Chen, the world became increasingly chaotic, and the National Day was inferior year by year. This year's celebration happened to be the twentieth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, which was my late father's birthday. Natural disasters have befallen us, and the scourge of war has resumed. Recalling the past and cherishing the memory, I am deeply grieved! I write a few words to record my sorrow!"

### First National Day in Nanjing

For the first National Day commemoration, all sectors of Nanjing were filled with fervent enthusiasm, especially the military. Since receiving the Governor-General's circular, officers and soldiers alike believed that the establishment of the Republic of China was achieved through the efforts of us soldiers. Therefore, they all willingly donated one-tenth of their salaries to be used as commemorative expenses. In front of the 8th Division Headquarters, two triangular lamp stands made of pine branches were erected, with paper flowers along the edges and national flags and army flags embedded in the center. At night, they shone brightly, resembling a city that never sleeps. The 3rd and 7th Divisions also used pine branches and flowers to build arches in the nearby prosperous streets, adorned with electric lights for a spectacular sight. Consequently, the number of men and women who came to view the spectacle was such that they were jostling shoulder to shoulder.

The Governor-General's Office dispatched personnel to Wan Duo Palace on Zhongzheng Street to prepare various items for the sacrifices to the martyrs. This took as long as two weeks and was quite thorough. The words "崇德" [Cherishing Virtue] were made of flowers at the East Gate, and "報功" [Rewarding Merit] at the West Gate. The screen wall was decorated with five-color electric light flags, dazzling the eyes. Beside it, the four characters "革命紀念" [Revolutionary Commemoration] were made of pine flowers. Inside the main gate, a plaque was embedded with the eight characters "山河奠定，復旦光華" [The Mountains and Rivers are Settled, and the Dawn Shines Brightly]. In the center, there was an altar for the martyrs who died for the Republic of China, surrounded by floral decorations. National flags were flying in the corridors, and national flags or army and navy flags were hung at all doors. At night, when the electric lights were turned on, the scene was especially brilliant.

The evenings of the 9th, 10th, and 11th were the most lively, with all the troops holding lantern parades. Ordinary lanterns were decorated with five-color national flags or inscribed with phrases such as "Revolution Anniversary Commemoration," "Restoration Commemoration," or "Iron-Blooded Nation Building Anniversary Commemoration." Special lanterns included lion lanterns, symbolizing the awakening of China like a sleeping lion. Other various flower lanterns had different names and appearances. Amidst the colorful and bizarre scenes, military songs could be heard from time to time. Whenever they passed the Governor-General's Office or Wanshou Palace, they shouted "Long Live the Commemoration" three times. The 8th Division, 7th Division, and the Mint all set off fireworks, attracting tens of thousands of spectators, truly a rare sight.

On the morning of the 10th, the Governor-General's Office hosted a banquet for consuls from various countries and key personnel from various bureaus and offices, as well as independent battalions and regiments of various troops. In addition, there were over 150 people from the Self-Government Office, political circles, academic circles, and business circles, filling the seats. Governor-General Cheng delivered a speech before the banquet, with extremely humble words, which was met with thunderous applause. At 3 p.m. in the afternoon, Mr. Huang Xing gave a speech on "Revolutionary History" at the First Stage, stating that the establishment of the Republic of China was due to the continuous efforts of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives. Today, as we celebrate this grand event, we should not forget the suffering of the martyrs who died last year and before. From now on, building the republic is the responsibility of those who strive, otherwise, how can we face the spirits of the martyrs in heaven? In the evening, Governor-General Cheng again invited the staff of the Governor-General's Office for a Western-style dinner.

### Li Yadong Becomes an Official, Qin Liming Looks After Horses

After the Wuchang Uprising and the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, some comrades did not fully understand the significance of the revolution, thinking that since the world had been won, they could enjoy being officials. Ju Juesheng, the president of the academy, recorded an anecdote about the party members in his "Meichuan Diary," which is quite interesting. After the success of the revolution, Li Yadong, a party member, was released from prison and appointed to govern Hanyang Prefecture. He immediately bought a blue silk robe and a black mandarin jacket, and every day he sat in a green sedan chair carried by four people, just like the Qing Dynasty prefect's inspection tour. In front, there were flags, umbrellas, and attendants, and gongs were sounded to clear the way, with people shouting and crowding around, a display of great power. Zhang Nanxian saw this and advised him, but he retorted that such a display would let the people know that there was an official. If there were no flags and umbrellas, there would be no dignity. One day, Li went to the Governor-General's Office, still with flags, umbrellas, and a sedan chair, and gongs were sounded to clear the way, but he was stopped by the guards of the Governor-General's Office, who scolded him as a monster from the Qing Dynasty and shouted for him to be beaten. Li was so frightened that his face turned pale and he did not make a sound.

There is another anecdote about Qin Zhen looking after horses, also recorded in the "Meichuan Diary." (Note: Qin was the former Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, who passed away in Shanghai a few months ago.) After Qin was released from prison in Hunan, he went to Wuchang to visit Hu Ying at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Hu spoke to him in an official tone, saying, "Liming, you have come too late. The Ministry does not have any good positions. There is only the Yingwuzhou post station, with two horses that have not been assigned to anyone. The job is also easy. Are you willing to take it?" Qin smiled and left. As a result, the comrades all said, "Qin Zhen looks after horses."

### Chairman's National Day Addresses Over the Past Decade - A Towering Beacon of Victory - Joyfully Celebrating Double Ten Festival - Progress on Every Front

Twenty-Sixth Year:

This year's National Day is the most critical period of hardship and suffering for our country, but it is also the only important period for the revival of our nation.

This war of resistance is a battle for survival from the brink of death, and we must go through extraordinary dangers and hardships to achieve final victory. All compatriots across the country must be truly aware that the initial efforts must be followed by greater courage and sacrifice. We must recognize that this war of resistance cannot be concluded in a short period of one and a half years. We must anticipate that the hardships and difficulties ahead will only intensify day by day. Therefore, we must prepare everything to face a situation that is dozens of times more difficult and arduous than today. Only by establishing the determination to sacrifice to the end can we achieve the goal of national survival.

On this important anniversary, I hope that everyone will be determined to follow the example of the revolutionary martyrs over the past few decades, step on the bloodstains of our soldiers at the front, and rise up together to work hard for the country. The war of resistance will definitely be victorious! The Republic of China will definitely have a bright and splendid future! otherwise, I would rather not receive assistance. The reason for this is that Britain does not want to bear the cost of freight in US dollars in addition to paying for the cost of assistance goods in US dollars, so as to make the international balance of payments more unfavorable. In theory, ocean transportation and international trade are inseparable. The huge amount of imports over the years, both before and after the war, has caused our country to remain in a state of poverty and weakness. Therefore, if we want to develop international trade today, on the one hand, we should encourage the production of export goods, and on the other hand, we should develop transportation and protect the shipping industry.

Although the tonnage of our country's ships is now more than 700,000 tons, given the vastness of our country's territory and the length of our shipping lines, the above-mentioned number of ship tons is certainly not enough for use. Now that the unequal treaties have been lifted and the United Kingdom and the United States are still strangely sympathetic to us, our government should seize this golden age to formulate policies to encourage Chinese people to engage in the shipping industry, and encourage shipbuilding and the establishment of water transport insurance, etc. If this can be done, the country's economic future will not be difficult to improve. Today, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding of Shen Bao and the 75th anniversary of the founding of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, I dare to borrow a corner of the newspaper to make the following four suggestions to the wise government, hoping that our country will become rich and strong and make this a play:

Develop the shipping industry - on the one hand, add large-scale shipyards. During the current transition period, a large number of heavy-tonnage ships that can carry both passengers and goods can be ordered from foreign countries, and the navy can be sent to protect shipping when necessary.

Implement incentives - establish two types of bonuses: shipbuilding and business. For shipbuilding, the government will subsidize a considerable percentage as a bonus. For business, reward the ships and employees with fast, safe, and reliable voyages, and protect their profits.

Control the source of goods - the government has already promulgated several types of materials that are prohibited from being imported. This clear order must be firmly implemented by the customs. The transportation and entry of materials should be ordered by the Executive Yuan to all relevant agencies to use national transportation as much as possible.

Public insurance - ship hull insurance, cargo insurance, and freight insurance cannot be achieved unless the government operates a sound insurance institution to encourage shipping companies and cargo merchants to move forward bravely. Public insurance is not aimed at making profits, but at protecting shipping companies. It is better to operate this business with government credit than to do it privately. In this way, the shipping industry policy can be promoted, so that shipping companies can be fearless, and the shipping industry can make rapid progress. If our government can support the shipping industry to a considerable extent within five years or a certain period, international trade will inevitably shift to a favorable position. If the water transport equipment is strong and there are enough ships, the export of materials such as tung oil, bristles, mineral sand, tea, and firecrackers will not have to rely on foreign ships. Other handicrafts such as porcelain, embroidery, carvings, lacquerware, and medicines have long been welcomed by Westerners, and can all be transported abroad by our own ships to try to gain a market. From this, foreign exchange can be expected to be obtained continuously, and our country can use handicrafts to exchange for industrial machinery and utensils, so that agricultural China can slowly enter the path of industry, and truly rank among the world's powers with the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada.

Twenty-Seventh Year

Now our arduous struggle has been going on for another year. Comparing today's situation with this day last year, we have indeed lost more territory, more heroic soldiers and compatriots have died, and we have suffered more brutal and cruel sacrifices, but there is a very significant difference: this day last year, our compatriots' understanding of the future of the war of resistance was still somewhat vague and hesitant, but now there is a consistent and clear understanding.

Our war of resistance for more than a year has aroused the awakening of national consciousness among men, women, old and young throughout China. In the past fifteen months, countless compatriots have smelted a new national life with hope and a future in the reality of war.

Our Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated revolution all his life. His purpose was to "build the Republic of China and build the Great Harmony." Our victory in the war of resistance will not only make our country successful, but also make a very great contribution to world peace. But on the other hand, our current responsibility is also extremely important. I ask my compatriots across the country to pay special attention to the fact that now is the time of life and death for our China. Our Chinese nation can certainly prove to be free from the worries of being conquered or destroyed. But our struggle today is not only to prevent China from being conquered or destroyed, but to demand national independence and national equality, so that our Chinese nation can live permanently in equality and freedom in the world for generations to come, and achieve the ideal of building a country with great harmony.

Twenty-Eighth Year

To the elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots in the occupied areas and throughout the country: Today is the 28th year of the arduous war of resistance of our Republic of China. Recalling the difficulties of the predecessors in creating the country and looking forward to the bright future of the revolution, I know that all my compatriots across the country must have the enthusiasm to strive forward and catch up, vowing to drive out the enemy and eliminate the traitors, so as to firmly lay the foundation for the independence and equality of our Republic of China. At this meeting of approaching final victory, it will inevitably become more difficult. On this glorious anniversary of the revolution, I would like to sincerely state the following few points to my compatriots:

First, my compatriots must recognize that our country today is a country in the midst of revolution, and our war of resistance is to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete the National Revolution. Revolutionary undertakings throughout history must go through countless dangers and difficulties to achieve success, and there is absolutely no reason to expect luck and quick success. However, once the revolutionary forces are launched, they will never stop until they achieve their goal.

Second, my compatriots should know that the success of the war of resistance in the future does not entirely depend on military advantages, but on how the spirit of common struggle of all compatriots across the country is.

Third, the only key to our victory in the war of resistance today lies in punishing the traitors and destroying the enemy's tools for political offense.

Compatriots! "It is easy to start, but difficult to finish." The great cause of revolution can only move forward and never look back. The great cause of war of resistance can only succeed and never fail.

Twenty-Ninth Year

Looking back on the establishment of our Republic of China, we must unanimously commemorate the Premier Sun Yat-sen, who struggled for the National Revolution all his life. Thanks to the great leadership of our Premier and the generous sacrifice of countless of our martyrs for the country, at this critical moment of the war of resistance and the unprecedented changes in the world, all our loyal soldiers and civilians across the country must uphold the teachings of the Premier and maintain a firm belief to make courageous efforts. If we want to drive out the enemy and complete the unfinished business of the martyrs, we must have the revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit of the martyrs.

Our country is indeed in a time of survival crisis, but today, compared with the environment in which the martyrs of the Xinhai Revolution were in and the environment in which the various countries were in during the revolution and nation-building, we are much better and more successful.

We must maintain our confidence, no matter what the environment. We must work hard when the international situation is favorable, and we must fight to the end even when the international situation is unfavorable to our war of resistance in the process.

The responsibility for the rise and fall of East Asia and the prosperity and decline of the world lies entirely on our generation. This responsibility cannot be avoided. We must stand firm and complete the great and solemn cause of saving the country and the world with the spirit of utmost loyalty, courage, benevolence, and love.

Thirtieth Year

There are two most memorable things in this year: one is that the great righteousness of international peace is clearly visible, and the anti-aggression camp is becoming more and more distinct; the other is that our country has entered a stage of equal international status, and the lifelong wish of the founding father to abolish unequal treaties has been achieved for the first time, which is truly a cause for celebration.

Our national intellectuals and social leaders must face reality squarely, recognize the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, shoulder the great responsibility for the rise and fall of the world, advocate that our compatriots devote themselves to production and science, so as to lay the foundation for national defense, enrich the economy, overcome all difficulties and dangers, and ensure victory.

At this time of revolutionary success and victory in sight, all my compatriots should be especially vigilant, do their best, and work diligently to complete the task.

Thirty-First Year

Our war of resistance is to seek nation-building, and the scale of nation-building must be completed during wartime. There are many aspects to the great cause of nation-building, but in summary, there are only two main ways: diligence and thrift, and realism. Since the New Year of this year, I have repeatedly urged my compatriots to practice wartime living and abide by the National Mobilization Law. However, today's society in general has no active and tense atmosphere, nor does it have a spirit of hard work and sincerity. I have never thought about the suffering of my compatriots in the occupied areas and the hardships of the soldiers at the front, who are frugal and risk their lives. If these bad habits are not fundamentally awakened and thoroughly eradicated, then our nation will inevitably perish without the enemy troops penetrating deep.

It must be known that wartime living is naturally difficult. Compared with the situation of the founding father and the revolutionary martyrs, who were exposed to the wind and rain and lacked food and clothing, we are far more prosperous. What's more, if we want to shoulder the great cause of the nation's revival and building for generations to come, we need to "suffer their minds, starve their bodies, and empty their bodies" to temper our bodies and minds and promote the nation's ambition, so as to be able to assume this important and far-reaching responsibility.

Thirty-Second Year

Compatriots of the military and civilians across the country: Today is the National Day of the 32nd year of the Republic of China. I am honored to take on the heavy responsibility of the National Government today. I feel that the burden is heavy and the responsibility is great.

The establishment of our Republic of China began with the success of the Xinhai Revolution. The rapid success of the Xinhai Revolution set an unprecedented example in world history. This fully proves that the goal of the National Revolution is the common trend of public opinion, and that our revolutionary nation-building and the realization of the Three Principles of the People are in accordance with the will of the people and the times. Although it has gone through many twists and turns, it will eventually succeed. In order to achieve this goal, we should especially promote the people's ambition and concentrate the people's strength. This requires my compatriots across the country to deeply understand the founding father's two last words: "The foundation of the country lies in the people" and "Hundreds of millions of people are connected to the country." Knowing the close relationship between the people and the country, we know that the realization of the Principle of Democracy is the basic work of nation-building. If our Principle of Democracy is fully realized, and 450 million compatriots jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country and the nation, then the progress of our country will be even more limitless. The reason why the democratic politics of the Principle of Democracy is the ultimate goal of politics lies in this.

But we also need to know that the implementation of the Principle of Democracy has its necessary prerequisites. The spirit of democratic politics lies entirely in abiding by the law. If the law and discipline are not observed, then the democratic system will be fundamentally destroyed, and the Republic of China will also be in danger. Therefore, our citizens must understand the true meaning of freedom and the rule of law, and develop the habit of respecting freedom and abiding by the law and discipline, so that democratic politics can have a solid foundation. In any democratic country in the world, the exercise of civil rights and the enjoyment of freedom cannot exceed the scope of the rule of law. No matter how developed civil rights are and how broad freedom is, the statutory track must be consistent from top to bottom and jointly adhered to. All obligations stipulated by law should be actively fulfilled and not evaded. The rights stipulated by law should also be equally shared. Only in this way can democratic politics be truly realized and the Principle of Democracy can be fully completed. In the future, if our Republic of China wants to establish itself in the world, the whole country must develop the habit of abiding by the law, taking the interests of the country as the interests of the individual, and taking the fate of the nation as the fate of the individual, and not evading the responsibilities that should be fulfilled. Government officials must be loyal to their duties, and all the people should also share the responsibility and contribute their abilities. In this way, our citizens can be truly free citizens, and our country can obtain a truly equal position.

Thirty-Third Year

During these thirty-three years, our Republic of China has experienced countless worries and hardships, but ultimately broke through all kinds of dangers because of the sincerity of our compatriots across the country in loving the Republic of China and the determination to protect the Republic of China. Our sacred war of resistance has been going on for more than seven years, and now the final victory is already in sight. I want my compatriots across the country to have a practical review and clear understanding of the status of our country, the situation of the revolution, the current war situation, and the points that we should be vigilant about before the final victory is won.

First, I want to point out to my compatriots that our country today is a country in revolution, and our government and army are a government and army in the revolutionary period, and cannot be criticized and judged by routine. In terms of politics and economy, we are well aware that there are many shortcomings and weaknesses, and we will certainly actively improve and strive for progress. But you must know that there are many shortcomings and weaknesses that any country cannot avoid in the revolutionary period or when the country is at war. Therefore, we must not blame China alone for this, let alone use this as a weapon to criticize and attack the government, and only speak for the enemy and the traitors. Our revolutionary government and people only know how to base themselves on justice and reason in order to achieve their revolutionary goals and realize their Three Principles of the People. In the eyes of the revolutionaries, there is no concept of what is dangerous and what is failure.

Second, I want to point out to my compatriots is China's position in the international community today and our responsibility in the anti-aggression war. Everyone must know that no matter how the world war situation and its strategy change, the East Asian war today cannot be without our China. The future of world safety and peace is also closely related to the success or failure of our Chinese revolution. Because if the East Asian war does not have our staunch and hard-working China, it will not be possible to achieve a complete victory, and if the world peace does not have an independent and free China, there will be no truly realized day. Our country's position and responsibility for the world and mankind have such a significant relationship, so we must love ourselves, respect ourselves, and stand on our own feet and strengthen ourselves.

Thirty-Fourth Year

Today is the first National Day after our Republic of China's victory in the war of resistance. Today, we have finally achieved the goal of final victory, erasing the heavy shame of the past and welcoming the infinite hope of the future. In the future, we should work together and unite in mind and heart to promote the success of nation-building. There is only one goal for the work of our compatriots across the country, and that is "Nation-Building First." Therefore, I will propose three important guidelines related to construction today, and encourage my compatriots across the country to work together.

First, the guiding principle of economic construction - to improve social welfare in order to raise people's living standards.

Second, the guiding principle of cultural construction - to promote scientific research, protect academic freedom, and transform social customs.

Third, the guiding principle of political construction - to popularize the exercise of civil rights in order to consolidate the foundation of constitutional government.

The above three items are the guidelines for future construction, but the fundamental plan lies in the psychological construction and spiritual transformation of the people. Everyone must know that our country lacked a foundation before the war, and was destroyed during the war. We must also know that the world is progressing by leaps and bounds, and the times are constantly moving forward. We must recognize that recovery cannot be restoration, and victory is not rest. We must carry out extraordinary construction on the ruins of war, and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People at the opportunity to rebuild post-war society. We must follow the founding father's teaching of psychological construction that it is easy to know but difficult to act, and boost our nation's inherent spirit of breaking through all difficulties.

Thirty-Fifth Year

Our country has been 35 years since the Xinhai Revolution. The cause of our National Revolution has actually been progressing and advancing during these 35 years, but the distance to the final success of the National Revolution is naturally very far.

On this day last year, I stated that the work in the future is "Nation-Building First." The purpose of our National Revolution is to implement the Three Principles of the People and establish an equal, independent, and free Republic of China. The basic conditions for nation-building are national unity and social stability. If social order cannot be stabilized, then the lives and property of the people cannot be guaranteed, agricultural and industrial production will naturally not develop, and the living standards of the people will not be improved. At the same time, if national unity cannot be consolidated, then internal strife will inevitably occur frequently, the foundation of democracy will naturally not be established, and the cause of nation-building will not be able to begin. Therefore, the current policy of the government is to ensure national unity first, and seek unity through peaceful means. We know that the minimum conditions for national unity are the unity of military orders and political orders. To seek the unity of military orders, we must implement the nationalization of the army and establish a national army. To seek the unity of political orders, the national laws and regulations must be able to be implemented throughout the country and eliminate local separatism. If there are two opposing armies in a country and the local politics form a separatist situation, then it cannot be called a unified country.

Therefore, if we want to strive for peace today, we must consolidate national unity. It can be said that there is no peace in China today without unity, and unity is the only condition for peace. If this condition is denied or destroyed, it will not only prolong the suffering of the people, but will also lead to the country's demise. This is the key to the vital interests and lives of every citizen, and it is also the government's inescapable responsibility. The government cannot ignore the rebellions that hinder unity and attempt to split the country, and the compatriots across the country cannot stand by and watch the disasters that endanger the nation's lifeline and destroy the lives of the people, and put the country and the nation in a place of eternal destruction.

### China's Shipping in the Past Eighty Years

— Xu Xueyu

The Beginning of China's Shipping Industry and Early Competition

Since the beginning of our country's history, water transportation has relied on wooden boats and sailboats. It was not until the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty (1872 in the Western calendar, 75 years ago) that, under the active promotion of Li Hongzhang, then Minister of the Northern Seas, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established. From then on, Chinese people began to operate steamship transportation. During this period, merchants from England, America, France, Russia, Sweden, and Norway successively sailed their steamships into our country's coastal and inland rivers based on treaties (1842) and the Treaty of Tianjin (1858). The Chinese people, feeling that steamships were fast and reliable, were happy to use them. Foreigners profited greatly from this and used their profits to purchase our country's materials and transport them back to their countries. At the same time, our old wooden boats and sampans were gradually eliminated, causing hardship for the people. At that time, patriotic people were deeply worried about this, which was also the reason why Chinese merchants established steamship companies.

In the fourth year of Tongzhi (1865), Zeng Guofan established the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, which was the beginning of Chinese people running their own shipyard. When the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established (1872), the shipyard had already built four merchant ships. However, Song Jin, a cabinet scholar, reported that shipbuilding was too costly and requested that it be stopped. The emperor instructed Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang to make overall plans. Li believed that manufacturing steamships could resist foreign aggression and benefit merchants, so it should not be abolished. He also proposed that after the official ships were completed, they should be leased to merchants for use to benefit shipping and increase the treasury revenue. In the summer of that year, Li Hongzhang ordered Zhu Qiyang to draft steamship regulations. On December 16 of the same year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was officially opened in Shanghai. The iron seal on the office bore the ten characters "General Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company". They first purchased the "Eden" steamship from British merchants and ordered two more ships, "Douglas" and "Li Yun". The earliest routes extended north to Tianjin and Tanggu, south to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, and west to Nagasaki and Kobe, with Shanghai as the center. Since then, under the official-merchant joint system, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships were also used for government errands, operating diligently and striving to improve.

The biggest rivals of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company when it was established were the British company "Taigoo Dockyard and Engineering Company" and the American company "Russell & Company". The "Pacific Mail Steamship Company" was the British "China Navigation Company" established in 1867 (five years earlier than the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company). When the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established, the company's tonnage in China had reached 100,000 tons, also engaged in the transportation of passengers and goods. "Russell & Company" and the Far East manager of the American "Flag Shipping Company" were established in China in 1869. When the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established, the company also owned 60,000 tons of ships and purchased a large amount of property on the wharves along the Yangtze River and in the northern and southern oceans. In addition, "Jardine, Matheson & Co." was the Far East manager of the British "India Steam Navigation Company". It was established in China almost at the same time as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Other companies included the American "Admiral Oriental Line", the British "British India Steam Navigation Company" and "Butterfield & Swire", the French "Messageries Maritimes", the German "Hamburg America Line", and the Swedish "Swedish East Asia Company". They all freely sailed their ships into our country's coastal waters and would occasionally seize any passengers or goods to transport into the Yangtze River. However, the other foreign steamship companies mentioned above did not set up separate offices in China. Therefore, when the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was founded, it was truly like a weak child standing among a group of adults, trying to seize the position of those adults. Taigoo, Russell & Company, and Jardine, Matheson & Co., fearing that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would flourish, repeatedly reduced their fares to attract business after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established. However, those foreign companies were mutually undercutting each other and found it difficult to maintain. Russell & Company, due to falling prices, suffered unsustainable losses and, in the third year of Guangxu (1877), willingly conceded and sold its real estate and ships in Shanghai and other ports to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. From then on, the company's reputation grew stronger, and the British Taigoo Dockyard and Engineering Company became increasingly jealous, further reducing prices to compete. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was once almost unable to maintain itself. Fortunately, Li Hongzhang reorganized and encouraged it, and decreed that all grain tribute from the country must be transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, and reduced and exempted taxes. Only then was the company able to continue operating. Li Hongzhang's efforts to support the operation of shipping by Chinese people at that time can be called the earliest guardian of Chinese shipping, truly a rare enlightened and virtuous talent among the officials of the time. Sheng Xuanhuai, the director-general of the company, devised ways to acquire Russell & Company, purchased ships of all sizes, and personally managed affairs. His achievements were second only to Li.

Under the support of Li, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company devoted all its efforts to compete with foreign shipping companies. By the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu (1900), it had established a solid foundation. In addition to purchasing a large amount of real estate and building warehouses and wharves in various navigable areas across the country, it also owned more than twenty ships of various sizes. At that time, the book assets had reached 9,587,000 taels, which were used to develop the Tangshan, Dongliu, Xuancheng, and Pingxiang coal mines, and invested heavily in the establishment of the Commercial Bank of China (when the bank was established in the twenty-second year of Guangxu, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company invested 800,000 taels, accounting for one-third of the commercial shares at the time).

In the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), Zhang Qian and Zhang Jian established the "Da Da Steamship Company" with a capital of 600,000 taels, establishing its headquarters in Shanghai. It initially purchased one steamship, specializing in navigating the Yangtze River, becoming the second Chinese-established steamship company. Following in its footsteps were: (1) the "Ning Shao Steamship Company", "San Bei Steamship Company", and "Hong An Steamship Company" founded by Yu Hede and others from the Xuan Tong reign to the early years of the Republic. The ships of these three companies sailed on the Yangtze River and in the Shanghai-Ningbo area, with their headquarters all located in Shanghai. (2) The "Zheng Ji Steamship Company", jointly established by Zhang Benzheng and Zhang Bencai, with its headquarters in Yantai. Its routes were Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yingkou, Dalian, and Weihaiwei, making it the largest shipping company in the Northern Seas area at that time. (3) In the Northern Seas area, there was also the "Zhi Dong Steamship Company" founded by Li Xuyuan and the "Northeast Shipping Bureau" run by the three northeastern provinces. (4) In the Yangtze River and South China areas, there were the "Bei Fang Steamship Company" founded by Zheng Xiaosan and the "Da Tong Steamship Company" founded by Lu Bohong. Around the tenth year of the Republic, the establishment of steamship companies sprang up like mushrooms after rain, growing rapidly. The reason for this was partly that the Chinese people did not want funds to flow out and therefore established shipping to compete with foreign merchants. Also, during the First World War, many foreign merchant ships were recalled by their respective governments for use, and our country had not yet joined the war, so there was a large output of materials, urgently needing transportation tools. This caused our country's shipping industry to become increasingly developed.

The Japanese Empire, neighboring our country, seeing that England and the United States had made huge profits from operating shipping in our country, was unwilling to fall behind. In 1907, it established the Japan-Taiwan Steamship Joint-Stock Company, with its headquarters in Tokyo. This company was formed by the Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Rokuto Steamship Company, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and Konan Kisen Kaisha. Since the company was established in the late Qing Dynasty (1907), our country's shipping industry had one more strong rival. (Continued on page 20)

### The Beginning and End of the 1911 Revolution

The Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic, now thirty-six years ago.

Since then, every year on this National Day holiday, there has been a grand commemoration. And there are many written records about the events of the 1911 Revolution. Newspaper articles were news at the time and later became historical material. We have compiled relevant articles published in Shen Bao thirty-six years ago as a commemoration of the 1911 Revolution, to commemorate National Day.

On October 10, 1911, revolutionary party members in Wuchang joined the New Army to launch an uprising. At 9 p.m. on the tenth, the soldiers of the Eighth Engineering Battalion, because they had not received firearms and ammunition, believed that the Qing officials were discriminating against them, and took the opportunity to make noise and start a riot. They clashed with the Manchus, and the two sides exchanged fire for half an hour. Soon, it spread to various battalions. All government offices below the governor-general's office were targeted by artillery shells. The telegraph bureau and the barracks were all burned. Qing Admiral Zhang Biao was about to lead his troops out of the office to command when he was shot and wounded by the New Army. Qing Governor-General of Hubei Rui Cheng hurriedly took refuge on a warship. Wuchang was occupied by the revolutionary army, opening the prelude to the 1911 Revolution.

The revolutionary army originally planned to launch the uprising on October 7, but changed it to the 9th. Unexpectedly, on the 9th, two revolutionary party members were captured in the Russian concession in Hankou. It was discovered that the uprising would take place simultaneously in Wuhan in the middle of the night. The Qing Governor-General of Hubei received a telegram from the Hankou Jianghanguan Customs at about 9 p.m. on the 9th and immediately took precautions, closing the city gates and strictly checking pedestrians. That night, dozens of explosives were found in the Anhui Guild Hall and the Xiangyang Academy in Xiaochao. More than 20 revolutionary party members were arrested. Peng Zefan and two others were executed. This was the blow suffered by the revolutionary party members on the eve of the Wuchang Uprising of the 1911 Revolution.

This was not the first uprising of the revolutionary party members. The Guangzhou Uprising in 1895, the Huizhou Uprising in 1900, the Changping Uprising in 1904, the Anqing Uprising in 1906, the Zhennanguan Uprising and the Huanghuagang Uprising in Guangzhou were all brave and energetic, and the power to arouse people's hearts was not small. However, every time the revolutionary party launched an uprising, it was often discovered by the Qing officials in advance, and each time it failed, many people were arrested and killed. After the failure of the Huanghuagang Uprising, they began to focus all their attention on Wuhan. After being discovered, everyone regretted it.

After the secret agency of the revolutionary party in Wuchang was cracked down, they had to launch the uprising hastily, capturing Wuchang unexpectedly, and it became an unstoppable trend. This was something that everyone did not expect. From a geographical point of view, Wuhan is located in the center of the country, bordering the two provinces of Hunan and Guangdong, which are the base of the revolutionary party, so there is no need to worry about the rear. The people of Sichuan were fighting for the railway and had no intention of immediate change, but the officials acted arbitrarily, recklessly killing people, and the people's resentment was deep. Now that the revolutionary army has captured Wuchang, blocking the path for reinforcements to enter Sichuan, and at the same time, the resentment has erupted, making the situation in Sichuan even more difficult to settle. As for the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the people's hearts have long been lost. Even if they do not immediately launch an uprising, there is no reason to come to help. Therefore, even though the revolutionary army only has the city of Wuchang, the whole country is in a state of turmoil.

The Wuchang Uprising began with the advocacy of the new soldiers, and spread rapidly to various battalions. The artillery guarding the governor's office also tied white cloth and fired inward outside the gate. Before long, a fire broke out in the main office of Wangfu Street, which was close to the governor's office, and the Qing officials were terrified. Rui Cheng and his family disguised themselves and fled. At that time, the artillery and cavalry had rushed in from the Baoan Gate and the Fan Gate, shouting and killing along the way. Fires broke out everywhere, as bright as day. Government offices were either hit by artillery or burned down. Many Manchus were killed, and the police also took off their clothes and hats and fled. After a night of chaos, all government offices were occupied by the revolutionary army. All Qing officials, even those who had not escaped outside the city, were hiding in civilian houses. The troops that had not yet launched the uprising had seen the revolutionary army in Tongxiangmen, Qianjin, and Hanyang, and the sound of gunfire continued from the tenth to the twelfth.

While stabilizing Wuchang, the revolutionary army sent many people to Hankou, occupying Dazhimen. The vagrants in the Hankou Concession, hearing of the Wuchang Uprising, set fires everywhere, which spread rapidly. The revolutionary party members put out the fires and immediately occupied the Chinese界, issuing notices to reassure the people. The Hankou defense army also surrendered. The party members initially planned to occupy the Jiang'an Station in Dazhimen, destroying the railway to prevent the Northern Army from moving south. Just then, the Bian Army arrived with about 12,000 soldiers and fought with the revolutionary party in the Jiang'an Station area. At that time, Hankou still had concessions from various countries, and the revolutionary party did its best to protect foreigners, announcing that they were not allowed to harm foreigners or foreign volunteers. This won the sympathy of various countries, so all countries strictly maintained neutrality.

Hanyang was also occupied by the revolutionary army. The Hanyang Prefect fled, and the Hanyang Arsenal was also acquired by the revolutionary army, obtaining countless military supplies.

The Hanyang Gate When the Revolutionary Army Occupied Wuchang

After the revolutionary party occupied the three towns of Wuhan, they made strict arrangements to resist. Artillery platforms were built on Snake Hill and Turtle Hill in Wuchang to shoot at warships in the river. In Hankou, the railway tracks and bridges were destroyed. Troops were sent to Xinyangguan to resist the Northern Army. At the same time, they restored local order. Local affairs were handed over to the Consultative Bureau. Announcements were made to notify shops to open for business, prohibiting looting and disturbing public order, and protecting foreigners. Wuhan gradually stabilized.

After Rui Cheng took refuge on a warship, he telegraphed Sa Zhenbing, the Qing Navy Minister in Shanghai, ordering him to drive warships to Hankou. Sa Zhenbing led three warships upstream to Hankou and engaged in battle on the Wuhan river. One large warship was sunk by the revolutionary army, and the other two were also damaged. Then, because the consuls of various countries in Hankou said that the concessions were in the line of fire and very dangerous, they declared to the Qing Foreign Ministry, so they retreated downstream. In fact, part of the navy had already joined the revolutionary party, so they all fired into the sky, while the artillery set up by the revolutionary army on Snake Hill and Turtle Hill was aimed very accurately.

Compared with the revolutionary party and the Qing government, the Qing government had two towns and the assistance of various provinces, while the revolutionary party's military strength was less than one town, and the Qing government seemed to have the upper hand. However, the revolutionary army was able to cooperate with one heart and rise up together, while the Qing government's troops, many of whom were new soldiers, had joined the revolutionary party, and those who did not join the revolutionary party did not fight hard when they opened fire. Moreover, the righteous banner in Wuhan was raised, and all sides responded, from Qi and Yan in the far north to Xiang and Bian in the near, and Sichuan, Jiangnan, Liangzhe, Linghai, Yunnan, and Guizhou all showed signs of moving. At the same time, Manchu officials, hearing the news of the revolutionary party, were only afraid of fleeing, abandoning the city as if it were tattered shoes, truly in a state of panic and suspicion. The revolutionary party obeyed Heaven and responded to the times, so it was easy to succeed.

In less than three days, the revolutionary party had occupied the three towns of Wuhan. The news spread to Beijing, and the Qing government was shocked and did not know what to do. It immediately appointed Yinchang, the Minister of the Imperial Guard, to lead the army south to meet with Sa Zhenbing's navy. Later, seeing that the situation was becoming increasingly tense, and there were rumors of independence in various provinces, the people's hearts were lost. The Qing government then reappointed Yuan Shikai as the Governor-General of Huguang and Cen Chunxuan as the Governor-General of Sichuan to win back the people's hearts and stabilize the political situation, but it was too late.

When Yinchang had not yet led the large army south, the revolutionary army had sent troops to Yangzhou, preparing to intercept the Northern Army. On the 17th, the Bian Army met the revolutionary army on the border of Hubei and engaged in a small battle, repelling the Bian Army. At that time, the Bian Army was waiting for Yinchang's reinforcements to arrive, so it did not take the offensive.

By the end of October, Yinchang's first batch of troops had crossed Xinyang and arrived at Wushengguan. The revolutionary army divided its forces to meet the enemy and won a great victory, chasing the Northern Army for more than 50 li and occupying Wushengguan, placing four large cannons at the entrance of the tunnel to block the north-south passage. Soon, Yinchang's main army arrived, and Feng Guozhang's reinforcements also arrived, so the revolutionary army could not support and retreated. On the 28th, Dazhimen and Liujiamiao in Hankou were recaptured by the Northern Army. After Hankou was lost, the revolutionary army retreated to Wuchang. The two armies were locked in a stalemate in Wuhan for a month. By the end of November, Hanyang was also captured by the Northern Army, and Wuchang was also in imminent danger.

The revolutionary army in Wuhan was suppressed by the Northern Army and suffered repeated defeats, but its power was expanding at any time, going up the Yangtze River and entering Sichuan. After the Sichuan Railway Protection Movement, the people's hearts were quite agitated, and most of the New Army in Sichuan inclined to the revolution, so the revolutionary army gained some new strength. The revolutionary party then sent troops south, and Changsha and Yueyang were successively captured. At the same time, they were active in the lower reaches of Changsha, conquering Jiujiang and occupying Anqing, going downstream east. Nanjing was a military stronghold, and Qing Governor Zhang Renjun had mobilized the Jiangfangying Battalion and stationed it in key positions after witnessing the Wuchang Uprising.

On November 8, the New Army failed to attack Yuhuatai and retreated to Zhenjiang. It happened that the Zhejiang reinforcements arrived, so they appointed Xu Shaozhen as the commander of the allied forces and counterattacked Nanjing. On the 23rd, they engaged Zhang Xun's troops and won a victory. On December 2, they occupied Yuhuatai and attacked from Taipingmen. Zhang Renjun and Zhang Xun fled, and Nanjing was restored.

The righteous banner in Wuchang was raised, and all provinces were shaken. The New Army launched uprisings one after another, and the governors of various provinces announced their independence one after another. On the second day of October, the revolutionary army occupied Jiujiang, and Nanchang was shaken. On the 31st, Wu Jiezhang, the commander of the New Army, declared independence, and Qing Governor Ma Rukun committed suicide. On the 24th, Anqing launched an uprising, and Taiyuan and Yunnan also launched uprisings on the 30th. Shanghai launched an uprising on November 3, led by Chen Ying'shi, first occupying the Zhabei Police Station and then the Manufacturing Bureau, and was also restored. The next day, the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Guizhou, Fujian, and Gansu also launched uprisings. There were also frequent rumors of the loss of Tianjin and Baoding. At that time, except for Henan Province, which was a war zone, the other eighteen provinces were all caught in the vortex of the revolutionary army.

Although the Qing government won the military victory in Wuhan, Nanjing was already in the hands of the revolutionary party. Even if Wuhan was restored, it would be of no avail. Moreover, the provinces were declaring independence one after another, the general trend was gone, and there was no way to reverse it. The Qing government then issued an edict blaming itself and dismissed the nobles, ordering Yuan Shikai to form a cabinet. The edict of blaming oneself stated: "I have no way to employ people, and lack the art of governance. I have used relatives and nobles in political places, and I have been separated from the Zhang emperors. I have used Ren in roads, and I have been far away from the people. I have promoted the New Deal, but officials and gentry have taken advantage of it for their own benefit. I have changed the old system, but the powerful people have taken it as a way to do as they please. I have taken too much wealth from the people, but I have not done one thing that benefits the people. I have issued decrees on justice many times, but there is not one person who abides by the law. I have allowed resentment to accumulate below, but I did not know it. Disaster is approaching, but I did not realize it." So, on the one hand, they negotiated peace and, on the other hand, they proceeded to organize a provisional government. On January 1 of the following year, the provisional government was established. On February 12, the Qing Emperor issued an abdication edict. The 1911 Revolution was completed.

The 1911 Revolution, from the Wuchang Uprising on October 10 to the Qing Emperor issuing the abdication edict, lasted only 126 days. The speed of events was unprecedented in the history of revolutions. This was due to the incompetence of the Qing officials and the corruption of the court, which led to the loss of the people's hearts. However, without the repeated and spectacular sacrifices, there would have been no such speed.

### Study of the Name of the Country and the National Seal

During the abdication of the Qing Dynasty and the peace talks between the North and the South, there were many conflicting opinions on the official name of the new country after the revolution, such as "Republic of China", "Great Republic of China", "Great Han State", "Great Han Republic", etc. Later, the senators were established and formally designated the title "Republic of China" as law. Zhang Taiyan, a master of national studies and a senior revolutionary, strongly advocated using the name "Republic of China". At that time, he wrote an article "Explanation of the Republic of China" in the Min Bao, extensively citing many reasons.

Regarding the national seal, it is no longer possible to know who engraved the first national seal. However, the national seal used by today's National Government was engraved by the Father of the Nation when he was the Grand Marshal in Guangzhou. This national seal is made of old pit jade, with the words "Seal of the Republic of China". It is 2.7 inches high and 2.6 inches square. It was engraved by Lu, a famous jade craftsman at the time, who was paid 8,000 yuan. Tong Shenghai, the secretary of the Marshal's Mansion, was appointed as the Seal Official to manage the affairs.

### Record of the Recovery of Shanghai

The success of the Xinhai Revolution hinged critically on the recovery of Shanghai.

If we were to examine the revolutionary history of the founding of the Republic of China, this principle would become very clear. The Wuchang Uprising took place on the evening of October 10, 1911. The recovery of Shanghai occurred on November 3 of the same year—twenty-four days after the Wuchang Uprising. Shanghai was originally the central hub for planning the revolution, as well as the linchpin of north-south sea and land transportation, and a vital passage for domestic and foreign communications. Apart from occupying extremely important positions in politics, culture, education, economy, finance, industry, and commerce, it was also a military hotspot. After the revolutionary army recovered Shanghai, they could obtain various conveniences in terms of military supplies and funding. Moreover, the recovery of Shanghai was launched before the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang took action. At this time, the three towns of Wuhan were re-occupied by the Qing army, so the headquarters commanding the revolution had already moved from Wuhan to Shanghai. Subsequently, the launch of volunteer armies in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the capture of Nanjing, and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China were all planned from Shanghai. Therefore, the recovery of Shanghai occupies an extremely glorious and important page in the history of the Xinhai Revolution.

Today, taking advantage of this Double Tenth Festival in the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, we would like to present a systematic narrative of the entire process of Shanghai's recovery.

Leader – Chen Yingshi

When the Qing government’s policies were deteriorating day by day, and foreign troubles arose one after another, the tide of revolutionary thought was just beginning to sprout, and Shanghai was already the center for advocating revolution. This was because Shanghai had concessions where freedom of speech was relatively unrestricted. Patriotic societies run by figures such as Zhang Taiyan and Cai Yuanpei, and the Restoration Society run by Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin, were all advocating anti-Manchuism at the time, showing their sharp edges and having a great influence on the people, especially students and other intellectuals. Although there were considerable setbacks in the process, such as the "Subao" case, which was a rather famous major imprisonment in the history of the revolution.

These heroic and moving deeds would take a long time to tell, and we do not want to recount them again here. Here, we will only recount the events directly related to the recovery of Shanghai.

We should start by mentioning Chen Yingshi – he was the leader of the recovery of Shanghai and also a great figure in the founding history of the Republic of China.

Chen Yingshi, whose given name was Qimei, was a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang. Six years before the founding of the Republic, he joined the Tongmenghui in Tokyo and later entered the Dongbin School to study military science. Three years before the founding of the Republic, he returned to China from Japan and began to work on party affairs in Shanghai. He once gathered comrades to found the "China Daily" and the "Minsheng Congbao" in Shanghai as revolutionary organs of speech. He also established a secret office in Defuli, Mahe Road. Revolutionary comrades from Jiangsu and Zhejiang who came to Shanghai mostly stayed there to connect with each other.

The following year, the party affairs flourished. Chen convened comrades from Jiangsu and Zhejiang at the office to discuss major plans. Unexpectedly, Liu Guanghan, a revolutionary party member present, betrayed everyone by secretly informing Qing official Duanfang, who notified the concession authorities and searched the Defuli office. Chen escaped because he was out. Chu Fucheng, Zhou Danyu, and others escaped disguised as workers. Only Zhang Gong was arrested by the authorities and imprisoned in Nanjing Prison. Due to this incident, the major plans of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were interrupted.

Central China Alliance

In June 1910, the year before the Xinhai Revolution, comrades of the Tongmenghui in Japan gathered to discuss the expansion of revolutionary work. Song Jiaoren suggested organizing the "Central China Alliance" to promote revolutionary work in the provinces along the Yangtze River. Song then came to Shanghai to plan and proceed with comrades such as Chen Yingshi. By mid-February of the following year (the year of Xinhai), the "Central China Alliance" gradually became organized. On the sixth day of the sixth lunar month of the intercalary month, the inaugural meeting of the "Central China Alliance" was held at the Zeng Hall in Huzhou. A total of thirty-three comrades attended, and Song Jiaoren, Chen Yingshi, Tan Renfeng, and others were publicly elected to preside over party affairs. It was decided that the eight provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi would jointly launch uprisings, with each province proceeding separately.

After the establishment of the "Central China Alliance," the key hub was Shanghai. In mid-September of that year, military comrades from Hubei Province ordered Ju Zheng and others to go to Shanghai to discuss the procurement of hand-drawn drawings and other military supplies, and planned to invite Song Jiaoren, Huang Xing, and others to go to Hankou to take charge of everything. Ju Zheng and others arrived in Shanghai and held a meeting at Chen Yingshi's secret office on Mahe Road, deciding to launch uprisings in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan simultaneously, and sent personnel to Hong Kong to invite Huang Keqiang to Hankou to preside over the events. However, before the arrangements were completed, revolutionary comrades in Hubei Province, unable to wait any longer, raised their flags in Wuchang – which was the famous Wuchang Uprising of today thirty-six years ago. Thus, Huang Keqiang, Song Jiaoren, Ju Zheng, and others rushed from Shanghai to Hubei to jointly manage military affairs. Chen Yingshi and others stayed in Shanghai to contact defense forces in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou to launch uprisings in response.

"September 13" Uprising

After the Wuchang Uprising, the people of Shanghai were extremely excited. The following short story can illustrate the sentiment of the people at that time:

Because people in Shanghai were concerned about the actions of the Wuchang rebel army, our newspaper specially issued an afternoon edition at that time to report the news about the revolutionary uprising to readers as soon as possible. Once, the newspaper received a telegram from a reporter reporting that Feng Guozhang had retaken Hanyang from Hankou. This was, of course, unfavorable news for the people's army and was included in the afternoon edition. Unexpectedly, just as the news vendors were shouting and selling it outside the newspaper office, a large group of righteous people swarmed into the newspaper office, accusing them of spreading rumors. They were happy when the people's army won, and angry when the people's army lost, even blaming the newspaper office. Such popular sentiment was already a sign of the revolution's success.

The revolutionaries in Shanghai at this time believed that the time was ripe and prepared for an uprising. On the one hand, the Shanghai Merchant Corps, organized by Shanghai merchants themselves, also rose up in response and maintained close contact with the people's army. On the eleventh day of the ninth lunar month (November 1), the Merchant Corps held a grand review at Nine-Acre Field, with more than two thousand people participating. The presidents of the various merchant corps held a meeting at the Nanshi Fire Brigade, chaired by Li Pingshu (whose bronze statue is now built in the Lake Heart Pavilion of the City God Temple for admiration). It was agreed that if the bell tower of the Fire Brigade rang, first nine times, then thirteen times, the Merchant Corps would be dispatched in sections for defense, implicitly meaning responding to the revolution on the thirteenth day of the ninth month. On the evening of the 12th, Shanghai Taoist Liu Xiangsun had already obtained this information and was so anxious that he didn't know what to do, and quickly telegraphed Nanjing Governor's Office, reporting the Shanghai Revolutionary Party uprising and the complete defection of the Merchant Corps. So at dawn on the 13th, Nanjing Governor's Office ordered the Nanjing and Songjiang troops to advance directly to Shanghai, and ordered "Regardless of the people's army or the Merchant Corps, those captured will be executed immediately."

At this time, the people's army and the Merchant Corps were in a situation where "the arrow was on the string and had to be fired." In the afternoon, the Zhabei police took the lead in launching the uprising. At 5 o'clock, the people's army, with white cloth wrapped around their arms, in military attire, and carrying guns, marched into the city, posted announcements to reassure the people, and at 10 o'clock at night, attacked the Daoxian Office. Shanghai Taoist Liu Xiangsun had already fled into the concession, and County Magistrate Tian Farong had also left. White flags were hung everywhere in the city, and shops operated as usual. At this moment, the Fire Brigade alarm bell rang loudly, and the Merchant Corps knew that the situation had matured, and the entire body went out to defend, and the Shanghai County town was so peacefully and without bloodshed, entered into the hands of the people's army.

At the same time, Chen Yingshi, because he had already successfully contacted a part of the defense army of the manufacturing bureau, led the daredevil team of the people's army to attack. Unexpectedly, another part of the defense army in the bureau came out to firmly resist. Chen ordered to stop the attack temporarily, and personally ran into the manufacturing bureau to give speeches and persuade the resisting soldiers. Who knew he was captured and locked to a pillar with iron chains. The people's army immediately began a fierce attack, and the Merchant Corps also sent two teams of merchants to assist, and sent people into the bureau to persuade the defense forces to act as internal agents. As expected, internal agents privately unloaded the cannon door and sent it out. The attack reached Daming and finally occupied the entire bureau, rescuing Chen Yingshi from danger; and Shanghai was completely recovered.

Bloody Battle of the Manufacturing Bureau

Regarding the attack on the manufacturing bureau, our newspaper at that time had extremely detailed records. Here is an excerpt from our newspaper news on September 14 of the Xinhai year:

Special events in this port: Yesterday at 5 o'clock, the revolutionary army obtained the Shanghai military camp, attacked the manufacturing bureau at 5:15, and occupied Shanghai city at 8 o'clock. The people were not disturbed at all. Earlier, at 3 o'clock, more than two hundred Republic soldiers lined up and passed through the Shanghai military camp. The soldiers on both sides raised their hands to their foreheads as a salute. Before long, the Republic army flag was raised in the camp. "After the Republic army arrived at the manufacturing bureau, there were 120 daredevils who rushed in first, wearing white uniforms with red money inlaid on the sleeves, without military weapons, and attacked barehanded. First, the leader of the daredevils set off a bomb inside the door, which was very loud. Then the people's army gave speeches to the crowd, saying that they were all compatriots and would not harm them. It is hoped that they will not refuse, and that Zhang has agreed to give it up, etc. However, the artillery battalion and patrol police stationed in the bureau came out to resist and fired a volley of guns. The people's army was unprepared and suffered eight gunshots. The leader of the daredevils injured his arm when releasing the bomb and has been sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is heard that many defense soldiers were also injured. At this time, the people's army knew that it could not be reasoned, so they used their death power to attack and surrounded the bureau. Then retreated to Wangdao Bridge and planned to attack slowly." The record in our newspaper on the 14th can only go this far due to time constraints. The next morning, the front page of our newspaper had a continuation of the attack on the manufacturing bureau;

"... At dawn, the people's army returned to the manufacturing bureau, with more than 200 daredevils and hundreds of Shanghai military camp soldiers, divided into two teams, attacking the front and rear doors. Those attacking the front door were forced to the second door. The soldiers guarding the building fired guns from the first floor, and bullets fell like rain. The people's army went forward bravely and also fired guns upwards to resist. About two hours. The people's army intended not to hurt people, so they did not bring many bullets. At this time, the bullets were running out, but the bureau soldiers continued to fire their guns. The daredevils rushed to the Shanghai military camp and dragged two Gatling cannons, fired more than ten rounds, and one bullet was blasted towards the roof. The bureau soldiers still refused to retreat, and the people's army said that they would take kerosene to burn the building, so the bureau soldiers began to fear and fled. At that time, the people's army attacking the back door could not enter because there was no way in. The Shanghai military camp fired a volley of guns and blasted a hole in the back wall, and then entered. The daredevils first threw bombs and the Shanghai military camp soldiers fired guns afterwards, which was extremely brave. The bureau soldiers saw that the attack was coming from both sides, and knew that they could not resist, so they surrendered to the army. It is heard that the military supplies in the bureau are extremely sufficient, and the people's army is very happy. ..."

In this bloody battle, our newspaper also commented on the "Battle of the Shanghai South Manufacturing Bureau" in the editorial on the 15th, deeply praising the revolutionary party's selfless spirit.

In fact, this bloody battle fully demonstrated the courage and spirit of the revolutionaries. When the people's army was running out of bullets and dying, but everyone had no intention of retreating, they finally succeeded with the last five minutes of perseverance. How could it be a fluke? A young student who participated in the revolution had been shot in the head, his face was covered in blood, but he still disregarded himself, tore off his clothes to bandage the wound, carried a gun and shouted, and rushed forward. How could this spirit be matched by even a fraction by the current generation of people who are greedy for life and afraid of death!

After the Recovery

The situation of the revolutionary army entering Shanghai has been mentioned roughly above, and here we will record it in more detail:

I might as well copy the old newspaper again: —— (our newspaper on September 14 of the Xinhai year)

"Yesterday at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, there were forty or fifty Republic soldiers, in military uniform and with swords, lined up and entered Xiaodongmen, and hung an announcement on the telegraph poles at each city gate and Changsheng Bridge, and the patrol police did not dare to stop them. The text is recorded below: According to the Wuchang Uprising, all compatriots are of one mind. Wherever my flag points, everyone is welcome to welcome them. The people of all provinces and cities have recovered and have never harmed Anning. Shanghai is a giant port in the southeast, famous in the trading world. Once the army gathers, the damage will inevitably be light. Now, by order of the military government, I, together with people from all walks of life, have pledged allegiance to the enemy's heart and compassion. I hope that all dear compatriots will continue to live and work in peace and stability, and do not take advantage of this opportunity to infringe on the lives and property of foreigners. In an instant, the Republic of China will be established, and everyone will share peace.

At 8 o'clock in the evening, another team of the Republic army, about twenty people, carrying guns, lined up and entered the city, holding red and white flags of the Republic army, and posted announcements in all directions. White flags and military flags were hung on the city gates. There was no resistance in the city at the time, so the order was very quiet, and the shops in the city still traded as usual without any disturbance, and the city of Shanghai was "lost"! (omitted)

On the sixteenth day of the ninth lunar month (November 6) – the third day after the recovery, the comrades of the uprising held a meeting in the Haifang Hall in Xiaodongmen to organize the Shanghai Military Government, and elected Chen Yingshi as the Military Governor of Shanghai. At that time, the Yue Army Jizi Camp stationed in Wusong had also begun to revolt. On the 17th, Chen Yingshi appointed Wu Tingfang as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Shen Maozhao as the Minister of Finance. On the 18th, the Minister of Civil Affairs appointed a civil affairs chief of Shanghai County, Huang Qingchao as the judicial chief of Shanghai County, Mo Xilun as the mayor, and Wei Sougui as the deputy mayor, and changed the original "City Self-Government Office" to "City Hall". At the same time, the Shanghai Military Governor's Office also appointed Li Xianmo as the Commander of the Shanghai Water and Land Army. The Shanghai Military Governor's Office then became the highest military and political authority of the Shanghai Revolution.

After the recovery of Shanghai, righteous armies in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang also launched uprisings one after another. On the fifteenth day of the ninth lunar month, the Suzhou People's Army launched an uprising; on the twenty-first day, Zhenjiang launched an uprising, and the naval warships followed suit; on the twenty-second day, the Jiangyin Fort expressed unified action; on the twenty-fifth day, the Shanghai Army attacked Nanjing; on the twenty-sixth day, the Zhejiang People's Army responded and launched a joint attack; on the fifth day of the tenth lunar month, the armies of Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang joined forces to attack Nanjing, and on the twelfth day, Nanjing was captured. The Qing government was in a bad position and had to yield and sue for peace.

Having written this, the whole story of Shanghai's recovery has been roughly narrated, and this "Record of the Recovery of Shanghai" can also be concluded. However, we would also like to specially mention Chen Yingshi, the Military Governor of Shanghai who recovered Shanghai, and Li Pingshu, the leader of the Shanghai Merchant Corps, and the members of the Merchant Corps who participated in the recovery and made outstanding contributions.

The Shanghai Military Governor's Office was abolished in July of the first year of the Republic of China due to Chen Yingshi's resignation. At that time, Yuan Shikai had become the Provisional President, and the general situation was irreversible. In the second year of the Republic of China, the anti-Yuan army rose up. On July 18 of that year, Chen established the headquarters of the anti-Yuan army in Shanghai in Nanshi, but unfortunately failed. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor. On May 18 of the following year, Chen Yingshi was assassinated in Shanghai by Yuan Shikai's henchmen.

After the members of the Shanghai Merchant Corps recovered their hometown, they also actively participated in several battles in Jiangnan afterwards. When the founding father took office in Nanjing, the Merchant Corps served as the Imperial Guard. However, after Yuan Shikai came to power, the entire group had to be disbanded.

But, although those who died have died, and those who dispersed have dispersed, their merits and their spirit should be forever engraved in the hearts of every Shanghainese.

Today, in this festive day of national jubilation, we are excited to remember the revolutionary giants who recovered Shanghai, and to remember the heroic sacrifices of countless martyrs thirty-six years ago! As a Shanghainese, how should we inherit the spirit of our predecessors and contribute to our hometown?

### Eighty Years of Chinese Shipping (Continued from Page Seventeen)

Loss of Shipping Rights and Its Impact Before the War

The loss of our country's shipping rights before the Anti-Japanese War began with the Sino-British Treaty of Nanjing in the 22nd year of Daoguang (1842) of the Late Qing Dynasty, in which the second clause stated: "British people are allowed to bring their families and reside in the five coastal ports of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai, and trade without obstruction," and the fourth clause of the supplementary treaty to the Sino-British Trade Regulations in the 23rd year of Daoguang (1843): "British merchants are only allowed to trade in our country." The Late Qing government was not aware of the importance of shipping rights. At that time, there were no restrictions on British people traveling back and forth, and they were allowed to trade, and it was inevitable that they would carry both passengers and goods. Although there were no formal regulations on coastal trade, in fact, our country's laissez-faire policy was extremely beneficial to these British merchants. Therefore, since the conclusion of the Treaty of Nanjing, our country's coastal trade has fallen into the hands of Westerners.

The loss of shipping rights on the Yangtze River began in the eighth year of Xianfeng (1858). The tenth clause of the Sino-British Supplementary Treaty stipulated: "British merchants can trade in the Yangtze River area," and in the tenth year of Xianfeng (1861), there were also Yangtze River trade regulations. At that time, the Late Qing government had in fact allowed foreign merchants to travel back and forth to various ports along the Yangtze River to transport native goods. From then on, British merchant ships filled the river, and the shipping rights of the Yangtze River were lost from then on!

With the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Shimonoseki in the 21st year of Guangxu (1895), Japanese ships were allowed to sail to Shashi, Chongqing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, and they were allowed to carry passengers and load goods. Foreign ships thus sailed into our country's inland ports. Two years later, the Sino-British Burma Treaty allowed British ships to go to various ports in South China - Xijiang, Wuzhou, and Guangzhou to berth, and everything was handled in the same way as the Yangtze River trade regulations. By the 28th year of Guangxu (1902), foreign ships' navigation rights had reached all parts of our country's coast, South China, and the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and they were expanding day by day. By the 29th year of Guangxu (1903), the Sino-Japanese Trade and Navigation Supplementary Treaty allowed Japanese ships to travel to the three northeastern provinces and the inland ports of Yantai, in addition to sailing to various ports along the Yangtze River. The power of foreign ships extended from central and southern China to the northeastern part of our country.

Before the conclusion of the above-mentioned unequal treaties; foreigners knew that the Late Qing government was extremely timid, only paying attention to taxes and not knowing what shipping rights were, and many officials even thought that foreign ships would help our country develop its commerce. All of this contributed to foreign merchants first trying to encroach and creating a fait accompli. Over time, mistakes accumulated and became facts. When there was an opportunity - such as when our country was defeated by a foreign country, they would take the opportunity to force our country to sign a treaty and become a legitimate right. Therefore, since the establishment of the Republic of China, our country's shipping industry has never prospered, and international trade is even more unbearable. Westerners purchased our native goods back to their countries and shipped their manufactured products to dump them. China has become a hunting ground for all countries in the world; our country's sovereignty, national defense, transportation, and economy have all been infringed upon. If it were not for this Anti-Japanese War, China today would probably have become India ten years ago!

Shipping During the War of Resistance

Our country's weakness has long been known to its strong neighbor, Japan. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese enemy even wanted to use its entire land, sea, and air force to force our country to perish. Our country tolerated again and again and had to make good preparations and fight with them. In terms of shipping, the government first started with the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In October of the 21st year, it took over the company as a state-owned enterprise. In May of the following year, it used 360,000 pounds of the British Boxer Indemnity to order four ocean-going ships and three river ships. In June of the 23rd year, it promulgated the Ship Crew Qualification Regulations, and then trained a large number of personnel and sent them to ships with more than 1,000 tons owned by state-owned and private companies to study shipping affairs. Fuel was also stored in various parts of the Yangtze River to prepare for emergencies. Sichuan Province has a dangerous terrain and crisscrossing waterways, and it was planned to be the center of the Anti-Japanese War. The Ministry of Transportation ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Minsheng Company, and others to rush to build shallow-water wheels, etc., to prepare for sailing on the Sichuan River. Unfortunately, the construction of the shallow-water wheels built by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was not completed, and the Shanghai Battle had already begun!

On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, our country only had 600,000 tons of ships. Moreover, with the weak naval power, it could not protect transportation, so it had to try to preserve it to avoid benefiting the enemy and to maintain transportation to the rear. In August of the 26th year - the situation between China and Japan deteriorated. The Ministry of Transportation secretly telegraphed various shipping companies to quickly ship all ocean-going ships into the Yangtze River. Those that could not be shipped into the river went to Hong Kong. After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, except for 14 ocean-going ships that were captured by the enemy because they could not escape, the rest were preserved. When the situation in Wuhan became tense, the Hankou Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, together with military transportation agencies, urged the ships to withdraw to the west again. A total of 208 ships retreated to Yichang, 66 to Changsha, and 16 to Changde. Those not in the above withdrawal figures temporarily responded by sinking themselves in the port to block the tools - in the early seven years of the Anti-Japanese War, the number of ships that completed this task reached 87, weighing 110,000 tons. Shipping companies across the country were aware of the righteousness, regardless of the losses, and responded generously. This is the main reason why the Japanese pirate fleet could not go west. The withdrawn ships were responsible for transporting materials. Because it was urgent, the detailed quantities were not statistically recorded. Only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company transported 88,000 tons of public goods and 190,000 tons of commercial goods from August 14 of the 26th year to the end of the 28th year. The Minsheng Company transported more than 200,000 tons of military equipment and public goods from August of the 26th year to the end of the 29th year. The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was shallow, and the employees of various shipping companies worked hard in the midst of hardships, and their spirit was extremely admirable.

In this Anti-Japanese War, in addition to the government requisitioning ships to block waterways as passive resistance, the losses due to other reasons are listed below. (See: Simple Table of Ship Tonnage Lost During the Anti-Japanese War)

Simple Table of Number of Ships Lost During the Anti-Japanese War

Military Requisition for Blockage 119,986.50 tons

Bombed and Destroyed During Military and Public Transportation 15,891.00 tons

Captured by the Enemy 111,006.00 tons

Bombed and Sunk by the Enemy 49,357.74 tons

Total 296,241.24 tons

In summary, our country had no more than 600,000 tons of ships on the eve of the Anti-Japanese War. And those directly damaged by the Anti-Japanese War were nearly 300,000 tons, which has reached half. Among them, the losses due to military requisition for blockage work have been allocated with huge sums of money by our government, and special commissioners have been assigned to go to the United States to order new ships to compensate the damaged shipping companies.

### Shanghai Municipal Public Works in the Past Eighty Years

— Zhao Zengjue

1.  Introduction: Public utilities are public services closely related to people's daily lives. Therefore, railways, highways, shipping, post and telecommunications, etc., all fall within the scope of public utilities. However, because they have a national scope, they are all under state management. Modern commonly known public utilities mostly refer to the narrow sense, that is, local water supply, electricity, gas, telephone, land transportation, wharf warehouses, street lamp standards, etc., all belong to it.

The public utilities of Shanghai Municipality began in the Tongzhi period of the late Qing Dynasty. The earliest operators were British and French merchants, followed by American merchants. Chinese people quickly caught up and also started businesses in the Guangxu period, with large-scale preparations surpassing all major cities in the country. A chronological table is compiled below according to the order of their initial establishment:

Tongzhi 5th year of the Qing Dynasty (1866): The British Shanghai Gas Company was established, marking the beginning of gas lights and gas stoves in Shanghai.

Tongzhi 12th year of the Qing Dynasty (1873): A Frenchman named Menard imported a rickshaw from Japan. On the seventh day of the second month of Tongzhi 13th year (March 24, 1874), the French Concession Public Works Bureau issued the first rickshaw license, marking the beginning of rickshaws in Shanghai.

Guangxu 7th year of the Qing Dynasty (1881): The Great Northern Telegraph Company also operated telephone services in the concessions, marking the beginning of telephone service in Shanghai.

Guangxu 8th year of the Qing Dynasty (1882): The British Shanghai Waterworks Company was established, marking the beginning of tap water in Shanghai.

In the same year, the Western Shanghai Electric Company (the predecessor of the current Shanghai Electric Power Company) was established, marking the beginning of electric lights in Shanghai.

Guangxu 16th year of the Qing Dynasty (1890): The Public Concession began to use incandescent electric lights as street lamps, marking the beginning of electric street lamps in Shanghai.

Guangxu 23rd year of the Qing Dynasty (1897): The Shanghai Nanshi Road Works Rehabilitation Bureau prepared for electric lights, marking the beginning of electric lights in Shanghai Nanshi.

Guangxu 27th year of the Qing Dynasty (1901): A Hungarian named Leinz imported two automobiles, marking the beginning of automobiles in Shanghai.

Guangxu 28th year of the Qing Dynasty (1902): The Inland Waterworks Company opened, marking the beginning of tap water in Shanghai Nanshi.

In the same year, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau was established, marking the beginning of telephone service in urban Shanghai.

Guangxu 33rd year of the Qing Dynasty (1907): The Inland Electric Light Company (the predecessor of the current Chinese Electric Company) was established.

In the same year, the French Tramway and Electric Light Company was established, also operating water supply and public transportation, marking the beginning of water, electricity, and transportation in the French Concession of Shanghai.

Guangxu 34th year of the Qing Dynasty (1908): British and French merchants successively opened streetcar services, marking the beginning of trams in Shanghai.

Xuantong 2nd year of the Qing Dynasty (1908): The Pudong Embankment Works Rehabilitation Bureau opened the Pudong River Ferry, marking the beginning of ferries in Shanghai.

Republic of China 2nd year (1913): The Chinese Tramway Company opened, marking the beginning of trams in Shanghai Nanshi.

Republic of China 3rd year (1914): The British Shanghai Tramway Company opened trolleybus service, marking the beginning of trolleybuses in Shanghai.

Republic of China 13th year (1924): The British Shanghai Bus Company and the Chinese Bus Company successively opened, marking the beginning of buses in Shanghai.

Republic of China 26th year (1937): The city-run Pudong Waterworks Plant opened, marking the beginning of tap water in Shanghai Pudong.

As for the administrative agencies that supervise public utilities, in the past, it was the Public Works Bureau in the Public Concession and the Board of Directors in the French Concession. In the urban area, it was initially the Engineering Patrol Donation Bureau, and later the Municipal Government, but they were all concurrent in nature, with no specialized agency established at the beginning. It was not until the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) that a Public Utilities Bureau was set up and its responsibilities were defined, marking the beginning of Shanghai having an administrative agency in charge of public utilities. At that time, with the existence of the concessions, the Public Utilities Bureau exercised its powers only within the urban area, with a narrow scope and relatively simple affairs. Now, with the recovery of the concessions and the unification of administration, the Public Utilities Bureau is in charge of all public utilities in the city, and all Chinese and foreign merchants are under its supervision and guidance. The affairs are complicated and the responsibilities are heavy, which cannot be compared with the past.

During the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, when Shanghai fell, Shanghai's various public utilities were severely damaged and suffered heavy losses. In the autumn of the 34th year, the Anti-Japanese War was won, the concessions were recovered, and the Public Utilities Bureau, along with the Municipal Government, was re-established in this land, taking over the reorganization, planning the restoration, and advancing in different ways. In the past two years, Shanghai's various public utilities have gradually returned to their original state, and some have even surpassed pre-war records. They are listed and reported separately below:

2.  Water Supply

Evolution

In the eighth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1882), the British Shanghai Waterworks Company opened, supplying foreigners living in Shanghai, which was the beginning of Shanghai's water supply business. In the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896), the French Concession Board of Directors established its own waterworks. In the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906), the Board of Directors transferred the factory and its business rights to the French Tramway and Electric Light Company, and divided the business area with the Shanghai Waterworks Company, with the Yangjingbang as the boundary. At this point, the first and second special zones each had a waterworks. As for the waterworks operated by the Chinese, there were three in total. One was the Shanghai Inland Waterworks Company. In the 22nd year of Guangxu, Cao and others reported to the circuit intendant Liu Xiang to prepare for the establishment. The next year, the Hua Factory was built in Bansong Garden, and it was completed and put into operation in the 28th year of Guangxu (1902). The second was the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. In the late Qing Dynasty, the British Shanghai Waterworks Company laid water pipes beyond the boundary. The Governor-General of Liangjiang, Zhang Renjun, issued a warrant to the Shanghai Daoyin to borrow official funds to organize the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to protect sovereignty. It immediately built a factory in Tanziwan (now the end of Hengfeng Road). It was established in September of the 3rd year of Xuantong (October 1909). It was once taken over by the province, and in the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), it was changed to a commercial operation. A new factory was built at the junction of Hugang River and Jiangsong Bridge, and it was fully completed in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), with the old Tanzi factory as a water distribution plant. The third is the Pudong Waterworks. The Pudong districts "have never had any water supply facilities. The Shanghai Municipal Government, in view of the increasing number of residents in Pudong and the urgent need for water, ordered the Public Utilities Bureau to prepare for the establishment. However, due to insufficient funding, Song Neng actively proceeded. In October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the Municipal Government ordered the Xingye Trust Company to prepare for the establishment. In September of the 24th year (1935), the factory was built at the exit of Youlong Road in Pudong. In June of the 26th year (1937), the project was completed and water supply began.

During the Anti-Japanese War, "except for the French Concession Waterworks Company, the remaining Shanghai waterworks were merged and operated by the Shanghai Waterway Branch of the China Water and Electricity Company. In September of the 34th year, the Public Utilities Bureau was ordered to take over. Except for the Pudong Waterworks, which was continued to be operated by the Public Utilities Bureau, the rest were returned to their original owners.

Restoration Status

During the enemy occupation period, the water supply facilities were allowed to deteriorate, the sand in the water pools was not replaced for many years, and the disinfection products were deliberately reduced. Not only was the water quality turbid, but the leakage also reached more than 60% due to the damaged water pipes, which greatly affected the citizens' use. The companies were urged to repair the water pipes, and the leakage gradually decreased to about 30%. At the same time, the Health Bureau and the waterworks repeatedly discussed and formulated the "Shanghai Drinking Water Cleanliness Standard." The main points were that the number of bacteria in each cubic centimeter (CC) of water should not exceed 100, and the number of coliform bacteria in each liter should not exceed 10. The sum of temporary hardness and permanent hardness should not exceed 300. In terms of total water output, the average daily water output was about 330,000 cubic meters at the time of takeover. By July of the 36th year, it was more than 571,301 cubic meters, which had surpassed the highest pre-war record of more than 452,000 cubic meters of water supply per day.

In Shanghai, only the Hongqiao area felt that the water volume and water pressure were insufficient, causing panic. In order to fundamentally solve the problem, the Public Utilities Bureau planned to establish the Hongqiao Waterworks Company, but the project was difficult and costly, and could not be accomplished overnight. In order to meet the current urgent needs, the Hongqiao water supply emergency project was launched. In addition to ordering the British Shanghai Waterworks Company to restore the west end of Zhongshan Park and the free-flowing wells of the Jiaozhou Road water pumping station, in order to provide water for the residents east of Gubei Road, north of Xianxia Zhongzheng West Road, a water pool with a capacity of 2,000 cubic meters was built on Zhongzheng West Road, and three water pumping machines were installed to transfer 3,000 cubic meters of water from the Shanghai Waterworks Company to the residents west of Huashan Road, north of Chahar Road, east of Kaixuan Road, and south of Zhongzheng West Road. However, the area from the intersection of Jiangsu Road and Zhongshan Road south along Huashan Road to Gubei Road cannot be remedied without drilling new artesian wells. After surveying, three 8-inch diameter artesian wells were drilled at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Yili Road, the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Linsen West Road, and the intersection of Huashan Road and Linsen West Road, with a total daily water output of 2,400 cubic meters. After the completion of the entire Hongqiao emergency project, the daily water supply can be supplemented by 11,000 cubic meters, which can be increased by about 50% based on the current daily water supply of 21,000 cubic meters, which is enough to supply water for 60,000 people, and the water shortage can be alleviated.

In order to cooperate with the future prosperity of Pudong, the Pudong Waterworks must expand its equipment to meet the needs. Under the guidance of the Public Utilities Bureau, the factory has implemented the expansion of water pipes. The first phase of the project plans to extend the existing main pipe from No. 6 Bridge on Pudong Road to Minsheng Road Lanyan Chimney Pier via 18 Jian Town. The second step is to extend it to Yangjing Town. For the water supply facilities at the pier, the following locations are being completed: China Merchants Bureau Pier Nos. 5, 7, 8, 9, Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs No. 3 Warehouse, Gonghexing East and West Warehouses, Taikoo Pudong Warehouse, and Huatong Warehouse. In addition, in order to handle the water supply for ships in the river, a water supply ship has been purchased and will be completed soon, and a contract can be signed with various shipping companies to supply water.

3.  Electricity

Evolution

Shanghai's electricity business began with the Western Shanghai Electric Company (now the American Shanghai Electric Power Company), which opened in the eighth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1882). Following this, the French Tramway and Electric Light Company and the Chinese-operated Inland Electric Light Company were both established in the 33rd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1907). In the 3rd year of Xuantong (1909), the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was established. In the 7th year of the Republic of China (1918), the Inland Electric Light Company and the Chinese Tramway Company merged to form the Chinese Electric Company. Soon after, the Baoming, Pudong, Zhenru, and Xianghua power plants were also established successively. From the 20th to the 24th year of the Republic of China, in order to solve the problem of power supply to the Shanghai Hongqiao boundary road, the Shanghai Municipal Government negotiated with the American Shanghai Electric Power Company several times. On January 4th of the 24th year of the Republic of China, an agreement was signed to establish the Shanghai Hongqiao Electric Power Co., Ltd., with Chinese capital accounting for 49% of the shares, and the rest belonging to the Shanghai Electric Power Company.

During the occupation period, except for the French Electric Light Company, the Shanghai Hongqiao, Chinese, Zhabei, Pudong, and other electric companies were forcibly merged by the Shanghai Electric Branch of the enemy's China Water and Electricity Company. After the victory, the Zhenru and Xianghua power plants were destroyed during the war and no longer exist. The rest were taken over by the Public Utilities Bureau and handed over to the original owners for continued operation.

Restoration Overview

The electrical companies suffered heavy losses due to the enemy's long-term occupation. In particular, the power generation equipment of the Zhabei, Chinese, and Pudong electrical companies was completely dismantled, and they could only purchase electricity from the Shanghai Electric Power Company for resale. The total installed capacity of Shanghai's power plants before the war was 260,000 kilowatts. At the beginning of the takeover, the city's power generation was only 124,000 kilowatts, less than half of the pre-war capacity. The power supply was extremely tight, and the supply could not meet the demand, causing great pain to the citizens. After the Public Utilities Bureau coordinated the takeover, it supervised the companies to repair the damaged machines and ordered new machines, moving forward in different ways. By the end of the 34th year, the city's power generation had increased to 141,000 kilowatts. In May of the 35th year, the Shanghai Power Supply Review Committee was organized to determine the priority of power supply according to the urgency of use, so as to adjust the load time of users of various electrical companies and balance the load factor. By July of the 36th year, it had increased to 182,000 kilowatts, but the demand from users was increasing day by day, and the demand for electricity from factories was particularly urgent, and it was still insufficient to meet the supply, so efforts were made to supervise the increase of equipment. The 21,500 kilowatt generator that the Shanghai Electric Power Company sent to the United States for repair was soon shipped back and installed. In addition, a 15,000 kilowatt high-voltage generator that was newly added before the war and not used was repaired and put into formal power generation. The No. 7 generator of the French Tramway and Electric Light Company, which was damaged, was repaired and generated 3,000 kilowatts. A new 3,600 kilowatt generator was also installed and put into power generation. In addition to generating 9,500 kilowatts on its own, the Zhabei Electric Company also obtained 1,500 kilowatts from the Wusong Wing On Textile Factory. The Pudong Electric Company ordered a set of 2,500 kilowatt steam turbine generator equipment from the British Mauffer Electric Factory, which has been installed and put into power generation. Recently, it has applied to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for a set of 800 kilowatt diesel power generation equipment, which will soon be transported to Shanghai for installation. In addition, after the Chinese Electric Company leased the generator of the Shanghai Cement Company, it has generated 700 kilowatts, and has also applied to the Executive Yuan for the purchase of two new 2,000 kilowatt machines, and has paid half of the payment. After delivery, they can be installed. In summary, the above-mentioned increase in power generation is about 50,000 kilowatts. The table below shows the power supplied to the city and the industrial power from the time of takeover to July of the 36th year: (Note) The number of electricity sales in the city does not include the amount of electricity sold by the same industry.

Although the power supply has increased slightly, the electricity shortage has not been resolved. The Public Utilities Bureau originally planned a rationalization plan for Shanghai's electricity, and the Shanghai "Council passed a proposal in the 36th year to "organize an electrical company." The Public Utilities Bureau immediately summoned the American electrical companies several times to discuss the matter. A consistent principle was passed, and the detailed methods and contracts are being negotiated. The date of establishment should not be far away. On the central side, after the Shanghai Municipal Government's request, it has agreed to allocate a set of 53,000 kilowatt generators from the Japanese compensation generators to be received by the United Electrical Company. In the near future, the city's electricity shortage will hopefully improve.

### Eighty Years of Chinese Shipping (Continued from page twenty)

The shipping situation from the victory to the present

The United Kingdom and the United States of America, in appreciation of the heroic resistance and arduous struggle of our government and people, re-signed a new treaty of equality with our country on January 10 of the seventh year of the Anti-Japanese War. The century-old shackles were lifted at once. The treaty includes shipping rights, such as coastal trade rights, inland navigation rights, pilotage rights, etc., which were completely recovered, which is truly gratifying.

In September of the 34th year, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Communications established special commissioners' offices in Beijing-Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, and Guangdong, each with shipping administration receiving commissioners, and received a total of 2,751 ships from the Japanese enemy, with a total tonnage of 251,288 tons (of which 20 were over 1,000 tons, 23 were from 501 tons to 1,000 tons, and the rest were mostly small steamers, and many were barges, most of which had to be repaired before they could be used).

Restoration and transportation: Water transport occupies a major position. Under the circumstances of ship shortage, those in charge have made the greatest efforts. From September 16 of the 34th year to the end of January of the 35th year, the waterways transported 11,760 government personnel, 5,100 family members, 19,237 tons of public and commercial goods, 38,600 troops, and 13,535 tons of military supplies (the above figures refer to those transported eastward from Chongqing, and others transported from Wanxian and Badong are not included). In February of the 35th year, the Ministry of Communications proposed the National Government's water, land, and air joint transportation plan to return to the capital. In the first phase, 80,000 people and 46,000 tons of materials were transported from Chongqing to Nanjing by water, and fortunately, the tasks were completed as scheduled.

After the victory, while busy with restoration and transportation, and due to the extreme shortage of ships, our government rented and purchased ships from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and expanded the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy to make it at least capable of repairing merchant ships first, and then hoped that it could manufacture its own ships. According to the statistics of July this year, the number of ships and tonnage in the country are as follows: Our country has 2,381 ships, with a total tonnage of 722,100 tons (the above figures include state-owned, private, and provincial ships).

In terms of air transport, in addition to the old Zhangjiang Line and North and South Ocean Lines, which are regularly operated by state-owned and private companies, the most economical development is the China Merchants Bureau's active preparation for foreign shipping in addition to the transportation of national and public troops. In the past few months, eight foreign shipping lines have been opened one after another:

Shanghai-Hong Kong Line - from Shanghai to Hong Kong, the total distance is 823 nautical miles.

China-Vietnam Line - from Shanghai to Fangcheng, the total distance is 1,039 nautical miles.

China-Thailand Line - from Shanghai via Shantou, Hong Kong, to Bangkok, the total distance is 2,350 nautical miles.

China-Guam Line - from Shanghai to Guam, the total distance is 1,687 nautical miles.

Hong Kong-Xiamen-Manila Line - from Hong Kong via Xiamen to Manila, the total distance is 778 nautical miles.

Hong Kong-Singapore Line - from Hong Kong to Singapore, the total distance is 1,448 nautical miles.

China-India Line - from Shanghai via Hong Kong, Singapore, Yangon to Calcutta, the total distance is 3,853 nautical miles.

China-Japan Line - from Shanghai to Sasebo, Kobe.

In addition, the Zhonglian Shipping Company's Zhenlian ship once sailed from Shanghai to Sydney, Australia, which is also a feat of China's shipping industry after the war.

How to Develop Shipping

After the recovery, the needs of domestic inland and coastal passenger and freight transportation should be supplied by the Chinese themselves. Therefore, not only should the original ships and tonnage of the country before the war be restored by themselves, but also the foreign ships and tonnage that sailed in our inland and coastal areas before the war should also be made up for by the current shipping companies. In the North and South Oceans and the distant oceans, at least a part of Japan's original shipping status should also be replaced by us. If our government is determined to promote and encourage the national shipping companies to cooperate and move forward, there seems to be no great difficulty in achieving these two goals. However, during this transition period, three things should be done at the same time:

(A) Resist the bad habits of the shipping industry - Shipping is an important social undertaking. The relations between all parties are extremely complex. All operations must be carried out with the spirit of the rule of law and scientific methods in order to innovate the business. Many past bad habits - such as cabin attendants or waiters on ships forcing tips or selling berths, dock workers randomly demanding tips, etc., must be completely eliminated. Shipping companies should jointly establish training classes for low-level crew members to train or recruit a new batch of employees, and then gradually establish a new atmosphere.

(B) Promote shipping construction - The allocation of various ships, the equipment of docks, and the expansion of shipyards across the country must be carried out in a timely manner.

(C) Train naval talents - The lack of naval talents can be seen from the fact that some private shipping companies still use Westerners as captains. If they are not cultivated in time, they will be even more insufficient in the future. The government should strengthen commercial, maritime, and fisheries schools. A hundred years of cultivating people is the fundamental solution.

These three tasks; at present, the China Merchants Bureau is reforming the bad habits of docks, self-managing labor, actively repairing warehouses and docks across the country, and opening crew training classes. Although there are many difficulties, the bureau is making unremitting efforts. All private shipping companies are also joining forces to work hard to improve, and satisfactory results will be achieved in a considerable period of time.

For a century, according to the figures published by the customs, our country's import and export figures have often been far greater than exports, which is the main reason for our country's poverty and weakness. What is the reason for this? To put it simply, the authorities in charge have deeply ignored the importance of shipping and foreign trade. This can be illustrated by the current situation in the United Kingdom: At present, the United Kingdom is feeling the lack of food and fuel, and the United States is automatically willing to provide assistance, but the British authorities require that all assistance be carried by British ships.

### Shanghai's Public Utilities Over the Past Eighty Years (Continued from Page Twenty-One)

Four: Gas

Historical Development

The British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company was established in the fifth year of the reign of Tongzhi during the Qing Dynasty (1866). In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of Guangxu (1901), it expanded its shares and registered with the Hong Kong government. Its business area included both concessions, making it the only gas company in the city. In the winter of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China (1938), the Japanese opened a gas factory in Beiqi Bay, Zhanghuabang, Wusong. They also established the Greater Shanghai Gas Company as a business office in Wujiaochang in the central urban area, aiming to compete with the British-owned Shanghai Gas Company. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese seized the company and merged it with the Wusong Gas Factory to operate as the so-called Greater Shanghai Gas Company. With the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Public Utilities Bureau took over the gas factory and renamed it the Wusong Gas Factory, making it one of the city's public utilities. The Shanghai Gas Company was returned to its original owners and is now known as the Shanghai Gas Company.

Overview of the Post-War Recovery

After the Wusong Gas Factory was taken over by the Public Utilities Bureau, it was immediately reorganized and its equipment was enhanced. Gas production increased from 280,000 cubic meters per month (January of the 35th year of the Republic) to 445,995 cubic meters (December of the 35th year of the Republic), providing a surplus. The Bureau then negotiated a contract with the Shanghai Gas Company to jointly supply gas to the Hongkou area, starting in December of the 35th year of the Republic. The Wusong Factory sold 100,000 to 700,000 cubic feet of gas to the Gas Company daily to supplement its supply shortage.

Gas is the most economical and clean fuel, and the public's need for it is extremely urgent. In order to promote gas supply for the benefit of the public, the Public Utilities Bureau planned a city-wide gas network to achieve balanced distribution. It planned to establish a gas factory in Nanshi. The Nanshi Gas Design Office was established in October of the 35th year of the Republic to be responsible for the planning. A preliminary plan has been completed. Before the factory is built, it was decided that the Wusong Gas Factory would first lay a main pipe under Xizang Road to reach Nanshi, and then distribute branches to various roads. The preliminary plan is to connect 500 households first, which should be realized soon.

Five: Land Transportation

Historical Development

(A) Tram Section: The exclusive right of the British-owned Shanghai Tramways Company was transferred by Bruce, Peebles Co. In the thirty-fourth year of the reign of Guangxu during the Qing Dynasty (1908), streetcars began operating in the Public Concession. In November of the third year of the Republic of China (1914), trackless trolleys began operating. The French-owned Tramway and Electric Lighting Company purchased the equipment of the Belgian International Far East Company. Streetcars began operating in January of the thirty-fourth year of the reign of Guangxu. Trackless trolleys began operating in August of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926), operating in the French Concession. In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), Shanghai gentry Lu Bohong and others raised funds to organize the Chinese-owned Tramways Company. It began operating on August 11 of the second year of the Republic of China, operating in the Hunan district of Shanghai. In the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918), it was merged into the Chinese-owned Electric Company. (B) Bus Section: The Chinese-owned Bus Company was established in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), operating in Zhabei, Jiangwan, the city center, Yinxiang, Zhenru, and other districts. It ceased operations due to the military impact of the Sino-Japanese War. The British-owned China Bus Company was also established in the same year, operating in the Public Concession. After the Shanghai-Hunan Bus Company ceased operations, the Public Utilities Bureau established the Bus Management Office in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China (1934) to maintain transportation in Nanshi and Caojing. (C) Small Line Section: One is the Shangnan Transportation Company, and the other is the Shangchuan Transportation Company. The former was initiated in the spring of the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921). It first organized the Shangchang Long-Distance Bus Company, operating Ford buses. It then paved tracks to operate small trains in response to the needs of travelers. In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933), it was renamed Shangnan Transportation Co., Ltd. The latter was prepared in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921). Construction of the  Road began in February of the eleventh year (1922). The company was established in April of the thirteenth year (1924). The section from Qingning Temple to Xijia Road opened first in October of the fourteenth year (1925). The entire line was completed and opened to traffic in July of the fifteenth year (1926). In addition, long-distance buses connecting neighboring counties included the Shanghai-Tai Long-Distance Bus Company, which opened in January of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, and the Shanghai  Long-Distance Bus Company, which opened in December of the same year. The Shangsong Long-Distance Bus Company was founded on October 10 of the twenty-first year of the Republic. The Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company opened on August 15 of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, all based in this city, forming a transportation radiation pattern.

During the period of occupation, the Japanese forcibly occupied the British-owned Tramways Company and the British-owned China Bus Company, merging and reorganizing them into the Shanghai Urban Transportation Company. The Shangchuan and Shangnan Transportation Companies were occupied by the puppet municipal government, which then established the Shangchuan and Shangnan Road Management Offices to control them. Other long-distance buses were either used by our army for military purposes or seized by the enemy, and all ceased operations. After the victory, the Public Utilities Bureau took over the companies separately, returning them to their original owners. However, the British-owned China Bus Company declared its closure because it had no vehicles left due to wartime damage. The tram section of the Chinese-owned Electric Company was completely dismantled by the enemy and puppets and sent to Tianjin. Negotiations are still underway to recover it, and recovery is not expected in the near future, which is regrettable.

Overview of the Post-War Recovery

The city had a total of 28 streetcar and trackless trolley lines operated by Chinese, British, and French companies before the war, which were reduced to 12 lines during the war. Since the city's recovery, under the supervision of the Public Utilities Bureau, the British side has restored eight streetcar lines and six trackless trolley lines. The French side has restored five streetcar lines, three trackless trolley lines, and two bus lines. In order to facilitate travel, the Public Utilities Bureau promoted the replacement of tracks on Huashan Road by the British and French companies to implement joint operations. However, this can only be realized after Huashan Road is widened due to the narrow road surface.

At the beginning of the victory, the city's public transportation was severely destroyed by the enemy. With few vehicles and many people, it was difficult to meet the needs. In view of this, the Public Utilities Bureau tried its best to prepare buses. In the winter of the 34th year of the Republic, the Bus Company Preparatory Committee and the Tram Company Preparatory Office were established to actively promote the project. First, the military department was requested to issue 100 old vehicles, which were dismantled and transformed into buses to provide service. Subsequently, large loans were negotiated with banks, and new vehicles were purchased and routes were added. By November of the 35th year of the Republic, in order to centralize planning, the two preparatory institutions were merged and renamed the Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee. As of July of this year, there were 171 buses operating on 11 lines, totaling 66 kilometers.

For suburban transportation, the policy is to encourage private operation. Suburban routes are designated, and before formally operating companies begin operations, motor vehicle companies or Shanghai bus companies holding temporary road operation licenses are temporarily allowed to operate temporary detour passenger vehicles. There are already seven companies that have been approved to operate:

The former Shangnan two small railways have also been repaired and equipped by the Public Utilities Bureau, and the number of services has been increased. Transportation between various places in Pudong and this city has also gradually returned to the pre-war state.

In addition to the above, there are more and more other vehicles in the city. According to the statistics at the end of July of the 36th year, the numbers are as follows:

However, since most streets have not been widened, how to improve such a complicated situation with so many vehicles has become a very difficult problem to solve. (Continued on page 23) The calendar in the first year of the Republic used the Yellow Emperor's era on the cover.

Six: Water Transportation

Historical Development

The banks of the Huangpu River are densely populated, and business dealings are frequent. Before the establishment of ferry services, water transportation relied entirely on hand-rowed boats, which were dangerous, time-consuming, and very inconvenient. In September of the second year of the reign of Xuantong (1910), the Pudong Embankment Works Relief Bureau leased small ferries to operate between the east and west sides of Pudong to facilitate office work, carrying passengers and charging ferry fares. After reporting to the county-level agencies for registration, a trial voyage was conducted on December 5, marking the beginning of government-run ferry services. Initially, the route ran directly from Donggou to the Copper Statue Pier on the Bund of Nanjing Road. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, the Xidu route was added, and in the eighth year, the Xi  route was added. The ferries used at the beginning were all leased. In the second year of the Republic of China, the first ferry, the Gongyi, was built. In July of the eleventh year, the Gongfu ferry was purchased and renamed the Gongan. In addition, there were seven large and small tugboats such as the Gongli, Gongji, and Gongdao, and three other fast boats and sampans, operating in Dong  , Qingning Temple, Xidu, and other places. Docks were also built. In the autumn of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), the Shanghai Special Municipality was established, and the ferry service was transferred from the Embankment Works Bureau. Initially, it was temporarily managed by the Pudong Office of the Municipal Government. In December of the same year, the office was abolished, and the Public Utilities Bureau and the Finance Bureau took over the management, establishing the Pudong Ferry Management Office. In July of the seventeenth year (1928), the Finance Bureau transferred the original management and operation to the Public Utilities Bureau, renaming the Pudong Ferry Management Office the Pujiang Ferry Management Office. In the nineteenth year, it was renamed the Ferry General Management Office. In August of the twentieth year, the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company took over the city's ferry business and renamed it the Shanghai Ferry Management Office.

All fourteen ferries of the office were requisitioned during the war. Subsequently, the puppet municipal government reorganized it into the Shanghai Special Municipality Ferry Company, with only five ferries and four docks remaining. After the Public Utilities Bureau took over in September of the 34th year, it established the Ferry Company Preparatory Office to continue operations.

Overview of the Post-War Recovery

The Public Utilities Bureau realized that the ferry service had the mission of developing the Pudong area and relieving the pressure of the population between the east and west sides of the Huangpu River. Its importance cannot be underestimated, and it is necessary to pool resources, expand equipment, and open up routes. Therefore, the Shanghai Ferry Company Preparatory Office was first established to organize a joint public-private limited company. After more than a year of effort, it was finally completed. The total capital was set at 1.5 billion national currency. The existing city ferries, docks, and all equipment were evaluated as public shares, accounting for one-third of the total capital. The remaining two-thirds, which were non-public shares, were negotiated to be subscribed by banks and citizens. The founding meeting was held on November 20 of the 35th year, and an exclusive contract was signed with the municipal government. By March of the 36th year, the company was formally established.

In the past, the ferry service only provided transportation for passengers. However, Pudong has many warehouses and docks. Goods crossing the river must be transferred, resulting in huge losses of time and money, which has further increased prices. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the Public Utilities Bureau decided to build a truck ferry before the cross-river project could be implemented. It urged the city ferry service to actively carry out the project and worked with the Public Works Bureau and the Land Administration Bureau to survey and determine the location of the docks. The south bank of Pudong was designated as the south pier, and the Lujiabang Branch Road on the west bank was designated as the west pier. Construction began in June of the 36th year, and the required ferries have also been purchased. It is scheduled to open to traffic on October 10.

Regarding the private ferry services, there were more than 30 locations along the Huangpu and Wusong Rivers before the war, but most of them ceased operations during the war. After the city's recovery, the Public Utilities Bureau immediately urged them to resume operations one by one. Currently, there are 32 locations that have signed contracts to operate. In order to ensure the safety of travelers, important ferries on the Huangpu River have been ordered to switch to tugboats, and ferries on the Wusong River have been ordered to switch to standard ferries. As of July of the 36th year, 12 ferries on the Huangpu River have been converted to tugboats, and 14 ferries on the Wusong River have been converted to standard ferries.

Seven: Docks and Warehouses

Historical Development

The Huangpu River stretches for more than 40 kilometers from Jiansong Bridge in Nanshi to Wusong. Docks are densely distributed along both banks of the Huangpu River. Some are built by the city itself, some are built by the former Public Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council, some are built by Chinese, and some are operated by foreign merchants. They vary in size and structure. In Nanshi, there are a total of 21 city-owned docks of various sizes. Along the Suzhou River, from Waibaidu Bridge to Jujia Bridge, there are 174 fixed small docks, most of which are city-owned, except for a few built by merchants. In order to manage docks and warehouses, the Public Utilities Bureau established the Docks and Warehouses Management Office in the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931) to dredge shorelines, repair docks and revetments, and plan the construction of docks. After the city's recovery and the recovery of the concessions, in addition to transferring the docks to their original owners by the Maritime Administration Bureau and the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office based on the nature of the ownership of each dock, those belonging to the municipal government and the former Public Works Bureau and Municipal Council were taken over and managed by the Public Utilities Bureau. In October of the 34th year, the Docks and Warehouses Management Office was restored to execute its original duties.

Overview of the Post-War Recovery

All 21 city-owned docks in Nanshi were scattered by the enemy during the war. The six docks that remained were moved from other places and were not the original ones. After the victory, shipping resumed, and the need for docks was extremely urgent. It was urgent to plan and restore them in a unified manner. In addition to partial repairs to accommodate ships, the Nanshi Docks Restoration Committee was organized in February of the 36th year to carry out the restoration project in two phases. The first phase was to repair docks 1 to 9, and the second phase was to repair the remaining docks. The first phase was entrusted to the Public Works Bureau and began in early February of the 36th year and is about to be completed. Except for Dock 7, which is a wooden floating dock with a wooden surface, and Dock 8, which is a steel floating dock with a cement surface, the rest are steel floating docks with a steel surface. It is now planned to establish this area as a model dock area in the city. The second phase will begin after the first phase is completed.

The Nanshi docks were not dredged at all during the period of occupation, and the silt was very thick. Without dredging, ships could not dock, and even if there were docks, they would be useless. Therefore, before repairing the docks, the Public Utilities Bureau entrusted the Junpu Bureau to dredge them. Dredging work was carried out on Docks 1 to 9 in November of the 35th year and was completed in April of the 36th year. Dredging was then continued on Docks 10 to 12 and Docks 1 to 7 and 11 to 14 of the Waixiao Company to facilitate berthing.

Eight: Telephone

Historical Development

Shanghai's telephone service was initiated by the Great Northern Telegraph Company, which was established in the seventh year of the reign of Guangxu (1881) and also operated special zone telephone services on a small scale. The following year, it was taken over by the China-Japan Telephone Company. In the twenty-fourth year of the reign of Guangxu (1898), the China-Foreign Telephone Company took over the concession telephone service and signed an exclusive contract with the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession. It was announced to be established in the following year (1899). In August of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), the company sold all its assets to the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, and the installation of rotary automatic telephones in the concession was completed in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China. The city telephone service was operated by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. The bureau was established in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Guangxu (1902). Initially, the scale was very small. It was not until the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920) that it purchased land to build its own office building. In the eighteenth year (1929), it installed step-by-step automatic telephones, and its business gradually expanded, communicating with the concession telephones through a transfer method.

Overview of the Post-War Recovery

During the enemy occupation, Shanghai's telephone equipment and lines were not only not added to, but also severely damaged. The destruction was particularly severe in Nanshi, Zhabei, and other districts. Now that the population has increased sharply, and the number of machines has decreased for many years, the Bureau feels that the supply cannot meet the demand. The Shanghai Telephone Company already has too many machines in arrears. Under the supervision of the Public Utilities Bureau, it has ordered 10,000 new machines from abroad, which will allow it to expand its subscribers after they arrive. The Public Utilities Bureau has also supervised and urged the company to improve its management and technology. Over the past two years, the situation has improved. According to the company's report, the percentage of calls that are dialed within five seconds has increased from 72.1% to 86.1%. At the same time, the "Temporary Restrictions on Telephone Installation" were formulated to meet the urgent needs of military and government agencies. Ordinary telephones are temporarily restricted from being installed. The Public Utilities Bureau and the company also jointly run a telephone engineering training class to prepare telephone technical personnel.

In addition, the supervision of the publication of new telephone directories is also worth mentioning. The city's telephone directory had long been discontinued. After the recovery, the addresses and names of subscribers changed greatly. Not only was it difficult for subscribers to inquire, but the company's inquiry office was particularly overwhelmed. Therefore, in the spring of the 35th year, the Public Utilities Bureau began to negotiate with the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to publish a unified telephone directory, including both new and old street names, which would not only make it easier for users to check, but also promote the new street names. With the assistance of the Public Utilities Bureau, the company completed the investigation and compilation. The manuscript was completed at the end of October of the 35th year, with a total of over 65,000 subscribers and 90,000 telephones. The Chinese Science Company printed 100,000 copies of the 1,000-page Chinese version and 20,000 copies of the 550-page Western version, consuming more than 200 tons of paper. The printing was completed in February of the 36th year and distributed for use.

Nine: Streetlights, Standard Clocks Streetlights

Shanghai's streetlights were established in the eighth year of the reign of Guangxu (1882). Initially, arc lights were operated by the Shanghai Electric Company. In the sixteenth year of the reign of Guangxu, incandescent electric lights began to be used as streetlights. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, there was a total of 23,799 lights in the city. The losses were heavy during the war, especially in the old urban areas of Zhabei, Hunan, and Pudong, which were almost completely destroyed. Since the recovery, the Public Utilities Bureau has actively repaired and added lights. As of July of the 36th year, the city has gradually restored a total of 15,309 lights, an increase of 7,274 lights compared to the 8,035 lights when it was first taken over. However, there is still a long way to go to restore the pre-war state. Traffic lights are a necessary equipment for traffic control. The Public Utilities Bureau has added 18 locations in the most congested central area. In Nanshi, one set each has been added at the intersection of Laoximen Xieqiao Zhizaoju Road, the intersection of Dongmen Road Lima Road, and the intersection of Laobeimen  Hailu Road to meet the needs.

Standard Clock

In order to standardize the time and cultivate the public's habit of punctuality, the Public Utilities Bureau installed standard clocks on the main roads of Hunan and Zhabei in the 20th year of the Republic of China. The project was completed and put into use in October of that year, with a total of two master clocks and 24 slave clocks. All were destroyed during the war. After the victory, the Public Utilities Bureau has repaired and installed 24 clocks, and is still planning to promote the installation.

Ten: Conclusion

Public utilities are not only related to people's daily lives, but also essential for urban prosperity. In any area, if there is nothing of water, electricity, gas, telephone, and vehicle transportation, people's lives will experience what kind of inconvenience; and if the equipment is complete and the supply is sufficient, people's lives will experience what kind of convenience. Public utilities have a huge power to attract population and are an important condition for creating urban prosperity. The reason why Shanghai's  is superior to the rest of the country is that the development of its public utilities should be regarded as a major factor.

Furthermore, Shanghai's most important facility is the construction of the port. I am honored to be the convener of the drafting plan for the Shanghai Permanent Port Affairs Agency. This plan has been approved by the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee for three  and will soon be submitted to the central government, hoping to be realized as soon as possible. As for the current work, the first priority should be to expand power, conserve waste, and increase industrial production; the second priority should be to improve water supply in western Shanghai and complete the western Shanghai water plant; the third priority should be to expand the Wusong gas plant to transfer gas to residents in Nanshi; the fourth priority should be to increase public vehicles to facilitate people's "travel"; and the fifth priority should be to fully supply other public utilities in a coordinated manner. Since taking over the matter, I have gathered experts to study it together, focusing on both short-term and long-term solutions, and starting to promote it in order to meet the needs of the public and develop urban planning, with "rationalization", "enterprise", and "massization" as the goals, and proceeding step by step. All of this is a major topic for the present, and it requires the cooperation of all citizens to make the greatest effort to achieve success.

### The Abdication Edict of Emperor Xuantong

When the Qing Emperor abdicated, the abdication edict for Xuantong was written by the Number One Scholar, Nantong Zhang Jian. The full text is as follows:

"We, by the grace of Empress Dowager Longyu's decree, due to the uprising of the people's army and the response of the provinces, the nine summers are boiling and the people are suffering. We specially ordered Yuan Shikai to send officials to discuss the overall situation with representatives of the Republic, to discuss the opening of a parliament, and to decide on the form of government. For two months, there has been no definite solution. The north and south are separated and hold each other in check. Merchants are stranded on the road and soldiers are exposed in the fields. It is only because the form of government has not been decided for a day that the people's livelihood is uneasy for a day. Now, the psychology of the people throughout the country mostly leans towards the republic. The provinces in the south have already advocated concessions, and the generals in the north also advocate them. The will of the people is known, and the mandate of heaven is knowable. How can I bear to use the honor of one family to reject the preferences of the people? Therefore, looking at the overall situation and examining the feelings, I specially led the emperor to return the ruling power to the whole country, and decided on a republic and constitutional form of government, to comfort the hearts of the people at home who are tired of war and hope for governance, and to reach the meaning of the ancient sages who regarded the world as public. Yuan Shikai was previously elected by the Consultative Assembly as Prime Minister. At this time of transition, there should be a way to unify the north and south. Yuan Shikai will organize a provisional government to negotiate unification methods with the people's army, so that the people can live in peace and the sea can be peaceful. The five races of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan will still unite, with complete territory, into a great Republic of China. I and the emperor feel that we can retire to a comfortable and leisurely life, spend our years leisurely, receive the courteous treatment of the people for a long time, and personally witness the completion of the national rule. Isn't that wonderful? This is my order!"

At that time, he was forced by the situation, and although he said "can retire to a comfortable and leisurely life", "Isn't that Wonderful", but once he was lured by the Japanese, he became furious and became a puppet. Pu Yi was indeed ridiculous and pathetic. Anecdotes of National Day
