[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] U.S. President Truman's Special Envoy to China, Marshal George C. Marshall, carrying a personal letter from Chairman Chiang to the U.S. President, departed Beijing at 8:15 AM on the 8th aboard a C-54 Skymaster for his return to the United States. He was accompanied by his personal aide, Colonel K. C. Koier, and others. Chairman and Madam Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan T.V. Soong, Minister Wang Shih-chieh, Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, Minister Yu Ta-wei, Military Counselor Pi Tsung-kan, Secretary-General Huang Jen-lin, CCP representatives Wang Ping-nan and Chang Wen-chin, U.S. Ambassador John Leighton Stuart, U.S. Counselor Walter S. Robertson, Information Officer Connors, and about thirty other Chinese and foreign journalists saw him off at the large airport. The atmosphere at the airport today was filled with poignant farewells. Minister Wang Shih-chieh arrived at the airport as early as 7:30 AM. President Soong T.V., Chief of General Staff Chen, Ambassador Stuart, and Yu Ta-wei also arrived in succession. They paced around the tarmac, silent and pensive. At 7:50 AM, Marshal Marshall arrived in a five-star car, wearing a light yellow military coat, five-star epaulets, and a military cap. At this moment of parting, his face also showed signs of reluctance. As soon as he got out of the car, he was surrounded by the well-wishers at the airport, shaking hands with each of them. He also had a long conversation with President Soong, Minister Wang, Chief of General Staff Chen, and Ambassador Stuart in a corner of the airport. After the conversation, he cordially shook hands with the staff of the nearby airport terminal. Marshal Marshall also bid farewell to Lao Chang, the Chinese driver who drove his five-star car. Shortly after, Chairman and Madam Chiang arrived at the airport. Marshal Marshall immediately stepped forward, took off his hat, and shook hands with them. Chairman Chiang wished Marshal Marshall a safe journey, which was translated by Military Counselor Pi Tsung-kan. After talking for about five minutes, Marshal Marshall boarded the plane. Chairman Chiang also boarded the plane to bid farewell to his old friend and personally handed him a letter to be delivered to President Truman. Chairman Chiang left the plane after about three minutes, while Marshal Marshall stood by the door to see him off. At 8:15 AM, the propellers started turning, and the special envoy for peace, who had been in China for thirteen months, took off and flew towards the northeast.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Less than half an hour after Marshal Marshall left Beijing, it was learned here that Washington had announced his appointment as Secretary of State to succeed James F. Byrnes. All parties were extremely pleased that a friend familiar with the Chinese situation was appointed to this position.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th, United Press] Secretary of State James F. Byrnes has resigned, effective January 10th. President Truman has announced the appointment of General George C. Marshall as his successor. [Caption: On the right is Byrnes, on the left is Marshall]

[United Press, Guam, 8th] Special Envoy Marshall arrived here today aboard a special plane en route to Washington. He made a brief stopover and appeared to be in good spirits. However, he remained silent about the policy direction he would take after assuming the post of Secretary of State. When asked whether he would follow the general policies of his predecessor, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Marshal Marshall smiled and said, "It would be foolish to answer such a question at this time." Marshal Marshall heard the news of his new appointment via the plane's radio. However, he stated, "I had discussed this matter with the President and knew that an announcement was forthcoming."

Byrnes' Sudden Resignation Shakes Washington's Diplomatic Circles

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] The resignation of Secretary of State James F. Byrnes has been regarded by diplomatic, political, and congressional circles here as a bombshell. Members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives expressed regret over Byrnes' departure but also expressed dissatisfaction with the President's appointment of Marshall as his successor. It is generally expected that Congress will approve the appointment. Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg was the first to express regret over the resignation of the exceptionally talented Byrnes, considering it a great loss. At the same time, he welcomed Marshall, who is trusted by Congress, and wished him success. Former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tom Connally, also praised Byrnes highly. Some observers also noted that Marshall has a high chance of becoming President, because according to the Constitution, if President Truman were to leave office for any reason, the Vice President would succeed him. Currently, there is no Vice President (Truman himself rose from Vice President to President), so the Secretary of State would be the next in line.

### Marshall's China Policy Unchanged After Taking Office; Minister Peng States in Press Conference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Marshal Marshall's statement has attracted great attention from all sides. Minister Peng stated at a press conference on the afternoon of the 8th, "Marshal Marshall made this statement in a sincere and friendly spirit, and I read it in the same spirit. He also said that Marshal Marshall had discussed many of the points with him. When reporters asked when Marshal Marshall had discussed them with him, Peng replied, "He has discussed them several times," but did not specify the dates. Peng expressed pleasure at Marshall's appointment as Secretary of State and denied that Marshall's return to the United States would lead to a worsening of the conflict with the Communists. He stated, "We admire Marshal Marshall's efforts in China over the past year and acknowledge President Truman's description of Marshal Marshall's various achievements. Marshal Marshall's promotion to U.S. Secretary of State shows that the U.S. and we share the same views. As for the question of whether Marshal Marshall's return to the United States will lead to a worsening of the CCP's situation, I do not understand how the two are related. The Chinese government's policy will not change because of Marshal Marshall's promotion to Secretary of State. Regarding the progress of the government reorganization and discussions with various parties, Peng said that the government is working hard to implement the reorganization and that progress is good, but there is no concrete news to announce.

### Ambassador Stuart Declares: Denies Retirement

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Ambassador Stuart stated on the 8th that he has no intention of retiring and that rumors that he will submit his resignation after Marshal Marshall returns to the United States are inaccurate. The Communist Party Maintains Silence.

### Wang Shih-chieh Expresses Gratification

The Communist Party Maintains Silence

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Wang Shih-chieh expressed gratification upon hearing of Marshal Marshall's new post as U.S. Secretary of State.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Communist Party spokesman Mei Yi remained silent on the matter of Marshal Marshall's appointment as U.S. Secretary of State and his statement, expressing no opinion. Marshall Will Make Greater Contributions.

### U.S. China Policy

Marshall Will Make Greater Contributions

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th, United Press] Marshall will be better able to guide U.S. policy toward China in the future. Well-informed sources believe that he has been making continuous efforts to achieve this goal and that he may be able to work on a broader plan through remote control than when he was in China.

### Byrnes Jokes: Leaving Office is a Joyful Event

Will Return to Hometown for Recuperation

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] When asked about his feelings about resigning at a White House banquet last night, Byrnes quipped, "A politician has two happy days in his life: the first is the day he is elected, and the second is the day he retires." Byrnes continued, stating that he plans to take a long vacation in his hometown of Spartanburg, South Carolina.

### Lei Chen Returns to Nanjing

Chang Chih-chung's Trip to Nanjing is for Reporting on Duties

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Minister Peng stated at a press conference on the afternoon of the 8th that Chang Chih-chung's trip to Nanjing was purely for reporting on his duties and that there have been no recent changes in the situation in Xinjiang Province.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Since arriving in Shanghai on the evening of the 4th, Lei Chen has been in contact with people from various parties every day, conveying the government's sincerity in hoping that people from various parties will participate and complete constitutional preparations as soon as possible, and in its determination to resume peace talks. He also inquired about the opinions of various parties. It is now learned that Lei has completed his mission and returned to Nanjing by military plane at 10:00 PM last night (the 8th) to report the results of this trip to the government. Unless there is a special need, Lei will no longer come to Shanghai. The work of contacting various parties will continue to be handled by Chang Chün.

[Our Dispatch] Luo Long-chi met with Lei Chen on the 6th to exchange views on the current situation. Luo strongly argued against the feasibility of reorganizing the government, believing that this move would close the door to negotiations. He jokingly used the example of hosting a banquet: the good dishes have been eaten, and the host wants to serve leftovers to the guests, making them nominally present. Even foolish guests would not participate.

### Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Situation; The Government is Paying Close Attention; Minister Peng Says It is Constantly Improving

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Minister Peng declared on the afternoon of the 8th that Shanghai is the nerve center of the country's economic life and that the government is paying special attention to the industrial and commercial situation there. Peng made this statement in response to a reporter's question about "what countermeasures the government is taking against the banking and industrial crisis." It is said that the government believes that there will be no major turmoil in the industrial and commercial sectors. President Roosevelt said that the most fearful thing is fear. Our country has suffered tremendous damage during and after the war, and there are difficult economic reconstruction problems. There are few shortcuts other than long-term efforts and hard work and thrift. Before major problems are solved, the government must maintain the existing agricultural, industrial, commercial, and transportation industries and constantly improve them. Every day, we must fight against rumor-mongers, speculators, and hoarders. New problems arise every day and must be properly resolved, and the advantages and disadvantages must be weighed to make decisive and forceful decisions. Many measures have been taken in the past, and we must continue to work tirelessly in the future.

### All Members of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly Are Grateful for Marshal Marshall's Hard Work; Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu Issue a Joint Statement

[Our Dispatch] Marshal George C. Marshall was summoned to return to the United States from China the day before yesterday and was honorably appointed as U.S. Secretary of State. All circles in this city have expressed regret at Marshal Marshall's departure. A reporter specifically inquired about the feelings of several local leaders. According to Speaker Pan Kung-chan and Deputy Speaker Hsu Chi-ch'ing, they jointly told reporters: "Marshal George C. Marshall was sent to China by President Truman at the end of the year before last. Except for a return to the United States last March to report on his duties, his efforts for China's peaceful reunification lasted for a year, and his hard work and painstaking efforts were witnessed by all of us. Although Marshal Marshall's efforts to promote peace talks were obstructed and sabotaged by extremists and have not yet been fully successful, the Political Consultative Conference had already passed the 'Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction,' and the government and the Communist Party had agreed to and signed the plan for the reorganization and integration of the army. Moreover, the convocation of the National Assembly and the drafting of the democratic constitution were completed by the government at the end of last year, following the principles of the Political Consultative Conference, and were announced on New Year's Day this year. All this, China is moving towards the great road of democratic constitutionalism and peaceful reunification. We are all happy to see the correctness of the policies adopted by the government, but we also know that this is all the result of Marshal Marshall's patience and efforts in China over the past year. Marshal Marshall has been summoned back to the United States this time to assume a new mission, which is important. He left in a hurry and was unable to pass through Shanghai. We were unable to shake hands with him to say goodbye, which is very regrettable. All members of the Municipal Assembly must be grateful for Marshal Marshall's hard work during his stay in China and are especially confident that his assumption of responsibility for the diplomacy of the Allied countries will further contribute to the strengthening of Sino-American relations and the maintenance of world peace. We respectfully express this sentiment to wish Marshal Marshall a healthy journey and success in his mission."

Furthermore, according to people close to diplomatic circles, Marshal Marshall's departure can be said to be a good phenomenon for both the current domestic situation and future U.S. policy towards China. At a time when reactionary elements are fiercely anti-American, Marshal Marshall's return to the United States may also reduce the severity of the anti-American movement.

Feng Yu-chih, a representative of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai, expressed the following thoughts: "Marshal Marshall has worked for China's peaceful reunification for more than a year, and his spirit and contributions are truly appreciated by us. It may be a fact that the United States hopes for peace in China, which is also beneficial to them, but the U.S. government and people certainly do not want to see their friendly country fall into a state of pain and unrest. Although Marshal Marshall's return to the United States will not interrupt the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it may cause more difficulties due to the lack of an intermediary. Marshal Marshall's purpose in running around was to help promote China's peaceful reunification and achieve a truly democratic country. We can only hope to quickly fulfill his wishes for China to thank Marshal Marshall for his sincerity and hard work over the past year."

### The U.S. Note on the Dalian Issue; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Studying the Reply; China and India are Preparing to Exchange Envoys

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] At the Central Propaganda Department's press conference on the 8th, a reporter asked, "It is reported that the Chinese government has requested the recovery of the Xisha Islands, and it is also reported that the Chinese flag has been flown over the Xisha Islands. What is the truth?"

Yeh Kung-chao, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied: "The Chinese government has recovered the Xisha Islands from Japanese occupation. Sovereignty over these islands belongs to China, so there is no procedure to 'request a recovery' from any party."

Asked, "What is the Chinese government's attitude towards the note from the U.S. government regarding Dalian? Also, what procedures will the Chinese government take to take over Dalian?" Yeh replied, "The Chinese government has received the U.S. government's note regarding Dalian. Its content is generally the same as that reported in the newspaper. Regarding the legal status of Dalian, I have expressed my opinion previously and have nothing to add today." Asked, "The Chinese and Indian governments have agreed to upgrade their offices to embassies. Will the Chinese and Indian governments discuss the establishment of consulates?"

Yeh replied, "The Chinese and Indian governments agreed on October 22nd of last year to upgrade each other's commissioner's offices to embassies. Currently, both governments are preparing to send envoys. Our country has already established consulates in India, while the Indian government recently preliminarily established a consulate in Shanghai."

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 8th] Yeh Kung-chao declared: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying the reply to the U.S. note on the Dalian issue. There are currently no changes in the situation in Dalian." London Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Said

### Britain Hopes for the Opening of Dalian

London Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Said

[United Press, London, 7th] The British Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman declared today: "Regarding the Dalian issue, although Britain has not followed the United States in issuing a note to the Soviet Union requesting the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, it very much hopes that the port can be fully opened and become a true free port for world trade." Britain did not have any contact with the U.S. State Department when it issued the note to the Soviet government.

### Full Text of Marshal Marshall's Statement on Leaving China

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 7th] General George C. Marshall, President Truman's Special Envoy to China, today made a frank report to the American people, stating: "The greatest obstacle to peace in China is the mutual suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party." General Marshall, who was immediately summoned back to the United States by the President to report on the situation in China, continued: "Efforts to achieve reconciliation in good faith have been repeatedly obstructed by extremists on both sides." He said that in his view, the way to "save the situation" lies in the group of liberal elements from all parties working under Chairman Chiang's leadership taking practical steps to implement China's recently adopted democratic constitution.

According to the State Department, Marshal Marshall's message to the American people, who are deeply concerned about developments in the Far East, reads as follows:

"The President recently issued a comprehensive report on all developments in China over the past year, as well as the U.S. government's position on China. The current environment requires me to supplement this with my initial impressions.

During my negotiations to promote peace and a democratic government in China, there were several issues that I considered more important. In this complex and chaotic situation, I will only address those more important issues.

First, the greatest obstacle to peace is the mutual suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

On the one hand, the government leaders are firmly opposed to organizing a communist government. On the other hand, the Communists frankly stated that they are Marxists and, although they will first go through a government based on the Anglo-American type of democracy, they still seek to establish a communist government in China.

The government leaders believe that the CCP's willingness to participate in the government stipulated by the Political Consultative Conference in January of last year is purely for destructive purposes. I believe that CCP members deeply feel that the government has no sincerity in implementing the PCC resolutions to form a new government. CCP members also believe that the government intends to eliminate the Communist Party through the threat of military force and the actions of the secret police. In addition to this strong mutual distrust, there is also an obvious mistake on both sides, namely, ignoring the impact of this fear on the other party's consideration of certain suggestions or reasons for opposition in negotiations. Both sides are trying to eliminate their own fears. Therefore, both sides are prejudiced against the other party's position and are wary of every suggestion or possibility. The chaotic news from the remote and vast military conflict front lines has further deepened this error. Skirmishes are often deliberately distorted as large-scale offensives. Both sides use distortions to slander the other. I can only rely on the reports of American officers in the Executive Headquarters teams to get a glimpse of the truth, and there are so many incidents in such a vast area that American personnel feel overwhelmed. I would like to mention the outstanding courage and bravery of the U.S. military and Marines in overcoming great obstacles to strive for peace in China.

I believe that the most important factors in the recent breakdown of negotiations are as follows: The most powerful group in the National Government (in fact, the Kuomintang) opposed almost all my efforts to promote a true coalition government. This opposition is often disguised as political or party actions, but the Kuomintang is the government, so its actions, although not direct, are very powerful. They openly and frankly declared that the cooperation of the CCP is unimaginable and that only a military policy can solve the problem. This group includes both military and political leaders.

On the CCP side, I believe there are radical elements and also liberal elements, but many people strongly oppose this view, believing that the CCP's party discipline is strict and that such different views are not allowed within a party. But in my opinion, there is indeed a group of liberal elements within the Communist Party, especially among the youth. They lean towards the Communist Party because they hate the corruption of the local government, but they value the interests of the Chinese people even more than the reckless measures to immediately establish a communist government. As for the truly extreme communists, they will not hesitate to use any radical means to achieve their goals, such as destroying transportation in order to destroy China's economy and create a situation conducive to overthrowing the government, regardless of the direct suffering of the people. They completely distrust the leaders of the Kuomintang. They seem to believe that every proposal made by the government is used to defeat the Communist Party. The crowd riots in February and March of last year, which were clearly instigated (some of which occurred only a few houses away from where I was negotiating), gave the Communist Party a good excuse to make their suspicions reasonable.

### Detailed Measures for Sentence Reduction; May Be Announced in the Short Term

Minister Peng Answers Reporters' Questions Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] At the Central Propaganda Department's reception, a reporter asked, "Are there any political prisoners detained in China? If so, what impact will the recently announced amnesty have on them?" Minister Peng replied, "The Minister of Justice stated this morning that the amnesty decree is divided into two parts: (1) amnesty and (2) sentence reduction. The amnesty part has been effective since the date of publication in the National Government Gazette, and courts at all levels can handle it independently according to the law. The sentence reduction part is more complicated, and the detailed implementation measures are being drafted by the Judicial Yuan in conjunction with the Executive Yuan and will be announced and implemented in the short term. There are no purely political prisoners detained in the government-controlled areas. No one is detained for political beliefs, but no one who has committed a crime will be exempted simply because of their political affiliation."

### Communist Troops Attempt to Threaten Xuzhou: Fierce Fighting Near Yixian and Taierzhuang; National Army Enters Machang Town, Approaching Shuyang

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 8th] Communist troops from the Soviet Border Region have assembled more than several divisions of troops and are fiercely attacking the National Army in the area of He'erzhuang, Yixian, and Zaozhuang. On the evening of the 7th, the Communist troops attacking Yixian once infiltrated the vicinity of the South Gate before being repelled by the National Army stationed there. There was also fierce fighting near Taierzhuang. Communist troops have been discovered at various ferry crossings on the north bank of the Lunan Canal, clearly intending to threaten the outer defenses of Xuzhou. The National Army has provided strong resistance.

[Our Own Dispatch, Xuzhou, 8th] Communist troops are attempting to expand their offensive in southern Shandong and have been moving frequently in recent days. Two divisions of Communist troops from the Gaomi and Anqiu areas have already infiltrated the Xiangcheng and Bianzhuang areas northeast of Yixian via Juxian and Linyi. More than 20,000 Communist troops from northern Jiangsu's Zaoning and Shuyang have infiltrated the suburbs of Jiaocheng. In addition, Pixian reported an emergency on the 7th. The artillery and Longchi National Army units have automatically retreated because their positions were protruding. Fierce fighting continues in the suburbs of Yixian and He'erzhuang.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 8th] The National Army stationed in Nanxin'anzhen entered Machang, which is fifty li from Shuyang, on the morning of the 8th.

[Our Own Dispatch, Zhenjiang, 8th] Military News: The tense situation on the outskirts of Xuzhou has eased. The Communist troops who attacked Miwan again on the 7th were repelled after strong resistance from the National Army. In this battle, the Communist troops attacked Yaowan with three regiments but ultimately suffered over a thousand casualties and retreated in defeat, proving that the National Army's defensive capabilities in northern Jiangsu are not to be trifled with. In addition, since General Wu Jiwei, Deputy Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, personally inspected various lines on the outskirts of Xuzhou, the morale of the National Army has been greatly boosted. To strengthen the defense of northern Jiangsu and reinforce the National Army in northern Anhui, reinforcements have entered their positions, greatly reassuring the people. The Communist troops attacking Huji between Shuyang and Huaiyin retreated in defeat after seven hours of fierce fighting. The Huai-Shu road is now controlled by the National Army's 74th Division. It is rumored that internal strife also broke out within the Shuyang Communist troops yesterday. Due to food shortages, lack of clothing, and insufficient ammunition, many of the Communist troops in the area are unwilling to fight, and major changes are expected soon.

### Intensified Efforts to Block the Huayuankou Breach: Expected Completion by End of Month; Communist Announcement to Build Dam Downstream to Block Water

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th] The Huayuankou breach blocking project is currently being intensified with the dumping of rocks. The water surface is already less than three meters. If the diversion of the river water is smooth, it can be completed as scheduled by the end of this month. The current flow of the old course of the Yellow River is forty cubic meters per second, one-thirtieth of the total flow, with a depth of seven Chinese inches, a width of thirty meters, and a speed of one Chinese li per hour. The water is gradually becoming turbulent. It can reach the vicinity of Lanfeng on the 8th. However, the Chinese Communists, using issues such as the relocation of residents along the riverbed as an excuse, have repeatedly expressed opposition to the blocking. Recently, they have repeatedly raised protests. Zhao Mingfu, the Chinese Communist representative stationed in Bian, has protested to the blocking and restoration engineering bureau and has also gone to Beijing to discuss the matter with Dong Biwu and others, the Chinese Communist representative stationed in Beijing. Various circles in Henan were extremely indignant upon hearing that the Chinese Communists were obstructing the blocking and restoration project. They all believed that the Yellow River flooding had caused a great catastrophe for the people of Henan. If they have even a little humanity, they should not obstruct the blocking and restoration project to save millions of refugees in the flood-stricken areas.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th] The Huayuankou breach blocking project is expected to be closed before the flood season. The news has been met with rejoicing by the people in the flood-stricken areas. However, the "JiluYu Administrative Office" of the Chinese Communists recently issued an announcement stating that it will build a dam downstream to block the flow of water. If the Chinese Communists implement this plan, the north and south banks of the Yellow River could face danger at any time.

### Dong Biwu Arrives in Shanghai: Meeting on Yellow River Issue to be Convened in Shanghai Within Days

[Our City News] The Yellow River issue, which has plagued our country for thousands of years, has recently caused disputes between the government and the Chinese Communists due to the measures taken for the Zhu Kou and levee restoration work. Chinese Communist representative Dong Biwu has arrived in Shanghai by early train yesterday at the invitation of General Egerton, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's China Office, to discuss the matter with relevant parties. At the same time, Yellow River Chief Engineer Tadd will also come to Shanghai from Kaifeng within days to participate in the Yellow River issue meeting. Director Huo Baoshu of the Executive Yuan has gone to Beijing last night to seek instructions. Once Huo returns to Shanghai, the meeting can be convened. Participants will include Director Zheng, General Egerton, Dong Biwu, Engineer Tadd, and representatives of the Water Conservancy Commission. According to Wu Yunfu of the Chinese Communist Party, Dong's biggest demands are three: (1) Postpone the blocking to avoid major flooding in Shandong; (2) Complete the levee restoration work as soon as possible to ensure that the old river course does not flood; (3) Immediately allocate 15 billion to subsidize the people who need to be relocated. According to our government, in order to save more than one million victims in the three provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, and Jiangsu and restore a large area of ​​fertile farmland, it has carried out the first step of the original plan, engaging in the Zhu Kou and levee restoration work, while the Chinese Communist Party insists that the Huayuankou Zhu Kou work must be delayed for another five months before it can be implemented. Wu said: After the water is released on December 27, it is expected that the flood will reach Jinan on the 15th of this month, and there will be a major flood in Shandong in late January and early February. It is urgent to seek a solution. The government has approved 66 billion for levee restoration expenses (6 billion has been allocated) and 15 billion for relief expenses (it has agreed to allocate two-thirds first). The total length of the Yellow River on both sides is 1900 kilometers, and the construction work is extremely difficult, and there are many problems. It will be after the representatives meet in Shanghai.

According to Wu, according to the reporter of this newspaper: The number of residents in the old course area who should be transferred reaches 350,777, of which 263,083 need to be rescued.

### Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense Talks: No War Near Dalian; Landing of National Army on Dachangshan Island is Groundless

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] When answering questions from reporters from this agency today, the military spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said: There has been much speculation about the military situation near Dalian, and the press has been spreading false information. The Shanghai Wenhui Bao reprinted a telegram from the Associated Press in Beiping on the 5th, stating that the National Army launched its first landing battle in Northeast China and captured Dachangshan Island and Haiyang Island, sixty miles northeast of Dalian, etc. According to investigations, the National Army north of Dalian is north of Pulandian and has not advanced. The National Army in the eastern area is west of Zhuanghe and has not come into contact with the Communist Army. As for the area of governing the sea, only a small number of coastal defense ships are patrolling and maintaining order. There is no landing on Dachangshan Island and Haiyang Island. I hope Gujie is not deceived by rumors.

[Our Own Dispatch, Shenyang, 8th] Reporters have been inspecting the periphery of Dalian for several days. Some chimneys of the Anshan Steel Plant have been smoking.

### Full Text of the Malaysian Ambassador's Statement on Leaving China: Continued from Page 1

The most literate and inflammatory stage in the Communist program is the propaganda text. I would like to tell the American people: This food propaganda is completely devoid of truth and facts, and it deliberately misinterprets and destroys the policies and will of our government. All kinds of facts are sufficient to prove that the main goal of this propaganda is to deceive the people of China and the world and to arouse their hatred of the United States. It is difficult for us to remain silent about this act of public slander and disregard for the facts. However, after one denial, it is necessary to deny it every day, which is a kind of work that American members can hardly tolerate. Speaking fairly, although the news publishing institutions of the National Government do not have the county nature of Communist Party propaganda, there are also many erroneous reports. The statement issued by the Chinese Communist Party regarding the Anping incident is especially pure fabrication. As a result of the Anping incident, three Marine Corps soldiers were killed and twelve were injured. This incident was the result of a planned ambush and interception. The victims were several Marine Corps transport units transporting supplies and some general materials to the Executive Headquarters. The report from the Chinese Communist Party said that the incident was caused by the defensive attack by the Marine Corps. The investigation into this incident was also a story of procrastination in order to cover up the truth of this incident and privately acknowledge the facts.

Extremists on both sides have repeatedly frustrated sincere efforts to reach a solution. The agreement reached at the Political Consultative Conference a year ago was a free and grand charter, and this charter laid the foundation for China's peace and revival. However, the uncompromising people in the Kuomintang wanted to maintain their own feudal control over China, and they obviously had no sincerity in adhering to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Although I am speaking out as a soldier, I regret that I have opened up to the military's dominance. The military support has made the strength of the Chinese government increasingly weak. At the same time, people with similar sentiments in Xiangzhai must firmly remember: it is not the work of a small number of Communist Party groups or committees (this kind of work is also commonplace for us in the United States), but the movements of tens of thousands of people and more than 1 million soldiers.

I have never been able to determine the evolution of the Communist Party's internal attitude. The road followed by the Chinese Communist Party in recent months shows that they are unwilling to promote a fair compromise, which is the most certain thing. It is also impossible to promote talks between representatives of the Chinese Communist Party and the government. The Chinese Communist Party has now put forward its final demands, which have led to the breakdown of negotiations. They specifically demanded the dissolution of the National Assembly and the restoration of the military status on January 13, which were unacceptable to the government.

Between the reactionaries and the uncompromising Communist Party who occupy a dominant position in the government (I must state that the Communist Party did not express such uncompromising views in February), there is now a question: How to make the peace and happiness of the Chinese people, who have suffered and are currently in a divided stage, a reality. The reactionaries in the government apparently believed that no matter what they did, they would be able to obtain the help of the United States. The Communist Party is unwilling to compromise for the interests of the country. They believe that the economic collapse will bring down the government, and they deeply advocate widespread guerrilla warfare along the railway lines, which will accelerate the collapse of the government, and disregard the suffering of the Chinese people.

Based on my observations, the only way to save this situation is to have the free members and minority parties in the government take the lead. The minority parties are a collection of outstanding people, but they still lack the political power to implement control. I believe that under the leadership of Chairman , such groups, if they can work together to promote their work, will surely achieve the goal of unity through a good government.

In fact, the National Assembly has already formulated a democratic constitution, the main parts of which are in line with the original intentions decided by the political consultative conference of various parties in January last year. Unfortunately, the Communist Party failed to think that it could participate in this conference, and the constitution passed by the conference seems to include their main requirements.

The Chinese government will soon carry out major reorganizations, and elections will be completed and the constitution will be implemented before the 1947 Saint . Now that the form of democratic China has been laid down by the newly revised constitution, the actual steps will become a trial. As for the extent to which the government can sincerely welcome all parties to actively assume government responsibilities and work to enrich the form of democratic China, it remains to be seen.

The first step will be to reorganize the National Government Committee and the administrative departments of the government pending the implementation of the constitution. The method of implementing the reorganization and the number of representative seats for free members and non-Kuomintang members will be of great importance. We also hope that during this transitional period, the Communist Party or other groups will still have the opportunity to participate in the government and jointly assume responsibility for China's future.

The period of training under the rule of the Kuomintang has come to an end, and this has already been formally stated on record. If the political rule of one party truly ends, then the Kuomintang should stop receiving government funding.

What I have said is frank and unreserved, because only in this way can I hope that the American people will understand this complicated issue. I have expressed this view during the negotiations, and I believe that most of the individuals involved are already aware of it. I am making it public now because it is my duty to present my estimates of this situation and all its possibilities to the Americans who are deeply concerned about all developments in the Far East.

Editorial

### Sending General Marshall Back Home

General Marshall, the special envoy of U.S. President Truman, took a five-star marshal's private plane yesterday morning to leave China and return home. Special Envoy Marshall originally went to report to President Truman in person; however, one and a half hours after General Marshall left our capital, news came from the United States reporting that President Truman had nominated General Marshall as Secretary of State, succeeding Byrnes. At the same time, General Marshall's original intention to issue a statement on the Chinese situation after arriving in the U.S. capital was also advanced and released after the general left Beijing. The rapid development of this situation, unfolding to such a high degree in such a short period of time, was truly beyond the expectations of ordinary people. This is truly like the dropping of an atomic bomb; we, who are directly affected by this atomic bomb, truly do not know how to express our feelings.

First of all, we cannot but express our heartfelt gratitude to General Marshall. Over the past year, General Marshall, in the capacity of President Truman's special envoy, has tirelessly worked for the unification and peace of China, his efforts untiring. This spirit has moved every kind Chinese person. General Marshall's efforts in China have not failed. Because of his efforts, we have seen the convening of the "Political Consultative Conference" and the resolutions it established, especially the resolution on the unified reorganization of the army. This was supported by both the government and the Communist Party. Although the unified reorganization has not yet been fully realized, the establishment of this agreement alone is sufficient to indicate General Marshall's success in China. Moreover, the Constitution of the Republic of China passed by this National Assembly has also been greatly influenced by General Marshall's inspiration. This constitution is a crystallization of all parties not adhering to their prejudices and is a good manifestation of the spirit of tolerance. What the Chinese people should be forever grateful for is that the making of this constitution coincided with General Marshall's stay in China. The manifestation of this spirit of tolerance was undoubtedly due in part to General Marshall's inspiration. On this point alone, General Marshall's contributions to the Chinese people are sufficient to be known for all time. When the general flew to Shanghai and went to Beijing to take office on December 20th of last year, this newspaper wrote a welcoming editorial, which contained the sentence: "At present, the enemy has surrendered, and it is precisely the time for us to actively build the country. Our great ally has specially sent an envoy like Marshal Marshall to China, which truly makes us think of the past when France, which had the same ideals of nation-building as the United States, sent an outstanding military and political figure to the United States at the beginning of the founding of the United States. We hope that the influence of Marshal Marshall's visit to China on the Chinese people will be as great as the influence of Lafayette on the American people." Now that the Constitution of China is imprinted with the spirit of General Marshall, it can stand alongside the Republic of China for thousands of years. Not only is our wish not in vain, but it is also sufficient to show General Marshall's success in China. Now that the general is leaving China and returning home, we cannot help but feel reluctant to part.

Secondly, what we want to say is to congratulate General Marshall on his new appointment. General Marshall will go to serve as the U.S. Secretary of State. President Truman's decision to entrust this responsibility to Marshal Marshall at this time is the wisest decision. Since the death of the late President Roosevelt, American politics has suddenly lost its center of gravity. President Truman, with his extraordinary talent, at an extraordinary time, assumed an extraordinary responsibility. His situation was difficult, as everyone knows. Because he has extraordinary talent, he can use his extraordinary wisdom, so since he assumed his extraordinary responsibility, he has been able to handle himself well in various contradictions. The Secretary of State is responsible for negotiation and compromise, especially after the war, when American diplomacy is admired by all countries. Byrnes also had extraordinary talent and assumed the extraordinary responsibility of Secretary of State; since taking office, he has made many contributions to the implementation of American national policy, which aroused dissatisfaction among young politicians. We then saw attacks by figures like former Secretary of Commerce Wallace. This attack not only greatly affected Byrnes, who was in the position of Secretary of State, but also greatly affected the prestige of the United States itself. Fortunately, President Truman made a wise decision and dismissed the Secretary of Commerce. Although this somewhat salvaged the reputation of the United States, the wounds of Wallace's attack have not yet fully healed. Last year, the Republican Party also raised its head in Congress. At this time, President Truman had no choice but to let the meritorious Byrnes retire. And at this time, there is no one else who can take on the position of Secretary of State other than General Marshall. Why do we say this? Now the administrative head of the United States is President Truman, who belongs to the Democratic Party; but the Democratic Party can no longer control the U.S. Congress, the highest legislative body - the Republican Party has been able to control Congress as a result of the last election. The first thing the American people care about now is diplomacy, and the second is domestic politics. Byrnes, who belongs to the Democratic Party, cannot but seek to leave at this time; and his successor must be a non-partisan figure, and at the same time must be able to obtain the unanimous support of the country. Who else could it be other than General Marshall? We express our infinite joy at General Marshall's new appointment. Because at this time, only a person with General Marshall's talent can take on this new appointment. The Chinese people have known General Marshall's outstanding talent for the past year, and with his experience in China over the past year, we firmly believe that General Marshall's new appointment will not only be able to perform his duties happily, but also make Sino-American relations closer. We firmly believe that this five-star marshal, who was able to defeat the Axis with his extraordinary talent, will surely be able to bring lasting peace to the post-war world. We hereby wish the general success in his new mission.

Furthermore, what we cannot but mention is the statement issued by General Marshall upon his departure. In this statement, we can see General Marshall's concern for the Chinese situation and his soldierly frankness. We do not want to comment too much on this statement. Now General Marshall is leaving China and returning home to take on a new appointment. This new appointment will undoubtedly affect the safety and security of the entire era. General Marshall is returning from China and will undoubtedly be able to decide on the actions to be taken from a broader perspective. The development of the Chinese situation to the present stage has its historical background. General Marshall is now in a broader perspective, and we firmly believe that this will be of great benefit to the improvement of the Chinese situation. How to promote Sino-American relations after General Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, General Marshall may already have a plan in mind, but standing in the position of the Chinese people, we are willing to further state our views in another article.

### Flourishing Abandonment of Infants in Chongming: Advocacy for Child Protection Measures

[Our Newspaper, Chongming] The practice of abandoning infants in this county has always been extremely popular. In recent years, with irregular order and difficult living, this practice has become even more rampant. In addition, various infant welfare organizations, either due to financial constraints or lack of competent administrators, cannot properly care for the abandoned infants. Since the beginning of winter, abandoned infants have been found from time to time in fields and on embankment sides, but most of them have been bitten to death by cats and dogs, with incomplete limbs and heads. Before the New Year, someone even hung a basket of three naked infants at the gate of the infant welfare center in the town at night and left them to freeze to death, which was too horrible to bear. It is heard that some people are preparing to draft child protection measures and submit them to the county for implementation. The quota for Wujin County councilors has been allocated, and the Gao You County Temporary Council has closed.

### Ningbo Municipality Establishment Issue: Local Gentry Telegraph the Provincial Government to Postpone Discussion: The People's Hardships Have Not Recovered, and There Are No Conditions for Being Called a Municipality

[Our Newspaper, Ningbo] Regarding the issue of restoring the establishment of Ningbo as a municipality, the province originally planned to restore the establishment this year and sent Chen Zongen, an inspector from the Civil Affairs Department, to Ningbo to delineate the city boundary in conjunction with the Sixth Special District Office and the Zheng County Government and draw detailed diagrams, which were submitted to the province for verification. Now, it is learned that Sun Biaoqing, Zhao Zhishi, Zhang Zhongzhi and other gentlemen from Ningbo believe that the establishment of Ningbo as a municipality is unnecessary, and they specially telegraphed the provincial government, requesting to postpone the discussion. The original telegram is as follows: "We have learned from newspapers that the proposal to establish Ningbo as a municipality has been approved and will be established soon. The general public is panicked, and informed people know that this is not a good plan. According to the experience in the 16th year of the Republic of China, when it was established once, it was ultimately because various conditions did not meet the standards for establishing a municipality, so the governance was not satisfactory, the results were difficult to speak of, and the people were not able to receive the actual benefits of the municipality, and they could not bear the burden of government expenses. The central government, in view of this, immediately ordered the abolition. The loss of the previous vehicle is not far away. After the disaster, the wounds have not healed, the people's hardships have not recovered, and the maintenance and care of the trees are still needed, and the livelihood needs to be restored. How can we change the governance institutions and increase the burden on the people? After the war, there was much destruction, the refugees have not returned, the people's livelihood is exhausted, all the conditions that can be called a city, the construction of public facilities, the burden of financial resources, are not only not better than before the 16th year, and the railway has not been restored, the highway has not been repaired, the maritime atmosphere is not peaceful, the number of ships has decreased, the transportation is difficult, the rural areas are bankrupt, the high interest rates are oppressed, the industry and commerce are collapsing, the unemployment is increasing, the housing is in a panic, compared with the situation when the city was established in the 16th year, the general financial resources of the people are even less than one thousandth of the past. If the city is established again, the number of institutions will increase, the organization will be large, and the people's financial burden will be unbearable. We have observed this situation and believe that it is unnecessary for Ningbo to establish a municipality at present. Therefore, we telegraphed to your Excellency for verification, and we hope that you will temporarily postpone the discussion in order to reduce the burden on the people. It is for your convenience."

### Future Diplomatic Trends of the United States Closely Watched by All Countries in the World; British Labor Party to Conduct New Review of Bevin's Policies

[United Press, London, 8th] British government officials were shocked when news of the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and the succession of Marshall reached here. It is heard that Foreign Secretary Bevin and Prime Minister Attlee will hold further talks to discuss the impact of Marshall's appointment as Secretary of State on U.S. foreign policy, especially regarding the situation in Palestine and what policy Marshall will adopt.

[United Press, London, 8th] Sources here say that Marshall's succession to Byrnes as Secretary of State can be seen as a rightward shift in U.S. foreign policy. Britain is anxiously awaiting Moscow's negative reaction, as Moscow has recently severely criticized U.S. policies, accusing them of "imperialist aims" throughout the Pacific region. Conversely, the Soviet government has always valued military leaders and may therefore react favorably to Marshall.

[Associated Press, London, 7th] The British Labor Party announced today that the party will hold a series of informal meetings across the country starting in February to inform members of the government's foreign policy. Foreign Secretary Bevin and other cabinet ministers will give speeches. Since the Labor Party discovered a number of dissident members at the end of last year, the party leader has launched an "education" campaign, and next month's lecture will be the latest step.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] Diplomatic circles here expect that the new U.S. Secretary of State Marshall will continue to improve U.S.-Soviet relations. News of Byrnes's resignation was met with surprise here. It was generally believed that although Byrnes's resignation was possible after the Republican election victory, his achievements in drafting treaties with Germany's former satellite states and consulting with Republican senators on matters of national interest had greatly strengthened his position. His resignation now is likely a political competition of parties, and the Democratic Party intends to retain him.

### Marshal Montgomery Busy with Receptions in the Soviet Union; To Meet Stalin Tomorrow

[Reuters, Moscow, 7th] British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery today visited the Voroshilov Military Academy, where Soviet military officers explained the techniques of Red Army training in detail.

During the banquet, Marshal Montgomery responded to the welcoming remarks of the Soviet generals, emphasizing the need for Britain and the Soviet Union to maintain good relations. Today is the Russian Christmas, and Marshal Konev and other famous generals accompanied him to watch a dance performance in the evening.

According to a United Press report, Marshal Montgomery is scheduled to stay in the Soviet Union for four days, and Stalin will host Marshal Montgomery at the Kremlin on the 10th.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 7th] Responsible parties announced today that Marshal Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union is intended to make the Soviet authorities understand that any military agreement between Britain and the United States does not exclude other countries from participating. Marshal Montgomery will declare that Britain welcomes the Soviet Union to participate in such agreements under the auspices of the United Nations. Soviet commentators have criticized the British and American plans to standardize their military equipment and training programs.

### Security Council Discusses General Disarmament Proposal

Trieste Issue Still to Be Decided

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] The Security Council today adjourned the discussion on the issue of placing the Port of Trieste under United Nations administration. The Australian representative questioned the legality of the plan, while the Belgian representative requested further study. It is expected that the approval of the plan is only a formality, but the major powers are not pressing for a vote due to this unexpected opposition. However, the plan must receive seven votes in favor to take effect. The Security Council is scheduled to discuss the major issue of general disarmament again on the 8th.

### Corfu Channel Incident

Not Yet Submitted to Security Council

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 7th] Regarding the British government's plan to include the issue of Albania placing mines in the Corfu Strait on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council, the British delegation has not yet received instructions from the government, but it is heard that two experts from the British Admiralty are now in New York waiting to serve as advisors to the British representative, Sir Alexander Cadogan, when the matter is submitted to the Security Council for discussion.

### Antarctic Conference Not Likely to Be Convened Soon

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Byrnes, in his final appearance as Secretary of State, attended an intelligence conference and expressed a cold attitude towards a suggestion to immediately convene an international conference to study the territorial claims made by at least nine countries on Antarctica, explaining that the situation in Antarctica is not urgent and that there are many other political conferences that need to be held, so it is not necessary to convene this international conference immediately.

It is also learned that Norway and New Zealand are now paying close attention to the development of the Antarctic situation. The Prime Minister of New Zealand is also arousing the interest of Britain and Australia, intending to send an expedition to establish a scientific station for long-term research.

### Representatives from China and the Soviet Union Also Appointed to the Greek Border Investigation Group

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 7th] The United Nations Security Council plans to organize an investigation committee to conduct on-site investigations in the Balkans.

### French Paratroopers Land in Nam Dinh to Rescue Besieged French Troops; Only the Use of Force Can Resolve the Vietnam Incident

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 8th] The French Minister for Overseas Territories, Moutet, left here by air to return to France today, accompanied by his son, Gustave, and entourage, after inspecting Vietnam.

[United Press, Paris, 7th] The French Colonial Minister, Moutet, who went to Vietnam to conduct an on-site investigation, is scheduled to depart for France tomorrow. He gave a radio speech in Saigon today, stating that the conflict in Vietnam is a large-scale war and that his mission has failed. Only military force can restore order. Mr. Moutet said, "I came here to carry out peaceful work, but unexpectedly, what I saw was a large-scale war. If we want to regain security, France must continue military operations. We have been attacked, we are now defending ourselves, and we will never be subdued by riots."

French military commander in Vietnam, General Leclerc, reiterated the battle results and claimed that the French army is expanding the "safe zone," but Leclerc also admitted that a small number of French troops defending near Nam Dinh are under siege by Viet Minh troops and are fighting independently.

[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] The French General Staff announced today that French paratroopers landed successfully near Nam Dinh, 80 miles southeast of Hanoi, on a moonlit night. They immediately occupied a bridgehead on the Red River to relieve the Europeans trapped in the local textile factory and to clear out the Viet Minh troops in the city. Other French troops want to relieve the siege of Hanoi and are advancing eastward to join forces with the French troops fighting west of the seawall.

[Reuters, Saigon, 7th] Although war has not been declared between France and Vietnam, the French military staff in Hanoi has been fully mobilized in accordance with a state of war. News today said that two teams of French mechanized units advanced east and west from Hanoi and Haiphong and joined forces on the highway between the two cities, but the French believe that this achievement may not last long. General Leclerc also said that the French army has gradually been able to control the situation in Hanoi and Haiphong and is gradually expanding around the two cities.

### French Troops in Hanoi Eat Dog Meat to Fill Hunger

[Associated Press, Manila, 7th] A Viet Minh radio broadcast heard here today said that French troops in Hanoi are facing a food shortage. French prisoners captured by the Viet Minh said that some French troops and foreign troops (i.e., former Nazi Germans) had to kill police dogs and Vietnamese dogs to fill their hunger. Hanoi is completely lacking in vegetables. German foreign troops arrived in the Viet Minh Republic in violation of the so-called Franco-Vietnamese Treaty. The radio station also said that the French authorities have agreed to the request of the overseas Chinese to evacuate 50 overseas Chinese from Haiphong every day.

### Nehru Broadcast Condemns French Military Action

[Central News Agency, London, 7th, United Press] Nehru stated in a broadcast to France and the French people that the French military's use of force in Vietnam has reduced its prestige in Asia. He said that India has always had a high regard for France and hopes to cooperate in the cultural field in the future, but India will maintain the independence of all Asian peoples. He said, "We express our deep sympathy for Vietnam."

### Jewish Terrorist Groups Reportedly Cease Activities

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 7th] It is rumored here that the Irgun and Stern Gang terrorist groups have accepted the advice of conciliatory figures and ceased terrorist activities until the British sincerity is tested, but British military headquarters intelligence department says this is not the case. There has been no attack on British troops in Palestine in the past 24 hours, perhaps because of this.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] According to reliable sources, the Palestine problem group conference is scheduled to resume in London on the 21st of this month.

### Truman's Policy Plans Will Encounter Difficulties in Congress; Republicans Oppose Universal Military Training and Insist on Reducing Income Taxes

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman's administrative policies and the Republican Congress are already at odds. This division will widen when the President presents his budget proposal to save the economy from depression and restore prosperity tomorrow afternoon. Currently, the President's plans have sparked the following disputes: (1) The President plans to submit a budget proposal of $37 billion for the next fiscal year, which the Republicans have opposed. It is said that the President's budget message will state that the surplus is less than $1.5 billion, which must be used to pay off the national debt of around $253 billion. Most Republicans say that strict austerity measures could reduce income taxes by 20% and still reduce the national debt. (2) Most members of Congress have paid little attention to the President's proposal to establish a 20-member committee to investigate ways to prevent strikes. (3) The President's proposal to merge the Army and Navy Departments seems to have a chance for further review in the new Congress. However, there is general opposition to universal military training and support for allowing the wartime conscription law to expire on March 31 this year.

### Regarding General Elections in Poland, the United States Sends Notes to Britain and the Soviet Union Accusing the Polish Government of Taking Oppressive Measures; Polish Peasant Party Plans to Boycott Elections

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The U.S. State Department revealed today that the U.S. government sent notes to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky and British Ambassador Balfour on January 5, accusing the Polish government of engaging in oppressive measures, such as arresting people with different political views through political scrutiny, murder and intrusion into homes, and suppressing freedom of the press. The notes expressed deep concern about these phenomena and stated that if they are not stopped immediately, democratic elections in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement cannot be held. It is reported that the U.S. Ambassador to Warsaw received a memorandum from Polish Peasant Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Mikolajczyk on December 18, revealing the Polish government's suppression of the Peasant Party and its denial of political freedom. Mikolajczyk said that the methods of suppression include arrests, assassinations, forcing Peasant Party members to join groups such as the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, dismissing Peasant Party members from their jobs, and searching their homes. In addition, the publication or circulation of Peasant Party newspapers is prohibited or restricted, and the editor of the party newspaper has been arrested. The note continued that these phenomena have an impact on Polish elections, but are more important in relation to the principles of international agreements. Therefore, the U.S. government, as a signatory to the Potsdam Agreement, believes that it cannot fulfill its duties if it cannot do its best to implement the agreement. Therefore, it believes that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union should urge the Polish government to pay attention to its failure to comply with its obligations under the agreement in the most friendly but most resolute manner.

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 7th] Poland is about to hold general elections. According to Polish Peasant Party Chairman Mikolajczyk, a large number of the party's ballots have been invalidated, and 2 million voters belonging to the party will be unable to vote. The party's executive committee will meet to decide whether to boycott the general election, but this move will depend on how the Director-General of Elections responds.

### Near Parangis Area, Indonesian-Dutch Agreement Ceasefire

East Indian Army Withdraws to Designated Area

[Associated Press, Batavia, 7th] Dutch authorities announced today that the Netherlands and the East Indian Republic government have reached an agreement stipulating that Dutch troops will continue to garrison Parangis alone. A spokesman for the East Indian government said that the agreement is of a provisional nature, and the final resolution will be decided when the head of the Dutch delegation, Mr. Schermerhorn, returns here for a joint meeting. Mr. Schermerhorn came here from Karachi and said before his departure that the future treaty between the Dutch government and the East Indian Republic will be the beginning of close cooperation between the two sides. After the initial agreement is reached, the negotiations required by both parties will be to restore peacetime conditions so that everyone can live and work in peace.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 8th] The East Indian Republican Army retreated from Parangis to an area 12 miles away in accordance with the ceasefire agreement. East Indian troops there had fought fiercely with the Dutch army for several days.

Labor-Management Relations

In the past year – especially the year following the First World War – labor disputes have been incessant.

Although this economic war erupted in 1946, we are now producing a considerable amount of goods and services. However, improving the methods by which labor and management reach agreements and reducing the number of strikes and work stoppages is essential.

We should not adopt punitive bills. We should not pass regulations that inevitably restrict the normal activities of labor in order to punish a few labor leaders. We should not take ill-considered actions driven by emotion that jeopardize our American freedoms and invite unforeseen disasters. When reviewing the record of labor-management disputes in 1946, we should be aware that labor and management failed to reach agreements to end labor unrest. Management is also not without fault. Therefore, we should realize that industrial peace cannot be achieved solely through laws targeting labor unions.

In the past fifteen years, we have established a national labor policy based on the principle of free collective bargaining to determine wages and working conditions.

That national policy remains unchanged. This labor policy should continue to be the national policy.

However, there are still those among us who do not understand what free and fair bargaining is. We also do not fully understand how to fulfill the mutual responsibilities that come with the right to negotiate. Currently, we have some harmful provisions that limit the effectiveness of the collective bargaining system. Moreover, we lack government agencies to help labor and management resolve differences.

Some labor issues should be addressed immediately, while others, due to their complexity, require detailed investigation and research. We should pass legislation to correct some errors and provide for more government assistance in labor-management negotiations. We should also deeply understand the core of labor-management difficulties by putting ourselves in their shoes.

In view of the above, I recommend and urge you to implement the following four-point plan to reduce industrial strife:

First Point

To pass laws as soon as possible to prevent certain improper regulations. First, what is below is the strike caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions for control. The people and the management are innocent bystanders in this kind of strike, but they are greatly damaged by the conflict between the hostile trade unions. This kind of dispute harms production, industry, the people, and the workers themselves. I think it is difficult to prevent strikes caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions for control.

The National Labor Relations Act stipulates a procedure for determining which union represents the employees of a particular employer. However, in some strikes caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions for control, the minority union declares a strike and forces the employer to negotiate with it, ignoring the legal responsibility of negotiating with the majority union. It is inexcusable to force employers to violate the law by striking. It is necessary to pass resolutions to prevent this kind of strike.

Another kind of disharmony between trade unions is the strike caused by disputes between trade unions involving certain issues, that is, the issue of which trade union should be responsible for completing a specific job. When rival trade unions cannot resolve such disputes on their own, the authorities should have some provisions to peacefully resolve the issue.

The next kind of improper regulation is sympathy strikes, which often deepen the conflicts caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions, or force employers to violate the National Labor Relations Act.

Not all sympathy strikes are abnormal. We should judge them by their goals. In other words, sympathy strikes intended to protect wage rates and working conditions are different from those intended to deepen the conflicts caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions. The industrial structure sometimes requires unions to extend certain conflicts beyond the scope of a particular employer. We should not indiscriminately prohibit sympathy strikes. Our goal should be to formulate those that prohibit sympathy strikes with ill intentions, and we should not endanger the right of trade unions to survive and strive for the benefits of genuine collective bargaining. '

The next regulation that urgently needs to be corrected is the use of economic power by labor and management to determine issues arising from the interpretation of existing contracts.

Collective bargaining agreements, like other contracts, should be adhered to by both parties. In the most enlightened labor-management relations, disputes arising from the interpretation of contract content are resolved peacefully through negotiation or arbitration. We should enact legislation to establish an agency that allows labor and management to request arbitration when problems arise in interpreting existing contracts.

Second Point

Is to expand the convenience of assisting collective consultation within the Labor Department.

One of the difficulties we have in avoiding labor disputes is the lack of order in the process of collective consultation. Labor and management often do not understand their responsibility to resolve disputes through automatic negotiation. We often see examples of labor or management using economic power instead of trying to reach an agreement through consultation. Neither labor nor management nor the government has a definite way to determine how government assistance can be elicited. Government agencies should take mediation or arbitration steps to determine the facts of the dispute and report to the public. This agency should facilitate and expedite the resolution of disputes.

Third Point

Is to investigate our social and established plans in order to alleviate the causes of workers' insecurity.

In my message vetoing the Case Bill on June 11, 1946, I outlined my views on labor-management relations. What I said at that time, I will repeat again now: The solution to labor-management difficulties can be found not only in legislation directly related to labor relations, but also in a plan whose purpose is to eliminate the causes of insecurity felt by many workers in our industrial society. For example, Congress should consider extending and expanding our social security system, improving housing problems, a national health plan, and a provision for a fair minimum wage.

Fourth Point

Is to establish a temporary joint committee to study overall labor-management relations.

I recommend that Congress establish such a temporary joint committee to conduct this extensive study.

The President, Congress, and labor and management all have the responsibility to continue to cooperate in order to find a solution to labor problems. Now I suggest that this committee be organized as follows: Congress should elect twelve members from the members of the two houses of the two parties, and the President should appoint eight representatives of the people and representatives of labor. The committee shall be responsible for conducting investigations and recommendations on major issues. The main problems include:

First, national strikes in various important industries that affect the public interest. In addition, the committee should study how to deal with and prevent strikes at the same time without harming democratic freedom.

The future of the entire industry in the United States depends on the proper resolution of these strike issues. The far-reaching impact of national strikes in transportation, coal mining, oil, steel, and telecommunications is to create national turmoil. We have recently used special wartime legislation to avoid these turmoils, but these special wartime powers will soon be abolished. These powers must be replaced by another appropriate and effective system and institution. This issue requires our careful study and courageous response. However, this method of response must be in line with the protection of our people's rights. This need is urgent, and the committee must pay attention to this matter as soon as possible.

Second, is the best method and steps to achieve collective bargaining. This point should include that labor and management can negotiate freely and fairly, and avoid strikes and deadlocks as much as possible before the negotiation and coordination completely fail.

Third, is the internal factors of labor and management disputes. Some of these factors require long-term research. However, the committee can immediately consider some other issues and immediately submit recommendations to Congress.

I recommend that the committee complete a report including legislative recommendations by March 15, 1947.

(To be continued tomorrow)

### Zhang Wei Severely Criticized, Expresses Deep Frustration, Submits Two Points of Review Opinion to the General Assembly for Public Discussion, Aftermath of the Garbage Truck Case, Emergency Panel Meeting Held to Discuss

[Reported by this Newspaper] Regarding the temporary motion at the previous general meeting of the Municipal Council's Health Committee regarding the private corruption and malfeasance of the Health Bureau's garbage trucks, an urgent review was needed. Therefore, an emergency panel meeting was held at 5 pm yesterday in the reception room of Zhengshi Middle School, chaired by Fan Shouyuan, with Director Zhang Wei attending to report on the handling of the matter again. He said: After I learned about the private affairs of the drivers, I sent staff to disguise themselves and secretly investigate at midnight. Previously, it was discovered that six garbage trucks were running private affairs, and later another seven were discovered. According to the report: "The drivers agreed with the vegetable vendors that each time they privately brought vegetables to the vegetable vendors, the price was 400 to 700 yuan." I immediately requested the mayor to dismiss them and expel the leaders. However, the drivers' lives are difficult and worthy of sympathy. Although the matter has been repeatedly submitted to the Cleanliness Committee, Municipal Council meetings for discussion, and reported to the mayor personally, there has been no proper solution. I also discussed solutions with Liu Hongsheng, who advocated selling the garbage trucks to the drivers for safekeeping, with the municipal government drawing 60% as repayment of the truck price, but it was also not realized due to various difficulties. Director Zhang also stated that he was not protecting his subordinates, but although there are a few bad elements in the bureau who endanger the regulations, at the same time, there are indeed many personnel who are dedicated to their duties and work hard. He felt deeply frustrated by the heavy criticism from the councilors and said: "I have resigned to the mayor four times, but all four times were not approved, but at my age, I dare not leave without saying goodbye. I am extremely willing to accept your strict handling, and at the very least, give me a dismissal." After speaking, Director Zhang complied with the councilors' request and withdrew.

### Councilors Express Opinions, Attitudes Vary

The attending councilors expressed their opinions on the case, and their attitudes varied. Some believed that the driver's responsibility was small and the director's responsibility was great. Although the driver's difficult life could be sympathized with, the issue of discipline could not be ignored and must be dealt with strictly. The mayor also knew that the law was being violated but did not stop it, and should also be held responsible. Councilor Zhao Junhao expressed that although Director Zhang's handling of the case was inappropriate, the drivers were unwilling to work because their salaries were too low, making it extremely difficult for the director to handle matters. In terms of reason and sentiment, it was forgivable, so he suggested that the General Assembly dismiss the illegal garbage truck drivers and then find another way to deal with it. Councilor Lu Shidao, who attended the meeting, provided two points of opinion: (1) The salaries of public officials are meager, and private affairs are inevitable. Sympathy is possible, but the municipal councilors have the responsibility to supervise the municipal government. The dignified director admits to this incident in the General Assembly and allows it to act as such. If this continues, the municipal councilors will not need to discuss it in the future. Speaking from an objective position, the director's difficulties in handling affairs should be forgiven, but the director should consider how much power he has beforehand. This is his incompetence. (2) The Municipal Council has already raised this matter and everyone is paying attention to it. If it ends without a result, where is our justice? Therefore, this matter must be handled solemnly.

However, Councilor Mei Bingfan believed that in terms of reason and sentiment, the director should be treated leniently and not made too embarrassed. If you want to deal with it strictly, you should find out whether the director has committed fraud, and you cannot do it arbitrarily.

### Two Points of Opinion

After discussion and approval, the result was based on the draft review report submitted by Councilor Chen Cunren, which was then revised by the entire committee, and two points were formulated: (1) The Director of the Health Bureau should be held responsible for acknowledging that the illegal behavior of his subordinates is legal, and should guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. (2) In order to rectify the discipline of public officials, a letter should be sent to the municipal government to severely punish the staff involved in the case, and report the handling situation to this council. The Health Committee has no right to resolve the above review report, and it must be submitted to the General Assembly for review.

### Zhang Wei's Oral Reply on General Health Issues

Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei verbally replied to the questions raised the other day, stating: The municipal hospital is self-sufficient because of insufficient funding in the past. Although it is said to be self-sufficient now, the municipal government still provides subsidies. Previously, there were 531 beds distributed in various hospitals. Now, it has been changed to a preferential method, which can subsidize more patients. As for the municipal hospital's distribution being average and the quantity being large, it cannot be said to be a merger now, but an adjustment of distribution, an increase in capacity, no increase in staff, and expenses can be saved. The issue of feces and urine also requires special handling. Now that it has been taken back for self-management, although there are cadres, there is still a feeling of difficulty in management. It is not yet certain whether to invite merchants to contract for it. People are being asked to study it. Regarding restricting the fees charged by private hospitals, I frankly say: No doctor has made a fortune. If there is a fortune, it is due to a side business; as for the treatment of patients in private hospitals, if there is any, it will be dealt with severely. The issue of the Guohua Funeral Home was reviewed during the tenure of former Director Yu and was not enemy property, so it was returned. The school's collection of health fees is taken from students and used for students, and has nothing to do with regular health expenses. Regarding whether the Health Bureau's staff has been reduced, it has followed the resolution of the Municipal Council to reduce the administrative staff. The problem of rabies-bitten dogs relapsing after vaccination may be related to the bite site. The same is true all over the world, and about 3% cannot be saved. Due to time constraints, those who have not answered other questions will be answered in writing.

### The Third Meeting of the Municipal Council Will Be Held Today, Panel Review Meeting

[Reported by this Newspaper] The second general meeting of the Municipal Council held its third meeting yesterday afternoon. First, the directors of the Police, Social Affairs, Health, and Education Bureaus answered questions from the second meeting. Then, the councilors raised questions to the directors of the Finance, Land Administration, Public Utilities, and Public Works Bureaus. The Health Committee held a temporary meeting to discuss the garbage truck private affairs case and decided on two review reports to be submitted to the General Assembly for public discussion.

Today's agenda will be the first and second panel review meetings, which will be held at the Municipal Council in Fuming Village and the China Merchants Bureau, respectively. Also, in order to discuss the budget in detail, the trial meeting is scheduled to hold two budget committee meetings on the morning of the 10th and 12th, and a general meeting on the morning of the 11th, specifically to discuss the budget for this year.

### Request to Increase Tuition Fees at All Levels, Establish a Women's Normal School, Director of Education Bureau Answers Questions

[Reported by this Newspaper] Director of the Education Bureau Gu Yuxiu answered questions at yesterday's General Assembly: (1) The education expenses up to November totaled 1.8 billion yuan, and some expenses were not included. The newly added national education classes in October, November, and December cost 1.3 billion yuan, including living subsidies for teachers and staff. The municipal schools have prepaid more than 2 billion yuan, and the municipal government has approved 3.7 billion yuan, but it has not yet been received. It is planned to repay 60% of the municipal schools' hot money by the end of this year, but the Finance Bureau has not yet raised funds. (2) The radio education station has been included in this year's work plan and should be implemented. (3) In order to tighten the organization, the art normal school has been merged into the normal school, but the art normal school is indeed necessary. Please consider re-establishing it so that it can be established. (4) The fee standard for private schools in the second semester of last year was 80,000 to 120,000 yuan for elementary schools, 120,000 to 160,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 160,000 to 200,000 yuan for high schools. According to the cost of living index last month, it has increased by 45% compared to the previously set tuition fees. Now, in order to take care of both, it is planned to increase it by 25%. Please re-set elementary schools to 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, junior high schools to 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, and high schools to 200,000 to 250,000 yuan. (5) Municipal elementary and secondary school teachers have requested subsidies for academic advancement fees. Please submit it to the municipal government and ask the General Assembly to allocate it in the budget. The above three points have been listed by the mayor as a referral case and sent to the General Assembly for public decision yesterday. (6) The municipal sports field has repeatedly negotiated with the military authorities to recover it, but no result has been obtained. It has now been requested that the municipal government submit a claim for compensation to the Ministry of National Defense. (7) The procedures for registering private schools will be handled leniently and quickly. (8) There are currently 112 schools in suburban areas, and more than 1,500 national education classes have been established, accounting for more than half of the total. If there are houses, it is still planned to add more. The funds for the dedicated school can be used for national schools first. (9) Private schools should set up 25% for free regulations for children of public teachers, but the investigation results show that Gu Jun only has 15%. Now, it has been notified again. (10) The Women's Normal School is planned to be converted from the former Kindergarten Normal School. It is currently consulting with the Executive Yuan. It will be established after the overseas Chinese orphanage is closed. (11) If there are any personnel affiliated with the Education Bureau, please report it, and it will be dealt with seriously. Also, if the Municipal Council believes that there are too many school teachers, they can also be reduced.

### Department of Social Affairs Answers Questions

[Reported by this Newspaper] Director of the Department of Social Affairs Wu Kaixian answered the councilors' questions regarding the department at yesterday's General Assembly, saying: (1) The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee is organized according to the separate laws and regulations stipulated by the Executive Yuan and adopts a collegial approach. The Department of Social Affairs is responsible for mediation, and its evaluation scope is limited to those with city-wide characteristics. (2) There are three public pawnshops that have already been established, and it is planned to establish several more. After the expiration, bidding will be held. The regulations stipulate that if the bidding amount exceeds the original fixed amount, the excess amount can be taken back with the pawn ticket. The first phase is about to be held. If the results are good, it will continue to be held. Public pawnshops will also be established in appropriate locations in the civilian area. (3) It has been decided to formally establish the Women's Shelter after the winter relief shelter for the cold is closed and dispersed.

### There is no Market for Domestic Cotton Because the Fibers are too Short

(4) There is no market for domestic cotton. It is not that yarn factories are unwilling to use it, but that the cotton fibers are too short. Efforts are now being made to improve cotton seeds. (5) The property of the Jing'an Temple involves judicial issues. Because the host of the temple is suspected of being a traitor, his autonomy cannot be deprived before the court's verdict. (6) Commercial registration is in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. If two companies with the same brand name register at the same time, they must be reviewed first. Otherwise, the first registrant has priority. (7) Regarding winter relief, the purpose is to obtain donations, and the method cannot be taken into account. In the previous election of Miss Shanghai, more than 2.1 billion yuan was raised to relieve the victims of Northern Jiangsu, with a net surplus of more than 300 million yuan, which is a large difference, but it can also relieve many refugees. This winter relief plans to raise 400 million yuan, and the charity ball can also collect 100 million yuan. (8) In order to enable child and refugee refugees to find their own jobs, we have now contacted the China Travel Service to set up training classes for them to serve as waiters at travel agencies around the country. We have also contacted China Aviation Corporation to set up wireless training classes. If successful, they can be held this year. In addition, refugees and refugee children are trained to repair cars. (9) Unemployed workers in the rear have already contacted various factories and arranged for two people to be placed among every ten people. More than 1,000 of the more than 2,000 workers now have jobs.

### Police Chief Answers Questions

Acting Police Chief Yu Shuping gave an oral answer yesterday to the questions raised by the councilors to the police department the other day, saying: (1) Regarding the fire equipment fee issue, the previous General Assembly decided on 500 million yuan. It was submitted to the municipal government in December last year, but it has not been allocated so far. During the tenure of former Mayor Qian, 500 million yuan was allocated, and a contract was signed with Zhendan Company to order equipment. (2) Regarding the police treatment issue, after repeated adjustments, third-class police officers can now receive 146,004 yuan per month, and first-class police officers can receive 195,000 yuan. With the mayor's concern, each person is issued an additional five buckets of rice. In terms of welfare, each bureau has a public canteen, uniforms, and dormitories. In terms of education, there are children's schools. When sick, there is a police hospital, and bereavement expenses are given special treatment. In addition, due to the high cost of living, the mayor approved another 50,000 yuan for each person. (3) This bureau is only rectifying the city's appearance and not trying to beautify it. The volunteer police officers who are recruited must have graduated from junior high school and have a clean background to meet the standards. (4) The problem of bandits in Beixinjing is only due to the harassment of local hooligans, scattered soldiers, and ruffians. On Friday night last week, I personally supervised the suppression and arrested seven people and obtained two guns. No more robberies have been reported since then. (5) Regarding the adjustment of opium smokers, the address of the sleep cement is in the police hospital, the equipment is perfect, the facts are all there, please visit. (6) Regarding the abolition of the mounted patrol, the mounted patrol has its own existing effect. It is responsible for patrolling the suburbs and suppressing riots. It has a great effect. It also dispatched troops to Beixinjing to suppress bandits this time. Otherwise, it would not be so fast. All 250 horses were allocated by the Army Headquarters. (7) The penalties for violations are announced by each branch at the beginning of the month, 60% of which is handed over to the national treasury and 40% of which is used as bonuses. (8) The budget for the household registration survey work is 14 billion yuan, which is a support for the five-year plan, pending the public decision of the General Assembly. (9) The police museum is a police education tool, which is different from the museum of the Education Bureau. (10) The police hospital is set up for police welfare. It is necessary for business and criminal investigation and for the needs of prisoners and patients with diseases. It is necessary to retain it. (11) Regarding the hawker incident, this bureau is responsible for the implementation of the ban due to the repeated orders from the municipal government, the questions from the council, and the public opinion. After repeated persuasion and repeated extensions, no effect was achieved. The incident on November 28 has been investigated by Mayor Pan, Speaker, and Councilor Tang. (12) Regarding confiscated items, according to the Violation Penalty Law, the confiscated goods are jointly sold by the Municipal Government Lun Order with the Finance Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau Audit Office, and the proceeds are used for relief. (13) Regarding Councilor Zhang Zhihan's claim that he witnessed the police arbitrarily taking items from vendors, he hopes that in the future, when it occurs, he can report the police number and car number to the police station, which will definitely be dealt with according to law. Due to time constraints, other questions will be answered in writing later.

### Hotel Tax: Believed to be Without Legal Basis; The City Government Must Not Be Doing "Pickled Cucumber" Work

After a ten-minute break, the questioning of the four bureaus of finance, land administration, public works, and public utilities, as well as the civil affairs office, began.

Regarding the finance department, Shao Yongsheng stated: The hotel tax has no legal basis. The previous general assembly did not approve it, and its tax rate is 20% of the room price, which exceeds the statutory tax rate even if it is considered a special tax. If it is said that the taxable objects are foreign transit passengers, because they are not responsible for municipal construction donations; then, if residents of this city leave Shanghai for Hangzhou, can they recover the municipal construction donations paid for a few days from the finance bureau, and will the Hangzhou municipal government also levy hotel taxes on Shanghai passengers? A dignified government cannot do this "pickled cucumber" work, as it is not in accordance with the law and lacks reason. Dong Ganwen stated: The finance bureau needs to re-examine the tax revenue itself. Qu Yue stated: Although the business license is handled by the finance bureau, there are procedures for investigating the health police and other bureaus. The official documents are exchanged and waited for approval, but it is unknown when they will be issued. It is hoped that the various bureaus of the municipal government will act quickly in the future.

### Actual Number of City Government Employees Differs from Budget

Li Wenjie questioned two points: (1) When reviewing the recompiled budget for the second half of this year, according to the investigation report, the actual number of city government employees was 41,775 in July and August, 41,772 in September, 41,155 in October, and 43,959 in November and December. However, the budget submitted by the city government lists a total of 53,154 people, a difference of 10,000. What is the reason for this? (2) The budget expenditure for the security police in the second half of last year was 3.2 billion. However, by November of last year, the expenditure for regular and temporary expenses had reached more than 4.6 billion, not including December. What is the reason? Tang Shichang stated: I received a payment notice for the municipal construction donation on December 24 last year, which stated that it should be paid by December 19. After negotiations, it was extended to the end of December, but due to being busy, it was only paid on January 4, and a penalty of 10% was imposed. In the future, please the authorities carefully consider and extend the deadline for payment.

### Financial Accounts: Request for Disclosure

Yang Fuzuo stated: The city government likes to open new taxes and does not like to sort out old taxes. Everyone knows that the items of municipal taxes and the high tax rates are complicated. Therefore, he requested three points: (1) The financial accounting authorities should be responsible for the accuracy of the budget figures. (2) They must also be responsible for the implementation of tax collection. (3) Financial accounts should be absolutely open, as open as possible, and quickly open.

### Labor Substitute Fee: Seems Unnecessary

Zhu Yapu asked: (1) Does the city treasury have a surplus at the end of the year? If there is a surplus, how much is it? (2) In the budget for the 36th year, there is an item for labor substitute fee, which the general public is very dissatisfied with, considering it equivalent to a poll tax, which seems unnecessary. Zhong Yuliang stated: There are many inconsistencies in the grain strings in Baoshan and other suburban areas. The finance bureau should be requested to conduct joint investigation and registration with the land administration bureau, so as to have hope of clearing them up. Yu Chuanding requested the finance bureau to investigate and eliminate the corrupt practices of the collection office personnel. Sun Zhenchun stated that when school principals of the city schools collect funds from the city treasury, the staff of that office have an arrogant attitude and often show contempt and create difficulties, and give them the cold shoulder. The finance bureau should order them to correct their attitude in the future.

### Suspected of Embezzling and Selling Materials: Wang Gongxia Will Be Sent to Nanjing for Interrogation; Zhou Yunlong and Song An Were Also Detained

Wang Gongxia, a former major general and deputy adjutant of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, is suspected of embezzling and selling materials during his tenure. Someone reported him to the highest authorities in Nanjing. It is reported that the Garrison Headquarters recently received a telegram from the Ministry of National Defense, ordering the headquarters to quickly detain Wang Gongxia and his accomplices Zhou Yunlong (former lieutenant colonel adjutant of the Garrison Headquarters) and Song An (former colonel section chief of the Japanese Overseas Management Office), and send the three criminals, together with the original case, to the Military Law Office of the Ministry of National Defense for interrogation. After receiving the order, the Garrison Headquarters arrested Zhou Yunlong at the Jiangwan Training Corps on the evening before last, arrested Song An at 467 Dixiwei Road, and summoned Wang Gongxia to the case at 7 Meiliyuan, Daxilu. They are currently sorting out the case files and will soon transfer them to the Military Law Office of the Ministry of National Defense for interrogation.

Involved in the Rong Desheng Kidnapping Case

[Another report] The occurrence of this case was actually caused by a case of embezzlement and sale of public property, which occurred a year ago. It is said that at that time, a warehouse that had been taken over was reported stolen. The thieves were arrested afterward and interrogated by the Military Law Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. So far, the criminals are still in custody. According to the situation at the time, the case involved a wide range of people, because the car used by the embezzlers belonged to Wang Gongxia, the former deputy adjutant of the Garrison Headquarters (editor's note: Wang was the deputy adjutant at the time, and the car used for the Rong Desheng kidnapping case last year was also borrowed by Wang). The key to the warehouse was kept by Song An, the colonel section chief of the General Affairs Section of the Japanese Overseas Management Office, so Zhu was also arrested after the case occurred. At the same time, Zhou Yunlong, the lieutenant colonel adjutant of the Garrison Headquarters, was also suspected of being involved. Later, Song was released on bail, and a year passed. Recently, it was learned that the Garrison Headquarters received a secret order from the Ministry of National Defense to send the relevant personnel in the case to Nanjing for interrogation.

### Mayor Says There is Hope for Recovering the Racecourse

[This newspaper report] According to Mayor Wu's remarks outside the meeting yesterday: There is considerable hope for the issue of recovering the racecourse. It is said that the Jockey Club may allow land to be exchanged for land, but it must be allowed to race horses on the land developed elsewhere. This case must be approved by the Senate before negotiations can proceed.

### One More Meeting, One More Tax Increase

Zhu Yapu also stated: The public believes that every time the Senate holds a meeting, the people's taxes increase. Therefore, some are saying that it is better not to hold the meetings. Therefore, it is hoped that colleagues will carefully consider the municipal government's budget for the 36th year, taking into account whether the public can afford it.

### Interrogation of the Land Administration Department

Regarding the land administration department, Shi Jiadong stated: Please publicize all the public land in the city by the land administration bureau and lease it to the public at a low price, so as to solve some of the housing shortage problems. Qu Yue and Gu Jinzao stated: Near the Meifu Oil Station in Zhujiaqiao, Pudong, the Japanese had enclosed 300 mu of land during the occupation period and used it as an anti-aircraft artillery position. After the victory, the residents had requested that it be returned. Now there is no news, and it is a pity to let it lie barren. Please investigate and clarify it quickly so that it can be cultivated and produced. Guo Jinzao also stated: He registered at Shenzhou on January 17, 35 and requested a land license, but there has been no result so far. In April of last year, he also applied for registration, but there has been no news. After inquiring, he was told that the registration paper had been lost. This should be investigated and clarified. Yu Chuanding stated: What is the result of the land administration bureau's investigation and handling of the more than 640 mu of public land illegally sold by the municipal government during the enemy-occupied period? There is no report. In addition, the number of mu often written on the land title issued by the bureau after land registration is less than the actual amount, and there is no case of writing more. Huang Bingquan stated: The land value tax has been levied, but the valuation is incorrect, and the taxpayer's ability to pay taxes is not taken into account. In the same area, the tax amount differs by three-quarters. What standard is used for valuation?

### Regarding the Issue of Limiting Electricity Use: Councilors Spoke Enthusiastically; Some Areas are Restricted, While Others are Not; Please Ask the Public Utilities Bureau Where the Control Capacity Lies

The questioning of the public utilities department was particularly heated on issues such as restricting electricity use. Zhang Zhongyuan stated: Taxes must be added to the public, but electricity use must be restricted. The public does not even have the freedom to use very little electricity, let alone other things. Wang Jian'e stated: There is an overall doubt about the Public Utilities Bureau. If the restriction on electricity use is ordered by the Public Utilities Bureau, it has been implemented in the former French Concession area, but there is no restriction in the former International Settlement area. It is said that this is because the American Electric Power Company does not agree. At present, public utilities have Chinese, American, British, and French merchants, all of which are not within the scope of state-owned enterprises. If there is no control capacity, there is simply no need to set up a Public Utilities Bureau. What is the actual central work of the Public Utilities Bureau now? How effective is the restriction on electricity use? Ma Junshuo stated: It is now said that the French merchants have a generator arriving in Shanghai, and the restriction on electricity use seems to be able to be canceled. Director Zhao once said that the restriction measures could be revoked from February 1. Please give a definite answer.

Also, Wang Wei stated: Street lights are very important for traffic. The last general meeting decided to ask the Public Utilities Bureau to install them as soon as possible, but so far only half of the budget has been spent. Is it due to a shortage of materials? Or is it related to the issue of regional jurisdiction? Xu Zexiang stated: Residents of Nanshi and residents of the central area have the same obligations, but the rights they enjoy are different. This may be due to historical reasons. The enjoyment of tap water and electric lights has always been the same as in the central area, but recently, Nanshi often has power outages, and there are several times a day. Residents feel very inconvenient. Please ask whether this move by the Public Utilities Bureau is planned, or whether it can be notified in advance so that residents can be prepared.

### Ferry Fares: No Change Given

Gu Jinzao stated: There are 120,000 people traveling to and from the Dongchang Road wharf every day. The Public Utilities Bureau stipulates that the ferry fare is 160 yuan. It is not easy for the public to prepare small change, and the Public Utilities Bureau does not give back 40 yuan. In this way, the extra income is more than 1 million yuan per day. Most of those traveling to and from the wharf are coolie workers. It is hoped that the bureau can improve the appropriate methods. In addition, the attitude of the ferry personnel on both sides of Dongchang Road is no different from the enemy-occupied period, and they should also be stopped. Yu Shun stated: Street traffic is still very congested. Are there any thorough improvement methods for traffic? The old Garbage Bridge is a shortcut to the North Railway Station and the court. Can tricycles and rickshaws be allowed to resume traffic? On some tram lines, passengers are crowded. Can the number of trams running be increased? Also, when calling the East District, you must first dial 02, which is not easy to get through. Can it be improved? Zhang Zhongyuan stated: When asking the telephone company to add an extension, the answer is "no." However, many electrical companies have such extensions. For commercial convenience, can the Public Utilities Bureau notify the telephone company to allow citizens who can buy extensions to install them easily?

### For Three Months, There is No Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Sense of Shame

Also, the four large neon light characters for propriety, justice, integrity, and sense of shame on the roof of the International Hotel have been dark for three months recently. Shanghai cannot be without propriety, justice, integrity, and sense of shame. Can they be relit? Yan Guolian stated: Regarding the issue of banning rickshaws, the last general meeting decided to implement it in three years. This time, some National Assembly representatives also requested a temporary delay in the ban.

### Ignoring Both Sides While Repairing Roads; Neglecting Tributaries While Dredging Rivers

Regarding the interrogation of the Public Works Bureau, Yan Guodong stated: The Public Works Bureau is currently conducting a joint investigation with the police department to demolish unlicensed shanties in restricted construction areas. However, the last general meeting decided that the ban should be temporarily postponed until the construction of civilian housing is completed. Shi Jiadong stated that there are many bamboo-and-straw houses in Zhabei, Nanshi. It is hoped that attention will be paid to them before construction. Zhou Lianze asked: According to the current survey, there are an estimated 60,000 shanties in Shanghai. It is said that only more than 700 have licenses. What is the Public Works Bureau doing? Hou Junren and Qu Yue questioned the dredging of rivers, stating that the Public Works Bureau only focuses on major rivers and ignores tributaries. More attention should be paid to them in the future to facilitate farmland irrigation. Since it has been listed as a central task this year, it should be carried out actively. Shi Jiadong stated that the construction of new roads only focuses on the middle of the road and ignores both sides. As a result, rickshaws also go to the flat road in the middle, and vehicle accidents occur frequently. It is hoped that attention will be paid to this point when constructing roads in the future. He also stated that since the city appearance is being rectified, why are there still enemy and puppet obstacles in the Xiaodongmen area? Sun Zhenchun stated that in the Jiahua Ferry, Fanhuangdu area in western Shanghai, the roads are muddy and waterlogged whenever it rains, which is difficult to travel. It is hoped that it can be improved. Yu Chuanding stated that the bureau should not listen to the one-sided reports of the road inspectors, and should conduct a detailed review, otherwise there will be many things that disturb the people. But Shanghai has now taken one-tenth of the country, and it should be temporarily implemented now.

### Entertainment Tax: Decision to Follow Central Government Regulations

[This newspaper report] The City Senate is very concerned about the issue of reducing entertainment tax in the city. According to reliable sources yesterday: The City Senate has decided to follow the central government regulations and request the city government to reduce the entertainment tax to 25%. Although the city government's budget still exceeds 25%, the City Senate will not pass it.

### Temporary Approval Measures for Street Vendors Outside the Eleventh District Market Have Been Agreed Upon

Regarding the petition to the Senate by the stallholders outside the Eleventh District's vegetable market, City Senator Tang Shichang et al., Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei, and Police Bureau Director Fang Zhiyue jointly discussed the matter yesterday. As a result, it was agreed that stalls would be temporarily allowed to be set up under the principle of not violating traffic regulations. It was also decided that stalls would not be allowed to be set up outside the front gate of the Shanhai Road vegetable market, up to Shanhai Lane, and at the back up to Sande Lane. In other places, stalls are temporarily allowed to be set up along the roadside, but they are not allowed to be placed in the middle of the road. The time limit is tentatively set at two months. However, the police bureau stated that if order is maintained and traffic is not obstructed, the time limit can be extended and stalls can continue to be allowed to be set up.

### Chinese Employees of Electric Company Petition for Improved Treatment

[This newspaper report] Yesterday, 160 Chinese employees of the Electric Company sent representatives, including Shen Tong, to petition the City Senate. They believe that the city government's mandatory reduction of the Shanghai Electric Company's employee benefits is detrimental to the harmonious relationship between labor and management. They also petitioned for a review of the company's employees' high efficiency plan. Was this plan reviewed and approved by the City Senate? Because the situation is urgent, they hope to uphold justice and correct it according to law. The speaker first assigned two senators, Huang Bingquan and Ye Xianggao, to represent the petitioners and reported: (1) The petitioners are all senior employees of the company; (2) They believe that the salary discount set by the "City Government's Cost of Living Index Application Committee" is inappropriate; (3) They expressed opposition to the Social Affairs Bureau's instruction that "employees of various public utility companies shall not retire at the time of demobilization unless they are over 60 years old or unable to work due to illness."

Later, because the petitioners requested that members of the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee meet with them, the speaker reassigned Ma Junshuo and Zhu Fuji to meet with them. The representatives further stated: (1) Does the resolution of the Cost of Living Index Application Committee have any legal basis for implementing the long-standing agreement between labor and management? (2) They requested that the city government's announced cost of living index be fully rewarded and issued according to the original company regulations based on the base salary. (3) The Social Affairs Bureau's method of gradually reducing the amount of employee retirement benefits is vastly different from the company's original method and affects work efficiency. Please handle it according to the company's original method. The senators immediately agreed to report the petition to the general assembly and submit it to the Legal Affairs and Social Affairs Committees for review and reply.

### Murder Case Occurs in Paris New Village

[This newspaper report] A murder case occurred in Paris New Village, Chongqing South Road yesterday morning. The victim was Jiang Fuchen, a Sipu, 38 years old, from Beiping, who had worked in the village for 12 years, and lived at No. 61, A. The night before, Jiang followed the usual practice of working the night shift. However, at about 3 a.m. yesterday morning, a resident of the village returned from outside. Because calling for the iron gate to be opened was unsuccessful, his wife, Ms. Jia (35 years old, from Zhejiang), became suspicious and hurriedly got up and searched the village. When she arrived at No. 96 (near Siwei Village) at the end of the village, she saw Jiang lying face down on the ground, vomiting blood. She felt him and found that he had died. She was extremely shocked and screamed. Nearby residents heard the sound and came out to look. In the dim light, they saw two fingernail marks on Jiang's neck, indicating that he had been strangled to death. At the same time, around 1 o'clock, someone had heard Jiang shout "You run!", followed by the sound of footsteps. Finally, they faintly heard "Help!" However, it was late at night, and it was drizzling, and after the "Help!" sound, there was no more sound, so they did not suspect anything else. Ms. Jia immediately reported the case to the Taishan Police Sub-bureau, which sent officers to investigate. Not far from the body, they found a wool hat and a net bag left behind by the murderer, which were immediately taken back to the police station. The body of the deceased was sent to the Tongren Fuyuantang autopsy room for examination. This reporter went to the scene of the incident yesterday to investigate. According to his colleague Li Shuchen, Jiang was usually kind and amiable to others, and was loyal to his duties, so he was ambushed this morning, probably because the gangster refused to be arrested.

### Youth Radio Station etc. Please Exempt from Closure

"Youth", "New Movement", "Youth Culture", and "Seafarer" radio stations were also closed down yesterday. The persons in charge of each radio station convened an emergency joint meeting yesterday and jointly telegraphed the Garrison Headquarters, requesting a postponement of the ban, and telegraphed the Central Broadcasting Administration, requesting permission to establish the stations.

### Cracking Down on the Manufacturing of Counterfeit American Cigarettes

[This newspaper report] The Penglai Sub-bureau learned that there was a counterfeit American cigarette Marlboro Red Samsung machine at No. 6, Cishan Lane, Yingshi Road, and ordered police officers to arrest them. As a result, Fu Youfu, Wang Shouliang, and others were arrested, and the evidence was taken to the bureau.

### All Flight Personnel of China National Aviation Corporation Recommend the Central Government Improve Equipment and Propose Points Considered Minimum Conditions for Ensuring Safety; Director of Civil Aviation Administration Arrives in Shanghai to Supervise

[This newspaper report] The flight personnel of the China National Aviation Corporation currently in this office, including Chinese pilots, co-pilots, navigators, and wireless telegraph operators, about 70 in number, and about 35 American pilots, wrote to Chairman Chiang, President Song, Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei, and Director of Civil Aviation Administration Dai Anguo yesterday. The letter stated: The safety equipment for Chinese commercial flights is far from perfect. The modern aviation safety equipment used by various American airlines is mostly lacking. The letter also put forward several specific recommendations, which the flight personnel considered to be the minimum conditions for ensuring the safety of commercial flights.

They believe that these recommendations are purely for the purpose of ensuring the safety of future air passengers and assisting the sound development of Chinese aviation. The various recommendations are based on their daily flight experience over the past few years.

The main points of the recommendations are as follows: All obstacles at airports and landing sites must be removed. Airports and runways must be kept in good condition. Runway lights must maintain sufficient intensity. (Chinese commercial airports lack sufficient night flight equipment). All unnecessary buildings, towers, and ditches must be removed. Various flight wireless equipment should be managed and supervised by the government. All airports should have modern weather observation equipment. Weather reports should be continued 24 hours a day. Weather forecasts and wind direction at the destination should be reported to all intermediate stations. Various airlines and the Civil Aviation Administration and the Chinese Air Force authorities should consult on a nationally unified air traffic control. All stations should have qualified wireless personnel and equipment. All terminals should have qualified repair personnel and store sufficient equipment. The letter concluded that the above-mentioned equipment is either completely lacking or incomplete at Chinese commercial airports.

In addition, in order to thoroughly investigate the repeated accidents of airlines and to inspect all the aircraft and airport equipment of the China and Central Aviation Corporations, the Ministry of Transportation has specially dispatched Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to Shanghai to supervise and inspect everything on the spot. It is learned that Director Dai and Chen Zhuolin, general manager of the Central Aviation Corporation, and several others took the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday and arrived yesterday. After getting off the train, Dai drove to the Central Aviation Corporation for a short rest, and in the afternoon drove to Longhua Airport. First, he summoned the heads of the flight crew and radio groups of the China National Aviation Corporation and asked about the takeoff standard, communication situation, and landing guidance technology. The heads of the groups gave appropriate answers. He returned to the urban area at about 5 o'clock and is scheduled to continue inspecting various equipment in the next few days, and will summon the heads of various groups of the two companies at any time.

According to reliable sources, the heads of the two companies were summoned by Minister Yu after arriving in Nanjing the day before yesterday. Minister Yu was very angry about the re-accident of the China National Aviation Corporation in Qingdao, so he questioned General Manager Shen of the China National Aviation Corporation quite a bit and ordered him to prepare an accident report for aircraft No. 121 immediately. The heads of the two companies prepared detailed information on all the equipment of the two companies for submission to Minister Yu for review.

[Another report] General Manager Shen of the China National Aviation Corporation, Huazi, director of the flight crew, and others returned to Shanghai on a special plane to Nanjing yesterday. It is reported that when they flew over Nanjing the day before yesterday, they encountered snow, and the special plane circled in the air for 20 minutes before landing, which was quite dangerous. Yesterday, both mail and freight transportation in the valley resumed.

### Three Passenger Plane Disasters: Amnesty Does Not Intend to Pursue Further; Civil Aviation Plane Disasters in Qingdao; District Prosecutor's Office Investigating

[This newspaper report] The prosecutors of the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, Wu Qihua, Cao Hong, and Ji Su, personally inspected the three aircraft disasters in Shanghai on Christmas last year at Jiangwan Longhua Airfield. They visited the China and Central Aviation Corporations to collect materials from various sources, and sent a letter to the Hankou District Court Prosecutor's Office requesting assistance in the investigation. They are currently waiting for a reply. However, the amnesty decree was promulgated on New Year's Day. Even if the two companies had operational negligence that caused death in the three aircraft disasters, the heaviest sentence would be no more than five years' imprisonment, which is usually included in the amnesty. Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office does not intend to pursue its criminal responsibility further. However, their dereliction of duty is undeniable. After the prosecutor's investigation has a result, the entire case may be transferred to the Supervisory Commission for administrative punishment. Recently, China National Aviation Corporation's Flight No. 121 from Shanghai to Pinghu crashed again in Qingdao. After seeing the report, Huang Liang, the Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, believed that civil aviation aircraft had crashed repeatedly, providing no protection for passengers' lives. The company's negligence of duty should bear legal responsibility. Moreover, this accident occurred on January 5 this year, which is outside the time limit stipulated by the amnesty and cannot enjoy the benefits of the amnesty again. He specifically instructed prosecutors Ji Su and Shen Zushou yesterday afternoon to jointly be responsible for the investigation.

### Neglecting Preventive Plans; Human Efforts Greatly Deficient

Supervisory Commission Pays Attention to Aircraft Accidents

The Central and China Aviation Corporations destroyed three aircraft at Longhua Jiangwan Airfield on the 25th of last month, and dozens of passengers were killed and injured. The Jiangsu District Supervisory Commission paid great attention and immediately sent personnel to investigate separately after the accident. In addition to reviewing weather reports and the back-and-forth telegrams between various aviation stations and aircraft, they also asked in detail about the airport equipment and rescue process. This reporter inquired with the Supervisory Commission yesterday about the progress of the investigation. They were told that the main reasons for this aircraft accident were the bad weather and the incomplete airport equipment. The company's negligence in preventive plans and human efforts were greatly deficient.

### Little Traitor of Wu County, Gong Jianxun, Under Interrogation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Gong Jianxun, who formerly served as the head of the Water Patrol Team of the puppet Wu County Police Bureau, was brought to trial at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Gong is a native of Wu County and originally made a living as a seal engraver. During the War of Resistance, he became closely acquainted with Cao Zhang Jue Shengzhi Shi of the enemy's military police and Special Agent Cao Zhang Jin Shengnan. In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he became the head of the Water Patrol Team of the puppet Wu County Police Bureau. After being reported by the Traitor Supervision Team of the Third Front Army's military police, two Mauser pistols, two wooden-holstered pistols, 495 rounds of ammunition, and four pistol holsters were seized from his home. He was detained and transported to Shanghai. Upon arriving at the Shanghai railway station, taking advantage of the unpreparedness of the escorts, including Chen Hairu, he took out the wooden-holster pistol from the transport box and wounded Chen Hairu in the leg while attempting to escape, but was unsuccessful. The defendant argued that he took out the gun to commit suicide and accidentally injured Chen Hairu unintentionally. He denied all accusations during the court's interrogation regarding inspecting ships, extorting donations and taxes, and eliminating our underground workers who were lurking on the water. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Shang Mujang Admits to Collaboration with the Enemy; Formerly Held Positions Such as Head of the Puppet Hangzhou Municipal Police Bureau; Three Defendants, Including Yu Dongsheng, Prevaricate

[Our Newspaper's Report] Shang Mujang is accused of serving as the head of the puppet Hangzhou Municipal Police Bureau in June of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], and later as the vice-chairman of the puppet Huangdao Society, while his son, Shang Jijiang, served as the chief of the General Affairs Section and concurrently as the chief of secret agents of the same society.

Yesterday, the aforementioned four suspected traitors were tried at the High Court. Shang Mujang admitted without hesitation to having held various puppet positions.

### Boatman Wang Shouqing Does Not Admit to Doing Evil

[Our Newspaper's Report] Suspected traitor Wang Shouqing was tried at the High Court yesterday afternoon. He is ostensibly a night-soil barge operator but is accused of serving as the chief of the Fifth Bao of the Fourth District of the Puppet Shanghai Waterways Security System, and later concurrently as a ship crewman for the enemy's 1629 Unit. In June of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], when the enemy army sealed ships, the defendant assigned Xu Likui's ship to transport artillery shells and military supplies to Wu [illegible] to aid Taiwan's defense. The ship was bombed by American aircraft, resulting in the death of crew member Bai Wentian and injuries to worker Lian Kaizha.

### Bursting into Tears, Collapsing Before the Court, Repeatedly Crying for Justice, Continued Trial of a Major Murder Case in Qingpu, Witnesses Gu Nianlin and Others Tragically Narrate the Horrors, Two Defendants, One Evasive and One Feigning Ignorance

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zou Baoxian, the puppet township chief of Xi'an Township, Qingpu County, who is accused of the brutal murder of fifteen people, and Xue Shunde, Chen Amu, Yang Ada, Yu Kesheng, and others, a total of five people, are on trial. Zou Baoxian and Chen Amu are in custody, while the others are still at large. The High Court continued the trial yesterday morning and summoned witnesses Gu Nianlin and Liu Xiaoerzi. Among the fifteen people killed, Huang Gu Nianlin's daughter, Huang Kaishan, and Zhou Zhenghong are Gu's two sons-in-law. Therefore, when Gu Nianlin testified in court yesterday morning, he was extremely grief-stricken. He entered the court and burst into tears, collapsing before the court president, repeatedly crying out for "Justice, Your Honor!" Gu is already 60 years old, with gray hair, wearing an old blue cloth jacket and broken rubber shoes. It is said that the murdered victims had their heads cut off and their bellies cut open, and were buried in two pits, one with nine bodies and the other with six. Zou Baoxian falsely accused the murdered victims of being bandits and sought a reward from Huang Liewen, the puppet county magistrate of Qingpu. Liu Xiaoerzi stated that in the first month of the lunar calendar in the 34th year of the Republic [1945], their small boat was docked near Laozhai River in Xiaoyin Township, Xi'an Township, in the Qingpu County area. While going ashore to collect grass, they had a quarrel with villagers Yang Ada and others and were subsequently surrounded and beaten. Liu Xiaoerzi was able to escape because he was small and unnoticed. He has not seen the other fifteen people since then. When questioned, defendant Zheng Shixian still claimed that they only knew about the villagers fighting with bandits at the time and remained evasive about other matters. Chen Amu kept shaking his head and asking irrelevant questions. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning, and the defendants were returned to custody.

### Provides Explanations Regarding Recent Accusations, Ding Guitang Receives Reporters, Claims That He Does Not Engage in Business, Self-Dealing, or Corruption, Has a Clear Conscience, and Is Not Afraid of Accusations

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ding Guitang, Deputy Chief Secretary of the Customs Administration, invited members of the Shanghai press yesterday afternoon at 4 PM for a private conversation to address recent accusations of collaboration with the enemy and other matters. Mr. Ding recounted his 30 years of service in the customs service, rising from a junior clerk to Deputy Inspector General of Customs. He claimed that he has always been loyal to the country, upright and straightforward, and has repeatedly fought with foreign customs officials for equal rights over the past 30 years, striving for national honor. Regarding the accusation made by a dismissed customs official named Shen, Mr. Ding explained that he remained in Shanghai and continued to work in the customs service for a year after the outbreak of the Pacific War under the orders of the Ministry of Finance to temporarily remain at his post. He believes that Shen's accusation is a malicious slander. After the victory, the Ministry of Finance established a review committee (of which he was not a member) specifically to review customs personnel in the recovered areas. The regulations stipulated that all senior officials who had served in the customs service in the occupied areas, except those who were indeed under enemy and puppet surveillance and unable to leave, would be dismissed. At that time, documents were found showing that Shen had colluded with the enemy and puppet regime while serving as the Customs Commissioner of the Guangzhou Customs, and he was immediately reported to the Ministry of Finance and dismissed and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office. He was later released due to insufficient evidence. After his release from prison, this person repeatedly demanded reinstatement and threatened to make accusations. He ignored him, and therefore, the malicious slander occurred. As for the various accusations listed in his indictment, Mr. Ding explained them one by one yesterday, calling them "nonsense," and claiming that he does not engage in business, self-dealing, or corruption. The residence he lives in and the car he drives are all owned by the customs service. "If I don't work for the customs service for one day, I won't have food to eat for one day." Therefore, he has a clear conscience and is not afraid of accusations. Finally, regarding the report in the newspapers on the 6th of this month about allegations of corruption in the warehouse takeover by the Enemy Property Administration, which implicated him, he stated that this matter not only had nothing to do with him but also had nothing to do with the Jianghai Customs. Therefore, he hopes that society and the press will take a serious stance. Criminals should be punished, but good people should not be embarrassed.

[Another Report] According to Ding Guitang, Deputy Inspector General of Customs of the Customs Administration, the Jianghai Customs has seized approximately 10 billion yuan worth of smuggled goods over the past year through informants, with contraband such as cosmetics being the most common.

### Scope of Confiscation Defined for Enemy and Puppet Regime's Undelivered Postal Packages

### Lively Scene on Sinan Road, Another Thirty-Three Suspects Released on Bail

[Our Newspaper's Report] The detailed implementation measures of the amnesty have not yet arrived in Shanghai. The District Prosecutor's Office continued to process the release on bail yesterday. A total of thirty-three suspects, who are considered relatively minor and certainly within the scope of the amnesty, were released, including three female prisoners. The detention center has released a total of 165 people in the past two days, most of whom are suspected of theft. There are currently approximately 2,000 inmates in the Sinan Road detention center, and it is estimated that over half of them will be eligible for amnesty. Currently, those released on bail are limited to those who have not been prosecuted and are likely to receive a decision not to prosecute. The news of the District Prosecutor's Office releasing prisoners has caused a lively scene at the junction of Sinan Road and Jianguo West Road for several days. The families of the detained defendants are all waiting in the nearby area to greet them. Three-wheeled vehicles and rickshaws, upon hearing the news, have also gathered from various places. As soon as the prison gates open, drivers compete to solicit business. [Another Report] Most of those detained in the detention center are small thieves. Yesterday, several people were approved for release on bail, but since they could not find guarantors, they had to be sent back to the detention center. When these people were being returned, they had smiles on their faces, as life after release would be problematic, and it would be better to be able to eat for free in the detention center.

### Suspicion of Hidden Gold, Truth Can Be Revealed Immediately, Prosecutor Goes to Fuxing Island Again for Third On-Site Inspection

[Our Newspaper's Report] The suspected hidden gold case on Fuxing Island is being jointly investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office, the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Garrison Command. The case has now developed to the final stage. According to relevant sources from the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration yesterday, the truth of the case has already been revealed. The informant's accusations of hidden gold and embezzlement, etc., are actually untrue. The inside story is that the informant fabricated facts and made malicious accusations due to other disputes, so he did not dare to sign his name on the informant's letter. Not long ago, the authorities directly obtained several suspected informants. After comparing their handwriting, new discoveries were made. Therefore, the case will be revealed soon. This morning, Gu Hongbiao, the prosecutor in charge of the District Prosecutor's Office, will once again go to Fuxing Island with Yu Lexing, a specialist commissioner from the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Xuan Dijie from the Garrison Command for a third on-site inspection.

### Quota Allocation Office of the Import Control Committee Explains Reasons for Slow Allocation; Registration and Approval of Importers Not Yet Completed; Number of Imported Goods Applied for is High and Inconsistent with Reality

[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Gan, Director of the Quota Allocation Office of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Committee, stated when meeting with reporters yesterday: Our office is currently stepping up the calculation of quota allocations for several imported goods that require quota allocation by our office. However, due to the fact that the registration and approval of importers has not yet been completed, it is actually very difficult to make a comprehensive quota allocation for various imported goods. Furthermore, the amount of imported goods applied for by various import and export merchants is often unreasonable. For example, in the case of fuel alone, the amount applied for in one quarter has exceeded the total annual requirement. If such applications are approved, the country's foreign exchange resources will be greatly drained, and there is no such need domestically. Therefore, the outside world, not understanding the truth, often condemns our office for deliberately delaying the quota allocation, which is not knowing the true facts. However, our office is now quickly calculating the import quotas for several major imported goods, such as gasoline, diesel, timber, rubber, gum, and wool. Among these, gasoline is simple in nature because its import is concentrated in the hands of three or five large companies. The import quota for the first quarter of this year has also been determined to be 2.5 million US dollars. Within this value limit, each company can independently decide whether to ship gasoline in bulk or in drums. As for the allocation of this quota, except for a very small portion reserved for allocation to small companies, over 90% is delegated to the large companies for independent allocation. However, the companies ultimately believe that the allocation is uneven and still request that our office allocate it on their behalf. In the future, after the quotas for other imported goods are determined, it would be best if the import and export merchants could allocate them independently. Otherwise, our office will have to use the import amount reported by each import and export merchant in the three years before the war and one year after the war as a reference and make a reasonable allocation.

According to the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Import Control Committee, over 4,000 import and export merchants in Shanghai have applied for registration with the Import Control Committee. The figures for other cities are not yet included. The committee is currently stepping up its review. Those who have been approved have been individually notified by the committee with a notification letter. However, the number of approved companies has not yet been finalized. The rumor of 300 companies is completely inaccurate. It is said that the committee will issue a public announcement after the approval is completed.

In the afternoon, the gold price rose sharply, and the situation was still stable. The result was an increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes also showed a slight upward trend. The result was an increase of 20 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose slightly due to the decline in Shanghai telegraphic transfer rates, yesterday at around 1,140 yuan, with slight transactions.

### Man-Made Silk Expected to Arrive, Market Price Increases Have Ceased

Yesterday, because it was rumored that man-made silk would be arriving, price increases in the market ceased.

The asking price was similar to the previous day without any changes. Silk fabrics and quilt covers were particularly weak, and transactions were very rare. Because the raw material costs increased, Hua Jin crepe was offered at 3,600 yuan per yard, but buyers hesitated and watched, resulting in a lack of transactions.

### Hong Kong Branches of Businesses Established with Finance Ministry Approval; Underground Establishments Evade Industry Associations

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to prevent capital flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Shanghai Silver Money Trade Association to instruct all businesses that had established branches in Hong Kong without authorization to close them down within five days of receiving the order and to report the handling situation to the Ministry. Those who disregarded the law would be severely punished. Our reporter inquired with the person in charge of the Silver Money Trade Association about this matter. According to him, the order was received at the end of last year. Although several banks had established branches in Hong Kong, they had all been approved by the Ministry of Finance before their establishment and there were no cases of unauthorized establishment. The Banking Association has already issued circulars to its members based on the Ministry of Finance's order. Shen Rixin of the money exchange business said that, to his knowledge, no money exchanges had established branches in Hong Kong. If they changed their names and established money exchanges in Hong Kong without using the name "branch," they would not need to be approved by the Ministry of Finance and there would be no way to investigate their inner workings. Furthermore, the interest rates in Hong Kong's businesses are currently very low. Some British banks do not even pay interest on deposits, and the interest rate for ordinary banks is approximately one or two percent for deposits and only six percent for loans. Therefore, Shanghai businesses moving to Hong Kong can only maintain their original capital. Unless they have strong financial resources and other plans, there is no need for this. The Money Exchange Association has now issued circulars to its members, but there have been no reports of illegal branches being closed and reported.

### Cotton Yarn Market Increasingly Sluggish; Only 32-Count Stable

It is also heard that the committee is handling production business loans quickly due to their urgent nature. Ordinary cases can be loaned out one week after receiving the documents.

### Rice Supply Decreases; Both Northern and Southern Japonica Rice Prices Rebound

The supply of rice decreased, with only about 5,000 stones arriving from both the north and south. Demand revived, and the prices of both northern and southern Japonica rice rose again by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Common rice was still scarce, and Baiyinyuan rice also rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply of vegetable oil on the oil market was still strong, and demand was also brisk. After an initial decline, prices recovered strongly, eventually rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### Japanese Yarn and Cloth Sold to Hong Kong; Domestic Goods Transported Southward Impacted

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the victory, Southeast Asia had a strong demand for Chinese cotton cloth. However, production was insufficient, so it was temporarily impossible to supply it. Even though the Fujian and Guangdong provinces in South China had transported it in batches, smuggling was still rampant. Recently, Japanese yarn has begun to be transported to Hong Kong, and the price is cheaper than Chinese yarn. According to the transportation industry in this city, cotton yarn was smuggled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong in the past. Now that Japanese yarn is being transported to Hong Kong, it is feared that Hong Kong's cotton yarn will be smuggled to Guangzhou. Also, because Japanese yarn is cheap, Southeast Asian ports such as Singapore and Java, which used to sell Chinese cloth, may be unable to supply it in the future and may be taken over by Japanese cotton cloth. The future of China's Southeast Asian market is quite bleak.

Another report: The Taikoo Steamship Company's Fujian wheel will sail from Shanghai to Kobe on the 16th of this month, carrying a large batch of cotton yarn to Hong Kong.

The price of green sugar fell more sharply due to the large number of arrivals, with Shunde green sugar at 110,000 to 104,500 yuan, Xinghua white sugar at 155,000 to 150,000 yuan, and Xinghua red sugar at 150,000 yuan.

### Central Bank Orders Branches to Unify Handling of Rediscount, Repledge, and Reforwarding of Export Bills

### Book Industry Representatives from Beijing and Shanghai Appeal for Cultural Crisis; Journalists Entertained in the Capital Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing 8th Telegram] The book industry associations from Beijing and Shanghai entertained the press at 3:00 PM on the 8th, including Liu Jikang, Yao Pengzi, Xu Qitang, Xu Xiaoyun, Lu Shizhong, Wang Fenggu, Xu Boxin, and Huang Zhongkang, representatives from Shanghai who came to Beijing to petition, and more than ten reporters. Yao Pengzi first reported on the situation of the Shanghai publishing industry during the occupation and after the victory, saying that the impact of the current political situation, the cost of printing materials has doubled, and the market and purchasing power have decreased, and a major crisis is imminent.

Publishing Institutions Open and Close Randomly

Newly established publishing institutions open and close randomly. Of the 36 who returned from the rear, 10 have been shut down. The publishing industry is different from other industries. Its finished products cannot be rashly increased in price or mortgaged for loans. The sales of finished products are also affected by transportation and timeliness. It is difficult to turnover capital. Last time, they came to Beijing to petition, requesting the government to exempt business tax in order to support culture, but there was no result, so they came to Beijing again to jointly petition with their Beijing counterparts. However, according to unofficial news, textbooks can be completely exempted from business tax, while other books will be taxed at half the rate. Publishing institutions that run textbooks and do not run textbooks are dissatisfied with this. On the one hand, the country's culture cannot be developed solely by relying on textbooks. On the other hand, newspapers can be completely tax-free, and the book industry, which also contributes to culture, should be treated the same.

Efforts to Improve Book Postage

On the 7th, they went to the Direct Taxation Department and the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Communications. In addition to Minister Wang Yunwu expressing his sympathy and promising to convey his opinions, Deputy Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Communications also accepted considerations. The representatives put forward a request to abolish the small package postage method for books promulgated during the war, and immediately invited the responsible personnel of the General Post Office to make inquiries, promising to strive to improve the book postage method in the future within a reasonable range. As for taxation, because the Ministry of Finance is busy dealing with the review of the budget by the Senate, there is no result yet. The representatives will go to the Ministry of Finance again on the afternoon of the 8th to petition, hoping that the media can lend their support and jointly maintain the country's cultural lifeline.

Half-Exemption News Declared Inaccurate

After Yao Ci and Xu Qitang added briefly, Xu Boxin, the petition representative who had just returned from the Ministry of Finance, reported that Vice Minister Li of the Ministry of Finance had two points: First, Li denied that the Central News Agency's report on the full or half exemption of business tax for the book industry was officially released. The Direct Taxation Department has not yet issued this announcement. The Ministry of Finance is still studying and considering this matter and will make a decision as soon as possible. Second, Li affirmed that the "book industry" and the "newspaper industry" are both cultural undertakings, without any doubt.

The Response from the Ministry of Finance is Quite Good

Then Wang Fenggu supplemented the explanation that textbooks and reference books are both necessary in formal education and self-study education and cannot be arbitrarily increased in price. He also stated the embarrassing situation of the book industry's inability to compensate for losses. Vice Minister Li's response was quite good, but he still hoped for media assistance to complete the purpose of the petition. Then the reporters asked questions about printing costs and book sales, and everyone had a feeling of laughing and crying. Xu Boxin also told reporters yesterday that the various bookstores are now busy dealing with the year-end. The representatives from Shanghai are scheduled to return to Shanghai by night train on the 8th.

### Education Bureaus in Various Counties of Guizhou to be Restored Next Month

### Student Unrest at Jianghuai Middle School Leads to Movement to Expel President Wang

[Our Newspaper's Bengbu 8th Telegram] Wang Ziyi, the president of Jianghuai Jia School, is corrupt and domineering, arousing public indignation among alumni and launching a movement to protect the school and expel Wang, requesting the competent authority to dismiss him and elect a capable president.

### Representatives of Municipal Elementary School Principals Association Petitioned the Education Bureau Yesterday

Requesting Announcement of New Salary Standards for Teachers and Staff

### Ji Weihao Appointed as New Principal of Qingnian Elementary School

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Qingnian Elementary School affiliated with the Qingnian Middle School on Linsen Middle Road in this city held a school affairs meeting yesterday (8th), presided over by Pan Gongzhan, the chairman of the school board. In addition to giving instructions on future school affairs, the original principal, Jiang Yuxuan, resigned due to other high positions. It was resolved to appoint Ji Weihao, a school board member, as the principal. The school is well managed, and Ji, who was originally the principal of Qingnian Middle School and has rich academic experience, will definitely have greater development under the leadership of Li in the future.

### Shanghai Middle School Teachers and Staff Association Sends Letter Requesting Emergency Loans from the Council

The Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Association held a board meeting at Yucai Middle School at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and made many important decisions. Regarding the request for assistance from the Municipal Council, the following two opinions were unanimously agreed upon and sent to the Municipal Council in a letter: (1) To improve the lives of teachers, it is still hoped that students will contribute assistance. The name can be set as the Teacher Welfare Fund, and the amount is requested to be determined by the Council. It has been found that the treatment of municipal middle school teachers this semester is only half that of private schools. Fortunately, the Respect for Teachers Fund has slightly supplemented it, and the public sentiment has been slightly calmed. If the facts are ignored in the next semester and the Council ignores and disregards the Association's recommendations, then the municipal school teachers will flock to private schools or switch to other industries, and the Shanghai municipal middle school frontline will be on the verge of collapse; (2) To issue winter clothing subsidies, it is proposed that the government immediately raise funds. The members of the Association previously requested the government to issue a winter clothing subsidy of 500,000 yuan because of the cold weather and the need to add cotton clothing. The mayor stated that if there is a precedent to follow, the municipal government will do its best to allocate it. It has been found that "the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration issued winter clothing expenses of 1 million yuan per person, and the Central Party Department Secretariat and the Supreme National Defense Council issued winter clothing expenses of 500,000 yuan per person," etc., and the news has been widely broadcast, and the facts are ironclad. It is not excessive for the middle school colleagues to request an emergency loan of 500,000 yuan, which can be drawn from the general reserve fund. Once the Council makes a decision, the municipal government can announce it. This is a government special relief that must be provided according to law, reason, and precedent, so as to get through the New Year.

### The City Education Bureau Will Begin Issuing Elementary School Teacher Qualification Certificates Tomorrow; Schools Must Verify Qualification Certificates Before Employing Teachers Next Semester

The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has completed the writing of qualification certificates for national school teachers. Qualified teachers should go to the bureau on the following specified dates, according to their receipt number, to collect their certificates. A printing fee of 500 yuan must be paid. Those who have lost their receipts must have a letter of proof from their serving school, with a photo attached and the number noted. If the number is forgotten, inquire with the bureau and report it as soon as possible for collection: January 10th for numbers 1 to 2000, January 11th for numbers 2001 to 4000, January 12th for numbers 4001 to 6000, January 14th for numbers 6001 to 8000, January 15th for numbers 8001 to 10000.

Another report: Among the 10,000 teachers in public and private elementary schools in this city, those teaching part-time account for slightly more than one-tenth. According to the Education Bureau, over 8,000 teachers have been issued qualification certificates this time, which is sufficient for the employment of teachers in public and private elementary schools throughout the city. Starting next semester, schools must first verify whether teachers have qualification certificates before employing them. Those without certificates will not be allowed to be employed arbitrarily.

### British Expert Mr. Patrick Arrives in China to Promote Sino-British Cultural Exchange

[Our News] Mr. Trelake, newly appointed as a consultant for the English Studies Department of the British Council, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from England and took a train to Beijing in the evening. The main task of Mr. Trelake's visit is to investigate the general situation of English studies in our country so that the British Council can maximize its efforts. The council has established a detailed plan to subsidize universities and normal schools in terms of economy and materials to engage in English research. In recent years, advanced countries have adopted film education as a tool to educate the general public. The council will also widely adopt it for English education to promote cultural exchange between China and Britain. The two countries have a long history of several decades in the study of each other's language and literature. Mr. Trelake's visit will further strive to promote friendly relations between the two countries. Mr. Trelake was born in China and returned to England at the age of six. He studied English at the University of London for many years and taught at Columbia University and Yale University. After the outbreak of the European War, he once wanted to serve in China with the army, so this is his third visit to our country.

### College Basketball Game: Tongji Meets Datong Today, Hujiang Faces Daxia in the Women's Group

The college basketball league will hold a total of three games for men and women starting at 3:00 PM today at the City Gymnasium. Admission is free and visitors are welcome.

The first game, the college group, starts at 3:00 PM, with Gongzhuan facing the China Journalism College. Followed by the women's group at 4:00 PM, Hujiang faces Daxia. The last game, the school group, Tongji meets Datong. Datong narrowly defeated Jiaotong by 49 to 47 in the first game, but due to a player who was a part-time worker and a dropout, they automatically declared their defeat to Jiaotong. Today, they will be extra cautious against Tongji. The school's players are not short of famous players. If the team's Lin Weicong, Ren Yu Xu Shen, etc., have experienced many battles and have rich experience, it should not be difficult to solve the problem at that time. However, Tongji is known as a "dark horse" among the university teams. Although Datong can win, it will undoubtedly pay a considerable price, and there will definitely be many wonderful moments. Today's order of events is recorded below: Gongzhuan - Zhongxin (College) 3:00 PM, Hujiang - Daxia (Women's Group) 4:00 PM, Tongji - Datong (School Group) 5:00 PM.

After the start, Feishuo's Hong Dequan won the first game 15 to 10 with fierce smashes. In the second game, Tiyun's two players fell into a slump, and Feishuo won again 15 to 0. In the last game, Tiyun resisted hard, but still could not resist the opponent's fierce attack, and lost to Feishuo again by 12 to 15.

In the second doubles group, Feishuo's Ni Zhengyi and Cai Shiwen met Tiyun's Pei Sigan and Aisikai. Feishuo's Ni and Cai were skilled and well-coordinated, and defeated Pei and Ai in three straight sets 15 to 9, 15 to 8, and 15 to 2.

In the third group, Feishuo was composed of Wu Chonggong and Wang Zhongcheng against Tiyun's Hai Xuny ou and Qiao Qinsen.

In the second game, Feishuo saw the opponent's weakness and, under a concerted attack, won back a game by 15 to 12, tying the score. In the last game, Feishuo attacked with all their strength, and Tiyun resisted fiercely. Feishuo narrowly won the third game by 15 to 14. The overall result was 8 to 1.

Results from the previous day:

Civil Affairs Briefing

### National Identity Cards are Exempt from Stamp Duty; The Ministry of Interior Notifies the City Government by Telegram

The Municipal Government approved a telegram from the Ministry of Interior, which stated that "previously, the Henan Provincial Government requested the issuance of national identity cards, with stamp duty of 50 yuan affixed in accordance with regulations. The Ministry considers that the national identity cards issued by local governments at all levels in accordance with the Household Registration Law and its Implementation Rules, and other household registration certificates, are all a type of various certificate forms attached to the rules. Judging from their nature, they are the same as the 'household registration certificates' listed in item 23 of the stamp duty law's tax rate table, which are exempt from stamp duty. Furthermore, the national identity cards are intended to be issued universally, and stipulating the collection of costs is already difficult for the country. If we are to order the payment of stamp duty again, I am afraid that the majority of the people will not be able to afford it, which will hinder the implementation of household administration. After requesting the Ministry of Finance to review the matter, the Ministry of Finance approved a public letter stating that national identity cards are certificates for handling household registration, and in accordance with the provisions of item 23 of the stamp duty law's tax rate table, which exempts household registration certificates from stamp duty, they can be exempted from stamp duty. Accordingly, please check" The City Government has issued a notice to all district offices yesterday to comply.

### The Holding of the National Games and Shanghai's Preparation

Whether or not the 7th National Games will be held has been widely reported in the newspapers of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin two months ago, and all contained encouraging messages. Finally, the Ministry of Education issued a side news saying that the National Games will be held in the capital on the Double Tenth Festival next year (that is, this year). Thus, the speculation about the date and location of the National Games came to an end, and the Jingxing government made a clear announcement, but there has been no further news to date. Many enthusiastic friends are vying to ask what is going on, but

Perhaps the government is busy with major political events and has no time for this; or the political situation is not yet completely stable and there are concerns; or there are difficulties in funding; we do not know the exact reason. If it is shelved for the above reasons, I think it is not a reason. The preparation of the Games is handled by technical personnel, which does not conflict with political activities; the participating units of the Games are provinces, cities and special regions, and there is no problem between the provinces, cities and the central government, and it can be guaranteed that 100% of the teams will attend. Even if there are some difficulties in transportation, it is not impossible to solve, and perhaps there will be no difficulties at all in ten months; as for the funds, including the construction of the stadium, it will only cost more than 10 billion yuan, which will definitely not make the finance overwhelmed.

In the year since the restoration, other departments have made considerable achievements, but only sports are still at a loss. We dare not say that the government is unwilling to devote itself to promoting it, but at least dare to say that it has not given the endangered sports a shot in the arm. The National Games can indeed be regarded as a shot in the arm. The sports of all parts of the country are hoping to be activated under this shot, but this shot is held in the hand and is unwilling to be injected. We are anxious, anxious for the endangered sports.

From the perspective of sports administration, the Games are a means, not an end. As long as the government clearly announces that the National Games will be held in the capital on the Double Tenth Festival this year, it is also giving a shot in the arm to the endangered national sports. National sports will be revitalized. What's more, it is not impossible to actually hold it? Time is faster than an airplane, right? The Double Tenth Festival is coming in the blink of an eye. We hope that the government will make a decision, immediately inject the prepared shot in the arm into the sick mouth of sports, and then inject the shot in the arm held in the hand into the sick body of sports.

Shanghai was the host of the previous National Games and also the winner of the previous National Games overall championship. Shanghai sports has never been willing to fall behind. Regardless of whether the National Games can be held on the Double Tenth Festival this year, the Shanghai sports community must prepare to maintain our past glory. The work of preparation naturally needs to be done in different categories, but there should be a comprehensive plan. The entire plan should be formulated by the National Sports Committee of the Education Bureau and the Council of the Sports Association, and the technical problems of each discipline should be handled by expanding the organization based on the committees of the City Sports Association.

What I hope for the preparation work is not like in the past, selecting some outstanding talents a few weeks before the Games, and putting them together. But from now on, pay attention to finding promising talents, and assign responsible instructors to use various methods to test them, and finally organize and train them. If this is not done, not only will new talents be buried, but also from the perspective of the team, we can only get five, nine or eleven good players, but we cannot get a good team.

Shanghai has many enthusiastic sports enthusiasts, experienced instructors, and countless new and old sports talents. If the competent sports administrative agency and sports organizations can cooperate and preside over it, excellent results can be obtained to await the arrival of the National Games. Otherwise, it can also cope with inter-port challenges or expeditions to other cities, and reap the benefits of improving the level of sports. (Wei)

### Zhangjiakou is Under Reconstruction

— Our reporter Yu Zhenji

Zhangjiakou, nearly three months after its restoration, is still in a state of semi-alert. The city is full of bunkers, and iron nets are visible everywhere along the way. After 9 pm, the entire city enters a state of martial law. There is not a single pedestrian on the road, only soldiers wearing leather hats and coats, carrying guns and ammunition, guarding in the severe cold of nearly minus ten degrees. Under the half-lit lights, dragging a long shadow, they appear particularly nervous. The Beijing-Shanghai reporters group once had the following joke in Zhangyuan due to martial law.

### A Photo Becomes a Temporary Pass

It was the evening of December 30th. The reporters group took a small car – perhaps the commander's own car – and left the commander's office after bidding farewell. Under the host's warm hospitality, everyone drank some of the famous wines from outside the Great Wall. On the car, they talked about the tragic situation they saw in Chongli during the day. After the car passed Qinghe Bridge, the streets became narrower and narrower, and the driving gradually slowed down. Just as they were about to make the last turn, the soldier next to the bunker suddenly stopped the car and asked for the password. This stumped the reporters. The only hope was that the driver might know, but unexpectedly, this person was in a hurry to leave and did not pay attention to it in advance. Although the reporters repeatedly explained that they were the Beijing-Shanghai reporters group who came out of the commander's office, the soldiers still refused to let them go because they were executing orders. This standoff lasted for two minutes. Finally, thanks to the quick wit of one of the colleagues, who showed the soldier a large photo of Commander Fu with his autograph that he had given to each of us, they were able to pass smoothly. Afterwards, everyone laughed and said, "I didn't expect Commander Fu's photo to be used as a temporary pass!" The reason why the reporter mentioned this story is just to illustrate that although the entire province of Cai has been recovered, the security authorities have to take precautions against the "scattered Communist troops" everywhere. Even Commander Chuan himself admitted that "the two provinces of Cai and Sui cannot be said to be unthreatened." This unstable situation, of course, has a significant impact on the revival of Zhangyuan and even the entire Cai province. A staff member of a certain bank who is engaged in relief work in Zhangyuan specifically emphasized this point. The reporter and Zhang Ziwen also learned from a reliable source that on the evening of December 29, a sabotage conspiracy was discovered in Zhangyuan, but fortunately it was discovered in advance and suppressed.

Unable to Distinguish Commanders from Soldiers

Despite the fact that the entire territory of Caiha has not been completely stabilized, and despite the fact that Zhangjiakou is still under some large or small threats, all of this cannot prevent the provincial authorities from making efforts to revitalize. In conversations with a dozen people who entered Zhang with the army, they almost unanimously praised the rapid revival of Zhangyuan in the period of less than three months. A car driver told the reporter that when the National Army first entered Zhangyuan, landmines were buried everywhere in the city, especially along the highways and factories. Now the mine-sweeping work has been completed. Initially, all the electric lights in the city were destroyed, but now, relying on an aging and dilapidated 10,000-watt machine, the city can see light again at night, and the wheels of the flour mill have begun to turn out bags of mixed flour.

Those who are promoting these works are all people who are devoted to their work and do not seek fame. Some of them are noble chairmen and directors, and some have studied abroad, but they only wear two kinds of uniforms: one is a grass-yellow cotton military uniform, with a leather hat with upturned sides, which looks like a junior officer from a distance; the other is a black cotton uniform (rarely woolen). Because their clothing is so simple, they are often mistaken by reporters. Zhou Jun, the mayor of Zhangjiakou, did not attract attention when he greeted reporters at the airport because he wore "coarse cloth clothes". Bai Baozhang, the director of the Finance Department of Cai Province, also told reporters that when he accompanied Commander Chuan to the capital last time, he was afraid that his black cotton uniform would be unsightly, so he rushed to make some new clothes.

The treatment of general civil servants is very poor, especially those transferred from Huanyuan, who are only given a subsidy of 30,000 yuan per person. They work in the situation of lack of money and people. After the opening of the Pinghuan Road, the prices in Zhangjiakou have almost caught up with those in Pingjin, but in this adjustment of civil servant treatment, Pingjin, Beijing and Shanghai are listed as the first level, while Zhangjiakou is the third level, the same as Lansui, which is too unfair. Director Bai and others hope that the reporters can appeal on their behalf. But they explained that at this time when the national economic situation is difficult, it is right for civil servants to suffer temporarily, as long as the work they do is beneficial to the country and the nation, they are willing to have less money. These words are enough to represent the meaning of the majority of civil servants in Cai Province, and the revival of the entire Zhangjiakou and even Cai Province is built on this firm will.

### Rising from the Ruins

As a reporter who grew up in Shanghai and has traveled extensively throughout the northwestern and southwestern provinces since the Anti-Japanese War, I have seen many major cities in the rear. However, few can compare to Zhangjiakou in terms of the sheer number of smokestacks. The Chinese and foreign reporters traveling with me this time were also unanimously astonished by Zhangjiakou's solid industrial foundation. The pity is that the destruction was so severe. On the way from the airfield to the city, we passed countless broken walls and ruins, as if we were walking through the Jiangwan area of Shanghai.

According to reliable investigations, there are a total of seventy-seven industrial and electrical institutions in Chahar Province. Ten are factories, nine are semi-factories, and fifty-eight are small-scale and still operate as side businesses. Forty of these are located in Zhangjiakou, and almost all forty were completely destroyed. It is no wonder that Chief Fu said with deep sorrow: "Destruction is easy, but construction is difficult. The destruction that the Communist Party accomplished in one night or half a day, we have yet to fully recover from."

Having said that, after nearly three months of effort, the debris has been cleared, the smokestacks have been erected, and the wheels of some factories have begun to turn again. According to the investigation, out of the above-mentioned seventy-seven units, fifty-four have been reorganized, and twenty-three are in the process of being reorganized. Among them, nineteen can resume work as soon as the electricity supply is no longer a problem. Seventeen cannot be restored at all, and for the rest to resume work, the buildings and machinery must be extensively repaired. In addition, the authorities have also rushed to transport and collect 600 tons of machinery and equipment (mostly incomplete) from the area bordering the Communist army. More than 100 tons have already been transported back, and the rest is being rushed back.

The Most Serious Electricity Problem

People in Beijing and Shanghai who curse the electricity company for a one or two-minute power outage cannot imagine the severity of the electricity shortage in Zhangjiakou. Zhangjiakou was not without electricity before. During the Japanese occupation, there were plans to establish a 65,000-kilowatt power supply network in Chahar, of which 40,000 kilowatts had been completed. The most famous was the Xiahuayuan Power Plant (where the Japanese built a 20,000-kilowatt generator). However, after three destructions, Zhangjiakou had less than 1,000 kilowatts of electricity left. Because the wheels of the factory cannot turn without electricity, tens of thousands of workers are unemployed. Because there is no electricity, the millstones of the flour mill cannot be turned, and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of ordinary people are affected. During the reporter's short stay in Zhangjiakou, we visited the only remaining power plant for half an hour.

According to Section Chief Zhang, the machines used in the plant were already discarded by the Japanese. After the restoration, they were found again and repaired. The smokestacks were moved from elsewhere. Because it is an old and broken machine, it can only generate 312 kilowatts, which of course cannot bear the entire power supply task. To this day, not many businesses in Zhangjiakou use electricity. This veteran of the electricity industry led us to see the boiler and pointed to the coal in the warehouse and said to us: "Although the boiler is a product of Westinghouse, it is already old. And the coal, you see, turns into slag as soon as it is burned and must be washed very often. We start the furnace at 5 pm every day, rest at 12 pm to clean the furnace, and start again at 1 am and burn until 5 am. Then we start again at 8 am and burn until 3 pm, so that both homes and factories have electricity, especially the flour mill. Flour is too important. How can the people live without flour!"

He told us that Datong may have two broken 3,000-kilowatt machines that can be moved here, and they can be started with another 60 to 70 million yuan. The National Resources Commission may also move a 500-kilowatt machine here. When all of them are started, there will be 3,000 kilowatts. If so, it will not be difficult for match factories, cigarette factories, etc. to gradually resume work. The Xiahuayuan Power Plant has been taken over by the National Resources Commission. You Lingyun and all the staff sent by the commission arrived on the 20th of last month. The first step is to check the damage, and once completed, they can begin repairs and replacements. Because the damage is not too severe, it is hoped that the old appearance can be restored in two or three months. At that time, the power generation will reach 10,000 kilowatts, which can be supplied to Xuanhua and other places in addition to Xiahuayuan and Zhangjiakou.

Equally important as electricity is coal. After entering winter, the climate in Zhangjiakou is always below ten degrees Celsius. A reporter's ink bottle hidden in the box also cracked due to the cold. The beards of the elderly on the street were covered with ice beads. It is impossible to keep warm without coal. The largest coal mine near Zhangjiakou is the Baoxing Coal Mine. Chief Fu recently allocated 30 million yuan in working capital to help rebuild it. The mine has more than 1,000 workers, and their work enthusiasm is extremely high. Each load of coal is enough for 400 catties. Many farmers also use their slack farming time to mine coal as a side business. Currently, 300 tons of bituminous coal and anthracite coal can be produced every day. If the electricity in Xiahuayuan is restored, and all four pits produce coal, the output can be increased to more than 400 tons. The mine also generates its own electricity and has installed more than 200 lights, the brightness of which can be compared with that of Zhangjiakou.

The provincial government recently sent personnel to Xiahuayuan to inspect the mining affairs and business of various mines to prepare for increased production. Certain effective measures will also be taken for mine safety, so the coal shortage problem in Zhangjiakou and other places will soon be resolved.

### The Major Artery Beats Again

The PingSui Railway, designed and funded by the Chinese themselves, has recently been fully opened to traffic again. This is very important for the revitalization of Zhangjiakou.

The rush repair work on the Zhangjiakou section of the PingSui Railway was completed on December 12th. On that day, the east and west rush repair teams connected the rails in Luowenzao, and the work of opening the entire PingSui Railway was completed. Since the 21st of last month, there have been two trains each day between Zhangjiakou, traveling back and forth once, which has greatly facilitated passenger transport.

The PingSui Railway suffered considerable war damage. The railway once conducted a general investigation of this, and turning over the loss list now is still shocking and makes one's hands tremble. The reporters went to the railway station to visit. The station was full of lime for repairing the houses, and several red and green track-pressing cars were parked on the rails. The offices were empty, and the scene was desolate enough. After asking around three or five times, we found a Deputy Station Master Chen on duty, who was also busy making phone calls. Four or five merchants were standing next to him. The room was not big enough, and the addition of four or five reporters made it even narrower.

"Yesterday, we loaded seven cars of leather and grain. I'm afraid there will be more today. The customers are urging us very urgently. You have to find a way..." The Deputy Station Master shouted into the phone. The customers standing next to him looked at him with anxious eyes. The phone call lasted for three full minutes, during which several more customers came in. Finally, the Deputy Station Master saw that we had been waiting for too long and asked us to sit down. The first thing he said was: "I'm really too busy. I'm very sorry to have kept you waiting."

According to him, Zhangjiakou has a considerable backlog of goods, and customers are urging them very closely. Because there are no train cars available, the goods cannot be shipped out for three or four days. The main items shipped from Zhangjiakou to Beiping are white flour, millet, yellow rice, pork, and other items. Recently, the Chief Headquarters verbally notified that large-scale exports of grain and meat are prohibited, but small quantities are still being shipped out, about three or four train cars per day. The items shipped from Beiping are mainly cloth, sundries, and machinery parts, and the quantity cannot be estimated.

On the western section, although it has been opened to traffic, no trains run at night for safety reasons, and there are not many passenger transports. The main items loaded from the Datong area are food and coal, and most of the coal is produced in Kouquan.

The main difficulties at present are the lack of locomotives and train cars. The bridges along the line are all temporarily repaired and must be greatly repaired in the spring. Because of the lack of water and the poor quality of the coal, trains are often delayed by one or two hours, sometimes even by a day. In the past, trains could travel at 60 or 70 li per hour, but now they can only travel at 20 or 30 li per hour at the fastest, and only 10 li per hour at the worst, which is almost as fast as walking. After the PingSui Railway was opened to traffic, it had both good and bad effects on Zhangjiakou. On the good side, the materials between Zhangjiakou and Jin, Sui, and Ji provinces are connected through this railway. On the bad side, the prices in Zhangjiakou are gradually leveling with those in Pingjin, and the people feel the heavy pressure of life. The fur in Zhangjiakou was originally quite cheap. After the opening of the railway, because many people from Pingjin came to Zhangjiakou to purchase goods, the price increased. The famous grapes used to sell for only 200 yuan per catty, but now they have risen to more than 1,000 yuan per catty. In addition, after the PingSui Railway was opened to traffic, it also transported some American cigarettes and other things, but fortunately, the quantity is not too large.

In addition to the railway, the highways near Zhangjiakou have also been completely repaired. The Longguan-Chicheng highway, which was recently repaired, had a test drive on December 27th, and the results were good.

Current Status of the Fur Industry and Commerce

Based on the reporter's observation in Zhangjiakou for two days, although the commercial situation in Zhangjiakou is quite sluggish, it is generally stable. At the very least, a crisis like the one in the industry and commerce of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin will not occur by the end of the Gregorian calendar or the end of the lunar calendar. Regarding this point, the reporter asked the locals, and their explanation was: Zhangjiakou has not been recovered for three full months, and everything is still in the process of repatriation. The only thing that is felt lacking is insufficient funds, and there are no other serious problems.

Driven by curiosity, the reporters paid considerable attention to the fur industry in Zhangjiakou. On the day of departure, we went to several of the largest fur stores to take a look.

According to people familiar with the industry: The fur business has been quite good in the past half month. In addition to the retail sales of fur coats and robes, because the weather is getting colder, and food carts from outside the port are entering the country, farmers and vendors running outside the port are buying fur trousers and fur coats, so fur is generally more liquid. The price of coarse fur is about 120,000 yuan for large pieces and about 100,000 yuan for small pieces. As for raw fur and various types of hair, because merchants from Tianjin do not come to purchase them, they are still quite sluggish.

In addition to the fur industry, the main export products of Zhangjiakou include food, medicinal materials, and other items. Recently, because farmers inside and outside the port came to Zhangjiakou to sell grain, the amount of grain on the market has increased from more than 1,000 shi to 1,100 shi per day. The main miscellaneous grains such as wheat, millet, corn, and sorghum have fallen by 500 to 1,000 yuan per shi. Grain merchants from Beiping and eastern Chahar, due to transportation difficulties, no longer greedily purchase, and supply exceeds demand, and grain prices have fallen accordingly, especially oil grains such as sesame seeds and rapeseed, with the price falling from 43,000 to 44,000 yuan per shi to 35,000 to 36,000 yuan, a difference of as much as 10,000 yuan. Wheat sales are still smooth, and the price remains at 30,000 yuan.

Zhangjiakou is a distribution center for goods and does not have much consumption itself. When goods arrive, they are often crowded, which easily leads to price drops. Recently, foreign goods such as kerosene and cigarettes have fallen in price due to excessive imports, and some are even cheaper than those in Pingjin. When the reporters were in Zhangjiakou, the price of kerosene was 220,000 yuan per large bucket, and the price of cigarettes fell to about 100,000 yuan per large box. The best-selling product on the market is Shanghai-made coffee. Small Hadtan and Single Knife cigarettes are selling very slowly, and no one cares about the cigarettes produced by the local cigarette factory in Zhangjiakou. This situation is no different from that in other places.

Satisfactory Education Repatriation Results

In the entire reconstruction process of Zhangjiakou, the results of education repatriation are the most satisfactory. Mayor Zhou proudly reported to the reporters the situation of how primary and secondary schools in Zhangjiakou were gradually reopened within one or two weeks. Zhangjiakou originally had thirty-nine primary schools, and now all of them have been reopened. The number of faculty and staff has also increased from 193 to 235, the number of classes has also increased by 38, from 158 to 196, and the number of students has also increased from 7,100 to 7,727, an increase of 627. This nearly 10,000 primary school students may not seem surprising in Beijing and Shanghai, but please remember that the current total population of Zhangjiakou is less than 140,000 (only more than 120,000 at the beginning of the restoration), and the proportion of primary school students is not small.

The authorities are very concerned about the teachers in the primary schools and have successively allocated 110,000 yuan in temporary relief funds. Recently, the Ministry of Education has also allocated 15 million yuan as relief funds for unemployed teachers and out-of-school youths, which will undoubtedly be a small supplement to the hard-working teachers.

Zhangjiakou originally had four secondary schools, and now the Provincial Middle School and the Provincial Normal School have resumed classes. In order to provide relief to out-of-school youths, the Provincial Middle School was approved to increase the number of classes, and recently held a new student examination. In addition, Saibei Middle School is also preparing to reopen. Chief Fu promised to help recover the school property and raise funds, and classes may be opened in the spring.

### A Night of Wild Revelry at the Empty School

— Hangzhou, January 5th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of this newspaper

During the day on New Year's Eve of the 35th year, more than 30 Stearman training aircraft that had crossed the Hump formed a large formation of the words "Thirty-Six" in the sky over Hangzhou. This was to tell the citizens of Hangzhou: "The 36th year has arrived. What will we use to welcome it?"

That night, the cradle of the Chinese Air Force—Jianqiao Air Force Officer School—had a grand gathering, and I was invited to attend. Accompanying me were Mr. Sun, Director of the Zhejiang Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Mr. Zhu Xiujue, Deputy Director. We passed through the busy Jianqiao Highway and through the guards of the Air Force School, directly to the front of the Air Force School's auditorium. The tall Western-style building was adorned with two Arabic numerals "36" built of electric torches. All the buildings around the school and the equipment on the airfield were brightly lit, as if the cradle of the Chinese Air Force had been embellished with jewels.

Laughter and the Smell of Alcohol

The car stopped, the door opened, and smartly dressed Air Force officers greeted us. We signed our names on white silk, took off our coats, passed through the auditorium, and arrived at the reception room where we used to come often. It was already full of guests. There were noble female guests and valiant Air Force officers. We were led to Denglou, and many people had arrived before us. Director Zhu Huanshou of the Political Department warmly shook hands and introduced their senior Air Force officers and their wives. Director of Education Hu Weike also came and said with a smile, "You're here, that's great. We were just trying to pick you up!"

Allied land and air officers also came one after another. They brought their beautiful wives and girlfriends. Director Hu's wife was wearing a short cheongsam made of purple-red wool and high-heeled shoes with black lace flowers, greeting the guests back and forth. Secretary-General Lei Fazhang of Zhejiang Province Chairman Shen Chengzhang and Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Qiyu also came together. A burst of pleasant laughter vibrated in the building.

Toasting and Wishing Each Other Progress

The banquet was Chinese cuisine, from Lou Wai Lou. The host of our table was Mr. Zhao Shan, Deputy Director of the Education Department. He diligently urged us to drink. He said that his wife could not drink, but she had already drunk seven or eight cups. Director Hu came to toast again. He has a hearty and straightforward personality and drank many cups in one breath. Director Shi Zhu came to toast again, which aroused the guests' reciprocation, especially some Allied officers. They used absolutely overwhelming gestures to toast the host and the Chinese guests. This powerful force was finally resisted, "Ha, ha, ha;" A burst of "Hahahaha" filled the outdoors.

Deputy Director Zhao had already drunk more than seventy cups. He repeatedly told me that an aviation club should be established in Hangzhou City so that the public and the Air Force can become one. He said: "Foreigners have a really strong interest in aviation, but many Chinese people still regard it as a dangerous road." Therefore, he advocated promoting aviation interest, promoting the aviation industry, and promoting aerial activities. He grabbed my arm and said, "This matter requires a lot of advocacy!"

Chairman Shen stood up and said, "I just came back from a foreign county today. It should have been New Year's Eve, and I should have spent it at home, but the Air Force School is like our home. As soon as I unloaded my luggage, I rushed over. We have seen the Chinese Air Force gradually grow, and we feel unparalleled excitement. Today I want to toast and wish the Chinese Air Force health and progress, and the Allied people health and progress." The sound of clinking glasses and toasting rose again, forming another wave of joyful enthusiasm.

Participating in a Music and Dance Party

The wine was waning, and every lady's face seemed to be painted redder. The male guests were also drunk. We were invited to participate in a music and dance party. When we went downstairs through the auditorium, the aviation school theater troupe was performing Cao Yu's "Wilderness." The auditorium was black and crowded with people, and it was quiet and silent. We poked our heads into the auditorium, and the clear lines were heard clearly.

Is this a library? The dance hall was temporarily decorated. The beautiful lights were like bathing in warm springs. Strips of blue with white flower clusters added to the infinite beauty in the dance hall. The women's band played music, and Mayor Zhou and an Allied lady took the lead in dancing, followed by Director Hu and his wife. An elderly foreign lady in a small lounge asked: "Shall we go dancing?"

Director Hu's Mother

After Director Hu finished dancing, he introduced me to his mother, who turned out to be this elderly foreign lady. I realized that she was British. She pulled me to sit on the sofa where she was sitting. She said, "After my child was born, many British friends asked me why I let him go to a Chinese school? I said he was Chinese anyway!" She told me that she loved China, she loved the freedom and peace of the Chinese people, and she believed that China had a future and hope. She also told me: "Look at these many Air Force officers, how innocent, lively, and enthusiastic!"

Director Hu also told me that he hoped to introduce all the officers and students of the school, rather than introduce himself, because he was being seduced by the innocent, lively, and enthusiastic lovely feelings of these many officers and students. Yes, these many Air Force officers and students love freedom very much? But their freedom is the freedom of the great nation. If anyone infringes on the freedom of the great nation, they will sacrifice their own freedom to exchange for the freedom of the great nation. They love the freedom of the country and the nation, and it can even be said that they also love the freedom of mankind.

An officer told me: "Don't look at how naughty we are tonight. During peacetime training, we don't have the same treatment as Allied air force training. When fighting, it is the same as the life of ordinary civilians. China itself is fundamentally poor, and we cannot aim too high. During the construction process, everyone has to suffer!"

Mayor's Accurate Dancing Posture

Mayor Zhou danced with Director Hu's wife again. The dance hall was crowded with people, probably forty or so couples. Director Hu went to dance for a while, then came to the lounge to greet the guests, and then sat on the tables and chairs around the dance floor. The officers were sending tangerines, handing them one by one to the guests' hands.

I said to Mayor Zhou with a smile: "Your dancing posture and dance method are very accurate." Mayor Zhou said: "Thank you, I am following the strict dancing rules." I said to Director Hu's wife again: "Mrs. Hu dances really well." She said with a smile: "You haven't danced with me, how do you know I dance well?" Fortunately, Director Sun relieved the siege by saying: "He is an appraiser!"

Happy, excited, and wild New Year's Eve of the Air Force Officer School in 1946.

The night grew deeper, and I wanted to go back. Mayor Zhou asked the reporter to stay again and come back together. Director Hu pulled the reporter and said: "Don't go, let's dance for a while? I'll send a car to take you back later."

Returning, the innocent, lively, and enthusiastic shadows of the revelry kept playing in my mind. Especially the two Arabic numerals "36" in front of the auditorium, I really don't know what to use to welcome the arrival of this 36th year!

### On "Reason and Democracy"

— A Traditional Perspective First

By Zhang Dongsun Published by The Commercial Press

"The more the words 'democracy' become clichés, the further we stray from the true realization of democracy."

This book was completed by Mr. Zhang when the War of Resistance against Japan had just ended. It can be said to be a theoretical work on China's future. The problems discussed are more specific than in his previous two works (namely, Knowledge and Culture and Thought and Society). However, I still believe that Mr. Zhang is discussing China's future from principles. Therefore, there are two points he can grasp: first, the world must have peace; second, China must have democracy. These are principled recognitions, and everyone should acknowledge these principles.

Mr. Zhang puts it well that democracy is not just a political system but a distinctive civilization. In other words, democracy is not merely a slogan shouted by a few but should be a genuine way of life. This habit should not be a mechanical blind obedience but should be guided by human reason.

The theme of this book can be summarized into four points: (1) The progress of human civilization should be guided by reason; (2) Individuals should consciously express their personality; (3) Humanity should use reason to handle human affairs; (4) Humanity should promote the democratic spirit of freedom and equality. Finally, Mr. Zhang uses these principles to solve China's national issues.

(1) Progress of Civilization

Mr. Zhang divides human history into three periods: The first period is before human history, when people were hidden in the depths of unconsciousness, with a mental knot of a "threat of death." They could only appeal to religion; they obeyed, they worshipped, and they found peace in the belief in the immortality of the soul. The second period is from the beginning of history to the last one or two hundred years. People in this period were psychologically threatened by life, a life of mutual plunder and struggle. During this period, society trained people to have all kinds of cunning, treacherous, cruel, and hypocritical psychologies. People were strong bullying the weak, rich oppressing the poor, and clever deceiving the foolish. This kind of society is a "sick society," and such civilization is an ugly civilization. Now, sprouts have emerged outside the second period, and the third period is about to begin. This period is the flourishing of science and the rise of reason. Mr. Zhang said: "In the second period, it is almost entirely a sick society and an ugly civilization. Fortunately, reason is gradually squeezed out, pushed out, and forced out of it. And the more it is squeezed out, the bigger it becomes, and the more it is forced out. Reason is released from a narrow crevice, but it does not manage to turn around like a sea-searching lamp and still shines on the crevice itself. The usefulness of reason does not lie entirely in being able to envision the future and propose a rational society and a rational life, but rather in being able to expose and reveal the maladies of society and the shortcomings of human nature." The civilization of this period is scientific communism, "the order of which comes from objective natural evolution and does not require a predetermined formula." This seems to be greatly influenced by Bergson's theory of creative evolution, except that Bergson's main force is the "vital force," while Mr. Zhang's is the "force of reason" or "intellect."

(2) Personality and Human Nature

The progress of civilization must have spiritual freedom, and to have spiritual freedom, personality must be established. Therefore, Mr. Zhang said, "These three are inseparable." The concept of personality is the center of Western culture and the foundation for establishing Western democracy. Mr. Zhang quoted Lu Jinba in his "History of European Liberalism":

"Freedom is the self-awareness of oneself and one's infinite spiritual value, so it must also recognize that others have the same. Only those who feel free themselves can recognize the freedom of others."

I should be aware that I am a person, and I have the privilege of being a human being. Since I have my human rights, then we should also feel that others are also human beings, and they should also have human rights. The concept of freedom and equality is established in the process of developing this self-awareness. This is the characteristic of Western civilization. In Chinese civilization, what is similar to this is the Confucian concept of "human relations." Therefore, the question for those who pay attention to the future of Chinese culture is how to integrate the Confucian concept of personality with the concept of personality in Western democratic culture.

(3) Reason and Logic

"Reason" can be explained from two aspects. On the one hand, it can be explained as reason, which refers to human's understanding of the natural world or society. This wisdom includes two aspects: one is to understand the causal relationship of things and predict the effects of things from this causal relationship; the other is to extract the logical relationship of things and seek the meaning of known things from the process of deduction. This belongs to the intellectual aspect, and it is constantly developing and increasing. On the other hand, the term "reason" can also be explained as the reasonable attitude in human relations, which belongs to the attitude of being a person. Usually, we say that someone's actions are very reasonable. Nowadays, people who are reasonable are not necessarily knowledgeable, while people who are knowledgeable are often not reasonable to others. This kind of reason is eternal. This kind of reason can only be understood and cannot be passed on by words. Westerners value wisdom, while Chinese people value reason. Therefore, Mr. Zhang advocates that China must revive the traditional "style of reasoning" in the future, and at the same time, it must hone its reason and improve its ideals like Westerners.

(4) Freedom and Democracy

Freedom is a moral concept. Freedom is the rational combination between people. The more rational, the more free. Mr. Zhang said: "Chinese people think that democratic systems easily cause trouble, that freedom is indulgence and casualness, and that equality is the high accommodating to the low. But they do not know that these are completely wrong... It should be known that freedom, equality, and democracy are all moral disputes. But morality is not about blaming others, but about disciplining oneself. There must be a democratic spirit in one's blood vessels and dantian. One must have the intention of accommodating others and establishing oneself in every action, so as to form a democratic society... Democracy must be integrated with life... and it must be known that it is impossible for oneself to be undemocratic and hope that others will practice democracy. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for political parties. To do this, one must thoroughly stand on rationalism, because reason and morality are fundamentally one."

The above is a brief description of Mr. Zhang's views. I think this brief description may be helpful to those who read Mr. Zhang's original works, because Mr. Zhang's thoughts are too abundant when he writes, and he often pulls them too far, which can easily make readers feel like they are lost in a fog. Mr. Zhang himself is well aware of this, so it is beneficial to readers to bring up his theme and talk about it. Below, we are prepared to express some opinions on this book in terms of its content, method, and narrative attitude to seek correction from Mr. Dongsun and all readers.

Regarding the theoretical content of Mr. Zhang, we completely agree with the theme. For example, he said that democracy means that individuals must have freedom in their habits, thoughts, and spirits, and that individual freedom is to act rationally in the crowd, which we completely agree with. However, we feel that Mr. Zhang has not fully developed his theory on the relationship between freedom and democracy, and between freedom and reason. If democracy is regarded as a way of life, then anyone with a democratic spirit must be able to make his own decisions about his habits, thoughts, and emotions without blindly following others, let alone being mechanically controlled by others; and he will not wantonly control or undermine the initiative of others' habits, thoughts, and emotions. But what kind of person can truly be autonomous? What kind of person can truly make others autonomous? An autonomous person is not indulgent or casual. A truly autonomous person is someone who has a clear understanding of all things, whose choices are reasonable, and whose actions are meant to produce the greatest benefit for the development of human culture. He has knowledge, has unique insights, is reasonable, and pursues welfare. A person who makes others truly autonomous should help others to gain a clear understanding of the situation, have the wisdom to distinguish right from wrong, and have a sincere intention to put oneself in others' shoes. So I have an idea that I think politicians cannot be truly democratic, because an experienced politician always hopes that others will believe in his views, obey his organization, and abide by his discipline. I think the person who truly has a democratic spirit is an educator, but this educator is not an educator who only lectures, but an educator who helps others improve their reason in dealing with people and the world. If politicians can be democratic, then they must help others in the attitude of an educator so that they are good at using their wisdom, careful in deciding what to choose, and pursue the welfare of the public from an autonomous position.

I think that Mr. Zhang's failure to express himself freely in terms of theoretical content is related to his research method. The method used by Mr. Zhang to solve problems is the method of doing scholarship. The so-called method of doing scholarship is that Mr. Zhang uses the historical method on the one hand, that is, Mr. Zhang seeks a way out from the evolution trend of history. We agree with this, but we feel that Mr. Zhang pays too much attention to the evolution of historical thoughts and doctrines and not enough to find a path from the evolution of social life and social psychology. Another method used by Mr. Zhang is the comparison method of the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western cultures, which is also correct, but what he compares are still a few special concepts of Chinese and Western cultures. As for how these special concepts are produced from their special social backgrounds, Mr. Zhang has not given us a more detailed indication. Therefore, we feel that Mr. Zhang is still doing scholarship and not solving practical problems.

Mr. Zhang is one of the people I admire most in the Chinese academic circle. My respect for him is unquestionable, and he should have his own arrogance, but in this book, his attitude towards people seems to be lacking in humility when he discusses problems, which is what I want to say to Mr. Zhang. For example, he said: "Except for Mr. Zhang Junmai, I am afraid that I am the most qualified person in the country to speak about democracy in his words." Also, for example: "My opinions on these issues are more complicated, and cannot be exhausted in a few words... Readers must be patient in order to understand my views." Also, for example, saying: "This is my original idea." Although these are minor flaws, they have a great impact on the reader's psychology. Also, for example, "Except for Ma Yifu, Liang Shuming, Xiong Shili, etc., who still have the demeanor of a scholar-gentleman, there are simply fewer and fewer of them," this statement also seems to be too specific. I wonder what Mr. Zhang thinks?

### Map of Chinese Topography

— Sun Panshou

Compiled by the Chinese Historical and Geographical Chart Compilation Society Published by Yaguang and Dixue Society

To make a map, it must be rough enough to give people a clear impression, and detailed enough to find multiple meanings from it. It is as difficult as writing a painting that is suitable for viewing from a distance and can also be appreciated up close. This map is made by the author, who integrates excellent cartographic techniques and profound geographical knowledge, into a "Three-Dimensional Topographical Map of China," which is both complete and beautiful.

This map uses the three-dimensional depiction method to represent the topography. The general trend of the rivers and mountains of the whole country is clear at a glance. Mountains, plateaus, hills, basins, and plains are all displayed on the map according to their actual shapes and positions, which is enough for readers to carefully observe and study. Looking at this map, it is like looking at a photograph of our country, which stretches over 10 million square kilometers, and you get a real feeling.

Photographs show the appearance of people, and color photographs further render the true colors of people, making them look more vivid. This map has not forgotten to add various natural colors to itself. In the Kangzang area, high mountains above 5,000 meters are covered with snow all year round. These places are covered with white on the map. Plateaus, mountains, and hills with lower altitudes are dyed gray, ocher, or yellow according to their original colors. The plains are generally covered with green. Waterways, lakes, and oceans are printed in light blue or dark blue according to their depth. Therefore, this map is also unintentionally a color photograph of the landform of China. Paying attention to these natural colors, the actual scene of each place will inevitably appear in your mind. In addition, the map shows the national boundaries, provincial boundaries, and important cities, which is especially helpful for people who are new to reading maps.

In the lower right corner of the map, there is an explanation of three to four thousand words, written by Mr. Lu Cunhe. It gives a concise description of the characteristics of the national topography, the division of topographical regions, and the method of reading maps. Readers who study the explanation while looking at the map will definitely gain a further understanding of the Chinese topography.

Now, many geography teachers are suffering from the lack of suitable wall charts when they talk about the topography of this map. The publication of this map is really good news for them. The general public has always had a very vague concept of the topography of their own country. This map can at least show them the outline of the national landform, so that they can absorb a little more geographical meaning than looking at a wall chart of one color per province. The purpose of my writing this short introduction is to let readers know this noteworthy news first. The benefits of this map cannot be fully stated in just a few hundred words. Fortunately, it will be published soon. If you want to understand its true value, please read the original map in detail.

### "Fear and Courage"

— Chen Shu

A War History in the Form of a Novel

By Beck Published by the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House

Things of special significance in the world will always occupy space in history, as a kind of alarm or reference for future generations. Therefore, history is like a mirror, which can reflect all kinds of things in the past. When we think back to October 1941, when the German bandits used "blitzkrieg tactics" to advance towards the Soviet capital step by step, and Moscow was in imminent danger; but because of the Soviet army's calm resistance, the Battle of Moscow finally became a turning point for victory, we will definitely wonder what the key was in between. Then "Fear and Courage" can tell you. This is a record of war events written in the style of a novel, narrated by Bavourzhang and Morsh Ulei, the commanders of the Moscow defense at the time, and recorded by Beck.

It tells us that at that time, the German bandits used a large number of troops to attack Moscow, while the Soviet army was far behind in number. The mission of Ulei's battalion was to use one battalion—about seven hundred soldiers—to defend a six-kilometer section of the highway at the gate of Moscow, so that the German army could not drive straight in. Because the number of troops was so disparate, Ulei could not help but win by wisdom; he pondered day and night, deliberating on all the tactics he had envisioned. In the war, he also learned the experience that "argument in war is not like argument in logic and mathematics. In war, it is proved by blood." At the same time, there was always a kind of fear in his heart constantly fighting with reason, and he tried his best to make reason overcome fear. As the war progressed, the Soviet army's positions were breached in several places by the German army, and Ulei's battalion of soldiers was gradually surrounded. In terms of the situation, his battalion of troops was in great danger of being wiped out, but he did not receive an order to retreat. A contradiction arose in his heart again: If he persisted, he might be wiped out. If he retreated, there was no order. When he thought of "honor is more valuable than life," his problem was solved again; at the same time, he also remembered his superior, Commander Panfilov's conversation with him, which also encouraged and guided him. He made his spirit rejuvenate, and he insisted on the end with the German bandits with wisdom, and did not retreat without an order. In order to inspire morale and protect the noble soldiers, he often used Panfilov's words of "take care of soldiers, not with empty words, but with actions and firepower" to warn himself.

In the snow and ice, under the bombing of German aircraft, and in the German army's attack, Ulei used a calm mind to deal with everything. Finally, he received Panfilov's order that he had to retreat. Under the leadership of Ulei, Ulei's battalion of soldiers safely withdrew from the dangerous area "with care and protection using action and firepower." Because his containment of the German army made their actions inconvenient, the Soviet army gained an advantage in time, and the Soviet army's reinforcements arrived, relieving the siege of Moscow and becoming the key to victory.

From this, we know how important the commander has for the war! Both for his subordinates and for the enemy. At the same time, the commander is not the so-called "iron man," he also has fear and contradictions, it all depends on how he overcomes the weaknesses in his heart. This may be the key to victory.

If you readers want to know more details, you may as well buy a copy to read, and the fluency of the translation and the tension of the content are like a war film.

### Democracy and Design

— Chen Tao

Original by D. Lilienthal Translated and described by Xu Zhonghang Published by The Commercial Press

At a time when everyone is paying close attention to economic democracy, this is indeed a good book worth introducing.

The original author of Democracy and Design, Mr. Lilienthal, is the chairman of TVA (abbreviation for Tennessee Valley Authority). Based on his ten years of experience, he described the process of this great undertaking from the occurrence of the problem to the solution in detail, with great enthusiasm and great faithfulness. He did not hide the various obstacles that had occurred—such as the suspicion of the people, the indifference of industrialists, and the insistence of experts on their own opinions, etc. Finally, he overcame them by grasping the principles of democracy. Finally, he arrived at a new understanding, that is: "To get new jobs, new factories, and fertile farmland, it is not necessary to choose between the two extremes of left and right, it is not necessary to choose between an over-centralized and huge government and powerless policies, and it is not necessary to choose between private enterprise and socialism." The author further summed up his experience and said: "The best and perhaps the only way to do things effectively is to follow the unity of nature, to follow democratic methods, and to have people actively participate every day." This is the essence of the experimental achievements of the TVA, which implements democratic design and combines science with life, technology with the people. It is also what the author wants to clarify with concrete things in this book. "In this valley, it has been proven that some methods (which the author calls grassroots democratic methods) can be developed, thereby providing greater happiness, deeper experience, and creating opportunities for freedom in the course of technological progress."

According to the narration of all twenty chapters of the book, we can know that the success of TVA today is by no means accidental, but has its successful conditions:

First, it relies on the support of the government—the President and the Congress—absolute trust, and at the same time, TVA is absolutely responsible to the government.

Second, it relies on the full cooperation of scientists, engineers, and technicians. According to a certain plan, they have worked hard for ten years, and have been able to get rid of the constraints of bureaucratic politics and party struggles.

Third, it relies on the correctness of the goal, always seeking the interests of the people, so it can get the enthusiastic participation of the people.

What was the situation in the Tennessee River Valley ten years ago? According to the author himself, "The river has become a threat of flooding, and the land and people are suffering from the state of desolation and drought." He also said: "The Tennessee River has often been a destructive monster in the past."

Now, ten years later, it has changed to another new scene. The author said: "You can see this change everywhere you go. You can see the power lines along the road, the newly painted houses, the newly installed electric water pumps in the countryside, and the cold storage, sawmills, and grinding mills set up at the crossroads. You can also see the factories that are there today, which a few years ago were exhausted farmland and rows of thatched huts. Now you see tens of thousands of new houses on the edge of the town." He also said: "New private industries have been built here, companies that had closed down have been revived, people have more money in their hands, tax malpractices have been reduced, bank deposits have increased, and the purchasing power of the market has been strengthened."

How was this significant change achieved? It started with the construction of many reservoirs to collect the water flowing down from the mountains, which was converted into electricity through a large steel pipe to supply various factories and residents in the basin. In the season of heavy rain, the management used radio to direct the opening of the stored water in each reservoir to accommodate rainwater and avoid floods. Because of the regulation of rainwater, the soil of farmland is prevented from being washed away by water. The management also provides free憐酸fertilizers to increase soil fertility. Naturally, agricultural production has increased, and the number of livestock and poultry has also increased. The reservoirs have sluices, which turn the rapid rivers into flat river surfaces, which can facilitate shipping. Furthermore, 54% of the valley is planted with trees, totaling 14 million acres of woodland. Furthermore, the roads, houses, medical and health care, cultural education, and various facilities in the countryside are improved, and the new rural construction is successful.

The spirit of democracy is fully expressed in the entire great project, and it truly achieves the level of being owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people. Therefore, TVA is not only an economic organization, but also a political organization, which achieves the task of democratic politics in another way. But it strives to avoid getting involved in the whirlpool of partisan politics, and the people it employs are also non-partisan. Personnel working in the bureau are not allowed to participate in political activities. In this way, technical knowledge can be used exclusively to serve people's daily lives and the common goals of human improvement, and reap the harvest of the modern form of democracy and its application.

In order to understand the actual situation of TVA, I also consulted Mr. Wang Zuli, an engineer who had just returned from a survey in the United States. He had an internship in TVA for three months and specialized in the study of hydraulic engineering. According to him;

"The organization of TVA is based on the Board of Directors as the highest guidance institution. There are three directors, one appointed by the President, one appointed by the Tennessee State Government, and one appointed by the Tennessee State University. They elect one of them as the chairman, who is responsible for implementation.

Under the Board of Directors is the General Manager, who is actually in charge. Under the General Manager are three major departments, one in charge of rivers, one in charge of electricity, and one in charge of farmland. Each department has more than ten sections. There are many staff members. Even the Mapping Section alone has more than 800 people. The staff has a very stable life and a very serious research spirit.

The achievements of the management in the past ten years have completed electrical and hydraulic engineering. Now it only needs to be managed. It is now studying farmland improvement work, so there is a fertilizer plant. TVA currently has 24 dams. The electricity it generates not only supplies the residents of the Tennessee Valley, but also supplies military use during the war and is used to manufacture atomic bombs.

The management was established in 1933, just during the US unemployment panic. The purpose was to relieve unemployment and prevent floods, because the river has often been plagued by floods in the past, the land is barren, and the rainfall is also large, so the purpose of the reservoirs is to prevent floods, not to irrigate.

Although the Tennessee River Basin includes seven states, it is not as large as the Huai River Basin. The Guidance Committee of the Huai River in our country was established in the 20th year of the Republic of China, which was earlier than TVA. It is a pity that our country lacks both talents and funds, and has not been able to see success immediately."

Now, there is a lot of talk about setting up the YVA Yangtze River Valley Authority in China. I hope everyone will study the successful conditions of TVA to see if we can do it in the future. In my opinion, it is not just a matter of talents and funds. Even if we have talents and funds, we still have to ask if we have the spirit of getting rid of the whirlpool of partisan politics and working hard for the cause to the end.

### "Stratosphere" Navigation – "The Contribution of War"

— Wang Yide

Between 15,000 and 25,000 meters above sea level, the temperature remains around minus 50 degrees Celsius year-round. Because the temperature is constant, this high altitude area is called the "stratosphere."

Before World War II, stratosphere aviation was considered a risky endeavor. At that time, only a few scientists and explorers engaged in stratosphere aviation. Ordinary passengers dared not attempt it, and there were no passenger planes for stratosphere flights.

With the outbreak of the war, scientists from the participating countries vied with each other, sparing no effort to improve aircraft. The United States, in particular, had to fly aircraft above 15,000 meters due to operational necessity and to avoid enemy anti-aircraft fire. As a result, the stratosphere, once regarded as a mysterious high altitude, almost became a daily route for flying generals. The so-called stratosphere flight no longer felt novel.

However, stratosphere flight is not something that ordinary aircraft can handle. Because in the stratosphere, not only is the climate cold, but also the air pressure is low and oxygen is scarce. Ordinary aircraft can only ascend to about 6,000 meters. If they venture into the stratosphere, they will inevitably encounter perilous situations. For the pilot, lack of oxygen will cause suffocation, and low air pressure will cause capillaries to burst, leading to bleeding from the ears and nose. For the aircraft itself, the extreme cold at high altitude causes moisture to accumulate on the surface, easily condensing into ice. If the flight continues, the moisture increases and the ice becomes thicker. As a result, the aircraft descends because it cannot bear the load. Therefore, ordinary aircraft are not suitable for stratosphere flight.

Aircraft that navigate the stratosphere are called stratosphere aircraft. The B17 Flying Fortress and B29 Superfortress used by the US military during the war belong to this category. These aircraft were specially designed because ordinary aircraft cannot fly in the stratosphere. Pilots of these aircraft wear oxygen masks to prevent lack of air. The aircraft components also have special heat dissipation structures, so that the temperature inside the engine can be evenly distributed on the fuselage and wings, preventing moisture from condensing into ice. Thus, the aircraft can fly safely in the stratosphere.

Passenger stratosphere aircraft only appeared after the war. Their structure is different from wartime stratosphere aircraft, because asking passengers to wear masks during the flight is ultimately restrictive. Thus, someone newly designed aircraft with air chambers to regulate air pressure and temperature to suit the normal needs of the human body, just like on the ground. In the United States, a large number of these passenger stratosphere aircraft have been converted from bombers, called Stratocruiser, which directly translates to "Stratosphere Cruiser." The size of its fuselage can be imagined.

In the stratosphere, because the air is thin and the air pressure is low, the resistance during flight is less, so the speed can be increased. After the war, many countries opened up stratosphere routes. Our country is also ordering new aircraft from the United States. If they are delivered, we can easily travel between Chongqing and Shanghai in a few hours.

"Brothers," said the chaplain. "Today my subject is liars. How many of you have read Matthew chapter 69?" Almost every soldier in the service raised his hand, though a few hesitated.

"You are exactly the people I want to preach to," said the chaplain. "Because you know, there is no such chapter in the Bible." Translated from (CatholicReview)

### Suzhou Dialect

— Shengshen

The language of Suzhou people is really a headache. Its implications are infinitely mysterious, and it has depth and shallowness. Therefore, it often makes outsiders feel like a Shandong person eating wheat winter, unable to understand at all.

Suzhou dialect is divided into three categories: local vernacular, 'qiekou', and shortened rhyme.

Local vernacular is most suitable for women to speak, especially the general female storytellers in the book circles are more pleasant to hear, really like the song of a oriole and the murmur of a swallow, if you sing the tune at the beginning of the chapter, charming singing, gentle, it is really a special feeling to hear. As the saying goes; "I would rather scold with a Suzhou person than talk to a Ningbo person".

Shortened rhymes mostly consist of idioms of four characters per sentence, omitting the last character to form a language.

Like "City God Old Lord"; Kang San Gu "Niang"; Chicken Feather Dus"ter"; Tan Song Mao "Pang"; Wind blows Cold "Da" are very popular shortened rhymes; others include Mo Ming Qi "Tudi Tang" (Nuo: The sound of "挼" "　", and "temple" and "Tudi Tang" seem to have the same meaning.) Miao Bu Ke "Jiang You" "Jiang You" is "salt" so it is similar to the sound of the word "Yan".)

'Qiekou' is the Suzhou vernacular with the deepest meaning. Only two Suzhou people can fully answer each other in 'qiekou'. Not to mention that outsiders cannot understand, people who are not nurtured by Suzhou dialect, no matter how clever you are, I am afraid you cannot guess the meaning. 'Qiekou' was originally the local vernacular of general literati, and later it turned into the slang of the lower class. Like "Above is Huangliang, below is the sea, and in the middle there is a small threshold." (The above sentence means a woman says when she is not satisfied: "I have parents-in-law above me, children below me, and a husband in the middle").

"A big 'gui' cannot be crawled out of a small hole." (This means that a person is unwilling to spend the appropriate amount of money and cannot buy good things.

"Shang Xiang Tou" (The ordinary "Shang Xiang Tou" refers to the ghosts possessing the bodies of the female sorcerers, but "Shang Xiang Tou" in 'qiekou' means guests come to visit.)

"A sesame head can be big." (It is like preparing to do a small thing. But thinking about it, it is annoying horizontally and difficult vertically, but it makes it impossible to handle,) "dustpan facing each other, broken broom" (It means the opposite of so-called talented men and beautiful women.)

Looking at the language of Suzhou people in this way, it is indeed extremely complicated, making listeners have to rack their brains.

Anecdotes and Common Sense

### "Tattoo Gang"

— Huang Jieqing

My country already had tattoos in the Song Dynasty. The soldiers recruited at that time were all tattooed with characters on the back of their hands, dyed with pigments, which would not disappear for life, as a means of identification and to prevent desertion during battle.

In later dynasties after the Song Dynasty, serious criminals who were sent to distant garrisons were tattooed with golden characters on their faces; minor criminals were tattooed on their foreheads, called "ink punishment". During the late Qing Dynasty, all criminals, robbers, thieves, and deserters were tattooed. First-time thieves were tattooed on the right arm, and repeat offenders were tattooed on the left arm; first-time deserters were tattooed on the right face, and repeat offenders were tattooed on the left face. Each crime was tattooed in a different place.

In Japan, for more than two hundred years, criminals involved in robbery cases were tattooed before being released after serving their sentences, in order to facilitate investigation and arrest in case of recidivism. It was not until modern fingerprinting could be applied that ink punishment was abolished.

As for tattooing the whole body, chest, arms, back, with colorful patterns, it is popular among various ethnic groups around the world, which is the so-called "tattoo". Half of it is for decoration or commemoration, and half of it is a symbol of "courage." In fact, they are all just remnants of barbarism.

In 1925, the Shanghai police once ordered the arrest of the "Tattoo Gang." Because at that time, it was said that the Shanghai gangsters had secret organizations. All members had patterns tattooed on their arms and legs as identification. As a result, the city was in an uproar. Originally, most people with "tattoos" were low-level workers, so at that time, even barbers, bathhouse scrubbers, boatmen, and sailors did not dare to go out, because once arrested, they would have to spend a lot of effort explaining.

Sailors and those engaged in maritime work in various European and American countries mostly tattoo their names or symbols on their bodies, so that if something unexpected happens, relatives and friends can identify them. But there are also strange patterns and absurd words. In the past, there was an American sailor who tattooed portraits of the two great men Washington and Lincoln on his chest, and added the words "fierce face and kind heart" under his neck. Another person tattooed a pair of Indian wedding pictures on his chest. Another person tattooed a beer bottle on his left arm, a sailor molesting a woman on his right arm, and three young and beautiful Spanish girls on his chest, which can be described as a magnificent sight. In addition, there was a mischievous man who tattooed the words "What women love" below his navel and abdomen. A woman tattooed the signatures of several lovers on her arm. Another woman tattooed a "sword piercing the heart" on her left arm, with the words "In memory of dear Mr. Laurel". In addition, many women in Japanese cities have colorful patterns tattooed all over their bodies.

### The Disguise of Beggars

— Huang Jiamo

Every adult beggar, regardless of gender, must wear a tattered coat and carry a long stick before they can beg on the street. Because this tattered coat is the beggar's symbol, indicating that they are indeed too poor to be considered, thereby arousing the benefactor's compassion. But if we carefully observe that tattered coat, we cannot help but be suspicious. Because if a piece of clothing (the tattered coat is limited to the upper body clothing) is worn until it is old and broken, to the point where it can no longer be worn, it will never be broken into such a fragmented appearance. This is naturally the result of the beggars' painstaking use of artificial techniques, adding patches, and connecting them, and tying them into knots one by one. It is simply impossible to find a two-square-inch piece of intact cloth on a tattered coat. Every beggar has spent a lot of time and energy to create such a tattered coat. It is called a hundred knots, but in fact it is more than a hundred knots. And no matter how broken the surface is, there is a lining inside. Although this lining is also patched with miscellaneous colored cloth, it is generally airtight. In the cold season, several not-too-bad old clothes can also be worn inside the tattered coat. But passers-by cannot see it. When I was young, I saw an old beggar woman wearing a similar tattered coat. My mother could not bear it and gave her an old cotton-padded coat, asking her to wear it outside to keep out the cold. But the beggar woman stubbornly wore it inside the tattered coat. According to her, if good clothes are worn outside, no one will give her money anymore. Although the tattered coat is so broken that it is not a coat, it has one or two extremely strong large pockets inside to store money.

Dog Avoidance Secrets

Although wearing a tattered coat is beneficial for begging, it also attracts harassment from groups of dogs. Especially in villages and towns, every household has dogs, domestic dogs and stray dogs, constantly looking for trouble. As soon as they see a tattered coat beggar coming, then "one dog barks at the shadow, and all the dogs bark." Without dog avoidance secrets, this begging rice is also inedible. The beggar gang has various dog avoidance secrets passed down from their ancestors, and their only weapon is a long stick in their hand. But to use it smoothly, it also requires experience and training. Beggars firmly believe in the principle of "dogs that bite don't bark, and dogs that bark don't bite." So although there are many barking dogs, they are not anxious, but only focus on the two fierce dogs that do not bark. When they rush up, they will stab the long stick into the dog's mouth twice. The fierce dog will definitely be injured and run away. At this time, the dogs that were cheering on, seeing their brave vanguard defeated, will also run away in all directions.

### Idle Talk about Zou Lu

— Jifeng

Zou Lu (Haibin), a member of the Central Committee who is already sixty-five years old, recently suddenly suffered a stroke and is being treated in the Central Hospital. He is stubborn in nature and can be compared with Hu Hanmin in the history of the Party and the country. When he was young, he was capable and promising. He once ran a small newspaper called "Yi Ke Bao" with Chen Jiongming in Hong Kong, attacking the government without leaving any room. At that time, the Founding Father and Zhu Zhixin were planning activities, and Zou joined the Tongmenghui at this time, and spent time day and night with Hu Zhentang, Deng Muhan, etc., becoming close friends.

After the Republic of China, he served as an envoy and director of finance, and later transferred to the education sector, serving as the president of Guangdong Higher Normal School and National Guangdong University successively. In 1925, the first Central Executive Committee members Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, Tan Zhen, and Zou and more than ten others held a meeting in front of the Founding Father's spirit in Xishan, Beiping, and resolved to dismiss the Bolodin et al. proposal, and people regarded Zou as the Xishan Conference faction.

Zou has a considerable position in Guangdong Province. When Japan was planning to invade China in 1936, General Matsui specially visited Zou Lu in Guangzhou to discuss Sino-Japanese issues. At that time, Zou directly said: "To be honest with you, no Chinese person does not hate the Japanese. Japan has three methods to deal with China: 'rob' north of the Yellow River, 'scare' the Yangtze River basin, and 'deceive' the Pearl River basin, regardless of whether its terms use 'friendship', 'Pan-Asianism', or 'unification'. Its invasion is one." Zou spoke bluntly and did not wait for Matsui to babble, and shouted: "I simply do not believe in the Japanese, don't talk, don't talk—" and sent Matsui out of Tianmen.

Zou served as the president of Sun Yat-sen University for many years. He is good at literature and reads a lot. His works are scattered in magazines such as "Republic of China", "Construction", "Zhengyi", and "New China". His articles written before the Republic of China were all destroyed by bombs in the Consultative Bureau's residence during the restoration. Now there are books such as "Zou Lu's Collected Works", "History of the Chinese Kuomintang", "History of the Guangzhou March 29 Revolution", and "Travels to Twenty-Nine Countries".

Among the important figures in the Party and the country, besides Dai Jitao, Zou Lu is probably the only one who believes in Buddhism; at home, Zou often chants Buddhist scriptures and repents with his Buddhist wife, and has a specially built Buddhist hall that is exceptionally clean.

Zou's face is different from others. His teeth are particularly long. Physiognomists once commented that he looked like a pictograph and judged him to have a noble appearance. But later, Nuo remarried. Feeling that his long teeth were unsightly, he had them pulled out by a dentist. It is said that at that time, astrologers sighed endlessly, believing that he had destroyed his good fortune.

Let's stop here. The reporter would like to hope that Zou will recover soon!

Spring and Autumn

### The Story of the Suspension Bridge

— Zhou Gui

The world is full of miracles often born from the love between two sexes, and one can find many such examples in both Chinese and foreign history. I recall that the invention of the sewing machine was also due to an affectionate husband who, seeing his beloved wife laboriously and time-consumingly sewing clothes by hand, tried every possible means to create a sewing machine to replace handwork. What an enviable thing this is!

The suspension bridge at Dujiangyan in Guan County, near Chengdu, Sichuan, also contains a touching story. Last autumn, I personally visited the place and was told this story by Mr. Zhang, the owner of the Youth Travel Agency. Mr. Yu Youren, in his commemorative poem, referred to the suspension bridge as the "Couple Bridge," in contrast to the "Father and Son Temple" (Li Bing and his son created the Dujiangyan water conservancy project, and later generations commemorated the Li family's achievements by building the "Fu Neng Temple" east of Dujiangyan), which is considered a beautiful tale.

It is said that in the early Qing Dynasty, due to the turbulent water flow in the Dujiangyan area, no bridges were built, but there was an official ferry, and people could cross the river for free. Not far from the south bank lived a scholar named He Xiande. He set up a village school at home, teaching a few young students. Every day when the sun was about to set, because there were no taverns in the village, he would ride a mule to the riverbank, take the official ferry, cross the river to drink a cup of "Gan Jiu" (a Sichuan wine like sorghum liquor). Because he had a mule crossing the river with him and was a dignified scholar, the boatman would ask for one copper coin as a reward each time, allowing him to cross the river alone in a boat. This went on for several years until unfortunately, there was a poor harvest, and the economy of this Mr. He suffered. However, he was accustomed to crossing the river to drink and did not give up his habit because of his financial setbacks. Crossing the river was not only for drinking but also for chatting with old friends (in Sichuan dialect, "bai long men zhen," meaning chatting), which was also a social center at that time and could relieve the boredom of a day in the school. However, the travel expense of two copper coins for each round trip was quite considerable at the time. Because at that time, a person could have a feast at a tavern for only three or four copper coins. With the decrease in economic income, this kind of expenditure became even more serious for Mr. He. He thought, this is an official ferry, others don't pay, why do I have to pay? This boatman is really extorting me.

Therefore, he went to the county government to accuse the boatman. When the boatman heard that this Mr. He was accusing him of extortion, he was extremely anxious. So, he ran to a wicked lawyer for help. The wicked lawyer drafted a defense for him, saying, "Dujiangyan is an official ferry, and people crossing the river have never been charged a ferry fee. But Mr. He's situation is different. He crosses the river alone (i.e., in a boat alone) and brings a mule with him. The mule's feet are nailed with iron, and the boat planks are easily damaged when getting on and off the boat. This humble one charges one copper coin each time to repair the boat planks. As for Mr. He himself, he is free of charge like other passengers. Please, Your Honor, have mercy." When the trial began, the county official listened to the plaintiffs and defenses of both parties and felt that the boatman was not at fault. So, he ruled that Mr. He had lost the case.

How could He Xiande get over this setback in his heart? Many of his friends also felt indignant. Is it really impossible for a scholar to reason with an illiterate boatman? Knowing that a wicked lawyer was behind it, but things were like this, there was nothing to do. However, they always wanted to build a bridge at Dujiangyan so that they would not be bullied by this boatman.

The season was early winter. The north wind howled on the withering leaves, and sometimes they fell one by one in the air. Mr. He's wife was as capable and thrifty as other village women. She made all the shoes for the family herself. She often turned the long bench upside down on the ground, with the four legs facing up, and wrapped the thread for making shoe soles around it one turn after another. One day, Mr. He was sitting beside her smoking to relieve his boredom, watching his wife winding the shoe thread. Suddenly, a yellow leaf fell on these turns of thread and stopped, not falling down. He happily said to his wife, "Stop for a moment, look, this yellow leaf can stay on this thread. Suppose we use many bamboo ropes (splitting bamboo into thin threads, weaving them into ropes, the thinner ones are used for towing boats, prevalent in Hunan and Sichuan) according to this principle, build bridge piers on the sandbar, connect them from the south bank to the north bank, and pave them with horizontal wooden planks, wouldn't that be a bridge that people can walk on? The success of this bridge will surely relieve the accumulated hatred in my chest." His wife also agreed to this plan. Because funding needed to be raised, they told many classmates and friends, and everyone expressed their support and gave him a lot of help. So, they raised funds, purchased materials, hired workers, and built this "Suspension Bridge" at Dujiangyan. Mr. He and his wife, as well as their relatives and friends who sympathized with them, were very happy. And the boatman of the official ferry could only change his profession.

But the only flaw was that this scholar, who "knew everything about the world," was an outsider to bridge building and couldn't have considered everything thoroughly. This bridge only had a bridge deck and no railings on both sides, and it was half a mile long and on a river surface facing high mountains to the north. The north wind in winter was really blowing sand and rocks. The river below was also very turbulent. This swaying long suspension bridge was really dangerous!

Not many days after it was built, one morning, because the villagers were rushing to the market, the bridge was too crowded, and as a result, the bridge overturned. In such cold weather, people who fell into the river rarely survived. So, Mr. He's fate fell into a cloud of sorrow again.

After this tragedy occurred, the boatman of the official ferry went to consult with the wicked lawyer on how to maintain his ferry business. Getting instructions from the wicked lawyer, he went to the county government to accuse Mr. He of building a suspension bridge that was like child's play, causing people to die. So, Mr. He had no way to defend himself and was finally imprisoned. His other relatives and friends also disappeared, fearing that they would be implicated. And He Xiande died of illness in prison soon after being depressed and angry. The boatman resumed his official ferry.

In the eyes of bystanders, this suspension bridge case gradually faded away after Mr. He's death. But the trauma in his wife's heart was constantly aching. How could she face her husband if she didn't vent this anger? After Mr. He's death, he still had a young son dreaming sweet dreams in the cradle. One day, his widowed mother was sitting beside his cradle doing needlework. One foot was stepping on the curved wooden strip under the cradle to push it. She thought about the overturning of the suspension bridge again. She realized that the cradle swayed but the child would not fall out because there were railings on both sides. If the suspension bridge also had railings on both sides, it would not overturn. So, she went to discuss it with her husband's relatives and friends, and as a result, everyone unanimously agreed. This became the original and scientific suspension bridge, a miracle of the world. Although He Xiande died in the line of duty before completing his work, his virtuous wife completed this immortal task.

You're leaving! This is the decision you've already made. On such a cold winter night, your departure clearly increases my sadness even more.

You said, "I'm leaving, I'm sad, and it will naturally make you even sadder!"

After you said that, we silently faced each other, our expressions maintaining that same rigidity, without even the slightest casual movement, fearing that something unexpected might happen or that others might see our unease. In fact, my humble bedroom, even during the day, seems to be isolated from others, let alone at night. In such a place, no one would ever come to spy on us. But we were still stifling things in that slow way, trying our best to suppress each other's inner emotions, not letting them out to create another round of intense mingling.

You're used to being able to restrain the exposure of strong emotions at any time, sitting upright and motionless, opening your eyes wide, staring at the dim corner of the room. And me? I'm looking at you diagonally. Suddenly, I wanted to grab your hand, bow my head and cry freely for a while, because I could no longer bear this suffocating atmosphere. This is more painful than enduring any kind of tangible punishment imposed by a tyrant! At the same time, I thought of using tears as a last resort to stop you from leaving, but I didn't do it that way. Such behavior, expressed in front of you, is too pitiful and childish.

The light was dim, and the cold wind outside was howling madly, the glass windows were being blown and banging. I heard your heart pounding, you seemed to be grinding your feet, as if wanting to break free from something and jump up.

"Have a cigarette!" You took out a pack of cigarettes from your pocket.

We lit cigarettes and started smoking, white hazy smoke rings coming out of the corners of your mouth; the white smoke swirled around, blurring our faces. Thin shadows filled the room, like countless soft sighs. Covering our surroundings, the smoke relieved our silent suffering.

I thought of wine—we used to drink together late at night when you came. I got up, ran to the cabinet by the door, opened the small door, picked up the Wujiapi wine bottle, but it was empty. I threw down the bottle, walked to the window, leaned against the window and looked outside, I didn't say a word to you, you seemed to be lighting a second cigarette.

Outside, the small alley leading to the main street, that lonely street lamp, like eyes after sobbing, revealed tired pupils, with only a line of yellow shadow painted on the dark wall.

I thought: From tomorrow onwards, this alley will only have the sound of my lonely footsteps. You used to come here often, although there were always few pedestrians in this dirty alley, there were still times in the early morning or evening when we shared the sound of two pairs of feet in harmony as we went in and out. After you leave, this alley will be like a cold and terrifying hand reaching out to my side!

I continued to think, you were still sitting there silently.

We spent a long time like this in the cold night. Because you had to catch the night train, you couldn't stay any longer. I picked up the simple luggage you brought and took you out of the alley to the main street to call a pedicab. You got into the pedicab, and the piercing cold wind was blowing fiercely. Our hands, holding each other, were like two frozen dead trees, with no exchange of warmth. You were the first to let go of my hand and urged the pedicab driver to pull the pedicab away.

I watched your pedicab, waiting until it turned the corner of the main street. You didn't look back once. I slowly walked back to the alley, shrinking my body, trying to avoid the cold wind. I know that emotionally you were sad about this departure. However, you cursed this foul and decadent place, you wanted to firmly leave here and embark on another new road. I understand that your strong will will not regret it, and there is no need to regret it.

Of course, when I stepped into the cold and deserted doorway, I remembered what you had said to me: "Is such a decadent place worth missing?"

### Suspension Bridge of Guan County

— Zhou Gui

### Ferry

— Liu Xian

### Leaf

— Jiang Dun

Leaves, with veins as fine as those in a human hand, stretch towards the sky, every tree spreading its leaves to absorb the sunlight it deserves. Without the beauty of flowers, without the fullness of fruits, it quietly dedicates its strength to flowers and fruits, like countless hands working for an ideal, the leaf is the palm of the tree.

The leaf, first awakened by the spring breeze, reveals its bud to the sunlight, and in the wind and rain, it forever tells of its injustice! The leaf protects the flowers, waiting for the ripening of the fruit. When its first companion is blown down by the autumn wind, the leaf knows that winter is coming. It is aware of its fate, but it has left the fruit for the tree, and every seed contains the sunlight absorbed by the leaf!

The leaf, gracefully bids farewell to the tree, gathers on the soil beside the roots, protects the roots, lets the ice and snow rot it, and then nourishes the tree, for next year's flowers and fruits! And those new leaves that reveal themselves to spring and sunlight!

The leaf, the leaf with veins as fine as a human hand, is more diligent. More sacred! Because the leaf has never created evil!

The leaf, understands what service is, what sacrifice is, the leaf understands life better than people!

### Sin Pine Hermitage

— Xiao Tuigong

Unable to sleep due to illness at night, I composed this for my sons:

The secluded hall's ancient steps are covered in desolate moss,
The eye's focus on fragrant blossoms is entrusted to ashes of calamity;
This old frame should transform riding cranes,
These paired brows find it hard to open to others.
The rivers and mountains are shattered like an empty chessboard,
Heaven and earth are vast, yet man is confined to a wine cup;
At midnight, I feel my heart and then touch my tongue,
What wealth has this century held that is worth a backwards glance?

Returning after the disaster, offering sacrifices during Qingming, quietly composed:

Another sorrowful Qingming season,
Even wild sacrifices still hear the scent of blood from war;
Though humble scholars struggle to hold a small pig sacrifice,
May our ancestors have mercy on the orphaned remnants of the people;
Vegetable dishes set the table to remember the distant past,
Moving seats and sharing incense entrust the departed to rebirth,
Don't say that empty formalities exist for announcing the first day of the month,
We have not forgotten to carry on the pure and honest family reputation.

Sick and risen on Dingchou Cold Food Festival

A pear flower tree adorns the riverside city,
Thank you for the special affection of the east wind;
High integrity has always defied the Cold Food Festival,
How many times have we attained Qingming on a lucky day?
Years spent in sorrow are all illusory,
When old age comes, ask the shadow for the shapes of grief and joy;
Ten thousand things, for no reason, strongly seek warmth,
Supporting my sick body, I listen to the yellow warbler in the spring suburbs.

Inscription on the Song of Righteousness

A bewitching yellow mist covers the Yantai,
A loyal official's will remained unfazed even after nine deaths;
The ancient and vast darkness originally cannot be destroyed,
In the short gap between white spaces, wind and thunder arise.

Giving back is comparable to Ziyi's wine bag,
Drinking feels like the Pusu spring;
Await the victory report throughout the sea and land,
And board the hundred-斛 boat on the cool night sky.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 241

— Ye Jingfeng

Who knew that just as he had calmed down, an astonishing strange thing happened again: the light in the room flickered twice suddenly, like a person's eyes, becoming lively twice in a row.

"Signal!" He Jian turned his wrist, the watch pointing exactly to eleven fifteen.

"Got it!" He almost shouted out. It turned out that the plan specified that 03 and 011, after scouting the basement of the guards, Yuanzi must immediately send this signal, so that the four layers of arrangement inside and outside could start at the same time.

In this instant, He Jian had jumped up from the sofa, about to rush out of the door, when he suddenly felt hurried, rapid, and heavy footsteps on the floor, as if many people were running in the corridor outside. He Jian was stunned when he heard this sound. At this critical moment, he had to remain extremely calm, so he withdrew his intention to rush out, and instead lowered his body and sat back in the double sofa.

Sure enough, just as he sat down, the room door suddenly opened wide, and that polite secretary, Mr. Xiyuan, hurried in, bowing repeatedly, his expression so nervous that he couldn't speak:

"He Jian-jun... Excuse me, excuse me... The Prime Minister has ordered "Urgent Correction and Removal"! ...Yes... "Urgent Correction and Removal"! ...Saying this. He bowed repeatedly, very much like a person who, carelessly mistaking someone's eldest daughter for his own wife, went up and grabbed her arm; besides bringing out the Japanese national etiquette and repeatedly bowing to apologize, there was no other way.

"Understood!" He Jian stood up, answering as he returned a bow, his attitude as calm as if nothing had happened.

What did He Jian's "understood" refer to? This requires asking official members of the Black Dragon Society. These four pronunciations of "Urgent Correction and Removal" are neither Esperanto nor Japanese, but a phrase of black talk within the Black Dragon Society that is blacker than black. It is a kind of emergency order, and this emergency order has many meanings: for example, if a member misses his job title or violates a serious society rule, in the instant before the execution in the Ministry of Justice, these four words will be said, which means he has to "commit seppuku". Furthermore, if a member is discovered while doing something secret and is surrounded on all sides, feeling that there is no way to escape, and only suicide can protect the secret, then before this person commits suicide, he must also inflate his lungs fully and pull up the energy from the Dantian as much as possible. No matter how big or high his voice is, he must shout a loud and crazy cry, and what is shouted is also this black talk—Urgent Correction and Removal—Of course, after shouting, the trailing sound must also include a "Bancai"! That is "Mount Tiantai Forever".
