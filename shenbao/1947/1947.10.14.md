### The Northeastern National Army Gains the Initiative: Kaiyuan Relieved, Zhonggu Recaptured, and the Beining Railway Line's Shenyang-Jinzhou Section Restored to Traffic

[Our Panyang Correspondent, 13th] The Northeast Communist bandits' sixth offensive is now nearing the end of its initial phase, with the next development being the main battle of the sixth offensive. In the past 24 hours, good news has poured in from the National Army. Zhou Fucheng's troops in Xin Kaiyuan have been relieved. Yingkou has been saved, Xinmin has become secure, and after the recovery of Heishan City, near Dahushan, the Shenyang-Jinzhou section of the Beining Railway Line was restored to traffic on the 13th. Reinforcements are continuously arriving from inside the pass, and Fu Zuoyi's cavalry division has already reached its designated location. Furthermore, Han Communist Li Hongguang's detachment of over 2,000 men attacked the Nan Zamu Railway Station northeast of Fushun on the night of the 12th. After four hours of fierce fighting, they were finally repelled, and the entire eastern front is now peaceful. Also, in the battle of Heishan on the 12th, Liu Shugang, the commander of the bandit's 20th Division, was captured.

[Our Panyang Correspondent, 13th] On the 13th, the National Army launched an attack from Tieling, crossed Pingdingbao, recaptured Zhonggu, and advanced towards Kaiyuan.

[Our Changchun Correspondent, 13th] The situation in the Northeast war is becoming increasingly clear. The government and various parties believe that this so-called sixth offensive by the Communist bandits is actually their last. From the National Army's perspective, reinforcements are now being continuously deployed from inside the pass, and the situation has shifted from passive to active.

[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 13th] Chen Cheng, in his memorial week address at the headquarters, stated regarding the war situation: The situation in the Northeast war is now stable, and the National Army has gained the initiative. In the past two weeks, due to the rapid offensive of the bandits and inadequate defenses, the National Army in western Liaoning suffered slight losses. The National Army achieved brilliant victories on the outskirts of Kaiyuan and Tieling. Currently, there are only minor battles on various fronts. Chen also expressed great satisfaction with the stability of public morale.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] Zhao Jia visited Changchun and Siping yesterday to inspect the situation and met with the commanders of the garrison in Changchun, the mayor, and Liang Huasheng, the chairman of Jilin Province. He then flew back to Shenyang on the same day. According to Zhao, the National Army can soon join forces between Tieling and Kaiyuan, and the war situation has entered a stable phase.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] The situation in the southern section of the Changchun-Shenyang area is gradually moving from stability towards clarity. The National Army brigades continuing north from Shenyang, and the main force of the bandit army, which has been depleted through repeated battles, have been engaged in a full-scale battle on the border between the two Liaoning provinces for over a week. Since the 12th, after the National Army launched proactive attacks from the three strongholds of Siping, Kaiyuan, and Tieling, the great battle north of Shenyang has entered a decisive stage. If the main force of the hundreds of thousands of bandit troops does not manage to flee in the next few days, they will inevitably face a fate even more惨 than the Siping campaign in May of this year.

### Liao Yaoxiang's Interview with Reporters: The Communist Bandits' Plan Completely Destroyed

[Our Panyang Correspondent, 13th] General Liao Yaoxiang is overseeing the war on both the northern and southern fronts, traveling back and forth. On the 13th, a reporter encountered him somewhere. According to his account: Although the current war situation does not allow for excessive optimism, it has indeed become stable. The Communist bandits' sixth offensive came with great force. Their plan was to completely destroy the Beining Railway, cut off the important supply lines between inside and outside the pass, then occupy Xinmin, take Tieling, capture Yingkou, and seize Dahushan, completing the entire encirclement of Shenyang, the heart of the Northeast. Currently, the entire Northeast Field Communist bandit force has been mobilized, and it has now reached the stage where the opening battle of the "sixth offensive" is coming to an end. In the initial phase, the National Army has shattered the bandits' plan. Not only have the bandits gained little, but they have also suffered major blows in Tieling and Xinmin. They are now considering their remaining resources and are hesitating between Kaiyuan, Tieling, and other fronts. The bandit's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns attacked Kaiyuan and Tieling, the 2nd column attacked Siping, the 7th column attacked Xinmin and Dahushan, the 8th column attacked Yingkou, the 11th column attacked Fushun, and the 5th, 9th, and 10th columns were also mobilized. The use of such a large force in the initial phase of the "sixth offensive," especially the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns, which the bandits consider elite troops, has led to such an outcome that the bandits cannot help but worry about their remaining resources. Although there will be many difficulties ahead, the National Army's strength is increasing, and we will ultimately achieve final victory.

### Improving the Treatment of Public Education Personnel; Index-Based Salary Payment Is Difficult; Supervisory Committee Insists on the Original Proposal; Executive Yuan Discusses at Today's Routine Meeting

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] The Executive Yuan will submit the issue of improving the treatment of public education personnel for discussion at the routine meeting on the morning of the 14th. Although the Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Political Consultative Council advocate paying salaries based on the cost of living index, the Executive Yuan still believes that there are many difficulties. The reporter visited a certain director of the finance department today, who said: The competent authority has conducted a calculation based on the proposals submitted by the various branches. If estimated according to the current 30,000 times the original salary, the increased treatment for civil servants nationwide will increase the national treasury's monthly expenditure by 3 trillion to 4 trillion, so the national treasury is afraid that it will not be able to bear it. Moreover, based on the actual situation, the fastest cost of living index for various regions will be reported to Beijing around the 5th of next month, and after being reviewed and approved and sent back to various regions, the fastest will also be around the 25th of next month. If so, then the salary must be delayed until the next month, which is technically very difficult.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 13th, the Supervisory Yuan held a meeting of supervisory committee members. The committee members present unanimously stated that the plan to jointly adjust the treatment of public education personnel according to the cost of living index, as decided by the Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the National Political Consultative Council earlier this month, is the minimum requirement to maintain the livelihood of public education personnel. However, it has recently been reported that the Executive Yuan will still maintain the method of adjustment based on a multiplier, which they believe is unreasonable and will be discussed again with the Legislative Yuan and the National Political Consultative Council to take a consistent attitude.

[Another Dispatch] Commodity prices in various places are rising sharply, and the lives of ordinary people have become difficult, especially for public education personnel. The Capital's All-Circles National Salvation General Mobilization Committee recently telegraphed the Chairman, strictly ordering the administrative authorities to adjust the treatment of public education personnel based on the actual situation, strengthen price controls, and encourage the development of industry and commerce, so that the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation can be smoothly completed.

### Zhang Qun Reports on His Inspection Impressions at the Memorial Week

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Kuomintang Central Committee's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 13th in the auditorium of the department. After Chairman Sun Ke led the ceremony, Zhang Qun, the director of the Executive Yuan, reported on his impressions of his recent inspection of the Northeast and North China. He briefly stated that before the September 18th Incident, he had worked in the Northeast for several months, and after the September 18th Incident, he had also gone to North China from time to time. Contrasting his memories with his recent experiences, both the Northeast and North China have made progress. The areas inspected during this trip had previously been occupied by Japan, and the current environment is still harsh. The people have deep impressions of the cruelty of Japan and the Communist bandits, whether they have witnessed it or experienced it themselves. The people of the Northeast and North China hate and fear the Communist bandits. Therefore, the closer the Communist bandits' propaganda is to the bandit areas, the less effective it is, and the closer the government's mobilization efforts to suppress the rebellion are to the bandit areas, the more successful they are.

### Xu Siping Talks About Military Service, Treats People with Sincerity

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] Military News Agency Dispatch: Currently, the entire military service administration is not well understood by outsiders, that is, why conscription continues after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Xu Siping, the director of the Military Service Bureau, specifically told reporters: "Conscription is a way to build the country, build the army, and defend ourselves. It is not because of the current suppression of bandits and rebellion that conscription is necessary. In any country in the world, there must be preparations in peacetime to protect the national defense. If there is no conscription, once something happens, there will be no preparations. Therefore, the current conscription is purely based on this major premise. The current suppression of bandits is actually a necessary path for the country to move towards unification. The people have the obligation to perform military service, which is clearly stipulated in the Constitution, and the Military Service Law is formulated based on the Constitution and approved by the highest authorities, so there will be no bias and no unfairness. Moreover, those who are conscripted are given many preferential treatments, and attention is paid to the implementation of military service and improvements are made at any time. Due to the fact that the implementation of the conscription system in large cities seems to be difficult, voluntary soldiers are recruited. If there is a shortfall, 　 will still be drawn. Although there are still some difficulties in implementing the military service administration at present, we hope that the news media will provide more assistance. The Military Service Bureau will definitely treat the people with sincerity, and all difficulties can be resolved."

### Wang Chonghui Discusses Bullitt's Proposal: In Line with Truman's Policy; Currency Value Can Be Stabilized If Loan Is Successful

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] A reporter visited Dr. Wang 　 Hui, an authority on diplomacy, on the 13th to inquire about his opinions on Bullitt's proposal. He said that Bullitt has been an envoy to various countries and has a very deep understanding of the international situation. His article on the proposal to aid China is practical and pertinent. Not only does China welcome it, but all those who want to see the realization of world peace also feel deeply gratified. 　 Bullitt's article is actually in line with President Truman's policy of aiding Europe. The purpose of Bullitt's article is to call the attention of the U.S. government and people to the situation in Asia and urge their government to adopt a reasonable and effective Far East policy in order to avoid the drawbacks of 　 Ku. Wang believes that the revival of the Communist International is mainly a propaganda offensive, but this will inevitably promote the opposition between democracy and totalitarianism, and make the situation increasingly tense. As for what China should do in the increasingly dangerous international situation? Wang said that we do not have to take the country as the object. Since we have always advocated democracy, we will stand on the side of the democratic front in the future and actively strive for the realization of world peace.

President Zhang Yi said that Bullitt's view of China is extremely correct and far-sighted. If the U.S. loan to us is successful, commodity prices can be stabilized, the currency value can be fixed, and domestic order can be restored to a normal state. Zhang pointed out that in the period from the Yalta Secret Agreement to Marshall's visit to China, no one was fairer and more insightful about China than Bullitt. President Cheng Xiaogang said that Chinese people must strive for progress, self-reliance, and then, in addition to the United States, other countries will also be willing to help China. He believes that the United States 　　　　　　　　　　　　. Regardless of whether its loan is successful or not, its focus is on the United States itself. President Zhu Jingnong said: U.S. loan is extremely important to China's construction. My country's university education, equipment, and teachers are all deficient. If the U.S. loan is successful, I can order a large number of instruments from abroad, and 　 international first-class professors to China to teach, hoping that friendly countries will help us build, but not accept foreign interference in my country. Bullitt's 　　 can change the views of some Americans on me. President Li Shouyong said that the Chinese question, directly and indirectly, can affect the safety of the world, we not only hope that the United States will lend me 1.35 billion yuan, but also hope that there will be greater assistance.

### Stimulating Factors in the Wild Price Surge

Since the beginning of October, prices have been soaring continuously. Recently, the surge has become increasingly wild, with different prices in the morning and evening markets. People are truly breathless in this wild price surge. The central government is concerned about the prices in Shanghai and recently sent Liu Zhendong, Huang Yuanbin, Shi Kuiling, and others from the National Economic Commission to Shanghai for investigation. However, what welcomed Liu and his party to Shanghai was not a slight reduction in the habitual price surge, but rather a continued wild increase in prices. Liu and his party have been in Shanghai for several days, and we have not seen them issue any statements in the newspapers, presumably because they are devoted to investigation and research, and do not indulge in empty talk. This spirit is quite commendable. Frankly speaking, in the past, price increases were often stimulated by casual remarks and haphazard planning by important figures. Therefore, the silence of Liu and his party is at least not a factor in stimulating prices.

The fact that prices have been rising in the past few days is a reality that every Shanghai citizen has personally experienced. The consequences of this wild surge not only pose a serious threat to people's livelihoods and general industry and commerce, but also are sufficient to affect social order. From whatever aspect one considers, the government must make every effort to stop this wild surge. If there is no method and it is allowed to take its natural course, or if there is a method but the government is hesitant, then the government is incompetent.

The wild price surge has broken past records in the past few days. Taking rice as an example, at the beginning of this month, the price of rice in the city was still around 570,000 yuan per picul. It then gradually increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, the retail price of rice tended to rise above 800,000 yuan, an increase of about 50% within ten days! During the same period, general prices have also seen a surge, with the wild increase in the market prices of cooking oil and cloth being particularly astonishing. Within these ten days, it is not difficult for us to see some traces of the wild price surge. Tracing back this October price surge, we must start from the increase in the exchange rate of the US dollar from September 30th. The Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee increased the market price of the US dollar by 3,500 yuan that day, from 46,000 yuan to 49,500 yuan. Subsequently, we saw the market price of cooking oil soaring, rising by 100,000 yuan at the same time. The negotiated price of flour also increased by 180,000 yuan, and it was decided that the negotiated price of flour would be adjusted flexibly in the future. However, the price of rice at that time was still around 570,000 yuan. On October 4th, cotton cloth rose sharply, and the price of yarn was also adjusted, increasing by 700,000 yuan per piece for 20-count yarn. The next day, the price of yarn continued to rise wildly, increasing uniformly for both coarse and fine yarns, from over 800,000 to over 1 million yuan, while the price of rice remained unchanged. On the 6th, the price of rice finally rose by 30,000 yuan due to the increase in the price of yarn, cooking oil, and other commodities. At the same time, the forward exchange rate increased by 8%, and the yarn market became more chaotic. According to reports, the wholesale price index rose from 67.568 to 74.367 between September 29th and June 4th. On the 9th, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee increased the market price of the US dollar to 55,300 yuan, and the price of rice jumped by 100,000 yuan, from around 570,000 yuan to around 670,000 yuan. Recently, prices have become increasingly crazy, with the price of rice almost exceeding 800,000 yuan. Under such a wild surge, people's livelihoods are deteriorating, and the majority of legitimate industries and businesses are also in imminent danger, except for a few who are speculating for profit!

From the price fluctuations in the past ten days, it is not difficult to see the relationship between the exchange rate and price changes. When the exchange rate rises, prices follow; and when prices rise, it also affects the rise in the exchange rate. This is already a vicious cycle, not to mention the black market exchange rate and psychological factors involved. If the rising trend of the black market exchange rate can be curbed, then the price surge may be slightly reduced. Indeed, there was a short period in the past ten days when prices tended to fall back. Because most people thought that the rise in the black market exchange rate was just a craze, they wanted it to return to calmness, and they focused their attention on whether the market price of the exchange rate would rise. On October 8th, when the black market for foreign exchange and gold notes was already fluctuating wildly, a person in charge of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee told reporters: "The adjustment of the market price of foreign exchange will never follow the black market." However, as soon as this statement was made, the next day we saw the Equilibrium Committee increase the market price of the US dollar by 5,800 yuan, changing it to 55,300 yuan. The second day happened to be Double Ten National Day. Although there was no public market price, people were already feeling uneasy. As a result of this evolution, it finally evolved into today's wild surge.

Prices and foreign exchange rates are already mutually causal, forming a vicious cycle. Looking at the course of this wild price surge this month, we cannot but say that it has been harmed by the drastic changes in the exchange rate. The fact that the Equilibrium Committee has changed the exchange rate twice within ten days cannot but have a significant impact on the psychology of the general public. In particular, the person in charge of the committee said that the market price of foreign exchange would never follow the black market, but the exchange rate has already fluctuated. Regardless of whether the Equilibrium Committee has its own sufficient reasons, insisting that the change in the exchange rate is not following the black market, in fact, the general public will inevitably regard it as following the black market! If the method of following the black market is used to eliminate the black market for a long time, then the market price of foreign exchange is no different from a dog chasing an electric rabbit in a dog racing track! Anyone can manage foreign exchange this way, but who will be responsible for stimulating prices?

In recent years, the general public has been deeply troubled by price fluctuations, and they all hope that prices will stabilize one day. At this time, the measures of the government authorities should especially grasp the hearts of the people, and must not specialize in empty talk and high-sounding rhetoric in theory, while in practical actions, they often disappoint the general public. Most importantly, those in charge of management must make big plans and set big strategies without any consideration of personal interests, and must be extremely confidential and not leak any information in advance. Otherwise, those who are good at catching shadows will often take advantage of the opportunity for profit, and further stimulate the price increase. A few people get rich, but the vast majority of the masses suffer!

### Reactions to Bullitt's Proposal

(Continued from page 1) Since Bullitt's urgent aid to China proposal was published, reactions among foreigners in the city have varied depending on their own standpoint. Generally, they can be summarized into two types, which are discussed as follows: Some believe that Bullitt is a prominent figure in American politics, and his aid to China proposal will inevitably attract the attention of the White House and the State Department. As for whether Bullitt's proposed method of aid to China is feasible, that is another question. It is particularly surprising that the estimated amount of US dollars needed is so precise. Others believe that two points in Bullitt's proposal are difficult to realize. In terms of loans, the Marshall Plan to aid Europe has been hindered, and the funds needed to revive southern Korea have also been reduced due to opposition from Congress. Therefore, at least for the time being, China's hope of obtaining loans is not great. In terms of sending MacArthur to China as an advisor, MacArthur is indeed a talented general, but he may not be suitable for this type of political work. As for Bullitt himself, he has many friends in the diplomatic community, but his reputation in the United States is not very high. He ran for mayor of Philadelphia last year and was defeated, which can serve as proof. Therefore, the actual impact of his proposal is still difficult to predict.

### Poland's Economic System: Focusing on Developing the Sugar Industry "Travels in Poland," Letter 6 (Part 2)

— By Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

Cooperative enterprises have now become a rather important part of Poland's economic system. The Communist Party's socio-economic policies divide all enterprises into three types: state-owned, cooperative, and private. According to the "Nationalization of Enterprises" Act promulgated on January 3, 1946, privately operated factories are limited to no more than fifty workers. In other words, all factories with more than fifty workers are to be taken over by the state or operated by cooperatives. The total number of cooperatives in Poland has not been precisely counted, but the estimated number of cooperative members is approximately over three million. I did not have time to go to the city of "Lodz," which is the industrial center of Poland. According to recent population statistics, Lodz has a population of nearly one million, even greater than the capital of Warsaw. (Warsaw, before the war, once had a population of two million, but now only has 300,000.) In Lodz, the more substantial factories have been taken over by the state from private hands. The government has already paid compensation to the factory owners for many of them, and the funds for compensating certain factories will only be included in the state budget for next year or the year after. My Polish friends told me that the issue of nationalizing enterprises is now often the subject of debate in Parliament. The opposition Polish Peasants' Party of Mikolajczyk firmly advocates maintaining a system of free competition for small businesses. The International Propaganda Office originally wanted to send a special car to take me to Wroclaw to visit the largest state-owned textile factory, but I cancelled the appointment at the last minute due to some matters. The next day, they sent someone to accompany me to visit the Wittels Chocolate Factory across the Cao Sha River, which was one of the factories taken over by the government from private hands after Poland's liberation.

I am extremely impressed by the spirit of the Polish Communist Party in industrial construction. Take the Wittels Sugar Factory, for example: 1,200 employees are able to work diligently and happily. Especially the workers'

Welfare Facilities

Nurseries, employee hospitals, and entertainment venues, although not as lavish as those at the Ford factory in the United States, are clean and tidy. Everywhere you look, you can see that the person in charge has put their heart and soul into truly treating it as something important.

The director of the Wittels factory, Mr. Szulzyński, is an amiable and sincere middle-aged man. A long time ago, he graduated from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Vilnius University. Sugar production was not originally his specialty, but because he studied chemical engineering, many "thresholds" were not difficult to understand after studying them. He showed me many photos, which showed the damage to the sugar factory when Warsaw was first liberated. "Although it is said that the government took over private enterprises, this situation was almost entirely a new beginning!"

He said: All the workers in the factory are members of the Polish Workers' Food Industry Union. The workers adopt a "hourly wage system," working an average of forty-six hours per week. The hourly wage is between thirty-seven and sixty zlotys, depending on the worker's skill. Workers donate one percent of their monthly income to pay union dues. The salaries of employees are paid monthly, ranging from 15,000 zlotys to 90,000 zlotys. Employees and workers can enjoy welfare facilities such as nurseries and hospitals. In addition, there is an internal "social insurance" system within the factory to protect workers from accidents and misfortunes.

He said: Last year's production volume was 2,047 tons, including chocolate, biscuits, and sugar. Among the 1,200 workers, 750 are male and 450 are female. The most wonderful thing is: after the factory was

Nationalized

The original old Lan, who was the general manager, is now still working in the factory as a worker. Szulzyński said: "The original old Lan was a Polish capitalist. Although he did not receive higher education, he is an expert in sugar production. He has experience, so after the government took over, we still let him work in the factory."

Now, the Wittels factory is directly under the Polish Ministry of Food, because sweets are one of the necessary foods for Westerners. All factory production is directed by the Ministry of Food, and the amount of workers' wages is decided by the Ministry of Food in consultation with the union. I asked the director: Have there ever been any strike incidents in the Wittels factory? He shook his head. Up and down, I wandered around the factory for a long time and saw many machines that an "outsider" could not understand. I knew that half of those machines were made in England and half were made in Germany. The main raw material for chocolate, "cocoa," is shipped from the "Gold Coast" of Africa. The paper for wrapping sugar is supplied periodically by the Paper Industry Association.

The guild and union systems connect the entire industry, which is no different in capitalist and communist countries. Poland established the "Central Design Bureau" in October 1945, and at the beginning of this year, it announced a "Three-Year Economic Construction Plan." The content of this plan focuses on the coordination of industry and transportation, especially the connection between industries. More broadly, the

Iron Curtain Behind

Industrial connections between countries are gradually being strengthened. In the Wittels Sugar Factory, I saw them preparing to send treasures to exhibitions in Czechoslovakia and Sweden. Before bidding farewell, Director Szulzyński also told me a story. He said: U.S. Republican presidential candidate Stassen, when visiting Warsaw, also visited the Wittels Sugar Factory accompanied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The former U.S. Ambassador to Poland, Bliss Lane, was also present. Stassen, in order to see the actual lives of the workers, specifically dined with the workers in the large restaurant. "Of course, the workers in our poor country only eat coarse food and simple meals, but that Mr. Stassen was eating with relish. But it was Ambassador Bliss Lane who suffered, sitting on pins and needles, unable to eat. Stassen repeatedly said to the Ambassador silently: 'Eat, such a delicious lunch!'"

The Polish people still resent that former U.S. Ambassador, and some Polish intellectuals say that he was the most diplomatically ignorant diplomat in international friendship, and some even scold him as the biggest enemy of Poland. A reporter from a Polish left-wing newspaper told me: "Bliss Lane has recently been writing articles in American magazines, scolding Poland!" I saw that he was very angry when he spoke. I said: It's a pity that I didn't see that magazine, I would really like to see how he scolds. (Continued from yesterday's third page)

### European Countries Request for Aid Amounts: US Insists on Reductions: Advocates Reopening the Sixteen-Nation Conference to Revise the Report: European Aid Plan Enters Political Phase

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Authoritative sources say: When the U.S. government begins meetings with European Sixteen Nations Economic Cooperation Committee Chairman Franks and other members, it will investigate the possibility of reopening the Sixteen Nations Conference so that, before submitting the U.S. government's aid plan to Congress, the European countries can agree to inevitable revisions of the original Paris Conference report. European diplomatic circles here do not feel enthusiastically about this suggestion, but authoritative U.S. sources say: If European countries are unwilling to reconvene the conference, then the U.S. government can only: 1. submit the original report of the Paris Conference together with the U.S. government's criticisms and recommendations to Congress; or 2. only agree on revision methods with the delegation led by Franks without submitting it to the sixteen countries for a unified vote, which will inevitably cause criticism from individual countries within the sixteen.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th, United Press] The Marshall Plan will enter the political stage here on the 13th. Based on current indications, U.S. officials believe that the report of the sixteen-nation Paris Conference needs to be extensively revised. After U.S. officials met with European technical experts last week, U.S. officials believe that the plan overemphasizes certain sectors. They believe that the report, which calculates the four-year needs of Europe based on the technology of production capacity, is unrealistic and overestimates the needs of the United States. Several members of Congress who have just returned from Europe believe that the Marshall Plan must be implemented. Some of these members of Congress may hold meetings with political problem experts this week to discuss revising figures and changing timelines. U.S. officials are scheduled to meet with European experts again on the 13th. Participants will include European Economic Cooperation Committee Chairman Franks, Acting Secretary of State Lovett, and other senior U.S. diplomats.

[Reuters, London, 12th] The Payment Agreement Committee of the Paris Sixteen Nations Conference on Finance convened in London on September 22 to study the European currency automatic exchange system proposed by the Finance Committee. Its report was published today. The purpose of this system is to promote the development of trade between European countries, so as to exchange a greater quantity of materials than under the current national currency exchange system. Under the automatic exchange system, a country that holds trade-generated deposits in another country can use them to settle trade debts with a third country. This clearing system can minimize payments in gold or convertible currencies.

### Western Europe Should Urgently Help Themselves and Not Solely Rely on U.S. Dollars: U.S. Congressional Delegation to Europe Issues Statement

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 12th] The former U.S. House Special Committee, formed to investigate the needs of various countries for U.S. aid, conducted a six-week investigation in eighteen European countries. Today, the committee's vice chairman, Hand, issued a statement, stating in brief: Our task was already difficult, but it is now made even more difficult by two common misconceptions in Europe: first, that the United States must continue to export in large quantities to prevent economic collapse; second, that Marshall's proposal in fact imposes a responsibility on the United States. Furthermore, the general public, unlike responsible government officials, does not seem to understand that the food and fuel available for export from the United States are limited in number. These misconceptions create an unfounded optimism, sometimes even using it to comfort oneself about the real difficulties at hand. After returning home, we deeply feel that the governments and people of Western European countries must deal with many difficulties, some of which cannot be solved by U.S. dollars alone.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The special committee of Congress studying the European aid plan returned from its investigation in Europe last weekend. It is learned that the committee will submit a proposal to Congress for a certain degree of aid to Europe, but the amount will not be as large as U.S. officials have requested. The representatives were unable to agree on the urgency and amount of aid to Europe. United Press reporters interviewed four of the six representatives. They believe that France and Italy, under the current situation, can at least maintain until next spring. Another representative said that the two countries should receive aid as quickly as possible. Another representative did not express an opinion on this matter.

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to U.S. diplomatic officials, the French economic crisis may reach a breaking point within this week. U.S. aid will either be too late or a drop in the bucket. U.S. authorities continued to study at the end of the week whether to provide enough U.S. dollars to France to tide over the difficulties and prevent the country from completely stopping its purchases of wheat fat and coal from the United States before the local elections. However, the hope of this happening is extremely slim. At most, we can only try to maintain a very small number of materials continuing to be imported into France.

### British Deputy Prime Minister Encourages Citizens to Increase Production

[Reuters, London, 12th] Deputy Prime Minister Morrison gave a speech tonight, declaring that unless the British people address the export situation in every way and make full use of their spare time to increase production, the United Kingdom will inevitably be defeated in the export battle. Morrison pointed out that the post-war market is different from the pre-war situation. In many ways, the export situation is very unfavorable to Britain, so Britain must maintain the best quality of British goods, otherwise many of the pleasures in the lives of the British people will be eliminated.

### U.S. Senator Proposes Aiding Europe with Scrapped Ships: Says it Can Save 10 Billion U.S. Dollars

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Republican Senator Brewster told reporters that he will urge Congress to allocate 20 million tons of wartime-built U.S. ships, now abandoned in various ports, to European countries. He said that this could save the Marshall Plan 10 billion U.S. dollars.

### Briga and Tenda Incorporated into French Territory

[Associated Press, Tenda, Italy, 12th] Residents of the Briga and Tenda districts on the French-Italian border held a referendum today. Representatives from Switzerland, Sweden, and the Netherlands were assigned by the International Court of Justice to serve as observers. As a result, the vast majority voted to become part of France. The Italian peace treaty originally stipulated that the two regions should be incorporated into France, but the French constitution prohibits acquiring territory without the consent of the local residents. Both regions have hydroelectric power plants, making them particularly valuable.

### Batavia Consular Corps Passes Final Report Content: Indonesia Plans to Send Goodwill Mission to China

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 13th] At the meeting of the Consular Committee today, chaired by our Consul General Jiang Jiadong, the content of the committee's final report was passed. The report includes not only the ceasefire order but also the general situation. The report will be signed by the Consuls General of China, the United States, Britain, Belgium, Australia, and France, and will be conveniently brought to Singapore on the way back to the country by our military aircraft on the 15th, and then transferred to the UN Security Council by British aircraft.

[United Press, Batavia, 13th] The Republic of Indonesia plans to send a goodwill mission to China. Following the visit of Special Envoy Li Tiezheng to Indonesia at the beginning of this year, the Republic planned to send a mission to China.

### Soviet Union Suggests Withdrawing Troops from Korea Next Spring: U.S. Government Decides to Reject: Marshall to Send Reply to Soviet Foreign Minister

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] A spokesman for the U.S. delegation announced today that Secretary of State Marshall will reply to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, stating that the United States has submitted the Korean issue to the UN General Assembly for discussion, and the issue of troop withdrawal will also be proposed and decided upon in the General Assembly. This response is tantamount to rejecting Molotov's suggestion that the U.S. and Soviet troops in Korea withdraw simultaneously next spring.

The Soviet Union has issued two notes to the United States, expressing dissatisfaction that the United States has failed to respond to the previous Soviet proposal for troop withdrawal and pointing out that this hinders the resolution of the issue. Marshall has decided to reply with the above opinions. The spokesman for the U.S. delegation also said that the United States may submit a proposal on the troop withdrawal issue to the General Assembly around Friday this week. The content of the proposal will advocate that the withdrawal date be jointly agreed upon by Korea and the United States and the Soviet Union, with the consent of a UN organization. In addition, it will also advocate: 1. Electing a Korean National Assembly. During the election, a UN organization will send an observer team to monitor whether the voting in the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones of Korea is democratic. 2. This National Assembly will elect a provisional unified government and may ask the UN observer team for assistance. This proposal will be presented to the 57-nation Political Committee of the General Assembly by U.S. Representative Dulles and discussed in early next week. Once passed, it will be submitted to the General Assembly for final discussion.

### South Korea Organizes Political Affairs Conference

### Peace Conference with Japan: Rumored to be Convened in January Next Year: U.S. State Department Refuses to Comment

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Renowned U.S. radio commentator Pearson, known for his fast-paced reporting of inside news, announced in his weekly broadcast on the evening of the 12th that the long-awaited peace treaty with Japan will be held in Pearl Harbor in January next year. Marshal MacArthur has been internally designated as the chief representative of the United States. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt met with President Truman last week to discuss the time and place for convening the peace conference. Pearson did not reveal more details. The State Department refused to comment on this matter.

### Syrian Military Action: Britain Issues Warning: Egypt Denies Troop Movements

[United Press, Damascus, 13th] The British Chargé d'Affaires in Syria submitted a note to the Syrian government, stating that the speech made by British Colonial Secretary Jones regarding Britain's withdrawal from Palestine was conditional. At the same time, Britain continues to be responsible for maintaining peace and order. Any action taken by Syria that harms the residents of Babbu will be regarded as detrimental to the British government. After receiving the note, the Syrian government immediately convened a meeting to consider it.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 13th] Rumors that Syrian troops have concentrated on the northern border of Palestine, and even tended to send troops to attack the Jewish areas of the Galilee district, have been denied by authoritative sources here.

[United Press, Cairo, 13th] Egyptian Chief of Staff Antella denied on the 13th that any Egyptian troops had moved to the border of Palestine. He also denied the news that he would go to Damascus to discuss military actions to attack Palestine with other Arab leaders.

### Foreign Consulates in Holy City: Bombed

[United Press, Jerusalem, 13th] An explosion suddenly occurred in front of the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem on the 13th. The bomb exploded ten feet from the entrance. Because it was homemade, it was not very powerful, and only a local female employee was injured. Police cars rushed to nearby consulates to prevent further incidents. Before the U.S. Consulate was bombed, the British and Swedish consulates had also been bombed.

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 12th] The Polish Consulate here was bombed last night, and the iron gate was damaged, but there were no deaths or injuries. This is the second time that foreign consulates in the city have been attacked recently.

### Jewish Terrorists: Plan to Assassinate British Foreign Secretary

[Reuters, London, 13th] The London Evening Standard reported that Scotland Yard has uncovered a plot to assassinate British Foreign Secretary Bevin. Scotland Yard detectives learned that terrorists (probably Jewish terrorists) had planned to assassinate Bevin. The security protecting Bevin has been notified that the terrorists will definitely attempt to assassinate him. This report could not be confirmed at this time. When reporters asked Bevin about this, Bevin declined to comment, and Scotland Yard also remained silent.

### The United States Opposes Any Nation Seizing Iranian Oilfields by Force; Iran's Foreign Policy Hesitates at a Crossroads

[United Press International, Tehran, 13th Dispatch] Iranian Deputy Prime Minister Khaganu recently announced that Prime Minister Sultana will submit a report on oil negotiations with the Soviet Union to the parliament next week. He stated that during Sultana's tenure, the United States did not negotiate with Iran, nor does it desire Iran's oilfields. The United States will not object to Iran granting oil concessions to any foreign country, but he believes the United States will oppose any attempt to seize Iranian oil lands by military force or coercion.

[Reuters, Tehran, 12th Dispatch] Observers believe that the establishment of the new Comintern by nine European countries has caused Iran's policies, especially regarding the formation of the Soviet-Iranian Oil Company, to become hesitant.

The Iranian parliament has not yet approved the Soviet-Iranian agreement stipulating the establishment of this oil company, and although Prime Minister Sultana has promised to submit a detailed report on this matter to the parliament, various parties still doubt whether the agreement, signed during the Soviet military's presence in Iran, is binding on Iran. The semi-official Ettela'at newspaper advocates for cautious action, while supporters of the Iranian Prime Minister have unanimously criticized the recent actions of the Communist Party.

### The Imminent War Crisis Prompts the United States to Heighten Vigilance

[United Press International, New Orleans, 13th Dispatch] Senator McMahon, a prominent member of the Joint Atomic Energy Committee of both houses of Congress, stated in a speech here: "The United States will decide next year 'the shape of the world for the next two centuries.' The United States may save Western Europe and Asia, placing them on the mat of freedom, but in the third and final world war, it will lose everything unless it can preemptively control the weapons of mass destruction." McMahon advocated for the implementation of laws prohibiting the export of certain key atomic production machinery and that the United States should consider adopting economic blockades to resist the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain.

[United Press International, Hollywood, 13th Dispatch] Vyshinsky, denouncing as war-mongers, American journalist Winchell broadcasted on the 13th, stating: "I wish to awaken America to the dangers abroad." Under Moscow's leadership, the nine-nation Communist Party organization launched a fifth column war against the United States last week. "Communist military spies are mixed among us, waiting for the opportunity to strike. You do not want to enter another war, but the next atomic war is approaching you. All resources in the communist bloc are being used for war. A well-trained Soviet fifth column will seize the governments of European countries. Italy will fall into their hands, keeping the U.S. Navy away from the Soviet Union. France will also fall into their hands, allowing the Soviet Union to attack Britain. If the United States fails to convene a special Congress, it would be a 'grave mistake, endangering the interests of the entire nation.'"

[United Press International, New York, 12th Dispatch] Senator Pepper, speaking at a Slavic American Congress banquet, proposed a world peace plan calling for universal disarmament, with the United States donating $50 billion for world reconstruction. He stated that the world has passed the crossroads of conflict and peace and is heading straight towards universal destruction. Pepper elaborated on his peace plan, stating that his world reconstruction plan should be handled by the United Nations. If all countries agree to immediately disarm to half their strength, the United States could allocate $10 billion annually for world construction over five years. Except for Germany and Japan, all countries should withdraw their occupying forces from various locations, strictly prohibiting any powerful country from interfering in the economy or politics of other countries. All colonies and mandated territories should be placed under the Trusteeship Council, allowing all nations to freely establish their governments without any foreign interference. He stated: "This plan will certainly not bankrupt the United States, as the current U.S. military expenditure reaches $10 billion annually, and the annual aid to foreign countries amounts to $4 billion."

[United Press International, Washington, 12th Dispatch] American Legion President Patterson today called on President Truman and Marshal Stalin to meet as soon as possible to resolve the five major points of international disputes. He stated that the Marshall Plan is an important step in preventing war, but this plan alone is not enough. Therefore, a Truman-Stalin meeting is the only way to resolve the following issues:  Withdrawal of occupying forces by major powers from all locations except Germany and Japan;  U.S.-Soviet agreement on international control of atomic energy;  U.S.-Soviet commercial treaty;  Agreement not to bypass the United Nations, especially regarding arms control;  Establishment of a broad and effective arms control system by the UN General Assembly.

### UN Continues Debate on the Greek Issue; Soviet Union Attacks the US Again; Stance on the Holy Land Issue to be Clarified

[Our Newspaper] New York, 13th Broadcast: Lake Success Report. The UN Political Committee today resumed debate on the Greek issue. Soviet representative Vyshinsky was the first to speak, attributing the cause of the unrest in the Balkans to the Greek government. Vyshinsky argued that countries should handle the Greek issue objectively and continued to attack the US's attitude towards the issue.

[United Press, Lake Success, 13th Dispatch] The UN Palestine Special Committee is scheduled to reconvene this afternoon. The seven Arab League countries have completed their final preparations and unanimously oppose any plan to partition the Holy Land. Each delegation plans to deliver successive speeches criticizing the US's position.

According to an Arab spokesperson, anti-American sentiment among most politicians in the Middle East has reached its peak. Meanwhile, the committee secretary announced that applications to speak have now increased to 25 countries. Apart from the Soviet Union's long-awaited statement clarifying its attitude towards the case, France, among the five major powers, will speak last and is expected to support the partition plan at least in principle. The British representative, Colonial Secretary Jones, will respond to the criticisms of the Arab representatives, but will not announce any new policies.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 12th Dispatch] Sources close to the Soviet Union say that the Soviet Union considers the partition of Palestine to be the second-best way to resolve the Holy Land dispute. The Soviet Union will give it conditional support and is expected to tell the UN General Assembly that it secretly supports a single Palestinian federation rather than two divided Arab and Jewish states. However, the source also said that the Soviet Union is prepared to offer conditional support for the approach taken by the United States.

Paul said: "Although Japan has adopted Western democratic forms, there have been no significant changes in the distribution of its economic power, social structure, or political or religious ideas." He said: "This is the result of a long suppression of democratic institutions. They still cannot 'establish the necessary leadership and organization to threaten the position of the old ruling class.'" He issued a warning, fearing the revival of Japanese militarism and that it may rise again in the future to commit aggression. Paul said: "We must ensure that Japan never wants to wage war again, which means that Japan must undergo fundamental policy changes internally in its social, economic, and political systems."

### Deadline for Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Confiscation Upon Discovery of Overdue Items; Municipal Government Resolves to Take Emergency Measures

### It is Estimated that Non-Industry Individuals are Hoarding Approximately 20,000 to 30,000 Pieces of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

(Our Newspaper) The cotton yarn and cloth market fell into a state of chaos yesterday. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan made a special long-distance call from Nanjing yesterday morning to Mayor Wu, urging him to quickly devise effective measures. Mayor Wu immediately convened a meeting at 4:00 PM with Liu Siying, acting chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, Wang Qizi, chairman of the six district cotton textile industry associations, and Shu Yuzhang, general manager of the Textile Construction Company, to discuss solutions. After the meeting, Mayor Wu met with reporters and stated that the soaring prices of cotton yarn and cloth were due to speculative hoarding and manipulation. Unless severe punishment is imposed, the prices cannot be suppressed, and other commodity prices will be affected. Since August of this year, the prices of cotton yarn and cloth have increased more than other commodity prices. It has now been decided to implement emergency measures: The Textile Adjustment Committee shall instruct cotton yarn and cloth firms, reprocessing firms, cotton cloth firms, and thread-piling firms to register their existing stocks of cotton yarn and cloth with their respective trade associations within four days (14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th) for the Textile Adjustment Committee to record. Cotton yarn and cloth that are not registered after the deadline will be deemed as hoarded and will be confiscated.  Starting from the 14th (today), the Textile Adjustment Committee will send additional personnel to conduct audits jointly with the Economic Police. They will first investigate accounts of cotton yarn and cloth purchases since July 1st, and then investigate the uses of the purchases. If hoarding exceeding the prescribed period of one and a half months is discovered, the items will be purchased at the original price. If any instances of "passing the buck" are discovered, the individuals will be subject to confiscation or other penalties under the Regulations for the Suppression of Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities.  For those who refuse to submit account books or refuse audits, the managers and supervisors of the firms will be detained for seven days in accordance with the Police Law, without imposing fines. If the account books are still not submitted within seven days, the detention will continue.  Encouraging confidential reporting and awarding rewards according to the method recently approved by the Economic Supervisory Committee's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Group.  As cotton yarn is subject to allocated prices, the Textile Adjustment Committee will also set a reasonable price for reprocessing. Strict measures will also be taken if the price of cotton cloth exceeds this prescribed price. Other audit measures will be implemented for cotton cloth in the same manner as for cotton yarn. Mayor Wu estimates that non-industry individuals are currently hoarding approximately 20,000 to 30,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth.

### Investigation Reveals Speculation and Hoarding as the Root Cause of Rising Prices in Various Markets; Xu Youzuo Provides a Report with Countermeasures

(Our Newspaper) After Police Bureau Economic Section Chief Xu Youzuo inspected the conditions of various markets with Textile Adjustment Committee Inspector Tan Yili, he drafted a report and countermeasures, which were submitted to the Municipal Government last night. The contents are divided into five categories: (A)

Cotton Cloth

Yesterday, various groups in the cotton cloth market were very active, and speculators were heard to be active, engaging in much whispered secret trading. The prices of Longtou fine cloth, Sijunzi cloth, and various other types of cloth were rising madly, due to the soaring price of raw cotton. Factories were restricting sales due to rising costs of dyes and materials. Non-industry merchants continued to absorb supply, and the association's sudden abolition of the transaction form yesterday further disrupted the market, which actually fueled the fire. Countermeasures:  Order the trade association to strictly enforce the transaction form system. If the information reported is found to be false, the Textile Adjustment Committee can purchase the goods at the declared price.  Suppress the prices of cotton, cotton yarn, and dyes to reduce costs.  Eliminate the broker system to prevent exploitation.  The Textile Adjustment Committee should strictly order China Textile to supply cotton cloth to the market to balance supply and demand.  Since there are currently no price limits or negotiated prices for cotton cloth, how can cloth prices not rise? The regulatory authorities should quickly devise effective suppression measures so that the police bureau can enforce them. (B)

Cotton Yarn

The cotton yarn market appeared relatively calm yesterday due to a slightly later opening, but merchants were still whispering and trading privately. The price of 20-count yarn rose by more than 2 million again. Trade association officials repeatedly cited imbalances in supply and demand as an excuse, but the main reasons were still the mutual purchasing by industry and non-industry merchants, withholding goods from sale, and speculators stirring up trouble, creating a sense of panic. Countermeasures: Eliminate the psychological factors of panic in the cotton yarn market. The Textile Adjustment Committee should supply the market as much as possible so that those holding goods are willing to sell, and hoarders will no longer compete to purchase.  Strictly enforce the transaction form system.  Eliminate brokers and directly allocate sales to producers to reduce the price exploitation by middlemen and reduce production costs. (C)

Rayon

Yesterday, the price of each piece suddenly rose by more than 10 million, setting a new record for price increases. It has been found that although rayon is allocated and sold by the Central Trust Bureau, it has been repeatedly transferred into the hands of speculators, who treat it as a "passing the buck" transaction. Countermeasures: The Central Trust Bureau bears the heavy responsibility of regulating rayon and should supply the market as much as possible to balance supply and demand.  Directly allocate sales to manufacturers. Strictly prevent the allocated rayon from flowing into the black market.  The trade association should strictly enforce the rayon transaction form system to facilitate investigation. (D)

Rice

The price of rice was 585,000 last week and has already exceeded 800,000 yesterday. The Rice Market is now regularly monitored by personnel dispatched by the Social Affairs Bureau Grain Administration Section. Countermeasures: Since the City has increased the allocation of rice by 100,000 dan, the allocation committee should be ordered to take the timing into account and quickly allocate sales, especially to the lower-middle class.  The smuggling of rice by factories and schools should also be investigated and prohibited.  Rice stores should sell rice at the prescribed standard price.  Stabilize public morale. Rice stores that refuse to sell rice should be sealed up, and the allocation committee should sell the rice at a fair price.  (E)

Gold and Currency

The black market remains rampant. Countermeasures:  In addition to confiscation, criminal liability should be imposed for buying gold and foreign currency.  Encourage confidential reporting, with no limit to the amount of the reward. A method for dealing with privately held gold should be established quickly to prevent it from flowing into the black market.  Except for the Central Bank, other public commercial institutions should not accept U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies at discounted rates.

Chief Fang and Others Invited to Give Moral Speeches to New Recruits

(Our Newspaper) Starting yesterday, the Shanghai Garrison Command, led by Commander Chen of the Group Regiment, invited Chief Fang, Chairman Pan, Director Zhang, and others to give moral speeches at the new recruit camps, in order to enhance the new recruits' intelligence and strengthen their confidence in serving.

### Special Commissioners from the National Economic Commission Come to Shanghai to Investigate Price Fluctuations; Collect Relevant Data to Provide to the Government for Reference

(Our Newspaper) In order to investigate the recent economic and financial fluctuations in the Shanghai market, the National Economic Commission has dispatched special commissioners Huang Yuanbin, Liu Zhendong, and Shi Kuiling to Shanghai for on-site inspections and investigations. Mr. Huang and his party arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and have established close contact with the heads of relevant agencies such as the Municipal Government, the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Central Bank, collecting the necessary information. According to Mr. Liu, their mission is to conduct on-site investigations of economic and financial fluctuations, collect relevant information, and listen to reports from various related parties in order to compile a report for the government to use as a reference for suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing the economy and finance. He also stated: "The government will definitely have a way to deal with the current economic fluctuations after we submit our investigation report. Economic fluctuations will be dealt with by economic means, and I believe that the methods will be benevolent." He finally told reporters that he would rush back to the capital tomorrow to attend the National Economic Commission's committee meeting on the 16th, at which time he would report the collected data to the meeting.

### Suspected of Concealing Traitorous Assets: Manager of Tianfaxiang Indicted

(Our Report) Tianfaxiang Leather Goods Store was originally located on Henan Road, and Shao Shi-jun, a traitor, was one of its major shareholders. After the victory, the store failed in business. This spring, the manager Jiang Zhigang sold the building to the Bank of China, with the price being fifty gold bars (i.e., five hundred taels). The Bank of China paid fourteen gold bars in advance, with thirty-six bars remaining. However, in February, the government announced an order prohibiting the circulation of gold and banknotes, so the price was converted to 5.4 million legal tender per bar and distributed according to the share amount. Shao's share was thirty gold taels, worth over 20 million legal tender. However, Jiang failed to report this to the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office, suspected of concealing traitorous assets. After being reported, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, the High Court held a hearing. According to Jiang, the funds for Shao's share have all been handed over to the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office. The court stated that further investigation was needed, and he was released on the original bail for a future hearing.

### Lonely Childhood, Tragic End: Career Failure and Hundreds of Millions in Debt, Yue Opera Star Xiao Dangui Commits Suicide

(Our Report) Xiao Dangui (see photo), one of the five great leading actresses of the old-school Yue Opera, whose real name was Qian Chunfeng, aged 27, suddenly ingested a large amount of Lysol behind people's backs yesterday afternoon and died at 6:15 PM.

Before taking the poison, Xiao Dangui was alone in her residence around 5 PM. A neighbor, Wei Meiying, invited her to Wei's house for refreshments, but Xiao Dangui politely declined, falsely claiming that she was feeling unwell, and pretended to nap in Wei's bedroom. She repeatedly urged Wei Meiying to go out for a hair wash. Wei then went out and returned in about thirty minutes. By then, Xiao Dangui had left Wei's house and returned to her residence. Wei went to look for her and smelled a strong Lysol odor in her room. At the same time, she found that she had taken poison. A Lysol bottle left on the dresser was empty. She immediately called her husband, Zhang Chunfan, and her sister, Qian Qiong, to rush her to the Sino-American Hospital for rescue, but the poisoning was too deep, and she died at 6:15 PM. Xiao Dangui was wearing a plaid spun silk short shirt and pants, a purple silk lined robe, a green velvet jacket, nylon stockings, and white satin shoes when she died. As for the reason for the suicide, it is said to be due to financial problems and temporary financial difficulties. Since Xiao Dangui started operating the Guotai Grand Theater last year, performing Yue Opera, business has been slow, with debts amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan. At the same time, she was greatly stimulated by the fact that she had bought a house in Hangzhou, which was occupied by others and could not be used by herself, leading to this tragic suicide. It is reported that Xiao Dangui came from a poor background and joined the Shengxian County Gaosheng Stage at the age of thirteen to learn opera. At that time, both her parents had passed away, and she was lonely and helpless, spending her childhood under the strict supervision of the municipal government. Eight years ago, Xiao Dangui came to Shanghai and became famous performing at the "Zhedong Theater" and the "Empire Theater."

### Four New Regulations for Advance Booking of Jinghu Railway Tickets: No More Than Three Tickets Two Days Before Departure

(Our Report) Since the Shanghai Passenger Transportation Office of the Jinghu Railway Bureau launched services such as "advance ticket booking" and "special delivery of tickets," the results have been quite good. However, the general public is often unclear about the methods and procedures for advance ticket booking. There are often people who write or call to book tickets ten days before departure, or even book ten or twenty tickets at a time, which is inconsistent with the bureau's original method of "booking tickets three days in advance, no more than three tickets per household." As a result, there are dozens of inquiries by letter or telephone every day, which greatly affects work efficiency. The bureau has recently revised four new regulations, stipulating:

From the date of this announcement, whether booking tickets in person or by phone, it will be changed to two days before the departure date (for example, on the 15th, you can book tickets for departure on the 17th). If you book tickets between 5:30 PM and 11:00 PM, it can be counted as the next day (i.e., between 5:30 PM and 11:00 PM on the 15th, you can book tickets for departure on the 18th). The limit per household is no more than three tickets. Ticket booking by mail shall be handled in accordance with the above two regulations, and the time of receipt of the letter by the office shall prevail. If the date is too early or the number of tickets booked exceeds the limit, it will not be processed, nor will there be a separate reply. Passengers booking tickets by mail must indicate the postal district code (5) or (23) for swift delivery. The address of the office is No. 1451 North Sichuan Road, Shanghai (5), phone: 44146, 44149, or (02) 61068, 60689. The address of the branch office is No. 128 Yuyuan Road, Shanghai (23), phone: 60121, 60122.

### Investigation of the China National Aviation Corporation Flight 121 Crash Concluded; Chen De and Others Not Prosecuted

### Speaking of the Shandong War Situation, Talk about the Central Plains War Situation

[Our Newspaper Jinan 8th Dispatch] The Communist bandits originally had three major base areas in the country: one was Shaanxi North, the second was Shandong, and the third was the Northeast. Now, following Shaanxi North, all areas south of the Yellow River in Shandong, except for the three counties of Wendeng, Rongcheng, and Haiyang in Jiaodong, are under the control of the National Army. The destruction of the Shandong base area, which the Communist bandits had painstakingly managed for over a decade and was regarded as the party, government, and military center "south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River," is something that anyone with a slight understanding of the Communist bandits' internal situation fully knows has caused them great pain and had a profound impact. There is no doubt that the gains and losses on the Shandong battlefield have a decisive effect on the overall war situation in the country.

In order to counter the National Army's suppression, the Communist bandits' operational guidance and tactical thinking have undergone three major transformations, or can be said to be three major stages, on the Shandong battlefield and even expanded for use on the national battlefield.

The First Stage

Was before the Battle of Laiwu on February 23 of this year. During this period, the Communist bandits' strategy was "guerilla warfare as the main method, supplemented by mobile warfare." The strategic thinking of Mao, Zhu, Liu (Bocheng), and Chen (Yi) was "evade if the enemy is superior, annihilate if the enemy is inferior." Therefore, the operational guiding principle they adhered to was "avoid decisive battles," which was exactly the opposite of the National Army's "seeking decisive battles." Therefore, even if we only discuss the Shandong battlefield, this period was actually "fighting without engaging," and naturally there was no talk of "decisive battles."

The Second Stage

Took mobile warfare as the main method, supplemented by guerilla warfare. In terms of time, it was from the Battle of Laiwu at the end of January of this year to the Battle of Linqu at the end of July. Because the Communist bandits gained some advantages in the battles of Menglianggu (northeast of Mengyin) and Tai'an after the Battle of Laiwu, they believed that as long as they concentrated their large forces, formed a local advantage, and launched突擊s on a certain point or several points of the National Army, they could definitely achieve the same results as Laiwu or Menglianggu. Therefore, during this period, the operational rule grasped by the bandits was "strike the main force, disperse the main force, freeze the main force, consume the main force." What was seen in concrete actions was when the National Army advanced in parallel from west to east from Laiwu, Xin'tai, and Mengyin in late June, directly attacking the key points of the Communist bandits' Yimeng Mountain area such as Ma'an, Yue Village, and Donglidian. Chen Yi not only did not try to rescue them, but instead used his main force to cooperate with the part of Liu Bocheng's force that had withdrawn from northern Henan to northwestern Shandong and crossed the Yellow River on the 29th of the previous month to besiege Jinan, Tengxian, Yangshanj集 (north of Jixiang), Zou County, Yanzhou, Sishui and other places in southwestern Shandong, attempting to actively occupy these places, consume the National Army, and passively obstruct and contain the advancing National Army to the east. However, no one can have everything their way. What the Communist bandits encountered in the above-mentioned places was a series of hard nails. Not only did their plans fail, but they turned from "avoiding battle" to delivering themselves to be beaten. As a result, although Liu Bandit's losses in the twenty-odd battles were only over 30,000 people, Chen Bandit's losses were at least over 70,000 people. Therefore, Chen Yi could not help but be somewhat

Flustered

After the "besieging Wei to rescue Zhao" plan failed, he had no choice but to retreat north again with his remaining main force, starting on July 19th, attacking Nanma, attempting to rescue his old nest in the mountainous area. But to make matters worse, he ran into the most elite old troops of Chen Cheng, Hu Lian's troops. Thus, after three days of fierce fighting, Chen Yi lost more than 30,000 people. Seeing that the attack on Nanma was unsuccessful, Chen Yi believed that Li Mi's troops, who had only six regiments and were stationed south of Weixian in Linqu at this time, were weak and could be deceived. He abandoned Nanma and besieged Linqu. After eight days of fierce fighting, he lost more than 40,000 people. By July 30th, the National Army's reinforcements arrived one after another. At this time, Chen Yi, who was already exhausted, had no fighting spirit and was deeply afraid of being annihilated. He fled to the north bank of the Yellow River, forming a complete retreat in the book. By this time, Chen Yi, who had boasted of having 230,000 troops after reorganization, had only 70,000 troops left. All of his rapid column's heavy weapons, unable to be transported across the Yellow River, were mostly buried in the area between the Xia Qing River and the Jiaoji Railway. The "July Offensive," led by the most tenacious Liu and Chen bandits from within the customs, which was supposed to "unveil the prelude to the great counteroffensive," had fallen from its peak to its lowest point.

The Third Stage

Due to the painful lessons learned in the second stage, the Shandong Communist bandits adopted a strategy that reverted to the first stage from August until recently. During this period, the Communist bandits, seeing that Jiaodong could not be defended and that the only route for receiving supplies from the Northeast was destined to be cut off, decided that rather than retreating to the north bank of the Yellow River to be beaten, it was better to "use the enemy's rear as the front," strive for the initiative, and adopt the "exchange space for space" tactic. Thus, Liu Bocheng's five columns, which were entrenched in the relatively complete southwestern Shandong, first crossed the Longhai Railway and fled to the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. At the same time, Chen Geng's troops in southern Shanxi also crossed the Yellow River and harassed Heluo in order to support and contain the Central Plains National Army. Following this, the remaining main force of Chen Yi, which had fled to the north bank of the Yellow River for replenishment and training and was not yet mature, consisting of six columns including the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 13th (of which the 13th column was part of Liu Bocheng's force and was placed under Chen Yi's command), also followed suit and crossed the Longhai Railway south on September 26 after failing to retreat to their old base in Yimeng. Chen Yi's original intention was to retreat to northern Jiangsu, but he was blocked and fled west to join Liu Bocheng.

At this time, the Communist bandits in Jiaodong also shouted out a new slogan, which was: "Abandon Shandong, but not Jiaodong; abandon Jiaodong, but not the Three Mountains; abandon the Three Mountains, but not the Shandong youth."

The so-called Three Mountains

Refer to Dazeshan (near Pingdu), Juchiya Mountain (southeast of Haiyang), and Kunlun Mountain (southeast of Muping) in Jiaodong. In terms of scale, the Three Mountains are not as large as Yishan and Mengshan in the Yimeng Mountain area, but they are more险峻. Juchiya Mountain is the most险峻. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist bandits managed them as the largest base for entering and exiting Jiaodong. There are natural caves and artificial tunnels, with all the caves connected and all the mountains jointly defending. There are arsenals, granaries, and warehouses in the caves. In particular, the number of grains, ammunition, and weapons stored in the warehouses cannot be estimated. The工事s are so strong that even the enemy's large-scale sweeps during the War of Resistance Against Japan failed to flatten them. Fortunately, the National Army has first cleared all the Communist bandits in Dazeshan and completely surrounded Juchiya Mountain. The bandits on Kunlun Mountain will also be easily cleared.

In short, although there are still seven regular army columns (the 2nd, 9th, and 7th columns and part of the 13th column are between Gaomi and Changyi; the main force of the 13th column is on Kunlun Mountain; the 10th and 11th columns are in Liangshan in southwestern Shandong - the 11th column is temporarily under Chen's command by Liu; and the Liangguang Column is in Dezhou in northern Shandong) and 100,000 local troops remaining in Shandong this month, it is still a

Difficult task

For the government to suppress the remaining bandits and pacify the local areas. (The reason why this task is difficult is that after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Li Yannian, who was in charge of Shandong's military affairs, reduced the local游繫隊 to nothing. Before the government's local armed forces are fully rebuilt, if the National Army's regular troops leave Shandong, the security of each county town may also have problems at any time.) But there is no doubt that the defeat of Chen Yi's original main force, the destruction of Chen Yi's Shandong base area, and the retreat of Liu and Chen's remaining main forces far away from their base area to the south are precisely the successes of the National Army's core tactical application. Liu and Chen are forced to retreat to guerilla warfare as the main method and mobile warfare as the supplement in strategy. All of this is a serious failure for the Communist bandits. Conversely, the serious failure of the Communist bandits is precisely the victory and success of the National Army.

Since Liu Bocheng fled south, the

Gan-E-Yu-Wan

Military Region has now been formally established, with Liu serving as the commander of the military region and the commander of the Central Plains Field Army concurrently. The former position of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region is now taken over by Nie Rongzhen. From this, it can be seen that at least Liu Bandit will not主动 flee for the time being, but will think of rebuilding his Central Plains Military Region. Although Chen Yi has temporarily joined forces with Liu, retreating to northern Jiangsu is his most desired first move, because northern Jiangsu is his old nest, Huaiyin. Even now, Chen Bandit's 11th and 12th columns, totaling about 20,000 people, are still scattered and lurking in northern Jiangsu. However, if there is an opportunity, retreating to Shandong again is also very possible, because he still兼攝s the commander of his Shandong Military Region. "Crossing the river this year and crossing the Yangtze River next year" is completely a practical offensive of the Communist bandits. In the Guannei, the National Army, which has now changed the Central Plains battlefield into the main battlefield, is using unparalleled perseverance and courage to shatter this attempt of the Communist bandits.

### Xiamen Customs Intercepts Huge Amount of Smuggled Gold

[Our Newspaper Xiamen 8th Dispatch] The Xiamen Customs recently received a tip that the Taiping Wheel, which sails between the Philippines and Xiamen, was smuggling a large amount of gold to Xiamen.

### Inside Story of the Labor Strike at Qingdao Qilu Company Rubber Factory

[Our Newspaper Qingdao 9th Dispatch] The Qingdao Qilu Enterprise Company's Rubber Factory, in order to cooperate with the National General Mobilization Order and to supply rubber products required by the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Communications, has established a production increase incentive program, increasing work by two hours per day, and giving each increased product a treatment of one and a half pieces. Since the factory proposed this motion, a small number of workers, not understanding the factory's motives, incited obstruction, and started a strike on August 12, refusing to extend the work, but demanding an increase in treatment. After repeated persuasion by the factory and mediation by the Social Bureau, there was no effect. Finally, the mayor arbitrated and changed the increase time in the production increase plan to one hour, and the treatment for each increased product was also increased by 20% compared to the original, calculated at 1.7. Since September 11, the worker side, due to the control of a small number of workers, did not follow the enemy's stipulated time, and the factory union set its own time to go to and from work, and the work efficiency was extremely low. The municipal authorities were very dissatisfied with this. In addition to ordering the union to stop its activities and wait for reorganization, the factory was allowed to dismiss the leading troublemakers, and strictly ordered to implement the regulations. If there were still those who did not comply, they could be refused entry into the factory. At 7:30 on the 13th, the workers gathered in the streets, seemingly manipulated by someone, and did not dare to enter the factory. The enemy side waited until 7:45, then closed the gate and temporarily suspended work. Later, they received an order from the Social Bureau that from the 21st, all workers who were willing to accept the factory's regulations should register. After registration, work would resume. On the evening of the 30th, registration was completed, and all work resumed on the morning of October 1st. However, on the day of resumption, the secretary of the general union actually released the absurd news that the factory had recognized four conditions for resumption, disrupting the public's perception to a great extent. The Social Bureau and the factory have separately corrected this. It is now known that the factory has submitted a statement to the Social Bureau, stating that this incorrect news is feared to cause other incidents and requesting serious attention.

[Our Hong Kong Correspondent] The Hong Kong Football League has already started for two weeks. Star Island has not yet returned. "Kitchee" can be considered the best among the Chinese teams, while "Sea Dragon" is the strongest team of foreign troops this year.

### A Brief Look at Shanghai University

— Bao Zhongqi

In Mr. Hu Shi's "Ten-Year Education Plan," he believed that the thirteen church universities in the country were relatively serious and successful in their education and should be included in the second batch of schools for development.

Indeed, among these thirteen church universities, especially in Shanghai, St. John's, Soochow, and Hangzhou Christian College were exceptional institutions.

According to the Academic Dean's report, Shanghai University has a total of 1,066 students this semester (male to female ratio: 55.5% male, 44.5% female), all of whom live on campus. This alone is enough to demonstrate the students' pursuit of knowledge and the simple academic atmosphere of Shanghai University.

In the 1947 new student enrollment, a total of 2,527 people applied in two rounds, with about a quarter being admitted, totaling 663 students. Before the start of this semester, all new students participated in new student training to give them a deep understanding of the school.

At the first weekly meeting of the semester, President Ling, who had just returned from the United States, personally attended and presided. He frankly stated the crux of the problems of the previous semester. Finally, he said in an extremely sincere tone: "Our Shanghai University is a big family. I hope that political parties will withdraw to create a peaceful and democratic new Shanghai University."

The spirit of a big family has indeed been fully demonstrated at Shanghai University. Once, a minor incident was triggered by careless washing of food in the men's dining hall. President Ling then announced in a democratic manner at a weekly meeting: "I have received many signed letters from male students telling me that unclean food has caused more than half of the students to suffer from diarrhea. I am willing to thoroughly investigate this matter!" As a result, the men's kitchen was replaced, and a dietary committee was organized by the students to manage it.

On the evening of September 22nd, a grand faculty-student social gathering was held in the auditorium. All faculty members and their wives attended. Among the performances, the "electric piano" solo by Mrs. Zhu Qidong, professor of the Music Department, was the most appreciated. The sound of the piano resembled a guzheng and a stringed instrument. The faculty and students enjoyed themselves to the fullest that day, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.

On the Mid-Autumn Festival evening, the Botanical Garden designed by Dr. Zheng Zhangcheng, Dean of the College of Science and Director of the Biology Department, was inaugurated. The Shanghai University Orchestra performed musical programs, which brought some comfort to the students' homesickness in this beautiful moonlit night. The biological garden is located near the Huangpu River, with lush trees, lotus ponds, and small bridges, providing another place for students to relax and chat after class. The students are all very happy about this.

November 8th is the anniversary of the school. A parents' day is planned to celebrate together. Preparations have already begun. In addition to the flower and tree donations from the student union in the campus, the construction of a fountain, sundial, and drinking fountain has also begun.

The gas equipment in the science building has been installed. The students of the Chemistry Department, who have been negotiating for years, all consider it great news. It will greatly increase the convenience for future experiments. Once the boiler is repaired, gas can be produced to supply the entire school. Amid the calls for power saving, this is another good news. A set of papermaking machines donated by Mr. Chen Pengnian, general manager of the Jiangnan Paper Mill, has been installed in the papermaking workshop. It is currently undergoing trial runs day and night and will soon be officially put into operation. The students of the Chemistry Department are particularly excited and are now buying work clothes, their faces full of spring breeze.

The physics students are unwilling to let the biology and chemistry departments have all the spotlight. They have now established a new weather forecasting station, truly competing with each other.

The volunteer primary school run by the education students has achieved remarkable results and has been expanded. Children of faculty and staff, as well as out-of-school children from nearby villages, can enroll nearby. This and the internship of the sociology students—the Shanghai East Commune—are known as Shanghai University's two major charitable initiatives.

Many new faculty and staff were hired in 1947. The three-story faculty apartment building, which began construction this summer, has been completed. The interior is equipped with complete sanitary facilities, and the exterior is magnificent. It is the most sublime of the existing apartments on campus. The total cost is more than 70,000 US dollars, adding a new look to the whole school. Female students occupy "Si Lei" and "Si Meng" halls, first-year male students live in Si Yi hall, second-year students live in Si Pei hall, and third- and fourth-year students live in "Men's Dormitory," which is called Women's Hall in English.

The school authorities pay much attention to students' extracurricular activities and sports. The previous session won four championships in "Mandarin Speech," "English Speech," men's track and field, and women's basketball, establishing Shanghai University's reputation. Therefore, various competitions have recently started on campus to prepare for the future.

During this trip to the United States, President Ling reported to the church on the recent situation of Shanghai University, attended the Danish Baptist Conference, and spoke on the current situation of education in China. In addition to receiving an honorary doctorate in the United States, he also visited universities in the United Kingdom and the United States for reference. We hope that he can continue to develop Shanghai University with the vigor of a young man (President Ling is the youngest university president) and make it the first-class institution of higher learning in Shanghai!

### Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Imported Goods to be Announced Soon

Regarding the handling of goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, the official of the Transport Management Committee said yesterday that the government will solve this problem soon, and there is no problem for the imported goods for which foreign exchange has been settled. In particular, industrial raw materials will be given priority. What the government is currently considering is the goods that have been imported but not settled. It is feared that once they are opened up, it will be necessary to search for them in the black market, and they are deeply wary of the recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Therefore, there are some differences of opinion between the Transport Management Committee and the Executive Yuan. However, the handling measures should be announced in the short term.

### South China Transport Management Committee Considers Common Certificates

The use of Hong Kong's Common Certificates has caused fluctuations in the Hong Kong market. On the 22nd of last month, the South China Customs stopped using them. After the request of overseas Chinese businessmen, it was approved again on the 2nd of this month that those issued before the 21st of last month were still valid. As a result, various parties continued to compete for the Common Certificates.

According to the person in charge of the Transport Management Committee, he said: Regarding the situation of the Common Certificates, no report has been received so far. The so-called Common Certificates were originally issued by the South China Import and Export Management Committee and the Customs to facilitate border merchants to transport livestock, eggs, and the like, duty-free and without foreign exchange settlement, to Hong Kong for sale. At the same time, they would use the Hong Kong dollars they sold to purchase materials of equivalent value, and the Customs would issue a "Agricultural Products Exchange Import Certificate," which was originally a very good intention. However, it was exploited by some special people, who rushed to buy them and purchase imported materials, thus becoming Common Certificates, which was completely unexpected at the time. The South China Transport Management Committee and the Customs are taking effective measures to deal with this situation, and whether to continue issuing them is also determined by the South China Transport Management Committee.

### Improving the Cotton Yarn Price Negotiation System, Measures Still Under Discussion, Allocated Yarn Maintains Original Price, Black Market Prices Soar

[Our Report] Although the existing cotton yarn price negotiation system of the Textile Adjustment Committee adopts a dynamic approach, it is still out of sync when compared with the soaring yarn prices in recent days. Governor Zhang of the National Bank of China convened representatives from the cotton textile industry last week to discuss improving the existing price negotiation system, and it was decided that the improvement measures would be decided after consultation with Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Minister Chen arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He told reporters that the issue of improving the price negotiation system is still under consideration and there is no conclusion. Yesterday, the Textile Adjustment Committee's cotton yarn [missing character] price remained unchanged, with 20-count yarn still listed at 15.2 million yuan.

Yarn Prices Soar

Yesterday, in the cotton yarn market, economic police [missing character] (came to supervise, so that each yarn was traded with a legal profit of 5% in addition to the limit price, but very few speculators arrived, resulting in no formal transactions and a standstill. However, there were still sporadic bidding outside the market, and the rise was even more fierce, with 42-count Jianfeng fine yarn approaching the 40 million yuan mark, shouted at 39 million yuan. 40-count was 34.5 million yuan, 32-count Silver Moon was 30 million yuan, 20-count Double Horse was 25.5 million yuan, and 16-count Guangming was 25 million yuan, most of which rose by 2 to 3 million yuan each. Also: The Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual, with no price change. There were ten types of A-group replica manufacturers, 1,550 pieces, each piece with an additional 250,000 yuan for flood relief costs in addition to the list price, and 922 households applied for purchase. It is reported that B-group yarn merchants have suspended allocation this period.

Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply

In the cotton cloth market, the opening was due to frequent withdrawals by floating funds and customers, and the market was unanimously [missing character] high due to soaring raw material prices. Manufacturers did not open, chips became scarcer, and the market rose sharply. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped from 925,000 yuan to 990,000 yuan, and it was still difficult to collect, a sharp [missing character] of 130,000 yuan compared to Saturday. Other grades of fine cloth also rose sharply by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan each. Later, due to the economic police [missing character] supervising the market, the atmosphere inside the market suddenly [missing character] dissipated, and buying and selling stopped. However, the Dragon Head fine cloth price outside the market was shouted at 1.03 million yuan, and Four Gentlemen fabric was shouted at 1.23 million yuan, with no formal transactions. Other bleached cloth, twill cloth, colored cloth, and native cloth all rose sharply, ranging from 56,000 to 350,000 yuan.

Spot Cotton Tight

Yesterday's spot cotton market was chaotic, with inconsistent bids. Yarn mills were mostly watching, and peers were slightly doing business. The highest price for Ling cotton was 4.9 million yuan, up another 400,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, and other grades also rose, but there were not many transactions. The delivery [missing character] price was 4.85 million yuan for Shashi cotton, and the ex-warehouse price was 4.72 million to 4.9 million yuan for Lingdou cotton, 3.62 million yuan for Han coarse cotton, 4.5 million to 4.65 million yuan for Han fine cotton, and 3.7 million to 3.8 million yuan for Fire Machine cotton. 900 bales were transacted, and Zhoupu seed cotton was 720,000 yuan.

### Authorities Deny Issuance of Large Denomination Notes

At a time when prices are soaring and people's livelihoods are difficult, it was rumored in the market that the National Bank of China intends to print large denomination notes of 50,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan to meet current needs, which gave the market a major stimulus. According to inquiries with relevant parties, it was generally believed that there was no such thing, and there was no need for it now, and they all solemnly denied it. Not long ago, there was a similar rumor in the market that large denomination notes would be issued. The spokesman of the National Bank of China has already denied it. Unexpectedly, not long after, the rumors started again, and the relevant authorities will investigate those who deliberately spread [missing character] rumors.

### Rice Market Rises Fiercely, High-Quality Japonica Rice Approaches 800,000 Yuan Mark, Edible Oil Continues to be Sold Off, Price Still Rises

Yesterday, a total of more than 15,200 stones of rice and grain arrived in the north and south markets. In the southern market, the morning market rose fiercely, and high-quality japonica rice once approached the 800,000 yuan mark.

The oil market had very few goods and very few transactions, with no formal prices, and continued to rise by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan each. China Plant Oil Factory continued to sell off, and the factory distributed soybean oil, vegetable oil, and hot dish oil, a total of five barrels per household, all of which were recognized by retailers, and the prices remained unchanged.

### Worsted Yarn Sells Well, Price Rises

Yesterday, in the worsted yarn market, as the weather gradually [missing character] warmed, the sales in this area and other places were very smooth. The buying atmosphere in the market was booming, and the transaction prices rose crazily. Fine worsted yarns of various brands with four strands rose to 720,000 yuan per pound, a crazy leap of 140,000 yuan compared to last week.

### Further Increases in Artificial Silk Prices

Yesterday's artificial silk market was unusually chaotic, as authorities were monitoring it very closely, and no trading was heard of within the market. In the morning, the asking price outside the market was around 85 million yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to as high as 93 million yuan for a transaction. New high prices emerged one after another, which was astonishing. Finally, due to rumors that loans had been granted, confidence softened, and the selling price dropped to 89 million yuan.

Factory Yarn

Yesterday's market was also chaotic. The asking prices for all grades of five-bundle yarn were lacking. With artificial silk prices soaring, everyone was holding out for higher prices. Some single-bundle transactions occurred, priced between 6.6 million and 7 million yuan. Thousand-strand yarn also rose in tandem. In the afternoon, the asking price for single-bundle yarn reached 50 million yuan.

### Tea Market Transactions Scarce

Since the huge fluctuations in commodity prices in this city, tea merchants' minds are unwilling to lie low. They are unilaterally bullish on the red and general tea varieties, and supply is becoming increasingly scarce. Although shopkeepers and merchants from this street and from places like Suzhou and Wuxi are still inquiring, transactions have sharply declined, the trend is becoming more firm, and the market continues to show promise. Other types of export teas are also similar. The market is quite quiet. Looking at this situation, there is hope for a prosperous future.

### Northern Transportation Frequently Blocked, Affecting Coal Transport, Coal Prices Rise Due to Abnormal Supply

[Report from this newspaper] According to information from the Fuel Management Committee: On the Beining Railway line, between Shanhaiguan and Tangshan, railway sabotage has been frequent since late last month. Traffic has been intermittent, and military transport has to be maintained occasionally, resulting in reduced coal transport volume. A telegram received on the 8th of this month from Qinhuangdao stated that the committee had five ships loading coal there, including the "Tangshan," which were temporarily ordered to suspend loading for official duties by the local military authorities and only returned on the 10th, which greatly affected coal transport. Also, the "Tianxing" and "Nanshan" ships were requisitioned for official duties after arriving in Taiwan and were only allowed to leave in early this month, affecting the amount of coal arriving in Taiwan.

The committee has been increasing the monthly supply of coal for military and public use in Qingdao. The plan for this month is 15,000 tons. Recently, due to the obstruction of coal sources, the planned shipment of coal cannot be delivered on time. Currently, the "New China" ship, which is already loaded with coal en route, has been ordered to rush to Qingdao, carrying a total of 7,200 tons, of which 3,000 tons are allocated to the China Textile Corporation and 4,200 tons to the power plant. The Taipei office has also been ordered to load 5,000 tons of coal in Qinhuangdao and transport it to Qingdao immediately.

It is now known that the coal in use at the coal plant there can last until the 17th of this month. With the additional coal supply transported by ships dispatched by the committee, there is no risk of power outages in Qingdao. Furthermore, the Beining Railway has recently been repaired through continuous efforts, and railway transport has returned to normal since the 10th. At the same time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been consulted to request that coal transport ships be exempted from requisition.

Also, the supply of coal for military and public use in this city has never been interrupted. Although general coal transport has experienced malfunctions upon arrival in Shanghai, the committee's supply has been maintained. Since manufacturers have been allowed to transport their own coal, over the past two weeks, a total of more than 18,000 tons of self-transported coal has arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, the rise in coal prices is due to an abnormal supply-demand situation. The fourth phase of factory coal has been increased from 15,000 tons to 20,000 tons and will be distributed soon. It is expected that coal prices will return to normal soon.

### Speculative Funds Cause Waves, Chinese Stocks Rise Sharply and Fall Back Quickly

Yesterday, Chinese stocks suddenly experienced a general surge, especially second-tier and miscellaneous stocks. As the authorities are monitoring the markets more closely, speculators have infiltrated Chinese stocks in large numbers. At noon, a sharp rise was reported, with 70-80% of stocks hitting their daily limit. In the afternoon, credit tightened, and there were rumors of borrowing. After rising sharply, stocks quickly fell back.

Yung Chong was pushed to the daily limit by No. 157 and others, China Silk by No. 219, and New Asia Underwear and King Lun were pushed to the limit by No. 231. For a time, buying was very strong. As various industries were strictly prohibited from engaging in activities, a large amount of speculative funds poured in. Near noon, No. 154 and others all entered. Yungsha rose to a high of 350 yuan for immediate delivery and 358 yuan for forward delivery. French Sino-Chinese Northern Match, Pen Mud, and Meiya Sino-Foreign all approached their limits.

No. 32 and others sold off, and No. 76 and others sold Yungsha for immediate delivery again, gradually falling to a low of 3126 yuan and 338 yuan. No. 116 and others still absorbed it at low prices, and Yungsha rose back to 343 yuan and 345 yuan at the close.

Yesterday, foreign stocks continued to advance to new highs, but retreated after rising.

### Talking About Shanghai Telephones

— Wang Dachun

1.  Two Different Telephone Systems Create Many Shortcomings

Previously, Shanghai's city telephones were operated separately by two organizations: the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company. The Shanghai Telephone Company's business area included the former International Settlement and the French Concession, as well as the extra-settlement road areas in northwestern Sichuan Road. Its machinery adopted a rotary automatic system. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau's area included the urban area outside the above-mentioned areas, and its machinery adopted a step-by-step automatic system. After the victory, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau received the "Shanghai Telephone Administration Bureau" of the puppet "Huazhong Electric Communications Company," returned the occupied part of the telephone company to its original owner, and assigned the former Shanghai Telephone Bureau to the Party Telecommunications Bureau, and all systems remained as before. The telephone company operates in commercially prosperous areas, with more than 58,000 current users and nine branch offices. Its telephone numbers are arranged as follows:

Central Bureau "1" automatic telephone capacity 9,300 numbers

Hongqiao Bureau "29" manual common battery telephone capacity 310 numbers

Jiangsu Bureau "2" manual common battery telephone capacity 4,100 numbers

West Bureau "3," "6," and "62" automatic telephone capacity 11,900 numbers

Also "62" semi-automatic telephone capacity 700 numbers

North Bureau "4" automatic telephone capacity 6,800 numbers

Huishan Bureau "5" automatic telephone capacity 3,300 numbers

Fenyang Bureau "7" automatic telephone capacity 9,900 numbers

Also "68" semi-automatic telephone capacity 1,000 numbers

Yunnan Bureau "8" automatic telephone capacity 8,600 numbers

Fujian Bureau "9" automatic telephone capacity 8,000 numbers

The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's telephone currently has about 4,000 users and eight branch offices. Its telephone numbers are arranged as follows:

City Center Bureau "5" automatic telephone capacity 600 numbers

Hongkou Bureau "6" automatic telephone capacity 2,600 numbers

Nanshi Bureau "7" automatic telephone capacity 1,000 numbers

Longhua Bureau "74" manual common battery telephone capacity 120 numbers

Pudong Bureau "75" manual common battery telephone capacity 300 numbers

Zhenru Bureau "64" manual magneto telephone capacity 50 numbers

Wusong Bureau "65" manual magneto telephone capacity 50 numbers

Fuxing Island Bureau "66" manual common battery telephone capacity 60 numbers

Due to the fundamental differences in the telephone systems of the two organizations, the cumbersome procedures for connecting lines between the two are unavoidable. The biggest shortcoming is that both use a five-digit system, and there are many identical user numbers between them. For example, the company's Fenyang Bureau has 70731, and the Telecommunications Bureau's Nanshi also has the same number. Assuming that special connection procedures are not used, users who dial 70731 from the company's Fenyang Bureau will inevitably be connected to Nanshi by mistake. Similarly, users who dial 62233, a semi-automatic telephone number of the company's West Bureau, will definitely be connected to Hongkou by mistake, causing a huge error. Furthermore, due to the different systems of the two parties, their machinery cannot be used interchangeably, and even the desire to make up for each other's shortcomings is not allowed by the facts, resulting in difficulties in supplying telephones.

2.  "02" and "Dial 0"

Due to the different procedures for telephones between the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, users cannot dial directly between them and must use special connection procedures, namely, the "02" connection and first dialing the "0" digit. This method involves installing an "02" connection station between the telephone company and the Telecommunications Bureau, with operators on duty to connect the lines. This station has 20 pairs of relay lines to the City Center Bureau, 80 pairs to the Hongkou, Wusong, Zhenru, and Fuxing Island Bureaus, and 70 pairs to the Nanshi, Longhua, and Pudong Bureaus. Telephone company users who dial "02" telephones are all connected through this exchange station. During busy times, if more than 80 people are simultaneously dialing the "6" digit telephone in Hongkou, they will hear an "engaged" tone. As for the Telecommunications Bureau connecting to the telephone company, there is no separate exchange station. Instead, the "0" digit is used in the automatic machine's vacant position, and a repeater is installed on the middle trunk line. The user simply dials the "0" digit, and the repeater directly sends its pulse electricity to the company's selector, providing the company's track surface for dialing. Therefore, "02" users who dial a company telephone must wait for two track surface sounds. Only after hearing the Telecommunications Bureau's track surface sound and dialing the "0" digit, and then hearing the company's track surface sound, can they dial the number to avoid errors. Currently, there are 100 trunk lines from Nanshi to the company, 125 from Hongkou, and 25 from the City Center. Under the current circumstances, this should meet the needs, but during busy business hours, it is still inevitable to encounter an engaged tone.

3.  Reasons for Engagement

Whenever we make a phone call, we hear the "buzzing" sound of an engaged line. When we need to connect to a telephone, hearing the engaged tone often causes emotional agitation. However, in a large metropolis like Shanghai, where there are already more than 60,000 telephone users, it is unavoidable to encounter an engaged line. Currently, there are as many as 17 large and small telephone bureaus in Shanghai. Between the bureaus, hundreds to thousands of pairs of relay lines are used to connect them. When a user dials the first number, except for those with the same first digit as their telephone number, they must first pass through this relay line to reach the telephone bureau of the called user, and then select the line. For example, if a user with the number 72382 wants to call 42333, after dialing the first digit "4," the pulse electricity will move the first group of selectors in the "7" digit position of the Fenyang Bureau, and then directly reach the second group of selectors in the "4" digit position of the North Bureau via the relay line, and then accept the dialing pulse electricity of 2333, eventually connecting to the called user. There are currently 600 pairs of these relay lines from the Fenyang Bureau to the North Bureau, and the two bureaus have a total of about 15,000 users — about 9,600 in the Fenyang Bureau and about 4,400 in the North Bureau. Communication between them must go through these 600 pairs back and forth. If more than 600 people are communicating at the same time, those who come later will hear an engaged tone. Currently, in the business districts of Shanghai, the relay lines between telephone bureaus such as the Central and Fujian Bureaus, the Central and Fourth Bureaus, and the Fujian and West Bureaus all have more than 1,000 pairs each. In residential districts, the relay lines between telephone bureaus such as the West Bureau and the Jiangsu Bureau, and the Jiangsu Bureau and the Fenyang Bureau also have 800 pairs each. However, as the number of users increases and the types of calls become more frequent, encountering an engaged line is almost unavoidable. Furthermore, communication between users often lasts a long time due to business negotiations, or there may be lingering love talk that does not end for a long time. Relay lines are occupied for a long time, making it impossible for later users to pass through the relay lines. This is another reason why people hear an engaged tone.

4.  Basic Rationalization and Improvement

The key to improving Shanghai's telephone system is to unify the system. The current two telephone systems in Shanghai — rotary and step-by-step — each have their advantages, but the rotary telephone system has a capacity of about 20 times that of the step-by-step system. In terms of the cost of improvement, it is more economical to switch to the rotary system. Looking at the future development of Shanghai, the relative importance of the urban area and the suburbs has not yet been determined, but to cope with the future progress of telephones, a system with elasticity must be adopted. Because the rotary system has the characteristic of Register-Translator, it is elastic. From a technical point of view, no matter how the future develops, the improvement plan can be carried out without being restricted after the city adopts the rotary automatic system, and there is no risk of wasting resources in terms of economy. Moreover, because the rotary system uses a register translator, it has a larger capacity, and the distribution of inter-bureau relay lines can also be economical. Especially for two bureaus that are far apart, the Tandem Trunking method can be used, without the need to set up direct relay lines that are very long and not busy. This type of relay method can reduce communication costs and provide high-quality and affordable services, allowing all citizens to enjoy the supply of telephones more. However, to implement this improvement plan, two points must first be adjusted:

Regulation of the block area of each bureau. Due to the fact that the telephone company monopolized the area of the former two concessions, the number of users in each bureau is not evenly distributed. The bureaus in the central area have small areas and dense users, requiring more mechanical keys. The suburban blocks are wide and sparsely populated, with few users and long lines. Moreover, the installation areas of each overlap. The distribution of lines is really unsuitable. Within the improvement plan, it is appropriate to regulate the rational business area of each bureau in the city to enable users to install machines and develop evenly.

Reform of telephone numbers. Currently, all Shanghai telephones use a five-digit system. Because the two organizations each have the same first digit, special connection procedures have to be adopted, causing many shortcomings. After the system is unified in the future, the "02" and "Dial 0" will be cancelled, and a six-digit dialing system must be adopted. Experts have researched the format and found that using six digits, with a dash between the first two digits and the last four digits, such as 21-1234, 73-1234, etc., can make it easier for users to remember. Currently, the improvement plan has been planned by technical personnel from both sides several times, but because mechanical equipment is not easy to purchase, and economic and financial resources must be planned in advance, it will take some time to see the results.

### How to Send News Telegrams

— Diao Zhibing

I am a telecommunications worker and also a soldier working in the press. Therefore, among the thousands of telegrams I handle daily, including ordinary, urgent, express, social, night letters, and military, I naturally pay the most attention to news telegrams.

Shanghai's press is the most developed in the country, with numerous newspapers, plus special correspondents from out-of-town newspapers stationed in Shanghai and foreign journalists. The number of news telegrams sent out of Shanghai every day is very considerable. These telegrams are of good quality and quantity, and most of them are important and time-sensitive. Therefore, whenever I receive such a telegram, I always process them at high speed, hoping to catch up with the publication time of their newspapers, so as not to delay and lose their news value.

In my work over the past two months, most of the news telegrams I have handled have met the ideal requirements, making them very easy to process. It does not take an hour to transmit them to the other party. For example, it used to take three or four hours for a foreign language news telegram sent from Nanjing to Shanghai, but since August, it has been shortened to about one hour to arrive. And the processing time in Shanghai is less than 30 minutes, which shows the high efficiency of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau in processing news telegrams. However, a few have illegible handwriting, blurred codes, and too many additions, deletions, or corrections, causing difficulties in the work of receiving and sending telegrams, which affects their accuracy and causes unnecessary losses in time. It is a pity that we sometimes see "Telegram unclear" or "Special telegram not arrived" written in parentheses in the newspaper, or the publication time of the newspaper is delayed due to waiting for the telegram. To give another recent example, when General Wedemeyer arrived in Shanghai, a reporter stationed in Shanghai from a newspaper in another city interviewed and obtained important news that Wedemeyer would visit Madame Sun Yat-sen in the afternoon and meet with representatives of various parties and celebrities from the community. He wrote the telegram and sent someone to send it late at night, but he was too rushed when writing it, and he forgot to register the telegram. Moreover, the codes in the telegram were also extremely blurred, making it difficult to identify. After repeatedly inquiring and correcting, he wasted two hours, and as a result, he failed to catch up with the publication time of the newspaper. The news became history. An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, and the precious time of two hours is really difficult to calculate its value. A moment of haste and negligence caused an irreparable loss.

Based on the above reasons, I would like to make some important points to my friends in the press and ask them to cooperate and pay attention to improvement in order to save time, improve work efficiency, and eliminate this unnecessary and irreparable loss. This is not only convenient for others, but also convenient for yourself.

Please use the forms provided by this bureau or your own newspaper to write. Write the letters in small squares and translate the codes in large squares.

Please write clearly, and do not make corrections in the telegram to avoid confusion.

It is best to write with a pen or brush. A pencil is also acceptable, but it must be clear and easy to see, avoiding illegible handwriting.

It is best to translate the codes yourself. Otherwise, send them before midnight. After midnight, there is a shortage of manpower, and news telegrams are not as ordinary as ordinary telegrams. They are all long, with hundreds or thousands of words, and it takes too long to translate the codes, so they cannot be sent out in time.

The sender must hold the permit issued by the Telecommunications Administration Bureau for sending news telegrams for verification.

The newspaper seal and the reporter's signature and seal should be affixed to the telegram.

Because news telegrams inevitably make people think of general telegrams. Common mistakes in general telegrams are:

Writing the name of the place.

Forgetting to write the telegram registration number.

Writing the name and address of the sender.

Writing in a small square and translating codes in a large square.

There are words in the telegram that have not been translated into codes.

The telegram is illegible, and there are too many simplified characters.

We are currently engaged in a major telecommunications revolution to ensure that express telegrams do not take more than one and a half hours, urgent telegrams do not take more than four hours, and ordinary telegrams do not take more than eight hours to arrive. With our subjective efforts, the facts prove that we are already close to this standard. If everyone pays attention to the errors listed above and improves them objectively, then we will be able to shorten the time further, reduce errors, and achieve accuracy and speed.

### Soviet Telecommunications Plan

In March 1946, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided on the Soviet Union's new five-year telecommunications plan (from 1946 to 1950). This plan includes: using the latest technology to restore and expand radio communications in areas that have been occupied by German troops. Building reliable telegraph and telephone communications between Moscow and various administrative centers and between the capitals of various republics and their administrative centers. Restoring and building 7,000 kilometers of major telegraph and telephone cables. Installing 55 radio telegraph and telephone transmitters, 20 of which will be suspended and established in central Soviet Union to strengthen communications in the Far East, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Expanding the automatic telephone equipment of various telecommunications bureaus. Adding 28 broadcasting stations. Restoring and transforming the Moscow television station and adding three television stations in Leningrad, Kiev, and Sverdlovsk. (Fan)

### "The Public" and "Telecommunications"

— Li Jiqing

Telecommunications is a public utility. Therefore, all improvements in telecommunications facilities should be aimed at "the public." The various new methods implemented by the Telecommunications Bureau recently are completely aimed at making it more convenient and faster for "the public" to send telegrams and make telephone calls. On the contrary, what should the public's attitude towards the Telecommunications Bureau be? In our opinion, it should be as follows:

Frankly urge improvement The Telecommunications Bureau is currently striving to improve the handling of telegrams and telephone calls every day. However, due to various restrictions such as manpower, materials, and financial resources, there are still many areas where it cannot be done perfectly. In addition to the Telecommunications Bureau paying attention to and striving to improve at any time, it is also hoped that the public will provide as much supervision and guidance as possible. If there is anything wrong, please frankly inform the Telecommunications Bureau. The Telecommunications Bureau must sincerely accept such opinions or suggestions and try to implement them one by one.

Please make full use of telegrams and telephones The Telecommunications Bureau welcomes the public to make full use of and criticize the various equipment and new methods implemented for telegrams and telephones. The more the public uses them, the more the Telecommunications Bureau will "use their brains" and try to make the public enjoy more convenience. Currently, the fees for telegrams and telephones are still very cheap compared to general commodity prices. Sending a telegram or making a long-distance telephone call to relatives and friends in distant places will definitely achieve unexpected results!

"The Public" and "Telecommunications" are inseparable in modern life. We sincerely hope that "the public" will constantly supervise and guide "telecommunications" and make extensive use of them. The Telecommunications Bureau should naturally sincerely accept their guidance and criticism, and at all times try to actively improve telegrams and telephones and seek convenience and speed for them. This kind of mutual assistance is a good way to seek progress.

### Common Sense of Telecommunications Lectures

— Zhang Jiayu

Lecture 3: How to Choose Special Services

The standard service that a telegraph bureau provides to its customers is that the sending bureau (i.e., the telegraph bureau at the sender's location) dispatches telegrams according to the order in which they are received. The telegrams are then transmitted directly via a long-distance circuit or indirectly via an intermediate bureau (when there is no direct long-distance circuit between the sending and receiving bureaus, it may be necessary to pass through one or more intermediate bureaus for relay) to the receiving bureau (i.e., the telegraph bureau at the recipient's location). The receiving bureau then arranges the telegrams in the order they were received, adds any necessary corrections and transmits them via a courier along a set route to the recipient. The "special services" discussed here refer to situations where the customer is willing to pay a commensurate price to request the telegraph bureau to provide services beyond the standard service that are faster, more reliable, more thorough, and more convenient. Alternatively, the customer may wish to have the telegram transmitted and delivered before its place in the standard delivery order, or be willing to accept certain restrictions stipulated by the telegraph bureau in exchange for lower rates. By way of analogy to postal services, if we consider the postal service for regular mail as the standard service, then sending airmail or express mail would be a special service where the sender requests faster service. Registered mail and insured mail would be special services where the sender requests more thorough and reliable service. Issuing postal money orders and handling subscriptions to newspapers and magazines are special services provided by the post office to give senders more convenient service. Sending postcards and printed matter are special services where the sender is willing to accept restrictions on size or content in order to obtain reduced postage rates.

When sending mail, other than standard service regular mail, the sender must write words like "Airmail," "Express," "Single Registered," "Double Registered," "Printed Matter," etc., in the upper left corner of the envelope, or affix various small labels specially printed by the post office. Similarly, when a sender submits a telegram that falls outside the standard service ordinary telegram, or if the telegram is an ordinary telegram but the sender requests the telegraph bureau to provide more thorough, reliable, or convenient services than the standard service during transmission and delivery, a specific telegraph bureau identifier must be added to the beginning of the text (i.e., before the recipient's name and address). This identifier is called the paid service identifier, or simply the paid identifier.

In a letter, the sender can choose two or more special services of a non-conflicting nature simultaneously, such as "Airmail Express" or "Airmail Express Printed Matter," or airmail express letters with money orders attached. Similarly, in a telegram, if the sender deems it necessary, they can also choose two or more non-conflicting special services within the same telegram, such as "Reply Paid, Prepaid Reply Fee," "Reply Paid, Collation, Distribution," and so on.

Various special services applicable to domestic telegrams include those requesting faster service, such as express (identifier LTN) and urgent (identifier D), and those offering reduced rates, such as night letter (identifier NLT) and social telegram (identifier SLT). The purpose and effect of the above special services have already been briefly explained in the second lecture, so they will not be repeated here. Here, let us explain the various special services that provide more reliable, thorough, and convenient services, as follows: (To be continued in the third section)

### Heart of the Telegraph Communication Network: A Glimpse of the Central Office

— Yu Angxiao

The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's wireless transmitter is located at the Nanxiang Transmitting Station, and the receiver is at the Liuhang Receiving Station. Both locations are connected to the main business office on Fuzhou Road by cables. The "Central Office," a department situated between the two, is, as its name suggests, the "central control station" for telegraph communication, fully demonstrating its importance.

The Central Office is a purely technical organization responsible for communicating between the transmitting and receiving stations and the telegraph office on Fuzhou Road. It is responsible for maintaining and improving all the machines and equipment of the Fuzhou Road Bureau. Under the supervision of the chief engineer, wireless and wired engineers are in charge of their respective areas. The Central Office is further divided into the "Wireless Adjustment Room," "Wired Adjustment Room," "General Repair Shop," wireless and wired "Telegraph Office Repair Room," as well as the "Motor Generator Room," "Battery Room," and "Oil Engine Generator Room." It can be said that it is "integrated into zero," with division of labor and cooperation, covering all aspects.

The wired and wireless adjustment rooms can also be said to be the "terminal rooms" for wireless and wired telegraphs. They are the most important part of the Central Office's subordinate units. Their function is equivalent to the heart of a human body, serving as the distribution center for transmitting and receiving circuits. All wireless signals received from various locations by the Liuhang Receiving Station are first transmitted through cables to the switchboard in the Wireless Adjustment Room. After passing through the amplifier in the Adjustment Room, they are then connected to the recording machine in the telegraph office for the telegraph operators to record. Signals sent out from the communication desk are also first connected to the Adjustment Room, and then systematically connected to the transmitter at the transmitting station by the Adjustment Room. In addition to managing the carrier wave machine, the Wired Adjustment Room is naturally a world of "wires" with "thousands of strands," all under its control. Therefore, the technical staff on duty in the Adjustment Room appear to be in the role of "brokers." They must be responsible for notifying the "opening" or "closing" of the transmitting and receiving machines, adjusting the wavelength, adjusting the sound, testing the accuracy of the automatic mechanism in the telegraph office, testing the quality of circuits in various locations, and determining the location of any damage and how to deal with it. When the telephone is busy, the "brokers" are constantly talking and overwhelmed, with one or two people on duty, more tense than the stock exchange.

To prevent the circuits going to Nanxiang from being damaged, the Wireless Adjustment Room experimented with "remote control" using ultra-short waves this spring. The advantage of ultra-short waves is that they can "return fully loaded." A small ultra-short wave machine, attached to a carrier wave machine, is sufficient to replace more than a dozen remote control lines, and can simultaneously "air transport" many signals to the transmitter in Nanxiang. However, at the beginning of the experiment, in a Shanghai full of high-rise buildings, the design and installation of the "directional antenna" took a lot of effort, but now it has achieved remarkable success. Once a certain number of "Nanxiang lines" are damaged, simply turn on the ultra-short wave machine without panic. This is a great contribution to the efficiency of communication.

The General Repair Shop is simply a small factory: lathes, benches, and various other equipment are available. Malfunctioning parts, such as typewriters, perforating machines, and recording machines, are "treated" here. The Telegraph Office Repair Room is their "branch factory," with a constant stream of "broken things" being sent in and "good things" being sent out every day. As for the complicated wireless part, in addition to being handled by technical assistants at any time, engineers also personally step in to perform "miraculous recoveries."

Another thing worth mentioning is the "soul" of the telegraph: power supply. We know that the Central Office has various machines that need electricity to maintain their activity, and their "appetite" for "eating electricity" varies. The Central Office has two places that regularly supply power: one is the Motor Generator Room, where the power company supplies 380 volts of "electric power," which is then "generated" by the electric motor into 110 volts of direct current for the automatic machines and perforating machines in the telegraph office, 180 volts of direct current for the telegraph keys, and 220 and 110 volts of alternating current for amplifiers, monitoring receivers, and recorders. The other is the Battery Room, which is dedicated to supplying the 130 volts of direct current required by the carrier wave machines in the Wired Adjustment Room. Every day, technical assistants pay attention to the dryness and temperature of the room, and the adjustment of the electrolyte level.

However, if the external power suddenly goes out, it would be a fatal blow to the Central Office. Therefore, the Central Office also has a "backup vehicle" in place: the standby oil engine generator room, which generates electricity using a diesel engine. If the power company cuts off power, we can also supply 380 volts of alternating current ourselves. We also conduct regular drills to avoid improvising at the last minute.

In short, since all the staff in the Central Office are machine operators, their work may not be as orderly as that of other departments, but some of them work hard, some work physically, some have to design huge projects, and some have to climb up and down all day, working with oily machines and tangled wires, burying themselves in hard work, but always playing the role of "backstage heroes." Not to mention if it lacks the Central Office—even if the Central Office occasionally suffers a heart weakness, the entire telegraph communication of Shanghai would be unimaginable.

### Random Thoughts on Grapes

— Shufeng

The transplantation of grapes to China dates back to the second century BC. The Book of Han records: "The state of Dayuan governs the area around Guishan City, where grapes are used to make wine. Wealthy people store up to ten thousand dan of wine, and it can last for decades without spoiling. Zhang Qian first introduced [grape] seeds to Emperor Wu, who planted grapes extensively. Many grape arbors were built beside the emperor's detached palaces and official residences." This is clear evidence, and moreover, as soon as grapes were introduced, they were planted to the extent of "many grape arbors," which shows the general fondness for these vermilion, round grapes at the time. Emperor Wen of Wei even praised grapes as "sweet but not cloying, crisp but not sour, cool but not cold, with a long taste and abundant juice," which can be said to be the highest praise for this fragrant, intense, ambrosia-like fruit.

Chinese records of grapes all say that they are produced in the Western Regions. Most of the ancient Western Regions are now the area of Central Asia. Indeed, in that area, especially in the Amu Darya river basin in Central Asia, grapes grow wild naturally, and it is even possible to find vines as thick as two people can embrace, and grape clusters two feet long and weighing more than ten pounds. The Book of Tang also records: "Dashi [Arabia], originally Persian territory, presents noble grapes every year, the large ones being like chicken eggs." The Complete Treatise on Agriculture also says: "...Yunnan's are as large as...those from Persia, as large as chicken eggs." If the grapes are as large as chicken eggs, then naturally the vines must be large enough for two people to embrace. Compared to the medium-sized grapes from Hebei and Shandong that we can see, it is a huge difference.

Grapes also have another name called "Granted Purple Cherry." Xu Guangqi's Complete Treatise on Agriculture of the Ming Dynasty says, "...Grapes, also known as Granted Purple Cherry. The Guang Zhi says: There are three kinds, yellow, white, and black; Crystal grapes have a white halo like powder, are large and long, and taste sweet; Purple grapes are black, and there are two kinds, large and small, with both sour and sweet tastes; Green grapes come from Shu [Sichuan]; the color is green when ripe, but the green grapes of the Western Regions called Rabbit's Eye, which taste better than sugar and honey and have no seeds, are different." But in addition to these names distinguished by color, there are also many unique names based on quality, such as Ouyu, Grass Dragon Pearl, Grandfather Leads Grandson, Rose Fragrance, and Mare's Teat Grapes. In addition, there is a kind of Suo Suo grapes produced in Tubo [Tibet], which are as small as peppercorns, contrasting with the egg-shaped grapes, which is a different kind of grape. The Complete Treatise on Agriculture also has a record of "Suo Suo Grapes," saying: "Suo Suo grapes are often eaten by children, which can prevent smallpox. It is also said that if the smallpox is not progressing well, eating them will bring it out." Unexpectedly, such a delicious fruit also has this medicinal effect.

As for the method of picking grapes to make raisins, in the past, people in the Shanxi area used to tie a bunch of fresh grapes with a rope and hang them in a dry, airtight house, and then light a ground fire stove in the house, so that the fresh grapes would gradually dry out. After about twenty days of baking, they could be taken down and stored. About four pounds of fresh grapes can be baked into one pound of raisins. The Essential Skills for the Common People also records a method of making grapes, saying: "Pick the extremely ripe ones one by one, cutting off the stems with a knife, being careful not to let the juice come out...boil them four or five times, strain them out and dry them in the shade, and they will be done. The taste is twice as good, and they will not spoil in the summer." This is another method of boiling.

Although grapes originated in Central Asia, Europe produces more than Asia. France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain are all countries that produce large quantities of grapes and wine. In Portugal alone, the vineyards occupy 35% of the country's area, meaning Portugal alone has 30,000 square kilometers of land that can produce grapes, equivalent to 33 and a half Shanghais. The amount of production can be imagined.

### Deep Impressions

— Zhang Guangyu

Ten years ago, in Qingdao, I went to visit an exhibition at the Sacred Heart Girls' Middle School, which was run by the church. On display there were exquisitely made clothes, trousers, and pillows, mouth-watering cakes and pastries, as well as calligraphy and paintings of various sizes and documents. As I left one exhibition room to step into another, I heard the sound of a piano coming from the next room. At that moment, an American teacher was sitting in the corridor. When she heard the sound, she immediately stood up solemnly. A minute later, she sat down again with a smile. I thought that the melody of the piano was probably very similar to the American national anthem, so when she heard it, she unconsciously stood up, and only when she listened carefully and found that it was not the national anthem did she sit down with a smile. I don't know if other visitors saw this scene and how they felt about it, but it gave me a deep impression.

Also ten years ago, also in Qingdao, I went to Zhongshan Park to see the cherry blossoms. As I looked at the trees one by one, I unconsciously approached the so-called "Monument to Loyal Souls." It was built by the Japanese to commemorate the soldiers who died when they seized Qingdao from the Germans. I was not very interested in this place, so I rarely came here. This time, lured by the cherry blossoms, I actually came, so I glanced at it. I saw only one young child in Japanese attire in front of the "Monument to Loyal Souls." I call him a young child because he looked no more than five or six years old. He may have been a kindergarten student, or maybe he hadn't even started school yet, but he was here alone. Did he run here from home by himself, or did he come here with his parents to see the cherry blossoms and then take the time to come here? I didn't know at all. I only saw him standing solemnly and bowing piously. There was no training director by his side, nor any parents, siblings, or relatives. He was paying his respects alone. I don't know if other visitors saw this scene and how they felt about it, but it gave me a deep impression.

### A Brief Discussion on Emperor Jianwen's Abdication

— Zhu Lixing

Emperor Jianwen reigned for only four years before being forced to abdicate and flee by the Prince of Yan, who possessed a large army. From then on, this emperor of a generation donned a cassock and lived a life of retreat in the southwest, spending his days with the sound of morning bells and evening drums.

After the Prince of Yan changed the era name and ascended the throne, he superficially issued decrees to strictly search for and arrest the abdicated and fleeing emperor, Emperor Jianwen, but in reality, this was all a measure to stir up the grass and startle the snake. If he were to actually arrest Emperor Jianwen, the Prince of Yan would find it difficult to deal with him. Kill him? He had seized the throne from someone else, and the fault lay with himself. What reason would he have to kill him? His conscience would not allow it, and it would be difficult to account for this case in history. Keep him? There was no second Ming Dynasty to place him in. A country cannot accommodate two rulers. How could they share the court? There was simply no way to keep him. Release him? Why capture him and then release him? It would be better not to capture him at all. Moreover, all the forces that Emperor Jianwen could employ had long been wiped out, leaving only a few followers, a group of insignificant officials who were not worth planning with. He simply didn't pay them any attention. Therefore, he deliberately let go of the indecisive Emperor Jianwen, who was powerless and harmless, and was confident that Emperor Jianwen had no power to take back the throne from him. Therefore, he did not uproot the tree after it had fallen, but instead relaxed and did not pursue the matter. I heave a sigh of relief for Emperor Jianwen. If the Prince of Yan had not planned this way at the time, he would never have escaped his clutches.

Since the imperial court did not insist on getting to the bottom of the matter, why would the officials need to add insult to injury? Moreover, there was justice in this matter, so why add another stroke to history: "On such and such a date, so and so captured the former Emperor Jianwen and presented him to the court." Therefore, Emperor Jianwen was able to travel freely in the southwest for thirty-nine years, and it was not without these reasons that he was able to live a carefree life.

During his twenty-nine years of secluded life, Emperor Jianwen visited many famous mountains and scenic spots. Because he loved to compose poetry, he would write poems whenever he climbed to a high place. Please see the following poems: When climbing Mount Emei, he wrote: "Climbing high, there is no need to crane my neck eastward, for I only see the clouds flying from my homeland." When climbing Zhangtai and mourning the past, he wrote: "Where are the songs of Chu and the dances of Zhao now? I only see the crows circling the trees, crying in the cold." And in his sentimental poem, he wrote: "Wasted in the southwest for forty autumns, my white hair is already full of my head. Heaven and earth are limited, where is my home? The Yangtze and Han rivers are heartless, their waters flowing on their own. In the Palace of Everlasting Life, the immortal energy has dissipated, and on the Chaoyuan Pavilion, the sound of rain is heard. New reeds and slender willows sprout every year, and the old villagers swallow their voices and weep endlessly!" And another poem scattered in various places: "Overnight, the wind and rain suddenly invaded, and the mandate of heaven shifted silently in the hearts of the four seas. The phoenix returned to Dan Mountain, and the red sun was far away. The dragon returned to the Canghai Sea, and the azure clouds were deep. In the Purple Palace, the stars still provide their images, and the jade clepsydra silently drips water. I imagine the moon over the Forbidden City tonight, and the six palaces still hope for your arrival." Another poem: "After reading the Surangama Sutra, I lean on the alms bowl and laugh at the thatched hut, a humble dwelling place. Traveling south, I crossed thousands of layers of misty mountains, and looking north, I gazed at the gates of heaven, ten thousand miles away. I have long forgotten the flying phoenix carriage, and I have exchanged the dragon robe for a cassock. Where do the hundred officials know where they are today? Only the archipelago offers morning and evening tribute." It is truly filled with grief and sorrow, which cannot but make people sigh deeply upon reading! An emperor of a generation! A poet of a generation!

### The Value of Studying Abroad

— Heting

On the eve of National Day, the Tsinghua Alumni Association held a farewell party for a friend who was going to study in the United States. During the banquet, many familiar friends discussed the value of studying abroad. Some raised the argument that studying abroad is a waste, while others expressed regret over studying abroad. Everyone was filled with many emotions!

There are roughly two reasons for opposing studying abroad: the first is what Mr. Hu Shih said, "a waste of foreign exchange." This is his opinion from an economic point of view, but the value of studying abroad is multifaceted, including increasing personal knowledge, promoting national spirit, communicating international culture, and promoting world cooperation. We cannot abandon it simply because of an economic reason.

The second reason is more easily believed, saying that studying abroad often leads to a disconnect from the reality of domestic society. Therefore, since the late Qing Dynasty sent students to study abroad, there have been no achievements to speak of. In fact, the inability of society to improve is a problem of the entire country and cannot be entirely blamed on students studying abroad. There are also students studying abroad who abandon themselves, such as a group of "foreign adults" in the late Qing Dynasty and corrupt officials in various institutions, but these cannot affect the value of studying abroad itself. Studying abroad is like running a university. Although there are many scoundrels and unfavorable phenomena in the university, we do not abolish the university for this reason. In all fairness, there are indeed many students studying abroad who serve the country, and today, those who shoulder the responsibility of national construction are mostly people who have studied abroad. The followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the National Revolution were all mainly students studying abroad. The Qing Dynasty's dispatch of students to study abroad had unexpected results. This can also serve as clear evidence of the multifaceted value of studying abroad.

From the perspective of education itself, the policy of studying abroad is only a means to achieve the goal of "academic independence." Adopting the advantages of others and enriching our own abilities is also in line with our country's spirit of "emulating the virtuous." Although inviting a few foreign scholars to give lectures in China can also develop effects, academic research is not just a matter of oral transmission. There are also various conditions of academic research atmosphere and social background, which cannot be achieved overnight. Looking further ahead, in the Han and Tang Dynasties, countries in the East and West sent students to study in China. This year, European countries also have exchange students with Chinese universities. Each country has its own cultural strengths, and academic exchange also has a moral responsibility. Our country's long-standing moral spirit is precisely what modern human peace needs. At that time, students from all over the world will come to China to study abroad, and we cannot regard earning foreign exchange as the goal of research. Therefore, the main question is how to improve the policy of studying abroad as soon as possible? Such as improving the academic level of students studying abroad, providing guidance for students studying abroad, facilitating the return of students studying abroad to serve the country, and making it possible for students studying abroad to develop their ambitions as much as possible. This is the work that is worth discussing today and that the government should implement quickly.

The world's culture is merging century by century. In today's international relations, which have not yet broken away from hostility, sending students to study abroad has a more active significance. For the sake of the entire world's culture and human peace, we should send more students to study abroad!

Note: Postal communication between China and Japan has long been restored. The Post Office has sent a letter to correct this.

### Miss America

Dancing Training of Miss America

Americans do not regard dancing as a form of entertainment, but as a form of etiquette and fitness. Because there are basically no professional dancers or women who make a living by ballroom dancing in the United States, dancing is not an extravagant and frivolous behavior in Europe and the United States, but a legitimate activity. This is a matter of opinion. If interpreted by someone with malicious intentions, they can attribute all the evils of society to dancers. In fact, dancers are a product of China's deformed society. If the Chinese government and the public advocate dancing, and everyone, regardless of age or gender, can dance, then the mystery of dancing and the attractiveness of dancers will naturally disappear. Who would still be captivated?

American women start practicing dance steps in dance schools from a young age, not to prepare for a future career as a dance hostess, but to exercise their bodies, develop curves, and beautiful legs. Where does the beauty of American women lie? In their legs, in their curves. This kind of beauty is not innate, but cultivated through exercise. Without hard work, one will never have a healthy and beautiful physique. Eastern women do not emphasize fitness. Women with bound feet and Lin Daiyu types are representative figures of Chinese women. In recent years, with the popularity of dancing, women have had the opportunity to develop, but they can never catch up with the well-proportioned bodies of Miss America.

American dance schools are generally very large in scale, with strict teaching methods that do not contain frivolous or sloppy elements. They charge four US dollars per hour, calculated from half an hour, and charge for each lesson, calculating the time accurately. Teaching is extremely serious. The schools have large dance floors with large glass mirrors on all sides. Stepping in front of the mirror helps correct posture. In addition to ballroom dancing, there are special classes teaching stage performance dance. This kind of dance requires four or five years of hard work to hope for success. The key points are the toes, waist, and legs. They practice diligently for three or four hours every day. After four or five years, they naturally become as light as a swallow, exhibiting utmost beauty, and then they can perform on stage. Dancing is an integral part of the daily life of American women. One cannot be considered a modern woman without knowing how to dance. The liberal arts colleges in universities have special dance departments. Upon completion of the course, they are awarded bachelor's, master's, and even doctoral degrees in dance. The academic world attaches great importance to dancing. When this art arrives in China, it is exploited as a tool for profit, thus arousing protests from stubborn elements who want to ban dancing (or perhaps ban commercial dance halls). This is a case of "throwing out the baby with the bathwater." The only good way to prevent dancing from being used for profit is to promote dancing, popularize it, and make it affordable, so that dance halls have no business and dancers have no patrons. Imagine, if everyone can take their girlfriends to the park to dance, who would still want to run into a dance hall?

Weekly Film Review

### ### Vulgar Adaptation of "Spring Dreams Broken"

"Spring Dreams Broken," adapted from Turgenev's "A Nest of Gentlefolk," is clearly not in the same league as the original work. Because the story as it is now adapted is both vulgar and devoid of people's sympathy. As a tragedy, the protagonist lacks noble sentiments. The heroine, Li Lisha, relies solely on a little emotion from her childhood, and her love for Xian Zhuangyou is still blind. Love like that in the story, lacking a foundation and without common ideals, is merely a bubble of youthful passion. The character of Xian Zhuangyou is even more selfish and cruel, with nothing to love. Yet the playwright insists on creating this love tragedy, his intention being to earn the audience's tears. However, the playwright fundamentally does not understand the social causes that constitute a tragedy, and therefore can only write such a superficial story as it is now.

Because the content of the script determines the form of the performance, the director only pieced together a so-called tragic film in a disjointed manner. Among the actors, Liu Qiong is the worst. He always has the same old mannerisms. Li Hua performed somewhat better, while Shen Yang's musician was stiff and unnatural. Yu Ling's grandmother was quite good. Qiao Qi's Hong Jiaqi was the best actor in the entire film.

### ### "The False Woman" Is Utterly Worthless

"The False Woman" is another work adapted from a foreign piece. The story is Balzac's "A Woman of Thirty." However, our playwright does not care whether the story is suitable for our national conditions, and simply moves it to our land based on the bizarre and tortuous plot. As a result, everything becomes a fictional story created by the playwright, far removed from reality. The absurd male protagonist, Fan Yalun, is written as a war hero, which is even more inappropriate. In short, this is a film that relies on gimmicks and is utterly worthless.

Fang Peilin's directorial technique can only manage to move the story and narrate it flatly, while also being full of loopholes. Among the actors, Gu Lanjun worked very hard, but without brilliance. Yan Hua was not excessive this time, and was indeed better than before.

### ### "Bitter Love" Is a Pieced-Together Story

The films of "Da Zhonghua" are generally of lower quality among domestic films, and this "Bitter Love" is no exception. The story itself is pieced together. The elopement of the heroine, Mei Mei, with Lu Sha, is in itself an absurd act. The love between their next generation, Haiyan and Lu Xuecheng, is nothing more than a copy of the old story in "Thunderstorm." In short, this script is plagiarized from Western films and stage plays, a clumsy "hotchpotch."

In terms of performance, Yi Qiuxia was quite able to grasp the character's personality, steady and experienced. Chen Juanjuan was also competent. Lu Yukun's two roles did not achieve better results.

The director of this film is entirely in the "Hong Kong style," sloppy and perfunctory.

### ### The Humorous Fantasy Film "Too Empty and Illusory"

The British have a consistent sense of humor and wit. This "Too Empty and Illusory" is a film depicting the human world and the dog days, and the author cleverly uses a hallucination caused by a brain injury of an air force pilot. The story develops on two sides simultaneously, and is written in a compact and interesting way. In terms of production, "human interrogation" uses five colors, and "heaven" uses a simple gray, which is very appropriate and indeed ingenious.

David Niven's Peter, the heroine Gantingde's Joan, and Roger Livesey's doctor all have quite excellent results.

### Seeking Information on the Mystery Ship Involved in a Maritime Accident

North of Banyao Reef Lighthouse on the Night of September 14th

Dear Editor: My poor fishermen's fishing boats were destroyed by a steamship, and fishermen were injured and killed, resulting in heavy losses. I hope to know the name of the ship. I especially request your newspaper to disclose the letter, and I will be eternally grateful!

We fishermen of Qushan, Dinghai, make a living by fishing. On the 28th day of the seventh lunar month, we launched fishing boats to fish on the sea about twenty miles north of the Banyao Reef (Xiaobaijiao) Lighthouse, hoping for a bountiful autumn catch. Who would have expected such an unexpected disaster? On the evening of September 14th (the 30th day of the seventh lunar month), around 10 pm, the tide was rising strongly. A crew member was working outside when he suddenly saw a steamship rushing towards them. He shouted urgently, "The steamship is going to collide!" The ship broke my fishing boat into two pieces, and crew members Zhou Pinde and Li Liangen were killed instantly. The ship also carried away the planks of another fishing boat. Amidst loud cries for help, the steamship went towards Shanghai.

At that time, another exporting steamship passed by the lighthouse, and perhaps it saw this tragedy. That night was as dark as pitch, and the surviving crew members were only concerned with escaping, so they did not clearly record the name and shape of the ship that caused the accident. Now I want to find a way to negotiate with the ship and seek guidance from the public after its disclosure. If there are any kind-hearted gentlemen who know the details, please inform me of the name of the ship involved in the accident, etc. Please send the letter to the Mao residence, No. 1, Lane 39, Chongqing South Road, Shanghai. I have always admired your newspaper's service to society and sympathy for the common people. Therefore, I venture to request that this letter be published, which is what I hope for. Sincerely, Hong Pinpin, a fisherman from Hengshan, Dinghai County, to the editorial department of Shen Bao.

Hui's classification method is slightly Wuchang, published by Wenhua Bookstore, written by Pi Gaopin, Chinese decimal classification method, correspondence address: Bai Zheng, No. 6, Songtong Lane, East Jihama Road, North Sichuan Road.

Job Seeking and Room Letting: The reader has been unemployed for quite some time, and I am deeply grateful for the corner of space used in the service column! "Now there is a Western-style building with a floor in the West Shanghai area, with full water and electricity, facing south. If you can introduce a driver or other job seeker, it can be rented out unconditionally. For those who are sincere, please send a letter to Zhou Zhang, No. 123, Fengyang Road. Ningbo native, 30 years old, has worked as a cashier in the banking industry, skilled in driving, has a license, and can provide a guarantor."
