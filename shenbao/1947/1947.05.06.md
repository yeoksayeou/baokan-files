### Lu Xi National Army Advances North on Multiple Routes, Recovers Wenshang, and Directly Points to Feicheng; Laiwu and Xintai Mountainous Areas Will Have Major Battles

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 5th] The Lu Xi battle situation has taken a sharp turn for the better. A certain elite unit of the National Army, with substantial strength, recovered Wenshang County on the afternoon of the 4th and then divided its forces to cross the Wen River to the north. With the speed of wind sweeping away fallen leaves, it continued its northward advance. The right-wing National Army is now directly pointing to Feicheng, and the left-wing National Army recovered Dongping at 2:00 PM on the 5th and is continuing its advance toward Dong'a. In addition, the National Army under Wang Yaowu, moving south from Changqing, will soon join forces with the National Army moving north. The Communist 5th and 10th Columns, and Liu Bocheng's 7th Column, totaling over 30,000 men, are currently scattered and fleeing within Lu Xi. They are like birds startled by the twang of a bow and should not be difficult to completely encircle and annihilate. On the Jinpu front, the National Army had already crossed north of Dawenkou, north of Nanliu, and was rapidly approaching Tai'an on the 4th.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 5th] After the main force of the Lu Communist Army retreated west of the Jinpu Railway back to the Yimeng Mountain area, they concentrated the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 9th, and 7th Columns, five columns in total, and gathered in the mountainous areas on both sides of the Mengyin-Qingtousi highway. The 1st and 3rd Columns were stationed north and south of Xintai, the 5th Column was stationed in Laiwu, the 10th Column was stationed in Zhangqiu and Mingxian, and the 6th Column was stationed in the mountainous area between Xintai and Sishui. Currently, Tai'an, Pingyin, Bacheng, Dong'a, and other places are all defended by local militia. The National Army is not concerned with the gain or loss of a single city or place but is concentrating its main force in the Yimeng Mountain area. Therefore, the truly decisive battles are now just beginning.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 5th] The National Army advancing toward the Culaishan area has already eliminated most of the Communist forces. The remnants of the Communist forces have collapsed and fled to Laihua, and the National Army is pursuing and sweeping up the area.

### Sun Liren Discusses the War Situation; Emphasis on Shanxi Province Battles

[United Press Beiping, 5th] The newly appointed Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Command, Sun Liren, flew to Nanjing today. He reportedly told reporters that the death of Communist General Lin Biao in Harbin has been confirmed. He also said that the National Army has no plans to attack Harbin.

[Agence France-Presse Beiping, 5th] General Sun Liren, the former commander of the New First Army, went to Nanjing today to report on his duties. Before leaving, he gave a speech stating that the Northeast Security Command has not received orders to occupy Harbin and that all military plans are currently being drafted by the central government. Important battles in various regions are being conducted based on special orders from the central government. The current war situation in the Northeast, except for Tonghua near the Korean border, is generally calm. He believes that the death of Lin Biao, the commander-in-chief of the Communist forces in the Northeast, has been confirmed and that he has now been succeeded by Lu Jingchao (transliteration). Of the battles on all fronts, the Communist offensive in Shanxi Province should be given "close attention." The strategy currently adopted by the Communist forces is similar to the situation when the Manchus entered the customs in the 17th century and established the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Manchus first occupied Shanxi Province, then acquired Shandong Province, which completely isolated Hebei Province.

### Communist Forces Fleeing Northern Anhui Surrounded

### Chen Yi Bids Farewell to Taiwanese Compatriots; Hopes They Will Raise Their Vigilance and Not Be Fooled; Xu Daolin and Others Depart for Taipei

[Central News Agency Taipei, 5th] Before handing over his duties and leaving Taiwan, Governor Chen Yi broadcasted to all compatriots in Taiwan for 20 minutes at 8:00 PM on the 5th. In his last broadcast, Chen made the following parting remarks: First: Taiwan is a territory of the Republic of China, with a mild climate and abundant products, and is an important military strategic base in the Pacific. At this time of turbulent international situation, it is inevitable that some ambitious elements will harbor covetous intentions and attempt to interfere. I hope all compatriots in the province will raise their vigilance, be cautious and fearful, and not be deceived or fooled by anyone. Any conspiracy to slander must be resolutely rejected. Second, I hope that all compatriots in the province will intensify their study of the national language and literature, understand the excellent culture of the motherland, and ensure that Taiwanese compatriots return to the original identity of citizens of the Republic of China. Third, Taiwanese compatriots have been under the harsh laws and severe punishments of the Japanese for the past 50 years, trembling with fear of violating the law. Therefore, many have a spirit of abiding by the law. However, this kind of law-abiding spirit is false and forced. Now the whole country is about to enter a new stage of democratic constitutionalism. I sincerely hope that Taiwanese compatriots will develop a spirit of abiding by the law spontaneously from now on. Fourth, Taiwan has been exploited by Japan for many years. On the surface, urban construction is still good, but in essence, rural life is extremely difficult. Since the recovery, we have tried to manage it in many ways. Most factories have started work, and farmers have also been able to cultivate to the best of their ability. The province has also been fortunate to avoid famine and has now passed the most difficult stage. I hope that all compatriots in the province will continue to work hard under the leadership of Chairman Wei, assist the government, and quickly complete the restoration work. Chen concluded by saying: "I came to Taiwan in October the year before last and it has been exactly a year and a half since then. I understand your advantages and weaknesses. Now that I am about to leave, I have specially stated the above parting remarks."

[Central News Agency Taipei, 4th] The newly appointed Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Xu Daolin, and the commissioners and directors of the departments will arrive today or tomorrow. The date of Wei Daoming's trip will be slightly delayed. It is heard that the Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters has been changed from the Central Garrison Headquarters to the Taiwan Provincial Garrison Command, and Lieutenant General Peng Mengji, Commander of the Kaohsiung Fortress, has been transferred to serve as its commander, and Commander Niu Xianming has been appointed as Chief of Staff. Peng arrived in Taipei from Kaohsiung yesterday morning. The market here is becoming more prosperous day by day. Tainan City has been the first to lift martial law since yesterday, but military police are still patrolling at night to prevent minor activities. A general household registration check was recently conducted in the Taipei urban area, and as a result, it was found that as many as 2,000 households and 7,800 people were unregistered.

Correction: In the report carried in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month about the arrest of Zhang Jinwu, editor of the North China Daily, the phrase "killed one person" was a mistake. According to a telegram from Beiping, it should be "killed one dog." We hereby correct this.

### Soviet Ambassador Visits Foreign Minister Wang; Gives a Concrete Reply on Receiving Lushun and Dalian; Gong Xuesui Arrives in Shenyang to Meet Xiong Shihui

### Northeast Communist Forces Divided into Two Factions; Surface Friction Between the Two Sides Becomes Apparent

[Central News Agency Changchun, 5th] The cadres of the Northeast Communist forces can be roughly divided into two factions: one is the cadres who went to Yan'an, who are mostly domineering and act arbitrarily when things happen; the other is the original local cadres, whose composition is complicated and who do not have a deep understanding of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the Yan'an cadres do not trust them, leading to mutual distrust. In recent days, this has become increasingly apparent.

### Completion of the Huayuankou Dam Restoration Project

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Huayuankou dam restoration project on the Yellow River, after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, was undertaken by the former Water Conservancy Commission, bringing together Chinese engineering experts with rich experience and engineers and experts from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China. It commenced between the autumn and winter of the 34th year [1945] and took nearly two years to complete. This arduous project has now been completed. The amount of materials used was enormous. According to preliminary estimates, it consumed a total of 120 million market catties of willow branches, 60 million market catties of sorghum stalks, 2.6 million market catties of rope, 800,000 cubic meters of soil, and 150,000 cubic meters of stone. The space occupied by the accumulation of these materials is considerable. Taking the willow branches and sorghum stalks alone, used to pave a road three feet high and six feet wide, it could stretch from Nanjing to Shanghai. The rope required would be enough to make a large, thick rope the size of a walnut, encircling the entire city of Nanjing 130 times. In addition, the consumption of stone and soil was also astonishing.

After the breach, the Yellow River was not dammed for several years and was allowed to change course several times, causing the Yellow River water to flow into the Huai River basin in large volumes. The lower reaches of the Huai River, passing through Xuzhou, had been seized by the Yellow River and silted up five years ago, blocking the outflow of the Huai River water. The low-lying areas of Anhui and Jiangsu were bound to suffer disasters every year, and the area of low-lying lakes and marshes increased year by year, while the bottom of the lakes rose every year. If repairs were delayed any longer, the Yellow River would not only swallow up the fertile land of Anhui and Jiangsu but would also threaten to flow into the Yangtze River through the Grand Canal. The entire water system of east-central China would be disrupted. Moreover, the Yellow River had been flooding in this area for seven or eight years, and it never broke through a waterway. It was only with the completion of the damming project today that the Yellow River water was guided back into its old course.

Construction Plan: The process of damming the breach was extremely arduous. There were repeated failures and dangers, but it was finally completed through the efforts of all the engineering personnel. Huayuankou was completely seized by the river, and the riverbed at the breach had silted up eight feet higher than before after eight years of sedimentation. The riverbed upstream of the breach had been scoured seven feet deeper. In winter and spring, the water level was already nine feet lower than the riverbed of the old course. When damming the breach, it was necessary to raise the water level by twelve feet in order to make the entire river flow back into its old course. Also, the soil at Huayuankou is extremely fine sand, which cannot withstand rapid currents. Therefore, the damming plan was not as simple as generally damming a breach. After research and design by experts, it was decided to use the method of a riprap platform. The western 337 zhang (a Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters) of the shallow beach of the 487 zhang wide Huayuankou breach was to be filled in using the method of layered encirclement. For the eastern part, where the water depth was three to fifteen feet (150 zhang), a stone bridge was to be built. Steel rails were laid on top, and large pieces of stone were thrown down under the bridge to form a stone dam, blocking the river and forcing it to return to its old course. Because the soil of the Yellow River is fine sand, a mat of woven willow branches was first laid under the bridge and downstream of the bridge site before the stones were thrown, so that they would not sink deeply into the mud and the riverbed downstream would not be scoured into a deep pit by the turbulent water. When the stone dam was thrown to a considerable height, the water level upstream would naturally rise. If the water flow over the top of the dam was too rapid, stone wrapped in willow branches would be bundled into large pillows two to three zhang long and thrown down, adding layer upon layer until the water returned to its old course. However, the stone dam made of stones and willow branches could still allow water to seep through. Sorghum stalks had to be bundled and inlaid on one side of the dam downstream, and then soil was filled between the stone dam and the side dam to seal it. A large dam was then erected behind the stone dam, making the stone dam a permanent revetment for the dike.

Construction Process: After the plan was decided, several model tests were conducted at the Chongqing Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory, and a large-scale field test was conducted in Changshou County, Sichuan. Then, in the autumn and winter of the 34th year [1945], preliminary work such as surveying and mapping was carried out first. The damming personnel and basic workers arrived at Huayuankou in January of the 35th year [1946], and construction officially began on March 1st. Later, due to various obstructions by the Chinese Communists, it was decided to divide the responsibilities for management after consultation. The same year, work began on all fronts. UNRRA also sent engineering consultant Todd, leading a dozen staff members, bringing a large amount of equipment to participate in the work. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) sent a working team to the construction site to distribute flour and handle sanitation matters. The Henan Provincial Government formed a recruitment and material procurement committee to recruit laborers and purchase reeds, willow branches, and toon wood. The Zhangde-Boye Section Engineering Office of the Ministry of Communications built a railway from Guangwu Station on the Pinghan Railway to Huayuankou. The Ping-Han Railway used a large number of trains to transport equipment and food. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission organized a damming and dike restoration engineering bureau to take charge of the construction. Under this concerted effort, the project proceeded very rapidly. There was a slight pause when the Chinese Communists requested a delay in damming. In the deep-water part, because the riverbed was very flat, the deepest point was only fifteen feet. The bridge construction work proceeded relatively smoothly. The 150-zhang-long bridge was completed on June 21st. Later, due to insufficient stone transport, the water rose on June 20th, and some bridges were washed away, making the project more difficult. Moreover, the water level rose daily from June to September, and the average flow rate was over 6,000 cubic meters, making it impossible to carry out the project. Work resumed on October 5th. After several failures, starting in November, willow branches wrapped in stone pillows were used instead. By December 25th, the deepest section of the river channel in the eastern part of the breach had been filled. At the same time, the five parallel tracks on the bridge had also been laid. The damming and throwing of stones began immediately. On December 27th, the water level upstream rose to three feet and six inches, and water release began. From January 11th to 15th of the 36th year [1947], the water level rose sharply. The water level difference between the upstream and downstream of the stone dam was six feet. Rescue efforts were intensified day and night, but it was too late. Some stone dams were washed away. It was necessary to widen one side of the stone dam by three zhang with willow branches to prevent the water flow from scouring. The top of the dam was filled with layers of willow and stone to raise the riverbed by six feet so that the water flow could not pass over the top of the dam. Also, because the old course of the diversion river was too small, four additional diversion rivers were opened up in addition to the original two, so that most of the river water would return to the old course during the closing process, reducing the impact force. Also, in order to make the Yellow River leave the breach and head straight for the old course, two drainage dams were built west of the west dam head. These projects were all completed on March 27th.

The breach was called "Golden Gate," and there were strong backflows on both the upper and lower sides of the breach, called "Golden Gate Occupations," which had to be particularly strong. Willow pillows and large iron wire cages were used to construct them. The willow pillows were pushed down from opposite sides of the two Golden Gate Occupations, which was the closing. This section of the project was completed on March 15th.

Because there were too many stones downstream of the main dam, and there were multiple leaks in the base of the dam and the Golden Gate, it was necessary to carry out sealing work. For the sealing work, another parallel side dam was inlaid upstream of the main dam, about six zhang away from it. Soil was filled between the side dam and the main dam to fill the leaking gaps with soil. This project was completed on April 20th. At this point, the arduous project of damming the Huayuankou breach and restoring the dikes on the Yellow River was completed.

### Minister Gu Tells Reporters: Principle of Unfreezing the Index Determined, Report on Shanghai Consultations Submitted to the Chairman

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] After returning to Nanjing on the 4th, Social Affairs Minister Gu reported the results of consultations with labor and management in Shanghai to Chairman Chiang and Executive Yuan President Zhang on the morning of the 5th. In the afternoon, he invited experts to discuss the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index. At 5:00 PM, he visited President Zhang again at the Executive Yuan to discuss this issue. Afterwards, reporters interviewed him, and he said: The issue of unfreezing the cost of living index has now been decided in principle. However, we are currently concerned about the impact of unfreezing, one being to stimulate prices and the other to stimulate foreign exchange. We are currently considering solutions and a decision can be made this month, and it will be discussed and decided by the Price Committee.

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] The Kuomintang Central Executive Committee today resolved to recommend to Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun to unfreeze the cost of living index, which is the first sign of a gradual easing of emergency economic measures. According to Kuomintang officials who spoke to United Press, the Central Executive Committee unanimously supported the early unfreezing of the cost of living index so that the new government could adjust the treatment of civil servants and soldiers. Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi attended the meeting today to report on the military situation and reiterated his belief that victory would ultimately be won in the war against the Communists, but he strongly advocated changing the treatment of American soldiers in order to boost morale. It is said that the current monthly salary of soldiers is only 20,000 yuan, which is not enough to buy six bowls of noodles at current prices.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] According to the Beiping cost of living index compiled by the Economics Department of Yenching University for late April, the total index for public school teachers and staff was 23,007 times, and the total index for workers' cost of living was 25,279 times.

### Hangzhou Rice Riot Subsides, Wuxi Sees Another Robbery Spree, Over a Thousand Shi of White Rice Robbed in One Day

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 5th] The Hangzhou rice riot has subsided. Grain merchants have accepted the government's post-riot arrangements. The entire city will resume business on the 6th, and the government will allocate 3,000 shi of public grain as a relief for resuming business. The authorities will immediately investigate the losses of the rice shops that were destroyed.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] At the Provincial Government's Memorial Week today, Deputy Director Wang of the Land and Food Department reported on the handling of the Hangzhou rice riot, saying that there were three reasons for the riot: (1) Grain prices in the production areas rose sharply in mid-March, but the assessed prices in the city were unwilling to follow, and the source ran out; (2) Grain prices in the areas surrounding Hangzhou rose sharply, and the city's limited prices were too low, resulting in a backflow phenomenon; (3) Grain merchants waited and watched, and citizens rushed to buy, resulting in supply not meeting demand and a sharp rise in the black market, leading to the destruction of rice shops. The source of the rationed grain includes 110,000 shi of civilian food rice purchased by the Bank of China on behalf of the government, 100,000 bags of grain allocated by the Department of Finance, and 10,000 shi of grain purchased, totaling 172,380 shi. The rationing method is: public school teachers and staff are allocated 8 dou per month, laborers 5 dou, and technicians 3 dou and 4 sheng, at a price of 117,000 yuan. Workers are allocated 2 dou and 4 sheng per month, at the same price. Impoverished households are allocated 2 sheng per day. Public school teachers and staff will start collecting grain today, impoverished households will be distributed within days, and workers are still waiting for the list to be cleared.

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 5th] Recently, grain prices in the county have been skyrocketing, and the black market has reached 300,000 yuan per shi.

No less than 1,000 people participated in the robbery. At about 10:00 AM, after the authorities ordered a large number of military police to the scene to suppress the riot, they dispersed. Four robbers, including Xun Yunfu, were arrested on the spot. All other rice shops were closed, and the situation was serious.

[Another Telegram] The rice robbery continued to occur this morning.

In total, more than 1,000 shi of white rice were robbed throughout the day. That evening, General Chen Daqing specially convened an emergency meeting of rice merchants and representatives of various agencies at the county government to discuss future measures. It was decided that the entire city would be supplied universally starting on the 6th, with white rice at 215,000 yuan per shi and indica rice at 180,000 yuan.

### Siam Announces Immigration Quotas: Chinese Nationals Limited to 10,000; Philippine Senate Decides to Postpone Discussion on Reducing Citizenship Quotas

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 4th] The new method of limiting immigrants to Siam (i.e., the quota system) has been officially announced and will be implemented from May 1st. Under this system, the number of foreign immigrants allowed into Siam is stipulated as follows: 10,000 for Chinese nationals and 200 for other nationalities. According to the announcement by the Siamese Ministry of Interior, these figures are only for the period from May 1st to the end of this year. The announcement did not specify whether the method will remain valid in subsequent years or will be subject to revision. According to the new system, foreigners entering Siam are divided into three categories: immigrants, non-immigrants, and non-quota immigrants. Under the following circumstances, foreigners entering Siam are considered non-immigrants: (1) those coming to Siam for business or travel, or for temporary reasons such as health; (2) those passing through Siam; (3) crew members temporarily berthed on ships in Siamese ports; (4) students. Non-quota immigrants include those working for the Siamese government in Siam, husbands of Siamese women, professors, religious workers, and those holding valid residency or re-entry permits issued by the Siamese authorities. Anyone not belonging to the above two categories and wishing to reside permanently in Siam will be regarded as an immigrant and will be treated as such. Non-immigrants entering Siam must pay 50 Siamese baht annually during their stay in Siam. Immigrants and non-quota immigrants pay an entry fee of 200 Siamese baht once upon entry at designated Siamese ports, and thereafter, they only need to renew their residence permits annually without further fees. There is no requirement for foreigners entering Siam to hold passports, as Siam has not yet established a consulate in China to issue passport visas; therefore, this method will at least temporarily apply to Chinese people.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 5th] Regarding the proposal by Philippine Senator Saludo to reduce the quota for foreign entry from 500 to 50 annually, it is reported that the Senate has decided to postpone discussions during its session.

At the same time, it is reported that the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee has also expressed opposition to Saludo's proposal.

### Postal and Remittance Workers Association Petitions Regarding Layoffs

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Postal and Remittance Workers Association is petitioning in Nanjing regarding the Postal and Remittance Bureau's large-scale dismissal of non-postal staff, leading to the closure of over 30 branch offices in various locations, but has received no results. The association held a reception for reporters on the 5th, requesting them to appeal on their behalf and persevere to the end. The bureau director's reasons for the layoffs are "overstaffing, requiring the dismissal of some personnel, and all non-postal staff should be subject to examination."

### Zhen'an County Bloodshed Case in Shaanxi Province: County Magistrate Was the Real Culprit

Provincial Assembly Resolves to Telegraph the Nation

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 5th] The truth about the Zhen'an County bloodshed case has not been fully disclosed by the authorities.

### Li Wanchun's Traitor Case: Hebei High Court Retries Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] After the case of famous actor Li Wanchun, accused of being a traitor, was sent back for retrial, the Hebei High Court held a public trial today. Li denied that his performance of the two plays "Ban Chao Joins the Army" and "Wu Song" on January 8, 1945, the anniversary of the puppet government in Nanjing joining the war, was intentional, but rather a coincidence.

### Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting: Business Leaders Besiege Price Controls; Public Opinion Resents and Rebukes as Impractical

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 5th] The difference of opinion between Hong Kong community leaders and the general public on major public issues can be demonstrated by the speeches at the annual meeting of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Gillespie of Butterfield & Swire, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, expressed support for the direct tax system and criticized the Department of Supplies, Trade and Industry. Mr. Gillespie pointed out that the indirect tax system forces even those in poorer circumstances to bear the tax burden, while the direct tax system is fairer. He criticized various measures of the Department of Supplies, such as trade and price controls, especially the Department's requisition of cloth and distribution to the public last year. He also criticized importers and middlemen for obtaining excessive profits. In reviewing Hong Kong's trade, Mr. Gillespie said that although the number of imported ships has recently increased sharply, it is still far from the pre-war record. Regarding the wage issue, Mr. Gillespie believed that under the current high cost of living, although the capitalists sympathize with the situation of the laborers, they also have to consider the difficulty that high wages will make it impossible for Hong Kong's prices to maintain balance with world prices. He estimated that wages and costs in the industrial sector have risen about four to five times compared to pre-war levels. Mr. Gillespie also stated that opening up "capital" to foreign trade is indeed necessary, and this matter has attracted the attention of the British Foreign Office and the Ministry of Commerce. Another business leader, Mr. Hanson, followed with a speech expressing the hope to restore Hong Kong's free enterprise system. This opinion has aroused resentment among the general public, who believe that trade and price control policies are the main factors in stabilizing life. Therefore, newspapers have criticized the aforementioned speeches as impractical. In fact, although the measures of the Hong Kong government's Department of Supplies inevitably infringe on the interests of the so-called business giants, at least they are still appropriate in terms of their effectiveness.

Finally, members voiced their opinions, and aerial entertainment was provided.

### Special Article: Looking Forward to Future Public Health Undertakings

— Yin Jiting

——Written for the Establishment of the Ministry of Health and the 7th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Medical Association

In the past six months, China's public health undertakings have undergone a major turning point. In early November last year, the Department of Health convened the National Public Health Administration Conference, which made important resolutions and measures regarding national public health administration. In May of this year, the government was reorganized, and the Department of Health was expanded into a ministry, indicating the authorities' emphasis on national health. On May 5th, the Chinese Medical Association convened its 7th annual meeting in the capital following the establishment of the Ministry of Health. The former oversees national public health administration, carrying out central laws and regulations and supervising and assisting local areas in promoting public health undertakings; the latter is the only academic organization in the domestic medical community, encompassing authoritative medical scholars in the country, who have made many contributions to the country in the past in terms of technology and administration. This is the first gathering after the victory, and at the time of the Department of Health's transformation into a ministry, it is bound to have more contributions and achievements. This is what we hope for and congratulate.

China's public health undertaking began with the establishment of the Ministry of Interior in the first year of the Republic of China. The President issued an order promulgating the official system of the Ministry of Interior, which established a Health Department within the Ministry of Interior to be in charge of public health administration, laying the foundation for China's public health undertaking. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the National Government promulgated the outline of the national public health administration system. On November 1st of that year, the Ministry of Health was officially established, becoming the highest institution for public health administration. Unfortunately, it was short-lived, and the Ministry of Health was reduced to a Health Department, which was subsequently changed to an Office. During the Anti-Japanese War, this system was maintained, and it survived the great national crisis. Although affected by the Anti-Japanese War and limited by talent and economy, it was still able to adhere to the principle of sharing weal and woe and make achievements in difficult circumstances. Now that it has been expanded into a ministry, it should make new actions and new achievements compared to the past.

However, China is vast and populous, education is not widespread, people's livelihoods are based on agriculture, economic production is backward, sanitary facilities are rudimentary, and in addition to years of war, the losses are huge. Public health undertakings are in a state of disrepair. I would like to list my humble opinions as follows:

1.  Resolutely Implement the Public Doctor System. The essence of the public doctor system is that the state should provide medical and health care and benefits to the people equally, regardless of poverty or wealth, or class. In other words, the government should socialize medical and health undertakings, transforming it from a system that resembles a transaction into a welfare facility of the state for the people. The state's possession of doctors is like the army and police. The army defends the country's territory and sovereignty, the police maintain social order, and doctors have the responsibility of protecting national health. Therefore, the essence of medicine is to apply benevolence to the art and save people from danger. China's rudimentary medical and health facilities and lack of talent are indeed the main reasons for the poor state of public health undertakings; however, given the abnormal state of Chinese society today, the private doctor system is prevalent, doctors gather in cities, open practices, and earn a living on their own, only seeking personal convenience and failing to coordinate with the needs of the entire nation. Moreover, the fees are high, preventing the general public from seeking medical care, which is a major obstacle to the popularization of medical care. The implementation of the public doctor system should be strictly managed, so that medical personnel are dispatched and conscripted, based on laws and regulations, and no different from the army. In implementing this system, it is especially important to increase the treatment of medical personnel and ensure occupational safety, so that they do not have to worry about life and can concentrate on their careers.

2.  Implement Planned Disease Prevention. Infectious diseases have been draining the national constitution of our country and harming economic production, as everyone knows. For several years, epidemics have been increasing rather than decreasing. Taking smallpox as an example, China invented vaccination to prevent smallpox at the earliest time. Today, it is still prevalent. New vaccination methods have only been around for more than a hundred years since Jenner's invention in 1796, and smallpox has almost disappeared in Western countries; while there are still many patients in our country. Smallpox immunization is 100% reliable; it is still difficult to eradicate, let alone diseases without absolute prevention. During the fall of Taiwan, infectious disease management was effective, and traditional Chinese medicine disappeared. With the victory, infectious diseases also recovered, and cholera attacked, causing many deaths, and traditional Chinese medicine became prevalent again. This fully proves the incompetence of China's public health practitioners. Why is it safe and sound in the hands of foreign nations, and the quality changes immediately after being taken back? The problem of trachoma is all over every corner of our country: During the war, an examination of Chongqing citizens showed that more than 80% suffered from trachoma, and at least one out of every three blind people was blinded by trachoma. How many people were blinded by trachoma and lost their sight. In addition, endemic diseases are a serious problem affecting the national health of our country: Kala-azar in North China, schistosomiasis in the Yangtze River basin, malaria in the southwest, etc., have been spreading for years, causing a high mortality rate. Other acute infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and diphtheria, the losses caused by the prevalence of rampant diseases are countless. Therefore, China's disease prevention undertaking is urgent and cannot be delayed. It is necessary to improve planning and investigation, and effectively prevent and control diseases according to the actual needs of disease prevalence. In addition to a sound disease prevention institution in the center, local disease prevention undertakings are close to the people, easy to understand the epidemic situation, and directly eliminate them, and should not be omitted. Central and local governments should work together to gradually eliminate infectious diseases.

3.  Develop Local Medical and Pharmaceutical Undertakings. Local areas are closely related to the people. Medical undertakings should be more developed. National facilities have not yet been popularized. Several provinces and regions have large areas, but there are no provincial hospitals established, and people's medical care is extremely difficult. Although there are only provincial hospital institutions, the area is too large and the population is too large, which is of no practical help. The facilities of provincial hospitals should be established in proportion to the population of the area. A relatively large-scale provincial hospital should be established in each administrative region of a province. As for the county health centers in our country, they are even rarer. Those that already exist are pitifully simple due to financial difficulties and lack of talent. In the future, funding should be increased, treatment should be improved, each county should have health center facilities, and branches should be established according to the area of the county. Local public health undertakings can not only provide medical treatment for people's diseases, but also carry out health education, instill health knowledge, break superstitions, reduce unnecessary waste, and also carry out disease prevention work. The relationship to the entire public health undertaking is very important.

4.  Implement Drug Management. Drugs are the main part of public health undertakings. China's industry is backward, and most new drugs rely on foreign imports, causing speculative drug dealers to raise prices arbitrarily; or shoddy products are created in various ways, making them difficult to identify. Not only are the poor unable to afford to buy them, but they often spend money without effect, and in severe cases, they may even get sick as a result. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to manage drugs and implement state-owned enterprises. Drugs should not be sold without a doctor's prescription. Health agencies can also sell drugs, but they must be limited to government-set prices and must not raise prices arbitrarily. In this way, the uncontrolled sale of drugs can be avoided, and the rich and the poor can get practical benefits.

There are many aspects of China's public health undertakings that need to be developed. The above are just the most urgent and important ones. At this time when medical professionals from all over the country are gathered together in the capital, we hope that the convening of this conference will have fruitful achievements and great gains. National health and the future of the country all depend on it?

### Five Communist Cabinet Members Forced to Resign: French Political Situation Enters New Stage; Prime Minister Ramadier Decides to Continue Governing; French People Must Strictly Observe Discipline to Overcome Difficulties

[Our Newspaper] Paris Broadcast on the 5th: France begins its "greatest duel" against the Communists today. After dismissing five Communist ministers last night, Prime Minister Ramadier convened a joint cabinet meeting today, with the Communist Party also attending.

[United Press, Paris, 4th] Ramadier's coalition cabinet, with a lifespan of only three months, expelled five Communist cabinet members from the cabinet last night. Prior to this, the parliament voted two to one to express confidence in the government's plan, and the Communist Party members voted against it. The five Communist officials who left office were Deputy Prime Minister Thorez, Minister of National Defense Billoux, Minister of Construction Dillion, Minister of Labor Croizat, and Minister of Public Health Marqui. Four of the ministers have been temporarily replaced by others. De Tay of the Popular Republican Movement is acting as Deputy Prime Minister, Tel Boss of the Left-Wing Union is acting as Minister of National Defense, Gauss De of the Popular Republican Movement is acting as Minister of Labor, and Moch of the Socialist Party is acting as Minister of Construction. After this partial reorganization of the Ramadier cabinet, it now includes members of the Socialist Party, Popular Republican Movement, Radical Socialist Party, and two non-party members. A cabinet spokesman said that Ramadier does not intend to submit a list of the reorganized cabinet for parliamentary approval, so the parliament will not reconvene before the regular meeting on the 6th. The next meeting will discuss the Madagascar riots.

[United Press, Paris, 4th] The Socialist Party's relationship to this political storm is quite subtle. The parliament voted 360 to 186 in favor of Ramadier's wage freeze policy, with Communist Party members voting against it and 63 members abstaining. Afterwards, the Socialist Party cadres held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. The vote resulted in 12 to 9 in favor of Prime Minister Ramadier's cabinet resigning completely. Socialist leader Blum, who had long disagreed with the left-wing elements in the party, convened an emergency meeting of the party's members and delivered a passionate speech, strenuously advocating the exclusion of the Communist Party. The final vote was 56 to 9, overturning the party cadres' decision and advocating that Ramadier remain in office and asking the Communist Party members to withdraw from the cabinet. At that time, the situation was chaotic. Many cabinet members, including the Communist Party members, went to the Prime Minister's office tonight to prepare to attend the meeting, only to learn that the meeting had been postponed. Communist Party leader Du said in the parliament: Whether the Communist Party remains in the government or implements withdrawal, it still considers itself to be a party of the government. It means that it may still support the government outside the cabinet. The Socialist Party leader, seeing the direction of the wind, decided not to have the Communist Party and try to govern alone.

[Associated Press, Paris, 4th] Political figures here predict that after the Communist Party withdraws from the government, it may plunge France into chaos and revolution, because the Communist Party can control the trade unions. After being in the opposition, it will inevitably cause labor unrest and paralyze France.

[French News Agency, Paris, 4th] France will encounter various difficulties in the next two months, mainly difficulties in food and currency. France must strictly observe discipline in order to overcome these difficulties. Changing prices and raising wages will destroy the currency system, and destroying the currency system is equivalent to destroying the working class. Another issue is the issue of the parliamentary system. The parliamentary system can be viewed in two aspects. First, there is a contract between the Prime Minister and the parliament, which all government officials should respect, otherwise there will be no parliamentary system to speak of; second, any cabinet member must be bound by the principle of cabinet unity.

### US Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan: House of Representatives Has Begun Final Debate; Decision Made Will Have Major Historical Significance

[United Press, Washington, 5th] The US government's proposal to provide $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey, the House of Representatives launched the final debate today, it has a great relationship with the formation of history. Members of the House of Representatives will find an answer to a question, that is, will this case promote peace or will it cause war. Only time can give a definite answer to this question. However, the House of Representatives has encountered two paths as a result, one is to take action now to curb the spread of communism, and the other is to wait and see whether the United States and the Soviet Union can reconcile the differences in their lifestyles. Which way to go must be decided now. After 22 days of debate, the Senate has passed the bill by a vote of 67 to 23, deciding to take action now.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] On the eve of the House of Representatives' discussion of the bill to aid Greece and Turkey in preventing communism, the government's foreign policy today encountered triple threats. The seriousness of this kind of domestic front challenging Secretary of State Marshall is only seen since the end of the war. The three threats are as follows: (1) Republicans in the House of Representatives have great differences of opinion on the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey. It is now planned to suggest that this matter be submitted to the United Nations for handling, and a part of the Democrats are behind it. (2) The Senate has also disputed the government's proposed $350 million foreign relief plan. The House of Representatives has reduced the amount to $200 million. (3) The House of Representatives' Expenditure Committee is rumored to recommend canceling the funding for the State Department's propaganda and cultural departments, including the "Voice of America" radio station. Marshall is prepared to meet this challenge, and his method is to first restore propaganda funding, believing that propaganda is essential for gaining understanding of American foreign policy from foreign people. He has invited 21 congressional leaders, all major decision-makers in finance, diplomacy, and transportation, to hold an extraordinary meeting with radio industry leaders tomorrow. In order to comply with President Truman's and the bipartisan policy, members of both the Republican and Democratic parties have been invited to the meeting.

### English and American Newspaper Commentary - French Political Turmoil

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Today's newspapers here have all published articles detailing the political turmoil in France. "The Times" emphasized that regardless of the outcome of negotiations by the country's leaders, France is likely to enter a new historical phase. It stated briefly: This French political turmoil is not merely a conflict, but will actually have a decisive impact on the future politics of France. Now, the coalition government seems to be in danger of decline. It is hoped that France can manage itself well, but in the current stalemate, the only one who can rise to the occasion is likely to be Charles de Gaulle. "The Daily Telegraph" was even more frank, believing that the division during yesterday's vote of confidence created a new opportunity for de Gaulle, and that France's urgent task today should be to unite the people and seek economic recovery in order to restore France's past international standing.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 4th] "The New York Times" stated in today's editorial that the French Communist Party's attempt to provoke a cabinet crisis to overthrow the current government proves that they not only want to demonstrate their power in France, but also throughout Western Europe. French Foreign Minister Bidault's previous expression in Moscow of a desire to align with Western countries angered the French Communist Party. Furthermore, the French Communist Party may also be alarmed by Truman's policies and the de Gaulle movement. In short, the overall situation in France is serious, and the Communist Party is the country's only major party.

### Japanese Cabinet Postpones Resignation - Parties Actively Preparing to Form a Coalition Cabinet

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] The general meeting of members of both houses of parliament belonging to the Socialist Party was held on the 4th. First, Chairman Katayama delivered a speech stating that since the Socialist Party now stands in the position of the largest party, it should bear the great responsibility of solving all national difficulties and national crises. Next, Secretary-General Nishio stated: Although the Socialist Party has not obtained a majority of seats in the parliament, if it gains the support of the people, it will not be difficult for our party to obtain the prime ministership and form a cabinet. In fact, those who advocate a coalition cabinet are not only the Liberal and Democratic parties, but also the working masses and business people. Our party should strive to form a coalition cabinet. Many people subsequently spoke on the political situation, and the results all agreed that Chairman Katayama should be the prime minister, and the policies should implement the Socialist Party's original policies.

### Reports of Soviet Military Exercises in the Bering Strait - The US Prepares for a Second Arctic Zone Maneuver

[United Press, London, blank Day] British Broadcasting Corporation broadcasted news that the Soviet Army has held spring exercises on the northeastern coast of Siberia across the Bering Strait from Alaska. The number of army participants is 250,000. Later, the Soviet Pacific Fleet and the Mongolian People's Republic Army will also participate. According to Swiss anti-communist broadcasts, there is often news about Soviet movements, but it cannot be investigated elsewhere, so it may be inaccurate. Some people also express doubts about the number of people involved in the exercises, because it is difficult to maintain the actions and supplies of such a large number of people on the northeastern coast of Siberia.

If both houses of Congress agree, the "Voice of America" ​​broadcast, whose main purpose is to target the Soviet Union, will end.

According to the US delegation, a decision cannot be made until the wording of the compromise plan is carefully reviewed.

[Associated Press, New York, 4th] The US delegation said today that the United States will propose that the Palestine Investigation Committee be organized by neutral small countries, and that neither the five powers nor Arab representatives should participate. This proposal is bound to arouse fierce opposition from Soviet representative Gromyko and the Arab side.

### Hengshan Road Destroys Rice Shop - Residents' Rice-Buying Emotions Agitated, Shop Owner Brandished a Gun to Demonstrate, Almost Causing Trouble

Around 12 noon, the crowd crowded in, destroying rice boxes, doors and windows, etc. Then, the shop owner Gong Wenqi pulled out a self-provided pistol (Japanese Type 14 automatic, gun number 30732) and raised it to demonstrate, almost causing trouble. Fortunately, the Tongren Street Police Station of the Xujiahui Police Branch sent personnel to the scene after receiving a report and detained the shop owner and three people from the crowd. According to Wen Qi, the rice arrived that night, and it was already late. By the next morning, because there were too many people, it was impossible to sell it. Those people actually relied on the crowd to come in and rob the rice through the back door. As a result, the row doors, board doors, glass windows, and rice boxes were all destroyed, and about eight or nine dou of white rice were robbed. Seeing the menacing situation, I had no choice but to show the pistol. After interrogating the three detained people, (1) Huang Derong said: 30 years old, from Yancheng, a rickshaw puller, lives at 53 Xinmin New Village, Tongren Street. At 7 am this morning, he held a rice-washing basket to buy rice.

### Father and Daughter Suspected of Being Traitors - Accused of Having Served in Puppet Positions in Beiqiao - Two Prisoners Held in Custody Were Subpoenaed to Testify - Hu Jie, Who Once Served as an Enemy Agent, Was Tried at the Same Time

[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Wang Youge, Wang Yongzhi, and Hu Jie (ie Wu Yuansheng) being suspected of being traitors was tried in the High Court yesterday. Wang Youge is a woman, living in Niuqiao Lane, Beijie, Minhang Town, Shanghai County. She is on the run. She was accused of being trained in the first blockade class of the Puppet Shanghai Qingxiang Cadre Training Institute in 1931. After graduating, she successively served as a female interrogator in the Puppet Beiqiao Special District Blockade Management Office, Huibiao Major Interrogation Office, and the Puppet Fengxian Special District Blockade Management Office and Guan'an Major Interrogation Office. Her father, Wang Yongzhi, was accused of serving as a counselor in the Puppet Beiqiao Special District Office. At that time, he planned tax revenue matters on behalf of Zhu Nizi Zhongxian, the puppet district chief. The fact that his daughter Wang Youge was sent to the Puppet Cadre Training Institute for training was the defendant's request to Zhu Nizi Zhongxian to recommend her. Hu Jie was accused of serving as a secret agent of the Japanese Navy Marine Corps in Hongkou in 1938, serving as a clerk in the Puppet 76th Special Agent Headquarters in 1933, and serving as a lieutenant adjutant in the Puppet Shenjiang County Security Corps in 1934. Only the defendant Wang Yongzhi was summoned yesterday. He claimed that he had never held a puppet position. His daughter Wang Youge's departure was due to free love. Her enrollment in the Qingxiang Cadre Training Institute was not the defendant's intention. Later, the imprisoned traitorous prisoners Fan Cunzheng and Cheng Miao were summoned to testify that the defendant had held a puppet position, but they did not know whether he had committed any acts detrimental to the people. Finally, the defendant's defense lawyer, Yu Luo, requested the court to write to the Shanghai County Government for investigation. The court adjourned the debate and retrial was scheduled. The defendant was still released on bail.

[This Newspaper Dispatch] In the case of Wang Zhuchen concealing assets of the enemy 長島洋行 , Teng Yongxi, the former deputy director of the Putuo Road Police Precinct, was indicted for allegedly concealing stolen goods on behalf of Wang. The District Court's Criminal Division reopened the trial yesterday and summoned Fan Rongchun, Director of the Central Machinery Factory, as well as employees Gu Dingyi, Zhou Lanlan, and Liu Zhonglian, and Wang Zhuchen to testify. According to the testimony, he had a teacher-student relationship with Wang's brother-in-law, Yu Qingjian. Yu claimed that he had bid for automobile materials in Hongkou and asked for help in storing them, so he introduced them to the Central Machinery Factory on Jiangning Road for storage. He stated that Jiangning Road was not under his jurisdiction and that it was entirely a private favor to Fan, not an abuse of power. Furthermore, he continuously sent letters to Fan after the incident, stating that if the stored items were indeed enemy assets, he would not evade responsibility. He also stated that the case had been delayed for four months and requested a speedy conclusion. Witnesses Fan and Gu still stated that they only discovered the situation after seeing it reported in the newspapers and reported it to the authorities. Their testimonies were largely the same as in the previous two court sessions. The court considered the presence or absence of the words "長島洋行" on the wooden boxes storing automobile materials to be crucial evidence and ordered the bailiffs to accompany Fan and Gu to investigate on the spot. The case will be scheduled for another trial at a later date.

According to the defendant Fang Junde, on June 21st of last year, the Huangzaoji Shipyard was fined 2 million yuan for obstructing the waterway while salvaging a sunken ship in the Huangpu River. The funds were placed in a silver box, but due to being busy with other matters, they were not handed over. He stated that this was negligence in his duties, not corruption. The court also inquired as to why eight of the fine receipts had been torn up. Fang could not answer but claimed to have found four of them. Huang Jiangren (manager of Huangzaoji), the witness, stated that the fine was paid to the officer on duty based on Fang Junzhi's note and that a receipt was obtained. He knew nothing else. Wei Benshuo, the deputy commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, stated that the police chief had no power to impose fines; only the harbor master could impose fines on violations, so Fang's actions were illegal profiteering. The court determined that the case still required further investigation of evidence and scheduled another hearing for May 14.

A man named Zhang Shihuang, who calls himself "Modern Wu Xun," came east from Chongqing last year, using the pretext of preparing for the "Thousand Buddha University" to issue declarations and solicit donations everywhere.

### A Unique Robbery Case Solved After Half a Year of Investigation

[This Newspaper Dispatch] Last November, a unique robbery case occurred in the city. The culprit, Li Kaihua (38 years old, from Jiaxing), saw an advertisement for the transfer of an empty house at No. 27 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road. He conspired with five accomplices: Yang Xiaodi, Leng Kunyuan, Wu Wenxiang, and two surnamed He and Wang, to fraudulently obtain goods by pretending to rent the house.

At the time, Li used the alias Chen Xinyuan and pre-printed business cards of the manager of Xinyuan Silk and Cloth Store. He contacted Mrs. Lu, the original resident of the above address, and agreed to transfer the house for 95 taels of gold. On the spot, he issued a bad check for 12 million yuan dated November 22nd from the Xinchun Qianzhuang. On November 21st, Li led five accomplices disguised as small workers, pretending to decorate the room, and waited there first. At the same time, Li went out to buy two gray-backed coats from Tianfaxiang Fur Store on Henan Road, a large quantity of 桃奎寗 and other Western medicines from Zhongmao Pharmacy on Guangxi Road, ten pieces of woolen cloth from China Woolen Company on Nanjing Road, and three rings and a red gold bracelet from Fang Tianbao Silver Store on Nanjing Road, totaling 21.128 million yuan at the time. All of these were given to Li with the above business cards (at which time the business cards were already printed with the address: No. 27, Lane 224, Xinzha Road, telephone 37056), instructing them to deliver the goods and pay after 4:00 PM on the same day. When the staff members of each store arrived to deliver the goods, Li and others showed their pistols, seized the goods, and drove them into the pavilion room of the house, until all the goods arrived before escaping with the loot. After the incident, the police bureau dispatched officers to investigate, but due to the secretive whereabouts of the criminals, the case could not be solved. It was not until last month that Feng Qishan, the section chief of the Detective Section, received a report that the main criminal, Li Kaihua, was hiding in Jiaxing. After requesting instructions from his superiors, he led section member Feng Xiushan, officers Guo Yuping, Zhang Changgui, Zhang Jianyun, and Fang Tianbao Silver Store employee (Li Shilong, etc.) to go there. However, the criminal had already come to Shanghai, so they tracked him to his Shanghai residence at No. 35, Wuxingqiao, Jumen Road, and finally captured him. After interrogation, he confessed without hesitation and was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation yesterday.

Tong Jianyi asks: I am naturally weak. Last summer, I suffered from scrofula of the neck, followed by Sha disease. After being given acupuncture by a Chinese medicine practitioner, I felt slight pain in my lower abdomen from time to time. Later, due to overwork, my right testicle became hard and enlarged, and painful. I would like to ask: (1) What is this disease? What is the cause? How can it be treated? (2) What medicine should I take for self-treatment? Is taking cod liver oil effective? (3) I have eczema on my scrotum. Is it related to this condition? (4) What foods should I avoid?

[Answer by Dr. Zhang Zhongming] (1) This is orchitis. Whether it is spermatocytic or inflammatory after acupuncture needs to be determined after examination. (2) Apply Antiphrogestin topically. Take Sulfadiazine anti-inflammatory tablets internally. Cod liver oil is very suitable for scrofula of the neck and tuberculous orchitis. (3) For scrotal eczema, apply 3% salicylic acid ointment or solution. (4) Avoid irritating foods and strenuous exercise.

(2) Loss of Hearing in Both Ears

Yang Aiping asks: My mother is 45 years old. She lost her hearing in both ears in the summer of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. Because she lives in a remote village, she did not seek medical treatment. She has not recovered until now. I don't know what the cause is and how to treat it.

[Answer by Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your mother's deafness is probably caused by nerve weakness due to old age. It is advisable to take vitamin B or phosphorus compounds to supplement it. At the same time, a local examination should be done to see if there are other obstacles.

### Educational Experts in the Capital Hold a Meeting to Discuss Improving University Education. The Main Topic is: Elaborating on the Selection of School Administrators and Principals. Concrete Plans Will be Proposed to the Authorities After Completion.

[Report from Nanjing, May 5th, by this newspaper] The symposium of educational experts in the capital was held at National Chengchi University at 3 pm on the 4th. More than 20 people including Cheng Shifan and Cheng Qibao attended. Wang Jingqing chaired the meeting and discussed: "How to stabilize university education to achieve its mission through improving university administration." The following points were generally agreed upon: (1) Currently, university administration is concentrated on the principal alone, and even trivial matters must be managed, preventing them from focusing on leading academic research. It is advisable to change to a "unified teaching and discipline system." "Teaching affairs and moral education" should be managed by the departments of each college. If necessary, a vice-principal can be set up to take charge of school affairs, so that the principal can preside over school administration, lead academic research, and improve educational efficiency. (2) Regarding the selection of principals, it is best to restore the system of selecting and hiring by the university committee during the Cai Yuanpei era, because this system is very effective in France. Even if national universities cannot set up a board of directors like private universities, the government can hire virtuous and capable people from society to form a guidance organization to assist in the process. (3) The appointment and dismissal of university teachers should be decided by the school's appointment committee. (4) For each course, reduce the number of required courses as much as possible and increase the scope of electives. (5) With the implementation of constitutional government, activities of various political parties in universities are inevitable. Students' freedom of thought and speech in schools should not be harmed. Those who disrupt school order and use it as a tool for political struggle should be severely punished. (6) At present, prices are soaring and teachers' lives are difficult. It is urgent to improve the salary standards of professors. The highest should reach 680 yuan, which is equivalent to the legislators and supervisors, so that academic talents will not be drawn into politics. The payment of salaries should be based on the price index. (7) The research equipment of public and private universities should be enriched. The educational administration authorities should overcome budgetary difficulties and take effective measures to stabilize the lives of university professors. The experts present also formed groups to study concrete plans, which will be submitted to the next meeting for approval and recommendations to the educational administration authorities for improvement.

### Students from Three Universities in the Capital Request Exemption from the Comprehensive Graduation Examination

In his speech, Mr. Yu Youren said that he came to Shanghai to attend Alumni Day and did not know in advance that the alumni were celebrating his birthday, repeatedly saying "I dare not." Mr. Yu recalled the process of Ma Xiangbo founding Fudan University and his personal hard work and struggle in his youth, and his involvement in the revolution, which moved everyone who heard it. Mr. Yu concluded by saying that he only hoped that God would grant him years, and vowed to contribute to the construction of a new country based on the Three People's Principles with all the alumni, and encouraged the alumni to continue to seek development and learning in hardship. After Mr. Yu's speech, the whole audience applauded. Then the old president Li Denghui gave a speech.

### Wuben Students Petitioned Yesterday, Appealing to the Municipal Government and Council About the Disturbance of the Students of the Municipal Teachers College, Requesting a Thorough Investigation of the Responsibility for the Incident and Guaranteeing Future Safety.

Since the classrooms of the Municipal Wuben Girls' High School were destroyed by the students of the affiliated high school of the Municipal Teachers College, the order has been disrupted and the school has been forced to suspend classes for more than four days. They requested the education authorities to punish the rioters, thoroughly investigate the responsibility for the incident, and guarantee future safety, but there has been no result. All the students were extremely angry and went to the Municipal Education Bureau to petition yesterday (5th) morning. Deputy Director Li received them and the students put forward four requests: (1) Quickly investigate the perpetrators and responsible persons. (2) Request the other party to provide a written guarantee that the same or similar incidents will not occur again and compensate for the damage. (3) Ensure the safety of the school. (4) Ensure that there is a complete and independent school building. Deputy Director Li promised to deal with it appropriately and advised the students to return to school and resume classes. The students felt that Deputy Director Li's reply was empty and expressed their dissatisfaction. In the afternoon, they went to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council to petition. In addition to the aforementioned four requests, they also detailed that the school has a long history. Since the restoration of the school, the school site has been relocated many times due to the lack of a fixed school building, and the students have suffered a lot. Last autumn, they moved to the current site and shared a school building with a boys' school. The students have been insulted by the neighboring school's boys more than once. This time, they were deeply saddened by the disturbance. Today, they are petitioning the administrative authorities and the public opinion organs, and they hope that all parties will uphold justice and urge the competent authorities to earnestly implement the students' requests. It is heard that the Municipal Government and the Council expressed their deep sympathy and promised to do their best to support them. They promised to thoroughly investigate the responsibility for the incident, rectify the school spirit, and find a way to designate an independent and complete school building so that they can study with peace of mind. The students of the school felt satisfied and returned to the school in formation. They can resume classes as soon as all the requests they have made are fully resolved.

### Mayor Wu Complies with Rice Merchants' Request: Free Trade in Rice Resumes

Citizens Can Purchase One Dou of Rice Every Half Month with Household Registration Certificates

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Rice price controls have been lifted, and free trade has been permitted to resume starting yesterday. Meanwhile, the Social Affairs Bureau continues to sell 9,000 bags daily to meet the needs of rice shops distributing to households based on registration, with the price remaining at 168,000.

Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, rice industry representatives Qu Zhenhua, Xu Songren, Cha Baosan, Hu Wenan, Cai Shengming, and others visited Mayor Wu at the City Hall. The head of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Ji Mingzhai, was also present. The rice merchant representatives detailed the actual difficulties caused by the rice controls and requested permission to resume free trade. After an hour of discussion, Mayor Wu finally decided to lift the price controls and allow free trade to resume, hoping that the rice merchants would exercise self-restraint to stabilize prices. The representatives guaranteed that after the resumption of free trade, they would not arbitrarily raise prices and would operate with conscience.

According to Qu Zhenhua, the rice shortage in the market is not due to a lack of supply. It is caused by public panic following the implementation of controls. Recently, more than one hundred rice boats from producing areas arrived in Shanghai, but they all flowed into the black market to avoid price controls, and were purchased in large quantities. Legitimate merchants were unable to purchase rice, leading to today's chaotic rice market situation. Now that free trade is permitted, and the city government continues to allocate rice at a price of 168,000 yuan, it is believed that public sentiment will stabilize.

When interviewed by reporters, Mayor Wu stated that after the resumption of free trade, the city government would continue to release 9,000 bags daily for allocation. The responsible authorities will publicly announce the daily quantity of rice released from the warehouse and the rice shops allocated, while also distributing the list to each police precinct and district office. The police precinct will dispatch personnel to supervise the rice shops' distribution in the same quantity with the district residents' representatives to prevent hoarding. Ordinary citizens can purchase one dou of rice from rice shops with their household registration certificates within a half-month period, limited to five dou per household. The purchase date and quantity must be written on the household registration certificate, and the rice shop must record and report it to the district office and police precinct daily. Those unwilling to purchase with a certificate or wishing to purchase more can obtain it from the free market.

Yesterday, a total of 2,687 shi of goods arrived in the northern and southern markets. There were also more than 5,000 shi of goods from Hexia. Rice merchant representatives voluntarily temporarily limited the transaction price of white japonica rice in the market to 240,000 yuan and the retail price to 250,000 yuan, but no one was willing to buy at that price. The rice shops, due to the small amount of allocated rice, had many citizens lining up to purchase, which easily caused disputes. Therefore, many were unwilling to register and sell the allocated rice yesterday.

### Flour and Cooking Oil Rise Sharply in Tandem

Yesterday, flour prices rose by more than 10,000 yuan, and imported flour jumped by nearly 20,000 yuan. Wheat bran was in great demand, surging by more than 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake transactions were brisk, rising by another 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybeans rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, and raw peanuts were actively traded, surging by more than 10,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were extremely popular, advancing by more than 10,000 yuan.

Red sorghum and corn alcohol continued to be popular, both increasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Broad beans were scarce and expensive, rapidly advancing by 10,000 yuan. Red beans were scarce in both supply and demand, temporarily unchanged. Mung beans remained firm.

The oil market was very bullish, soaring and rising sharply by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. All grains experienced a comprehensive price surge.

### Unified Bonds Slightly Retreat After Rising

Public bonds retreated slightly yesterday after rising. Unified C opened at 19,300 yuan in the morning, with a low of 18,600 yuan and a high of 21,500 yuan. At noon, it hovered around 19,500 yuan. Rooms 512 and 555 and Runde were buying, while rooms 550 and 503 and others were selling. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A, B, D, and E slightly declined by 200 to 300 yuan, while unified bonds slightly rose by 200 yuan, with a total transaction volume of approximately 12 million yuan.

### Foreign Stocks See High Prices with More Buying

Foreign stocks saw increased buying from foreign firms and money shops yesterday, aiming to maintain currency value. Ewo Silk rose steadily after opening at 80,000 and British American Tobacco at 118,000 yuan. It slightly fluctuated near noon. In the afternoon, Hong Kong exchange rates were favorable, continuing to see high prices. Ewo Silk reached 85,800 yuan and British American Tobacco reached 147,000 yuan, before slightly retreating. Banks showed an appetite for steel, while securities firms took profits after substantial gains. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British American Tobacco and Jardine Matheson rose by over 20%, while Ewo Silk, Ewo Brewery, shipping, steel, telephone, and Kailan Mining rose by over 10%. Plantations and rubber shares also saw strong gains.

### Sugar Market Tightens Again

Yesterday, the sugar market remained resilient due to the undecided date for Taikoo Sugar's resumption of allocation. Peruvian fine granulated sugar rebounded to 435,000 to 436,000 yuan, up by more than 10,000 yuan. No. 24 coarse white sugar remained unchanged, while wrapped sugar retreated by 20,000 yuan.

Shantou green sugar was at 270,000 yuan, Huangjiang green sugar was at 265,000 yuan, and Gaoshunde green sugar was at 265,000 to 260,000 yuan. Diaoqing sugar was at 255,000 to 240,000 yuan, slightly over 35,000 yuan. Zhongshan sliced green sugar was at 257,000 yuan, with higher quality. Xinghua white sugar was at 410,000 yuan, followed by 400,000 to 390,000 yuan. Xingchi red sugar was at 310,000 yuan, followed by 300,000 to 295,000 yuan.

### Tianjin Exports Show Improvement

[Reported by Our Newspaper from Tianjin, 5th] Tianjin's export situation is gradually becoming more active.

The import value was over 25.4 billion yuan, resulting in a trade surplus of over 19.2 billion yuan. The total export value increased by over 17.3 billion yuan compared to the previous month.

### Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to Hebei and Northeast; Registered Manufacturers Must Meet Three Qualifications

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Textile Control Committee has recently formulated (1) Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to Hebei and Northeast Ports and (2) Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Internal Transit Exports, based on the three measures for stabilizing yarn and cloth previously promulgated by the Executive Yuan. The former will be announced and implemented from today. The latter is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs before being announced and implemented.

According to Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Committee, the content of the measures for controlling yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast ports is generally the same as the measures for controlling yarn and cloth exports to the south. Registration procedures for manufacturers will begin tomorrow (the 6th). Manufacturers in this city are limited to applying for registration within one week. Manufacturers in other cities are limited to applying for registration within three weeks. Factories that have already registered and qualified in the yarn and cloth export to the south case do not need to apply for registration again, but they need to fill in a new seal card. All distributors need to apply for registration. Manufacturers applying for registration must meet the following three qualifications:

(1) Must be a member of the trade association; (2) Must be approved and registered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the local Social Affairs Bureau; (3) Must have previously engaged in this business. If it is a branch of a manufacturer in another city, the manufacturer must also possess the above qualifications.

Distributors must provide the following proof: (A) Business ledgers for yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast from January to March of this year; (B) Customs documents for yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast from January to March of this year, so that the Committee can determine the quota for approval.

The quota for yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast is determined with reference to the registered yarn and cloth import quantities of the customs in these areas in 1930, according to the ratio of the current domestic yarn and cloth production volume to the pre-war domestic yarn and cloth production volume, and considering the local supply and demand situation. It is stipulated that the monthly import of cotton yarn into Hebei and Northeast ports is 3,456 pieces and cotton cloth is 124,164 bolts. The Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to Hebei and Northeast Ports are transcribed as follows:

Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to Hebei and Northeast Ports:

(Article 1) The Textile Business Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) hereby formulates these simplified regulations in order to handle the management of yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast ports under orders.

(Article 2) Manufacturers who apply for the allocation of yarn and cloth to be exported to Hebei and Northeast ports must fill out a yarn and cloth export application form, have the type and quantity certified by the selling manufacturer, and submit it to the Committee or its designated affiliated agency for review.

(Article 3) The applicant manufacturer must be a member of the trade association, be approved and registered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the local Social Affairs Bureau, and have previously engaged in this business. If it is a branch of a manufacturer in another city, the manufacturer must also possess the above qualifications.

(Article 4) The monthly quantity of yarn and cloth allowed to be exported to Hebei and Northeast ports is determined with reference to the pre-war yarn and cloth import quantities of these areas, according to the ratio of the current domestic yarn and cloth production volume to the pre-war domestic yarn and cloth production volume, and considering the current supply and demand situation.

(Article 5) The monthly quantity of cotton yarn allowed to be exported is allocated by the Committee according to the number of spindles in each registered yarn factory. If a factory does not need to export its products in a certain month, its share of the export quantity will be withdrawn by the Committee and reallocated.

(Article 6) The monthly quantity of cotton cloth allowed to be exported is determined by the Committee based on the past transportation quantities of each registered distributor, the production situation of each textile printing and dyeing factory, and the market supply and demand situation, and quotas are allocated separately.

(Article 7) Manufacturers must declare and export within ten days from the date of obtaining the export license. The export license will be invalid if it expires. Export licenses shall not be transferred privately. If any violations occur, in addition to invalidating the license, all rights of the manufacturer will be revoked.

(Article 8) The application and licensing regulations for yarn and cloth exported to other parts of the country besides Hebei and Northeast ports are specified separately.

Article 9 These simplified regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

[Reported by Our Newspaper] It is reported that after the government controlled yarn and cloth exports to the south and north to Hebei and Northeast ports, there is still an insufficient amount of yarn and cloth to meet demand beyond the yarn and cloth quota. It has been directed that the China Textile Construction Company should find ways to transport and sell to supplement the needs of these areas.

### Chunlan Loans: Application Procedures Begin

The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry held a meeting the day before yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM and passed a resolution: If silk manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who received loans from the National Bank last year have fully repaid them before the end of last month and have qualified guarantees, they can apply for loans to purchase this year's spring silk. Starting yesterday, more than thirty manufacturers in this city have gone to the Committee to obtain application forms. The deadline is set for the 8th. The Committee also plans to formulate application loan standards, which will be announced today or tomorrow. The approved amount for each factory will be determined separately at a meeting convened by the Committee to ensure prudence.

### Chinese Stocks See Slight Movement in Retail Sales; Market Starts Weak but Strengthens Later

Although some Chinese stocks were sold off yesterday and there was some activity in retail sales, there was a sense of powerlessness to advance in the middle of the session. However, due to high reports from the Hong Kong market, the number of chips remained scarce. In addition to Meiya and other stocks hitting their daily limit, Yongsha also became firm at the end.

The market opened higher in the morning. Yongsha advanced after opening, with numbers 142, 169, 94, 232, 205, and 152 all advancing. Meiya first hit its daily limit due to the positive news of the shareholders' extraordinary meeting. Jinglun and Commerce also hit their daily limit. The number of chips was very scarce, and Yongsha rose to 6,540 yuan. Numbers 185, 12, and 218 took profits at the high and retreated to 6,460 yuan. Numbers 142 and 152 bought, rising to 6,558 yuan. Yongye also hit its daily limit. Numbers 105, 83, 97, and 85 sold off, retreating again to 6,500 yuan, after which it entered a long period of consolidation.

After 10:40 AM, due to news of the black market for gold banknotes rising and foreign stocks soaring, investor confidence began to revive. Numbers 89, 99, 14, 36, 76, and 197 all advanced, and Yongsha rose to 6,640 yuan. Numbers 33, 191, 179, 129, 154, and 231 sold at the high, especially number 129, which was the most active buyer, dropping back to 6,480 yuan. Numbers 112, 89, 145, 77, 153, 76, and 224 advanced, investor confidence was stable, and cement also hit its daily limit. Near noon, Yongsha rose again to over 6,600 yuan, but number 129 still sold off.

At noon, it hovered around 6,550 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Huafeng was flat, Yongsha and Jingfu rose by half a percent, Xinguang, Qinxing, Zhongfa, and Xinhua rose slightly, Xinho and Yonggong rose by one percent, and Meiya hit its daily limit. In terms of delivery, Huafeng was flat, Meiya hit its daily limit, and Yongsha, Xinho, Yonggong, Jingfu, and Qinxing each rose by a little over half a percent.

Among the cold stocks, cement and commerce rose to the limit, and Xinya, Zhongs, Jinglun, and Rongfeng retreated after hitting the limit. Matches and Tongyi each rose by slightly less than one percent, and the remaining stocks also rose by around half a percent.

In the afternoon, news of a strong Hong Kong black market spread, and numbers 219, 94, 12, 232, and 82 all advanced. Zhongs, Meiya, Commerce, Cement, and Xinya all hit their daily limit. Yongsha rose to 6,670 yuan, and numbers 71, 91, 224, and 36 sold at the high, retreating to 6,530 yuan. Numbers 76 and 4 advanced to 6,600 yuan, but numbers 215, 36, and 85 were still selling, falling back to around 6,520 yuan. Numbers 106, 95, 218, 35, 145, 16, and 152 bought in one after another, closing at a high price of 6,700 yuan.

After closing, numbers 223, 152, and 237 all supplemented their positions, and the final bid was as high as around 6,780 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Meiya hit its daily limit, Yongsha, Xinho, and Yonggong Jingfu rose by about 10%, Xinhua and Qinxing and Xinguang each rose by half a percent, Zhongfa rose slightly, and Huafeng was the only one that was flat. In terms of delivery, Meiya hit its daily limit, Yongsha, Xinho, and Yonggong rose by about 10%, Huafeng was flat, and Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing each rose by a little over half a percent.

The cold stocks Rongfeng, Datong, Commerce, Cement, Zhongs, and Xinya hit their daily limit.

Outside the exchange, all stocks, except Dasheng due to ex-rights, had slightly lower bids, while China and other old stocks rose again by 10% to 20%.

### This Month's Flour Allocation Method: All Procedures Remain the Same

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Rong Jingren, the person in charge of the Fuxin Flour Mill, recently went to Beijing to discuss maintaining the flour allocation in this city for May, and has now returned to Shanghai after completing his mission. He said that the flour allocation method in this city for this month will remain the same. The allocation price and quantity will not be changed for the time being.

### Shaoxing Wine Brewing New Price

Due to the sharp rise in rice prices, the cost of incoming Shaoxing wine has increased sharply. Although prices have risen gradually, they still cannot offset the cost of later goods. There were no transactions in the market yesterday, and the industry is currently gathering to discuss new prices.

### Cotton Yarn Sales Remain Strong; Bids Continue to Rise

--Purchases by Factories on This Street Are Relatively Weak--

Yesterday (the 5th), the Textile Construction Company opened sales of 42-count Tiannv yarn at 9.98 million, 40-count Wuzi yarn at 8.86 million, 32-count Xiantao yarn at 6.96 million, 20-count Shuiyue yarn at 4.6 million, 16-count Feihu yarn at 4.16 million, and 10-count Tongzigun yarn at 3.29 million. The opening prices were the same as the previous period.

Bids in the market continued to rise, especially for 16-count and 20-count coarse yarns, which saw even stronger gains, rising by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine yarns also rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. The highest price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn reached 14.2 million yuan, with the final price at 13.9 million yuan. It is reported that buyers were actively adding positions, but purchases by factories on this street were relatively weak, and those holding goods still had a tendency to hoard.

### Over 1,000 Bags of Hoarded Yarn Seized

[Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to stabilize yarn prices and prohibit hoarding, the Economic Division of the Garrison Headquarters ordered that, from May 1, any yarn merchants found to have yarn in storage for more than one and a half months must be forced to sell it back to the government at the original price. As the deadline has now passed, the Economic Division has been dispatching personnel to inspect the warehouses of manufacturers for several days. It is reported that from May 1 to 3, more than 1,000 bags of yarn have been found in storage for more than one and a half months, and there are even cases of yarn purchased in February of last year that has not yet been sold. The Economic Division is continuing its investigation, and at the same time, it has compiled a list of these manufacturers who disregard the law and the quantity of yarn in their storage and reported it to Commander Xuan, who will notify the Textile Control Committee to recover it at the original price in accordance with the previous order.

### Treasury Department Stipulates Method for Using U.S. Treasury Bonds as Reserve Funds

Regarding the use of U.S. Treasury bonds by banks and money shops in this city to offset part of the deposit reserve funds with the National Bank, the National Bank received a clear order from the Treasury Department yesterday. The method is as follows:

(1) Banks, money shops, and trust companies in all areas that are required to deposit deposit reserve funds with the Central Bank may use short-term treasury bonds of the 36th year that are owned by the bank, money shop, or company as a substitute for half of the reserve funds.

(2) After each bank, money shop, or trust company uses these treasury bonds to pay the equivalent of half of the required reserve funds, whenever there is an increase or decrease in the required reserves, the increase or decrease in the amount to be paid or recovered shall be paid or recovered in national currency in accordance with the original regulations of the Treasury Department. However, in January and July of each year, if each bank, money shop, or company has paid cash or recovered cash in the past, resulting in the treasury bonds paid exceeding half of the total required reserve funds, the excess amount shall be exchanged for cash in that month. If it is less than half, treasury bonds may be used to make up half in that month and exchange for cash.

### The Export Promotion Committee Passes Two Important Cases

[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:00 PM at the Central Bank. Vice Chairman Chen Guangfu was absent due to other business and was replaced by Wu Sida as acting chairman. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM. Two important cases were passed: (1) Measures for the import of processed raw materials, to be handled in four procedures. All rules regarding the permitted import quantities and penalties for violating the measures are stipulated. These measures still need to be submitted to the Export Control Committee for discussion and approval. (2) For the export of soybeans, sesame, peanuts, rapeseed, and their extracted oil, if trade has already been concluded before the customs authorities issue quantitative export permits, withdrawal will be permitted provided it does not exceed our country's allocated quota under the International Emergency Food Council.

### Rayon Firm and Expensive

Although there is news of rayon allocation, the selling price will inevitably increase. Therefore, yesterday, the market was quite firm. 120 Gaoshan Yu Guang opened at 19 million yuan and closed at 8.8 million yuan, hovering around the price range in the morning, with only 1-2 boxes traded. In the afternoon, the asking price decreased by 200,000 yuan, but the final price was still 500,000 yuan higher than last weekend. There was not much change in the factories. Grade B was traded at 10 bales, priced at 21 million yuan, and there were few other transactions. Except for Dacheng plaid which started firm but weakened later, there were no major price fluctuations in other silk fabrics.

### Textile Construction Credit Yarn

[Report from this newspaper] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, totaling 1,867 pieces, all sold to manufacturers. There were a total of 784 applications from manufacturers.

### New Cotton Cloth Purchases Still Active

The cotton cloth market opened steadily. Most of the trading on the market was still dominated by new buyers. Customer demand became stagnant. Transactions of spot warehouse receipts among the industry were quite active, leading to a firm market sentiment. Four Gentlemen Gold Seal Drill cloth rose from 296,000 yuan to 298,000 yuan, with buyers rushing to purchase, but the price stabilized after fewer transactions. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose from 310,000 yuan to 325,000 yuan, Five Blessings rose by more than 20,000 yuan from 300,500 yuan, and 20-count extra fine cloth rose by 5,000 yuan from 251,000 yuan. The markets for other colored cloth and Shilin cloth were also bullish.

### Tea Market Transactions Stagnant

For red and green tea specifically for export, local export firms, considering that the current overseas selling price is lower than the domestic price, have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, transactions have remained extremely stagnant for several days. The trend is for the market to continue to float aimlessly amidst a lack of market confidence, and the foundation remains precarious. As for various types of tea for domestic sale, sales are also generally sluggish. However, because sellers are still generally stable in their thinking, the process is relatively calm.

[Report from this newspaper] China's four major export commodities, tea, have shown a state of decline in foreign sales since overseas selling prices became incongruent with domestic prices. Recently, new tea from various producing areas has been emerging like bamboo shoots after rain. However, because tea merchants have not yet sold out their old tea, they are generally hesitant to purchase new tea. Therefore, it is said that the market in the producing areas is not very active at the moment.

### Industrial Raw Materials Soaring

The market for industrial raw materials soared again across the board yesterday. Few transactions occurred after the market closed, and those holding goods were unusually firm in their convictions. Although buyers offered high prices, they had difficulty making purchases. In the caustic soda market, everyone expected 15 million yuan, and the asking prices were chaotic. Although raw material merchants claimed 8.5 million yuan, this was limited to purchases, and they claimed there were no goods available for sale. N rosin and petroleum jelly have only risen by 60%, which triggered buying interest, and the market also surged fiercely yesterday.

### Watching Tani Hisao's Execution at Yuhuatai

— Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua of this newspaper

Nanjing, April 27th, Quick Dispatch

Tani Hisao, the executioner of the Nanjing Massacre, was finally executed today in front of the people of Nanjing. Although he has been executed by shooting, it still cannot compensate for the loss of those innocent victims. Zhonghua Gate and Yuhuatai were where Tani Hisao once dominated, but today they became the execution grounds where he was killed. He must have thought of the tragedy: "The mountains and rivers have changed, but the vegetation remains the same. The same area, but two different scenes." Those who wielded violence could not escape their fate. The net of heaven is vast, not only did the people of Nanjing cheer, but "humanity" and "justice" also dealt a great blow to the brutal.

Suddenly Changed Color, Stuttering

This morning, the Xiaoying War Criminals Detention Center also opened a temporary court. Court President Shi Meiyu and several military judges came to supervise. At 9:10 AM, Prosecutor Chen Guangyu and Clerk Zhang Diantong ascended the court and brought Tani from prison. Today, Tani Hisao was still so stubborn. The prosecutor routinely asked the defendant's name, age, place of origin, and experience, and threw the peace-reporting letters sent by the defendant's relatives to him. After the defendant read them, he asked, "Do you need to reply to these letters?" Tani Hisao's expression suddenly changed at this point, and he stuttered, "I hope you will let me write." While speaking, his throat choked, and he could hardly speak. After obtaining permission, Tani took out a pencil from his body and tremblingly wrote the last few letters bidding farewell to the world. After finishing the letters, the prosecutor read out the instructions from the National Government: "According to the National (36) Judgment No. 107 submitted by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on March 19th of this year, and attachments, all are understood. After investigation, the defendant Tani Hisao jointly massacred prisoners of war and non-combatants during the war, and raped, robbed, and destroyed property. Since the interrogation has clearly confirmed that he is indeed guilty, the death penalty is appropriate and should be approved." Tani continued to argue as before. The prosecutor, tired of his endless babbling, again asked the defendant if he had any will for his family. Tani was forced to ask for paper to write a will.

A Will, Two Lines of Tears

At this time, hundreds of eyes in the temporary court were focused on Tani, watching him write his last will. The reporter approached Tani and saw a Japanese translator reading the words Tani was writing. The reporter then used shorthand to record the original text. The following is his will to his wife: "To Tani Umeko. Tani Hisao, April 16, Showa 23. My death sentence is about to be carried out. Before I knew the execution date, I had written another letter. Now, I am sending it together with this will as a memento of our eternal separation. Umeko! We cannot grow old together, but you have fulfilled your responsibilities as a wife, and I am deeply grateful. Under the judgment of the Chinese side, I am now to be executed, which is truly regrettable. But whether I have committed international crimes, I believe there will be a day when the truth will be revealed. It doesn't matter to me personally. Although I am shot in Yuhuatai, I have finally fulfilled my last duty to repay the country. Please help Katsumi and Chikaotwo brothers and raise Kiyoko and Hideko to become useful people. Although I die in a foreign land, my soul will eventually fly back to my hometown. At noon on April 26, I will say goodbye to everyone and then say goodbye forever. May you all be happy. Now, I can still stand and say goodbye to everyone, but in a little while, I will fall to the ground. This is unfortunate, but it is also fate. The journey of my life is over. My last state will be seen by Lieutenant General Takahashi and Staff Officer Ogasawara, and they can tell you. Sixty-six years old has become the last year of my life, but all along, I have not thought that I was wrong. I tried my best to the very end, but I was finally shot, which is really regrettable. My dear Umeko, farewell forever! Please cremate my remains and bring my ashes back. May the Tani family be happy! Umeko, farewell!" After finishing the family letter, he immediately wrote a few more sentences to bid farewell to his fellow war criminals Isogu, Tsuchibashi, Uchida, Takahashi, and others. While writing, he was still calm, but when he presented the will to the prosecutor with both hands, his eyes were full of tears. Although he did not shed tears, it is not difficult to imagine the depth of the remorse in the heart of this demon before his death.

Clearing Belongings, Petty to the End

At this time, it was already 10:50 AM. Tani Hisao asked to go to the detention center to sort out his belongings, but the prosecutor did not allow it and only allowed him to sort them out in the courtroom. Thirty minutes later, a soldier brought a standard Japanese-style green and white patterned large package and placed it next to the defendant's bar. The scene was like a servant bidding farewell to his master. The black coat and gray felt hat he wore when he was escorted to China were also among them. At this time, Tani Hisao squatted on the ground and slowly sorted out his belongings, dividing them into three parts. One part was entrusted to the liaison team to be sent back to Japan to his family. Another package of worn clothes was distributed to his fellow prisoners, including a pair of 60% new woolen pants and a pair of socks, specifically designated for war criminal Lieutenant General Takahashi. In addition, a black-barreled fountain pen was to be returned to Ogasawara, a Japanese member of the liaison team. In addition, a map borrowed from the Ministry of National Defense for the trial was also handed over to the court for return to the Ministry of National Defense. During this process, he was still very free in the courtroom. As long as he could think of any items, the soldier would find them for him. When he wrote the will, Warden Huang of the detention center even specially asked him to smoke a yellow-wrapped cigarette, which could be said to be his last enjoyment in this life! While he was sorting out his belongings, he fully demonstrated the pettiness of the Japanese. He even shook the few matchboxes placed in the drawer to see how many matches were left in the box, and he put them in the package. Time passed by minute by minute. His life also seemed to be getting shorter and shorter. At this time, knowing that he was about to be executed, he took off his black cotton shoes and put on his black leather shoes. He also put on the beige gloves that he used to hold his command sword on both hands, and after the prosecutor issued the order to escort him to the execution ground, he put on his old felt hat and was pushed by the military police holding Tani's arms onto the large truck parked in the courtyard to be escorted to the execution ground.

Crowds of People Wherever the Execution Vehicle Passed

After the car left the Xiaoying Detention Center, it passed through Zhujiang Road, Beiting Lane, Daxing Palace, Taiping Road, Jiankang Road, Zhonghua Road, and Zhonghua Gate, coming for another "out of the city ceremony", driving directly to the Yuhuatai execution ground outside Zhonghua Gate. At this moment, I don't know what memories were evoked in Tani. Tani stood in the front half of the truck, with his hands on the roof, watching the war crimes tribunal distributing leaflets printed with his execution along the way. Every street caused a commotion, and the number of people following the execution vehicle numbered in the thousands, all wanting to see the last scene of the Nanjing Massacre's chief culprit being executed.

A Shot Rang Out, Applause Erupted

The execution vehicle was traveling very slowly, and the crowd of onlookers was getting more and more crowded. Everyone temporarily put aside their work and looked up. Many people on Sanshan Street even hired jitney cars to rush to Yuhuatai. The Yuhuatai hill had already been piled up with people two hours earlier. When the execution vehicle approached the execution ground, the entire traffic outside Zhonghua Gate had been cut off. At 11:35 AM, it arrived at the execution ground. A burst of applause came from the hilltop. The evil demon, who did not realize his mistake until his death, could no longer maintain his composure. A pale and very ugly face clearly showed his fear. The military police held him and walked ten steps before stopping, allowing reporters to use their "cameras" to leave a record of his fierce appearance at the moment before his death. Finally, they had him stand facing north and with his back to the south on the execution ground. The two military police holding him were tightly grasped by him, as if he was asking them to save his life, showing that pitiful appearance. After the prosecutor ordered the execution, the gunman aimed at the back of Tani's head and "bang" went the shot. Tani fell to the ground like this, and the crowd on the hill responded with great applause. Ten years of blood debt, today it finally paid back a little when the shot rang out. However, to think that using one Tani Hisao to compensate for the grievances of 400,000 people is really too cheap for him. However, he finally paid with his life, which is also very satisfying.

### Weekday Forum: Prospects of the Indian Political Situation

— Ouyang Zhongyong

On February 22nd of this year, British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Britain would withdraw from India starting on June 1st of next year. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of British-Indian relations. Looking back at the various political reforms and proposals made by Britain in India in the past, they have consistently failed to satisfy the desires of Indian nationalism. The crux of the matter lies in the fact that Britain had not clearly declared the date for the transfer of power to India. Prime Minister Attlee's decisive statement has brought a bright future to India. It is not difficult for us to imagine how elated and overjoyed Indian nationalists will be. The goal of "complete independence" that the National Congress Party has strived for with great difficulty for sixty years is no longer far off. How can they not rejoice and celebrate!

However, upon reflecting on the reality of India, sectarian divisions and internal contradictions obstruct unification at every turn. On one hand, the conflict between Hindus and Muslims seems to have reached an irreconcilable state. The Muslim League insists on "Pakistan," a separation from the "Hindustan" of the Hindu Indians. On the other hand, the princely states of India, which account for two-fifths of the total Indian territory and are scattered like stars, maintain their monarchical traditions since the Middle Ages, observe the Hindu-Muslim conflict from the sidelines, subtly assert themselves, and remain indifferent to the future unification of India. Therefore, the bright prospects of India are still obscured by a dark shadow. From the Indian interim government to the British transfer of power to India, it is a transitional period of uncertainty in Indian politics. The latent internal contradictions are becoming increasingly acute. The political struggle between the Congress Party and the Muslim League is still raging fiercely. The future independent India will be transformed amidst this complex and divergent situation.

Will the future independent India emerge as a "unified, independent, and sovereign republic"? Or will it arise as two sovereign states, "Pakistan" and "Hindustan"? Or will it unfold in the form of more independent states, similar to the dominions within the British Empire? Will the British ruling power be transferred to one Indian government? Or to several Indian governments? Through what procedure will it be transferred? These fundamental questions are what the British, Indian, Muslim League, and princely states are currently considering, mutually contending, and jointly discussing.

During the transition period, the responsibility of promoting the administration of British India is borne by the Indian interim government, with Nehru as Deputy Prime Minister. The responsibility of formulating the future constitution of India, in order to give birth to a new government and receive the transfer of power from the British side, is borne by the Constituent Assembly. The Muslim League, which opposes the Congress Party, while participating in the executive department of the Indian interim government, has repeatedly refused to send representatives to join the Constituent Assembly, which decides the future of India. Its participation in the interim government is likely to emulate the Congress Party's policy of "internal obstruction" against the British scheme of participating in the provincial administration from 1937 to 1939, and does not cooperate sincerely with Mr. Nehru and the Congress Party. Mr. Nehru, internally, feels the restrictions and friction from the Muslim League cabinet members, and externally, is distracted by the Hindu-Muslim bloody struggles that are spreading everywhere, unable to cope, and construction is difficult to implement. Therefore, Nehru suggested to the British that the interim government be responsible to the Constituent Assembly, so that the Constituent Assembly becomes a sovereign body, in order to force the Muslim League to join the Constituent Assembly or withdraw from the interim government.

The Muslim League's persistent refusal to join the Constituent Assembly not only affects the smooth progress of constitution-making but also strengthens the position of the die-hard faction of the British Conservative Party. Churchill criticized the Constituent Assembly, stating that if the Muslim League does not participate, it can only represent the Hindu Indians and cannot represent India, and therefore its decisions are not worthy of respect from the British Cabinet. Prasad, Chairman of the Constituent Assembly, responded with an important statement, listing the composition of the representatives of the previous Constituent Assembly. Of the 296 members elected through elections, 210 attended; the number of Hindu Indian seats was 160, and 155 attended; 33 representatives of the general class, and 30 attended; 7 Christians, and 6 attended; 5 members of backward tribal peoples, 5 Anglo-Indians, 5 Sikhs (that is, those who are employed by the British as constables, soldiers, policemen, turbaned and bearded, all belong to this religion), and 3 Parsis (that is, fire worshippers who migrated from Persia, totaling 115,000 people, concentrated in Mumbai, possessing strong financial resources in industry and commerce), all attended; 80 Muslims, and 4 attended. Therefore, except for the absence of members of the Muslim League, the Constituent Assembly represents various sects, classes, and races. Churchill's criticism is indeed malicious. The Constituent Assembly has adjourned twice, hoping for the participation of the Muslim League. On April 28, the third session was held. Nehru proposed at the meeting to welcome the free participation of various princely states. Only eight princely states have participated in the meeting, with five representatives appointed by the princes and sixteen representatives elected by the people. The higher-level princely states are willing to become independent countries after Britain leaves India. Of course, they will not participate in the Constituent Assembly. Nehru's appeal is unlikely to move the patriotic hearts of the princes, especially the Muslim princes. "Interests" and "security" are the considerations that princes weigh when deciding whether to participate in the Constituent Assembly, because they know very well that once they join a unified Indian central federal government, many of the princes' privileges will be transferred to or restricted by the central government. In this Constituent Assembly, the Muslim League still refused to participate. Last week, Ali Khan, the second leader of the Muslim League, declared: "The Constituent Assembly is dead and cannot be revived." Therefore, the Congress Party's hope of the Muslim League participating in the meeting has become a bubble.

Analyzing the recent developments in India, it can be seen that although India is approaching the door of independence, it is heading towards the path of division. The leaders of the Congress Party, who have always aimed at unified governance, have no choice but to compromise with reality in this situation. Currently, the Congress Party's attitude towards "Pakistan" is no longer a dispute over whether it should be realized, but a negotiation on how to implement it. What Viceroy Mountbatten and Gandhi, Jinnah, and others have been discussing for four weeks is to solicit opinions, draft the outline of the Hindu-Muslim division of governance, and the steps for the British transfer of power. There are two ways to divide India: one is complete division, that is, the full implementation of Jinnah's Pakistan proposal, with the current provincial boundaries as the dividing line, the west including the Northwest Frontier Province, Balochistan, Sindh Province, and Punjab Province, and the east including Bengal and Assam Province; the other is conditional division, that is, the counties in the Pakistan provinces where Sikh Indians and Hindu Indians constitute the majority should be separated from Pakistan and added to "Hindustan." The Sikh Indians of Punjab Province have proposed the slogan of "Sikhistan" division to Jinnah's "Pakistan." Furthermore, the Muslims in the Northwest Frontier Province and other places, under the leadership of Abdu Ghaffar Khan, known as the "Frontier Gandhi," have always supported the Congress Party. A plebiscite should be held for all citizens of the Frontier Province to decide whether they are willing to join "Pakistan."

Under British rule, the political regions of India are divided into two: the eleven provinces of British India and the princely states of India. The British announced the Government of India Act of 1935, which is the constitution of India, divided into two parts. The provincial autonomy part has been implemented in the eleven provinces. The central federal government part has been suspended due to differing opinions among the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the princely states. Therefore, the current central government in Delhi, India, is operating in accordance with the Government of India Act of 1919. The Constituent Assembly meeting in Delhi is formulating a new constitution for India after independence in order to transfer power. Although the Muslim League's refusal to participate in the constitution and its insistence on Pakistan's partition, the Constituent Assembly, having included all sects, classes, races, and a few princely states other than the Muslim League, truly represents the majority opinion of India. Its constitution-making will be more active. The content of the constitution will adapt to the complex environment of India. In principle, it aims to be applicable to all of India, whether it is the original British province or the princely state. In principle, it will make it applicable to each region. Therefore, after independence, three political divisions will emerge in India, namely "Hindustan," "Pakistan," and the "Princely States Group." For the sake of common military defense and economic mutual assistance, these three may form a very loose "Confederation."

When British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Britain would withdraw from India, he had anticipated the possible disputes that might arise within India. Therefore, the content of his statement is worth considering again. The main points are: (1) Britain hopes that the major Indian parties will cooperate sincerely and form a government to succeed British rule; (2) During the transition period before withdrawal, Viceroy Wavell was dismissed and Lord Mountbatten succeeded him; (3) The constitutional proposal and principles proposed by the British Cabinet Mission to India last year have not changed; (4) If the Indian parties still fail to formulate a constitution by the time the withdrawal period arrives, then Britain may transfer ruling power to the provincial governments; (5) Britain has no intention of transferring the ruling power and obligations of the various princely states to the Indian central government. During the transition period, the relationship between the British monarch and the various princely states will be adjusted through agreements. These points can be said to be the principles on which Britain's withdrawal from India is based. Three points are worth noting: (1) The British side does not exert pressure on any party to promote unification but hopes that the major Indian parties will compromise and negotiate on their own to form a government to succeed British rule; (2) If a constitution is not formed by the deadline and the Indian government is difficult to establish, the ruling power will also be transferred to the current eleven provinces of British India; (3) Britain's supreme authority over the princely states remains and does not disappear due to Britain's withdrawal, nor does it transfer with Britain's transfer of the ruling power of India to the Indian government.

Britain's definite statement to withdraw from India on a fixed date and grant India independence is truly worthy of worldwide praise. However, sacrificing unification to strive for independence and bringing about division with independence cannot but be a concern for India. This is caused by the historical factors of Britain's more than two hundred years of rule in India.

Britain's rule in India has enabled all of India, except for a few regions, to live under a central power, which was unprecedented in the history of India and was a pioneering event in Indian politics. Britain's rule has brought stability to Indian society, with no wars or internal conflicts, which is also a fact. Britain's political measures and educational enlightenment have also contributed to the growth of Indian nationalism. However, upon deeper reflection, Britain's rule has failed to dedicate itself to the integration of Indian sects and the harmonization of differences, but has instead tolerated, supported, and fueled them for the sake of the ruler's security. This is excusable, but for the sake of the future of the Indian nation, it is a dangerous step. The bloody tragedies between Hindus and Muslims in recent months have further emboldened the reactionary faction to argue forcefully, proving the legitimacy and necessity of British rule. No Indian army officer has been promoted to the rank of brigadier. Even if the British return the Indian government, military power must still rely on the British General Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. This is because, on one hand, Indian military personnel are of low rank and have no qualifications, and on the other hand, if a Hindu or Muslim Indian were to hold this position, it would inevitably cause sectarian disputes. This example alone shows that unified governance in India is difficult, and division also has many problems. Let us pay attention to the development of the Indian political situation in the future!

Spring and Autumn

### A Bachelor's Confession

— By德·蘇德曼, Translated by 林鳳藻

Ah, dear madam, it is so good to be here, to be with you again, quietly sitting in this comfortable chair, chatting with you at leisure. Thank goodness the holiday turmoil is over, and you can spare some time to be with me again.

Ah, this Christmas season! I believe the devil stirred it up, especially to trouble us bachelors, making those of us without families feel the boredom of life. For others it is a source of joy, but for us it is a real pain. Of course, of course, not every bachelor is lonely; most of us can bring joy to others and find joy ourselves. But this shared joy has a bitter taste; partly because we criticize ourselves with mocking, and partly because we have that acidic expectation: this expectation, I might say, is not homesickness, but a desire for marriage.

You will ask: why not hurry up and "run the rice" (a euphemism for courtship), and pour out your heart? You are a sympathetic person; while most women resent me, you always generously offer me comfort. Ah, you must know, this is not a simple matter. On the third day of this Christmas, you guessed my heart accurately and gave me Spyder's tediously interesting "Lonely Little Sparrow"; do you know what Master Spyder says in that book? He says, "A true bachelor is beyond consolation; after being unhappy, he is willing to remain unhappy."

Besides Spyder's lonely little sparrow, there is also a kind of old bachelor who is a friend of families. I don't mean those who specialize in disrupting families: those who, while enjoying other people's fireside, hypocritically hint at their ulterior motives. I don't mean that kind of person; I mean the good uncle to the children, the good uncle, the old classmate of the children's father; these people put the children on their laps and caress them, while respectfully reciting stories from the evening paper to their mother—stories with indecent parts, of course, omitted.

I know many people who always serve their friends' families; these people live in those families, stay with lovely women, feel great affection in their hearts, but have no desire.

You don't believe me? Ah, perhaps you don't approve of the words "without desire"? You may be right. In the depths of the most docile heart, perhaps there lurks a rough desire, but you must know that this desire is under control.

I can give you an example. I tell you: what two old men talked about on this New Year's Eve. You are not allowed to ask me how I know their conversation, and you cannot tell this to others. Shall we begin?

Please imagine a scene first. An old-fashioned room, with a high ceiling, and a brightly polished lamp hanging on it, very much like the lamps our fathers used before kerosene was used, with a green shade around it, and the room is dimly lit. The lamplight is shining directly on a round table, covered with a white cloth, on which are placed various ingredients, ready for making New Year's sweet wine; in the middle of the tablecloth there are a few oil stains, slowly spreading.

The two old gentlemen are sitting there, half of their bodies under the dim green lamplight. They are relics of a bygone era, each trembling and collapsing there, each vaguely looking into space, their faces revealing the boredom of old age. One of them is the host, a soldier, which is obvious from his appearance. He wears a tightly fitting scarf around his neck; he has a few upturned whiskers on his upper lip, but otherwise it is clean-shaven; his eyebrows are squeezed into the angry look of a junior military officer. He is huddled in a swivel chair, his hands gripping the swivel handle, like holding a curved cane. He sits there motionless, except for his chin constantly moving up and down, making a chewing motion. The other is sitting on the sofa next to the soldier; he is a thin man, with narrow shoulders, a round head, a wide forehead, like a thinker. He casually takes a few puffs from a long pipe, the bowl almost extinguished. His face, matched with sparse curly hair, has smooth, dry skin, covered with countless tiny wrinkles, but in these wrinkles there is a soft and peaceful smile. Only an old age that has abandoned everything and returned to peace has this kind of smile.

The two of them sat without speaking. In this silence, you can hear the sputtering sound of the lamp oil burning, mixed with the sputtering sound of the tobacco oil in the pipe. After a while, from the darkness behind, the clock on the wall,擦的」响, struck eleven.

"It's almost time for you to make sweet wine," said the one with the thinker's mind. His tone was very soft, a little shaky.

"You simply didn't understand her," the guest grumbled. A suppressed aversion appeared on the corners of his mouth, he looked at his friend for a long time, but his expression was very gentle, very miserable, as if his soul was carrying a self-aware sin.

After a moment of silence, he began to speak:

"Hey, Franz, I want to tell you something—this thing has been gnawing at my heart like a mouse for a long time. I can't take this to the grave."

"Then hurry up and start," Franz said. He picked up the long pipe leaning against the swivel chair and loaded tobacco into the bowl.

"Once—something happened—between me and—your wife."

"Don't joke, Dr.先生," Franz said.

"I am serious, Franz. I have kept this thing in my heart for forty years, and now the time has come, I can tell this thing."

"Do you mean to say that my wife cheated on me?" the old soldier shouted in a rage.

"You are truly pitiful, Franz," the philosopher said, a sad and soft smile appearing on his face.

Franz muttered something and lit his pipe.

The philosopher continued, "You are thinking wrong; she was as pure as a true angel. You and I are the criminals. Listen to me; this is a story from forty-three years ago. At that time, you had just been ordered to Berlin as a captain, and I was teaching at the university. You know, at that time you were such a rude and absurd person."

"Oh," Franz said. He raised his trembling hand and twirled his mustache.

"At that time there was a beautiful actress,

"Yes, it's just the right time," the other one said. His tone was quite dry, like the rough voice of an officer giving orders.

The guest continued, "I never thought that without her, it would be so bleak." The host nodded, chewing in his mouth

"She made New Year's sweet wine for us a total of forty-four times."

The officer interjected, "You're right] Since we lived in Berlin, and you came to visit us."

The guest continued, "At this time last year, the three of us were still together, very happy. She was sitting in that armchair, knitting socks for Paul's eldest child, hurrying desperately. She said these socks had to be finished by twelve o'clock. Later, they were finished at twelve o'clock. Then we drank sweet wine and comfortably discussed the problem of death. Two months later, she really went to the grave. You know, I wrote a very important book about the immortality of ideas. At that time, you simply didn't even want to look at it. Since your wife died, I don't want to look at it either. Honestly, what ideas are not worth considering."

The widower said: "Yes, she was a good woman. She treated me very well. Every time I went out to work at five o'clock in the morning, she was already up, and always tried to make sure I could have a good cup of coffee before I went out. Of course, she also had her shortcomings. Whenever she was with you arguing about philosophy—　哟"!" Big black eyes, small white teeth, do you remember?"

"I remember! Bianca was her name." Traces of early absurdity still remained on the old man's weathered face. At this time, a faint smile appeared on his face, but it disappeared immediately. "She would bite, I tell you, she would bite!"

"At that time, you cheated on your wife, and your wife guessed it too. But she never said anything, just suffered in silence. You didn't notice, but I noticed. After my mother died, she was the first woman I knew well. She ran into my life like a shining star, and I looked up at her, treating her as a shining star. Finally, I plucked up the courage to ask her what was on her mind. She smiled and said she didn't feel very well. You remember, this was not long before Paul was born. Then came the eve of the New Year exactly forty-three years ago. That night at eight o'clock I arrived at your house, as usual. She was sitting embroidering; the two of us were waiting for you to come back, and I was reading to her. Time passed like this, an hour passed, and another hour. You still hadn't come back. I saw that she was feeling very uncomfortable, she started to tremble, and I trembled too. I knew what was keeping you from coming back, I was very scared in my heart, I felt that you had forgotten the twelve o'clock in that woman's arms. It was almost twelve o'clock at that time. She stopped embroidering, I stopped reciting, and there was a terrible silence. I saw a tear slowly rolling down from her eyes and falling on her embroidery. I jumped up, ready to go out and invite you home. I felt that I had the ability to pull you back from that woman's side. But just at this time, your wife also jumped up, jumping up from the seat where I am sitting now.

'"Where are you going?"' she said. An indescribable fear was expressed on her face.

'"I'm going to find Franz,"' I said.

'"When she heard this, she almost shouted.

"For God's sake, don't go away, at least you (this word was said very heavily) can be with me. You (this word was said very heavily) don't leave me."'

'"She then threw herself at me, put her hands on my shoulders, and hid her tearful face in my chest. My whole body trembled. No woman had ever been so close to me. But I still supported her, I talked to her, comforted her. She really needed comfort. After a while, you came back, you didn't see my flustered look. Your face was still flushed, and your eyes still showed the fatigue after indulging in drinking wildly.

'"On that New Year's Eve, a change arose in my heart, I was very scared. Since I felt her soft arms around my neck; since I smelled the fragrance of her hair, I felt that this shining star had fallen from the sky, felt that this was not a star, but a woman, a beautiful and breathing woman of love. I myself knew that passion was burning in my eyes; I scolded myself, cursed myself as a rogue, a liar; I then tried to separate you from your mistress, with the purpose of obtaining peace of mind. Luckily, I still had some money, which was inherited from my ancestors; I gave this money to her, she was satisfied, and then—"

'"Damn it,"' the old soldier interrupted, '"So it was you who did the good deed. Bianca wrote me a touching letter of farewell, saying that she had to give up my love, but her heart was already broken."'

'"Yes, I did this thing, I deserve your blame, but listen to me, I gave her money, hoping to exchange this money for peace of mind. But I miscalculated, and wild thoughts always swirled in my brain, getting worse and worse. I buried myself in my work. At that time, I got the central idea of my "Immortality of Ideas論". But it was useless, there was still no peace in my heart.

'"A whole year passed, and New Year's Eve came again. I was sitting next to her again, in this seat. That time you were at home, sleeping on the sofa in the next room, because you were tired from gambling in the club.度was sitting there, very close to her, looking at her pale face, thinking of last year's New Year's Eve in my mind, I couldn't control myself. I thought in my heart, why not kiss her head again, kiss her again, whatever happens, I don't care! The eyes of the two people are matched together. A secret understanding seemed to be revealed in her eyes. I couldn't control myself anymore. I fell at her feet and pressed my face against her knees.

'"I lay there motionless like this for almost two seconds. Then I felt her cold hand pressing on my head, and I heard her softly say;

'"You must be a good person."'

'"Yes, I must be a good person. The person sleeping in the next room trusts me so much, of course I can't bully him. I jumped up, looked around, and felt very sad. She then took a book from the table and handed it to me. I understood what she meant and casually opened the book and recited it. I don't know what I read. Letters danced before my eyes. But gradually, the storm in my heart calmed down. At twelve o'clock, you ran over, still sleepy, you said Happy New Year. At that time, I felt that my sin had already passed, had run far away, in the very distant past.

'"From that time on, I became more peaceful. I knew that she had no love for me, and I had no other intention than to hope for her sympathy. Year after year passed. Your children grew up and started families. The three of us are old. You also stopped being absurd and lived for a woman, like me. I haven't stopped loving her. No, it is impossible to stop loving her. But my love has changed its form. This love has freed itself from worldly desires and turned to spiritual harmony. You always laugh when you hear us talking about philosophy. But if you knew how our souls are fused together, you would definitely be very jealous. Now, she is dead. Maybe next New Year's Eve, we will have to follow her too. Therefore, I must take this opportunity to tell my secret, and I want to say to you: "Franz, I was sorry to you once. Please forgive me!"'"

He stretched out his hand, pleading to his friend, but Franz said angrily:

'"Enough, enough, this is nonsense! There are more to forgive! This news of yours, your confession, is too old-fashioned. I have known these things for many years. Forty years ago she told me the situation in person. Now I want to tell you why I always pursue women before I become an old man——because, when she told me this story, she said: only you are the one she has loved in her life."'

In the silence, his guest stared at him. The擦 on the wall響了一下,敲着

(Today's manuscript squeeze, "An Inch of River and Mountain, an Inch of Blood" will be suspended for one day.)

### Memorial Statue of an Attic Youth

— Liu Shi

The grand Olympic Games, held every four years in front of the shrine of Zeus, were mostly won by youths from the Peloponnese. The rise of Attic youths dates back to the sixth century BC. Anyone who won three consecutive victories could obtain such a memorial statue. As a result, sculptors in general also became interested in and needed to participate in the sports meeting; the great sculptural undertakings of Greece also made significant progress as a result.

This is a collection of the Acropolis Museum in Athens, originally named "Head of the Blonde." In fact, it should be called "Attic Youth" to match the history. Marble sculpture, high C, two two meters, made around 480 BC, unearthed in 1887. The craftsmanship is pure and skillful, the contours are clear, and the expression is solemn, which can be called a typical example of pure Greeks.

### Furthermore, Brother Han Creates a Sketch of the Songjiang Goby Fish

— Wang Xinfu

季　节思满江湖，弹　年来讲信修睦亦籽；

失　　风味好，潑將　　　留圖。

霜警後爽細　嘉，鄕味眞堪二妙晇；

准擬共君携答箸，江湄長伴釣人肅。

(Unable to render the characters in this poem effectively in English, due to their highly allusive and context-dependent nature. It depicts nostalgia for the taste of Goby fish from Songjiang.)

### A Glimpse of the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

— Shi Chongpeng

Among the calligraphy and painting organizations in Shanghai with a long history and a solid organization, besides the Chinese Calligraphy Association, the Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association should be the most prominent. The association holds an annual calligraphy and painting exhibition. This year's art exhibition has been opened on May 2nd at the Chinese Painting Gallery on Chengdu Road. I happened to discuss contemporary calligraphy with my fellow townsman Chen Ganqing, and then we went to visit the association with great interest.

There were more than three hundred works in total. The famous female painters in Shanghai, except for my fellow students　Shouzhu, Sun Menglu, and the Tu Ge and Tu Shi sisters who did not participate, such as Tang Guanyu, Zhang Hongwei, Huang Zhuoqun, Li Qiujun, Wu Qingxia, Gu Qingyao, Wu Manqing, Chen Xiaocui, Bao Yahui, Zhou Lianxia, Rong Junli, Jin Qiusheng, Lei Peizhi, Zhu Erzhen, Bei Yuzhao, and dozens of others, all had masterpieces on display. Landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and paintings of ladies filled the room, each excelling in their own strengths. Now, based on what I can remember, I will briefly express my humble opinions.

Ms. Tang Guanyu is a talented disciple of the contemporary master Feng Chaoran, with one ink landscape and one flower and bird painting, the former imitating Wang Huanghe, the latter learning from Lü Ji, Bian Ai, with elegant charm and scholarly air. Ms. Huang Zhuoqun's meticulous flower paintings have gained much from her teacher, the old man Hongwei's secrets, and are praised for surpassing her teacher. Qiujun's ink landscape painting is thick and solid, showing the depth of her skill. Qingxia's four reed goose paintings make people think of abandoning reeds and autumn water, and she is naturally an old hand in this field. Gu Qingyao's family learning has a long history, and this time there are many unique products, all extremely exquisite, but small paintings are more wonderful than large paintings. Wu Manqing's husband and wife painting exhibition has been well received before, and this time the large landscape imitating Shi Tao has a fresh ink atmosphere, and the brushwork is also vigorous and moving. Bao Yajun is my old classmate Shao Yun's talented disciple, and Lu Lianfu's second-generation disciple. The cloud mountain is vast and ethereal, and she has already been able to enter the hall. Xiaocui Lianzhen's paintings of ladies have a hint of Tang Qiu's style of the Ming Dynasty. Jin Qiusheng is the talented disciple of Ms. Qiujun, and she is thoughtful, studious, and has made great progress. A figure landscape painting is handsome and elegant, between Wu Xiaozhen and Chen Lao Sun. Peizhi is the wife of Lang Jingshan, and the large portrait of　Confucius has the　stone atmosphere. Zhu Erzhen's flowers are quite beautiful, and Yuan　Shu's calligraphy is extremely thick, all of which are masterpieces.

Bei Yuzhao initially studied with Wu Chang, and later studied Lake　, a landscape painting of松雲飛瀑 is almost indistinguishable from the real Lake scenery. Pang Zuoyu's flower paintings, with vigorous and beautiful brushwork and colors, are also the highlight of this art exhibition. Chen Sidong's landscape, the tree method and stone method, seems to be like my teacher Xiao Wuquan's brushwork, other famous painters, Wu Peipei, Yu Mijingyun, Mu Zhen, and Mu Juan's flower paintings, double hook coloring, have a great Yuan style, meaning Kai is all female disciples of Daqian. I passed by in a hurry, and there were many　遺　, and what I discussed, Ganqing said that what he saw was roughly the same.

### Rambling Talks While Alone

— Wang Cong

As the car sped along the road, Hai Tong pointed to the neon lights beside the road and said sadly;

"That red is the blood of the toiling people, that white is sweat."

"No, that green color is sweat," I said. A moment of silence.

Obviously, my brother had understood what I meant.

Because I thought of the hard work on the broad green plain. I also thought of faces that were reflected into a pale green.

"The more prosperous the city, the poorer the countryside. How many people in this city have contributed anything to the vast crowds? And how many rural areas are needed to maintain the city's huge buildings?"

I love Hai Tong's unconventionality, but this is just his innocent babbling. So I said;

"In theory, your words cannot be established. Because you only pointed out a superficial phenomenon based on intuition.

"You must know that when a person is dying, in a very short time, their face will look particularly good, which is called "迴光返照", but this is not a healthy color."

Speaking of this, I couldn't bear to burden my thoughtful brother with my sorrow. But I am willing to record this passage and ask my dear readers to think about it! When a person is sick, do we look for a doctor? Or do we save some legal tender and simply buy a beautiful "coffin"? (I wonder if the ancients added the wood radical to the word "coffin"?)

Two or three years ago, Zugong told me that he was going to write a play called "The Legend of Catching Ghosts". (According to this play has been staged in Shanghai, but the author missed the Zhu Guan due to busy work.) Then he talked about the plot. The last paragraph, which I still find very thought-provoking, said:

"Zhong Jinshi was drunk by five ghosts and fell asleep. When he woke up, it was the 20th century. Zhong Jinshi's tools and methods of catching ghosts could not keep up with the times, so he was beaten by the ghosts, so it became the world now."

This ending (I don't know if this play was later changed due to various considerations?) is full of the meaning of reality. The beauty of comedy lies in crying in laughter.

### What is "Untouchability"?

— Qian

The "Untouchability" (Uhtouckability, literally translated as unapproachable custom), which Gandhi has always regarded as a major stain on Hinduism, has recently been abolished by the Indian Constituent Assembly. We, who are concerned about India's prosperity and free independence, hear the Indian people blowing the horn of social reform, how can we not be extremely pleased.

We　know that Indian society is complex and strange, and the boundaries of social classes are strict. People of different classes never marry or associate. In addition to the four kinds of class distinctions we are familiar with: monks, nobles, farmers, workers, and slaves, there are also various different classes distinguished by occupation, and there are as many as two or three thousand kinds of detailed classifications.

These artificial class distinctions have made Indian society fragmented. Moreover, all artificial inequalities hinder India's development and progress.

The most miserable class is the "Untouchable Class" (Untoucnables). The so-called Untouchability is the attitude of ordinary people towards people of the Untouchable Class. In the eyes of people of other classes, the nature of people of the Untouchable Class is lowly and filthy. Superior people must not only never come into contact with them, but also their shadows must not be touched, and even their traces must not be seen, so as not to defile the eyes of superior people.

As a result, the more than 40 million people in India belonging to the "Untouchable Class" have been absolutely discriminated against by the ideology of untouchability. They are confined to living in special areas, cannot participate in all activities of superior people, many public roads cannot be taken, and they have to avoid superior people on the road. In short, they live an inhuman life, a life worse than cattle and horses.

Obviously, if India wants to revive, it must break the distinction between social classes, and the abolition of Untouchability is even more urgent. Now, we are about to see one-seventh of the Indian population, because of the abolition of Untouchability, has obtained the guarantee of basic human rights, we really want to congratulate India's future.

### Fighting Fish

— Bai Gao

The Siamese fighting fish (Betta pugnax) of Thailand are inherently aggressive, always prepared to fight and kill males of their own species. These fish, when kept in aquariums, need to be separated to prevent them from gathering together. The Siamese fighting fish is a small, clear-water fish, similar to the Chinese Paradise fish, only as long as a human finger. However, their combat is surprisingly fierce, piquing the interest and gambling desires of the Thai people. At one point, some Thais even bankrupted themselves due to gambling on fighting fish, and some even wagered their freedom, losing it in the process.

Therefore, excellent fighting fish are very valuable, and their breeding requires extreme care. Male fighting fish are often fed mosquito larvae, which is similar to wheat in nourishing the fish. These fish are extremely good at nurturing their offspring, covering their nests with a barrier made from their own saliva, providing strict protection.

There are two common methods of judging fighting fish in Thailand. The first is a refined, aesthetic approach. Two fish are placed in separate glass tanks, positioned side by side so they can see each other through the glass. The fish's color is usually yellow-gray, but after the tanks are placed together, a gradual change occurs. When they detect the presence of an enemy, they gradually flare up, and the color changes from yellow-gray and brown to a gorgeous purple, with the entire body displaying vivid colors. Then, the gill covers flare, like unfurled sails, and the fin membrane expands, colored blood-red. They attack each other, only to be stopped by the glass partition. This is a color contest, with the most beautiful color being the victor.

If two fish are placed in the same tank, the winner is not decided by color, but by the sharpness of their teeth. They need to fight to the death before stopping. When they first encounter each other, their bodies are full of vibrant colors, and they circle and chase each other. Then, they suddenly charge, causing scales to break off, teeth to be damaged, and eyeballs to be pulled out of their sockets. The first to sink to the bottom of the tank loses. The loser's sides will show two long, prominent black streaks, resembling mournful thoughts of pain. However, the victor often does not allow the defeated to survive, continuing the pursuit until both are wounded.

Public fighting fish arenas have long existed in Thailand. Those engaged in this business need to hold a license, and the privilege of issuing licenses belongs to the King personally. The history of these arenas is at least one hundred years old.

### Talking about Puns and Wordplay

— Chaoyang

Chinese characters are mostly pictographic and ideographic, but the pun, which uses phonetic similarity, often produces unexpected results. Using puns in anecdotes or storytelling is relatively easy, but using them in couplets is more challenging. Yesterday, a friend recited a couplet: "A boy strikes a tung tree, the tung fruit doesn't fall, the boy is not happy; a maiden eats hemp cakes, the hemp cakes are truly fresh, the maiden is truly immortal." I think this is vernacular. If classical Chinese is used and ancient names are embedded, it shows even more ingenuity, truly achieving effortless perfection, erasing all traces of labor. For example, in the couplet "Two boats sailing together, Lu Su's oars are not as fast as Fan Kuai's sail; eight instruments playing in turn, Di Qing's flute is hard to compare to Xiao He's xiao flute," one can say that the writing is born of nature, a lucky coincidence. This is like the wordplay "frozen rain sprinkles the window, east two dots, west three dots; cutting cake for guests, top seven cuts, bottom eight cuts," picked up at random, all becoming wonderful creations. The minds of scholars are truly like mercury spilled on the ground, penetrating everywhere. Perhaps when the sage created the characters, he had already reserved this kind of distribution to test the skills of those who create couplets?

### Art and Literary Circles

The National Shanghai Conservatory of Music will hold its fourth student concert at 7:30 PM on the 1st (Thursday) of this month in the school's auditorium in the city center. There are many programs, totaling nineteen vocal and instrumental pieces, including a string trio, violin solo, cello solo, piano solo, and soprano and tenor solos, baritone solo, and mixed quartet, etc. The performance results are quite good, and a few students' works (a violin solo by Wu and a string piece) will also be included.

The "Free Talk" monthly magazine of the Literary Society is about to be published, edited by Lü Baihua. It features Zi Kai's cartoons, Xie Bingying's correspondence, and essays by Shi Zhicun, Dai Wangshu, Wei Jinzhi, Zhao Jingshen, Lu Danlin, etc., and short stories by Zhao Qingge, Hu Shanyuan, Chen Bochui, etc. The content is rich and pure, a good reading material for young people.

Bao Yahui, wife of Pan Xulun, has been practicing landscape painting for thirty years with profound skill. Recently, many of her works were exhibited in the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition, attracting the attention of the audience, and many buyers were eager to purchase them.

### "Reading Behind Closed Doors"

— Xiao Yin

Probably due to the stimulation of the democratic trend, student movements in recent years seem to be more active, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, some people disapprove, saying that students' responsibility is to study, and that matters outside of studying are not worth paying attention to.

Those who say these words undoubtedly have very "pedantic" minds. The era of locking students in schools, making them hold books and recite "zhī hū zhě yě" or "ABCD" is long gone. Here, I do not want to bring out the grand banner of "reading without forgetting nation-building," but letting passionate young people could not help but shout a few words, is not entirely reprehensible, right?

In the Records of Ming Scholars, it says: "Gu Jincheng, whose courtesy name was Jishi, also known as Jingfan, was the brother of Mr. Jingyang. One day, he sighed deeply. Jingyang asked, 'Why do you sigh?' He said, 'I sigh at the scholars of today, who, even if the sky is falling and the earth is collapsing, do not care and only focus on lecturing!'... Jingyang was moved by this."

These two old men lived in the Ming Dynasty hundreds of years ago and still had such insights. If, in the increasingly civilized modern era, someone still advocates "reading behind closed doors," wouldn't they be looked down upon by the ancients?

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

But in the afternoon, he experienced the bitterness of being too familiar with and not understanding the general bureaucratic atmosphere of Chinese government offices. He arrived at the First Section, and Section Chief Yu came out to meet him, but office work requires procedures!

"I'm sorry, Mr. Zhu, this won't work!" After Lao Zhu excitedly explained his intentions and his previous contacts with Director Xiong, the gloomy section chief said coldly in his thick Guangxi-accented Mandarin, "Director Xiong hasn't approved it, we won't connect!"

"Didn't he mention it to you?"

"Even if he did, it's useless!" Section Chief Yu still shook his head. "We always have to see the official document before we can handle things!"

Lao Zhu knew that arguing with him was useless, so he returned to the director's office to find Director Xiong again. But Director Xiong was not so free. He hadn't arrived by 2:45 PM, and finally came at 3:30 PM. However, so many guests, so many phone calls, and so many so-called "official matters" had formed a wall of copper and iron around him, making it impossible for Lao Zhu to get close to him. Finally, he did manage to see him, but Director Xiong, who had been busy all day, had mostly forgotten about the matter. Lao Zhu had to be polite first, then stare at him, then complain, acting out a set of actions like in a play. Only then did the great director pick up his pen and write a few ambiguous words on the letter of introduction that Lao Zhu had brought, as an approval for Section Chief Yu of the First Section.

Lao Zhu held this precious letter and jumped straight to the First Section.

"How many of you are going together?" The bureaucratic Section Chief Yu read the letter four or five times and suddenly raised this question. (64)
