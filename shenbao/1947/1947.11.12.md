### U.S. Government to Request $300 Million in Aid to China from Congress; Detailed Plan to be Submitted Next Week

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 11th (Radio): Washington dispatch, Secretary of State Marshall continued today in the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses to request urgent aid to countries that have suffered from war. He stated: the government requests Congress to provide approximately three hundred million U.S. dollars in aid to China. Marshall said that according to U.S. estimates, China needs approximately twenty million U.S. dollars per month, indicating that U.S. aid will be extended to a period of fifteen months, with the first batch of aid to China estimated at sixty million U.S. dollars. While Secretary Marshall was speaking, Under Secretary of State Lovett sat beside him. Lovett said that the amount of aid to China is only an approximation. It is understood that the stipulation of this amount is clearly related to the still unpublished Wedemeyer report.

(Reuters, Washington, 10th) Deputy Secretary of State Lovett announced today that the government will submit a detailed plan to Congress special session on November 17 to aid China. The purpose of this plan is to stabilize China's economy, not to complete a large-scale construction like that of Europe. It is widely rumored here that the amount of aid to China will be 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. Lovett declined to comment on this figure.

(Central News Agency, Washington, 10th) U.S. House Speaker Martin and Republican leaders such as Congressman Judd are in favor of including the aid to China plan in the agenda of the special session of Congress.

(Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th) Director of the Information Department of the Executive Yuan, Tung Hsien-kuang, declared: "The Chinese people are very gratified that Secretary of State Marshall announced that the U.S. government is preparing a concrete plan for economic aid to China in order to submit it to Congress as soon as possible. The urgent situation in China has been fully recognized by the U.S. government, and our government is paying close attention to this."

(Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th) Authoritative sources recently commented on Secretary of State Marshall's announcement in the joint session of the U.S. Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees that "he is drafting a concrete plan for economic aid to China in order to submit a report to Congress as soon as possible," saying: Secretary Marshall did not specify whether the aid to China plan will be submitted to the special session of Congress on the 17th of this month, and this ambiguous announcement is indeed an interesting move. Currently, there are clearly two factions among American officials and the public regarding their stance on aiding China: one faction advocates immediate and comprehensive aid to China, placing the aid to Europe plan and the aid to China plan under consideration by Congress in order to adopt a balanced security policy in the East and West; this faction includes all or part of the opinions of Ambassador Stuart, Wedemeyer, Bullitt, Vandenberg, Martin, and Judd. The other faction advocates aiding Europe first to counter the expansion of Soviet power in Eastern Europe, while postponing aid to China. The reason for Secretary Marshall's decision on this opinion is to enable the huge expenditures of the aid to Europe plan to gain smooth support in Congress. The divergence of these two opinions has been extremely evident since the publication of Bullitt's "Impressions of a Visit to China" a month ago, and has become a powerful factor in leading public opinion in the journalistic community. The fierce attacks by those who advocate immediate aid to China on Marshall and Truman's unhealthy one-sided policy have forced Secretary Marshall to speak out in the joint session of the congressional foreign affairs committee in advance as a means of easing tensions. However, it is difficult to predict whether this strategy can silence the opposition and stop their efforts to promote the joint submission of the aid to China plan and the aid to Europe plan to Congress. With only one week left before the special session of Congress, whether Secretary Marshall will use this appropriate time to persuade the opposition or expedite the completion of his "concrete aid to China plan" will be finally determined in this week by the insistence of the opposition and the existence or absence of Secretary Marshall's further guarantee of aid to China. The source believes that American prices will be affected by the amount of its foreign aid, but will not shake its fundamental principles. If Secretary Marshall delays the submission of the aid to China plan in order to win the amount of aid to Europe, it is truly unfair.

### Judd's Speech in the United States: If the Current Situation in the Far East Does Not Change, the Soviet Union Will Control All of Asia Without Bloodshed

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Republican Congressman Judd, having completed his investigation of China and Japan, declared today that MacArthur's greatest worry is the situation in China. He acknowledged having been told by MacArthur in Japan that if the Communists control China, America's plans in Japan and Korea will not succeed. MacArthur's work in Japan is arduous, almost unbelievable, but he fully understands the situation in China. No matter how perfect the work in Japan and Korea is, if the Chinese Communists are not contained, it will still be in vain. The current situation in China, with the Communists gaining ground inch by inch, is exactly the same as Greece half a year ago. The United States' refusal to support the Chinese National Government has endangered the entire Far East plan, or may be beyond salvation. I have notified Secretary of State Marshall of this intention along with my suggestions. Marshall's attempt to promote reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communists in his capacity as a special envoy to China last year was unwise, because the United States maintained neutrality, the Communists continued to receive assistance, while we refused to aid our Chinese allies. He also said that if the situation does not change, the Soviet Union will control all of Asia without bloodshed. Although the United States defeated Japan, the victory belongs to the Soviet Union. As it stands, the withdrawal of American troops from Japan is tantamount to handing the country over to the Communists, because no matter how democratic Japan is under MacArthur's administration, Japan will inevitably be unable to maintain its democracy once the Communists control China. Japan's economic future is closely related to China. China has not completely despaired, but we must implement a concrete plan for China.

### Aid to China is More Important Than Aid to Europe, Taft Delivers Speech

[United Press, New York, 11th] Republican presidential candidate Senator Taft delivered a speech at the banquet of the Ohio State Association in New York on the 11th, criticizing the Marshall Plan and the State Department's failure to publish the Wedemeyer Report. He stated that the United States should consider the proposal to aid China before considering aid to Europe. He asked, "Where is the Wedemeyer Report? Unless we simultaneously consider the proposal to aid China and our responsibilities in South America, we should not consider Europe." He emphasized that the Wedemeyer Report was kept secret and became the government's biggest secret, and asked, "Who knows what these are?"

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Declines Candidacy, Formally Notified Central Party Headquarters; Negotiations on Democratic Socialist Party List Continue

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] After reviewing the list of National Assembly delegate candidates nominated by the Kuomintang, where he was nominated as a candidate for Fenghua County, President Chiang today formally notified the Central Party Headquarters of his decision to decline. He reiterated the essence of his speech at the memorial week meeting this past Monday, saying: "Today, we should dedicate ourselves more to revolutionary responsibilities and focus on our duties. My responsibilities are numerous and important, and I have absolutely no desire to participate in the election, so that local public opinion can elect suitable local people or other comrades to serve as delegates, thus establishing a model of democracy."

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, November 11th] The issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's list of National Assembly delegate candidates made no progress on the 11th, and appears to have reached a deadlock. Xu Chuanlin stated his intention to visit Chairman Chiang to seek a decision. He believes that Chairman Chiang may not be fully aware of the Democratic Socialist Party's current demands and insistence. Therefore, he specifically contacted Wu Dingchang today to discuss the possibility of visiting the Chairman. Xu told reporters that if there is no hope for negotiation, he will return to Shanghai and decide to notify the branches in various provinces and cities not to participate in the National Assembly elections. However, he emphasized that this matter is unrelated to participation in the government. Xu repeatedly explained that if they do not participate in the National Assembly, it is imperative that Chairman Chiang and the outside world understand the truth. Jiang Yuntian, Zhan Yiqiao, Lei Zhen, and others returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 11th. The meeting between Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Junmai has also not yet reached a conclusion. It is only known that Zhang Junmai is now willing to reduce the original seventy-four candidates requiring adjustment by ten names, but cannot concede further. The Kuomintang, through Chen Lifu's negotiation, can only offer fifteen more names, so the gap remains considerable.

If there is a deficit in the revenue and expenditure of each province and city budget, it will still be supplemented by the central government.

### Beitashan

Geographers Prove Beyond Doubt That It Belongs to Our Territory

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th] Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United States, made a statement in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 8th regarding the attack by armed forces of the Mongolian People's Republic on the Beitashan area of our territory. He also refuted the Soviet claim that Beitashan is not within Chinese territory. Today, the reporter specifically visited Fu Jiaojin, a geographer and the current Director of the Fangyu (Territorial) Department of the Ministry of Interior, to request him to provide evidence from historical facts and documents regarding the border, in order to prove that Beitashan is indeed within the territory of China. Fu stated: Beitashan is also known as Beida Shan, Baitakeshan, or Baitashan. It is located northeast of Qitai County in Xinjiang Province of China, more than 600 li (approximately 300 kilometers) from the border of Outer Mongolia, approximately at 91 degrees 1 minute east longitude and 45 degrees 3 minutes north latitude. It is extremely clear that the mountain should be under the jurisdiction of Xinjiang Province, China. Fu then listed evidence from three aspects: relevant official documents regarding the Xinjiang-Mongolia border, historical records, and Chinese and foreign maps, proving that Beitashan is within the jurisdiction of Xinjiang Province beyond any doubt.

### Judicial Administration Conference Concludes; Declaration Issued Outlining Five Objectives

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, November 11th] The 11th was the final day of the National Judicial Administration Conference.

Editorial

### Thoughts on Commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday

Today, as the entire country is about to hold general elections, we are once again celebrating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. In addition to celebrating enthusiastically, we recall the history since Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth eighty-one years ago, and we look forward to the future of our country's founding and revival. We are truly filled with all sorts of emotions, and do not know where to begin. Dr. Sun Yat-sen fought for the revolution for forty years, for the sake of national salvation and nation-building. Throughout his life, he always burned with patriotic enthusiasm, advocated the Three Principles of the People for revolutionary nation-building, struggled arduously, feared no difficulties, and avoided no dangers. With a spirit of great righteousness and strength, he led the National Revolution until the very moment of his death, when he still did not forget "Peace, struggle, save China." Today, after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, our country has suffered from the disturbances of the communist bandits, which has greatly impacted the work of nation-building. We, who are survivors, only feel deeply ashamed before Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, if everyone could have acted according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit, "Peace, struggle, save China," then a new China based on the Three Principles of the People would have already appeared before our eyes.

In commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we must first understand that the purpose of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's forty years of dedication to the National Revolution was not only to seek China's freedom and equality, but also to seek the democratization of China's political and economic systems. The people of the whole country, inspired by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, fought arduously for eight years under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and finally won the victory and lifted the shackles of unequal treaties that had existed for a century. It can be said that the goal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism has been achieved. However, after the victory, due to the successive communist problems, the victory did not bring peace and light, but instead brought new disputes, so that today the whole country is in a state of war. Therefore, the Principle of Democracy advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen still needs to be promoted, and the implementation of the Principle of Livelihood is felt to be almost untouched. On the surface, China seems to have achieved freedom and equality, but in reality, the internal crisis is deepening day by day. If we cannot inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and work harder to implement the Three Principles of the People, then our country will still face the danger of national subjugation and extermination. If we study the reasons for the deepening of the internal crisis, it is not difficult to understand that the crux of the problem lies in the communist bandits. The reason why the communist bandits have become a problem is due to the harm caused by the theory of proletarian dictatorship. However, the lack of political integrity and the increasing impoverishment of the people are ultimately important factors in cultivating the communist bandits. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly told the people of the country that they must concentrate all their efforts to intensify the work of suppressing the bandits. We should demand that the government thoroughly eliminate the corrupt politics that harm the people and eliminate the corrupt officials who plague the people, in order to stop the source of communist bandits. At the same time, we also have the responsibility to awaken the whole people to eliminate the communist bandits in order to clear the thorns for nation-building.

Secondly, what we must carry out at the same time as suppressing the bandits is the implementation of constitutional government and the promotion of the Principle of Livelihood. The National Government resolutely convened the National Assembly on November 15th last year, completing the great undertaking of drafting a constitution for our country, and set it to be implemented on December 25th of this year, just forty or fifty days from now. The whole country is now actively preparing for general elections. This is the beginning of our country's implementation of constitutional government, and it is also the first step for our people to exercise the four powers. As the saying goes, "Be careful in starting things." Whether it is the people who exercise the right to elect, or the people who are running for office, they should be particularly careful. The people should especially cherish their own vote, not only actively participate in voting, but also freely express their own will, not be lured by benefits, and not succumb to threats. Those who are running for office should pay special attention to political morality, learn the ways of democratic countries, and never use illegal means to achieve personal desires. The people's exercise of the four powers is a characteristic of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of Democracy, and in the four powers, in terms of the right to elect, we should be particularly careful in exercising the right to elect today. In terms of the promotion of the Principle of Livelihood, our country has been destroyed by the enemy during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, and has long been exhausted. After the victory, there was no opportunity to recuperate, and today it has reached the point where "the people have no means of livelihood." The government should make a decisive decision and resolutely implement new policies, so that the farmers who have been oppressed for a long time and could not get enough to eat and keep warm can breathe a sigh of relief, and then implement the policy of equalizing land ownership, so that they can have their own cultivated land. We believe that if the government is determined to implement the Three Principles of the People, especially the Principle of Livelihood, and perseveres with it, then the vast majority of farmers will be given a chance to live and will wholeheartedly support it. Even if the communist bandits want to lure and coerce them, the farmers will inevitably turn away from them. Why would they be deceived and become tools in the end? Therefore, the military action of suppressing the bandits must be combined with new policies aimed at the countryside to alleviate the suffering of the farmers, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Finally, we should know that although China is unfortunately suffering from internal strife, China still occupies a very important position in the international arena, and China really has a bright future that can be viewed with great optimism. Not to mention that the whole country should have this common belief, even friendly countries all hope that China can become a strong, unified, and democratic new China. Strong, unified, and democratic can be said to be the only direction of our country's efforts in the future. Yesterday, we read the editorial of the English-language "The China Daily News", "The Federal Republic of China", which quoted the opinion of a foreigner, talking nonsense about China's political system, and even had the absurd theory of dividing China into two or three countries. We cannot but raise the special vigilance of the people of the country. China must be unified in order to be strong; and only a unified and strong China can contribute to peace in the Far East or peace in the world. Conversely, any plan to divide China, no matter how good the fantasy, will only weaken China's strength and constitute a factor that endangers the world. Dr. Sun Yat-sen expressed dissatisfaction with both central centralization and local decentralization, and therefore pioneered the system of balanced power, which is moderate and appropriate, and can be said to be one of the most vehement opponents of the federal system of provinces. Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we cannot but take this opportunity to correct these erroneous theories that are not the right medicine for the disease.

### Celebrating Industry Day; Enthusiastic Celebrations Held in Various Places

Hangzhou

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, November 11th] Today is the first Industry Day. Zhejiang's industrial leaders held a celebration meeting in the morning and sent a special telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express their respect. In the afternoon, they discussed the handling of Japanese reparations and industrial development. They resolved to propose to the government that each industry report its losses, which should be compensated in currency or by distributing the reparations in the form of stocks to the affected factories. They also requested that the government provide the same treatment to raw materials and loans as Shanghai to help Zhejiang's industrial development, and that Japanese cocoons be used to maintain the work of silk factories.

Chongqing

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, November 11th] The capital was decorated with national flags today to celebrate the first Industry Day. The venue of the Bankers Association was packed, with more than 400 industrial representatives and guests attending. The meeting began at 11:30, chaired by Pan Yangshan, who explained the origin of Industry Day. This was followed by speeches by Zhang, Sun Yuanliang, Jiang Guoguang, Hu Ziang, Cai Henian, and others. Sun emphasized that industry should take the lead, not just the military, because if the military takes the lead, there will inevitably be internal and external troubles. After lunch, there were performances of Peking opera and other entertainment. The audience could also participate in a raffle, with prizes donated by various factories, the first prize being a sewing machine.

Chengdu

[This Newspaper, Chengdu, November 11th] The Sichuan Western Industrial Association held a grand meeting on the 11th to celebrate the first Industry Day, enthusiastically passing resolutions to ask the government to assist in production, support the existing industry, and promote Sichuan's industrial development.

### Central Bank of Beiping Ordered Yesterday to Suspend Sale of Forward Foreign Exchange

[This Newspaper, Beiping, November 11th] The Central Bank of Beiping was ordered today to suspend the sale of forward foreign exchange, and purchases are limited to one-month terms. The financial black market in Beiping has been turbulent for the past two days. The US dollar is about to exceed a significant round number, reportedly due to the influence of Shanghai.

### Jiangxi Commodity Prices Rise Again

[This Newspaper, Nanchang, November 11th] Commodity prices in Jiangxi are trending upwards again. According to news from the credit reporting agency: Wanshan yarn is not available on the market, late rice is 290,000, tea oil is 960,000, Guanshang wood is 1,450,000, Guanxia Zheng wood is 1,300,000, but the sugar market is sluggish, Saixue sugar is 550,000, brown sugar is 400,000, and ordinary interest is 8 yuan.

### Shanghai Yarn Merchants Petitioned Ministry of Economy, Agreed to Consider

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, November 11th] The Shanghai Yarn Merchants Association believes that the industry is responsible for regulating the reproduction and rural sideline industries across the country. However, the joint distribution method does not value the industry's position. Therefore, the association publicly recommended Tang Zhiliang and nine others to come to Beijing to petition. When they arrived at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Minister Chen and Vice-Minister Zhang received them separately. After listening to the industry's requests, they said they would consider them. Secretary-General Gan of the Executive Yuan said that he would discuss the issue with the Ministry of Economic Affairs immediately. Councilor Ma of the National Economic Commission promised to forward the issue to the Secretary-General for inclusion in the agenda.

### Some American Merchants Lack Credit; Hong Kong Importers Full of Complaints

[United Press, Hong Kong, November 11th] The Far Eastern Economic Review reported on the 11th that some Hong Kong and Chinese importers of American goods have recently complained that the goods shipped by American exporters often do not match the conditions and types in the contract. Merchants' grievances are mostly concentrated on the irrevocable letter of credit system, where American merchants can obtain loans from banks before their goods arrive at their destination. By the time the orderers discover that the goods do not match the contract or are of poor quality, it is too late to file a claim. The article also listed the following facts:

Large oranges, ordered from the United States, numbered 280 to 220 per box, but when the goods arrived, there were 330 to 345 small oranges per box, resulting in poor sales and significant losses for importers.

Glassware and transparent combs were ordered, but when the goods arrived, they turned out to be celluloid products.

Well-known brand-name car tires were ordered, but when the goods arrived, they turned out to be inferior tires of unknown brands.

Pigments with a strength of 300% had a strength of only 100% to 150% upon arrival, and the packaging and brand names were different from those ordered.

The article also pointed out that Asian buyers mostly purchase well-known brand-name goods, so importers often suffer losses due to new goods.

Although importers have documents signed by customs officers, most of them do not receive replies when sent to the United States. If the matter is pursued through the US Consulate, it takes too much time.

### Wuyuan Tea Awaits Export; Tea Merchants Fund Repair of Roads and Bridges

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, November 11th] Thousands of boxes of tea from Wuyuan, Anhui, urgently need to be transported for export to earn foreign exchange.

### Shijingshan Steel Plant Pig Iron Planning to Promote Sales in South America

[This Newspaper, Beiping, November 11th] The iron-making furnace of the Shijingshan Steel Plant will begin producing iron next year, and there are plans to promote pig iron sales in South America.

Chen said that currently, the domestic production cost of pig iron has exceeded the market price. The supply is currently limited, and promoting sales abroad is a last resort.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, November 11th] Guo Guti, Director of the Northeast Power Bureau, said that the 15,000 kilowatts of power generated in Jinzhou and Jinxi have been reduced due to uneven coal supply. The thermal power in southern Northeast China has shrunk. Currently, 60,000 kilowatts are generated.

### Adjustment of Subsistence Allowances for Provincial and Municipal Air Defense Officers and Soldiers

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The subsistence allowance standards for various provincial and municipal personnel were not adjusted in August.

The subsistence allowance for state-funded students will be handled according to the regulations for state-funded students in national schools, with an allowance equivalent to one-seventh of the basic amount of local public education personnel's living subsidy. Future adjustments will be made according to the regulations for state-funded students in national schools, along with adjustments to the living subsidy.

### Vandenberg Questions European Aid Plan, Marshall Continues to Explain: More Than $2.6 Billion Needed in Current Fiscal Year, Emphasis on Making Germany Self-Sufficient

(News from this newspaper) New York, 11th Broadcast: Washington News - Under questioning from Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Marshall replied that according to his estimates, the total amount of U.S. foreign aid would be approximately $2,657,000,000 in the fiscal year ending June 30th of next year. This amount would be divided into: emergency aid of $597,000,000 to Austria, France, and Italy, $50,000,000 in transportation costs for U.S. occupied areas, $1,500,000,000 in the first batch of formal aid under the Marshall Plan, and $60,000,000 in the first batch of aid to China.

Under further questioning from Vandenberg, Marshall also stated that aid to Greece and Turkey might need to be increased, but it would not be proposed within the current fiscal year. Marshall strongly stated that the U.S. must make Germany self-sufficient, but only on the condition that it does not restore its war-making capabilities. He strongly denied accusations from other countries that the U.S. was attempting to revive German military strength, calling it a distortion of facts. He said that the purpose of restoring the German economy was, first, to prevent the defeated country from continuing to be a burden on the U.S., and second, to help the economic recovery of all of Europe. Marshall's remarks appeared to be in response to accusations previously made by the Soviet Union at the foreign ministers' conference. Vandenberg then asked whether the four-year European recovery plan initiated by the U.S. would create a barrier between East and West. Marshall replied that the current relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union did not need to be described in detail, but he believed that there was still "hope" for the future, and that this division would not be permanent. Marshall placed particular emphasis on the German problem, believing that European security was truly tied to it.

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] Taft claimed to support "reasonable" European aid, but opposed large expenditures. He frankly stated that when the special session of Congress opens, he will demand that all aspects and results of the Marshall Plan be thoroughly studied and debated. He claimed that the Truman administration, through the International Bank, extracted $4 billion to lend to Britain, secured funding for the Export-Import Bank, and contributed $3 billion to the UNRRA, but most of these funds have been wasted. Taft raised four major objections to the Marshall Plan: It would be extremely dangerous to impose 8 billion in new taxes in the coming year based on the scale of aid self-determined by European aid recipients. Excessive exports will inevitably lead to inflation. Taft criticized the government for wasting money abroad to maintain the U.S.'s high economic level, and warned that such an economy would collapse, citing the Great Depression of 1930 as a warning. Can the Marshall Plan produce the expected results? Taft claimed that the U.S. overemphasized the importance of money; European countries' acceptance or rejection of communism depended on ideals, not U.S. loans. Excessive exports will revive wartime controls. He believes that the restoration of price controls is a great misfortune for the U.S. during peacetime, and the benefits that the Marshall Plan might bring are not enough to offset it.

### Details of Emergency Aid to Europe Bill Submitted to Congress by U.S. Government; No Decision Yet on European Currency Stabilization Fund

(Reuters, Washington, 10th) The State Department submitted a detailed legislative bill for emergency aid to Europe to the Congressional Committee on the 10th. According to the bill, France will receive 110 million in grains, 3 million in dairy products, 20 million in fats and oils, 116 million in American coal, 9 million in German coal, 22 million in petroleum products, 38 million in cotton, and 9 million in fertilizer. Austria will receive 20 million in grain, 13 million in coal, 7 million in seeds and fertilizer, and 2 million in medical supplies. Italy will receive 128 million in grains, 12 million in fats and oils, 5 million in soybeans, 2 million in dairy products, 36 million in American coal, 10 million in German coal, 13 million in petroleum products, 19 million in agricultural supplies, including fertilizer, etc., and 2 million in medical supplies. The U.S. will establish individual agreements with France, Italy, and Austria to ensure that they fully utilize the relief materials for relief and construction purposes, and will require recipient countries to fully publicize the U.S.'s willingness to provide aid. The President has the power to order the cessation of aid to recipient countries that violate these conditions.

(Reuters, Washington, 10th) Undersecretary of State Lovett said at a press conference that the State Department has not yet made a decision on the Paris Economic Cooperation Conference's proposal to establish a European currency stabilization fund with 3 billion. Lovett's statement was made after Marshall announced his foreign aid plan to the Foreign Relations Committees of both houses of Congress. Lovett said that Italy's recent urgent needs will be met by transferring funds from the UNRRA relief program to Austria after the end of the UNRRA, which has already been approved.

### Britain Welcomes Douglas's Execution of the Marshall Plan

(Associated Press, London, 10th) After the news arrived here from Washington on the 10th that US Ambassador to the UK Douglas might be selected as the executor of the Marshall Plan, the Foreign Office expressed its welcome. A Foreign Office spokesman said that Harriman's report was being carefully studied.

### Opening of Twenty-One Nation European Customs Conference

(Reuters, Brussels, 10th) The research conference of twenty-one countries discussing the European customs union held its first meeting here on the 10th. The meeting was convened by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. India, Pakistan, South Africa, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand also sent observers to attend. Belgian Prime Minister Spaak delivered an opening speech, saying that the establishment of a European economic alliance must be based on the needs of cooperation and sacrifice.

### Rumor that the Soviet Union Has Tested its First Atomic Bomb

(Reuters, Paris, 11th) A reporter for the Paris Evening News, reporting from Moscow via Prague, claimed that the Soviet Union's first atomic bomb was detonated in a remote area of Siberia on June 15 of this year. Present at the scene were 250 Soviet bomb experts and several government officials. The closest city to the test site was Irkutsk, 50 miles from the southern tip of Lake Baikal and 140 miles from the Outer Mongolian border. The bomb was a small one, weighing only 13 pounds, but it was fully effective, and the effects of the explosion were felt within a radius of 30 kilometers. The reporter also said that he learned from extremely confidential sources that Soviet atomic experts admitted that the Soviet Union was five years behind the United States in the manufacture of atomic bombs.

"[Reuters, London, 11th] People close to the British Foreign Office expressed skepticism about the above rumor, believing that it may be related to Soviet General MacArthur's concern before the Foreign Ministers' Conference and his concerns about US aid to China."

### The Future of the Japanese Economy Depends on the Situation in China; General MacArthur's Concern and Promises of U.S. Aid to China

(United Press, Tokyo, 11th) The United Press learned today that General MacArthur told recent visitors to Japan that Japan's political and economic future is closely related to the outcome of the ideological war in Asia. South Korea has now fallen into the hands of communist forces, and the fate of China has not yet been determined. General MacArthur acknowledged the seriousness of the situation in Asia and expressed that Soviet forces may invade southward, all the way to the coast.

The US Secretary of State's promise of aid to China will undoubtedly gain strong support from foreigners and Japanese in this area. Although Japan is currently the most peaceful country in Asia, it is gradually approaching the forefront of the turmoil in the Far East. General MacArthur and his spokespersons have recently stated that Japan's economic future depends on Asia, especially China, which is Japan's natural market. Japan must obtain sufficient foreign trade to maintain the 15% to 20% of its annual food imports that it needs, and China is the key factor in this. If the Soviet Union can control most of the Asian continent, then its position towards Japan will be equivalent to its position towards Germany in Eastern Europe. Political infiltration can be accelerated along with economic movements, and can be carried out through Japan's highly organized Communist Party spearhead.

Optimism is not Allowed in the Korean Crisis

The situation in South Korea is roughly similar, but Japan is less economically dependent on South Korea. Some diplomats here share General MacArthur's pessimism about Korea, believing that the Soviet organization in North Korea can directly reach the tip of the peninsula after the withdrawal of US troops. However, according to General MacArthur, he is convinced that America's great air force and Pacific bases can crush any attempt to invade Japan and limit Soviet forces to the mainland. General MacArthur declared that the Soviet Union had gained land in the Asian war, while the Western allies had gained the ocean, making the Pacific a military dead zone for the Soviet Union.

### India Accepts Junagadh Accession; Pakistan Protests

"[Reuters, Larel, 10th] Pakistan protested to the Indian government against the Indian military's acceptance of Junagadh State's administration."

### Drafting the German Peace Treaty Committee Issues - The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Fail to Reach Agreement - Today Discussing the Agenda for the Foreign Ministers' Conference

(Report from this newspaper) London, November 11th agricultural broadcast: The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference held its fourth meeting today. As a result of the debate, no agreement was reached on the issue of member states for the committees drafting the German peace treaty. The Soviet representative insisted that the German peace treaty should be drafted solely by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The United States, on the other hand, advocated that the four powers should include a "suitable number" of other allied countries. The efforts of Britain and France to reconcile the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union were unsuccessful. Another report states that the four-power deputy foreign ministers debated for two hours today and agreed on one point: they will begin discussing the agenda for the four-power foreign ministers' conference this Wednesday.

Public Utility Rate Hikes Again - Expected to be Implemented in Late November - Automatic Adjustment Method to be Used as Standard - Public Utility Bureau to Meet with Company Representatives Tomorrow

(Report from this newspaper) According to a responsible person from the Public Utility Bureau, speaking to a reporter yesterday: Adjustment of public utility rates is inevitable this month. Fuel, foreign exchange, and the cost of living index have all risen steadily, with the cost of living index showing the highest percentage increase, making it impossible for various public utility agencies to bear the burden. The four major companies in the city - electricity, telephone, tap water, and gas - formally submitted requests for rate increases at the beginning of this month. After careful review by the Public Utility Bureau, it was determined that they were indeed facing difficulties. If rates were not increased, it would be difficult to maintain operations. If rate increases were allowed, the burden on citizens would increase. Director Zhao has scheduled a meeting with representatives of various public utility companies tomorrow, hoping to reach a compromise on the percentage of increase.

The adjustment of public utility rates this month will use the automatic adjustment method as a standard. This method has been approved by the central government and will be implemented uniformly across the country starting from New Year's Day next year. The full text of this method will arrive in Shanghai within days, and the city's public utility rates can then be adjusted accordingly. It is estimated that the rate increase will occur in late November. According to the Public Utility Bureau, the tap water company has the most urgent need for rate adjustment because water rates were not adjusted in October. As for streetcar and bus fares, it is hoped that they can be maintained at their original prices, with increased ridership serving as a compensatory plan. There will probably be no further increase this month.

(Another report) According to Director Zhao, speaking to a reporter: Since the implementation of electricity conservation measures, citizens have achieved remarkable results in saving electricity. Moreover, the Zhongfang Company has begun generating electricity, approximately 4,500 kilowatts, so temporary power outages for factories and yarn mills have been cancelled, and industrial production is returning to normal.

A telegram had been sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense to request the United Service General Headquarters to dispatch transportation vehicles to transport the coal stored there to Shanghai, so that there would be no shortage of coal in the city.

Next, the heads of the gold and yarn groups and the food group reported on their recent work, which was generally normal. The following matters were then passed:

益記興, 義昌, 元記, 强華 and other paper companies were cleared of suspicion of hoarding and speculation, and the matter should be dismissed and the account books returned.

國華, 大華, 達豐, 唐寅記 and other four paper cutting factories, since they engage in paper cutting, should not store large quantities of paper. They are ordered to report in detail the names, occupations, and addresses of customers storing paper. Those who do not belong to formal bookstores or paper companies storing paper should be prosecuted according to the crime of hoarding.

The paper stored in 大華 paper mill is its own production and should be dismissed from discussion.

Passed the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee's request from the Coal Business Association to amend Article 4 of the Interim Management Regulations for Coal Storage in Shanghai.

The 同康信記 company at 386 Jiangxi Middle Road requested the return of the confiscated telephone, which was resolved: the return is difficult, and it will be temporarily managed.

Northern Jiangsu Refugees Seek Shelter - Jiangning Guild Hall Refuses to Accommodate - Conflict Occurs, Mediator Beaten

Recently, the number of refugees from northern Jiangsu who have fled to Shanghai has been increasing day by day. More than 20,000 people are wandering on the streets of Zhabei, which is very pitiful. Among them, about 2,000 refugees were temporarily accommodated in the five guild halls of Wujiang, Yangzhou, Jianghuai, Pingjiang, and Jiangning. However, the Jiangning Guild Hall on Moling Road expressed strong dissatisfaction and deceived more than 500 refugees who were staying in the guild hall on the 8th (previous day), causing them to be exposed on the streets for two days and nights. This group of refugees could not bear the suffering of the cold and wanted to re-enter the guild hall for accommodation, which led to a conflict with the guild hall yesterday afternoon. Wang Bing, deputy chairman of the Zhabei office of the Jianghuai Shanghai Fellow Association, acted as a mediator, but was misunderstood by the refugees and was beaten. Fortunately, he was not injured. The Zhabei Police Department was informed and Wang Zuweilv sent police officers to suppress the situation before it subsided.

Li Jingzhi, the captain of the cavalry squadron of the Municipal Police Bureau's Inspectorate, sent a letter to the Senate yesterday to defend himself after the squadron's dismissed veterinarian Liu Fengxiang accused him of deducting horse food and corruption. In his original letter, he stated that he was awaiting a thorough investigation from his superiors. He also stated that the squadron's horse food was distributed daily according to the current fixed amount and that there were books available for verification. As for the alleged deduction of 1,600 bags of horse feed in July, August, and September, he pointed out that there were a total of 160 horses stationed at the racecourse at that time, and the monthly horse feed was 500 bags. The total for three months was only 1,700 bags. The amount alleged was inaccurate. As for the accusation of "eating empty salaries," all police officers who took leave had original leave vouchers and salary books available for verification, which did not match the facts at all.

In addition, the Luobosen Road Gongda Horse Food Company issued a statement denying that it was selling horse feed to Li.

Pan's Sincere Remarks at the Celebration of the First Industrial Festival - Only by Eliminating the Communists Can the Industrial Future Have Hope

(Report from this newspaper) Yesterday, the industrial sector warmly celebrated the first Industrial Festival. All factories in the city flew flags to celebrate, and all newspapers published special editions. The Shanghai Industrial Association and various industrial trade associations held a celebration ceremony at the New World First Building at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, with the attendance of the heads of various agencies, representatives of various groups, and industrial giants, totaling more than 100 people. Hu Boxiang, Jin Runxiang, Tang Chengzong, Rong Hongyuan, Yu Mingyu, Hong Nianzu, Yan Yaoqiu, Fang Xiaofan, Dong Shuying and other nine people served as the presidium. Jin Runxiang (representing Wu Yun Chu) served as chairman and gave the opening remarks, stating briefly that this was the first Industrial Festival, which was of great significance. Its purpose was to encourage colleagues to work hard to develop the immature industry at any time and to hope that non-industrial people would participate in production. China's industry is now in urgent need of capital, talent, and social guidance. Subsequently, the heads of various agencies, guests, and representatives of the General Federation of Trade Unions gave speeches one after another, and the meal began at 12:30 p.m. and dispersed in high spirits.

Speaker Pan explained in his speech that our country now needs more factories, and small factories should be developed into large factories, so that costs can be reduced and management can be centralized. In this transitional period, we must cultivate China's fragile and meager industry and not engage in power struggles again. He also pointed out two reasons why China's industry currently feels difficult and pessimistic:

The communists are destroying peace, wars are frequent, and production is therefore hindered. We should all realize that if the communists are not eliminated, the industrial future is hopeless.

There is a deep gap between the government and the people, and they do not believe each other. The government should know that "wealth lies with the people," because the sum of the wealth of the people is the country's wealth. If you want to avoid the escape of the people's wealth and capital, you can only do so with openness and transparency. The government does not take from the people outside the law. He also pointed out painfully that China's social organization is not as good as that of foreign countries. With this system lacking organization, it is only engaged in regulation, which is not the right medicine. For example, if the allocation of cotton yarn is uneven, the result will be the opposite. Only the rule of law is the bulwark of China's emerging industry and democratic politics. Finally, he called on the industrial sector to stand up and speak out, saying that only by breaking down the gap between the government and the people and eliminating the communists can the industrial future have hope.

Wang Jiashu, on behalf of Director Wu, delivered a speech, explaining three points:

To cooperate with the government in implementing constitutional government, we must first improve our own organization. It is hoped that the organization of the Shanghai Industrial Association will be completed as soon as possible in accordance with the Industrial Association Law, so as to become a bridge between the government and the people.

The industrial sector should pay special attention to the general election and be able to participate in practical politics.

The psychological gap between labor and capital should be broken down. The capital side should improve the living standards of workers and improve workers' welfare. Workers should be educated and strictly abide by production discipline. He also emphasized that the government is determined and courageous to solve difficulties and enforce discipline, and asked the industrial sector to help the government.

Shui Xiangyun requested that labor and capital work together in the same boat, and that the industrial sector should treat workers legally and not exploit them. Working hours should also be regulated. Because the unhealthiness of workers is a loss to the industrial sector, and for the construction of the General Federation of Trade Unions, workers are requested to donate half of today's salary to the General Federation of Trade Unions. In addition, Zhou Lianze (on behalf of Fang Zhi), Zhao Zukang, Zhang Wei, Zhi Huan, and Ouyang Lun spoke one after another. Finally, the celebration unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang.

Auditing Income Tax Extorted 10 Million - Rice Shop Reported by the Guild for Prosecution - Two Auditors Tried Yesterday

(Report from this newspaper) Wang Lianlu and Hu Jinzhang, auditors of the Direct Taxation Bureau, were also tried in the District Court on suspicion of corruption. It turned out that in August of this year, the Direct Taxation Bureau implemented a sampling method for auditing the income tax of profit-making enterprises in 1941. The Yuantai Xing Rice Shop on Nanjing West Road was selected. At 9:00 a.m. on the 19th of the same month, the manager of the shop, Chen Pengfei, sent the account books to the bureau for verification. Wang and Hu were responsible for the inspection, but without careful inspection, they said that there were many errors and that it should be calculated according to last year's turnover, and that 50 million to 70 million yuan should be paid. When asked how to calculate it, Wang said that he would discuss it later. At 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, Hu Jinzhang went to the Rongkang Restaurant to wait first, and Wang then went to Yuantai Xing to ask Chen to go to Rongkang for negotiations. After bargaining, Wang and Hu said that if Chen was willing to pay 10 million yuan, the matter could be settled. Chen refused, and Wang and Hu asked Chen to send the general account table of last year to the bureau. The next morning, when Chen sent the account table to the bureau, Hu Jinzhang said again that it did not conform to the format and that he should admit that the account books did not conform and provide written proof, but Chen did not agree. At 9:00 p.m. on the 21st, Wang went to Yuantai Xing again to ask for written proof that the account books were incomplete, but was unsuccessful. They agreed to discuss it again the next morning, and he still asked for 10 million yuan. Chen had no choice but to report it to the Rice Industry Association, which was transferred by the Inspector of the Ministry of Finance to order the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau to detain Wang Lianlu and Hu Jinzhang and send them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution on corruption charges. Yesterday afternoon, Wang Jiazhuan, the judge of the 8th Criminal Court of the District Court, tried the case. Wang and Hu denied that they had gone to Yuantai Xing and Rongkang, saying that they had only been to Yuantai Xing last year to check the stamp tax account, so the staff in the shop all knew them. Then Chen Pengfei gave a detailed account of the whole process, and witnesses Wang Guanpei and Yan Liubao proved that Wang had gone to Yuantai Xing twice on August 19th and 21st. After the first visit, he asked Chen Pengfei to go out, and Chen told him before leaving, "I'm going to the Rongkang Restaurant. If anyone comes to find me, you can call me at Rongkang." Finally, after the defendant's lawyer gave a defense, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing.

Fellow Villagers of Sheng County in Shanghai Feel Unfair for Zhang Chunfan - Xiao Ling's Death Attributed to Leng Shan - Lawsuit Filed for Obstruction of Freedom

(Report from this newspaper) Yue Opera actress Xiao Danggui committed suicide, and Zhang Chunfan, who had lived with her for many years, became the target of public criticism. The District Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution against Zhang on suspicion of inciting suicide, and Zhang is now in custody. His fellow villagers expressed their indignation, believing that Leng Shan (also known as Jin Zhaoyuan), the actor and director of the Cathay Yue Opera Theatre, one of the main characters in the case, was the fuse that led to Xiao Danggui's suicide. The Sheng County Fellow Villagers Association and the family of the victim specially hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to draft a lawsuit to accuse Leng Shan of "obstructing freedom" in the District Court. There are three points listed as suspected crimes:

The lawsuit is still being polished. After visiting lawyer Mao to inquire about the results, the reporter learned that its main points included:

Leng Shan, as the director and playwright of the Cathay Yue Opera Theatre, was very familiar with Xiao Danggui and Zhang Chunfan. He was well aware of the relationship between Xiao and Zhang. However, Leng Shan admired Xiao Ling's wealth and beauty and wanted to take advantage of her. He devised a play called "Qinhuai Moon," which described a woman being forced by her circumstances and then jumping into the Qinhuai River to commit suicide. Xiao played this role. In the scene where she jumped into the river, in order to make the performance more realistic, he specially ordered Xiao to jump from a high place on the stage to the backstage. Leng Shan waited in the backstage and hugged her when she jumped down. "Qinhuai Moon" was a great success, and it was performed more than a hundred times. Leng and Xiao had intimate actions in each performance, and over time, feelings arose, which caused the feelings between them and Zhang Chunfan to deteriorate day by day. This was the first step in Leng Shan's plan to seduce Xiao Danggui.

After Leng and Xiao fell in love with each other, they immediately communicated secretly in order to connect with each other. From April to June this year, Xiao went on trips at home and abroad and returned late at night, which involved seducing the actor.

Xiao was a woman with a very old-fashioned mindset and was accustomed to playing the leading role in tragedies, which greatly affected her outlook on life. After returning from a night trip with Leng Shan on the evening of October 7, Zhang strictly questioned her. There were many rumors from the outside world, and Xiao, a weak woman, could not bear this blow, so she committed suicide the next day to seek relief. In summary, Leng Shan was guilty of kidnapping Xiao Ling. The lawsuit will be completed today, and after Zhang has reviewed and signed it, it will be delivered to the District Court tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

Around 5 PM, Foreign Minister Wang met with the Siamese Ambassador to China, Dullah Saekuraan, and it is heard that they discussed matters concerning the safety of our overseas Chinese in Siam, the existing rice supply, and the general election for merchants and civilians. The ambassador viewed the coup in his country as a revolutionary act and remained calm.

[United Press, Washington, 10th dispatch] The State Department announced today that further and more detailed reports are needed regarding the overthrow of the Siamese government before a decision can be made on whether to recognize the new government. This is because Luang Phibunsongkhram is accused of collaborating with Japan during the war.

[Reuters, Bangkok, 11th dispatch] Twenty-four hours after seizing power, Marshal Phibunsongkhram announced on the night of the 10th that Siam would revise all its obligations to foreign countries. At the same time, he appointed a 28-member military committee, with himself as the chairman, and also appointed a 20-member cabinet, with Aphaiwong as Prime Minister, who had previously served as Prime Minister when the Japanese occupied the country in 1944. Former Prime Minister Luang Thamrong and anti-Japanese leader Pridi Banomyong disappeared after the incident, presumably hiding in Bangkok. Meanwhile, the existing Regency Council has been dissolved and replaced by a Supreme State Council.

[United Press, Bangkok, 11th dispatch] The new cabinet took over administration today. Aphaiwong has assumed the post of Prime Minister for the third time in three years, with Luang Phibunsongkhram voluntarily manipulating everything from behind the scenes. The military government has decided to dissolve the parliament, draft a new constitution, and stipulate that a general election be held within ninety days. The other new cabinet ministers are as follows:

Foreign Minister: Li Ya伐卡, Finance Minister: Prince Acha扬, Minister of Justice: P拉莫, Minister of Interior: Lieutenant General錫納育哈拉, Minister of Agriculture: Prince 薛鐵豐, Minister of Propaganda: 蘇孔代.
