### Yesterday Morning's State Council Meeting Passed the "Law on Procedures for Ending Political Tutelage," Extending the Dates for Various Agencies and Councilors to Exercise Their Powers, with the National Assembly Session Still Pending a Formal Decision

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The State Council convened a meeting on the morning of the 12th, presided over in person by Chairman Chiang. In addition to reports from Wang Shijie on foreign affairs and Qin Dechun on military affairs, three important proposals were discussed: The draft "Law on Procedures for Ending Political Tutelage," also known as the handover measures, was approved and submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, to be promulgated and implemented on December 25th. The draft "Special Construction Donation Regulations" was extensively discussed and then referred to the Economic Commission for review. The terms of the current National Councilors were extended until the date of the National Assembly.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The long-debated issue of whether the National Assembly would be held as scheduled or postponed was definitively decided at the State Council meeting on the morning of the 12th. Provisions were also made regarding the exercise of powers by administrative organs after the implementation of the Constitution but before the National Assembly is held. The details of the proposal (Note: This proposal was submitted by the Chairman for discussion) are as follows: The proposal is the draft "Law on Procedures for Ending Political Tutelage." The resolution is: December 25th of this year will be the date of constitutional implementation. However, it is not yet possible to convene the National Assembly immediately. Since the Provisional Constitution has become invalid, the various organs exercising political power cannot be interrupted, nor can they lack a legal basis. Therefore, transitional measures are being drafted to bridge the gap, to be promulgated simultaneously with a formal order for the convening of the National Assembly on a fixed date, after the completion of the legislative process on December 25th. It is now deeply understood that the contents of these measures are approximately as follows:

A. The original legal powers and functions of the National Government will continue to be exercised until the President and Vice President are elected, at which point they will cease.

B. The Executive Yuan will cease to exercise its powers once the President appoints a new Premier of the Executive Yuan.

C. The Legislative Yuan will cease once a new Legislative Yuan is established. D. The original powers of the Judicial and Examination Yuans will cease once the new Constitution is in effect.

E. The Control Yuan will cease once a newly elected Control Yuan is established.

F. Various local governments and public opinion organs will cease after the new Constitution is implemented. G. These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Regarding the issue of the termination date of the National Political Council, Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the council submitted it to the State Council, which was presented for discussion and passed on the morning of the 12th. The original plan was for the National Political Council to end on December 24th of this year, but since the National Assembly has no fixed date, the council, as a public opinion institution, should be extended until the date of the establishment of the local Legislative Yuan.

### Special Construction Donation Collection: Guiding by Persuasion as a Principle, Chairman Instructs to Strive for Simplification to Avoid Harassment

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The issue of collecting a special construction donation aroused heated debate in the State Council meeting on the 12th. After Finance Minister Yu Hongjun explained, Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Xu Fulin, and others all expressed opposition, believing that the regulations were too restrictive and harsh, like regulations for punishing bandits. Subsequently, Chairman Chiang stood up and instructed that efforts should be made to simplify them to avoid harassment, and to guide by persuasion as a principle. It was decided to submit the proposal to the Government Commission's Economic Commission for review.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] After being passed by the Executive Yuan meeting, the "Special Construction Donation Regulations" were discussed at the State Council meeting on the 12th. Finance Minister Yu Hongjun first gave a detailed explanation, stating that the regulations were drafted based on the principle that during the construction period, those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. The donated wealth and goods will be based on the amount of wealth of compatriots throughout the country, and it is only a one-time donation. It is hoped that compatriots throughout the country will support this in order to complete the arduous task of construction. When Zou Lu, Zhang Ji, and Xu Fulin spoke, they all expressed dissenting opinions. Mr. Xu even said: This matter has a "deceptive" air. The regulations stipulate that people's property, whether it is immovable property such as houses, valuable jewelry of wives and children, or movable property such as domestic and foreign bank deposits, securities, and company stocks, must be declared voluntarily. The items are numerous and complicated, making it difficult to handle. Moreover, it is even more problematic for individuals to declare voluntarily. Although there are regulations to punish those who report secretly or fail to report after the deadline, it will be difficult to implement. Finally, Chairman Chiang also expressed his opinion on these regulations. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that the original proposal should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for research and revision before being submitted to the meeting again for discussion. According to the draft regulations, a progressive tax method is adopted, starting with a donation of 100 million yuan for 5 billion yuan, and the more wealth, the greater the amount donated. The last level of 500 billion yuan will donate 60% of all wealth. As for the organization in charge of this matter, the "Special Construction Donation Supervision Committee" will be established at the central level, composed of two representatives from the National Political Council, and one representative each from the Control Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and other departments, as well as political vice ministers from the financial, economic, and other relevant departments, with the Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan as the chairman. Investigation committees will be established in various provinces and cities to handle the investigation of the property of the people in each province and city.

### Exporting Surplus Materials: First Batch of Contracts Signed, Aiming to Earn Foreign Exchange

[Our dispatch] In order to accelerate the processing of surplus materials and scrap iron remaining on various islands in the Pacific, the Central China authorities recently instructed the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan to hand over unusable materials and scrap iron remaining on Lake Island, Saipan, Mariana and other 13 islands to the Central Bank, so as to re-negotiate foreign sales in order to earn foreign exchange.

The first batch of scrap iron for export was officially signed at the Central Bank on the afternoon of the 11th. This batch of scrap iron includes ships, jeeps, tanks, etc. that have already been scrapped. The tonnage and value of this batch of scrap iron have not yet been estimated, but the right to purchase this scrap iron has been obtained by the Tongyuan Trading Company, which signed the contract, and will be resold to the Bethlehem Iron Company of the United States.

This batch of scrap iron will be transported by the American Steamship Company. However, due to the large quantity, it is estimated that it can fill 100 ships. If it is shipped back and forth continuously, it will take 18 months to transport it from various islands to the east coast of the United States.

It is rumored that the batch of scrap iron weighs a total of 150,000 tons, including useful materials such as road construction machinery, and that the total value is US$30 million. Those responsible for signing the contract were unable to confirm this. However, they asserted that the batch of materials was indeed scrap iron that could no longer be used. As for the tonnage value, it can only be determined after an on-site inspection. It is reported that the Central Bank has sent personnel to various islands to investigate.

It should be noted that most of the surplus materials remaining on the Pacific islands are debts owed to our country by the United States during the war, which were transferred to our country. The U.S. government believes that our country has the right to resell a portion of these materials, and the U.S. has no right to interfere.

### The Shaanxi Luo Hui Canal Releases Water: 500,000 Acres of Fields Rely on It for Nourishment

[Central News Agency reporter Xiao Tongxin, Dali, 12th] The Shaanxi Luo Hui Canal project, planned by the late Mr. Li Yizhi, has been completed after 13 years of hard work by the water conservancy organs, and a water release ceremony was held in Yijing Village, which belongs to Dali County. Chairman Chiang, Vice Chairman Sun, President Zhang, and the central leaders all presented inscriptions. The ceremony began at 12:30 pm.

Water Conservancy Minister Xue Dubi opened the gate to release water, and Mrs. Chairman cut the ribbon. The flood of the Luo River broke out of the long Tie Lian Mountain Tunnel in this grand ceremony and rushed into the new canal. From then on, the people of Chaoyi, Dali, and Pucheng counties will no longer worry about drought, and 500,000 acres of fields will be nourished by it. According to those who are familiar with agricultural affairs, it is said that in the future, the annual output can be increased by 100,000 city stones of wheat, 75,000 city stones of beans and miscellaneous grains, and 7.5 million city catties of cotton, with a total value of approximately 152.5 billion national currency. The land itself can also increase in value by 225 billion yuan, and the annual water fee can be 6 billion yuan. The Luo Hui Canal is not the largest among the eight canals in Guanzhong, but in terms of time and scale, it is second to none among all water conservancy projects in the country. This canal was opened during the Han Dynasty, and it took 13 years, but it was not successful. History records that the Longshou Canal is this one. After 33 years of the Republic of China, it was actively built by water conservancy organs before it was completed. The total project cost reached more than 6.5 billion yuan. The total branch canal is 97,860 kilometers long, and the fifth tunnel is 3,377 meters long. The working conditions of gushing springs and quicksand were extremely difficult and dangerous. It is not easy to see its completion today. Advisor Zhao Shouyu said in his speech: Human power can overcome nature, and today's people can overcome the ancients. We should take care of ourselves in the future to ensure eternal completeness. After the ceremony, we went to the construction site to visit the arduous project, and returned to Yijing at 5:00 pm, where a meeting was held to commemorate the martyred employees.

### US House Passes Foreign Aid Bill; Final Decision to Be Made by Joint Congressional Committee; Special Aid Plan for China May Be Drafted Separately

[US Information Service, Washington, December 11] The US House of Representatives today passed the transitional aid bill for China, France, Italy, and Austria by voice vote.

The bill passed by the House will now be submitted to a conference committee of both the House and Senate for discussion in order to reconcile the differences between the two chambers and reach an agreement. According to the aid bill passed by the House, a total of $590,000,000 will be allocated, including for China, France, Italy, and Austria. However, the Senate's $597,000,000 aid bill only includes France, Italy, and Austria, excluding China. According to US regulations, whenever the two chambers find two different bills on the same issue, a committee should be established by both chambers, with each chamber having half the members, to discuss compromise methods.

The House bill will stipulate that the Export-Import Bank immediately advance $150,000,000 without waiting for further regulations to allocate the already-passed amount.

Today's debate showed that the House Appropriations Committee may cancel the $60 million relief fund for China and only grant $530,000,000 to the three European countries. The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee has obtained Zhou Yide's consent (note: Zhou advocated including a $60 million loan to China) not to include the above-mentioned $60 million loan until the government puts forward a more definite proposal for China.

[United Press, Washington, December 12] It was learned today that Senator Smith, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the committee unanimously supports Secretary of State Marshall's proposal that aid to China should be handled separately at a later date.

### Truman to Ask Congress to Allocate $300 Million in Aid to China First

[Central News Agency, Washington, December 11] According to the Washington office of Cowles Communications: Truman will ask Congress next month to allocate $300 million to aid China. At that time, a Marshall Plan for China, similar to the Marshall Plan for Europe, will appear. The State Department's China policy is currently in a state of hibernation to avoid overwhelming Congress with too many foreign aid plans at the same time. The US aid to China plan will first allocate $300 million to make up for China's trade deficit (note: the current monthly deficit is about $20 million). The next step will include military aid, which will transfer the US's remaining materials in the Far East to China, and hire American experts to train Chinese troops.

[Reuters, Washington, December 11] President Truman announced today that the message regarding the Marshall Plan for Europe will not be submitted to Congress until next week. He will also not personally present this message to Congress. It is generally believed that the President will wait until after signing the temporary aid bill before submitting the Marshall Plan.

People in Jinan and Shandong Province, and even the entire North China region, have expressed their joy at this. Indeed, we cannot ignore the restoration of this section of railway transportation. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway is a railway trunk line that runs north-south, connecting four provinces, and is a major artery extending 1,009 kilometers. Since the victory, it has been destroyed by the communist bandits and its traffic has been interrupted for as long as 25 months. This spring, the national army in Shandong Province advanced rapidly, and various places in southern Shandong were successively recovered. The emergency repair work started at any time, and after experiencing difficulties, the Jinan-Pukou section was completely repaired and officially opened to traffic. We cannot but first express our admiration to the railway authorities for their tireless efforts and hard work in emergency repairs. This emergency repair project was not easy: under the difficult conditions of scarce materials and funds, and with the added situation of the situation along the line not yet fully restored to peace, in this situation, working hard to repair the railway, and finally being able to restore the traffic between Jinan and Pukou in a short period of time, we cannot help but first express our highest admiration to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway authorities.

The restoration of railway traffic between Jinan and Pukou is still a considerable distance away from the obvious restoration of the entire Tianjin-Pukou line. Although the opening of the entire Tianjin-Pukou line still awaits a future date, we believe that there are several points that should be brought to the attention of the Chinese people due to the opening of the Pǔjì section: The opening of the Pǔjì section is a remarkable achievement. This opening shows that regardless of the destruction by the communist bandits, the government is constantly working hard to revive the economy. The government's efforts to revive and the communist bandits' destruction are in stark contrast. The Chinese people should have a new awakening about this: The opening of the Pǔjì section strengthens the relationship between North China provinces and cities such as Hebei, Shandong, and Henan and the central government, which has the effect of strengthening centripetal force. We hope that people in North China will see the opening of the Pǔjì section and be able to express their loyalty to the central government even more; Due to the opening of the Pǔjì section, materials between the north and the south can flow smoothly. On the day of the opening, there were two coal trains that transported coal produced in Shandong to Beijing and Shanghai, which will obviously have a direct effect on relieving the coal shortage in Beijing and Shanghai. In addition, other materials may also achieve the practical effect of smooth flow due to the opening of the Pǔjì section. This is of course closely related to the recovery of my country's national economy.

Due to the opening of the Pǔjì section, we hope that the entire Tianjin-Pukou line can also restore traffic in the near future. The Pǔjì section already accounts for two-thirds of the entire Tianjin-Pukou line, so the restoration of the other one-third of the traffic may be easier. However, the factors in the restoration of railway traffic are not entirely controlled by the railway authorities. How to restore the north-south trunk line of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway also depends on the cooperation of other military and political authorities and the general public. We hope that through the cooperation of the military and the people, the traffic on this north-south trunk line can be restored as soon as possible!

### Another Measure to Suppress Prices: Rationing

Following the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, various emergency measures, such as strengthening financial controls, improving the management of cotton yarn and cloth, restricting remittances, suspending lending, tightening credit, restricting cash withdrawals, strictly investigating hoarding, cracking down on price gouging, and selling off materials, are all being carried out or intensified. However, the promotion of rationing, although stipulated in the Economic Suppression of Disturbances Measures, and considered by the authorities to be an important measure to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, has not seen any action until recently. The reason for this is very obvious: to truly implement rationing, it is necessary to grasp all the materials, obtain accurate and reliable statistics, organize it on a national scale, and establish effective general and branch agencies before it can be effective.

The reasons for implementing rationing are nothing more than two points: A shortage of materials requires the total amount of all materials prepared for rationing nationwide to be planned as a whole and distributed fairly and reasonably. The emphasis is on the quantitative aspect, which is the so-called policy of equal poverty; Limiting ration prices and eradicating black markets to stabilize people's livelihood. The emphasis is on the price aspect, which is the so-called fair price policy. Therefore, if all the materials cannot be grasped, it is impossible to make an overall plan; only running it locally, without being able to run it from the national whole, there is no way to make an overall plan, without reliable national figures, there is even no way to make an overall plan; without a fully effective general and branch agency, no one can shoulder the responsibility of this overall plan.

The United States is negotiating with Congress to restore the former rationing plan. However, according to reports, the restoration work will not be completed in less than three months; this is because the scope is too large, and the preparation of materials, organizations, and figures is too complicated.

The United Kingdom is also implementing comprehensive rationing. The food item alone requires nearly 400 million pounds to be subsidized from the national treasury every year. This is because in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, subsidies must be provided. It is also a country that relies on immediate food supplies, and the state has to find ways to import food to distribute. Otherwise, its lowest fixed amount cannot be maintained, the black market will inevitably be rampant, and may even endanger its rationing system itself.

Based on these examples above, we can know that: Simply implementing local rationing cannot grasp all the materials, and can definitely not eliminate the black market or stabilize prices; Within the same region, only implementing partial rationing, ignoring the rest, cannot grasp all the materials, which means that it is fundamentally impossible to eliminate the black market or stabilize prices; If the rationed amount of the part being rationed is too low to maintain its minimum needs, or if its period is too inaccurate to supply its regularly necessary consumption, it is tantamount to encouraging the black market and creating a black market; Whether it is comprehensive rationing or local rationing, if its ration price must be adjusted according to the cost, without preparing to subsidize it, then the original intention of stabilizing prices cannot be realized; When materials are too scarce, it is not enough to start with dredging sources, but only to limit the existing materials that can be obtained in front of you, it is definitely not enough to maintain its fixed amount and fixed period; If the objects being rationed and the agencies handling it are too simple and crude, it will inevitably weaken the effect of its rationing.

Currently, the only rationing being implemented, apart from the in-kind rationing for civil servants and teachers, is limited to Shanghai, and only to a certain part of Shanghai. Although the people handling it have made their best efforts, the various conditions mentioned above have not been fully met; its greatest achievement can only be to provide special benefits to a certain group of people, that is, the people who get the ration can get a certain fair-priced item. If the amount of goods is not enough, they still have to seek it on the black market. All those who cannot enjoy this special benefit have to seek it on the black market, and of course there is no such thing as fair-priced goods in places where rationing is not implemented. The result is that not only is the surplus or deficit of materials unequal in various places, but even within the same region, there is a great difference; The rising tide of prices, the activity of speculation, and the instability of people's livelihood have never been thoroughly stopped. Still taking Shanghai as an example: rice is partially rationed, but the rice market is still crazy; sugar is universally rationed, but in addition to the ration price and negotiated price, the black market is still rampant. Other things such as coal briquettes, cooking oil, rayon, cotton yarn, etc., all have their different forms of sale or rationing, and all have their various black markets. This is not necessarily because the rationing is not effective, nor is it necessarily because the crackdown and investigation are not strict, but it is really because the plan is not thorough and there are too many loopholes.

But seeing the prevalence of rationing systems in various countries, and the re-emergence of the old tune in the United States, we can know that this system is indeed the most reasonable and effective way to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood. However, in our view, if you cut corners and do it piecemeal, it is definitely ineffective. Therefore, the promotion of the rationing system, which has been delayed in implementation, and has not seen actual implementation, does not need to be anxious or disappointed. It is said that the central government, in order to implement rationing, had the idea of hiring British experts. Yesterday's Central News Agency news said that Mr. Hurt, Assistant Secretary of the British Ministry of Food, will come to China as a consultant for the Ministry of Food. It can be seen that in the future, the central government may take further steps and adopt a meticulous and systematic method in handling rationing, in order to achieve the purpose of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood. We have seen that there are now many hasty and random medical treatments, which are causing chaos in the economic world to sink deeper and deeper. We cannot help but place deep expectations on this fundamental improvement preparation work.

### Japanese Reparations Machine Tools Awaiting Transport

(Continued from Page 1) Important decisions of the Reparations Committee are as follows:

1. Passed the plan for receiving and transporting Japanese reparations materials. The main points are to determine the receiving agencies and the work that each agency should prepare: The ship loading and transportation work on the Japanese port side will be handled by the Receiving Committee of the Mission to Japan. On the Chinese port side: A. The ministries and commissions receiving the materials will set up receiving agencies. B. The Transportation Office for Reparations Materials of the Ministry of Communications will establish an office. C. It is stipulated that each port will hold a joint conference for receiving and transporting reparations materials, with the participation of the heads of the above-mentioned agencies, and presided over by the representative of the Supervising and Transportation Committee stationed in the port.

2. Passed the exchange procedures for Japanese reparations materials in the port, so as to avoid temporary chaos.

3. Japanese reparations materials are transported to many ports in our country, but most of them are still transported to Shanghai as the final destination. The first batch of ships carrying reparations materials is also determined to arrive in Shanghai, so the preparatory work in Shanghai is particularly important. The preparations are as follows: All ministries and commissions have set up receiving agencies in Shanghai, which have been handled by the ministries and commissions. The Shanghai office of the Transportation Office for Japanese Reparations Materials of the Ministry of Communications is concurrently held by Mr. Hú Shíyuān, Deputy Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The Shanghai Joint Transportation Conference will be convened every Wednesday by Mr. Hú Shíyuān, Deputy Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, who is hired by the Supervising and Transportation Committee of the Reparations Committee as the representative stationed in Shanghai. The heads of the receiving agencies of various departments in Shanghai will hold liaison meetings. The preparatory work of various ministries and commissions in Shanghai has been basically completed. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has pre-scheduled two ships, "Hǎikāng" and "Hǎizhè," to go to Japan to receive and transport the materials, and the Reparations Committee has telegraphed the situation of the two ships to the Mission to Japan to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters on entry procedures in the vicinity. As soon as the telegram granting entry arrives, they can immediately sail to Japan. The import of reparations materials has been approved by the Executive Yuan to issue a general license and exempt them from taxes. All the procedures to be handled have also been negotiated separately. According to the above-mentioned preparations, if the crating work proceeds quickly, the first batch of 9,449 machine tools can be transported within two months. The first batch of ships to transport Japanese reparations materials can arrive in Shanghai within this month.

### Personnel of the "Liberation Headquarters" in Shanghai Flew to Tianjin Yesterday and Transferred to Communist Areas

[Our Newspaper] In addition to the sudden disappearance of Director Lín Zhòng, the other five personnel of the Shanghai Office of the Communist Party of China's "Liberation Headquarters" who were withdrawing as agreed, took a Civil Air Transport plane to Tianjin yesterday morning and transferred back to the Communist area.

Regarding Lín Zhòng's actions, the Civil Air Transport issued a statement yesterday, stating that it would no longer be responsible for his safety, saying, "According to the agreement, after the closure of the 'Liberation Headquarters' office, all personnel of the office should be escorted safely back to the Communist area. However, Representative Lín suddenly went elsewhere on his own, and sent a letter to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration before leaving, saying that he would go directly to Hong Kong, which is obviously a violation of the agreement. The responsibility of this office for the safety of Mr. Lín's actions no longer exists due to his breach of contract."

In addition, a spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration told reporters that Lín Zhòng did not fly to Tianjin and return to the Communist area together because he sent a letter to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, claiming that he "voluntarily" did not go. Therefore, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is also not responsible for his future safety issues. As for the seven staff members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the Communist area, according to the agreement between the two parties, they can also return south after the personnel of the "Liberation Headquarters" withdraw. This agreement should not be affected by Lín Zhòng's personal "voluntary" non-return. As for when these seven people will return to Shanghai, it should be decided by them, because they may be willing to withdraw after the work is completed.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, December 12] The five personnel of the "Liberation Headquarters," Jì Fēng and others, arrived in Tianjin from Shanghai at 11:00 AM on the 12th and will be repatriated to the Communist area together with the personnel of the "Liberation Headquarters" in Tianjin within days.

### Nearly 100 Personnel of the Civil Air Transport Lost or Detained in Communist Areas

[Our Newspaper] There are now brief statistics on the personnel losses of the Civil Air Transport in the Communist-controlled areas. It is reported that six employees of the Civil Air Transport lost their lives while engaged in relief work in the Communist-controlled areas, two were injured by Communist gunfire, two are missing, and as many as 80 employees of the Civil Air Transport are still being detained in the Communist area and have not been released, including more than 50 truck drivers transporting relief supplies.

The incidents occurred mostly in the battle zones of North China. The Henan Branch of the Civil Air Transport had the most employees detained by the Communists. Since the branch started working in Henan, many employees have been lost in Kaifeng, Xuchang, Zhoukou, Fugou and other places. The Civil Air Transport will soon publish a detailed report on its total personnel losses.

### Three Branches of the Civil Air Transport Closed; Head Office to Lay Off Large Numbers of Employees Within the Month

[Our Newspaper] Branches of the Civil Air Transport in various places have recently closed down one after another. In the past week, the Guangxi, Shandong-Qingdao, and Shanxi-Chahar-Suiyuan branches have been closed. In addition to carrying out various work-relief projects such as road construction, dike repair, and agricultural reclamation, the three branches also widely established people's canteens, porridge shops, milk stations, shelters, and repatriation stations in their jurisdictions to provide emergency relief to starving refugees. When the work of the three branches was at its busiest, the number of employees would be as high as 1,240. Most of the personnel have now been laid off, leaving only a few to handle the closure.

In addition, the Shanghai office of the Civil Air Transport will lay off more than half of its personnel within this month. Some personnel may be transferred to work in the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission established after the Civil Air Transport Allied Headquarters is closed.

[Our City] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration announced that from November 1945 to December 5, 1948, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration transported a total of 2,371,630 long tons of materials to China, a total of 1,055 ships carrying goods to China, and a total of 96 planes carrying goods. Most of the relief supplies transported to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration were food and equipment for industry, agriculture, and transportation.

### Case of the Murder of Qí Xuéqǐ, Former Deputy Commander of the 38th Division

Two Main Culprits to Be Executed Today

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, December 12] Qí Xuéqǐ, former Deputy Commander of the 38th Division of the New First Army stationed in India and Burma, was stabbed to death on July 9, 1945, in the Yangon concentration camp by Zhāng Jíxiáng, a driver, and ten others who were also detained in the same place. Relevant authorities informed our newspaper reporter today that the date has been set, and the two main culprits, Zhāng Jíxiáng and others, will be executed by firing squad on the morning of the 13th. It is reported that after Zhāng and others were captured, they were weak-willed and attempted to surrender. Because Qí firmly opposed it, Zhāng held a sharp knife in the middle of the night, ambushed beside the staircase on the second floor of the concentration camp, and assassinated Qí when he went upstairs. After the victory, Zhāng fled to Kunming and surrendered to the Yunnan Police Headquarters. The other nine people were arrested one after another. Zhāng was sentenced to ten years in prison. Later, the Military Affairs Commission returned the case for a retrial, and Zhāng was sentenced to death. The others were acquitted. Zhāng refused to accept the sentence and submitted a petition to the Ministry of National Defense, claiming that ten people committed the crime at the same time and the sentence was unfair, and falsely accused the Chief of Military Law Section and Judge of the Yunnan Garrison Headquarters of accepting bribes. The Ministry of National Defense considered the case to be complicated and ordered the Chongqing Executive Headquarters to conduct a trial in early September. Now that the truth has come out, a certain section chief and judge have also been declared innocent and released.

### Government Takes Various Measures, Commodity Prices Generally Decline in Various Regions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] After the issuance of banknotes worth 10,000 yuan or more, there has been no significant fluctuation in commodity prices in Nanjing. This is due to the appropriate handling by the government in advance, such as the decision by the Joint Treasury to stop lending by national banks and vigorously tighten the currency supply. Although large banknotes have been issued, the money supply in the market remains tight. At the same time, the establishment of financial management bureaus in various important cities will strictly inspect commercial banks and money houses that engage in speculation and hoarding. Once discovered, they will be shut down and severely punished. Therefore, the aforementioned speculative banks and money houses do not dare to act rashly or easily take advantage. Moreover, the government has decided to establish a Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee to control cotton yarn and cloth and implement the government's policies of entrusted spinning and weaving, unified purchasing and unified sales, to stabilize prices. The government also plans to implement a comprehensive rationing system for six daily necessities in the short term to stabilize the prices of daily necessities for the people. Therefore, commodity prices can be expected to achieve considerable stability in the near future.

[Our newspaper's Chengdu dispatch, 12th] The price fluctuations in Chengdu caused by the issuance of large banknotes have been strictly suppressed by the provincial and municipal governments, and prices have begun to decline on the 11th and 12th. On the 12th, cotton yarn, fabrics, general merchandise, cigarettes, and grain all fell by 10%, and the money supply has not loosened.

[Our newspaper's Hankou dispatch, 12th] Since the news of the issuance of large banknotes spread, the markets in the three towns (of Wuhan) were once chaotic. After the Municipal Police Department arrested 49 merchants who took the opportunity to raise prices, commodity prices have begun to decline today.

[Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch, 12th] On the 11th, there was a rush to buy goods in the city of Taiyuan. Except for grain and flour, which remain tight, everything else is normal. The discount rate is 80 yuan per yuan within banks and 90 yuan outside banks. Although grain and flour have reached unprecedented high prices, there is no major impact on the lives of citizens because of the cooperative system of the common people's economy. Citizens can buy a two-day supply of white flour at a price of 5,400 yuan per jin (a unit of weight), and sorghum flour at a price of 2,400 yuan per jin. Those who have not joined the cooperative can also buy sorghum flour at a slightly higher price of 3,500 yuan per jin.

[Our newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 12th] The Beiping Municipal Police Department, under the order of the municipal government, mobilized criminal police officers to form a temporary economic inspection team. Today, they went to the city to conduct spot checks on various grain stores and grain depots, strictly monitoring their transactions, and inspecting the black market for gold and foreign currency, continuing to arrest many "gold devils" (currency speculators). The activities of unscrupulous merchants have been suppressed. Commodity prices are fluctuating, but grain prices remain firm. Today, the Joint Treasury's Beiping office held a meeting and decided to start lending 50 billion yuan in grain loans.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 12th] The money supply in Qingdao's market is even tighter today, and affected by the Shanghai market, the prices of various goods have generally fallen. 32-count Silver Moon yarn fell by 7 million yuan, Dasuanglong cloth fell by 50,000 yuan, and flour flooded the market, falling to 450,000 yuan per bag. Rice fell to 950,000 yuan per hundred liters. The police department has also formulated four measures to strictly deal with the black market trading of US dollars.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] The exchange rate of the Bank of China has changed, and the black market price of gold and foreign currency continues to fall. The price of rice fell today, with top-quality rice selling for 970,000 yuan per dan.

[Our newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, 12th] Yesterday, affected by the issuance of large banknotes, commodity prices in Hangzhou fluctuated, but have slightly recovered today. Only the price of rice is still rising. After the grain market opened yesterday, there was a fight due to supply exceeding demand, which was quelled by military police. Because of the impact of the two previous rice rushes, the common people are scrambling to buy rice. The price of white japonica rice on the market has reached 860,000 yuan, peaking at 900,000 yuan. The place of origin has reported a price drop today, and it is predicted that the Hangzhou market will stabilize tomorrow.

### Four Foreign Ministers Reach Preliminary Agreement; Agree to Increase German Steel Production Level; Deadline for Allied Control Council to Publish List of Dismantled Factory Equipment

[Our dispatch] London, 12th Broadcast: According to Soviet sources, if the Foreign Ministers' Conference can immediately decide on the establishment of an overall economic and administrative organization for Germany, Mr. Molotov may agree to temporarily postpone the demand for $10 billion in reparations from Germany.

[Reuters, London, 11th] Today's Foreign Ministers' Conference, chaired by Mr. Marshall, was the most successful since the beginning of this session. The four foreign ministers have reached an agreement on the following three items: increasing Germany's steel production level to 11.5 million tons per year; revising Germany's industrial level; and the deadline for submitting the list of factories to be dismantled and shipped. In addition, the four foreign ministers agreed to discuss the Soviet proposal to establish a central economic organization for Germany. However, the issue of reparations was not discussed at today's meeting. Regarding the British proposal to dissolve German monopoly enterprises, the United States and France submitted amendments yesterday. After discussion today, a complete agreement was reached on the full text of the proposal. Regarding the first item, Mr. Bidault made concessions during the discussion, stating that France never intended to deprive the German people of their normal economic level. Their only concerns were security issues and the special status of the Ruhr. He would reserve these two points for future discussion. As a result, the four foreign ministers agreed to the amount proposed by Mr. Bevin. Regarding the issue of industrial levels, the UK proposed gradually restoring German industry, especially establishing a close link between coal exports and steel production. France suggested that the increase in German industrial activity should ensure that it does not take precedence over the recovery of European democratic countries. As a result, the UK, the US, and France all agreed to the principle of gradual recovery, while Mr. Molotov stated that he would reserve his position. During the discussion on the dismantling of German industrial equipment, France and the Soviet Union insisted that it should include the transfer of machine tools as reparations, while Mr. Bevin strongly opposed it. As a result, Mr. Marshall suggested that the drafting committee re-draft the proposal with reference to the positions of the UK and France. Regarding the dismantling issue, Mr. Bevin advocated not setting a deadline, while Mr. Molotov strongly advocated setting a deadline. As a result, it was agreed to limit the Allied Control Council to publish the final list of factory equipment to be dismantled by April 15, 1948. Regarding the elimination of Germany's essential military industries, it was resolved to hand this issue over to the drafting committee to draft a proposal.

### Rejecting Soviet Protests Again, France Sends Strong Note, Accusing Soviet Nationals of Inciting French Citizens to Flee

[United Press, Paris, 11th] The French government sent a strong note to the Soviet Union on the 11th, rejecting the Soviet protest against the French military's attack on a Soviet expatriate concentration camp near Paris on November 14. The note pointed out that the anti-Soviet activities of the people in the concentration camp, without the permission of the French government, were a low-level organization inciting escape.

The note pointed out that approximately 60 French men and women fled to the Soviet Union from there. After arriving in the Soviet Union, they requested France to send them back, and their departure to the Soviet Union was not voluntary. Soviet-French relations now seem to be continuing to deteriorate. Some officials expect that the Soviet Union may announce the abrogation of the Soviet-French Treaty of Mutual Assistance.

[United Press, Paris, 11th] It is generally believed that there are between 20,000 and 30,000 French citizens awaiting repatriation in the Soviet Union, most of whom were captured with the German army. Officials said that the French embassy in the Soviet Union will continue to search for their whereabouts after the expulsion of the dispersal group. Soviet citizens and German prisoner-of-war camp officials have made it difficult to find French citizens.

### Mr. Marshall's Speech Praises Close UK-US Relations

[Our dispatch] London, 12th Broadcast: Today, the English Association of Teachers hosted a banquet to entertain Secretary of State Marshall. During the banquet, Mr. Marshall gave a speech, praising the "close relationship" between the UK and the US, believing that this relationship is beneficial to both countries, because what the UK and the US pursue are not narrow doctrines, but the creed of freedom. Mr. Marshall did not mention the Soviet Union, but his vigorous praise of UK-US relations sufficiently contrasted with the unsatisfactory relationship between the two major Western powers and the Soviet Union. However, Mr. Marshall indirectly refuted the Soviet Union's accusation that the UK and the US have ulterior motives.

### Armed Police Block Violent Acts; Rome Labor Strike Weakens; Expected to End Within Days

[United Press, Rome, 12th] Since the Italian Communist Party launched the general strike in Rome, it has been on the verge of failure on the 12th. The Communist Party was greatly anxious and launched violent groups to deal with various industries that were operating as usual. The violent groups moved around everywhere. At the same time, banks, stores, securities firms, and Catholic schools joined the anti-strike movement, and the number of people increased. Thousands of policemen drove quickly back and forth in the city to prevent the actions of violent groups.

The city's labor union, controlled by the Communist Party, was not very enthusiastic about negotiating with the government in the past. On the morning of the 12th, it announced that its representatives were willing to resume negotiations with Prime Minister De Gasperi. However, the executive committee of the labor union waited for a long time without a response. The Italian Communist labor leader, Vittorio, finally called Labor Minister Fanfani to discuss the matter. The two then held a meeting. People in the city's labor union predict that the strike will be canceled on the 12th or 13th.

[United Press, Rome, 11th] Three regiments of the army entered Rome today to help the police maintain order during the general strike.

[United Press, Rome, 11th] Italian labor leader and Communist member Vittorio has ordered 500,000 workers in Rome to continue the strike on the 12th, and threatened a nationwide general strike to protest the government's rejection of labor demands. Prime Minister De Gasperi then took measures similar to those of France, gathering the army and navy, fully armed, and using box cannons, tear gas, and hand grenades to protect the "right to work."

### UK to Abandon Trusteeship of Holy Land Around Mid-May of Next Year; Declares Unwillingness to Participate in Implementing Partition

[Our dispatch] London, 12th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin told the House of Commons today that if negotiations between the UK and the United Nations proceed quickly, the UK may abandon its trusteeship of the Holy Land before May 15. The 70,000 British troops currently stationed in the Holy Land will also be withdrawn at an accelerated pace. According to the current timetable, British troops will be completely withdrawn before August 1 of next year.

Mr. Bevin said that British troops will not participate in assisting the partition of the Holy Land, and even if the United Nations asks the UK to participate in this matter, it is unwilling to accept this task.

### New UK-Soviet Trade Agreement to be Signed Within Ten Days

[Our dispatch] London, 12th Broadcast: Rumors that the UK may cancel bread rationing after the signing of the new UK-Soviet trade agreement have been denied by authoritative government sources, because the several categories of goods that the Soviet Union has agreed to supply to the UK do not include wheat.

[Reuters, London, 12th] After the UK-Soviet trade agreement is formally signed within a week to ten days, approximately one million tons of Soviet grain will be imported into the UK starting next year. Mr. Stansgate or London's statement last night did not involve exact figures, because the drafting work still requires a week to ten days before the signing. However, authoritative sources revealed that the amount of coarse grains supplied to the UK by the Soviet Union will exceed the total of 500,000 tons of all coarse grains imported by the UK from various countries last year. The shipping date is approximately in January or February of next year, and it will take until August or September of the same year to complete the transportation. The UK will transport sawmill equipment, tunnel railway equipment, and heavy electrical equipment to the Soviet Union. The loading and unloading ports in the Soviet Union will be ports on the Black Sea. British Minister of Commerce Wilson announced the establishment of the trade agreement to the House of Commons yesterday, saying that the price paid by Mr. Jowitt was still good.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 11th, United Press] Soviet archaeologists have announced that they have discovered two 2,000-year-old corpses, one of a young woman and the other of her male companion, both of which are in perfect condition. The 2,000-year-old corpses were discovered in a looted tomb in the Altai Mountains of southwestern Siberia. The climate there is extremely cold, so neither corpse has decayed. Offerings of dried cheese and other foods are still fresh and edible next to the corpses. It is said that the young woman has a beautiful face and apparently died of illness, but her male companion was killed. The intention was probably to ensure that the young woman would not be lonely after death.

### Year-End Bonus Method Passed; Based on One Month's Salary in Principle, Calculated According to the Current Month's Index; If Dispute Mediation Fails, the Arbitration Committee Will Judge

[Our dispatch] The city's method for factories and businesses to pay year-end bonuses this year was drafted after the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the General Labor Union, and China Textile Construction Company to study the matter in detail. It was passed by the Municipal Government Conference yesterday, and the contents are as follows: The year-end bonus for 1947 is, in principle, one month's salary. Factories and businesses that are unable to afford it due to poor business performance may shorten it. Those that have suffered losses due to poor business performance, after verification, may not pay it. Factories and businesses may negotiate the aforementioned bonuses with the labor side based on their business conditions. Piece-rate workers in factories, except for temporary employees, should be handled in accordance with the aforementioned regulations. Temporary workers should still be handled according to last year's precedent. The employees of public utility enterprises should still be handled according to precedent by the competent authority. Employees who have not worked for a full year should have their bonuses reduced proportionally based on their months of service, but it should not be less than one-twelfth. Year-end bonuses should be calculated based on the cost of living index for the month in which they are paid, but if there is a custom, the custom should be followed. If factories and businesses have economic difficulties, they may pay the aforementioned bonuses in installments. If disputes arise between factories and businesses due to the payment of bonuses, they should apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation in accordance with the law. If mediation fails, they should immediately submit the matter to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for arbitration. After the arbitration, neither the labor nor the management side may object. During the mediation or arbitration period, neither side may engage in any illegal behavior.

### Cotton Mill Workers in Two Districts Petition for Year-End Bonus

Mr. Wang stated the difficulties of various yarn mills this year and said that both sides could send representatives to continue discussing the year-end bonus issue. In the afternoon, dozens of worker representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Chief of the Labor Affairs Department Shen Ding received them and stated that the year-end bonus of half a month was only the opinion of the management side and not a definitive figure.

### Fresh Fish Dumping Dispute: Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Arrives in Shanghai Today to Discuss Solutions with Both Parties

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the dispute between the city's fish market and the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) over unloading fish, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng will arrive today to discuss solutions with both parties. Zuo was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but due to an important meeting in Nanjing, he was unable to leave and instead departed from Nanjing by overnight train yesterday, arriving in Shanghai this morning. According to an UNRRA spokesperson who spoke to reporters: The report that Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng will come to Shanghai to "mediate" the dispute between the fish market and UNRRA over unloading fish is inappropriate. This matter does not require "mediation." UNRRA's purpose in bringing in large quantities of fish is to assist the Chinese government in suppressing fish prices, so that ordinary people can have fish to eat, and to alleviate some of the material shortages. We cannot allow the reduced profits of a small number of fishermen to affect the living burden of the majority of the people. Therefore, UNRRA insists that every fish caught must be supplied to the people.

Regarding UNRRA's allocation of fishing vessels, the spokesperson stated that UNRRA cannot temporarily sell fishing vessels to fishermen because there is a lack of Chinese technical personnel to operate the new-style vessels. There are no other reasons. The Fishery Management Office is actively training 253 young technical personnel to operate the various machines on the 126 new-style fishing vessels. They are studying diligently and achieving satisfactory results. Once the training period is complete, they will be allocated to fishermen along with the new fishing vessels. The 180 foreign personnel who previously taught technical personnel at the Fuxing Island Fishery Management Office are gradually returning to their countries. By January 1 of next year, only 50 personnel are planned to remain at the Fishery Management Office, which is under the control of the Post-War Relief Committee. Currently, there are 685 Chinese personnel working on fishing vessels and as mechanical staff. UNRRA has allocated US$26 million to train Chinese fishery personnel and revitalize China's fisheries.

### Fishery Representatives Petition Against UNRRA Dumping

Local private fishery businesses complain that UNRRA is using relief fishing vessels to fish in Chinese territorial waters and dump the catch in Shanghai, causing fish prices to plummet.

Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, representatives from various private fishery companies petitioned the Fishery Development Research Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, submitting a written appeal.

### Zhao Junmai Assumes Post as Director of the UNRRA Fishery Management Office Yesterday

### Pig, Cattle, and Sheep Industry Petitions the City Council: Inspection Methods Are Not Entirely Appropriate

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Fresh Pig Business Association, Pig Trade Business Association, Cattle and Sheep Business Association, and other five groups, as well as representatives of fresh pig traders, jointly petitioned the Shanghai City Council yesterday. They stated that the livestock slaughter inspection methods announced by the Health Bureau, scheduled to be implemented on December 1, are not entirely appropriate in content and are difficult to implement. Therefore, they requested that the council forward a letter to the authorities to revise and halt the methods. They stated two reasons: The safety of pork, beef, and mutton is related to the health of citizens. Therefore, the meat must be inspected by a veterinarian after slaughter before it can be sold in the market. This post-slaughter inspection is very reasonable. However, the methods require an additional inspection before slaughter, which duplicates work and increases the risk of livestock injury when there is a surge in supply. Pre-slaughter inspection was implemented before the war due to the lack of unified administration in the concessions. Now that Shanghai's administration is unified, there is no need for duplicate procedures. According to Article 5 of the methods, dead livestock will be handed over to the diseased livestock processing plant, and a price of 30,000 yuan will be paid per head. The processing plant can earn 850,000 yuan. Such a measure is unreasonable and puts merchants at too great a disadvantage. According to information obtained by reporters from the City Council, pig traders had previously complained about the drawbacks of implementing pre-slaughter inspection in Shanghai. For example, the staff employed by the processing plant would obstruct and forcibly inspect livestock that were not diseased before a veterinarian had legally certified them. The council has forwarded a letter to the Health Bureau to investigate and verify the situation, but has not yet received a response. The council has not yet received the city government's letter to review the livestock slaughter inspection methods.

### Pork Has Nothing to Do With Thrift: 80,000 Pigs Slaughtered Monthly

### Over a Hundred Railway Spikes Loose: Shanghai-Hangzhou Line Passenger Train Delayed

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Hangzhou Line's upward-bound ordinary passenger train No. 42 for second and third class passengers arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 5:00 PM, delayed by four hours and forty-five minutes. Train No. 24 was delayed by four hours. This was because at approximately 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a track inspection crew discovered that over a hundred railway spikes were loosened not far from the Hangzhou station, so they telegraphed the Hangzhou station to stop the train's departure and immediately began repairs. The repairs were completed at approximately 8:00 AM, so the Jinling Express was able to depart on time. The truth was unclear for a time, causing widespread suspicion. After the Police Department, along with the Engineering Department and the Hangzhou station, thoroughly investigated, it was discovered that the No. 27 express train for first and second class passengers, which departed from Shanghai for Hangzhou at 10:45 PM the previous evening, had an additional locomotive attached to it for standby use in Hangzhou. When it was passing the Jianqiao station at approximately 3:00 AM yesterday morning and about to arrive in Hangzhou, the attached locomotive suddenly experienced a malfunction, shifting a section of the steel rail and loosening over a hundred railway spikes. Because it was late at night and drizzling at the time, it was not discovered at the time.

### Impersonating Female Judge Case: Zhu Huangfangbai Fined 50,000 Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Zhu Huangfangbai, who was accused of impersonating a female judge, was sentenced yesterday morning by Judge Zhu Yuhuang in the Ninth Criminal Court. The main text of the judgment reads:

"Zhu Huangfangbai is publicly punished with a fine of 50,000 yuan for openly using the title of a public official." Zhu Huangfangbai was sitting alone in the Venus Dance Hall on June 28, sipping tea when Zhou Jiahua and others suspected her of being a dancer and asked her to dance. Zhu considered it an insult, and a conflict arose in their words. The Songshan Police Station mediated the matter. However, Zhu had claimed to be a judge of the court, which caught the attention of Cha Liangjian, the president of the court. However, Cha found that there was no such person in the court, so he sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate and prosecute her.

### Tax Bureau Official Embezzlement Case: Five Defendants Sentenced to Five Years; Miao Boyan and Zhang Baonian Declared Not Guilty

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Gao Shijie, an auditor of the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, and ten others accused of embezzlement, was sentenced yesterday in the District Court. After Judge Hu Zhichao ascended to the Third Criminal Court, all seven defendants except the three who were at large were present to hear the judgment. Judge Hu stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yu Maojie, and Yang Renzheng are each sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights for jointly using their positions to fraudulently obtain property without success. Zou Wenlong is sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights for helping in the fraud. Miao Boyan and Zhang Baonian are both innocent." He then sat down and briefly stated the reasons for the judgment: When the defendants were investigating whether various businesses had evaded taxes, they did not act in accordance with the tax bureau's regulations. The tax bureau's regulations stipulate that the maximum fine for tax-evading businesses is 25 million yuan. Based on the tax evasion situation of Zhang Wantai Company, it should be fined 10 million yuan. However, the defendants demanded 70 to 80 million yuan to 100 million yuan from the various woodware companies. Their attempt to extort money is very obvious. Regarding Zou Wenlong's part, it was found that a woodware merchant asked Zheng Gongda, an official of the Tax Bureau, to come forward to negotiate, and Zheng then transferred the matter to Zou Wenlong for negotiation. After Zou obtained the bribe, he transferred it to his own account. The evidence of malpractice is conclusive. Tax Bureau Supervisor Miao Boyan was only responsible for investigation, and Zhang Baonian did not participate in the solicitation of bribes, so they cannot be convicted of embezzlement. Therefore, they are found not guilty. After the sentencing, Miao Boyan remained on his original bail, Zhang Baonian was granted bail, and the remaining defendants were returned to custody.

### Dachang Airport Warehouse Completed; Bank Manager Sells Family Property to Compensate

[Report from Our Newspaper] The construction of the warehouse at Dachang Airport was tendered last year and contracted by the Lu Chuang Construction Company for 1.5 billion yuan.

Liu Dejian, Director of the Zhabei District Health Office, chaired yesterday's reception and first explained that the residents are public education personnel who returned to Shanghai from the rear. The houses they currently live in were allocated to them. Given the severe housing shortage in Shanghai, they are currently unable to move or purchase housing. If the China Trust Bureau implements the sales policy, more than 100,000 people will be displaced, which will affect social stability. What the residents are currently fighting for is the right to use the property, and they do not oppose the government's policy. The organization of the Friendship Association has absolutely no political or party background.

Establishing Custody Agreements is a Unilateral Constraint

Then, three questions were raised: What is the difference between the rent and the custody fee collected by the China Trust Bureau? What major assistance does the sales policy provide to finance, and are there any alternative solutions? The enemy property sales policy has been changed repeatedly. Please study and provide opinions to the attendees. After the discussion began, resident representatives expressed their views. The main points were: The custody fee has no legal basis, so its nature is no different from rent. Initially, the China Trust Bureau required residents to sign a "custody agreement," stating that the property could be recovered at any time and collecting a usage fee instead of rent. This is a unilateral constraint. In principle, residents are acting as custodians of enemy property for the China Trust Bureau and should not have to pay a usage fee. It is not in line with Shanghai's general customs that they pay a fee similar to rent and yet the rental rights are not guaranteed.

Residents' Right of Use Should Still Be Retained

If more than 100,000 residents are forced to move within a month, it will have a major impact on social stability and will further exacerbate the city's housing shortage. Therefore, it is hoped that the government can change its approach, postpone the sale, or separate the sale rights from the usage rights. Enemy property can be sold, but residents should retain the right to use the property. Change the current sales policy to give residents priority in purchasing. If residents cannot afford it, the status quo should be maintained. However, in order to increase financial revenue, it may be possible to reasonably increase the security deposit and rent. If the enemy and puppet housing is sold to increase the national treasury, the building of the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund and the residences of important figures in the French Concession should be sold first, and the focus should not be on the alley houses in the Hongkou District, otherwise it would be unfair.

No Supplement to Finance Appeal to the Executive Yuan

Zhou Yizhi, a lawyer, contributed his opinion, believing that the Friendship Association should submit a petition to the Executive Yuan before the China Trust Bureau implements the policy. He also pointed out that the spirit of the Housing Leasing Regulations promulgated by the Legislative Yuan on the first of this month is to protect residents, and the vast majority of enemy property residents are public education personnel who returned from the rear. They followed the government westward during the war and endured hardship. They should now be protected by the government. Duanmu Kai, a lawyer, continued to speak, saying that in addition to the public relationship between the government and the people, they should be on an equal footing in private. If the people live in enemy houses and government agencies live in enemy houses, the same methods should be used in handling them to be fair. When Wu Chengxi spoke, he opposed the current policy, believing that it would not provide much financial assistance, whether for industry or housing. In the past, enemy and puppet industries should have been operated by the state and not sold separately, which would only benefit the wealthy. As for the sale of enemy housing, it is unnecessary because the occupied value of enemy housing in the first half of this year was only 200 billion to 300 billion yuan, and today it is at most 1 trillion yuan. The government's monthly expenditure is currently 5 trillion, which is only one week's worth of use. Therefore, it is better to increase the rent moderately than to sell it. The discussion had gone on for more than five hours. The chairman first thanked the attendees and summarized the various issues, stating that he would appeal to the Executive Yuan immediately, and then announced the adjournment of the meeting.

Although the China Trade Bank negotiated several times, it had no effect. Lu Yunsheng of Shenmao sued the Police Bureau and asked the local inspection office to investigate. After the prosecutor investigated, he believed that the ownership of the house belonged to China Trade Bank, and Tianzhang did not obtain legal lease rights. Yesterday, according to Article 320, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, "Anyone who intentionally takes other people's immovable property for their own benefit or the unlawful benefit of a third party shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than five years, detention, or a fine of not more than five hundred yuan."

### Concubine of the Puppet Nanjing Mayor Yang Xichen Concealed Illegal Property Privately Transferred Houses and Fled with Suitcases Investigation Completed and Prosecution Filed

(Report from Our Newspaper) Yang Xichen (also known as Yang Yuxiu), the concubine of Zhou Xuechang, the puppet mayor of Nanjing who has been sentenced to death, once caused a sensation by sneaking into prison to meet with Zhou. The High Prosecutor's Office has now prosecuted Yang for the crime of "concealing illegal property." The part about Junzhan is a common criminal matter and was instructed to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday. Because Yang attempted to conceal Zhou's property after Zhou was arrested, in April of the thirty-fifth year, she used the name Yang Yuxiu to rent Room 6, 3rd Floor, 376 Nanchang Road (also known as Huanlong Road) from the Ascott Apartments office to hide Zhou's illegal property. A secret informer, Lu Dawei, reported this to the Central Trust Bureau's Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy-Puppet Property Liquidation Office. On April 17 of the thirty-sixth year, the office sent personnel to seal it off, draw up a list, and order Yang Yichen to take custody of it. Because she did not go through the bail procedure, Yang took the opportunity to privately transfer the house and furniture to Jewish Far East Bishop Ashkenazi and Polish Milner to undertake it. Later, the office discovered the previous situation and sent personnel to investigate. Yang fled with a suitcase and other items. After the High Prosecutor's Office investigated the case, it determined that Yang was suspected of violating Article 12 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors and filed a public prosecution according to law.

### Actively Launching the Invasion of China: Military Tribunal Indicts Masatoshi Honda

[Report from our Newspaper] The important Japanese war criminal, Lieutenant General Masatoshi Honda, has been investigated by the Shanghai Military Tribunal, and a public prosecution has been filed. Masatoshi Honda is 50 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, and graduated from the Army Officer School and the Army University. From 1918, he served in the 13th Cavalry Regiment of the Japanese Army until the September 18th Mukden Incident, holding important positions in the Japanese army and being an active figure in launching the invasion of China. After the September 18th Incident, he served as an aide to the Shimu Agency and a staff officer of the Kwantung Army, which were headed by Itagaki and Doihara, respectively. He carried out extensive activities in North China, using Wang Yitang to collude with ruffians, buy off bandits, disrupt social order, and plan the organization of the pseudo-Hebei-Chahar Political Council, creating the Tongzhou Incident.

### Pinghu-Shanyang Boat Massacre: Main Culprits Li Ami and Others on Trial

[Report from our Newspaper in Pinghu on the 11th] The massacre that occurred a few years ago on the Pinghu-Shanyang scheduled boat, in which thirteen people were killed by bandits, was tried in public by the local court on the 10th. The main culprits, Li Ami, Zhu Jingen, Qian A’kui, and others, were brought to trial together. The road to the courthouse was blocked by spectators. At precisely 10 a.m., the court first summoned the daughter of Wei A’qi, the owner of the Shanyang boat, who was one of the victims. She testified: "On the 3rd day of the 12th lunar month last year, the Shanyang boat set sail and returned from Jinshan the next day. Zhu saw it at the port in the evening, and knew something was up. It wasn't until the 5th day that we learned that the incident had happened at Baitang port. All the crew and passengers were tragically drowned in the river." Then, the main culprit, Li Ami, was summoned. Li testified: "I am from Jinshanwei and live in Fuxing Lane. I am a salt farmer. The idea of robbing the Shanyang boat came from my friends Wang Jinsheng and Xi Degen. We discussed robbing the Shanyang boat in Langxia, Jinshan. At that time, Xi Degen held a Thompson submachine gun, and Qian A’kui and Shen A’yu each had a pistol. There were eight of us who went to rob the boat. We waited until 4 p.m. at the Baitang port. Wang Jinsheng was the first to act. We robbed more than two million, and I got more than one hundred thousand. After the robbery, we tied a female passenger, Wang Meimei, to Luxiang. But we did not rape her. We strangled her with a rope. I don't know about the rest." Then, Zhu Jingen was summoned. Zhu testified: "At that time, because Wang Meimei knew Li Ami, we took her away to silence her. To silence her, we threw the people on the boat into the river and drowned them with large stones." The local court appointed lawyer Ding Yuchang for the defense. The court ruled that the defendants should be remanded in custody to await further questioning.

### National Middle Schools Sending Staff and Students Back to Their Hometowns: Provinces and Cities Establishing Classes to Accommodate Them: A Total of 672 Classes Established Across the Country

[Report from our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 12th] Before the war, there were only 26 national middle schools. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education established more schools one after another to accommodate displaced and out-of-school youth. By the eve of victory, the number had increased to 111. In the summer vacation of 1946, the schools began to return to their original locations. Except for a small number of schools established during the war that continued to operate, the rest were taken over or closed down by the provinces and cities. All staff and students of the schools were sent back to their hometowns and were accommodated by the educational departments of the provinces and cities by establishing schools or classes. However, all expenses were still paid by the Ministry of Education. Currently, a total of 672 classes have been established across the country, which can accommodate 2,688 teachers and staff members and 33,600 students. The number of classes established in each province and city is as follows: Jiangsu 90, Zhejiang 60, Anhui 60, Jiangxi 31, Hubei 66, Hunan 46, Sichuan 84, Fujian 10, Guangdong 10, Guangxi 5, Henan 60, Hebei 10, Shanxi 5, Shandong 10, Shaanxi 5, Gansu 5, Yunnan 40, Chongqing 61, Beijing 30, Beiping 5, Tianjin 3, Shanghai 10, Qingdao 4.

Strong Buying Momentum in Chinese Stocks

Yong Yarn Sets New High Price

Yesterday, the news regarding Chinese stocks varied. The market opened weakly but then recovered, with new buying and short covering expanding repeatedly. The market improved as it progressed, and the afternoon saw further expansion. Yong Yarn and Xinhuo set new high prices. The holiday schedule for the end of the year and the New Year had already been announced, covering a long period, and settlements had to be completed within the year, causing some hesitation and weakness. Yong Yarn opened at 409 yuan and 422 yuan, but spot sales reached 394 yuan and forward sales reached 406 yuan. Out-of-market trading opened before formal trading, with interest rates rising to 25.5 cents and 30 cents, contributing to the initial weakness. Later, due to increased demand for spot and forward trades, buying interest from the Nanjing group was triggered, leading to a rally, and the buying momentum intensified, pushing prices back up to 406 yuan and 421 yuan. Prices then rose further to 427 yuan and 445 yuan before retreating to 415 yuan and 430 yuan. At this point, rumors fueled buying, further intensifying the rally, pushing spot prices to a high of 432 yuan and forward prices to a high of 454 yuan. Around noon, prices briefly fell to 420 yuan and 440 yuan before recovering to close at 427 yuan and 448 yuan. Sino-French stocks improved as they progressed, while Xinhuo, Huafeng, and the "Three Little Ones" also closely followed, with significant gains. As a result, spot stocks of Sino-French, Huafeng, and Xinhuo rose by over 10%, while Jingfu, Meiya, Huaxin, Zhabei, Tongyi, China Silk, Matches, National Goods, and Yonggong rose by 5%. Xinya remained flat, China Textile slightly decreased, and the rest showed slight increases. Forward stocks of Qinxing and Huafeng rose by 10%, while the rest rose by 5%.

In the afternoon, evening newspapers reported the passage of a 60 million loan, boosting sentiment after the opening, with Yong Yarn forward sales reaching 442 yuan, accompanied by bizarre rumors, boosting confidence. Sino-French and Xinhuo Porcelain both reached their limit up, and Rongfeng also reached its limit. Yong Yarn rose to a new high of 455 yuan for spot and 471 yuan for forward. With a difference of over 100 billion yuan in National Bank entries, prices retreated to within 445 yuan and 460 yuan. Before the close, prices fell to 442 yuan and 455 yuan, with Sino-French, Xinhuo, and Huafeng reaching their limit up. As a result, compared to the morning close, spot stocks of Sino-French, Xinhuo, and Huafeng reached their limit up, Rongfeng recovered after reaching its limit up, and Yong Yarn, Meiya, Jinglun, and China Cement also rose by 5%, with the rest showing slight increases. Forward stocks of Huafeng and Meiya each rose by about 5%, with the rest showing slight increases. Out-of-market, buying was mainly concentrated in old stocks.

Textile Construction and Textile Adjustment Continue to Allot

Cotton Yarn Sales Are Slow, Cloth Market Slightly Firm Before Close, Spot Cotton Trends Weak

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Textile Construction Company and the Textile Adjustment Committee continued to sell yarn yesterday. However, due to tight credit conditions and severe shortages of acceptance bills, Textile Construction sold a total of 542 bales, equivalent to 954 bales of 20-count yarn, with a total of 330 applications. In addition to selling 308 bales of various counts of yarn, the Textile Adjustment Committee also routinely allotted 131 bales of 20-count yarn, with a total of 114 applicants. The opening price of Textile Construction remained the same, calculated based on 28.11 million yuan for 20-count yarn. The Textile Adjustment Committee's bidding prices were 30 million yuan for 20-count yarn, 15.4 million yuan for 6-count yarn, 39 million yuan for 32-count yarn, 42 million yuan for 40-count yarn, and 47.5 million yuan for 42-count double-ply yarn.

Also, it is reported that the cotton yarn market situation yesterday was stable due to the unchanged price of yarn allotted by Textile Construction Company, which manufacturers and colleagues can apply for. However, after hearing that the authorities continued to sell in large quantities, buying interest from all parties weakened, and credit remained tight, with few buyers appearing, prices gradually declined. By the close, there was a slight recovery, but the closing price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to fall by 1.4 million compared to the previous day's close, falling to 47.2 million yuan. The market for other counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined by 200,000 to over 1 million yuan to varying degrees.

In the cotton cloth market, the opening this morning was due to the large supply sold by Textile Construction Company every other day. Although the market had sufficient chips and buyers were willing to purchase, the restrictions on remittances and the tighter position of the industry led to a lot of selling, and asking prices gradually loosened. Towards the close, small dye factories took advantage of the low prices to buy, and retail investors also became active. As a result, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, rose by 12,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market for bleached cloth also improved slightly, and the market for other cloths showed a clear, stable, and firm trend.

Yesterday's spot cotton market trended weak, with buyers having urgent credit needs and very little acceptance of bills, leading to sluggish transactions, with a turnover of 250 bales. 4.96 million were sent to factories in Shashi, 4.795 million for warehouse delivery, 3.637 million for fire engines, and 945,000 for Zhoupu cottonseed.

Oil and Grease Industry Asks for Increased Allocation of Diesel to Increase Kerosene Production

The Shanghai Oil and Grease Commercial Association, for the purpose of applying for the allocation of diesel oil for the oil refineries of its members, specially submitted a document to the Import and Export Control Committee, stating that the kerosene refineries among its members, in view of the fact that kerosene is a daily necessity for the public, and even more so because of the current fuel shortage and the public's need, and because the import of foreign kerosene is subject to quota controls, have established factories for refining in succession in order to seek remedies. The products of each factory have been gradually refined and improved, and are no less than those imported from abroad. Although the Social Bureau previously ordered the cessation of refining, the association presented a detailed statement of reasons to the municipal government, which approved the revocation of the order and agreed to cultivate each record. However, the refining of kerosene relies on diesel oil as the main raw material, and each refinery previously turned to domestic orders through importers. With the establishment of the Transportation Management Committee, it is impossible to directly order. Now that Lianhuo Shan has been recognized by the authorities as important, it should be cultivated, and the need for raw materials should be requested from the Transportation Management Committee to allocate Chai Shan, so as to ensure industrial safety and meet the main purpose of planting machinery. In addition to submitting to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office for assistance in applying for approval, a list of the names and production quantities of each oil refinery will be attached at any time. Please allocate diesel oil.

Central Sand and Taiwan Red Continue to Be Tight

The sugar market yesterday saw continuous rises in central sand, white Taiwan, and red sand due to shortages, while the rest showed slight loosening. The association's trading price was 1.15 million yuan for the two-four-group white small package, and 1.12 million yuan for the small package. The spot price for large packages was still 1.189 million yuan. The spot price for 20 central sand white was 1.165 million yuan, up 10,000 yuan. Taiwan red was 1.17 million yuan.

Commercial Briefs

Trade in foreign tea is mostly stagnant, and domestic flower varieties continue to be absorbed by the main street stores.

The cigarette market was weak yesterday morning and recovered in the afternoon. Ten Big British Old Knives rose by 650,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other high-grade cigarettes also rose slightly.

The soap market is still expensive due to caustic soda, and door stores and colleagues are absorbing it. The prices of Guban, Arrow, Daoguang, and Guanghua soaps are rising by 12,000 yuan. Matches are also rising by 1020,000, and foreign candles are rising by 20,000, with Chicken Brand priced at 940,000 yuan.

The timber market trended stable yesterday, with fir still within 5,000 yuan. Foreign pine is still soft due to exchange settlement.

Culture and History Hu Shi's Inscription on the Zhai Family Collection of Iron Zither and Bronze Sword Tower Ming Manuscript of the Water Classic Commentary Hu Shi

On September 5, the 36th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xu Senyu and I visited the Qu brothers in Changshu and met Mr. Xuchu. He was kind enough to show us the Ming manuscript of the Water Classic Commentary, formerly from his family's collection in the Iron Zither and Bronze Sword Tower. I wrote a few notes at the time, and only after returning to Beiping did I write this inscription.

Of the existing Ming manuscripts and Song editions, I have only seen these three complete:

Yongle Encyclopedia Edition
Changshu Qu Family Collection Edition
Haiyan Zhu Family Collection Edition

Among these three editions, the Encyclopedia edition is the most complete. The Qu and Zhu editions both have many misplaced pages. Mr. Qu Fengqi once proofread and corrected the misplaced pages in the Qu edition using the Encyclopedia edition. Last year, I wrote a postscript to the Zhu edition, also pointing out that in volume 38 alone, there were fourteen misplaced pages. The Ming manuscripts of the Water Classic Commentary that I have seen, apart from the Encyclopedia edition, do not have the volume and page numbers marked on the binding seams, so they are most prone to misplaced pages. (The Water Classic Commentary fragment in the Lianhu Academy manuscript collection of the Tianjin Library is also a Ming manuscript and Song edition, and also does not have volume and page numbers.)

This book is written in blue silk-lined paper, with ten lines per half page and twenty characters per line, but there are also twenty-two or twenty-three characters per line. It is bound in twelve volumes, each with the "Haiyu" seal at the beginning, as well as the seals "Wu Shengqin Yin" and "Baihua." Mr. Xu Senyu and Mr. Zhao Ziyun both said that "Haiyu" is Xu Xuemo. Xu Xuemo was a Jinshi in the 29th year of Jiajing, born in the first year of Jiajing (1522) and died in the 21st year of Wanli (1593). Wu Shengqin was born in the seventh year of Yongzheng (1729) and died in the eighth year of Jiaqing (1863). Xu Xuemo had 79 volumes of the Haiyu Collection and also compiled 98 volumes of the General History of Huguang. This Qu edition comes from his family and is a manuscript from the 16th century, its transcription date is not far from the era of the Encyclopedia reprint and the era of Huang Shengzeng's engraved Water Classic Commentary (1534). (The Iron Zither and Bronze Sword Tower Book Collection Catalog, volume 11, page 14, records this book, only noting the seals "Wu Shengqin Yin" and "Baihua," without noting the "Haiyu" seal.)

The Qu edition has a preface by Li Daoyuan, with half a page of 220 characters missing in the middle. The Liu Dazhong manuscript Song edition also has this preface, and also lacks this half page. This shows that the Qu edition and the Liu Dazhong edition probably come from the same source. The Zhu edition and the Huang Shengzeng engraved edition do not have the preface. The Encyclopedia has the full text of the preface.

In volume 6, the Huisui chapter quotes a passage from the ancient text Suoyu, the Huang Shengzeng edition (page 12) reads:
...Duke asked Shi Kuang about the deity of Shouyang...

There is a large body fox tail, its name is Rizhe drinking alcohol. The Zhu and Qu editions (with misplaced pages in the Qu edition at this point) are the same as the Huang edition, both writing "there is a large" (large is a mistake for dog), and both writing "its name is Rizhe." The Song engraved fragment collected by Mr. Fu Yuanshu is also like this. The Encyclopedia edition also writes "there is a large," but a "missing" character is noted next to "its name is Ri." (The Taiping Yulan, volume 40, quotes this text, leaving five characters blank after "its name is Ri.")

Using the above two standards, it can be seen that the Encyclopedia edition and the other editions seem to come from different sources.

The Encyclopedia edition has the full text of the preface.
The Liu Dazhong and Qu editions both have this preface.
The Huang Shengzeng and Zhu editions both do not have this preface.

In the Suisui chapter, "its name is Rizhe," the Encyclopedia edition writes "its name is Ri Zhe."
The Qu and Zhu editions write "its name is Rizhe."
The Huang edition writes "its name is Rizhe."

In volume 8, the Jisui chapter records Fan Juqing's grave, the Huang Shengzeng edition (page 19) writes "Fan Juqing's grave, the name pieces still exist." The Qu edition, the Zhu edition, and the Encyclopedia edition all write "a name piece." The Southern Song Hong Shi Lishi quotes this text, also writing "name piece." (This part is incomplete in the surviving Song edition.) The Wu Guan engraved edition first changed "name pieces still exist" to "stone pillars still exist." Mi Mouyu, Yuan Chun, Xiang Xi, and Huang Chen all follow the Wu Guan edition and write "stone pillars." Quan Xieshan and Zhao Dongqian also write "stone pillars." The two Dai Jianyuan editions both follow the ancient edition and write "name pieces." "Name piece" is a noun that is still in use in Quanzhou today. The Wu Guan edition's alteration is unfounded.

In volume 16, the Shuisui chapter records the Qianjin Canal project in the most detail. The Huang Shengzeng edition (page 6) has this sentence:
Later, Zhang Fang entered Luoyang, broke the Qianjin Canal, and officials and civilians relied on it.

Having broken the Qianjin Canal, why did officials and civilians "rely on it"? This statement is unreasonable, so Quan Xieshan, Zhao Dongqian, Dai Dongyuan, and others all referred to the Taiping Yulan and the Jin Shu, adding the story of Li Ju and Yuan Fu repairing the Qianjin Canal after "officials and civilians relied on it." Now, examining the Encyclopedia edition, this sentence reads:
Later, Zhang Fang entered Luoyang and broke the Qianjin Canal, officials and civilians stopped.

The Zhu edition is consistent with the Encyclopedia edition. The Qu edition writes this sentence:
Later, Zhang Fang entered Luoyang and broke the Qianjin Canal, officials and civilians immediately stood.

The following text is "water accumulated over the years, the canal was destroyed, the stone masonry was almost exhausted, and the remains are still visible." After we have read that the Encyclopedia and Zhu editions write "officials and civilians stopped," and the Qu edition writes "officials and civilians immediately stood," we can naturally realize that this sentence originally read "officials and civilians immediately lacked water," and the full text should read:
Later, Zhang Fang entered Luoyang, broke the Qianjin Canal, and officials and civilians immediately lacked water. The canal accumulated over the years was destroyed, the stone masonry was almost exhausted, and the remains are still visible. In the Taihe period of the imperial court (Northern Wei), the old canal was repaired.

With this kind of textual criticism, there is no need to add words. The Jin Shu Hui Emperor's concubine said:
In the second year of Tai'an...in the eleventh month, on the Xin Si day...Zhang Fang destroyed the Qianjin Canal, the water mills were all dry, so he distributed palace slaves to the troops.

This can be used as evidence. The Qu edition's "immediately stood" is closer to "immediately lacked," and can be used for textual criticism.

This book was transcribed by several transcribers, with slight differences in skill, and differences in precision. Sometimes the Qu edition is better than the Zhu edition, such as in volume 3, which records the petroleum of Sun Nanshan in Yanshou County, Jiuquan. The Qu edition writes:
The Transmission of Objects records that the fruit water produced in the southern mountain of Yanshou County, Jiuquan is as large as a dou, and the ground is a ditch, the water has fat, like meat juice. Those who take it in a container, start yellow and then black, like solidified cream. However, it is extremely bright, and the bones are no different. It is very good for coating carriages and water tanks. The locals call it Shisheng. The Zhu edition mistakenly writes "solidified cream" as "doubtful cream," which is not as good as the Qu edition. The last sentence in the Zhu edition is "the locals call it Shishi lacquer," the Qu edition does not repeat the "stone" character, and the "lacquer" character is mistakenly written as "sheng," so there are mutual advantages and disadvantages.

But sometimes the Qu edition is not as good as the Zhu edition. For example, in volume 34, the Shuisui chapter, quoting Ma Diboshu, there is:
Its height is either thought to be Xiaoboshi or thought to be ice and snow.

The Zhu edition is the same as the Encyclopedia edition. The Qu edition writes:
Its height is either thought to be Xiaoboshi or thought to be water.

Writing "ice and snow" is correct. Huang Shengzeng changed these fourteen characters in the engraved edition to:
Its height is like looking at floating clouds, steep stone walls.

This is based on Liu Zhao's supplement to the Continued History of the Han Dynasty Sacrificial Records, but it is not the original text of the Song edition. Sun Qian's collated edition quotes the Liu Dazhong edition, which is the same as the Encyclopedia and Zhu editions. It can be seen that the ancient editions before the Huang engraved edition are all like this, in which "Boshi" is a mistake for "Baishi." (See Dai Dongyuan's original text for the words revised in this article.)

There is no complete Song engraved edition of the Water Classic Commentary today, but fortunately, the Encyclopedia edition and the Ming manuscripts of the Song editions collected by the Qu and Zhu families are still complete from beginning to end. Huang Shengzeng's engraved edition has fourteen misplaced pages and two missing pages, which these three editions do not mistake. The Encyclopedia edition has the best base edition, but the existing edition is a re-copied edition, with some small omissions. These two Ming manuscripts should be used to carefully collate and add the collation of the remaining Song edition of eleven volumes to restore a Song edition of the Water Classic Commentary. The Qu edition has Xu Haiyu's seal. The transcription date is between Jiajing and Wanli at the latest. The remnant of Li Daoyuan's preface that it preserves is the same as the Liu Dazhong edition, so it seems to be earlier than the manuscript collected by the Zhu family. (36, 9, 13 midnight)

Discussing "Arranging Music Sequences" with Mr. Lu Yiye Yan Zie

Lu Yiye's "An Outline of Chinese Drama" (published by the Shanghai World Book Company) has the following passage in the third chapter, "The Prosperity of Song Drama":

"The 'Arranging Music Sequences' in Zhou Mi's Old Affairs of Wulin is the origin of the modern 'playbill.' It is also somewhat like the scenario of a play."

An Examination of the Stone Drum Inscription Being Carved in the Third Year of Qin Linggong Tang Lan

The Curse of Chu inscription has six "I" characters, three "Wu" characters, the boundary between "I" and "Wu" is not very clear, and there is no "Zhen" character.

Luo Zhenyu thought that the Qin Gong Yuan Bell was from the time of Duke Mu, and Guo Moruo thought it was from the time of Duke Jing. The inscription says: "Twelve Dukes," Guo's statement is probably credible. It can be seen that in the time of Duke Jing (576-537 BC), the character "Zhen" was still used and not "Bi" or "Wu," but in the Curse of Chu inscription made in the time of Duke Huiwen due to the five kingdoms attacking Qin (318 BC), "Wu" was used instead of "Zhen." The Stone Drum Inscription is close to the Curse of Chu inscription, its era will definitely not be earlier than the Qin Gong Yuan Bell or the Duke Mu inscription.

The Qin Gong Yuan Bell and the Qin Gong Zhong do not have the characters "Ou" or "Ye." The character "Lei" has never been seen in bronze ware before the Spring and Autumn period. The Chen Chang Tao Kettle from the late Spring and Autumn period has the character "Ye," and the Stone Drum Inscription uses the character "Ou" twice. The Ya Chi edition and the Wu Cheng edition of the Curse of Chu inscription say: "To save oneself," the Qiu Yuan edition writes "Ye." The Xin Mu Tiger Tally uses the character "Ou," and the Qin weights and measures use the character "Ye," sometimes also using "Ou." It can be seen that the Stone Drum Inscription should be after the late Spring and Autumn period.

The "Yu" character in the Stone Drum Inscription has a radical derived from "Yu."

Based on this evidence, we can point out that the Stone Drum Inscription should be after the end of the Spring and Autumn period. However, it calls the ruler "Gong" instead of "Wang," and comparing it with the Shang Yang measurements, the script is much more complex, so it should be before Duke Xiao of Qin, that is, from 481 BC (the year Chen Chang assassinated Duke Jian and Xiang Ping of Lu) to 361 BC (the first year of Duke Xiao of Qin).

The Stone Drums were unearthed in Tianxing County Santiyuan, now Fengxiang County, which was the Qin Yongyi. The Records of the Grand Historian Justice in the Qin Benji commentary Santiyi quote Kuo Di Zhi saying:
"Santiyuan is located twenty south of Qizhou Yongxian. Duke Wen of Qin built Shantiyi, Duke Xiang built Xiyi, and Duke Ling built Wuyang. Shangyi, all on this plain, hence the name."

In the past, scholars mostly believed that the inscription was related to the construction of the sacrifice, so they always placed it in the time of Duke Wen or Duke Xiang. According to my view, the inscription is indeed related to the construction of the sacrifice (a detailed examination elsewhere), but the era is wrong. According to Fengyi Shu, Duke Xiang lived in the west and built Xiyi, so Xiyi would never be in Yongyi, the Kuo Di Zhi quoted above is wrong. Justice quotes Kuo Di in the Miyi commentary
"The Han Dynasty had five sacrifices in Qizhou Yongxian, namely, Jiyi, Wuyang Shangyi, Xiayi, Miyi, and Beiyi."

There is no Xiyi. Beiyi was established by Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty to worship the Black Emperor, originally four sacrifices, Jiyi worshiped the White Emperor, Miyi worshiped the Green Emperor, Wuyang Shangyi worshiped the Yellow Emperor, and Xiayi worshiped the Yan Emperor. Among the four seasons, Miyi is in Weinan, then the Santiyuan in Yongnan should only be Jiyi and Wuyang Shangyi.

Above, I have pointed out that the writing used in the Stone Drum Inscription will definitely not be in the Spring and Autumn period, so it is obviously wrong to say that it is the inscription of Jiyi or associate it with Chen Baizhi and the like. However, what is the significance of these ten inscriptions being unearthed in Santiyuan? I remember Mr. Xu Xusheng said that this kind of large stone is not produced in Fengxiang, but is common in Chencang, south of the Wei River. Then, what is the purpose of transporting this kind of large stone to carved inscriptions at a great expense between Paiyong?

From the comparison of the script, I concluded that among these 120 years of the Stone Drum, the Qin state only had one major event in Yongyi, which was the third year of Duke Ling. This was after Duke De fought Yong and Duke Xuan built Miyi, after an interval of 250 years. These two sacrifices are on Santiyuan, that is, the place where the Stone Drums were unearthed, so there is no doubt that these ten inscriptions were made because of the construction of the sacrifice. This is the reason why the Qin people took the Pai Mountain that they sweated to make as the Wu Mountain, so the inscription mentions Qiyang, and involves King Cheng of Zhou's Qiyang hunt, and also attaches the Xixiyang of the Great Unification Eleventh Year, the Litianyiyang of the Zhenjun Seventh Year, adding to the knowledge that this is Wuyang, so there is no need to be so confusing. The inscription Qiu also mentioned "successor king." The third year of Duke Ling of Qin was the fourth year of King Weilie of Zhou, and it was also newly ascended to the throne, so it can of course be called the successor king.

The Stone Drum Inscription, in any case, does not seem like the work of the Three Hundred Poems at the same time. Now it is set as the third year of Duke Ling, which is already the early Warring States period, so it is no wonder that it is similar to the poems in the Biography of King Mu of Zhou. In ancient history, the historical materials of the early Warring States period are the most lacking, and the Stone Drum Inscription can just fill this gap. If we arrange the Qin ware into:

### Goods Arriving in Both Northern and Southern Cities are Still Abundant, Rice Transactions Gradually Returning to Normal, Oil Beans and Miscellaneous Grains Also Showing Signs of Weakness

[Our Newspaper] The northern and southern rice markets resumed normal transactions yesterday. Ji Mingqi, head of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, personally supervised the market opening. The arrival of goods in both cities was still abundant, and the market situation was good. Prices generally fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Wu Wenxian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters: The government will protect legitimate merchants, but those who illegally raise prices will be severely punished. In the future, when economic police are performing tasks in the market, if they discover acts of disrupting the market and illegally raising prices that require arrest, they should contact the staff of the Social Affairs Bureau stationed at the market. If both parties have different opinions on the handling methods, they can respectively ask the heads of the relevant bureaus for instructions. If an agreement still cannot be reached, they should ask Mayor Wu for a decision.

Yesterday, a total of more than 15,300 dan of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The southern market was weak at first and then stronger, while the northern market was stable at first and then firm. In the end, there was not much honor or disgrace for japonica rice, and white rice showed its elegance. Flour sales were quite brisk, and prices rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Wheat was average, and wheat bran sales in the countryside were slack, falling back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake was stagnant in Taiwan and slack in Shantou, and the upward trend stopped and turned downward. Soybean oil assistance was encountered, and the local market did not look ahead. The intention of oil was lukewarm, depressed, and prices fell by 3,000 to 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. The supply and demand of bean are both scarce, and there is not much fluctuation. Red beans and broad beans have no fluctuations. Sorghum is smoothly delivered in the north, increasing sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Corn, on the other hand, fell back by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. There were not many transactions of sesame in foreign firms, and the situation was a little lackluster. Medium and low-grade sesame were cut by 10,000 yuan, and black sesame also decreased by a small amount of 10,000 yuan. High-quality goods were stable. Raw peanuts were slightly active in the Guangxi area. The demand for fried goods in winter continued, and they remained high and popular, followed by stagnation.

The oil market has re-entered a slump. With the suspension of passenger assistance, raw oil fell sharply by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Vegetable and sesame oil and soybean oil successively fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Refined oil was in a flat and sluggish state. The long-rumored allocated oil is said to be available for sale in a few days, and the procedures are being rushed through.
