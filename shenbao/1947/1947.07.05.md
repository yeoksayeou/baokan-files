### Suppressing Internal Disorder and Consolidating Unity: Implementing the National Reconstruction Policy Through Peace - State Council Passes General Mobilization Proposal

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The "Vigorously Implement National General Mobilization" proposal submitted by Chairman Chiang and agreed upon by both the Party and the government, was passed at the sixth State Council meeting held on the morning of the 4th at 9:00 AM. Before the discussion, Chairman Chiang first explained the significance of the proposal, emphasizing the necessity of vigorously implementing national general mobilization and suppressing the communist bandits to realize constitutional government. Committee Member Zou Lu then spoke, stating that the general mobilization was indeed necessary. Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party, Ji Yiqiao of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Wang Chonghui and Weng Wenhao also spoke separately. Yu Jiaju expressed support for the proposal, but emphasized the need to ensure that strengthening the suppression of communist military forces does not lead to the neglect of safeguarding the basic rights of the people. Ji Yiqiao stated that after expressing his agreement to the proposal, a peaceful resolution with the Communist Party was no longer possible, and therefore, only force remained. However, if the military suppression of the communists is to be implemented thoroughly, attention must be paid to the separation of military and civil governance, strengthening the powers of provincial and county administrative officials, separating central and local powers, establishing local armed forces, and reforming local politics, so that these measures can coordinate with the military and eliminate the communist forces. Subsequently, Chen Bulei and six others were nominated to revise the text. The committee members then took a break for more than twenty minutes before reconvening, and the proposal was then read out and passed. The Chairman expressed satisfaction with the revisions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The National Government Committee held its sixth State Council meeting in the National Government meeting hall at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 4th. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting, and committee members Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Wu Zhongxin, Chen Bulei, Yu Jiaju, Hu Haimen, Ji Yiqiao, Mo Dehui, Chen Huide, and Wang Yunwu, totaling twenty-two people, were present. Wu Tiecheng, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Li Wenfan, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Zhou Zhongyue, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, Huang Shaohong, Vice President of the Control Yuan, Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense, Zhang Lisheng, Minister of the Interior and Chairman of the General Election Office, Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance, Wu Dingchang, Chief Secretary, Xue Yue, Chief of Staff, and Xu Kan, Director-General of Budget, were all in attendance.

### Implementation Measures to be Drafted Separately

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] After the National General Mobilization proposal was passed by the State Council, its implementation has been entrusted to the Executive Yuan and relevant departments to jointly draft concrete measures. It is understood that new measures will be taken in various relevant sectors, including the economy, politics, military, food, and society. The economic reform plan will also undergo some changes. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has decided to have Wang Yunwu be responsible for convening relevant personnel to jointly draft measures. It is reported that the Ministers of Finance, Economy, Food, Agriculture, and Interior are all ex officio members. These measures will be drafted and promulgated. Furthermore, the spirit of this proposal lies in: (1) strengthening conscription; (2) strengthening grain requisition; and (3) increasing national treasury revenue. The financial and food departments will enter a wartime system.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The National Government held its sixth State Council meeting today and passed a proposal to vigorously implement national general mobilization. The National Government has ordered the Executive Yuan to forward it to the relevant departments for compliance and implementation, and has also distributed it to the Legislative Yuan and other agencies directly under the National Government for their information. The instructions to the Executive Yuan are recorded as follows: "On July 4 of this year, the sixth State Council meeting of the Government Committee passed a resolution to save the people in the bandit-controlled areas, safeguard national survival, consolidate national unity, vigorously implement national general mobilization, suppress the communist bandit rebellion, remove obstacles to democracy, realize constitutional government as scheduled, and implement the national reconstruction policy through peace. This resolution should be earnestly implemented. In addition to issuing separate orders, the original proposal is hereby copied and sent to you for compliance and for forwarding to the relevant departments for handling. This order."

### Full Text of the General Mobilization Proposal

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] At the State Council meeting of the National Government Committee on the 4th, a proposal submitted by the Chairman to realize constitutional government as scheduled and implement the national reconstruction policy through peace was passed. The original proposal is recorded as follows:

In order to save the people in the bandit-controlled areas, safeguard national survival, and consolidate national unity, it is proposed to vigorously implement national general mobilization to suppress the communist bandit rebellion, remove obstacles to democracy, realize constitutional government as scheduled, and implement the national reconstruction policy through peace.

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the government has been actively carrying out demobilization in order to engage in reconstruction and allow the people to rest and recuperate. Although all measures have not been as satisfactory as expected, it has always adhered to the principle of political solutions for the actions of the Chinese Communist Party in possessing troops, occupying territory, disrupting local areas, and rebelling against the country by force. It has spared no effort to compromise and tolerate in order to achieve this goal. However, since October of last year, the Communist Party has first refused to comply with the government's cease-fire order, then refused to participate in the National Assembly, and then refused the government's proposal to send representatives to Yan'an to discuss peace. Most recently, its propaganda organs have resolutely rejected the peace proposals of the National Political Council. While the government is striving to reorganize its army, the Communist Party is coercing the masses and expanding its rebellious military force on a large scale. While the government is striving for demobilization and reconstruction, the communist bandits are obstructing the progress of demobilization everywhere and destroying our transportation, industry, and mining construction everywhere. While the government is striving to realize democratic politics and preparing for constitutional work, the communist bandits are preaching democracy on one hand and cruelly abusing the people on the other, using every means possible. In recent months, the communist bandits have launched large-scale offensives against our national army in North China and Northeast China, hindering the government's complete takeover of territorial sovereignty. Their determination to overthrow the country by force is extremely obvious, and their acts of inciting social unrest and disrupting public order are also becoming increasingly clear. The communist bandits have openly launched a full-scale armed rebellion and have isolated themselves from the people of the country. They have long regarded themselves as an armed rebellious group and have excluded themselves from the ranks of political parties, not hesitating to be enemies of the country and the nation. Their obstinacy and failure to come to their senses have reached this point, so the government's national policy of peaceful reconstruction cannot be resolved through political means. In particular, our compatriots in the northern regions ravaged by the communist bandits and in areas close to the bandit-controlled areas are suffering more and more every day. The government cannot continue to delay and sit idly by. Furthermore, our compatriots across the country want to live and work in peace and contentment, and it is not enough to defend the foundation of the country and the safety of all the people without eliminating this greatest obstacle to reconstruction and national rejuvenation with all our strength. Moreover, the government has the responsibility to consolidate national unity and safeguard national survival. If the rebellion is not suppressed as soon as possible, not only will constitutional government and democracy not be realized, but the unity and security of the country will also lose their guarantee. Therefore, the government's determination to suppress the rebellion is a last resort. It is necessary for the military and civilians across the country to concentrate their will, mobilize national strength, and on one hand, step up the suppression of the rebellion and actively engage in construction in order to remove the obstacles to democratic constitutional government and achieve the goal of peaceful national reconstruction. Based on this purpose, it is proposed that the State Council decide to implement national general mobilization, call on the whole nation to rise up together and strive forward. All matters, including strengthening economic construction, revitalizing local politics, mobilizing manpower and material resources, improving the grain and corvée systems, maintaining social security, relieving the suffering of the people, safeguarding the basic rights of the people, vigorously implementing consumption savings, increasing agricultural and industrial production, and improving the treatment of officers and soldiers, should be handed over to the relevant departments to properly formulate plans, enact laws, and implement them in accordance with the law. As for how to prevent disturbances outside the law during the implementation, the relevant departments should be strictly instructed to pay close attention.

### State Council Discusses Relevant Election Proposals

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The State Council discussed the proposal submitted by the Chairman regarding "whether the implementation date of the National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan Legislators Election and Recall Law should be calculated from the date when all the attached tables are announced, as requested by the General Election Office, or how it should be stipulated." This sparked a debate. The case was submitted by the Election Office, stating that although the implementing regulations and distribution tables for the election and recall of National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan Legislators will be announced successively, the attached table for the distribution of the number of National Assembly Representatives and the distribution table for the number of Legislators from professional groups have not yet been announced. Before these attached tables are announced in full, the election work cannot be advanced, and the election procedures cannot be determined. It is necessary to wait until all the attached tables are announced before implementation can begin. However, the procedures for the preparation for the implementation of the Constitution stipulate that it must be completed within six months after the promulgation of the election law, and the deadline is extremely urgent. The office had resolved that the implementation date of the election law should be calculated from the date when all the attached tables are announced. During the discussion, some argued that the date should still be calculated from the date of promulgation of the Election and Recall Law and its implementing regulations, while others advocated following the Election Office's proposal. After a lengthy discussion, it was finally decided to hand it over to the Legal System Review Committee for review before submitting it to the General Assembly for discussion.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] National Government order: (1) The table of distribution of the number of representatives of professional groups in the National Assembly is hereby promulgated. This order. (2) Article 12 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law is hereby amended and promulgated. This order. (3) Article 12 of the Legislative Yuan Legislator Election and Recall Law is hereby amended and promulgated. This order. (4) The division of electoral districts for Legislative Yuan legislators residing abroad and the table of distribution of the number of legislators to be elected from each district are hereby promulgated. This order.

### Soviet News Agency Fabricates Rumors

Falsely Accuses the US of Jointly Establishing a Secret Service Agency

Relevant Parties State that There is No Such Thing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Soviet Union's News Agency reported on June 22 that "China and the United States intend to establish a joint secret service agency in Shanghai to prevent the illegal sale of drugs, with representatives from the United Nations participating," and stated that "the tasks are difficult to understand." The reporter inquired about this matter with relevant parties and learned that in March of this year, the United States suggested that China and the United States sign an informal bilateral agreement to exchange reports on anti-narcotics smuggling and information on suspected smugglers in order to effectively promote detection and anti-smoking work. Our side agreed to this suggestion and established the "Measures for the Exchange of International Anti-Narcotics Smuggling Information" by the Executive Yuan on May 23. The so-called "establishment of a joint China-US secret service agency in Shanghai" reported by the News Agency is completely unfounded.

### Guangdong Police Security Department Plans to Suppress Bandits in the Territory

[Our Guangzhou Office, 4th] After the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Police Security Department on July 1, Director Chen Pei held his first reception for reporters here. In addition to reporting on the department's tasks and organization, he stated that the bandits in the province currently have political backgrounds. The bandits in Dongjiang and Beijiang can only cause disturbances and have no other effect. The bandits in the Nanlu-Qiongya area are more active and may expand outwards. However, from the current perspective, the bandit problem is not very serious. Now that the department has been established, there will be strict plans to suppress them separately, and it is believed that eradication will not be difficult.

[Our Baoding Office, 4th] The war on the Beiping-Hankou Line has entered a decisive stage. The National Army has crossed Gu City to advance south. It has been confirmed that the communist army around Baoding is moving more frequently, and most of them have moved to the railway side between Xushui and Gu City. The two armies are preparing for a main battle. The meeting of the National Army from the north and south will depend on the recovery of Xushui. The remaining communists around Gu City have been cleared. The communist army attacked the outskirts of Baoding again last night and retreated on the morning of the 4th.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 4th] The National Army won a great victory in the northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway. In the battles of Beihedian and Liujiazhuang, the communist army's 6th and 7th Brigades were defeated, and another 20 regiments were completely annihilated.

### Implement National Mobilization to the Fullest Extent, Enabling the People to Discern Right from Wrong, Change Essential to Express Opinions on the Mobilization Plan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Vice Chairman Sun spoke on the 4th, regarding the "Implement National Mobilization to the Fullest Extent" plan passed by the State Council, stating that the Communist Party has launched a full-scale rebellion, threatening the nation's survival. The government, in order to comprehensively respond, has passed this critical plan based on the National Mobilization Law. This decision does not greatly differ from the punitive expedition order, the difference being that the punitive expedition order was specifically against the Communist Party, while this decision mobilizes the internal government. After this plan is passed, it will be handed over to the Executive Yuan to draft a plan and promulgate laws to implement it. The reporter also interviewed government and Youth Party figures on the 4th, inquiring about their opinions on the national mobilization plan.

Secretary-General Wu Dingchang stated: The Communist Party has occupied territory with armed forces and disrupted local areas for a long time. The government should clarify the facts to enable the people of the country to understand the truth. The mobilization work will be assigned to the relevant authorities to carefully draft measures and implement them. The military action against the Communists is not intended as a punitive expedition, but as a strengthening of existing efforts.

Central Committee Member Zhang Ji stated that the National Mobilization plan is essentially equivalent to a punitive expedition order and strengthens the military's efforts to suppress the Communists. This is a rare occurrence in the past decade. Since the War of Resistance, it began with joint operations, then participation in party negotiations after victory, until last year when the Chinese Communist Party abandoned peace, disturbed local areas, and the government, under much tolerance, was forced to respond. Until now, friend and foe are indistinguishable. Therefore, the passage of this plan should demonstrate to our compatriots nationwide to discern right from wrong, which is essential. Zhang believes that if national mobilization is implemented properly and military strength is enhanced, the Communist forces can be wiped out within a year.

When asked about the military aspects of the national mobilization, Minister Bai only replied that reporters should inquire with Chief of Staff Chen. The Ministry of National Defense is an implementing agency and will follow government orders. There are no plans within the Ministry regarding a timeframe for eliminating the Communist forces.

Regarding a timeframe for eliminating the Communist forces, Chen Cheng stated: "I am not a fortune teller; I cannot predict when this goal can be achieved."

Central Committee Member Chen Lifu stated: "We should concentrate all manpower and resources to expedite the suppression of the rebellion and actively build. Regarding the Communist forces, even in the United States, those disloyal to the country have the right to be disciplined. Moreover, the Communist Party occupies territory with armed forces, disrupts local areas, and undermines the Constitution, so they should be disciplined."

After the Political Situation is Clarified, Many Communist Soldiers Will Defect

For the past year, it has been both fighting and talking, making it difficult for the people to distinguish whether it is suppression or reconciliation.

This has had a major impact on the morale of the troops at the front. Moreover, Communist soldiers who want to defect are afraid that if peace talks succeed, they will be harmed by the Communist Party, so they dare not come. Therefore, after this measure is announced, the political situation will be clarified, and many Communist soldiers will defect. The defeat will be like a mountain collapsing. Imagining some time in the future, the Communist forces should be quelled, and victory may be obtained in the short term. However, we should not underestimate the Communist Party excessively.

Chen Qitian of the Youth Party expressed no objection to the national mobilization plan, stating that he agreed with this necessary measure by the government. Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party stated: "Now that this plan has been passed, it must be implemented effectively in the future. We agree with this proposal."

Shanghai Figures Value Government Decisions on the Current Situation

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, after the State Council passed the proposal on the current situation, all sectors of the city paid close attention. However, they were unwilling to comment much because they had not seen the full text of the proposal. The reporter interviewed celebrities from all walks of life yesterday to explore their feelings on this measure:

Xu Jiguang, Vice Chairman of the Senate, stated: The reason why the government does not formally issue a punitive expedition order is to respect the opinions of friendly parties, but in fact, this action is no different from a punitive expedition. Since the government is determined to mobilize the people and resources of the country to shorten the internal turmoil, it is expected that the military conflict in the country will not be prolonged for too long.

Wu Yun-chu, Chairman of the National Industrial Association, stated: The government's failure to issue a punitive expedition order leaves room for the situation. In fact, since mobilization has been approved, a punitive expedition order is unnecessary. This move has a milder posture internationally, which also has a good impact. As for seeking to quell the internal turmoil within a certain period, it is a difficult task. The current key task is how to stabilize people's hearts. In particular, young intellectuals should have the opportunity to serve the country and society. At present, there are university students who are willing to go to factories to become workers, which is an abnormal phenomenon. The current economic situation should be improved, but the relevant factors are too complicated and implementation is very difficult.

Famous lawyer Chen Tingrui stated: There is essentially no difference between issuing a punitive expedition order to the Communist Party or not. After mobilization is implemented, it has the effect of rectifying names. The conflicts in the government's policies in the past have now been completely eliminated, which should boost morale and increase combat power. As far as the international impact of this move is concerned, the international community has already taken clear sides, so there is no need to be obviously wary. In the future, the government should seek its own strength and vigorously implement the rule of law from top to bottom in order to seek political reform.

### Minister Bai Reports on Military Affairs in the Northeast and Shandong Provinces

Bai finally mentioned that the treatment of officers and soldiers must be adjusted.

The National Army on the Pingmei Line recovered the Dahe Station yesterday, and Meihekou is expected to be captured soon. Fighting near Xifeng is fierce.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] The tension and anxiety in Shenyang for the past month and a half has disappeared due to the victory in Siping.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 4th] Siping is repairing destroyed fortifications to prevent harassment from the Communist forces in the north, south, and east.

The rotting corpses have been cremated, and the area has been washed by heavy rain, greatly reducing the stench, and the hygiene team is cleaning up.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 4th] The Communist forces in southern and eastern Liaoning are only engaging in opportunistic harassment. Trains between Shenyang and Yingkou, between Shenyang and Benxi, and between Shenyang, Yingkou, and Panjin are open. The Faku Line is still open to Jinling Temple, where the National Army is firmly defending and watching the actions of the Communist forces in Beipiao.

### Legislative Yuan Adjourns for Two Months, Passed the National Assembly Women's Representative Quota Allocation Table Yesterday, Shanghai Occupies Six Out of 168

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Legislative Yuan held its 332nd regular meeting on the afternoon of the 4th, which was also the last meeting before the adjournment. The meeting will adjourn for two months from the 5th and will reconvene in early September. Today's meeting was chaired by concurrently President Sun, with more than 60 legislators present. The following cases were passed: (1) The National Assembly Women's Group Representative Quota Allocation Table. (Note: There are a total of 168 women representatives in the National Assembly, and Shanghai occupies six.) (2) Amendment to Article 26 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery. (3) Amendment to Article 7 and Article 8 of the Organizational Regulations of the Information Bureau. (4) Amendment to Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the Provincial Council Organizational Regulations. (5) Medal Committee Organizational Regulations. (6) Amendment to the Organizational Regulations of the Republic of China's Representative Office to the United Nations. (7) Re-division of the electoral districts in Gansu Province. (8) Amendment to the division of legislative electoral districts in Fujian Province, transferring Shouning County, originally belonging to the second electoral district, to the first electoral district.

Finally, a temporary motion to adjourn for one and a half to two months, jointly proposed by fifty legislators including Liu Guanxun, was discussed. It was decided to adjourn from the 5th until the end of August. The meeting adjourned at around 6:45 PM amidst the sound of the entire party.

### Draft Punishment Regulations for Obstructing Elections, Will Be Reviewed After Reconvening, Concurrently President Sun Pointed Out That the Content is Not Sufficient

At today's Legislative Yuan meeting, the National Assembly Women's Representative Quota Allocation Table was discussed first. Because the case had been discussed on the 3rd, there was no major debate at the meeting. The only dispute was the issue of branches of national women's groups. The result was still to maintain the original proposal, that is, national women's groups are limited to those with more than five branches in each province and city, and whose membership lists have been registered with the Ministry of Social Affairs.

Another election-related case was the "Draft Punishment Regulations for Obstructing Elections." The case was also discussed at the 329th regular meeting. At that time, it was decided to re-submit for review because the content still had areas worth discussing.

After the case was raised, Luo Dingyu first explained it, and then the debate began. Situ De and Cheng Yuanzhen believed that it was unnecessary. Situ De pointed out that many of the provisions in the regulations could not be implemented, and many of them were already stipulated in the Criminal Law. For example, prohibiting "openly entertaining with banquets or providing food, accommodation, and transportation" may be too unreasonable. Cheng Yuanzhen believed that election bribery was an educational and economic problem, and could not be prevented by law. Although the original intention of the regulations was to protect the poor, the result might be to protect bad people. Chen Ruxuan and others held different views, believing that having a law was better than having no law. Election bribery is inevitable even in advanced democratic countries, and the fact that it cannot be prevented does not mean that there is no need for a separate law. This country is implementing elections for the first time, and regulations are necessary, otherwise elections will become a kind of gambling behavior, and those with two tons of banknotes can overwhelm those with one ton of banknotes. Lü Fu cited the story of election bribery in the early Republic of China, and strongly advocated that there must be a separate law to prevent bribery, otherwise those with special power can do whatever they want, and the weak will never have the right to sue. Jian Guan 3, the original proposer, also believed that the purpose of this move was mainly to give those in power a certain recognition. They believed that this case was important and that it was necessary to review it comprehensively, and suggested re-submitting it for review. Finally, Concurrently President Sun stood up and spoke, pointing out that the main targets for preventing election bribery are three: (1) Local administrative officials who abuse their power, (2) Armed classes who influence elections, (3) Local political groups who use group power to threaten people inside and outside the group. The draft regulations do not prevent any of the above three, and seem to be missing something. Since the draft is not sufficient and rigorous, it seems appropriate to put this case aside for the time being and review it after the adjournment. Decision: Review after the meeting reconvenes.

### In Case of Emergency During the Adjournment, Temporary Meetings May Be Convened, Ordinary Cases Can Be Handled First and Then Complete the Procedures

The temporary motion of fifty legislators, including legislator Liu Guanxun, proposed that from the 5th to August 31st, the Legislative Yuan be discussed at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan. Concurrently President Sun first reported on the situation of the State Council meeting on the morning of the 4th. It was said that President Zhang mentioned at the meeting that during the Legislative Yuan's two-month adjournment in July and August, what would happen if the government had more important plans that needed to complete the legislative process! Everyone at the meeting believed that important military measures could not be delayed for a long time due to the Legislative Yuan's adjournment. Other cases could be handled according to the past precedent of the National Defense Committee era, first handled and then supplemented with procedures. Sun continued, during the adjournment of this court, if an emergency occurs that requires a meeting, a temporary meeting can be convened. Legislators from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places can easily come to the meeting. Sun Jiulu and others also pointed out that according to the Legislative Yuan's organizational law, if one-third of the legislators are present, it is a legal quorum. At present, transportation is convenient, and airplanes arrive in the evening after departing in the morning. If they can contact each other properly, it will not be difficult to attend a temporary meeting. Finally, it was decided to adjourn from the 5th and reconvene in early September. According to the Legislative Yuan, since last autumn, the most important work in more than ten months has been to formulate the constitutional draft and various constitutional laws and regulations. As of today, six organizational laws, four election and recall laws, and election and recall implementation regulations have been completed. The National Assembly representatives and legislative members' various quota allocation tables have also been drafted. Former President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen and current President Zhang Qun, and others, have come to the court to explain their administrative policies, which have not only made great contributions to the formulation of constitutional laws and regulations, but also made many contributions to the implementation of democratic constitutionalism. At the end of the adjournment, each legislator will go to various places to investigate constitutionalism, and after the autumn, when they come back, they will definitely make new contributions to constitutionalism.

### National Assembly Women's Representative Quota Allocation Table

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The National Assembly Women's Representative Quota Allocation Table passed at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 4th was compiled based on the principles instructed by Concurrently President Sun at the 331st meeting, that is, each province and city has two representatives as the basic number.

### The Initial Consequences of Tolerating Japan! A Japanese Member's Absurd Suggestion: "Manchuria" and Taiwan Should Hold Referendums

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] It has been learned that Osaki Yukio, a 90-year-old Japanese member, submitted a draft resolution on the future peace treaty to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the 4th, requesting that it be submitted to the Diet. Osaki suggested that a referendum should be held in the future to determine the future status of "Manchuria," Taiwan, Ryukyu, and Korea. Osaki's draft peace treaty resolution has the following three points: (1) "Manchuria," Taiwan, and Ryukyu should be placed under the supervision of the United Nations. When public peace is restored, a referendum should be held to determine whether the people there wish to be independent or to be affiliated to which country. (2) The issue of compensation should be based on the losses suffered by both parties, and the compensation should be paid to the party that suffered the most losses. (3) If the victorious country ignores this reasonable opinion when resolving the compensation issue, Japan should oppose its request by not cooperating.

### Dreaming of Refusing Compensation Responsibility

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] Osaki Yukio told Associated Press reporters today that he intends to submit a bill to the House of Representatives requesting that he refuse to bear full compensation responsibility for the Pacific War and ask the United Nations to take over most of Japan's wartime territory. The concept of "the strong and weak" must be eliminated from past treaties in order to achieve reconciliation with Japan, otherwise "the Third World War is inevitable," and newly invented weapons will lead to the demise of mankind. The losses suffered by the winning and losing countries should be fairly calculated, and "countries with the heaviest losses should be compensated by those with lighter losses." If the winning country ignores this reasonable calculation and demands compensation from Japan, then we "should refuse it by relying on selection and statistics and refuse to cooperate in collecting compensation."

### Modern Robinson Crusoe Story: Our Sailors Survive an Adventure; Honored by the British for Wartime Service with a Medal

[Our Newspaper] Mr. Aukenden, the British Consul General in Shanghai, awarded a British Empire Medal (O.B.E.) to Mr. Shen Zuting, a Chinese engineer, at the consulate at 4:00 PM yesterday to commend his heroic achievements during the war. The ceremony was quite grand, with the participation of Mr. Chen Guofu, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Evans, British Shipping Counselor in China, Mr. Balot, Naval Staff Officer in Shanghai, Mr. Brown, Assistant Naval Staff Officer, Mr. Miller, Assistant Military Attaché, and many friends of Mr. Shen. During the war, Mr. Shen served in the British Merchant Navy. On August 10, 1943, he served as the chief engineer of the "Light Valley" vessel, ordered to go to East Africa to provide military supplies. On the evening of the 13th, the ship was unfortunately attacked by a German submarine and quickly sank, with the captain killed in action. Mr. Shen led the 39 remaining survivors of the ship to drift at sea until dawn, when they found a lifeboat. The food was only enough to last for three days. Fortunately, on the third day, they discovered a small island in front of them, which they reached after the sailors worked hard to advance. However, the island was a deserted island, and Mr. Shen and others began a Robinson Crusoe-like drifting life, searching for mountain goats and eggs for food, building huts to live in, and Mr. Shen designed to convert the lifeboat's steam barrel into a distiller to turn seawater into drinking water. In this way, they managed to survive for as many as eighty days. On October 25, the watchmen discovered a reconnaissance plane in the distant sky, and they burned several bundles of raw rubber that they had found, with black smoke rising into the sky as a signal. Finally, the plane discovered them and dropped food and drink. On October 28, the British escort fleet received the news, sailed near the island, rescued all the sailors and took them aboard the ship, landing in East Africa and repatriating them to India in batches.

Editorial

### The Re-implementation of a State of Total Mobilization

Yesterday, the State Council approved an important proposal related to the current situation submitted by Chairman Chiang. According to news reports, the document is more than 2,000 words long. The proposal states: "In order to save the people in the bandit areas, ensure national survival, consolidate national unity, and request the vigorous implementation of national total mobilization to quell the rebellion of the communist bandits, eliminate obstacles to democracy, realize constitutional government on schedule, and implement the peaceful nation-building plan." As of the time of writing, we have not yet read the full text of this historically significant proclamation. Therefore, we cannot comment on the meaning of this proclamation. However, in the past week, domestic newspapers have all reported that the central government will have important resolutions: the people of the whole country are always hoping that the highest decision-making body of the central government can clarify the chaotic domestic situation as soon as possible; therefore, they have been hoping for an early decision by the State Council for some time. The decision passed by the State Council yesterday was not the punitive order expected by the public, but only a proclamation, which may disappoint some people; but we believe that this is a timely measure. The communist party's rampant lawlessness should have been ordered to be punished, to correct public opinion; we have said this again and again. However, in view of the fact that the Supreme Court has recently issued an arrest warrant for Mao Zedong, which legally recognizes Mao Zedong as a traitor, with this move, it is really meaningless for our government to issue a punitive order; moreover, it gives them importance, and from a wise perspective, it is not a wise thing.

However, although the State Council did not decide to issue a punitive order yesterday, it has placed the whole country back under a wartime system. The implementation of total mobilization has changed the whole country from peacetime to wartime. After a long period of resistance against Japan, the Chinese people finally survived until the victory of the War of Resistance; unexpectedly, soon after the victory, the whole country will return to a wartime system. Regarding yesterday's decision by the State Council, while the people of the whole country know that the unrest of the Chinese Communist Party cannot be resolved without intensifying military measures, they always hope that the war will not escalate. Now this hope has been shattered. The Chinese Communist Party relies on force, and we must defeat it with force. Under these circumstances, there are two points that must be stated:

(1) From a negative perspective, the Chinese Communist Party not only seizes territory and arms itself to rebel, but also colludes with foreign forces. This behavior violates the provisions of the "Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China" and should be punished according to national law to correct people's hearts. It is a pity that the "Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China" was abolished with the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. What is regrettable is that the crime of endangering the Republic of China cannot be avoided because of the abolition of this law. The Communist Party certainly endangers the Republic of China, and others who sympathize with the Communist Party and have actions also endanger the Republic of China; therefore, what we want to propose at this time is that, in view of the decision of the State Council, we hope that the government can re-announce the continued validity of the "Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China." The harm of the Chinese Communist Party to the Republic of China is not limited to the war zone, and the rear is not immune. We are not surprised to put China back in a state of war, but we hope that the rear and the war zone are equally important, and the mobilization order and the law on endangering the Republic of China are equally valued; therefore, after total mobilization, we hope that the "Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China" can be re-implemented.

(2) From a positive perspective, there are various objective reasons for the rampant behavior of the Chinese Communist Party. To eliminate the Chinese Communist Party, it is better to start from politics than from military affairs. Politics and military affairs are inseparable. If our politics are enlightened, what excuse can the Chinese Communist Party have? Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with quelling the Chinese Communist Party; we must improve politics so that the people can know where to go. Moreover, in the point of improving politics, we cannot only use democracy as a slogan; democracy without people's livelihood as its foundation is also futile. The only task of the government today is to stabilize people's livelihood; only when people's livelihood is stable can there be democracy, which is the third point we should recognize.

### From Price Negotiations to the Resumption of Cultivation Movement

The main causes of price fluctuations are nothing more than two: the quantity of goods and the quantity of currency. Therefore, to regulate prices, stabilize prices, or suppress prices, only by starting from these two places can we find a fundamental solution.

Because in the past, most of the methods were trivial and palliative in nature; they failed to promote the above two methods in a practical, systematic, and large-scale manner. Therefore, the more prices were stabilized, the more they fluctuated, and the more they were suppressed, the more they rose. Now, due to various relationships, although some people still advocate replaying the old tune, hoping to use extraordinary and simple means to suppress the rising prices, most people inevitably have some doubts about these means, and they can only hope for currency and production.

This article does not discuss the reorganization of the currency system and the consolidation of currency value, but focuses on production. That is to say, how to increase the quantity of production so that supply can gradually meet demand to stabilize or lower its prices.

In terms of production, it can be divided into two major parts: 1. Handicrafts, 2. Agricultural products. At present, it is particularly important to strive to increase agricultural products. The reason is very simple: most of the people in our country are still engaged in agriculture. Increasing agricultural production, on the one hand, solves their livelihood, and on the other hand, it increases a large amount of materials that can be used for consumption, manufacturing, and even for export, foreign exchange, tax revenue, and abundant food, while reducing unemployment, reducing thieves, improving public security, suppressing prices, and so on. Don't you see the predicament of many factories now? They cannot apply for foreign exchange, and they cannot import raw materials, so they are faced with the risk of closing down. The rural areas are in decline, the purchasing power of most people is declining, and they are faced with the pain of stagnation and difficulty in sales, and unsmooth turnover. Judging from this, the increase in the production of handicrafts still depends on the increase in the production of agricultural products; the cause and effect are very obvious. Therefore, it is not necessary to talk about increasing production, but if we want to talk about increasing production, although we should start with agricultural products, there is no doubt about this.

So, why don't we start here quickly? We must know that in the past and now, it is not that we absolutely ignore the rural areas, nor is it that we have done nothing, but that the methods adopted are too impractical and untimely.

Any plan must adapt to the environment. Medicine that is not right for the disease is the same as no medicine, or even aggravates the inherent disease. Therefore, simply copying other people's prescriptions or talking about pathology, ignoring the actual clinical diagnosis, is definitely not permitted by the principle of prescribing medicine according to the disease. The current rural area is a disease that occurs at the same time; its condition is indeed too complicated. Roughly speaking, such as: (1) Natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and hail, (2) Insect pests such as locusts, (3) Man-made disasters such as civil strife, bandits, corvée, apportionment, service, and requisition, (4) Lack of seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools, and funds, (5) Backward technology, (6) Disrepair of water conservancy, (7) Dumping of foreign goods, (8) Stagnation of sales of export goods, etc. And the most serious fatal injuries are:

First, strong men abandon their fields and scatter to all directions;

Second, they want to cultivate but have no capital, and vast fields are barren;

Third, agricultural products cannot be proportional to other prices, and the same price rises, resulting in deeper poverty;

Fourth, exploitation is too heavy, and the people cannot live;

Fifth, family handicrafts are defeated by emerging enterprises and foreign goods, and the path of sideline occupations

If we can prescribe the right medicine for the disease, aim at the above-mentioned diseases, and quickly catch up and treat them separately, it will not be difficult to gradually improve over time. Moreover, items (1) and (4) are all due to human affairs, and it is not difficult to reform them. As long as we are open and honest, eliminate troubles and remove abuses, so that farmers have a career to enjoy and a place to live in peace, we do not need to comfort and recruit them, and they will naturally return to agriculture and reorganize their fields and life. As for item (2), agricultural funds and fertilizers, seeds, agricultural tools, etc., there are now many agricultural financial institutions and many foreign relief items. If we can simplify procedures, distribute them properly, not concentrate on limited areas and businesses, and not focus on cumbersome procedures and forms, then the daily count will be insufficient, and the annual count may be more than enough. The only thing that is relatively difficult to achieve rapid results and must be promoted, guided, and gradually grown is item (5), sideline occupations.

What are the actual countermeasures now? The economic reform plan proposed by the Executive Yuan is relatively concrete; among them, the item of developing agriculture lists nine measures: (1) Reform the distribution relationship of agricultural land, and try to realize the principle that those who cultivate have their own land; (2) Hold collective farms, use new machines, and methods; (3) Issue public bonds and actively build water conservancy; (4) Expand cooperatives to facilitate agricultural loans; (5) Actively and universally build a warehouse system; (6) Widely set up nursery countries; (7) Train technology and develop sideline occupations; (8) Develop animal husbandry, (9) Reward fishery. If this plan is only viewed from the text, it can naturally be regarded as a well-organized and orderly plan; however, if we investigate it from the facts, we will find that there are still several shortcomings, which are all obvious. First, most of them are time-consuming and require a long period of preparation; they are not suitable for emergency use; second, items (1), (2), (3), and (5) may not be able to be implemented at least at present; third, those who cultivate their own land are supporting the small-peasant system, which is not consistent with the nature of collective farms that use new machines; fourth, many of the most serious fatal injuries in the current rural areas mentioned in the previous article are not touched. We dare not be self-righteous and say that we are right. However, the current rural areas have reached the point where they need emergency rescue, and the increase in agricultural products cannot be expected after a long period of time, and it does not necessarily have to wait until after a long period of time. This seems to always be the case. Therefore, while we are trying to cure the root cause, we cannot but quickly treat the symptoms. Moreover, stabilizing the rural areas, farmers returning to cultivation, eliminating troublesome matters, and relieving suffering, these are indeed measures to treat the symptoms; but they are also not a plan to cure the root cause. If the scattered farmers cannot be made to return to cultivation, and the agricultural products they grow cannot be made profitable, then even if the land is redistributed and the farm tools are mechanized, and the technology is scientific, the peasants will still stop plowing and sigh on the ridge, and I don't know who will use these lands and new machines? Labor is one of the factors of production. Without labor, there is no production, and how can we talk about increasing production? The proverb says: "If there are many who produce and few who consume, then wealth will always be sufficient." If we want to hope to control objects with objects and control objects with quantity, then we have to focus on the increase of agricultural products. To demand the increase of agricultural products, we have to demand the so-called resumption of cultivation movement as soon as possible.

### Truman Delivers Independence Day Speech: Discusses Prerequisites for Peace and Indirectly Criticizes Soviet Policy

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The US President recently delivered a broadcast speech at President Jefferson's former residence to commemorate American Independence. He called on Americans and countries around the world to break down artificial barriers so that they are not isolated from each other, and urged mutual tolerance so that knowledge and ideals leading to a harmonious world can be freely exchanged. Mr. Truman praised President Jefferson's philosophy of "inalienable rights," a truth that has now been incorporated into the United Nations Charter. He pointed out four key conditions for peace: (1) Common compliance with the just authority of government, which comes from the consent of the governed; (2) Common respect for the fundamental rights of mankind; (3) Full and free exchange of all kinds of knowledge, ideals, and information by people around the world; International travel and communication should be granted the greatest freedom; (4) Countries should formulate financial and economic policies to support the world economy, rather than individual nationalist economies.

[Agence France-Presse, Charlottesville, Virginia, 4th Dispatch] President Truman delivered a severe speech here today, severely criticizing the Soviet Union's opposition to Secretary of State Marshall's economic aid plan. Although he did not directly mention Molotov's name, everything he said was criticizing the Soviet Union's ability, which led to the failure of the Paris Economic Conference. His wording was severe and straightforward. He said that this opposition to Marshall's proposal was like a person refusing to jointly run a profitable business on the grounds that it would interfere with his private affairs, which is absurd. Lack of trust between countries is the main cause of war. Countries that live in peace with each other should especially establish political and economic cooperative relations. The United States has fulfilled all its obligations to establish a peaceful economic state, but it is not enough for only one country to abide by its responsibility to revive the world. This requires cooperation between all countries to achieve this complete success. Food, clothing, and housing are still urgent needs, and they still need the efforts of all countries to solve them. In terms of foreign anti-American propaganda, a certain number of countries are deliberately distorting the facts of other countries and propagating them to their own people, causing them to distrust or despise their neighbors. This kind of action is misleading the people and runs counter to the efforts to create peace and unity. Today, there are some countries whose governments are restricting public opinion. We must know that the stronger the voice to formulate national policies with public opinion, the more the crisis of aggression can be reduced. Therefore, if governments can follow public opinion, then permanent peace is hopeful. Our goal is not only to seek peace for the present, but also to seek permanent peace.

### British Foreign Secretary Returns to London; French Foreign Ministry Denies Reports of Bidault's Visit to Britain

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned here by plane from Paris at 3:20 PM today. The Foreign Secretary took off from Paris at 1:52 PM. Before leaving, he met with French Foreign Minister Bidault and talked for two hours.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Prime Minister Attlee this morning to report on the results of the recent Paris Conference.

### Other Countries Participating in European Conference: The Soviet Union Should Not Obstruct

[Our Dispatch] London, 4th Broadcast: A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated that the Soviet Union's attempt to intimidate countries invited to participate in the European Recovery Conference is tantamount to infringing upon the sovereignty of those countries. They further stated that the UK and France leave it entirely to the invited countries to decide whether or not to participate, but they must choose either attendance or non-attendance, and will not be allowed to participate in the conference as "observers." Another report: Personnel at the Paris Foreign Ministry anticipate that Poland and Czechoslovakia, despite their close ties with the Soviet Union, may accept the invitation to attend the European Recovery Conference scheduled for July 12th.

### General Eisenhower's Speech Advocates Strengthening Peace Organizations

[Agence France-Presse, Vicksburg, Mississippi, 4th Dispatch] Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered a speech here today, on American Independence Day, forcefully stating that the United States will advance its mission of establishing a global pacification mechanism, even if its proposals and charitable actions are misinterpreted. General Eisenhower stated that the world still lacks a strong international organization to mediate disputes and enforce resolutions. If the United States does not contribute to the establishment of a world peace organization, humanity will suffer the catastrophe of a third world war. The United States deeply understands that no single nation, no matter how strong or wealthy, can guarantee its own security; in essence, all nations must cooperate because the United States itself cannot establish future defense plans alone.

### General MacArthur's Article Condemns Despotic Nations

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd Dispatch] In commemoration of American Independence Day, General MacArthur sent a letter to "Life Magazine," stating: "When despotism controls the lives of the people and plunges other nations into the shackles of its enslavement, peace will be hindered, and the crisis of war will loom large." General MacArthur did not specify the nation practicing despotism, but there is no doubt as to whom he was referring. He specifically called upon the American people in the letter to "fulfill our responsibility to other peoples with a spirit of great fearlessness" and to lead them towards a world of peace and seek good human relations.

### General MacArthur's Military Parade in Tokyo

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 4th Dispatch] Today, in celebration of American Independence Day, the first grand military parade since the war was held in the plaza in front of the Japanese Imperial Palace.

### Failure of the Paris Three-Foreign Ministers Conference May Impact UK-Soviet Trade Negotiations

[Reuters, Moscow, 3rd Dispatch] Well-informed sources stated tonight that the failure of the Paris Three-Foreign Ministers Conference and the UK's decision to continue pursuing the Marshall Plan despite the Soviet Union's attitude may have a serious impact on the current UK-Soviet trade negotiations.

[Reuters, London, 3rd Dispatch] Although the UK has broken with the Soviet Union at the Paris Conference, it will continue to advance its trade expansion plans in Eastern Europe. According to a government spokesperson today, the cabinet has considered this issue, and Prime Minister Attlee spoke by phone with Foreign Secretary Bevin in Paris. Bevin returns here tonight and plans to meet with Attlee immediately. A Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the cabinet may convene a special meeting. British officials expect several Eastern European countries to refuse to participate in the Paris Conference on July 12th, but British trade delegations in the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Yugoslavia will still negotiate trade agreements with those countries. It is expected that the UK will advance its foreign trade policy based on multilateral and reciprocal principles, without excluding any country.

### Various Countries Considering Responses to Invitations from the British and French Governments; Secretary Marshall Supports UK and France's Efforts to Unite Europe

[Reuters, London, 3rd Dispatch] The governments of the UK and France have sent invitations to the governments of twenty-two European nations, inviting them to convene in Paris on July 12th to jointly discuss the Marshall Plan for European aid. The governments of these countries are all considering their responses tonight. At the same time, Secretary of State Marshall has assured the UK and France in Washington, expressing support for the efforts of the UK and France to unite Europe in response to the aid plan.

A summary of the reactions of European countries is as follows: A spokesperson for the Swedish Foreign Ministry denied the Paris report that Sweden fears the Soviet Union and does not dare to participate in the planning under the Marshall Plan. Semi-official sources also stated that Sweden is eager to participate in this work. The Czech cabinet is expected to meet on Friday to seriously consider whether to participate in the Marshall Plan and the conference convened by the UK and France. The participation of the Czech Republic in the Eastern or Western camp is approaching the final decision stage. It is generally believed that although the Czech Republic has a political alliance with the East, it still relies heavily on the West in other respects. Political figures in Vienna, Austria, expect Austria to decide to accept the invitation from the UK and France. A spokesperson for the Socialist Party stated that accepting the invitation from the UK and France is not enough to indicate Austria's affiliation with the Western bloc. The moderate factions and opposition parties in Hungary originally placed great hope on the talks between the UK, France, and the Soviet Union in Paris; the failure of the negotiations has deeply disappointed them. Italian public opinion can generally be seen in the Rome independent newspaper "Messaggero," which stated that "the cornerstone of the Western bloc has been laid by the Soviet representatives. Within a few days, the UK and France will begin to build walls on this cornerstone."

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The governments of the UK and France have formally invited the governments of twenty-two European countries to send representatives to meet in Paris on July 12th to jointly discuss the Marshall Plan for European aid. These twenty-two countries are Portugal, Ireland, Iceland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Austria, and Turkey. According to a spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry, accepting the invitation only indicates acceptance of the French plan in principle; any country participating in the July 12th conference may propose amendments. Spain has not been invited for the time being, the intention being that if there is a change in the Spanish government, it will be invited to participate in the conference. Regarding the German portion of the French plan, the commanders-in-chief of the various German zones have agreed to cooperate in the exchange of materials between the German zones and with other countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, French Foreign Minister Bidault and British Foreign Secretary Bevin held a meeting this morning, deciding to continue discussing the Marshall Plan for European aid, even if the Soviet Union stays out of it. The UK and France have sent letters to the Soviet ambassador to France, Bogomolov, informing him that invitations have been sent and explaining that the governments of the UK and France hope that the Soviet Union's refusal to participate is not a final decision and that it can still participate in discussions on the European economic recovery plan.

### Establishment of Indonesian News; Cold Reaction from the Netherlands; Believes It Cannot Improve Relations

[Special Correspondent, Batavia, 3rd Dispatch] According to reliable sources: Political figures in the Netherlands believe that the formation of a new government in the Indonesian Republic, with former Defense Minister Sjahrir as Prime Minister, will not have a positive impact on relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia.

### Marshall's Economic Aid to Europe Plan May Face Difficulty in Gaining Congressional Support; Many Points of Disagreement Between Congress and the Government

[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] American diplomats believe that the Soviet Union's rejection of the Marshall Plan makes it easier to allocate funds solely to aid Western Europe, but this matter generated dangerous signals in Congress on the 4th.

A series of events have made some diplomats, who were willing to present the plan to Congress, hesitant. Passing an additional tens of billions of dollars, even if specifically for European use, will, according to official opinion, become a "superficial proposal." Officials believe that the recent developments in Congress include the following facts worth noting: First, Rep. Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, issued a statement saying that the State Department has failed to explain the justification for the $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey, and to date, several items have not been designated for use in that plan. Second, Taber opposed allocating $370 million to authorize the State Department for foreign relief for the same reason, a portion of which would be allocated to Western Europe and a portion to China. Third, Senator Taft criticized the State Department's request to extend import and export controls for another year, so that scarce commodities could be evenly distributed, as inappropriate. Taft specifically opposed continuing to control fats and oils, the lack of which is most serious. State Department officials deeply fear that this reaction from Congress will affect timid European countries, making them afraid to resolutely participate in the Western European economic self-reliance plan. They point out that if there is doubt about Congress allocating additional funds to aid Europe, the Marshall Plan is in danger of collapse. This development will greatly benefit the Soviet Union.

### U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Advocates Ending the Collection of Reparations from Germany and Japan

[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee submitted a report today stating that the United States must insist on ending the collection of reparations from Germany and Japan so that the economies of those two countries can become self-sufficient. The submission of this report comes the day after Molotov rejected Secretary of State Marshall's European recovery plan and states, "We do not believe this is the end of U.S. aid to Europe." The report estimates that European recovery will require the United States to provide $10 billion in loans or grants from 1947 to 1949, including the UK but excluding the Soviet Union.

### Political Merger of the British and American Occupation Zones in Germany Moves Closer; General Clay and Harriman Arrive in Berlin Together

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch] General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in Germany, stated in a conversation with reporters here today, "I hope the failure of the Paris Three-Foreign Ministers Conference will not increase the difficulty of unifying Germany, but any situation that makes Germany and the unification work more difficult will make the trend toward our political merger closer." When asked if there are any developments that could bring the British and American zones closer to political merger before the London Foreign Ministers Conference in November, he replied that it is certainly not being considered at this time. When asked whether the failure of the Paris Conference would lead to a merger of the French zone with the British and American zones, Clay said that if France is willing to participate, the UK and the US would be very happy. Clay also said that Moses, the New York City Commissioner of Construction, has arrived in Germany at his invitation to study the housing problem in the Ruhr region and suggest steps to increase coal production. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman and Secretary of Agriculture Anderson arrived in Berlin today for the same purpose. After obtaining the approval of the British authorities, they will inspect the British military zone. Clay also said that Harriman will study Germany's export problems, and Anderson will investigate Germany's food situation.

### Equipment Worth Over 10 Billion Sold at Auction for Over 1 Million; Qingdao Renfeng Yarn Factory Sues the Central Trust Bureau

[Our Dispatch] The Qingdao Renfeng Yarn Factory, operated by the Bank of China, recently filed a lawsuit with the local court in this city, accusing Wu Rencang, the director of the Central Trust Bureau and concurrently the director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, and He Shengdi, the manager of Wufuji in Gujia Lane 51, Beijing Road, of improper sale, requesting a judgment that the sales contract is invalid. The original complaint stated: The Renfeng Yarn Factory is operated jointly by the Qingdao branch of the Bank of China. Before the War of Resistance, it ordered a 160063 turbine generator from the UK, totaling 39 boxes, which arrived in Shanghai in the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940]. 33 boxes were transferred by the Bank of China and stored in the bank's Suzhou River warehouse. The remaining six boxes were stored at the Blue Eyed Pier due to their large size and inconvenient transportation. Subsequently, the Pacific War broke out, the pier was occupied by Japanese invaders, and the generator was seized. After the victory, Zhu Yuqiu, a staff member of the Qingdao branch of the Bank of China stationed in Shanghai, went to supervise the Blue Eyed Pier

### Large and Small Cinemas Brewing Price Increases

[Our Dispatch] Amidst the rising prices of various goods, the ticket prices of large and small cinemas in this city are brewing adjustments again. The cinema industry has held preliminary consultations, but in view of the considerable twists and turns in the previous request for price increases, it is planned to first collect detailed information on the business conditions of each cinema to prove that the income and expenses of most cinemas cannot be offset, so as to invite the permission of the authorities. These days, cinemas are rushing to settle the accounts for the previous month for submission to the industry association for compilation, and then formally requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to approve price increases.

### Planning to Strengthen Economic Supervision; Discussing the Establishment of a Joint Office

Police Bureau Director Yu told reporters yesterday afternoon that in order to strengthen the implementation of economic supervision and unify the pace, he has formally submitted a suggestion to Mayor Wu to establish joint offices for gold notes, cotton cloth, food, and fuel. Mayor Wu agreed to submit it to the next Economic Supervision Committee report for discussion and decision. It is generally expected that this suggestion is in line with the needs and can be approved, possibly with Mayor Wu concurrently serving as the director of the office, and Yu Shuping and Wu Kaixian concurrently serving as deputy directors. It was found that of the six large boxes of equipment, except for one box that had been removed by the Japanese invaders, the remaining five boxes were still there, but had been taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and were being requested by the bank for return. Unexpectedly, the equipment had been handed over to the customs by the bureau for auction, and was sold to Wufuji for 1,768,000 legal currency. The Bank of China believes that the value of the equipment is approximately over 10 billion yuan, but it was sold at auction for only a meager price of over 1 million yuan. If new items are reordered, it will take at least two years, so it filed a lawsuit against the Central Trust Bureau Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office and Wufuji, requesting a judgment: (1) Confirming that the act of auctioning five pieces of turbine generator equipment is invalid. (2) Allowing the plaintiff to hand over 1,768,000 legal currency to Wufuji after Tian Yuangao delivers the above equipment, and Wufuji is responsible for returning it. (3) Allowing the plaintiff to provide a deposit to declare a provisional execution. (4) The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant. This case will be heard in court by the local court in the coming days.

### The Gold Rush Case Will be Investigated on the 7th; Summons Issued to Xu Busun to Testify on Market Conditions; Part of Zhang Liansheng's Case to be Heard Today

### Profit and Loss Tax for the 36th Year [of the Republic, i.e. 1947] to Implement "Standard Tax Assessment"

[Our Dispatch] According to the Director of the Direct Tax Bureau, Yuan Quandi, who told reporters that the "standard tax assessment" for the profit and loss tax for the 36th year has been implemented yesterday.

### Huge Swindle; Spouting Nonsense; Impersonating Director of National Bank's Foreign Exchange Control Office; "Training Children" to Lure People into Trap; Li Yuexuan Lured by Profit Sues for Justice

[Report from Our Newspaper] In June of last year, Li Yuexuan of Henan and others were introduced by a friend to Zhang Ruoyu, who claimed to be the Director of the Foreign Exchange Control Office of the Central Bank. Zhang, posing as a high-ranking military and political figure, falsely claimed to represent the American United Oil Company, identifying Cai Wenwei as the company's representative, and declared his intention to develop business in China, asserting that anyone who could order 10,000 barrels of kerosene would obtain the position of general manager. Zhang also fabricated a so-called "Zhitong New Construction Silver Company," a financial group affiliated with the Central Political Clique, claiming that it had funds of US$70 million and that he was its representative, promising to support Li with financial resources. Li then signed a contract with Cai to purchase 10,000 barrels of kerosene, paying a deposit of 30 million yuan. Zhang falsely claimed to "lend" the remaining amount, and Cai issued a receipt for US$119,250. Subsequently, after promoting sales in the Henan area, setting a price of 1,350 barrels of kerosene, and collecting 155.359 million yuan in kerosene payments, Cai and others continued to stall for more than two months. By this time, customers waiting for the kerosene were extremely anxious and suspicious. After inquiring from various sources, they learned that Zhang's claims of holding various important positions were purely fraudulent. It is reported that Zhang frequently mentioned President Song and Minister He, speaking with the air of an important figure, and trained his concubine, Liu Meihe, and several young daughters. Every time they saw a photo of Chairman Chiang, they would call him "adoptive grandfather," and he would make these young daughters say they had been to his home with their mother, making people deeply believe him and allowing him to carry out his fraudulent activities. The so-called "United Oil Company" did not exist, and there were no millions of barrels of oil. The only thing they had to stall with was the receipt for about one-tenth of the deposit paid to Dahua Company last September for purchasing 1,000 boxes of Texaco kerosene. Zhang claimed to be a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy, and under the "Service Unit" section of his national identification card, he wrote "Member of the Military Affairs Commission." He was arrested by the Garrison Command on May 23rd and released on June 12th. Now, Li and others have filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Zhang, Cai, and Liu Meihe of jointly plotting to defraud and requesting an investigation, as well as demanding the return of 409 large barrels of kerosene containing 53 plus gallons. Yesterday, Judge Cao Fuwei interrogated Cai alone, as the plaintiff was not present. After the court inquired briefly, it was determined that the details needed to be presented by the plaintiff himself, and the hearing was rescheduled.

### English Tests at American Universities Do Not Hinder Foreign Students' Pursuit of Studies

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd dispatch] It has recently been learned from authoritative sources that English tests conducted by American universities for foreign students are not a necessary condition for students from China and other countries to obtain visas for studying in the United States. Whether the English test is passed is determined by each school itself. Therefore, the test does not affect foreign students' ability to obtain visas, except when permission from an American university is a necessary condition for applying for a visa. If a foreign student fails an English test at one university, he can still apply to other schools that do not require the test. Therefore, the English test does not hinder foreign students from pursuing studies in the United States. Whether American universities adopt the test method also varies from school to school. This type of test will be administered by the University Entrance Examination Committee and funded by the State Department. The committee originally handled entrance examinations for American universities, but it also often decides on other educational policies or plans. The English test for foreign students is one such example. The details of the committee's tests for foreign students are not yet known, but the policies it has adopted historically have been extremely fair.

### Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association Decides on Common Distribution Regulations, Detailed Measures to be Studied by Subcommittee

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at approximately 3 PM yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Wang Qiyu and adjourned at approximately 6 PM.

There were five important reports yesterday: (A) The Textile Regulation Committee's handling of the joint distribution case: This case was discussed in detail by the Textile Regulation Committee's third committee meeting, which believed that the principle of joint distribution was still feasible. However, the detailed measures should be determined separately within two weeks. However, temporary joint distribution will be carried out from Monday, the 20th of this month. The method is that state-owned and private yarn mills each submit 10,000 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn to the Textile Regulation Committee for distribution (handled by the Product Distribution Subcommittee of the Textile Regulation Committee, supervised by the Business Department). From the 20th of this month, the yarn should be delivered in equal installments over 15 days. The cotton yarn to be delivered by private yarn mills should be sent to the Textile Regulation Committee for verification and receipt by the Sixth District Association.

The Sixth District Association has drafted five common distribution regulations and prepared a calculation table and reservation form for distribution to member factories for verification and implementation. The common distribution regulations are as follows:

1.  The total amount of cotton yarn for this distribution is 20,000 bales of 20-count yarn, with state-owned factories and private factories each accounting for 10,000 bales. The private factories are calculated based on the number of spindles started in March according to the cotton allocation survey form for the 41 factories in Shanghai and the 26 factories in other cities that recently received cotton.

2.  Each factory should issue a reservation form for the amount of 20-count cotton yarn allocated according to the allocation table and send it to the Sixth District Association, which will forward it to the Textile Regulation Committee for distribution. This reservation form should be issued for each piece of yarn, or several reservation forms may be issued for half the amount of yarn.

3.  The Textile Regulation Committee will distribute based on the reservation forms sent by each factory. After receiving the reservation form distributed by the Textile Regulation Committee, each factory should immediately collect the payment and exchange it for a warehouse receipt.

4.  The deadline for factories to send reservation forms is July 5th, and they should be sent to the Sixth District Association for forwarding to the Textile Regulation Committee. The goods should be delivered in full by July 15th. If the distribution has not been completed by the deadline, they should reserve the goods for delivery at any time.

5.  The "Total Value" column of the reservation form should be filled in by the Textile Regulation Committee according to the negotiated price at the time of distribution. The "Distribution Period" item should also be filled in by the Textile Regulation Committee. (B) The prices of cotton yarn of various counts have been ordered and announced by the Textile Regulation Committee's Pricing Subcommittee. It is hoped that member factories will strictly abide by them.

Among the discussed cases, the main one was to study the detailed measures for joint distribution. It was resolved that a subcommittee of seven people, including Tong Runfu, Han Zhiming, Zhang Wenqian, Liu Jingji, and Ye Erren, would be formed to specialize in research in order to formulate a specific plan to be submitted to the Textile Regulation Committee meeting to be held on the 8th for discussion.

### Buying Sentiment Suddenly Turns Strong, Most Chinese Stocks Rebound, China Rich and Diligence Allied Rise to Limit

The stock market initially opened flat yesterday, then became active. Yong'an Yarn was repeatedly advancing and returning, showing signs of hesitation, but small stocks such as China Rich and New Light were very stable. In particular, China Rich Enamelware had a new look, progressing steadily and reaching the limit first. After this change, the buying opportunity exceeded the limit, and the situation turned around. As a result, the market price of Yong'an Yarn felt very worthwhile. The Bank of China helped to absorb it first, and active elements took the opportunity to surpass it. The trading floor suddenly appeared exhausted, and off-market interest rates decreased to 2.4 to 2.85%. At noon, there was a general reaction, and many miscellaneous stocks reached their limit. However, the future will depend on the movement of the money supply.

In the early morning, people still had no interest. Among the spot stocks, only China Sports opened slightly higher, while the remaining stocks did not open at all. When Yong'an Yarn entered the market, it also saw a slight increase. After opening, numbers 71, 65, 142, 14, 224, 232, 228, and 212 showed eager demand. Number 177 even advanced to the spot Yong'an Yarn, pushing the forward Yong'an Yarn up to 8500 yuan. Numbers 157 and 85 took the opportunity to sell, while numbers 190, 183, and 32 were still buying, forming a saw-tooth pattern. Numbers 73, 85, 128, and 223 concluded their transactions and lowered the price to within 8400 yuan. Numbers 185 and 4 bought the spot Yong'an Yarn, and number 222 also purchased the forward Yong'an Yarn, pushing the price back up to above 8500 yuan. Number 17 had supply and struggled slightly. Number 157 once bought in, and numbers 160, 142, and 22 advanced further to 8600 yuan. Numbers 73, 157, 231, Er Xi, 110, 22, 76, Ji Yi, and 83 all sold out, lowering the price to 8350 yuan. Numbers 106, 235, and 180 took advantage of the low price to advance to 8470 yuan. Number 157's willingness to sell did not diminish, while number 102 advanced, causing the price to hover again.

Later, numbers 61, 171, and 157 competed to acquire the spot Yong'an Yarn, while numbers 148 and 71 sold the forward Yong'an Yarn, and number 48 also had supply, causing the price to be forced down to around 8270 yuan. The spot Yong'an Yarn then retreated to around 8100 yuan. Numbers 215, 224, and 12 Heaven took advantage of the low price to advance to 8450 yuan. Numbers 91 and 219 were still selling at within 8300 yuan. Afterwards, due to the constant advances of various small stocks and miscellaneous brands, China Rich, under the leadership of number 107, revitalized and was first pulled to the limit by numbers 107 and 8. As a result, in a situation where everyone felt that it was extremely cheap, Yong'an Yarn also aroused speculative sentiment. Numbers 207 and 31, the bank gang, and active elements, numbers 224, 160, and 4, and numbers 232, 65, 158, 41, 8, and 32 all came to compete for purchases, gradually increasing the price. The approaching of the closing was even more enthusiastic. Diligence Allied and New China Li'an approached the limit and had transactions. Yong Mud, led by number 174, National Goods, led by number 153, and China France, led by number 59, all reached their limit. The forward Yong'an Yarn then rose to 8750 yuan, and the spot Yong'an Yarn also ended at a high price of 8430 yuan. After the close, number 14 and others had buy orders, calling a high price of 8800.

As a result, compared to the previous closing, the spot stocks of China Rich and Diligence Allied rose to the limit, King Fu rose by 10%, and Yong'an Yarn, Faith Harmony, New Light, and Yong Gong each rose by about 5%. US Asia rose slightly, New China and China France also reached the limit, Business Rich slightly decreased, United China was flat, Matches Underwear rose by 5%, and China Textile King Lun Cement each rose by about 10%. The remaining stocks only saw a slight increase. Among the forward stocks, China Rich rose to the limit, King Fu rose by 10%, and Yong'an Yarn and New Light each rose by 5%, with US Asia Harmony rising slightly. Among the off-market old stocks, Great Life China rose slightly, while World South Ocean Zhabei China Business Five Continents all appeared stable.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Weak

Government bonds were weak yesterday as settlements decreased. Number 555 sold out, and Unified C opened at 7300 yuan, starting from 76600 and falling to a low price of 6300 yuan at the close. Compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds fell by 710 yuan, Class C fell by 1100 yuan, Class D fell by 600 yuan, and Class E also fell by a small amount of 400 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 1 million.

Foreign stocks continued to decline yesterday. Although foreign merchants and securities firms were buying, gold shops and Guang merchants were selling, causing the stocks to be weak overall. The sparse trading volume led to an oversupply. As a result, compared to the previous close, Paper Industry fell by slightly over 10%, Shipping was flat, Yi He Industry Guang fell slightly, and the remaining stocks each fell by about 5%.

### Artificial Silk Stabilizes After Falling, Factory Silk Market Slightly Higher

The artificial silk market initially opened flat yesterday and then strengthened. Number 120 Heavenly Bridge New Loan opened at 24.7 million yuan, and Hsu Zi called 4.5 million yuan. Because practical sales accounts came to slightly absorb, the market turned better, gradually rising. At the noon close, Hsu Zi was 25 million yuan, and the Heavenly Bridge New Goods was 100,000 yuan higher. In the afternoon, the stock market rose, and factory silk also appeared strong. Silk factories continued to buy, making the market even more brisk. The final transaction was at 5.6 million yuan, 1 million yuan higher than the previous day's price. Number 75 Golden Chicken Half-Light called prices rose accordingly.

Yesterday's factory warp market was slightly higher than the previous day, and trading was fairly active. Grade C was traded at 32.51 million yuan, Grade D opened at 2 million yuan, and Grade E at 1.5 million yuan also had transactions. However, all had several days of lead time. Grade AB had very little inventory in the market, and calling prices were higher. No sales were made yesterday. The dry warp market was quieter. Five-bundle lots called for prices were still at the price of 22 million yuan, and small lots were 19.5 to 20 million yuan.

Yesterday's silk market saw Big Sincerity face fabric trade at 2.3 to 2.35 million yuan, and Better Fabric between 2.2 and 2.25 million yuan. Big Grid Wall Cloth always hovered between 41,200 and 41,300 yuan, the smallest being 100 yuan, and the final transaction was 300 yuan, with next-day trading at 1,400-1,500 yuan, 500 yuan higher than the previous day. China Splendor Crepe high-end goods traded at 212,500 yuan, and secondary goods traded at 25300 yuan. Asia's Ling Peike was very popular, with high-end goods trading at 345,000 yuan and secondary goods trading at 323,000 yuan. The remaining goods remained firm.

Cotton Market Flat and Weak

Due to falling yarn prices, the current cotton market was trending weak. However, high-end cotton was still in demand from fine yarn mills because of the brisk fine yarn prices, making it difficult for prices to fall much. The common grades were not in high demand, and prices were softer. Customers were not willing to sell cheaply because of poor sources and low inventory in Shanghai. Trading was slightly more active than the previous day. The factory prices for various grades were: Bao 2.02 million, Shashi special 1.92 million. Spot exchange prices were planned at 1.87 to 1.98 million, Shashi at 1.85 million, US Metre Lin at 1.97 million, Hankou fine velvet at 1.6 million, Chong Zhou at 1.61 million, South Pacific Innovation at 1.61 million, Donggou at 16 million, Pudong Fire Machine at 1.44 million, 1.5 to 1.55 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 265,000 to 285,000 per bundle.

### Testing and Methods, Production and Sales Association Corrects and Approves

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce's Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee held its tenth meeting at 2 PM yesterday at 116 Wujin Road. Over 20 people were present, including Chu Fucheng and Tan Xihong. The meeting was chaired by Tan Suhong. The following important cases were discussed and resolved: (1) The testing method for silkworm cocoons received from this spring's loans has been formulated and submitted for discussion. The resolution was to correct and approve it. (2) The supplementary measures for settlement prices and cocoon collection expenses were submitted for discussion. The resolution was to correct and approve them. (3) The case for compensation for war-time losses in the silk industry was resolved to collect materials, list them, and submit them to the relevant authorities for review. (4) The price and quantity of silkworm eggs for this year's autumn silkworms, and the issue of subsidies for egg prices, were resolved to be quickly studied by the silkworm egg subcommittee and submitted to the meeting for discussion.

### Buying Sentiment Weakens, Sales Stagnate, Food Prices Decline, High-Grade White Rice Decreases by Over 20,000 Yuan Yesterday

Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving in the North and South markets was over 5,600 shi. All grains declined across the board. Indica rice had sources arriving from various ports along the Yangtze River, as well as from the Jinpu Line and northern Jiangsu. Sales were stagnant, and there were no buyers, causing a continued sharp decline of 31,000 yuan. Japonica rice was the same, falling by 20,000 yuan, White Yuan Yin Yuan followed the decline by 1-20,000 yuan, and Medium Secondary Guest Yuan plunged by 230,000 yuan, with few inquiries.

Flour declined sharply, following the decline in the interior, and saw another sharp drop of 8-9,000 yuan. Foreign flour plummeted by 13-4,000 yuan, and bran plunged by 3-4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes had strong selling sentiment, declined in a straight line, and plummeted by 5-6,000 to 6-7,000 yuan. Soybeans also followed the decline in oil cakes and became sluggish, falling sharply by 3-5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Red beans were stable in Nanyang, but domestic sales were bleak, plunging by 2-30,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had few transactions in both Nanyang and domestic markets, plunging by 1-20,000 yuan. Red sorghum also shaved off 10,000 yuan. Corn declined again by 3-5,000 yuan. Broad beans were stable among guest merchants, down by 3-5,000 yuan. Factories had no desire for wheat and were waiting to see it fall further, declining again by 3-5,000 yuan. Mung beans had few arrivals and sales, remaining stable with Medium Secondary slightly higher by 10,000 yuan.

The oil market was full of selling sentiment. Buyers were waiting, and Hua Nan was stable. Goods from Yingkou had arrived, and Sichuan goods continued to arrive, causing market sentiment to be weak. Raw soybean oil and Clear Vegetable oil all plummeted by 30,000 yuan. Vegetable oil also decreased by 2-30,000 yuan, with cooked vegetable oil being the most sluggish. However, small cart rattan oil had more retail sales due to many vegetarians during the summer, forming a temporarily flat pattern.

Pilot Oil Rationing Before Mid-Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that the City Social Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau will cooperate to pilot one oil rationing before the 15th of this month. The rationing price will be softer than the market price. The oil to be rationed will be raw oil and soybean oil, and each person can ration half a catty of oil each time. According to the city's population survey at the end of May of this year, the total population is approximately 4.17 million people. Therefore, the amount of oil to be rationed at one time is estimated to be 2.0885 million catties. It is said that the Central Trust Bureau has prepared a month's worth of oil for continuous rationing to citizens.

### Coal Prices Rise Then Weaken
The price of coal, anthracite, and other fuels had risen sharply in recent days due to hoarding, leading to sluggish sales and a slight softening of the market. While anthracite prices remain unchanged, sales are weak. Only bituminous coal continues to sell well due to its relatively low price. However, the significant difference between current market prices and production costs may affect future deliveries. Firewood and charcoal prices remain high, and sales are rather slow.

### Financial Yearbook to be Published Soon
The "China Financial Yearbook," edited by the China Financial Yearbook Society for the 36th year, is a comprehensive national financial publication and will be published soon. It has been compiled over many years and consists of one million words divided into three sections.

### National Cement Association Requests Reduction of Cement Cargo Tax
[Our Reporter] The National Cement Association states that local cement cargo tax rates have been frequently adjusted recently. The special task of the cement industry in supplying construction needs is often overlooked, and the standards used are often inconsistent with reality. Therefore, it plans to send Directors Shi Naixiu, Secretary-General Chen Hanqing, and Deputy Secretary-General Xi Zhengxiu to Nanjing soon to meet with Director Jiang of the Tax Administration and present their case. The reasons for requesting a tax reduction are as follows:

(1) The target of the cargo tax should be the goods themselves. However, due to a lack of packaging materials and high prices, the average packaging cost for cement accounts for one-fourth of the total cost. Since packaging costs are not deducted, the actual tax payable is at least one-fourth higher than it should be.

(2) According to cargo tax regulations, the taxable price should be based on the average wholesale price in the market near the place of production over the past three months. If the main market for the cement produced is located elsewhere than near the factory, and the selling price there is much lower than the price near the place of production, it would be unfair to set the cargo tax rate based on the wholesale price at the place of production, where sales volume is minimal.

(3) Cement factories currently supply over 70% of their products to government agencies for construction purposes. However, local tax bureaus often base their tax rates on the wholesale prices of the small amount of cement sold on the market, which is unreasonable.

(4) The tax rate implemented in Shanghai starting June 16 was based on the average market wholesale price for May alone, which does not comply with the cargo tax regulations that require calculation based on the wholesale prices for March, April, and May. Negotiations are underway to reduce this tax rate, but it increased again to 7,200 yuan starting July 3, which is an unbearable burden.

International Cooperation Day Message
Cooperation or Destruction by Wang Shiying

Amid the chaos at home and abroad today, we must put forward such a slogan: "Cooperation or Destruction."

A recent Reuters report stated that Professor W. C. Allee of the University of Chicago, in an article for the 1947 Encyclopedia Britannica, pointed out that Darwin's theory of "survival of the fittest" is untenable. He believes that animals (including humans) are more inclined to cooperate than to engage in anti-social behavior. An animal's life is, in fact, governed by a law: cooperate or die.

It is human nature for individuals, societies, nations, and the world to strive for goodness, just as it is natural for humans to seek wisdom. The value of group survival can be traced back to primitive life. Social life is not accidental; rather, it is a normal, fundamental, and universal phenomenon.

In fact, what Professor Allee says about the principle of evolution is more of an explanation than an original idea. For the past century, those involved in cooperative movements in various countries have been striving for and adhering to this principle. In particular, Dr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out more profoundly that mutual assistance is a principle of human evolution. He said: "Humans were initially no different from animals. After tens of thousands of years of evolution, they gradually developed human nature, and this marked the origin of human evolution. The principle of evolution in this period is mutual assistance. Society and the nation are the embodiment of mutual assistance. Morality and righteousness are the application of mutual assistance. Humans prosper by following this principle and perish by violating it. This principle has been practiced by humans for hundreds of thousands of years. However, humans have not yet fully adhered to this principle because they originated from animals, and their entry into the third stage of evolution is recent, so they have not been able to completely eliminate all inherited traits from animals. However, since humans entered civilization, they have naturally and unconsciously moved towards the principle of mutual assistance in order to achieve the goal of human evolution. What is the goal of human evolution? It is what Confucius called 'The Great Way prevails when the world is for all,' and what Jesus called 'Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.' This is what humans hope for: to transform the current world of suffering into a paradise of bliss."

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's saying "Prosper by following this principle and perish by violating it" precisely points out the "iron law of cooperation or destruction."

The recent World War, on the surface, has ended, but in reality, the war continues, with flames reaching the sky and war clouds gathering. There is simply no pure land left in the universe. How can we not be filled with fear and anxiety in this situation? Looking around, we see that the principle of competition still has an overwhelming advantage in politics, economics, and society. People are driven by this principle to the point of madness. Gradual encroachment is no longer enough to describe its ferocity. What a terrible phenomenon this is! When we reflect on this late at night, how can we, who call ourselves the lords of creation, not feel ashamed?

Fortunately, after a century of development, the cooperative movement has gradually grown into a grand sight. At least in the economic field, it has shown the certainty of mutual assistance as a principle of evolution. This is the long-awaited good news from the empty valley, a refreshing drink in the sweltering summer, and a ray of warmth in the gloomy atmosphere.

Naturally, the cooperative movement has not yet reached a stage of complete success, especially in China, where it is still in its early stages. It cannot be said to be satisfactory. However, remembering the lesson of "cooperation or destruction," we must not be complacent or discouraged. We firmly believe that our choice is the smartest and most correct one. Competition is a remnant of animality, while cooperation is the development of humanity. Transforming competition into cooperation is the only key to human evolution.

Recalling the eve of the First World War, the International Cooperative Alliance, recognizing the increasing tensions between countries, issued a righteous call for peace. Unfortunately, the power of the cooperative movement was not enough to eliminate war, and the First World War finally broke out in 1914. As the Second World War was about to break out, the International Cooperative Alliance again made calls for peace, issuing declarations at the 16th and 17th International Cooperative Days in 1938 and 1939, respectively, one titled "Peace Through Cooperation" and the other "On the Indivisibility of Cooperation, Peace, and Freedom." The response to these declarations was very enthusiastic. On July 4, 1939, the International Cooperative Alliance issued a statement in the names of its President Tanner and Secretary-General May, which included this passage: "Cooperators of the world, abandon all the prejudices and biases that may weaken your actions, set aside your economic interests, and use your greatest efforts to achieve the unity of all mankind in the pursuit of the final victory of justice!" Unfortunately, this call was still useless, and the Second World War ultimately broke out in September of that year. This historical fact shows that although the power of the cooperative movement was not large enough to prevent or eliminate war, it demonstrated a spirit of courage and perseverance, as well as a passion for the pursuit of truth.

This year marks the 25th International Cooperative Day, and the world is still chaotic. With both anxiety and hope, we face reality and cherish ideals, and we cannot help but shout out the slogan "Cooperation or Destruction" to warn the world and encourage ourselves.

President Roosevelt of the United States wrote a letter to American cooperators in January 1944, in which he said: "I deeply anticipate the contribution that cooperatives around the world will make in the peaceful years that are soon to come." Yes, we cooperators must not belittle ourselves, because only we are the supporters and practitioners of the "cooperation or destruction" law. (July, 1947)

The Evolution of Cooperative Economics by Chen Zhongming

Cooperative economics is a democratic economic movement that grows out of the contradictions of capitalist economics. It arises against the backdrop of capitalist society and develops alongside the development of capitalist economics. After the development of capitalist economics, in the process of pursuing profits, the increasing concentration of capital leads to a more widespread separation of the means of production from the producers. As a result, the survival rights of the general public are increasingly controlled by a minority. Cooperative economics emerges as a form of resistance to this phenomenon: credit cooperatives (or cooperative finance) resist centralized financial capital, utilization cooperatives reclaim centralized means of production, and consumer (supply) cooperatives and marketing cooperatives (or cooperative marketing) prevent the monopolization of commercial capital. In the various stages of capitalist economic development, the forms of capital control differ, and correspondingly, the mainstream of cooperative economics also differs. Generally speaking, consumer cooperation corresponds to commercial capital, labor cooperation corresponds to industrial capital, credit cooperation (or cooperative finance) corresponds to financial capital, and in the current stage of imperialism, the dominant form of cooperative economics is agricultural cooperation.

The key difference between cooperative economics and capitalist economics is that the former aims to promote mutual benefit, while the latter aims to pursue profit. The former is self-help, mutual aid, coexistence, and co-prosperity, while the latter is free competition and profit monopolization. Therefore, although cooperative economics is nurtured by capitalism, it is inevitably a negation of capitalist economics.

As mentioned above, cooperative economics is a byproduct of capitalist economic development. Therefore, from the perspective of its origin, it has a natural mission to oppose capitalist economics. England was the first country to develop capitalism, so cooperative economics also took root in England. In the early 19th century, after the development of capitalism in England, the most serious social problem was the labor problem. In other words, the difficulty of workers' lives and the opposition between the labor and capital classes were the center of all social problems at that time. Therefore, various forms of socialism aimed to solve this problem, and cooperative economics emerged as a consumer cooperative enterprise form aimed at solving the living problems of the working class.

Later, this democratic economic movement crossed the English Channel and spread to continental Europe, first developing in France. The industrial revolution in France lagged behind England by twenty or thirty years, and the economic situation at that time was quite different from that of England. The most serious social problem caused by the development of capitalism in France was not the poverty of workers, but rather the misery of independent small producers, especially urban handicraftsmen, who were oppressed and ruined by mechanical industries. Therefore, the cooperative economic enterprises in France changed slightly, with industrial cooperation aimed at rescuing urban small producers dominating.

When cooperative economics spread to Germany, it appeared in another new enterprise form. Germany's industrial revolution lagged behind France by thirty or forty years. In order to compete with advanced capitalist countries, late-developing capitalist countries often sacrificed agriculture to subsidize the development of industry. Moreover, Germany was a country of small farmers, and it was particularly difficult for small-scale agriculture to adapt to capitalism. Therefore, after the development of capitalism in Germany, the most serious problem was the collapse of the rural economy and the poverty of farmers. As a result, cooperative economic enterprises also targeted rural areas and farmers, thus giving rise to agricultural cooperation.

Accordingly, if we abstractly explore the development path of cooperative economics, we can say that it starts from consumer cooperatives in England, goes through industrial cooperation in France, transitions through urban and rural credit cooperatives, and finally returns to agricultural cooperation in Germany.

In this transformation process, initially it targeted the working class, then the petty bourgeoisie, and finally the general public of farmers as its social foundation for development. Therefore, cooperative economics is actually a variable historical term. Although its meaning has not changed significantly in form from the past to the present, such as the democratic principle of one person, one vote, and the special dividend system, in essence, it has undergone significant evolution. The social significance of consumer cooperation is almost completely different from that of agricultural cooperation. This is a key point that we must grasp when studying cooperative economics. It is empty and without substance to only understand the form of cooperative economics. We must grasp the essence of cooperative economics in historical transformation. If we ignore the social foundation of cooperative economics and seek a meaning that is universally applicable to the past, present, and future, it is impossible to obtain it. In the past, some scholars grasped one aspect of the history of cooperative economic development and treated it as the whole picture, treating the principles of cooperative economics as a timeless and unchanging law that was not developed in real society but was deduced from Plato's ideal world and could be promoted to any corner of the world for thousands of years to come, so that the efficacy of cooperative economics was either exaggerated beyond the limits of appropriateness or constrained beyond the limits of need. For example, Charles Gide, the modern master of cooperative economics in France, only saw consumer cooperation and ignored industrial cooperation, and their theory could not explain agricultural cooperation based on farmers. Lassalle gave a reasonable explanation of industrial cooperation, but he also did not pay attention to agricultural cooperation. The above only abstractly points out the main process of transformation of cooperative economics. Of course, consumer cooperation is not limited to the working class, and industrial cooperation is not limited to France. That is only to point out its main or essential part.

The above is the conclusion drawn from the vertical development of cooperative economics. If we briefly examine its horizontal distribution, it is very obvious that although cooperative economics exists and develops in both capitalist metropolises and their colonies, there are extreme differences in the essence of cooperative economics. Even in the same metropole, there are some differences between advanced capitalist countries and backward capitalist countries. Generally speaking, consumer cooperative enterprises are more developed in advanced capitalist countries, while producer cooperative enterprises, especially agricultural cooperation, are more developed in backward capitalist countries. Although it is similar to backward capitalist countries in colonial and semi-colonial countries, with agricultural cooperation as the center, the latter is mostly spontaneous and exists as a social movement, while the former is often guided and exists as a social policy.

Although cooperative economics was initially a product of capitalist countries, as capitalism expands outward and domestic exploitation expands to internationalization, the problems caused by capitalism internally also appear in colonies in new forms. Therefore, although the content or essence of cooperative economics in colonies and metropolises is different, its origin—that it is an opposing thing produced by capitalist economics—is consistent. It must be added here that the cooperative economy in socialist countries, such as the cooperative organization in the Soviet Union, its origin and the historical tasks it undertakes are very different from the cooperative economy in capitalist countries (metropolises and colonies).

Secondly, in the early stages of cooperative economic development, especially in the cooperative program of the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society, the world's first successful cooperative, the principle of political neutrality of cooperative economics was clearly declared. This principle has long been followed by cooperative entrepreneurs in various countries, but we have seen in the history of cooperative economic development in various countries that not only has the Cooperative Party been established in England, the birthplace of the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society, demonstrating that its cooperative economy has become extremely active in the political field, but since World War I, as a result of the development of agricultural cooperation, cooperative economic enterprises have gradually established close relationships with the government. Especially during World War II, consumer cooperation in some countries has become an agency for government rationing of materials. In the current stage of surging democratic movements, this democratic economy is putting on a new guise of political struggle along with the development of democratic politics. Although there is still a reflection of the pre-era objective environment in the theory of cooperative economics, in the practical process, the politically transcendent position of cooperative economics is no longer possible to maintain. Just as the era of free economic competition has been replaced by the monopoly of imperialism, liberalism has become a historical relic, and the political neutrality of cooperative economics is only a recollection of the past.

The Yellow River is About to Show Its Hand!
A Dispatch from Zhengzhou, by our reporter Fan Shiqin

The Yellow River's flood and the dike restoration project! This project includes whether or not the government and the CCP will cooperate! It is about to be decided. The time remaining before this decision is made is only a short two weeks. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has sounded the alarm regarding this imminent dangerous situation: it says that if the two sides do not cease military actions in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, not only will millions of farmers in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei provinces suffer greatly, but the portions of the dike restoration work that have already been completed will also be completely destroyed. The matter is indeed this serious, because this flood, after the breaching of the Huayuankou dike, is the first time that the river is rushing towards its old dikes downstream, which have been neglected and collapsing for eight years. Any breach at any point could inundate millions of lives and countless acres of fertile land.

A Weak Link

Zhao Kou, fifty li downstream from Huayuankou, experienced a breach during the War of Resistance, and is still a weak link. It will of course be very easily breached first by the flood. Consequently, that section of the Longhai Railway will be flattened, and Kaifeng will be under threat. The situation is the same at Heigangbian, twenty-five li north of Kaifeng. Further on, at Dongbatou northwest of Lanfeng, which is where a breach occurred in the fifth year of Xianfeng of the former Qing dynasty, this severely damaged old scar is also a major target that the flood wishes to find an opening and attack. If it does, it will be able to relive its old dream of galloping through northern Jiangsu and flooding the Central Plains. (The elders of Jiangsu must remember clearly that they once raised funds to build a dike in that area.) According to a recent report from UNRRA advisor Todd after inspecting the situation along the downstream banks, the section between Linpuji and ShiliPu east of Changyuan is the most severely damaged, and a breach there could cause flooding to the north and south. Regardless of whether it is in government-controlled areas or CCP-controlled areas, all will be devoured by the flood. Also, the area around Jiyang is full of dangers, and it must be fully repaired before it can withstand the onslaught of the flood.

Worries About Two Regions

The examples listed above are the most serious and the most dangerous. There are also two regions that cannot help but cause concern: one is the triangular area near the river mouth. It is said that the dikes had already collapsed before the War of Resistance. Even if the dikes are to be restored this time, UNRRA is unable to provide assistance due to the principle of being limited to restoring the parts damaged during the war. This is something that we must complete ourselves. The other is the Qin River area upstream of Huayuankou. The Qin River is connected to the Yellow River, and the Yellow River's floodwaters can flow back into it. Currently, the north bank of that river is under the control of the Communist army. The Dafan and Laolongwan areas in Wu Zhi County within it were breached by the enemy during the War of Resistance, and were later repaired hastily by the local people. The Qiaoqiao and Wuchekou areas on the south bank (also in Wu Zhi County) were also breached during the war, although they have also been blocked. However, these two places are now only one meter above the water surface, and the dangerous situation is also unimaginable. Although there are no Communist troops in those two places, Qiujie, less than ten or twenty li to the west, is in the hands of the Communist army, and they can disrupt your construction at any time. If the Yellow River flood comes, Mulandian to the east of Wuzhi will have problems, and the several counties of northern Henan will inevitably be submerged.

Dangerous Works Along the North and South Banks

To talk about the dangerous works along the Yellow River bank, it would take three days and three nights to talk it all out, because the Yellow River has breached its dikes more than a thousand times in history. Just from the former Qing Dynasty onwards, the places where the dikes breached from Guangwu to Kaifeng were: on the north bank, Lizhuang (9th year of Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty), Modian (60th year of Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty), Jiaoying (14th year of Jiaqing of the Qing Dynasty and 60th year of Kangxi), and near Qibao (15th year of Shunzhi of the Qing Dynasty and 16th year of Qianlong); on the south bank: Heyuantou (7th year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty), near Yangqiao (1st year of Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty and 26th year of Qianlong), Wan (1st year of Kangxi), near the east of Wannanyitou (6th year of Yongzheng), Xinzai (23rd year of Daoguang), Heigangkou (5th year of Xianfeng), and south of Yangzhuang (21st year of Daoguang).

Liu Bocheng Using the River to Kill

Time flies, we must not delay. According to the initial decision of the Yellow River Dike Restoration Joint Committee, the dike restoration project must be completed before July 15. There are only two weeks left until now. This committee includes two representatives from the CCP. Although time is pressing, it should still proceed smoothly. However, in recent days, Liu Bocheng's five columns have suddenly moved from northern Henan to the Yellow River bank in the area south of Xinxiang County, which has cast a dark cloud over the hearts of those concerned about the Yellow River dike restoration. If Liu Bocheng really uses the Yellow River's water to kill people, everyone must punish him to appease the Yellow River.

There was no major drought upstream of the Yellow River last year, and there has been no torrential rain this spring. Currently, the Yellow River's water level only has a flow of 2,000 cubic meters per second (a major flood can reach 15,000 or 16,000), which are all things that allow one to feel slightly relieved. However, experts all believe that these dilapidated old dikes downstream are like a veteran soldier who has been discharged for a long time, without the ability to resist the elite troops of the flood. Now, the only hope is to injure limbs and not harm the heart and lungs.

Essays
Remembering S. by Fengjia

I accidentally learned from an article in a certain newspaper that S. had died somewhere. According to the author, this is just a rumor, but he has no information to prove that the rumor is unfounded. "S. is not dead." That's how I hope it is in my worldview, but "human affairs are vague, although I can guess," I know that this is just a comforting thought. If S. were to unfortunately die, although he would be getting what he wanted, his friends would inevitably feel endless sorrow.

I first met S. in the late spring of 1937.

One slightly depressing noon, my classmate Z. and I left school, preparing to take a train to the Shanghai concession, a journey that would take less than 20 minutes. As we boarded the train car, Z. noticed two acquaintances there and went over to chat with them, then introduced them to us. One of them was gentle and refined, wearing glasses and a brown suit, looking about 23 or 24 years old. That was A. M. The other was about the same age, wearing a long robe, a worn French hat, and carrying a walking stick. His lips were thick and slightly upturned, and his face showed a stubborn expression. That was S. At that time, the literary world was advocating national defense literature, and the poets in Shanghai were brewing the organization of a national poetry group, so we chatted about this topic for a while. After the train arrived in Shanghai, we parted ways.

Later, I learned that both S. and A. M. were alumni of our school, so when we first met them in a teahouse, it unconsciously eliminated a lot of restraint. During this period, I met A. M. more often. S. stayed in Shanghai for a very short time before returning to Wuhan to resume his civil servant career.

In the winter of 1938, S. returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong (he had retreated to Hong Kong when Wuhan fell). At this time, this so-called "isolated island" of Shanghai was "licentious and shameless on the one hand, and serious work on the other," but most liberal intellectuals lacked the courage and determination to confront reality. To go with the flow would be against their conscience, so they could only make a living in contradiction and distress. Some of our friends were more or less of this kind. But S.'s return added some vitality to everyone.

S. was a good conversationalist. When we were together, he was almost always the only one talking. While smoking, he would talk eloquently in his low, nasal voice about what he had seen and heard in the rear, and when he got excited, he would often burst out laughing himself.

Not long after S. returned to Shanghai, he became one of the active figures in the literary world. He was simultaneously editing two literary magazines, constantly writing articles, and attending some group lectures or giving guidance. After his efforts, the Shanghai Poetry Workers Association was established in the summer of 1939. It published the journal "Row" and printed a batch of palm-sized books, making a considerable contribution to the poetry movement in Shanghai.

Although not entirely, it was partly due to overwork that S.'s originally weak body became increasingly worse. He coughed up blood several times, and his face always looked pale. He was not willing to rest; drinking, smoking, sitting in cafes late at night, sometimes not sleeping all night.

I remember once at V.'s house. It was a late spring night, the room was heated, everyone had finished talking, but no one wanted to leave, sitting motionless and silent, perhaps everyone was contemplating something, chewing on something. Gradually, the candles on the table turned to ashes, the red fire also turned dim, until it went out. A loud bugle call came from the nearby British barracks. Dawn rose, and we felt a wave of fatigue and went to sleep on the floor in V.'s house, wrapped in quilts.

We often lived this kind of life, which undoubtedly had a very bad effect on S.'s health. Some of us tried to persuade him to stop, but he didn't take it to heart. When he coughed up blood, he would be careful for a few days, but after that, everything would be back to normal.

In the early winter of 1939, I left Shanghai. After that, I never saw S. again, and we never exchanged letters. Only in the summer of 1940, from P., who had just come to the interior from Shanghai, did I learn a little about his recent situation: his health was still very bad, but he was working even harder in literary activities.

In the autumn of 1942, Mr. and Mrs. HY wrote from Suzhou, mentioning that S. was immersed in writing "The Biography of Jesus" in the low pressure of the "isolated island." At that time, I imagined that his state of mind must be very lonely, but loneliness might be a good exercise for him!

Later, I learned from the newspaper that he had gone to a certain place in Jiangnan. And I also read some of his writings filled with fighting will. Soon FV also went there. In order to go to Rome, these friends who had always had very few things in common in their thinking but were close as brothers finally embarked on the same road.

However, the bad news came that S. had been sacrificed. Was S. really sacrificed? Looking east at the clouds and mountains, my grief is boundless! On this day when his death has not been fully confirmed, I wish him good health! (Sent from Chengdu, June 26)

Ruth and Naomi by Kerderming

A poem about Ruth set in a Hebrew village is familiar to people in Europe and America. Scholars have not yet found out who wrote the poem and who the characters are. One passage in the poem is roughly: "Let me not leave you, and do not turn back as I follow you: for where you go, I will go; where you lodge, I will lodge; your friends will be my friends; your God will be my God." This passage can fully illustrate this painting. Kerderming's name first appeared on the list of the Academy of Arts in 1853. His ancestors were Spanish. He was born in Botes in 1833. He enrolled in London in his youth. In 1850, he studied at the Leys School and later entered the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He joined the Royal Academy of Arts in 1867 and passed away in 1898.

Lights by Huang Yun

Travelers love lights.

In the darkness, how much they yearn for lights.

When I was young, I used to listen to my grandmother telling stories about travelers and lights with her dry lips. A light in the darkness will guide travelers out of the maze.

I also remembered seeing the lighthouse far away in the sea on a ship, which was a guidepost for the route.

So lights gave me a deep impression. I saw the little moths flying around the green lamp, they loved the light so much, even though they died in the light.

I also have infinite love for the street lights. Whenever I walk on the night road, I silently count the dim yellow street lights, letting the faint light shine on my steps, guiding me all the way to my destination.

I often think this way: humans are travelers in this world, but the lights in the darkness are so stingy to emit light.

In this dark journey, there are many hearts that pray for the light of lights; a light burning in human hearts.

Some people say that the world is too dark, probably because there are no lights.

Inscription on Ma Gongyu's Painting of Riding a Tiger by Zhang Daqian

Huang Gong of the East Sea exhausted his incantations, but my brother is particularly skilled in this art. I envy you for being a sculptor as well, once calling out to Xiao Kong in Hualin. The immortal riding the tiger has gone and not returned, and old friends weep (when my late brother Shanzhi passed away, you had a long poem lamenting him); for ten years I have dreamed of the road to Wumen, leaving the essence of gold for the world to see.

The French Writers Association by P. Taija, translated by Xu Zhongnian

According to the association's charter, the long-established French Writers Association (Société des Gens de Lettres) is about to convene a general meeting of its members to re-elect some of the directors and discuss the modernization of the writing profession. I once told my colleagues in the association that in this day and age, the tragedy of Chatterton (translator's note: an 18th-century English poet) committing suicide in poverty would not occur, because if he were alive today, he could have insurance.

From 1939 to 1945, the association's organization underwent many changes, and its main purpose was to protect the spiritual and material rights and interests of its members. Its business is expanding day by day. In 1944, when France was liberated, the association was able to attract the attention of the authorities even more, because its members were able to promote culture and support major causes for the country. From October 1944 to February 1946, Mr. Zhao Ru Le Gongtuo resumed his post as chairman, which made the Masha Mansion—the association's headquarters—restore its former appearance, forgetting the nightmares of the fallen era. From February 1946 to March 1947, Madame Jia Mi'er Jiapu succeeded him as chairman, who was intelligent and capable and made many achievements, making the association's own cause cooperate with the national construction plan, effectively safeguarding the dignity of writers and the freedom of writing.

Thanks to Mr. Le Gongtuo's idealism and Madame Jiapu's realism, the association's mission can be further expanded, and the directors are more willing to work hard. Gérard Bauer is the most popular candidate to succeed Madame Jiapu as chairman and can be called the support of the entire body of members.

In the French literary world, the position of chairman of the Writers Association is very lofty, like a "marshal" in the military. We only need to look at who has been the chairman since its establishment (1838) to understand its importance: initially there were: Villemain (translator's note: critic), Balzac (major novelist), Hugo (the greatest poet of the Romantic School), François Arago (great scientist), Vigny (poet), etc.; closer to us there are: Marcel Prevost (novelist), Paul Hervieu (playwright), Victor Margueritte (novelist), René Doumic (lifetime secretary of the Académie Française), Pierre de Courcel (critic), Edmond Haraucourt (poet), Charles Le Goffic (novelist), Édouard Estaunié (novelist), Pierre Benoit (novelist), Gaston Deschamps (critic), François Mauriac (novelist), Zhao Ru Guamel (novelist),... almost the entire Académie Française has moved in. Because, for a long time, being the chairman of the Writers Association has been the prelude to being elected as a member of the Académie Française—although the chairman himself has no intention of this.

After this list of famous figures, Mr. Gérard Bauer's name will undoubtedly be added.

When talking about one's friends, it is best to cite a famous precedent. In his "Memoirs of a Recluse," Lucien Taijafu (translator's note: he is the father of the author of this article, Pierre Taijafu) has a very vivid chapter describing Henri Poedo: "A great journalist, never a lackey of anyone," and said: "In the newspaper, he (Henri) fought frankly," "He promoted the younger generation, protected wronged celebrities, and made them hope to rekindle and regain vitality." If the older generation respects and loves each other so much, readers probably will not blame Lucien Gu Jiafu's son for praising Henri Podo's son, saying that he is: the most wonderful representative of French wisdom, especially the ever-changing Parisian spirit. Having been influenced by the master Clemenceau (translator's note: that is, "Tiger Prime Minister," a famous journalist), Mr. Gérard Bauer is a famous journalist, ethicist, and essayist. He once said: "Wasting my time to observe everything: this is my hobby, and probably what I do best." That's right, his time is wasted, but it saves our time, and he faithfully records our time.

Memory by Jiang Ye

Time takes away people's youth; but it cannot take away people's memories. "A person's heart suffers an injury, and it will always hurt." People's memories are all bitter. My youth was not beautiful at all. A wandering life of destitution occupied most of my youth. I wandered, I was poor, I was sick, I lived like a stray dog.

But I cherish my memories. Because even in the most difficult times, I never succumbed to life. I didn't crawl over like a lower animal. I stood up, fell down; when I fell down, I stood up again. In the days of suffering, I struggled one step at a time. When a beautiful dream encounters harsh reality and is shattered, I will sit down silently alone, or take a walk outdoors, reviewing the bitterness of my memories. Immersed in bitter memories, my heart suddenly becomes young again.

One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood 334 by Ye Jingfeng

This is about to turn back to the item of a spy's stereotyped appearance. On the headquarters' registered dossier file, there must be a footnote, and there must be a name; this name must designate a stereotyped substitute name; however, the words explaining this name and footnote are not very short. If it is too short, it is easy to cause ambiguity, and if it is not short, it cannot meet the condition of "affirmative clarity" in secret instructions.

He Jian can be said to be an expert in this work. In addition to learning, he also has many years of experience, so he classified and summarized the stereotyped appearance into fifteen departments; the first to eighth types are for general social appearances, and the ninth to fifteenth types are for military appearances; the numbers are also determined, what the first number is, what social type it should be, what password, what route, what posture, what action. Therefore, in secret instructions, only the number needs to be specified. The person in charge who receives the order, regardless of whether he has seen this person before, can find it with a single search, without any errors. All reports and records can also be simplified, which is extremely convenient.

This time when I went to Tianjin to work and sing this big show, I used the "Fifteenth" stereotype, that is, my pseudonym "professional" - the comrade of the senior secretary and external affairs officer of the Military Intelligence Special Department came to me, and according to this route, with a password, I could find me.

(According to the method stipulated by He Jian on that day, there were also comprehensive numbers and organic changes, which will not be explained here because they are not important to the text).

That night, after using the "Fifteenth" posture to

### Sugar Prices Slightly Soft

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly soft, with occasional slight declines. The guild made adjustments, but Peruvian sugar saw the largest drop, initially at $665,000, then $645,000, a decrease of about $20,000. Second-grade medium white sugar fell from $610,000 to $600,000, a small decrease of $10,000. Taiwanese red sugar fell from $570,000 to $565,000. Second-fourth grade coarse white sugar was at $685,000 to $690,000. Fourth-grade half-refined white sugar initially went from $630,000 to $638,000, then to $620,000, a small decrease of $20,000.

Xinghua white sugar was particularly high, at $590,000, then $570,000. Xinghua red sugar was at $470,000 to $450,000, with several hundred baskets traded, showing a slight recovery. Diaozhou green sugar was at $380,000, and ordinary sugar was at $376,000, with slightly under 300 bags traded.

### Active Export of Green Tea – Wenzhou Hasting to Quote Prices

Among export green teas, categories like "Chou Zhen" and "Zhen Mei" have historically found their largest market in French Africa. Yesterday, the market trend suddenly became active, the reason being the resurgence of rumors regarding the opening of trade there. Furthermore, local tea exporters are considering moving their inventories of old tea from 1946, leading to growing optimism. Holders are asking for higher prices than before, resulting in a noticeable rise in prices. Other varieties remain unasked for. However, new Wenzhou black tea of this year, after active negotiations, has been quoted for sale, with top-grade tea reportedly at $900,000 per dan (a unit of weight), and mid-grade tea at $720,000 per dan, which are considered stable prices. As for domestic sales of red and green tea, due to the approaching peak season, demand is improving, and prices are very strong.

### American and British Cigarettes Firm

Yesterday's cigarette market saw mixed attitudes from various parties, with moderate trading volume. Huacheng Company released 10,000 packs of "Golden Rat" cigarettes, starting at $220 per pack, using 350 "cards" (likely referring to a distribution system), with 125 "A cards" and 50 "C cards" utilized. Furthermore, the Da Zhonghua Tobacco Company released "Horseshoe" brand cigarettes at $30,000 per pack, with each reseller receiving 25 packs, tightening the cash flow among dealers and leading to slow trading.

Throughout the day, American and British cigarettes saw more active trading. Ten-packs of British American Tobacco cigarettes rose by $70,000 compared to the previous day, reaching $7,430,000. "Old Gold" cigarettes also rose by $30,000, reaching $6,430,000. "555" cigarettes also showed a slight increase. Among Chinese cigarettes, "Beautiful Golden Rat," "Great Kles," "Golden Dragon," and high-grade "Great South Gate," and "San Pao Tai" cigarettes showed weakness. Other brands like "Bank," "Red Man," and "Crusader" cigarettes rebounded by $100 to $2,000. American brands like "Lucky Strike," "Camel," and "Marlboro" remained stable due to limited supply. [Another Report] Many 50-cigarette tins recently returned to the market as gift returns from the Dragon Boat Festival. Stores have taken in many, causing inventory to swell and demand to soften, putting downward pressure on the market. "Gallico" cigarettes were last priced at $56,500 per tin, down $1,500. "3-5" brand cigarettes also fell by $2,000, to $48,000. Other white tin-packaged cigarettes such as "Little San Pao," and "Sailor" brands all fell by $500 to $800.

### Tight Money Supply in the Market - Significant Deficits for National Banks

[Our Report] After the settlement of the six bottom banks, the money supply in the market has not eased. In the clearing house, on the 3rd, national banks had a total deficit of 15.3 billion yuan, foreign banks had a deficit of 25.4 billion yuan, directly exchanging commercial banks had a deficit of 4.11 billion yuan, while agent exchanging banks after number 50 had a total surplus of 44.8 billion yuan. Yesterday, national banks had a deficit of 40 billion yuan, foreign banks had a deficit of 6.6 billion yuan, directly exchanging commercial banks had a surplus of 5.4 billion yuan, and banks after number 50 had a surplus of 41.2 billion yuan. It is said that loans from commercial banks to national banks and foreign banks must be repaid due to the authorities' account checks, resulting in large deficits in recent days. In addition, the payment of funds from the public subscription of US dollar bonds, various taxes, and the sale of yarn and cloth from the textile industry are the main reasons for the large deficits of national banks. Therefore, in the past two days, smaller banks and outside the industry circles have felt the tightness of funds, and shadow interest rates have hovered between 21% and 25%.

### Solution to Fuel Oil Supply Problem for Shipping Industry

The local shipping industry previously faced a shortage of fuel oil due to the limited import quotas and the sharp increase in demand, which affected water transportation. The industry association sent representatives to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation, calling for relief and increased quotas. Subsequently, China Petroleum Corporation, together with local American-Asia Petroleum and Texas Petroleum companies, discussed a unified supply plan, jointly published notices, and asked all shipping companies and factories powered by oil engines to register their oil demand with the company's Shanghai office before May 17. It is now known that the survey of fuel oil needs for the shipping industry has been completed. A total of 34 shipping companies, including Minsheng Company, have registered in the city, with 51 vessels, including Tianlong, requiring a total of 17,444 tons of fuel oil per month. The oil companies will allocate the supply according to the import quota ratio and supply capacity. Asia Petroleum will supply 6,825 tons, Mobil 5,181 tons, Texaco 2,729 tons, and China Petroleum Corporation 2,709 tons, and sales have already begun. Therefore, the fuel oil supply problem for ships has been temporarily and reasonably resolved.

### New Batch of Banknotes Arrives in Shanghai from England

[Our Report] The British shipping company's (Trevetboe) arrived in China from London the night before last at about 9 o'clock and is now berthed at its pier in Pudong. In addition to more than 2,000 pieces of commercial goods, there are 640 boxes of new banknotes, estimated at £41,256. The new banknotes have not yet been signed. Yesterday, Yuanhe Customs Brokerage handled the import and extraction procedures.

The Jardine Matheson-represented Ewo Tai Company's Green Chen Lan left Shanghai yesterday for Europe, loaded with 1,200 tons of refrigerated fresh eggs and 120 tons of tung oil for Marseille. In addition, the Fula Company's China Immelie also went to Little Luzon yesterday, also loaded with 1,300 boxes of refrigerated fresh eggs, 30 boxes of fresh yellow croaker, and over 600 pieces of onions, potatoes, garlic, and preserved eggs.

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haichen ship sailed its maiden voyage to the South Pacific Indian route yesterday, carrying 3,000 bags of goods to Calcutta, 200 pieces of cotton yarn to Rangoon, and about 2,000 pieces of general merchandise to Singapore, Hong Kong, and other ports.
