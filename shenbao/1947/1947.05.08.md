[Associated Press, Nanjing, 7th] The National Government Committee also discussed the price issue, unanimously agreeing to lift the freeze on the cost of living index from January and instructed relevant departments to draft new economic measures.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan presented a report on the principles of the government's stabilization of the national economy at the second session of the State Affairs meeting on the 7th. He reviewed the emergency economic measures plan, believing that certain points should be strengthened and certain points should be revised.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun reported on finance at the State Affairs meeting on the morning of the 7th. Mr. Yu stated: The central task of the Ministry of Finance at present is how to bring budget revenues and expenditures closer to balance. Therefore, all financial measures aim to increase revenue. In terms of policy implementation, one is to strengthen the tax system, one is to cooperate with economic policies to promote production development; one is to regulate finance to seek currency stability; and one is to control the budget to reduce unnecessary expenditures. At the same time, it will further utilize public debt material policies to absorb social idle funds and utilize international surplus economic power and enemy property sales prices to supplement revenue. Subsequently, he made a brief review of the implementation of the national general budget for this year. The original budget listed revenue at more than 730 billion yuan and expenditure at more than 930 billion yuan, but because since the beginning of the year, peaceful unification has not been realized, transportation has been obstructed, and production has stagnated, the economic undertakings on which finance relies have been greatly affected, and it is even more difficult for the national treasury's revenue and expenditure to adapt. From January to April, it was the off-season for tax collection, and the reports from various provinces have not yet arrived. According to the numbers from the treasury, its revenue is approximately more than 200 billion yuan, while expenditure is approximately more than 500 billion yuan. It is estimated that more than 1.2 trillion yuan will still need to be spent in the eight months from May to the end of the year, and the total amount spent will be approximately 1.8 trillion yuan. If we generously add a reserve fund of 200 billion yuan, the total expenditure will be 2 trillion yuan.

The National Treasury Has Large Amounts of Gold and Foreign Exchange

In terms of revenue, in addition to the reorganization of tax revenues, revenue can exceed the total budget by 300 billion yuan, totaling 1 trillion yuan. The US dollar bonds and treasury bills currently issued can yield 480 billion yuan, and the sale price of surplus materials and the acceptance of enemy and puppet property are expected to increase revenue by more than 200 billion yuan due to the revised foreign exchange rate. Therefore, it is hoped that revenue can reach 1.7 trillion yuan, and the deficit is being addressed by seeking sound financial resources for compensation. Mr. Yu further pointed out that recently, the outside world has been speculating wildly about the number of issuances. In fact, as of the end of April, there were only more than 600 billion yuan. The national treasury has large amounts of foreign exchange and gold, so preparations are exceptionally sufficient.

### Office Expenses for Various Agencies: Approved Increase Ratios; Subsidies for Twelve Provinces and Cities Total Over One Hundred Billion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The approved increase ratios for office expenses of various agencies are as follows: (1) Regular expenses will be increased by two to two and a half times the original amount.

All prepaid funds will be integrated into the additional budgets of various agencies, and business agencies should allocate them within the originally approved business changes. (3) Special office expenses for civil servants will be increased by three times, calculated as 300,000 yuan for the presidents of the Five Yuans, 270,000 yuan for the vice presidents, members of the government committee, chief secretaries, provincial chairmen, and political committee members, and 240,000 yuan for legislative and supervisory members. Furthermore, the total amount of subsidies for public utilities and coal is more than 361 billion yuan, of which the Shanghai municipality's share for May is 6,687,583,000 yuan. Furthermore, the total budget for the 36th year of the Republic for Hebei, Fujian, Gansu, Guizhou, Kangding, Shaanxi, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Beijing, Qingdao, and Chongqing, totaling twelve provinces and cities, has a total estimated revenue of more than 126.4 billion yuan and a total expenditure of more than 219.9 billion yuan, with government subsidies exceeding 13.4 billion yuan.

Currently, the two sides are in a stalemate in the area west of Lujiazhuang. The National Army in Southern Shanxi is still firmly defending the four strongholds of Xia County, Anyi, Yuncheng, and the airport. More than 20 packages of supplies were airdropped to Yuncheng on the 6th. A certain unit of the National Army crossed east to Southern Shanxi.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 6th] According to Zhao Chengshou, who returned from the Zhengtai front, the communist army concentrated four columns and twelve brigades, commanded by Nie Rongzhen and Xiao Ke, as commander and deputy commander respectively, attempting to directly approach Taiyuan. However, due to the National Army's heroic resistance, the communist army suffered 20,000 casualties, and the offensive was temporarily thwarted. Currently, the communist army is concentrating on reorganizing Pinging and Shouyang. In terms of the consumption of the communist army's manpower and resources, we have been successful. In terms of destruction, the communist army has achieved its goals.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] It is now confirmed that Yuncheng, Southern Shanxi, is still firmly defended by the National Army. The battles on the outskirts of the city are fierce.

Furthermore, the battles in Anyi and Yuncheng have gradually subsided since the 6th due to the heavy casualties suffered by the communist troops in repeated attacks.

### Departure of the Lüda Inspection Group Imminent; Stationing of Military Police Still Pending Decision; Soviet Union Offers Alternative Interpretation of Sino-Soviet Treaty

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The issue of receiving Lüda (Dalian and Lüshun) has been largely resolved, with only one point remaining unapproved by the Soviet side. This is the issue of our military police entering Lüda simultaneously with the receiving personnel. Foreign Vice Minister Ye Gongchao emphasized this point when answering reporters' questions at a press conference held at 4:00 PM on the 7th. Ye stated that the Soviet Ambassador's response, submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, should not be made public according to usual diplomatic practice before the negotiations are completed. However, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Soviet side on April 17th, outlining the procedures we intended to take for receiving Lüda and how to proceed with the reception, as well as matters related to the joint management of the China Changchun Railway in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The note also mentioned sending an inspection group to Lüda before the reception, which the Soviet side has agreed to. However, a mutually satisfactory method has not yet been reached regarding the simultaneous entry of our military police into Lüda. The inspection group will depart in the near future, and the members include Dong Yanping, Zhang Jianfei, and others. Regarding whether journalists can accompany the inspection group, Ye stated that the government welcomes journalists to accompany and report in principle, but no newspapers have yet submitted requests to the government. The government is considering whether they can accompany the inspection group. Furthermore, regarding the issue of our military police entering Lüda, the main point of contention lies in the interpretation of the clause in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance related to the stationing of troops in Lüda. The clause roughly states that the Soviet side considers the defense zone of the Lüshun naval base (including Dalian) during wartime should still be regarded as wartime until the Sino-Japanese peace treaty is concluded. Our side, however, believes that the war has long since ended, and the Japanese military threat no longer exists, so it cannot still be regarded as wartime. Based on the Soviet side's view, our troops not only cannot enter Lüshun and Dalian, but also cannot be stationed there.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 7th] Ye Gongchao stated at a press conference today that the Sino-French air transport agreement will expire on June 30th of this year, and the Chinese government is giving favorable consideration to the revisions and extensions proposed by France. (Note: The original Sino-French air agreement stipulated that aircraft from China and France would fly between Shanghai and Saigon once a week, starting from January 1st of this year, for a term of six months. New negotiations began after the Chinese government notified its termination of the agreement on March 31st.)

Answer: After regaining control of Tai'an at 11:30 AM yesterday, the National Army in southern Shandong has joined forces with the National Army in the Jinan area. The remnants of the Communist army are fleeing to the mountainous areas north and east of Tai'an. The situation of the Communist army in Shandong is very embarrassing because after losing the strongholds of Mount Tai and Mount Culai in southern Shandong, they can no longer gain a foothold in Shandong. Moreover, most of their troops are local militias and conscripts, who do not want to leave their hometowns, so they cannot all withdraw from Shandong, which puts them in a dilemma. The military situation in Shanxi is not as serious as reported by some newspapers. The main forces of both sides have not yet made contact. There are only about 10,000 Communist troops in northern Shanxi, and only 10,000 to 20,000 Communist troops on the Zhengtai Railway line.

### Chairman's Instructions on Fluctuations in Grain Prices; Strict Prohibition of Hoarding and Manipulation to Harm the People; Four Measures Stipulated for Provinces to Follow

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 7th] After the grain shortages occurred in various places, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the provincial chairman, instructing four measures to be followed immediately. The telegram stated: Grain is indispensable for the people's food, and there must be no hoarding, manipulation, or profiteering to harm the people. In recent times, grain prices in various places have fluctuated greatly, which is extremely harmful to people's livelihoods. Now, four measures are stipulated: (1) All legitimate grain merchants engaged in the purchase and sale of grain should be protected and facilitated by administrative authorities at all levels. Grain merchants who have not been registered and approved shall not hoard grain. (2) Loans and advances approved by banks shall also be limited to legitimate grain merchants who have been registered and approved. For amounts of 100 shi or more of grain, the Grain Department must be notified at any time. For amounts of 200 shi or more, approval must first be obtained from the Ministry of Food. No bank shall privately purchase or store grain. (3) Legitimate grain merchants shall sell and supply grain to the market at any time after purchasing and transporting it, and shall not hoard it or deliberately raise prices. (4) The circulation between rural and urban areas shall be absolutely free, and no local party, government, military organizations, or people's organizations shall obstruct it. If it is necessary to restrict the outflow of grain in cities where the government has designated price controls, the local grain administration authorities shall handle it according to the orders of the Ministry of Food, and no other agencies shall interfere beyond their authority.

[Another dispatch] The Hangzhou People's Food Purchase and Sales Committee and the People's Food Adjustment Committee jointly resolved: "Abolish negotiated prices and allow free buying and selling, but the grain industry and shop guilds must prepare a cost calculation table and submit it to the Price Review Committee for review." The proposed door-to-door selling price is 280,000 yuan per shi for white glutinous rice and 250,000 yuan per shi for steamed glutinous white rice, which has been submitted for approval, but the market still has no quotations.

[Another dispatch] Hangzhou agencies organized a rice shop investigation team after the disturbances. According to the investigation, 7,195 shi and 3 dou of tax grain were robbed, and 2,377 shi and 5 dou were sold at Kang prices to cope with the emergency situation. According to grain merchants, 136 grain shops in the city were destroyed, and 4,491 shi of rice were lost (urban area), so the city's losses were enormous.

### Wuxi Rice Shops Recalling Resuming Business; Suzhou Market Stops Free Trading

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 7th] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Kesu attached great importance to the rice rush that occurred in Wuxi, in addition to sending important officials to Wuxi to carefully handle it, he also telegraphed the post-disaster policy day and night. Now, the rice industry in Wuxi has returned to normal starting on the 7th. At the same time, the provincial government, based on the instructions from the central government, telegraphed the remaining counties to discuss and determine grain prices according to the market situation, encourage grain merchants to purchase from producing areas, transport them themselves, supply the retail market as much as possible, and strictly prevent grain shortages. The rumor that this province prohibits the transportation of rice to Shanghai is absolutely incorrect.

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 7th] Today, the rice industry sells rice to each person with a limit of one dou, priced at 180,000 yuan per shi, only one type of rice is available, in order to maintain the people's food supply. In the afternoon, the county chamber of commerce held an emergency meeting and decided: (1) Collect the total number of robberies from various street numbers, describe the process in detail, and submit it to the Executive Yuan, the provincial government, and the county government for relief. (2) Request the government to allocate the balance of the tax grain from Wuxi to alleviate the people's food shortage. (3) Request the provincial government to strengthen police forces, strengthen security, and ensure that such unfortunate incidents do not happen again. (4) Request the command to severely punish the rice robbery offenders. The provincial government also telegraphed the county to instruct and guide grain merchants to sell their grain reserves, maintain the people's food supply, not hoard and raise prices, and strive to reduce the burden on ordinary people. The chamber of commerce and the food industry should purchase from surplus grain areas in other provinces to increase reserves and pay close attention to avoiding rice shortages.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 7th] The Suzhou rice market stopped free trading on the 7th. The county government stipulated that each grain shop must sell 500 dan per day, and the price was set at 220,000 yuan. However, for other merchants to purchase, they must first obtain a purchase certificate from the grain association and then collect it from the designated rice shop, with a limit of five shi at a time. The rice merchants did not follow the above measures, so the market turnover was very low. Grain merchants are now preparing to request a higher negotiated price, but it is heard that the county government has reached an agreement with the Wujiang grain association to supply the needs of the Suzhou market, so people's hearts have improved.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 7th] Grain prices here continue to rise, and each dan has been sold for 180,000 yuan (an increase of 40,000 yuan). In order to curb the rising prices, in addition to prohibiting external transportation, it is also stipulated that grain merchants shall not transport grain.

### Hu Shi Discusses Prices and Living; "A Monthly Salary of Only 30-odd U.S. Dollars, It's Conceivable How to Maintain a Living"

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] Hu Shi talked freely with reporters today about the issue of prices and living. He said, "With prices rising so sharply, not to mention professors, even I, as the president of the university, have no way to deal with it." When the reporter asked how to overcome this difficulty, Mr. Hu said, "Friends in the bank know that I am poor, so they helped me. I value credit, so I will have to pay it back eventually." Speaking of the distance between salary and prices, he said, "When I came to Peking University, I earned 280,000 yuan per month, which was about 100 U.S. dollars. The second time it was adjusted to more than 500,000 yuan, which was still about 100 U.S. dollars. But recently, although I have increased it to more than one million, it only amounts to more than 30 U.S. dollars. I earn 1.2 U.S. dollars a day, which is only 30 or 40 cents an hour. It's conceivable how to maintain a living." He also jokingly said, "I might as well teach in the United States." The whole day Ting interjected from the side and said, "President Hu originally planned to teach in the United States and use the remaining money to subsidize teaching, but now it has already exceeded that amount." But when it comes to the issue of how to curb inflation, Mr. Hu still does not want to express his opinion.

### UNRRA Allocates 3 Billion Yuan to Relieve Housing Shortages in Zhejiang Province

[Our City News] UNRRA decided yesterday to allocate 3 billion yuan specifically for relieving housing shortages in Zhejiang Province. According to Branch Director Sun Xiaolou, Zhejiang Province suffered heavy casualties in housing during the war, especially in Xiaoli, Anji, Xiaoshan, Fuyang, Changyu, Wuyu, Haining, Haiyan, and Tonglu, etc. He has been repeatedly requested by local people in Zhejiang to come to Shanghai to appeal to the headquarters, requesting a special fund to build people's houses in order to relieve tens of thousands of people who have nowhere to live. A considerable result has now been obtained. It is estimated that the construction cost of a people's house is about 300,000 yuan, and the total allocation of 3 billion yuan from the headquarters can build about 10,000 houses. As for the regional allocation of people's housing construction, it will be submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Post-War Relief and Review Committee for decision after returning to Zhejiang tomorrow. Sun also said that UNRRA has also decided to establish an agricultural machinery manufacturing factory in Zhejiang Province (the above-mentioned factories have been established in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Shenyang, and Liuzhou). UNRRA will allocate 160 tons of machines and tools, worth about 2 billion yuan, and 300 tons of raw materials, worth about 1 billion yuan. In addition, 1 billion yuan will be invested by four banks and two bureaus, and 1 billion yuan will be invested by local gentry, with a total capital of 5 billion yuan, in order to improve existing agricultural machinery and increase production.

### Shandong Actively Repairs Yellow River Embankment; Mobilizing 1 Million Laborers; Decided to Proceed in Two Phases; Officially Commencing Work the Day After Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th] The Yellow River embankment reconstruction project in Shandong Province will mobilize 1 million laborers and require 2 million cubic meters of earth. The Shandong Embankment Repair Office decided to proceed in two phases before the flood season, officially commencing work on the 10th and completing it before July 15th. Kong Lingrong, director of the office, held a meeting with county chiefs of counties near Heze in Heze on the 6th to discuss issues such as hiring laborers and purchasing materials. It is heard that the difficult areas for construction are currently in the 80-kilometer section from Juye to Dongping, because there are still small groups of Communist troops harassing and disrupting, and at the same time, because the river surface is only 100 meters wide, it is easily attacked by Communist troops on the north bank. Fortunately, 70 to 80 percent of the levees near Jinan, for more than 100 kilometers, have already been completed. The Hebei Embankment Repair Office is scheduled to complete the levees within a month. The situation on the north bank of Hebei is the same as that on the north bank of Henan Province, that is, the Embankment Repair Office has not been able to take over due to the war.

### Overseas Chinese in Wanlong Raise 1 Million Guilders; Plan to Colonize the Xisha Islands

[Central News Agency, Wanlong, 7th] It is learned that some overseas Chinese here are now initiating a plan to raise 1 million guilders to colonize the Xisha Islands. Related personnel told reporters that the initiators of this plan, in view of the bleak economic future in Indonesia, hope that the Chinese government will seriously consider the colonization of certain areas of the Xisha Islands and give priority to overseas Chinese. A number of doctors, engineers, and economists support this plan, and it is believed that after the government grants special privileges, overseas Chinese in other cities will also support it. Currently, 5,000 overseas Chinese in Wanlong have expressed their willingness to go to the Xisha Islands, and the refugees in Tangkilong can also engage in fishing and agriculture in the Xisha Islands. The people who initiated this plan have already raised 10,000 guilders.

### Our Consul General in Hanoi, Yuan Zijian, Arrives in Nanjing to Report on His Work

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th) Yuan Zijian, the Consul General in Hanoi, returned to the country a few days ago to report on his work and has arrived in Nanjing. In recent days, he has met with Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Vice Minister Liu Shishun, and Vice Minister Ye Gongchao to report on the recent situation in Vietnam. Yuan said to reporters on the 7th: "After several negotiations between February 18th and 23rd, the Vietnamese army in the overseas Chinese district of Hanoi was finally allowed to withdraw. Prior to this, the French and Vietnamese armies confronted each other on three sides of the district, and there were frequent conflicts. Since then, it has been possible to avoid some almost inevitable loss of life and property." Yuan continued: "Hanoi has lost its old appearance after being destroyed by the war. There are now only 37,000 residents, including 15,000 overseas Chinese. Haiphong, once an important commercial port, now has only 45,000 people, according to official announcements. The railway between Haiphong and Hanoi has long been destroyed. Most of the overseas Chinese in Haiphong and Hanoi are engaged in business, and they have suffered heavy losses directly and indirectly due to the war. The restoration of the Bac Bo region in the future still depends on the early realization of a ceasefire between France and Vietnam."

Regarding the issue of negotiating compensation for losses suffered by overseas Chinese with the French side, Yuan said: The French side has agreed to pay 2,000 Vietnamese dong first, and a detailed compensation plan will be jointly handled by specially established organizations from both China and France.

In addition, Consul General Yuan expressed great concern about the detention of a reporter from the Central News Agency by British and Indian military police in Saigon. Yuan is scheduled to go to Shanghai to see a doctor within a few days and will return to Vietnam within a month.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] The Hebei High Court retried Wang Yitang, traitor, in the First Prison at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Wang's spirit was very good, no longer keeping silent, but avoiding answering questions that were unfavorable to him. The trial lasted for three hours. Wang, lying on the hospital bed, recounted that he was invited by Chairman Chiang in the 22nd and 23rd years of the Republic (1933 and 1934) to go to Lushan and West Lake to discuss the return of the Northeast, and in the 23rd year (1934) he went to Japan to mediate with Takahashi Korekiyo and Inukai Tsuyoshi, but returned without result and wrote a travelogue of his journey to the east. Wang had frequent interactions with the Japanese throughout his life. After the July 7th Incident, Wang Kemin invited him to participate in the Provisional Government, serving in various puppet positions until he resigned in January of the 32nd year (1943). The court accused him of repeatedly launching security enhancement movements during his tenure in the puppet government, and that the measures such as signing a declaration of war against Britain and the United States with Wang Jingwei were arranged by Wang Jingwei and the Japanese and handed over to him for execution. He stammered in response. Until 5:00 PM, the court announced the end of the hearing and ordered him to sign. Wang refused, saying that he would sign only after seeing the record of his confession. Although Wang's voice was low, he did his best to defend himself. Wang said that he would submit a defense within a week.

### Allied Nations' Appraisal of Japanese Looted Property; Soviet Union Refuses to Participate; Eight-Nation Delegation Begins Touring Investigation

[United Press, Kyoto, 7th] The Soviet Union has temporarily refused to participate in the eight-nation tour investigation delegation that has arrived in Japan to identify Allied property previously looted by Japan in various Japanese warehouses.

The Soviet delegation in Tokyo refused to send a representative to attend the touring investigation team at the last minute. The team is scheduled to quickly identify the looted property within a year. It is learned that the Soviet delegation notified the Allied Supreme Commander that the Soviet Union was "unable to prepare" to participate in this arduous task, but did not elaborate on its reasons. High-level reliable sources expressed the view that the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the touring investigation team would delay the resolution of the issue. Representatives from Australia, Canada, China, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the United States have joined the team, which is headed by Brigadier General Don C. Faith, Director of the Civilian Property Custody Division of the Allied Supreme Commander.

The team inspected a museum on the 7th, which houses more than 210 items, most of which are works of art stolen from China. After the inspection, the Chinese representative hoped that the items would be transported back to China and legally preserved so that the owners could claim them for return.

The Allied Supreme Commander will directly order the Japanese to announce the items they transported from Japanese-occupied areas on May 28.

The purpose of the tour is to enable foreign compensation and for more identification representatives to personally identify the property looted by the Japanese government during the war. It is learned that if the requests of various countries do not conflict, they may be able to request the return of and list the items in the number. At the same time, the deadline for submitting requests will also be determined.

Editorial

### Re-examining the Issue of Commodity Prices

Yesterday in the Shanghai market, stock prices plummeted to the daily limit, and general commodity prices also showed a downward trend, which, according to Mr. Fu, was due to tight credit. This shows that the frantic surge in commodity prices over the past month was probably not unrelated to credit expansion. However, we cannot be too optimistic about yesterday's market situation and simply wait for prices to fall step by step. The issue of commodity prices still needs special attention.

Suppressing commodity prices is a universal demand of the people and a consistent policy of the government. Since the victory, the government has made many efforts and adopted various measures, but the result has been a continuous rise in prices, at most only temporarily alleviating them at certain times. This shows that the countermeasures adopted in the past or at present, even if they are not ineffective or misdirected, are poorly implemented and fail to achieve the desired goals. Let us now re-examine them separately to help learn from past mistakes and prevent future ones.

First, Price Ceilings, Price Consultations, and Price Discussions. At the beginning of the victory, the city already had an organization for commodity price evaluation. Later, it was repeatedly reorganized, and things like rice, sugar, fuel, cloth, and cooking oil all went through a considerable period of experimentation. In all fairness, it cannot be said that it did not achieve some degree of mitigation. Since the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, this method of "price consultation" has been formally and universally adopted. However, the black market has become increasingly rampant, and prices have risen even further. Many price consultations have long been a mere formality, like announcing the new moon with a slaughtered sheep. Recently, the price ceiling on rice was finally officially lifted, and free trade was restored. This painful experience, rather than being a failure of price ceilings and price consultations themselves, is more accurately attributed to the fact that the handling was not proper, leading to the opposite result. The reasons are threefold: (1) The price consultation lost its timeliness and failed to adjust at any time, resulting in the creation of an open black market; (2) The set prices were too unreasonable, and many merchants believed that after selling, they would not be able to replenish their stock or resume production, leading to the bad habit of outwardly complying but inwardly disobeying; (3) It was focused on one area and failed to establish close links with relevant regions, resulting in the phenomenon of the reverse flow of goods or prices exceeding those in the production area. If these shortcomings could have been carefully planned in advance and carefully remedied afterward, they would not have been irrecoverable.

Second, Crackdowns on Hoarding and Manipulation. This is a necessary means for price stabilization and also the most diligent manifestation of the authorities' efforts. Unfortunately, the black market is too prevalent, hoarding is too rampant, and the general merchants and people are too uncooperative, leading to the phenomenon of collusion between officials and merchants, and unsuccessful penalties. Moreover, the crackdown on hoarding and cornering is subject to various necessary procedures under the law, which are stipulated in great detail in the measures for cracking down on hoarding and cornering of daily necessities during emergencies. At present, legal profits have not been clearly stipulated in most cases, and there are no regulations regarding the prices, locations, and times for selling the hoarded goods. Local officials should not be prepared to sell or buy them on their behalf. Furthermore, the hoarded goods and the sales volume are not registered, reported, or inspected with the trade associations and the competent authorities. What kind of transactions are legal? What conditions constitute hoarding? Most people are still confused. Everyone is just doing what they want and coping with the situation as they please, seeking to get by for the moment. Therefore, some legitimate businesses, although feeling the hardship of being constrained from both sides, are unable to cope with the difficulties, while the real hoarders and unscrupulous merchants are all slipping through the cracks of the law, doing their utmost to manipulate and raise prices. We believe that this responsibility should be shared by all parties.

Third, Releasing Commodities to Lower Prices. This is the most practical way to suppress commodity prices. Unfortunately, it seems that the procedural issues of the steps of releasing the commodities, the targets of the release, as well as the prior review and subsequent inspection, etc., were not well prepared and failed to fully meet the ideal, resulting in a great sacrifice for the public, while the goal of stabilizing prices remains far away. It only allows many speculators to muddy the waters and gain unexpected benefits. Judging from the facts of releasing gold, rayon, cloth, rice, and sugar, our words are probably not an overstatement! Some people believe that the public release of goods often follows the black market, inevitably leading to price increases, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of suppressing commodity prices. In fact, if the released materials are allowed to flow into the black market without any investigation, then the general users and consumers will never get the real benefits of lower prices. In other words, commodity prices will never come down because the benefits from lower prices have been exploited by many third parties and have nothing to do with consumers!

Fourth, Tightening Credit. Tightening credit means recalling floating capital, which also eases the degree of currency expansion. Theoretically, it can indeed achieve the effect of suppressing commodity prices. In the past, there have been many practical examples that can be cited. The problem is that before the national revenue and expenditure are balanced, the so-called recall of floating capital is only temporary in nature. That is, while recalling floating capital, it is still inevitable to release funds, which does not have much effect on the overall currency problem. However, between one release and one withdrawal, there is inevitably a wave of artificial fluctuations in commodity prices, and production is particularly threatened by high interest rates. From the point of view of commodity prices, this method cannot be said to be completely successful.

Fifth, Restricting Outbound Shipments. Prohibiting outbound shipments such as rice and flour, and restricting outbound shipments such as cloth, etc., are all aimed at maintaining reserves to avoid scarcity and high prices. The intention is undoubtedly justifiable. However, this is also a temporary expedient and should not be regarded as a principle. The reason is that Shanghai is originally a major port for transit, and its important function is in circulation. When circulation is restricted, it will hinder production. Last year, the flour industry once experienced overproduction and requested the lifting of the ban. After the cloth was banned from being transported to the south, it soon changed to limited exports. These are all obvious examples. Moreover, under rampant smuggling, how effective this restriction is is actually a question. Furthermore, if Shanghai can restrict the export of cloth and flour, why can't other provinces follow suit and restrict the export of food, dividing China into many "small" borders, which will only further stimulate commodity prices.

The above methods have not only been implemented in the past but are still being used now. However, general commodity prices are rising higher and higher, which is exactly the opposite of the authorities' policy of stabilizing prices. It can be seen that from the customs of today, to the customs of the present, to hope that commodity prices can gradually fall from now on, I am afraid it is too extravagant!

Of course, to suppress high commodity prices, it is impossible to solve the problem by simply lamenting and complaining. We believe that, locally, we should not hesitate to spend effort and cost to distribute daily necessities to consumers according to the population, so as to avoid them flowing into the black market. From a global perspective, in addition to eliminating redundancy and balancing the budget on the one hand, and supporting production and increasing supply on the other, there is no other way to follow. If you are greedy for simplicity, avoid reasonable and legal procedures, and engage in "incomplete control" in every detail, the result will only create a black market and fuel speculation! Furthermore, as a result of incomplete control, abandoning night patrols and hindering legitimate production will be tantamount to suicide!

### The French Socialist Party Congress Voted to Support Ramadier's Continued Governance and Passed Nine New Policy Guidelines

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The Central Committee of the French Socialist Party held an all-night meeting last night, which did not end until 2:20 a.m. this morning. By a vote of 2,529 to 2,125, it was decided to support the retention of the government led by party leader Ramadier. Prior to this, Ramadier stated in his speech, "If the Central Committee orders me to do so, I will submit my resignation to President Auriol tomorrow. But I must state that if I sign the resignation, I will feel that I am signing the abdication of the Republic." Ramadier also warned that causing a change of cabinet in the current situation would endanger monetary and economic matters, and should be prevented. Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet opposed Ramadier and repeatedly demanded the government's resignation, but former Prime Minister Blum supported Ramadier.

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] The National Committee of the Socialist Party, at 3:20 a.m. Paris time this morning, by a vote of 2,529 to 2,125, decided to support Prime Minister Ramadier's request to allow the coalition cabinet without Communist Party members to continue in office. According to the resolution of the previous Socialist Party Congress that the Socialist Party could only participate in governments with Communist Party members, today's resolution is a new development in the political history of France after the war. From today onwards, the French government will govern in the face of opposition from the Communist Party and the unions controlled by the Communist Party. Before the vote, there was a 12-hour heated debate. Ramadier and Blum both urged the Congress to support the continued governance of the Socialist Party. After the passage of the Socialist Party's continued governance, the Congress unanimously passed a resolution on the policy guidelines for Socialist Party members in the cabinet in the future. The main points are as follows: (1) Pay attention to the Communist Party's refusal to agree to the policy of suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing wages; (2) At a time when the parliamentary system is being threatened, reiterate the need to maintain the cabinet's united action; (3) The Socialist Party will never participate in a group that calls for anti-communism and will divide the country; (4) If the government is supported by a reactionary majority, the Socialist Party will withdraw from the government; (5) Require the representatives of the Socialist Party in the government to maintain close contact with trade union organizations; (6) Require the representatives of the Socialist Party in the government to find ways to adjust abnormally low wages; (7) Make effective controls on the distribution of food; (8) Urge the government to reconcile the socialist and democratic factions in Europe and the world to avoid the formation of two opposing groups; (9) Demand peace in Vietnam.

[Our News] London, 7th Broadcast: Since the French Socialist Party National Congress voted to support Ramadier's anti-communist policy, strikes have spread throughout the country, threatening Ramadier's wage freeze plan. According to recent reports, at least 50,000 workers in various parts of France are on strike to demand wage increases.

The United States Declares That Its Policy Toward France Remains Unchanged; Italy Closely Monitors the Development of the French Political Situation

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] The rumor that the political turmoil in France was caused by the influence of the US attitude toward France was denied by the US State Department spokesman, who said that the US policy toward France has not changed. US reporters stationed in Paris have sent telegrams saying that if the French Ramadier cabinet can exclude the Communist Party, the United States is prepared to increase economic assistance to France, and that if the French Communist Party attempts to seize power, US assistance to France will be suspended. All these claims are not true. According to a telegram from US Ambassador to France Caffery, all these rumors have no factual basis, and the US Embassy in France is unaware of them.

[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] The French Socialist Party held a closed-door meeting today to discuss the fate of the Ramadier cabinet after expelling Communist Party members. Its resolution may have far-reaching implications for the political future of France and even Western Europe. At the same time, a telegram from Rome said that Italian political leaders are closely monitoring the French political situation. Some members of the Christian Democratic Party led by Italian President De Gasperi have called on De Gasperi to follow in France's footsteps and declare a break with the Communist Party. Most French people believe that the Italian political situation is quite similar to that of France. The conservative Le Monde commented that if the Socialist Party surrenders to the Communist Party, it will be its own demise. We will have two opposing groups in France, just like the two groups that have long opposed each other around the world.

[Reuters, Rome, 6th] Observers here expect that there will be changes in the Italian government in the coming days. It is reported that after Finance Minister Campilli and Industry and Commerce Minister Merzagora report on the country's economic situation to the Constituent Assembly between May 10th and 15th, Prime Minister De Gasperi will ask the Constituent Assembly to vote on a vote of confidence in the government. De Gasperi expressed his hope that a member of the labor association could serve as a cabinet member.

Stating That It May Cause Unfortunate Consequences

Wallace said that if France is chosen as the second testing ground for the "Truman Doctrine," this is likely to happen and it can be predicted that it will cause an unfortunate "disaster." Wallace continued that any attempt to use the vast economic power of the United States to drive France to the right and join the anti-Soviet bloc could cause bloodshed. American observers unanimously agree that "creating such a front in France will inevitably lead to strikes, riots, or even bloodshed."

### The Italian-Yugoslav Border Survey Committee's Work Is at a Standstill

[Associated Press, Trieste, 6th] It is reported that the Italian-Yugoslav Mixed Border Survey Committee, which is demarcating the temporary border between Italy and Yugoslavia, has come to a standstill due to different interpretations of the terms of the Italo-Yugoslav treaty regarding the border near Gorizia. The Yugoslav representatives insisted that the city of Gorizia must be included within Yugoslav territory. The Border Survey Committee is responsible for demarcating the border between the two countries before the approval of the Italo-Yugoslav treaty and the determination of the final border. According to the treaty, if the committee encounters problems that cannot be resolved, it should submit them to the four ambassadors in Rome for a final ruling.

### The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly Passes Three Resolutions: Allowing the Arabs and Jews to Attend and Present Their Cases on an Equal Footing; The Five Powers Disagree on the Organization of the Investigation Group

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss three amendments proposed by the United States: First, allowing the Jewish Agency and the Arab Higher Committee to present their views on an equal footing. This point was passed unanimously without a vote. Second, the Political Committee will not make a final decision without hearing the views of the Arab and Jewish peoples of Palestine. This point was passed after some discussion. Third, appoint an investigation committee to report on the issue of which Palestinian groups are qualified to present their views. This point caused considerable controversy. The Argentine representative expressed opposition. The Uruguayan representative stated that, in view of the friction between the British authorities and the Jewish people, Britain should not participate in deciding which groups represent the Palestinian people. The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia expressed their support. Finally, by a vote of 31 to 4, it was decided to appoint a five-member committee, composed of representatives from Colombia, Poland, Sweden, Iran, and the United Kingdom, to review applications from various Palestinian groups to present their views.

[Our News] London, 7th Broadcast: Government officials in the United Kingdom said that Stalin had assured Bevin that the Soviet Union was willing to maintain neutrality regarding the disputes between the United Kingdom and Egypt over the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the future status of Sudan. The Egyptian authorities have announced that Egypt will submit the issue of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which has been deadlocked after years of negotiations, to the United Nations for arbitration. It is said that Bevin discussed the issue of Britain's position in the Near East with Stalin during their meeting in Moscow. Stalin seemed to attach importance to Britain's position in the Middle East and Egypt, and did not believe that Britain's interests there conflicted with the Soviet Union's interests.

[Central News Agency, New York, 6th Dispatch] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began debating today the organization and scope of the proposed Palestinian investigation committee. The five powers disagree on the organization of the committee, and even on the nature and scope of its tasks. In general, the United States and China advocate that it be a "neutral" committee, but the Soviet Union believes that a neutral committee has no political power or potential. France believes that a neutral committee has no power, and therefore advocates that if all five powers do not participate, then the United States and the Soviet Union should participate. The United Kingdom, as a country with a direct relationship to the investigation committee and as its original member state, is now taking a wait-and-see attitude. Regarding the scope of the committee's work, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and France advocate for it to be as broad as possible so that it can investigate all aspects of the Palestinian issue. The Soviet Union has not yet expressed its position.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] The United States and Argentina submitted proposals today for the organization of the investigation group. The United States proposed that it be composed of representatives from neutral countries such as Canada, Iran, the Netherlands, Mexico, Peru, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Uruguay. The country is authorized to submit recommendations to the regular session of the United Nations General Assembly in September on the Palestinian issue. Argentina proposed that the investigation team be composed of one country from the Americas (excluding the United States), one from Africa, and one from Asia, with the power to collect information and report to the General Assembly.

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 6th] Goldmann, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency, announced that he will fly to New York tomorrow to attend the United Nations conference and present his views on the Palestinian issue.

### Marshall Sends a Letter to Eaton Urging the Speedy Passage of the Aid to Greece and Turkey Program

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The contents of Secretary of State Marshall's letter to Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, are as follows: Before departing for Moscow, I participated in the consultations on the plan announced by Truman to Congress. While in Paris, I also received a telegram from the President informing me of the full text published on March 12. I immediately telegraphed the State Department and expressed my full agreement. The bill was then sent to the Senate and the House of Representatives. I also agree with the amendments proposed by the Senate. I firmly believe that the immediate passage of this bill is an extremely important matter, and its nature is more positive than the recent meetings held in Moscow. I also fully agree with the actions taken by Acting Secretary of State Acheson during my absence, and I maintained constant contact with him at the time. Your committee believes that this bill, by having the United States carry out active security work for Greece and Turkey in the current crisis, can help the United Nations, and this view is extremely correct. I also believe that this move is not only beneficial to our country itself but also related to world peace. I hope that you will take swift action on this bill.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The $400 million aid bill for Greece and Turkey passed its first hurdle in the House of Representatives today. The House voted 168 to 22 on procedural matters, stipulating nine hours of debate and allowing for unlimited amendments.

### Marshall Urges the Senate to Approve the Four-Nation Peace Treaty Soon

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] US Secretary of State Marshall testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, urging the Senate to approve the peace treaties with the four Axis satellite countries, Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, as soon as possible. He stated: Since the four foreign ministers held a meeting in Moscow, I am increasingly convinced that it is necessary to approve these peace treaties as soon as possible. If the approval is delayed, the situation will likely worsen. President Truman once told me: "If we unilaterally refuse to approve these peace treaties, it will be a great misfortune and a serious blow to our country's leadership position in world politics." Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican, also spoke after Marshall, saying: If we refuse to approve these peace treaties, it will make it extremely difficult to make progress on the German and Austrian issues. Observers say that if Italy is allowed to join the United Nations organization and then requests to amend certain provisions of the Italo-Yugoslav treaty, the United States will likely support it.

### Eaton Clearly Expresses That Communism Threatens the World

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Eaton, Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, said today: The implementation of the US aid plan for Turkey and Greece is enough to show the difference between world civilization based on freedom and based on slavery. No pious hope or absurd emotionalism can conceal the obvious fact that communism is advancing towards world domination.

### Gandhi and Jinnah Meet, Discussion of Indian Partition Issue Unsuccessful, British Government to Propose Compromise

[Reuters, New Delhi, 6th] Gandhi and Jinnah held their first meeting tonight since 1944. Gandhi had expressed his belief that partition was not inevitable. After the meeting, Jinnah stated: "We discussed two matters. One was the partition of India into Pakistan and Hindustan. Gandhi did not accept the principle of partition, believing it was not inevitable, while I believe that not only is Pakistan unavoidable, but it is the only practical solution to India's political situation. The other matter discussed was the previously jointly issued appeal to the people to maintain peace. We both agreed that we must do everything possible to make that appeal effective." This letter was jointly issued by Gandhi and Jinnah on April 15th at the request of the Viceroy, condemning the use of violence to achieve political goals. Today's meeting between the two leaders lasted two hours and forty-five minutes. Jinnah stated that his remarks had been agreed upon by Gandhi.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 6th] Regarding the issue of internal strife in India, sources familiar with the matter state that the British government will propose a compromise solution acceptable to both the Indian and Muslim sides later this month. The Congress Party has already agreed in principle to the partition of India, but with one condition: that the cities of Calcutta and Lahore be included in the Indian region. This is difficult for the Muslim League to accept, so Britain may suggest holding referendums in the provinces of Bengal and Punjab to decide the division of the two provinces. A referendum will also be held in the Northwest Frontier Province, where the situation is also extremely chaotic.

### The Izvestia Criticizes the US Aid Plan to Turkey

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 6th] Moscow Radio, on the 5th, broadcast an article by Soviet commentator Anatolyev published in Izvestia, stating that President Truman's speech regarding aid to Turkey and Greece has encouraged Turkish reactionaries to strengthen their terror policy against democratic elements.

Foreign businessmen should negotiate prices and quantities with Japanese businessmen and the Japanese government, sign contracts, and submit them to MacArthur for review.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Social Democratic Party Chairman Katayama will visit Prime Minister Yoshida on the 8th to discuss who should come forward to mediate the convocation of the summit meeting of the four parties: the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, and the National Cooperative Party.

### Rice Grab: Riots Erupt in Six Locations in One Day, Low-Priced Rice Insufficient for Sale, Common People Resort to Violence, Wanxing on Hongqiao Road Suffers the Worst

[Report from this newspaper] The rice grab trend has recently spread to this city for two days and is particularly prominent today. According to investigations by reporters, there were six incidents in one day. (1) At the Taifeng Rice Store at 217 Harbin Road in Hongkou, around 8:00 AM, before the store opened for business, a crowd suddenly surged to buy rice. The shutters were broken open, and four and a half dan of white rice were snatched. Li Guisheng was arrested by street police from the Hongkou Police Sub-Bureau for questioning. According to his confession, he saw people grabbing rice at the store, and he also followed the crowd inside, carrying half a dan of white rice out, leading to his arrest. (2) The Dingfeng Rice Store at 516 East Yuhang Road in Hongkou received twelve bags of allocated red rough rice from the Social Affairs Bureau. By 8:00 AM this morning, seven bags had been sold. Because selling allocated rice required lengthy registration procedures, the crowd outside became dissatisfied and rushed in to grab the rice. As a result, seven and a half dan of white rice were snatched. The police arrived and arrested six people: Dong Anjia, Dai Kerong, Chen Rufang, Chen Ajin, Chen Amao, and Song Caoyu, who were taken to the bureau for questioning. Because Song Caoyu had a nursing infant at home, he was fined 2,000 yuan and released. The rest were detained for two days as a warning.

(3) The Lingwantai Rice Store at 639 Hai'ning Road, North Henan Road received thirty-five bags of allocated rice from the Social Affairs Bureau this morning and sold it in the store. Because the delivery of goods was too slow, it aroused dissatisfaction among the residents waiting in line to buy rice. At noon, all thirty-five bags of rice had been sold, but the nearby residents waiting for rice were still numerous, so they clamored. With a shout, the doors and windows of the store were completely destroyed. Fortunately, the North Station Sub-Bureau heard the news and dispatched a large number of police officers to suppress the riot. However, the residents still did not disperse, so Ling Wantai continued to sell twelve bags of rice, which were sold out in less than half an hour. The crowd was still dissatisfied and rioted again. Subsequently, the Police Headquarters dispatched two armored vehicles to the scene to suppress and disperse the crowd, and the situation finally subsided.

(4) The Wanxing Official Sauce and Grain Store at 249-251 Hongqiao Road in Hongkou, opened by Zhang Jijiang from Pudong, was also stormed by a crowd at 12:20 PM yesterday due to the sale of low-priced rationed rice. The iron gate was pulled down, and people flooded in, smashing jars and sundries. More than a hundred dozen bottles of beer were smashed, and the glass windows upstairs were almost completely destroyed by bricks and stones. Police officers went to suppress the riot, and the crowd dispersed. Only Xia Yumin, a doctor from Changzhou (resident of 37 Haigeli, Haig Road) suspected of inciting the riot, was apprehended. The store suffered a loss of over 20 million yuan.

(5) The Tongtai Rice Store at 96-100 Ninghai West Road in the Eight Immortals Bridge area received twenty-three bags of allocated red rough rice yesterday, which were all sold out by 5:30 PM. Unexpectedly, there were still more than 3,000 people gathered outside the door. The Songchulu Police Bureau dispatched police to disperse them. After the police left, around 8:00 PM, the crowd gathered again. Seeing a large amount of white rice piled up in the store, they destroyed the wooden gate and rushed in. As a result, more than ten bags of white rice and 700 straw bags were snatched.

(6) Around 8:30 PM last night, hundreds of people gathered outside the door of the Yuanyuan Rice Store at 240 Ximen Road, shouting loudly. Fortunately, the Songshan Road Police Sub-Bureau received a report and dispatched a large team of police officers to the scene to suppress the riot. The police ordered the store owner to open the shutters and sell the remaining white rice at the limited price, and the situation finally subsided after all the rice was sold out.

### The Index is About to Be Unfrozen, Various Industries Experience a Mixture of Joy and Fear, The General Labor Union Urges Speedy Implementation, The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks for Careful Decision-Making, Seven Labor Unions Demand Unconditional Thawing

[Report from this newspaper] Both labor and management in this city are extremely concerned about the thawing of the cost-of-living index. Yesterday, representatives from seven units, including the Shanghai Factory of the Central Printing Plant, the Shanghai Factory No. 1, the Printing Industry Employee Union, the Commercial Press Industry Union, the Zhengzhong Book Company Employee Delegation, the World Book Company Employee Delegation, and the China Book Company Industry Union, totaling more than fifty people, went to the General Labor Union and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon to petition the government to immediately and unconditionally unfreeze the cost-of-living index. The index must be compiled accurately, and fabrication must be opposed. The General Labor Union Chairman Shui Xiangyun and the Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau Zhao Banfu received them separately and instructed all workers to work with peace of mind. The central government will make a decision on this matter within a few days. The General Labor Union also convened a joint meeting of the council in the afternoon and resolved to ask the government to unfreeze the index as soon as possible. According to Chairman Shui Xiangyun, although the government has approved the thawing of the index in principle, the specific measures have not yet been decided. The General Labor Union will discuss what measures will be taken in case the facts are equal to the index not being unfrozen.

Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Economics, requesting that the cost-of-living index thawing measures be carefully considered and decided in a way that takes into account the interests of both labor and management. The original telegram stated: "The thawing of the cost-of-living index brings a mixture of joy and fear to various industrial and commercial sectors. What is pleasing is that the minimum living standards of workers will be reasonably guaranteed, so they will work with peace of mind and improve efficiency, benefiting the future of production. What is worrying is that in view of the threat of high wages in the past, at a time when purchasing power is generally low, the cost suddenly rises sharply, and it is impossible to predict, which will make national industries unable to bear the burden. How should we take both into account and make a compromise? We only hope that the central government will conduct thorough research and make careful decisions so that labor and management will be treated equally and there will be no difficulties in implementation after the announcement."

In addition, there is more than one method for thawing the index agreed upon by Minister Gu in Shanghai this time. In addition to the two types published in the newspaper yesterday, there is another type. That is, wages are divided into levels of 30 yuan, 30 yuan to 100 yuan, 101 yuan to 150 yuan, 151 yuan to 200 yuan, and another level for wages above 200 yuan. Except for the basic amount of 30 yuan, which is not discounted, the rest are given considerable discounts according to the size of the wages. Relevant persons said that all these methods are not currently finalized. The government will naturally take into account the interests of both labor and Yan and decide. Both parties should wait quietly for the results at this time and should not make any statements beforehand.

[Further News] According to Wu Kaixian: The thawing plan and implementation details were handed over to Wang Jiashu, director of the Organization Department, on the evening of the 6th to be presented to Minister Gu first. I will go to Nanjing on the evening of the 8th. The administrative meeting in Nanjing on the 9th may discuss the issue of prices and the index. I will personally attend to explain the various clauses of the thawing plan, hoping to make it pass smoothly." According to his observation, the thawing index plan may be passed at the meeting on the 9th.

In the event of a fire, they often have to borrow tap water from the alleys to meet the urgent needs, which is insufficient and affects firefighting work. After Speaker Pan was informed, he also believed that the Taiping fire hydrants were the mainstay of firefighting water sources and should be urgently inspected and repaired. He has agreed to forward a letter to the competent authority for thorough investigation and handling.

[Report from this newspaper] The Frenchman Langelan, who was accused of serving as the station chief of the Pseudo-Ministry of Communications Shanghai Radio Station, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by the High Court on December 5 last year.

[Report from this newspaper] The Direct Tax Bureau recently found that the invoices used by Xinhua Bakelite Factory at 27 Deyuli, 698 Zhejiang Middle Road, Xushengtai Copper-Tin Hardware Store, and 713 Hankou Road, Shidexing Box Factory, had three types of stamps affixed: five yuan (temporarily acting as 500 yuan), thirty yuan, and fifty yuan (temporarily acting as 1,000 yuan). However, after investigation, the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued this type of "temporary" stamp, so the persons in charge of the three companies were summoned for questioning.

### Residents Allocated Enemy-Rented Houses Organize Fellowship Association; Will Request Confirmation of Priority Right to Continue Renting

The former "Housing Allocation Committee for Various Agencies of the Executive Yuan" allocated non-enemy property rented by enemy puppets in this city to public school teachers for residence in order to solve the housing problem of public school teachers in this city after the victory. According to the original allocation method, after the term of the unified rental expires, residents may negotiate with the landlord to sign a lease and continue to live there. However, due to the severe housing shortage in this city and the uncorrected bad habit of "gold bars for roof," many landlords and leasing agents are taking the opportunity to refuse to sign leases with the existing allocated residents, attempting to force them to move out and re-rent at high prices to obtain illegitimate profits. In order to fight for the priority right to continue renting, the personnel in the allocated houses of various agencies established the "Fellowship Association of Residents Allocated Enemy-Rented Houses." The first meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the China News Photography Agency on North Sichuan Road. More than a hundred personnel from the allocated houses of various agencies attended. They unanimously held that the allocated houses were obtained by enemy aliens through contracts with the landlords, and the government has the right to take them over and allocate them to public school teachers for renting. Rent is paid in the same way, and the original owner's property rights are not damaged at all. The allocated residents have now obtained legal tenancy rights, and according to the custom of housing rental in this city and the current severe housing situation, they naturally have the priority right to continue renting. The landlords have absolutely no reason to take them back and re-rent for profit. Therefore, the following resolutions were unanimously passed: (1) The China News Photography Agency is designated as the association's office address. (2) All residents allocated houses in this city will be mobilized to register with the association to expand the organization. (3) Several well-known lawyers in this city will be hired as legal counsel for the association. (4) The administrative and judicial authorities will be requested to confirm the priority right of the current residents of all allocated enemy-rented houses to continue renting according to law, and it is strictly forbidden for landlords and leasing agents to privately rent to others or refuse to sign contracts with the current residents for any reason. Violators should be held responsible for harming public interests, affecting social order, and infringing on the state's right to take over (enemy alien tenancy rights). (5) Action steps: 1. Representatives will be sent to the relevant agencies to express their opinions. 2. Representatives will be sent to the central authorities in Beijing to request amendments to the original allocation method and the formulation of supplementary methods. 3. If necessary, all allocated residents will be mobilized to hold large-scale petitions and parades. 4. If any allocated resident has a lawsuit with the landlord, the association will represent all residents and participate in the lawsuit together to strive for legal protection. 5. Expose the various shady dealings of leasing agents.

### Salary Problems of Railway Bureau Employees Will Be Discussed by the Ministry to Find a Solution

It is learned that the salary difference of the bureau's employees is determined by the Executive Yuan, and it varies in Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou and along the Two Railway Bureau lines. The total amount of the salary difference for all employees in February was more than 3.2 billion yuan, and the amount of the salary difference for last month has not yet been announced by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry of Communications yesterday instructed the bureau to calculate the salaries of employees in various locations separately by long-distance telephone.

### Graduating Students of National Central University and Others Oppose Comprehensive Graduation Examination; Hold Press Conference in Nanjing Yesterday to Explain Reasons

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Joint Association of Graduating Students of National Central University, Jinling University, and Ginling Women's College held a press conference on the afternoon of the 7th to explain the reasons for requesting exemption from the comprehensive graduation examination this year, and listed various difficulties, the most important of which are: (1) Due to the recovery and relocation in the previous year, the school year ended early, and some courses were not completed or were not opened at all, and were left to be taught this year, so the coursework this year is particularly busy. (2) The school term started too late this semester, and the class time is extremely short. The urgency of the coursework is conceivable. (3) Notes or books have been lost due to the relocation and resettlement, and the library in the school cannot borrow books, so it is impossible to prepare for the comprehensive examination. (4) After the relocation and recovery, the professors have changed a lot, and the teaching materials used by each person are different, which makes the comprehensive examination more difficult. (5) Among the students who returned from military service, some of the courses exempted from credits are subjects that must be tested in the comprehensive examination. They have no notes, cannot borrow books, and do not know what to do.

### Municipal Education Bureau Invited University and High School Principals Yesterday to Discuss Joint Examination Methods; Draft Approved and to be Submitted to the Ministry of Education for Approval and Implementation

[Our Newspaper] Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Deputy Director Li Ximou, are planning to jointly hold the entrance examinations for various universities in the city and the high school graduation examinations this summer. They previously invited the presidents of various universities to discuss this matter preliminarily, and all expressed their approval. However, as this is an unprecedented move and further consultation is needed, they invited presidents of colleges and universities and principals of public and private high schools to a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday. Present were Zhu Jingnong of Guanghua University, Dong Xifan of Tongji University, Li Shouyong of Jinan University, Qiu Weiyu of Jiaotong University, Hu Wenyao of Aurora University, Lu Jizeng of Daxia University, Hu Dunfu of Datong University, Zhu Guozhang of the Business College, and more than 50 principals of public and private high schools. Director Gu presided over the meeting and explained several points: (1) University entrance examinations: During the war, unified national recruitment and joint examinations by several universities were held in the rear. Although there were many difficulties, the results were very good. (2) The advantages and disadvantages of the high school graduation examinations have been discussed for a long time without any conclusion, so let's not discuss it for now. This summer, the Ministry of Education ordered Shanghai to hold high school graduation examinations, possibly because many high schools have been established in Shanghai after the war, and this is to test the performance of each school. (3) From the standpoint of us in education, and also considering government laws and regulations, it is necessary to discuss a new and feasible method to help thousands of young students in Shanghai graduate and enter higher education. Subsequently, principals and representatives from major universities and high schools raised discussions and suggestions on various technical issues related to holding joint examinations, which were all recorded one by one as references for future examination administration. The joint examination methods were then approved as follows:

Joint Examination Methods

(1) The first freshman entrance examination for the first semester of the 36th academic year of public and private universities in this city (including independent colleges and vocational colleges) will be jointly held with the second high school graduation examination for the 35th academic year (hereinafter referred to as the Joint Examination). (2) The Joint Examination will be organized by a Joint Examination Committee composed of various universities and the Municipal Education Bureau. (3) Matters such as question setting, examination papers, invigilation, examination affairs, and scoring will be presided over by the Joint Examination Committee. (4) Before the examination, candidates should fill out their wishes for further education or employment after graduation through their original school. If they wish to pursue further education, they should also specify the schools, departments, and faculties they wish to enter in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth preferences, but only limited to the university departments and faculties participating in the Joint Examination. (5) The examination subjects are limited to five subjects: Chinese, foreign language, arithmetic, physics and chemistry (biology), and history and geography. (6) The scope of the questions shall comply with the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry. (7) Students wishing to pursue further education will be distributed to various universities for study by the Joint Examination Committee, based on their grades and preferences, after obtaining the consent of the universities. (8) Those graduating students of general high schools who participate in the Joint Examination and whose scores meet the standards for distribution to various universities will be considered to have passed the high school academic examination. Those whose scores do not meet the standards for distribution to various universities but meet the minimum standards may also be included in the high school graduation examination scores. This method must be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation.

### Yingda University Relocation Movement: Petition Delegation to the Capital Set Off from Jinhua Yesterday

[Special dispatch from Jinhua, our newspaper] All students of National Yingshi University have vigorously launched a movement to relocate the university. The strike of classes by all departments since the 2nd has been reported in this newspaper. According to reliable sources, a "petition delegation to the capital" consisting of 5-600 people will take the Jinhua-Hangzhou bus on the morning of the 7th to Hangzhou and then Shanghai, directly to Nanjing. All meals on the bus will be replaced with steamed buns. It is reported that more than 170 professors of the university, in sympathy with the students' movement and for the sake of promoting the development of Yingda University, have formulated several points of rebuttal to the Ministry of Education's "allocation of university network, Yingda should be in Jinhua" regulation as follows:

(1) Judging from the state of cultural development in various regions, Jinhua is neither the cultural center of Eastern Zhejiang nor the cultural center of Zhejiang. (2) Dividing the university network based on geometric figures on a map, Jinhua is confined to a corner of Eastern Zhejiang and it is extremely difficult to develop. (3) In terms of transportation, Jinhua is inconvenient to travel to and from other places except for a small section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, Jinhua-Hangzhou. For example, students from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing in Eastern Zhejiang have to spend five days to arrive, and students from Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi can only detour through Shanghai and Hangzhou to reach Jinhua. (4) Jinhua itself is backward in everything. Its area, population, education, scenery, and social environment are not suitable for accommodating this huge university. (5) Commemorating Mr. Yingshi should be "national." Jinhua is neither the capital nor the provincial capital, and it has nothing to do with the life history of Mr. Yingshi, so it is not enough to express its commemorative significance. (6) The request for relocation is legally based. Instruction No. 26247 of the Ministry of Education on June 2, 1943, ordered National Yingshi University to follow the instruction of the Executive Yuan No. 7904 of Renjia on January 6 of this year, which was passed by the 606th Yuan meeting, "to be changed to National University from April 1943, and its permanent site will be set up in Wuxing, Zhejiang or Shanghai, and temporarily set up in Taishun, Zhejiang before the end of the war." The professors believe that relocation is necessary based on the above reasons, and plan to designate Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Ningbo as the standard for the Ministry of Education to choose a new campus.

One said that the central government would have new measures to deal with speculation in the cloth market. It was also said that the bulls received a warning letter, which led to panic. The banking group even released a large number of spot goods. Therefore, the market opened in a one-sided situation, with a lot of selling, and the decline was terrible, which was rare in recent days. In the morning, except for Commerce, all hit the limit down. The beauty market outside the market called for a lower board, and Yongsha also fell sharply. In the afternoon, due to the shrinking of the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate, the money supply eased, and the stocks began to turn from fatigue to stability.

Yesterday, due to the tightening of the money supply, the yarn market was busy dealing with the spinning and construction of the yarn number and the delivery of goods. Buyers in the market were extremely rare, and even more profit-taking bulls came out, resulting in abundant spot chips, and the price fell sharply. The closing price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 12.2 million yuan, a sharp drop of more than 1.3 million yuan. The minimum price of 20-count Double Horse was once 6.1 million yuan, and the closing price rebounded slightly to 6.3 million yuan, a small drop of 800,000 yuan. Other yarns above 20 counts also fell by more than 100,000 yuan, and 16-count yarn fell by 3-500,000 yuan.

### Spinning and Construction Sell Yarn

[Our Newspaper] China Spinning and Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 1,089 pieces, including 659 pieces from manufacturers and 430 pieces from yarn numbers. There were a total of 420 application forms from manufacturers and 357 households applying for yarn numbers.

### Falling Prices of Cloth

The cotton cloth market had its prices driven high in recent days due to purchases by non-industry individuals. Yesterday, due to tight credit in the market, and because the Spinning and Weaving Company's supply and sales were quite smooth, all applications for dyed fabric from dye factories were approved, and cloth dealers were also supplied according to their purchase orders. Many holders in the market were selling off their stock. Furthermore, as North China buyers faced difficulties in applying for export licenses, they were divesting their holdings in the market, leading to a sharp price decline. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth fell from 300,000 yuan to 275,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 38,000 yuan compared to the previous day. "Five Blessings" cloth was at 260,000 yuan, also down 27,000 yuan. Other brands such as "Blue Chicken" and "Color Ball" all uniformly declined, ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Twenty-count extra-fine cloth was priced at 230,000 yuan. "Gold Seal" Yuan Tweed fell from 280,000 yuan to 270,000 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" Gold Seal direct-sale wool was sold at a loss of 30,000 yuan, and still lacked buyers. Other colored cloths and Shilin cloth also uniformly declined. Morale was low, and market sentiment turned weak.

### Over 160,000 Bags Already Released, Social Affairs Bureau Revises Rice Allocation Method, North and South Markets Rotate Sales Every Other Day

[Reported by this Newspaper] After the resumption of free rice trading, Mayor Wu instructed rice merchants to ensure transactions occur at reasonable prices and to refrain from arbitrary price increases to maintain the people's food supply. The authorities decided to implement a new method for distributing the daily allocation of 9,000 bags of rice, rotating sales between the north and south markets on alternate days, with rice shops in each market taking turns to supply. Therefore, yesterday's 9,000 bags of white japonica rice were all released in the south market, with none released in the north market. The new method involves dividing all rice shops in the city into 180 units, which will be allocated rice on alternate days, with postponements for holidays. Assuming the rice allocation is 9,000 bags, each rice shop unit will receive 50 bags. The areas to which each rice shop group is assigned, as well as the units of each rice shop group in each area, have all been determined by drawing lots.

Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau announced that from April 15th to May 7th, the bureau had released a total of 161,365 bags of rice. These were divided into four types: white japonica, red indica, Siamese rice, and Saigon rice. As of May 7th, a total of 128,926 bags had been paid for. The remaining are still undergoing warehouse release procedures.

Confused Production Areas Make Cost Calculation Difficult

Furthermore, the Price Evaluation Committee's grain group met yesterday. Rice merchants stated that due to the confused situation in various production areas, it was difficult to calculate costs, so the discussion did not yield any concrete results.

Preparing for Public Sale of Staple Food for the Common People

The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from various district offices and police precincts in the city yesterday to discuss establishing public sale locations for staple food for the common people. Over ten people attended, including Director Wu and representatives from various districts and bureaus. Director Wu chaired the meeting, and the following points were immediately agreed upon: (1) The following units can directly apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for rice allocation: students (including those who commute) and faculty of public and private schools above the elementary level, boarding students of municipal secondary schools, students of municipal secondary schools (provincial and national), students and faculty of private secondary schools, elementary school faculty, industrial workers, dockworkers, charitable organizations, prisoners, and shantytown residents. In addition, Director Wu also reached an agreement with Feng Youzhen, director of the Central Propaganda Department's Shanghai office, that employees of all newspapers and news agencies should be included as "news factories," totaling 1,502,405 people, including 100,000 students and teachers. (2) Each person can purchase a fixed amount of rice or flour each month, with adults receiving two dou per month, the poor receiving one dou and five sheng per month, and poor children receiving nine sheng per month. (3) The allocation price will be the same as that for public employees. (4) Public sale locations will be implemented in nine districts, including Aiming, Zhabei, Yangshupu, and Hunan. After the meeting, Director Wu stated that the plan would be submitted to the Ministry of Food for review and then publicly announced for implementation. After the establishment of the public sale locations, rice releases would be suspended, and household rice allocation would also be terminated. Other citizens can purchase rice from the free market.

Rice Market Gradually Softens Towards Closing

[Reported by this Newspaper] Rice arrivals in the market yesterday were still scarce, with 816 shi in the south market and 810 shi in the north market. Market prices were initially firm, but gradually softened towards closing. High-quality white japonica rice traded at 300,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan. High-quality Bo Dao rice traded at 300,000 yuan, medium-quality at 295,000 yuan. High-quality early rice traded at 295,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan.

High-quality white yuan traded at 310,000 yuan, slightly lower at 300,000 yuan. Yin yuan also traded at 310,000 yuan and 300,000 yuan.

Flour and Coarse Grains All Show Declines

[Further Report] Prices of flour and coarse grains all showed slight declines yesterday. Foreign flour was at 158,000 yuan, down 1,000 yuan. Local flour was at 105,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan. Wheat bran was at 77,000 yuan, down 6,500 yuan. Soybean cakes fell by 4,500 yuan. Yellow soybeans fell by 5,6000 yuan. Red sorghum and corn followed suit with declines of 2,3000 yuan. Raw peanuts fell by 10,000 yuan. Transactions in mung beans were scarce.

### Cigarettes, Soap, and Candles Skyrocket, Authorities Dispatch Personnel for Thorough Investigation

[Reported by this Newspaper] Recently, stimulated by high rice prices, all goods have soared. The cigarette market has fallen into chaos, especially daily necessities such as matches and soap, which have been arbitrarily raised in price, greatly impacting people's livelihoods. The police authorities are taking this very seriously and have already dispatched personnel to conduct secret investigations, and illegal cigarette merchants will be strictly arrested and punished. Yesterday, the police bureau's economic section summoned Weng Ziyou, chairman of the Cigarette, Soap, and Candle Industry Association, to the bureau for questioning. He claimed that the price increases were due to high production costs. The economic section will send personnel to audit the accounts of Weng's stores, and if evidence of manipulation and price gouging is found, he will be punished.

The cigarette market management authorities believe that most cigarettes, soap, candles, and other items are closely related to the national economy and people's livelihoods. They issued a notice to members to exercise self-discipline. The original text of the notice is as follows: "This association's members engage in cigarettes, soap, candles, matches, and other items, most of which are closely related to the national economy and people's livelihoods. All exchangers must not arbitrarily raise market prices or engage in trading on behalf of customers within the market, thereby increasing the burden on citizens. This association has repeatedly issued notices strictly prohibiting such activities. Now, all goods are soaring again, and the government authorities are implementing economic emergency measures to strictly suppress this. It is hoped that all exchangers will pay attention to avoid criticism from public opinion and sanctions from the law. This notice is issued for all to comply with.

At the same time, in order to rectify the market and strengthen management, from now on, only wholesale merchants will be strictly limited to participate in market transactions as member cigarette dealers, and all others will not be allowed to enter the market. It is also stipulated that the capital of existing wholesale merchants must be at least 10 million yuan. Those who do not have sufficient capital must increase their capital in the short term, and those who are unable to do so will be disqualified from market transactions.

### Silk and Satin Unanimously Decline

Due to extraordinarily tight credit in recent days, silk and satin prices unanimously declined in the market yesterday. Artificial silk 120 High Mountain Gloss opened at 17 million yuan, with the highest bid at 7.8 million yuan. The noon closing price was 7.5 million yuan. The market was full of selling voices, and transactions were almost non-existent. In the afternoon, the asking price was still the same as the morning closing price, resulting in a drop of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other brands such as "Gold Three Horses" and "Dongyang" also declined accordingly. 75 Semi-Gloss also asked for a decrease of 2 million yuan yesterday.

Factory-reeled silk also only had asking prices but no transactions in the market yesterday. Grade E was asking for 19 million yuan, but no one inquired. High-grade Another Bale opened at 19.5 million yuan, and dried silk Another Bale was asking for 15 million yuan. The asking prices for each grade were all down by 600,000-700,000 yuan to 1 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Satin goods also had extremely scarce transactions due to credit constraints, and actual sales were sluggish, so factory prices mostly declined. Bedding satin was down 300,000-400,000 yuan, Dacheng Plaid Bi Crepe was down 2,000 yuan, and Hua Jin Crepe was asking for 13.5 million yuan but lacked buyers. Luo spun yarn was also down 500-1,000 yuan per tael.

### Sugar Merchants Resume Sugar Allocation Starting Today, Market Prices Already Showing Decline Yesterday

[Reported by this Newspaper] The second general meeting of the Price Evaluation Committee has been scheduled for the 15th. The fuel group will hold a preparatory meeting first this afternoon at 3 PM.

The sugar group met at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and decided that Taiwan Sugar Corporation will resume sugar allocation to sugar merchants starting today. The prices are: (1) Special grade granulated white sugar allocation price: 350,000 yuan per dan (original price 295,000 yuan). (2) Grade 1 cotton white sugar allocation price: 330,000 yuan per dan (original price 275,000 yuan). The above prices have been agreed upon by Wu Kaixian, chairman of the Evaluation Committee, and Shen Zhennan, general manager of Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Sugar merchants can apply to Taiwan Sugar Corporation from 10 AM to 12 PM today. Purchase permits can be collected from the company on the 9th, payment can be made on the 10th, and goods will be released starting on the 13th. The sugar used by direct users such as biscuit, candy, canned food, pharmaceutical, Chinese medicine, soda, and snack industries has also been decided to be allocated according to the allocation amount of August 3rd last year.

Yesterday, 24 coarse white sugar was 350,000 yuan, and three-and-a-half car white sugar was 330,000 yuan, so the price of white sugar unanimously declined. Peruvian fine sand was 400,000 yuan to 395,000 yuan, down approximately 20,000 yuan. 24 group white sugar was down 40,000 yuan, 20 medium sand was down 15,000 yuan, and Taiwan red sugar was down over 30,000 yuan. Local sugar such as Ti Qing and Diao Qing called for the original price, but no transactions occurred. Shunde Qing was 260,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan. Xinghua White was 400,500 yuan to 390,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan. Xing red was 300,000 yuan to 298,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan.

### Shortage of Thin Serge

Recently, grass green, yuan blue, grey plain thin serge has been quite scarce, and the asking price has mostly exceeded that of medium-thick serge. The circulation of market goods is exceptionally lacking, and the rapid increase in price is unprecedented. The selling price of dark blue medium-thick serge is actually lower than that of thin plain serge because American goods are plentiful in stock, and actual sales are limited in the hot weather. White serge is in great demand and its selling price is still higher than that of various colors as usual. Overall, the most popular colors for serge in recent days, regardless of thickness, are dark blue, followed by grey, and then grass green. Yuan blue is last. In terms of price, grey is more expensive. Application for manufacturers 11179.

### Yarn and Cloth Exported to North China

Application for manufacturers 379.

[Reported by this Newspaper] The Spinning and Weaving Control Committee is handling the registration and review of applications from yarn and cloth manufacturers for exporting to various ports in Hebei and Northeast China. So far, 379 manufacturers in this city have gone to apply for registration. The deadline for application registration is the 12th of this month for this city and the 26th of this month for other cities. After the deadline, the review process will take approximately another week, and permits will be issued.

### Roasted Green Tea Asking Prices Rise Again, New Qimen Costs Are Not Light

Since Tianjin buyers have become more receptive to various domestic sales teas such as Hui roasted, Zhulan, and Dafang, transactions have improved and morale has generally firmed up. Prices remain solid. However, the market inventory of 1946 Anhui roasted green tea is almost exhausted, and sellers are less willing to sell, so asking prices are moving forward again, and the market is uniquely rising. Foreign traders continue to stand by and watch the tea market, resulting in the process remaining superficially strong. It is learned that companies such as Xia Wu Chang and Hua Tea are showing signs of renewed interest in last year's Ping Shui batch, but their prices are extraordinarily stingy, only around 345,000 yuan per dan. However, due to the cost of purchasing the goods, negotiations are difficult to succeed.

(Further Report) Qimen black tea, which occupies an important position in the international market, is now approaching the new production season. It is reported that tea merchants in the production area are actively preparing, but this year, due to the high costs of everything, the cost from raw tea to finished tea, plus the shipping costs to Shanghai, is not light. According to industry insiders, it must be sold for at least 2 million yuan per dan in this city to achieve a small profit.

### Cooking Oil Continues to Decline

[Reported by this Newspaper] The market price of cooking oil continued to decline yesterday. Local factory soybean oil was 550,000 to 555,000 yuan, down 40,000 yuan. Jeep barrel raw oil was 580,000 to 590,000 yuan, down 20,000 yuan. Jeep barrel soybean oil was 580,000 yuan.

According to oil industry insiders, recent continuous price increases and arrivals from other cities mean that oil factories squeezing oil, which was originally unprofitable, now have a small profit to be made. There were many arrivals from Yingkou yesterday, and the cost of soybean oil was less than 500,000 yuan, so vendors are actively purchasing. The cost of Dalian soybeans, the raw material for oil extraction, is still not cheap, standing at 185,000 yuan. However, if sesame is no longer supplied for export, the current oil price is sufficient to cover the cost of oil extraction, and it is hoped that oil factories will adopt it and supply and sell oil.

### Establishment Date of Cooking Oil Regulation Committee Undetermined

Qiu Liangrong, chairman of the Oil Extraction Industry Association, told reporters yesterday that the authorities are preparing to establish a Cooking Oil Regulation Committee to supply the Shanghai market with cooking oil, originally planned to be established within days. However, regarding the point that the government would bear all losses from future cooking oil allocation, the Central China Vegetable Oil Factory had previously prepared a calculation table and submitted it to the municipal government for review before the Central Farmers Bank could provide loans for procurement. However, after Mayor Wu considered it, he believed that if the government subsidized the difference between future cooking oil fluctuations and allocation prices each month, the amount would be enormous and would need to be verified and implemented by the authorities. Relevant parties have already sent personnel to Beijing to discuss with the central authorities, and a decision should be made within days.

### New Announced Wholesale Prices for Huangbai Xiangmao and Sunlight Soap, Black Market Soap Prices Fall Back

The China Soap Company, in view of the rising costs of soap-making raw materials such as caustic soda and Japanese essential oils, which have made the original wholesale prices of various soap brands insufficient to cover costs, has readjusted the wholesale soap prices to maintain cost-effective shipments and supply to the market. The wholesale price of 120-block Huang Xiangmao soap has been changed to 250,000 yuan per box, the wholesale price of 160-block Bai Xiangmao soap has been changed to 320,000 yuan per box, and the wholesale price of 200-block Sunlight soap has been changed to 380,000 yuan per box. The company is implementing the allocation of goods since the new price adjustment. Each distributor will receive 10 boxes of Huang Xiangmao, 10 boxes of Bai Xiangmao, and 4 boxes of Sunlight soap, totaling 24 boxes. After the news of this allocation was revealed, the black market price of soap immediately fell back.

### Spring Cocoon Loan Measures

### Nanjing Political Issues Symposium: Tasks for the New Government - Collective Opinions

For political progress to occur, beyond the qualifications of those in power, another condition is needed: establishing a fresh and potent "political criticism," one that issues relatively sound criticisms, providing the nation's people with an accurate understanding at all times. On the other hand, it can also offer valuable suggestions as a reference for those who are burdened with official duties. Here is a gathering of aspiring and capable core cadres in Nanjing, who discuss national affairs in the form of timely symposia. The most recent one was held on May 4th at No. 4, Dangong Lane, Nanjing. The participants included Mao Songnian, Wang Shuzeng, Wang Xigeng, Zhong Zhaoxiang, Cheng Tixuan, Gu Fengxiang, He Zengyuan, Wu Xingzhou, Jin Shaoxian, Chen Manruo, Cao Yiyuan, Yang Junmai, Zhao Zhangfu, Qian Qinglian, Luo Wanlei, and over thirty others. The topic was "Tasks for the New Government." A summary of the discussion is recorded below:

The so-called new government refers to the reorganized National Government Committee and the five Yuan. However, the exercise of central ruling power and the management of public affairs are truly concentrated in the Executive Yuan. Therefore, what the world focuses on with the new government is what the Executive Yuan will do to break through the current difficulties and create a new path for the future. This is an unfinished task of the previous government and, in essence, does not differ due to the participation of the Kuomintang and the Youth Party.

Premier Zhang Qun's inaugural broadcast on April 23rd emphasized the trial implementation of the Executive Yuan's responsibility system. He then stated that the next eight months would be a transitional phase from tutelage to constitutionalism, and the government's task was to complete the preparations for constitutionalism, restore national unity and stability, and resolve the current financial and economic problems – three major outlines. The entire text was a principle-style declaration, something any politician could say. Even his report to the Legislative Yuan on May 1st did not escape this cliché. If one asks what effective methods there are to realize these principles, it would cost us much searching and investigation.

Premier Zhang once said that future government measures must focus on fundamental solutions. Any matter not related to budget balancing, currency system reorganization, and other urgent and important national and livelihood issues will not be acted upon lightly. His intention seems to be that, aside from these two areas, all other matters should temporarily remain as they are. Those of us discussing current affairs should believe that outstanding achievements must arise from ordinary and practical efforts. Although government affairs are divided into departments, they still have close connections. It cannot be said that other general administration is in a state of stagnation and decline, while miracles suddenly descend, and the budget and currency system alone can reach the other shore first. Today, the primary task of the new government is to strengthen the political foundation and then seek performance. A sharp weapon and good work must consider both substance and function to be effective.

The so-called strengthening of the political foundation involves six aspects: correcting concepts, changing work styles, valuing talent, streamlining institutions, enforcing laws and discipline, and evaluating efficiency. In addition to the necessary official virtues such as diligence, integrity, fairness, and loyalty, those in power in the new government must have an accurate understanding of their duties. Although the nature of the government is transitional, the motivation for governance should not be solely for transitional purposes. Since it is called the Executive Yuan's responsibility system, one should recognize responsibility and dare to take responsibility. The retention or departure of officials should be related to the success or failure of the cause, not continuing the old bad habits, and keeping a heart of dependence on the chairman in everything. As for the concepts of progress and democracy and the rule of law, they should first be established in their grandest form. Only then can one remain steadfast and not be confused when dealing with complex and intricate situations. This is the first point. Regarding future political styles, Premier Zhang stated that the bad habits of falsehood, delay, and procrastination should be eliminated, and a work style that values law and practicality should be established. This is undoubtedly correct. However, the current government has another common trick, namely the ostrich policy. All unreasonable phenomena are knowingly ignored, seeking only to hide the head, unaware of the harm to the body. How can we not administer a strong dose of criticism? This is the second point. Governing requires people, and employing people requires talent. Recruiting talent requires methods. Therefore, the examination and selection system is the core of the personnel system. However, those in power often believe that there are no high-level political talents in the examination and selection system, nor do they intend to cultivate the talents they need within the scope of the examination and selection system. Han Fei said that good ministers must rise from the states and departments, and brave generals must emerge from the ranks. Today's officials, with their art of rising in the world, mostly take shortcuts and side doors, reaching the sky in one step. Few gradually rise through accumulating merits and hard work. With this, they boast about the personnel system and the protection of civil servants. Who are they deceiving? Moreover, the current state's treatment of civil servants has become an object of social pity and ridicule. We firmly believe that improving the lives of civil servants is a necessary condition for strengthening administrative efficiency. The method of improvement can be to set a basic amount based on the cost of living. For amounts exceeding this, forced savings should be implemented. The government can delay payment, and civil servants will not reduce their income. We also firmly believe that cultivating talent in the examination and selection system is the central meaning of strengthening the political foundation. While the personnel system has not yet been truly established, multi-party government is prone to becoming a spoils system. We should also strictly prevent opening this bad precedent. This is the third point. The proposal to adjust institutions has been raised and dropped repeatedly over the years. The central government has also planned it many times, but to no avail. Institutions are like machines and should be just right. Complexity, large size, duplication, and unclear systems are enough to harm political affairs and hinder efficiency. Today, the central government takes pride in establishing more ministries and commissions. Ministries and commissions take pride in establishing more affiliated institutions. Provinces and cities take pride in establishing more departments and bureaus. Each institution generally takes pride in expanding its establishment, adding more personnel, and raising official ranks. We have seen a certain remote and sparsely populated province with simple financial affairs, with worries about the people's livelihood, education, construction, and various bureaus and departments such as social cooperation, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, land administration, field rations, and health accounting, all established to the fullest extent. We have also seen that the organizational law of the Resources Commission stipulates that the number of senior, recommended, and appointed personnel is over one hundred for each rank. We should also see that the functions of the Ministry of National Defense have already been divided and managed by various departments and bureaus, yet ten departments are still established to duplicate them. We have also seen that the current organization of the Shanghai Municipal Government is like the structure of the central administrative institutions. These are all strange to common sense and inconsistent with the law. In the future, the organization should be compact and the titles should be solemn. No institution should be arbitrarily established, no official position should be arbitrarily determined, no budget should be arbitrarily drawn up, and no expenses should be arbitrarily paid without being enacted into law by the Legislative Yuan. Existing institutions established by administrative orders must be subject to legislative review. The excess personnel of each institution should be planned by the central government as a whole, so that they can flow to the provinces and counties, so that talents can move downward and the grassroots can be strengthened. This is the fourth point. Strictly enforce laws and discipline, and eliminate corruption, should have both active and passive meanings. The active meaning is that all measures should be based on the law. The reason why officials do not abide by the law is that there are side paths and contradictions outside the law. Therefore, when it benefits themselves, they promote the law to defend themselves. When it harms themselves, they bend the law to serve their own interests, or abandon the law to seek favor, or evade the law to commit fraud. We should conduct a comprehensive review of the current laws, and a comprehensive cleanup of the separate regulations that are not laws, so that the laws are sparse but not leaky, simple but must be enforced. The passive meaning is to do our best to correct illegal and corrupt behavior. While the punishment of corruption is already subject to the law, the detection and exposure should be carried out vigorously and without hesitation. Officials concurrently engaged in commerce are using their power to accumulate assets, which should be strictly prohibited. A general inspection should also be carried out, and those who violate it should be dismissed. Upper and lower levels protecting each other and feigning ignorance are not a sign of national prosperity. This is the fifth point. Today, the government's incompetence seems to have been unanimously criticized by both domestic and foreign parties. In fact, the presence or absence of ability depends on whether the ruling authorities are wise. If they can implement the above five points and simplify the handling procedures and pay attention to institutional management, then administrative efficiency will come naturally, and the government will be capable without urging. This is the sixth point.

With a strong political foundation, we can then seek performance. We are also willing to offer suggestions on your behalf and contribute some ideas. The most urgent problem to find an answer to at present is how to break through the current financial and economic difficulties. Within ten days of Premier Zhang's inauguration, prices showed a rapid rise. The reflection and results of this are that the government's budget is becoming increasingly unbalanced, currency credit is becoming increasingly inflated, the production industry is increasingly shrinking, commercial speculation is becoming increasingly rampant, the economic psychology is becoming increasingly morbid, and people's lives are becoming increasingly unstable. If this continues, the future is unimaginable. Premier Zhang's broadcast speech stated that, in terms of symptomatic treatment, the emergency economic measures plan should continue to be implemented effectively. In terms of fundamental treatment, the established plan should be implemented gradually. The meaning seems to be unclear. However, Zhang has mentioned reforming the currency system or reorganizing the currency system several times, which is very important. We believe that improving finance, stabilizing the economy, and reorganizing finance should all be advanced simultaneously, using both extraordinary and ordinary methods. We firmly know that improving military financial management is a necessary condition for reducing national financial expenditures, improving collection and eliminating embezzlement is a necessary condition for increasing national financial revenue, increasing agricultural and industrial production is a necessary condition for stabilizing the economy, eliminating bureaucratic and speculative capital is a necessary condition for stabilizing prices, and reforming the currency system is a necessary condition for reorganizing finance and restoring credit. In particular, currency system reform is a prerequisite for all conditions. After the war, currency inflation and currency system collapse were common situations in various countries. However, after World War I, various countries first sought to stabilize the economy and then reorganize the currency system. This time, after the war, the procedure was reversed, and they first reorganized the currency system and then sought to stabilize the economy, because the effect was faster. Our country should reform the currency system immediately, using the government's existing foreign exchange and gold, and changing the US$500 million production loan into a financial loan as a reserve for issuing new currency, which should be sufficient. This is related to the fate of the country and the lives of the people, and the success or failure of the new government. Why don't those in power plan for it?

The next urgent problem is to quickly complete the domestic stability and unity. The government had no choice but to take effective military measures to deal with the CCP's comprehensive military actions. We share Premier Zhang's hope that this appropriate and effective measure can quickly achieve the goal of unity. However, indefinite combat is something that today's internal and external situation cannot withstand. We advocate that the treatment of soldiers at the front should be improved, the supply of military supplies and ammunition should be abundant, and the time limit for pacification must be specified, and the pacification results must be strictly assessed. In the past, people said that generals died to defend, and they would not retreat even an inch. Those who wished to avoid the enemy would be punished if they acted rashly. Today, military orders must be strictly enforced, and military law must be enforced. Li Yishan's so-called "Military orders have not been heard of killing horses, and the victory reports only report grandchildren," must never be seen again today. As for the pacified areas, military and political affairs should cooperate with each other, and should not be biased towards one side. The pacified areas are the fiercest place for the struggle between the government and the CCP from ideology and culture to the social system. The Administrative Yuan's Pacification Area Political Affairs Committee has been abolished, but the political affairs of the pacified areas must not be taken lightly. The politics of the pacified areas should quickly seek stability and order after the military recovery, and provide relief to the people's livelihood, so that the local area can protect and support itself. In the military aspect, it is especially necessary to use considerable military force and time to cover the development of politics, so that it is like the Great Wall everywhere, enough to resist the CCP's wandering and help shorten the pacification time.

Finally, for general political issues, the preparatory work for the implementation of constitutionalism now only awaits the relocation and election of members of the Legislative Yuan, members of the Supervisory Yuan, and representatives of the National Assembly. Sun Yat-sen's legacy originally intended to use examinations to save the poverty of elections, but this system has been blocked and cannot be implemented, and will be completely handed over to the electoral activities of political parties. However, how to make the election serious, how to elect people who are truly enthusiastic about national affairs and have strong political abilities, the population must be investigated clearly, the right to vote must be exercised personally, the powerful must be suppressed, and the virtuous must be praised. We hope that the government will make good use of it, and the political parties will reflect on themselves and not desecrate this sacred system. For example, the separation of military and civilian affairs in various provinces is recorded in the Outline of Peaceful National Construction and the National Government's policy guidelines. Although it is the political capital of politicians, reviewing past history, considering the facts, and measuring the gains and losses, it is a good policy that the new government should follow. The so-called separation of powers should be interpreted as civilians presiding over provincial administration, not that the military chairmen of various provinces have retired, so it is said to be in line with the spirit of separation of powers. As for education, it is the most powerful guarantee of democratic politics. If we want to build a foundation for democratic politics that will not shake for generations, even in times of difficulty, the new government should have great ambitions and aspirations to do its best to popularize national education.

### A Quick Sketch of the Third Session of the Shaanxi Provincial Council

—西安航訊, April 30th. Our Reporter in Shaanxi: Li Chi

The first session of the third meeting of the Shaanxi Provincial Council opened on the 14th of this month. It was originally scheduled to last half a month, and should have closed today. In fact, it was not until yesterday that the administrative reports of the heads of the various units of the provincial government and the relevant inquiries and suggestions were heard. The fact that this stage of the agenda has been so extended shows that the councilors seem to have many taciturn opinions and countless hopes for the administrators. The closing date will probably have to be postponed for several days.

A Unified Demand to Reduce the Burden

Time is the most merciless test. In the seven months between the second meeting and the current third meeting, has the life of the people of Shaanxi really improved? — To answer this question, we may as well quote a councilor's proposal on the first day: Please review the resolutions of the last meeting to see how many have been implemented and effectively implemented! Yes, in the past ten days or so, we have heard many moving future construction plans in the venue, and even the recommenders themselves do not know when the beautiful "blueprints" that can be realized. The regrets are all covered up by the councilors' tales of blood and tears of the people! Seventy-five-year-old councilor Luo Shian said with tears in his eyes: "I came to Xi'an from Zhenping, Southern Shaanxi, to attend the meeting. The folks in the town cried and sent me out of the city, asking me to appeal to this meeting for relief and to reduce the burden. The people of Zhenping are too pitiful!" Reducing the burden is the unanimous demand of the people of Shaanxi.

Calls for Honesty at the Meeting

Every day at the venue, I really don't know how many times I have to hear this common idiom: "The people can't do it!" As a result, the first council meeting years ago mentioned that the girls in Southern Shaanxi were so poor that they had no pants to wear. Yesterday, the old story was brought up again at the meeting, and it was still said that they had no pants, so it was not very moving!

What is shocking is the reported illegal embezzlement and the listing of figures to illustrate the extent to which the people's burden is heavy. The councilors demanded honest and law-abiding "parent officials."

A Clever Way to Make up for the Deficit Budget

Using "donations" to make up for the deficit budget at the county level is, to put it bluntly, just another name for "apportionment"? In a small county like Linyou, with a population of no more than 30,000, more than 3,000 strong men were drafted during the War of Resistance. This year, of the 600 million yuan deficit budget, 100 million yuan has already been apportioned. In addition, the county's public grain is more than 6,000 piculs. Before Yaoxian was completely recovered, its population was no more than 40,000, and its strong men were less than 10,000, but the compensation for building bunkers and repairing pebble roads was more than 2 billion yuan. Coupled with various temporary supplies, each household has to take out millions of yuan every year! The money spent by the people of Chaoyi County on buying strong men is 300 million yuan per month. Hancheng has a population of 90,000, and the compensation for fodder, transportation teams, mules, drivers and carts, laborers, livestock damage, etc., for which there are verifiable figures, has reached more than 3 billion yuan.

New Suggestions on Grain Administration Issues

There seem to be particularly many problems with grain administration. This stage of the agenda, which was originally scheduled to be completed in three recordings, had to be extended for two full days. More than 30 councilors, nearly half of all those present, asked questions one after another.

In response to the current malpractices, the councilors still put forward the following requirements: grain administration personnel must be honest and upright, good people must be selected and appointed, and embezzlement must be strictly investigated. In addition, four temporary motions were passed one after another: (1) The surplus public grain collected from the land tax in kind shall be returned to the local area; (2) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food shall be requested to exempt Shaanxi Province from the 50% surcharge on land tax; (3) The Executive Yuan shall be requested to stop the collection of land tax in kind and the purchase of military grain from the 36th year, and to convert it into legal tender according to the method of real object; (4) The Central Government shall be requested to stop purchasing military grain in Shaanxi.

In order to support and relieve the rural areas, the authorities have done a lot of things in terms of cooperative undertakings, agricultural loans, and water conservancy construction. However, the councilors from the people are still not very satisfied with it, and believe that some places have changed their nature. Agricultural loans, partly because of the delayed issuance, "distant water cannot quench near thirst"; another part of the loan flowed into the hands of high-interest lenders, which instead harmed the rural areas. Although water conservancy construction has had considerable practical effects and increased agricultural production a lot, the burden on farmers has also increased at the same time since the water fee was changed to collection in kind.

Three Major Problems in Current Education

Looking back at education, teachers, academic atmosphere, and funding are the three major problems at present. For example, the "Bao Xue" established by the "Bao" is headed by the Bao Chief, who is illiterate. How can education be run well? At the end of last month, two middle schools in Yang County competed in basketball and clashed with each other, injuring sixteen or seventeen people and killing three. The school building of the provincial No. 7 Middle School was completely burned down, and the provincial middle school in Yang County was looted. Is this the "academic atmosphere" that should exist today? Talking about funding: some national schools have been in arrears with their salaries for several months to half a year. A certain high school only has 20,000 yuan in monthly office expenses, so naturally there is no mention of how the teachers' salaries are.

### Chairman Chiang in Jinan

— Jinan, 4th Day Air Dispatch by He Bingru

Chairman Chiang of the National Government flew to Jinan from Nanjing on May 3rd for an inspection and returned to Nanjing on May 4th. Chairman Chiang had previously visited Jinan after the Battle of Laiwu, Tusi Pass in central Shandong, but due to the need for secrecy at the time, the Jinan newspapers did not disclose the news. However, newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places still published the information. After all, it is not easy to keep the movements of a head of state secret. Chairman Chiang's visit to Jinan this time coincided with the anniversaries of the May 3rd and May 4th Incidents. On this day in 1928, Chairman Chiang was the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Expeditionary Army, leading a large army to Jinan. Because the Japanese invaders dispatched troops to prevent the Northern Expeditionary Army from advancing north, the May 3rd Massacre occurred. Chairman Chiang was forced by circumstances to leave Jinan immediately and retreated to Dangjiazhuang. Although he later detoured north for the Northern Expedition and eventually completed the revolutionary unification, the national humiliation of the May 3rd Massacre remained forever in the hearts of every Chinese person. Now, having defeated the Japanese invaders and in the aftermath of victory, and at a time when the National Army's military operations are turning towards victory, Chairman Chiang's arrival in Jinan naturally evokes considerable emotion and holds historical significance. The 700,000 citizens of Jinan are even more thrilled and hopeful to have the opportunity to see the head of state for the second time after the victory, because the country has won, but Shandong is still ravaged by war, and the people are in dire straits. Everyone warmly supports Chairman Chiang and hopes for an early resolution of the military situation, so that local order can be restored and the people can live and work in peace.

Arrival in Jinan. May 3rd was a partly cloudy day. As everyone was praying for rain, around 3:30 PM, two large aircraft flew in from the south, carrying the head of state, Chairman Chiang, and his entourage. The Commander of the Second Pacification Zone and concurrently Provincial Governor, General Wang Yaowu, and the Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Mr. Pang Jingtang, along with several other high-ranking officials, had arrived at the airport early to welcome them. The first to land was the "Meiling" plane, followed by military aircraft number 260. These two planes carried the leading figures of the nation. In addition to Chairman Chiang and his second son, Chiang Wei-kuo, those who came along included Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense Ministry, Chen Cheng, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the National Government, Yu Jishi, and Director Liu Weizhang of the National Defense Ministry, as well as more than twenty senior staff members. Chairman Chiang and Chief of Staff Chen stepped off the plane in military uniform, smiling broadly. They immediately boarded cars prepared by the Second Pacification Zone and proceeded to the Pacification Zone Headquarters in the city for a rest. At this time, the citizens only knew that martial law had been declared, and did not know who was coming. Some said it was Chief of Staff Chen, others said it was Commander Gu Zhutong, but general speculation led people to believe that Chairman Chiang had arrived; otherwise, such cautious security would not have been necessary. Although Chairman Chiang said his mission in revisiting Jinan was to comfort everyone, everyone knew that he was concerned about the local military and political situation, and even more concerned about the local people. He would certainly inquire about the local situation and give instructions.

Inspection. After Chairman Chiang arrived in Jinan, in addition to asking the leading figures of the Party, government, and military about the local situation, he also lightly traveled to the provincial government and provincial Party headquarters for an inspection. At 8:30 PM on the 3rd, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by several bodyguards, went by car to the provincial government in the city. It was after working hours at the provincial government, and there were no department heads or committee members present, only Chief Qiao of the General Affairs Department was at the provincial government. At this time, Governor Wang Yaowu also rushed to the provincial government. Chairman Chiang sat in the chairman's office for a short while, then went to inspect the West Garden, and then went to inspect the provincial Party headquarters. Chairman Chiang thought the provincial Party headquarters was in the city and only learned it was in the commercial port after inquiring. By this time, the provincial Party headquarters had received the news, and Chairman Pang Jingtang, Secretary-General Yang Pengfei, and various committee members had gathered in the reception room to await his arrival. Chairman Chiang got out of the car and walked into the reception room, sitting down on the leather chair on the south side and began talking to everyone. The Chairman first said that everyone had worked hard, and that he had come this time to comfort them. Now that the military situation has entered the victory stage, everyone must continue to work hard. He then inquired about the local situation, and the committee members answered everything, explaining the plight of the local people and requesting relief. Chairman Chiang listened to their opinions and did not sit for long before returning to the Second Pacification Zone.

Instructions. On May 4th, Chairman Chiang summoned personnel from the Party, government, military, and civic organizations to the Pacification Zone Headquarters to give instructions. He first explained that he had come to Jinan this time to comfort everyone. The military situation has now entered the victory stage. The two most important areas are Yan'an, where the main force of the Communists has been largely resolved, and Shandong, where the National Army has also achieved victory in the Yimeng Mountain area, annihilating a large number of Communists. The temporary abandonment of Tai'an should not be taken to heart, and he believed that its recovery was not far off. The work of the Pacification Zone cannot rely entirely on military affairs; it also requires the joint efforts of the Party, government, organizations, and the people. He hoped that everyone would continue to work hard to restore local order and enable the people to live and work in peace.

Farewell. On the morning of May 4th, the news that Chairman Chiang had arrived in Jinan and was returning to Nanjing had spread throughout the city. At the same time, national flags were hung throughout the city, and flags of all nations were flying across the streets. The citizens turned out in droves to await the departure of the leader and to see his glorious presence. In just two hours, from the Pacification Zone to the airport, citizens gathered uninvited along the route, reaching over 100,000 people. The enthusiastic scene was unprecedented. At 10:00 AM, Chairman Chiang, Chief of Staff Chen, and their entourage traveled by car from the Pacification Zone Headquarters to the airport. Along the way, citizens jumped and shouted "Long live!" The shouts reached the clouds, creating a rare grand and enthusiastic scene, demonstrating the people's love and support for Chairman Chiang. As Chairman Chiang's car approached the outskirts of the city, he stopped to inspect the fortifications defending Jinan, as he was very concerned about the safety of the people of Jinan. After staying for about three minutes, he got back in the car and continued on. At 10:30 AM, he arrived at the airport. At this time, leaders from the Party, government, military, and various organizations of Shandong had all arrived at the airport to see him off. Representatives from all walks of life in Shandong, including Pei Mingyu, Lu Ziren, Wu Xijiu, Zhou Ganting, He Bingru, Yang Baolin, Zhang Dachen, He Xiufu, Yu Leting, and Zhao Mingyuan, presented Chairman Chiang with a silk banner inscribed with the four characters "National Savior." The two elder gentlemen, Wu Xijiu and Zhou Ganting, held the banner respectfully for presentation, and Chairman Chiang personally accepted it. Chairman Chiang and Chief of Staff Chen also exchanged greetings with the people who came to see them off, and then, full of joy, boarded the "Meiling" aircraft, which took off into the sky at exactly 11:00 AM, circling over Jinan once to express his gratitude to the citizens of Jinan. Everyone who came to see him off then returned to the city.

Soaring Prices Affect Rent Editor:

My relative is a low-level civil servant, with a monthly income of only over 500,000 yuan. In this time of high living expenses, his family's life is obviously quite impoverished. The price of rice and daily necessities is rising endlessly, which is truly frustrating. However, due to the soaring prices of various goods, our second landlord has come up with the whimsical idea of doubling the rent next month. He has his reasons, saying that the main landlord has proposed raising the rent, so the second landlord has also raised it. Agreed, but the main landlord's increase is extremely small, while the second landlord's increase is double, increasing his rental profit several times over. Moreover, our rent was already raised once three months ago by three times the rent. Now it is being raised again. I know that this is a disguised way of asking you to move out. Once you move out, he can talk to others about gold bars. I think that in this turbulent economic situation, the same situation will affect more than just my relative's family. I hope that the social authorities will quickly establish an effective sanction against this trend. (Kang Zhu)

### Paper Shortage and Cultural Famine

— Caveat

Recently, everyone has been making a fuss about not being able to buy rice. The rice shortage is causing panic at home. But everyone has not noticed the severity of the paper shortage. It is not easy to buy a ream of paper for 200,000 yuan. If this continues, there may be problems with textbooks in the autumn, and the entire publishing industry will be difficult to survive. Former Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu once said that Britain is still controlling publishing, and our country should do the same. Therefore, on the one hand, we should control the import of foreign paper, and on the other hand, we should encourage the production of local paper. The production of local paper has not been encouraged, but the import of foreign paper has indeed been restricted, resulting in today's paper shortage. Is the consumption of cigarettes a necessity for China's foreign exchange? Or is paper a necessity? We really cannot bear to see the country turn into a situation where it would rather cigarettes become popular throughout the country than disregard the bankruptcy of culture. Therefore, we repeatedly hope that the government will relax the import of paper and open up the import of books in order to save the paper shortage crisis.

Former Minister Wang also said that yellow publications should not be so popular. This makes us think that China not only has a paper shortage but also a cultural famine. Although there are also decent publications, they are not as popular as yellow publications. Some yellow publications in Shanghai do not hesitate to resort to obscenity in order to gain sales. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau once banned these publications, but they have gradually been published again, but the content is even worse than before. I don't know whether the Social Affairs Bureau is still paying attention to this type of publication? This situation makes people feel that China's cultural level is too low and interest is too low. This cultural famine crisis is even worse than the paper shortage.

Generally speaking, everyone sees the rice shortage but not the paper shortage, and the paper shortage but not the cultural famine. But in terms of the future of the entire nation, the danger of a cultural famine is greater than the paper shortage; the danger of the paper shortage is greater than the rice shortage.

### Review of "Eminent Chinese of the Ching Period"

— Huang Weilian

Book Title: Eminent Chinese of the Ching Period.

Author: Arthur W. Hummel

Publisher: Washington D.C. U.S.A. Government Printing Office

Publication Year: Volume 1, 1943, Volume 2, 1944

Since the English translation of the Chinese Four Books and Five Classics (James Legges' Chinese Classics) in the late 19th century, these two newly published English "Eminent Chinese of the Ching Period" can be said to be a great work that bridges Chinese and Western cultures. Its elegance of writing, appropriateness of collection, detail of record, and breadth of reference surpass any independent work promoting culture; it can also be said to be a great work in the study of Chinese culture by Western scholars in the past fifty years.

This book is purely a kind of promotion of Chinese history, and imitates biographies; however, the importance and value of the book cannot be reduced due to the differences in its style. The great writer of the French Enlightenment movement, Voltaire, said that history is a great performance. No one denies that the life and career of great men is a mirror of the times; therefore, in the biographies of more than 800 people described in these two books, countless historical performances and deeds can be seen, such as the collapse of the late Ming Dynasty and the prosperity of the early Qing Dynasty, and all other important records and related facts. Therefore, this book can provide various historical clues, so that Western scholars can gain a deeper understanding of Oriental knowledge.

Library of Congress, Eight or Nine Years of Work

All great plans cannot be realized in a short period of time, nor can they be accomplished by one person alone; the compilation of this book took eight or nine years of countless people's efforts, and is the result of the division of labor and cooperation of more than fifty scholars representing China, Japan, and the United States in the Asian Department of the Library of Congress in Washington. But the greatest contribution belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Fang Zhaoying, who wrote half of the total of more than 800 biographies. Mr. Fang's work not only accounts for a significant amount, but also exhausts the material advantages. The records of the most important figures, from emperors, princes, and ministers to learned scholars and poets of a generation, are all written by Mr. Fang; and because of his deep foundation in Chinese studies, his records such as those of Gu Yanwu, Dai Zhen, and Ji Yun are even more outstanding. In this book, he pointed out countless great scholars and the progress and regress of the times, as well as their influence on contemporary academics and the trend of Chinese culture.

Compared with our country's inherent historical masterpieces, such as the "Draft History of the Qing Dynasty," "Biographies," and other famous biographies, the recording method of this book can be said to be much more advanced; this is because the compilation of this book utilized many local chronicles and chronicles, and modern works compiled by Chinese and foreign people; for example, traitors of a generation, or those who opposed politics, or those who opposed academics, which were not taken by the official history, are now included. Furthermore, the deeds of loyal ministers of the late Ming Dynasty, such as Zhu Guozhen and Dai Mingshi, the traitors of the Manchu Qing Dynasty such as Wu Sangui, Hong Xiuquan, etc., revolutionary giants such as Tan Sitong and Kang Youwei, or outstanding scholars of an era such as Cui Shu, etc., are all recorded in detail. Also, because they used countless secret books and personal manuscripts, and even adopted materials that were previously regarded as unorthodox, these great historical figures have reached a considerable position in this book.

Vast Reference Materials, Accurate Translation

The scope of the biographical materials collected in this book is vast and has reference value, such as the personal family background, etc.; and there is considerable progress in literature; and the accuracy of translations, the reliability of birth and death dates, and the consistency of writing all deserve to raise the value of the entire book; the compilation of the index, such as the name index, the book title index, and the category index, is even more refined. At the end of each person's biography, there is also a personal bibliography attached; such compilation work does increase the reference value of the entire book, and is practical. It can be called an important tool for library reference.

Although the greatness of this book is generally recognized, it also has its inevitable shortcomings. For example, regarding the selection of materials, the selected are all ministers, famous generals, and old scholars. Figures in literature, art, science, and religion also occupy a considerable position; but leaders in other professions are rarely mentioned. For example, in the commercial field, such as the merchants of Guangzhou, in the mid-19th century, they occupied a considerable force in the history of Sino-foreign transportation, but only a few people's biographies were selected. Furthermore, the banking industry and salt merchants of Shanxi have a great relationship with contemporary economic and political activities, but they were also not selected. Furthermore, the socio-economic situation of the times, which is emphasized by the trend of modern historiography, is also often neglected; therefore, the social and economic history of our country has become an obscured corner in the study of the history of Chinese academics, and the survival of the fittest cannot shine in this book.

Selection of Figures, Inevitable Omissions

Regarding the selection of individual biographies, there are also inevitable omissions. For example, Ming Dynasty figures such as Li Chengliang, Xu Guangqi, Tang Xianzu, etc., and figures in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, whose life and career were mostly in the Ming Dynasty, such as Ruan Dacheng, Fan Jingwen, Zuo Liangyu, etc., have already been selected, then prominent figures in the late Qing and early Republic of China, whose careers were mostly in the Qing Dynasty, such as Sheng Xuanhuai, Kang Youwei, and Liang Qichao, should not have been omitted. Furthermore, Naming figures in the history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy in the early Qing Dynasty should also be selected. Such omissions, especially in the arts, are too numerous to mention. However, the records of Gu Yanwu and Cui Shu are very detailed, while the record of Sun Qifeng fails to point out that his most important work was in promoting Wang Shouren's theory, and at the same time influenced Qing Dynasty academics; furthermore, the records of Ming Dynasty meritorious official Shi Kefa and rebels Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong were not adequately described. The record of Zheng Chenggong only records his resistance war on the coast, and does not record his achievements in Taiwan, which is also inappropriate; in other words, the records of individual biographies and the positions they occupy are not commensurate and equal; some are too lengthy, some are too brief. Furthermore, the Chinese book titles cited in the entire book only have transliterations and no English translations, which makes it inconvenient for Western scholars to use and is a major shortcoming. But overall, the value of the entire book is that its advantages outweigh its weaknesses, which seems to be an undeniable proof; this book has gained a powerful and new position in Western books on Chinese history, and can also be said to have strengthened a new line of communication between Chinese and Western cultures.

Reversing Old Arguments, Discovering New Evidence

Hu Shi said in the preface to this book: This book is a biographical dictionary of the past three hundred years, and its breadth, scale, and usefulness are unmatched by any other published dictionary. It can be seen that its selection of materials, its selection, and its unified translation are admirable. The original biographical materials of our country, all disputes between the two parties and factions, could not be freely recorded. Modern scholars have widely collected secret books, discovered new securities, corrected the previous biographical styles, published the original banned books as much as possible, and gradually promoted the banned figures of the past, which is quite beneficial to reforming the conservative biographical style of China.

Looking at the Chinese biographical literature of the past, its shortcoming is that it cannot record figures related to foreign countries, such as Chinese Protestants in the early 17th century, figures related to the Sino-British war from 1839 to 1841, and figures of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, etc., and cannot utilize foreign materials. The compilation of this book can utilize Chinese materials stored abroad, which can be said to be a contribution to reforming the nature of Chinese biographical materials. This book can be used as a historical reader of China in the past three hundred years, and can also be regarded as a source of Chinese historical materials.

### The Mysterious David

— Shi Jimei

——My Favorite Book

When I was a child, I shed tears for Amicis' "Cuore," but "The Mysterious David" is a better and more beautiful book, a moving story, moving writing, moving emotions... Even if all the adjectives are brought out, I cannot express my feelings for this book to the fullest extent.

"The Mysterious David," originally named "Guit David," was written by Eleanor H. Porter. It tells the story of a musician and is also an educational lecture.

David lost his mother when he was four years old. His father, in his grief, was determined to educate this only child well. So, he took him to live in their mountain home. Father and son spent six lonely years in a solitary cottage standing on a high mountainside clearing. During those six years, the father taught his son to play the violin, read French and Latin, and recognize the beauty of life and the universe. David was ten years old. He had great conducting skills and outstanding musical talent, but lacked all common sense and worldly experience. He didn't even understand the use of gold nuggets. To him, illness, pain, and death were meaningless terms. In short, David grew up in the most true, most good, and most beautiful sublime education. His soul was filled with good, beautiful, and bright thoughts. But in the real world, he was just a little boy.

When that father became very ill and knew that he was about to leave this world, he began to wonder if the training he had given his child was beneficial?

The father felt that his life was at stake. Enduring the pain, he carried his luggage and took David away from their mountain home. He wanted to send his son into the real world. Unfortunately, halfway there, the father, unable to support himself, dropped his luggage and died in a cowshed belonging to a farmer named Ho Simen. On that moonlit night in June, the pitiful David innocently played the violin to send his father to another country. Two strange letters, two Van Cliburns, and a gold nugget were the legacy his father left behind.

Ho Simen reluctantly kept the child. David began his misfortune. Every day, he had to do many things for Ho Simen that he could not do and did not want to do, stacking firewood, washing dishes, weeding, harvesting, of course, David was neither competent nor happy. Ho Simen hated him very much. Everyone in the village said that this wandering child was educated in some kind of heresy.

David felt sad. It was the first time that his young heart felt sad. Thinking of his father, he worked hard to play the violin in his spare time.

It was that harmonious and beautiful violin sound that gradually made David loved. His friends became more and more every day. A blind child, a college student with lung disease, and his sister, as well as that beautiful and wealthy little group who were always worried, all received David's comfort.

People gradually liked him, this extraordinary, moving, and good child.

David could not forget his world of music. Once, he planned to use those gold nuggets to study at a music school, so that he could play the violin better - but, but unfortunately, something bad happened. Ho Nanmen's bank where he saved money went bankrupt. Creditors were coming to find them for trouble. In his anxiety, a ray of light shone in David's eyes. He gave all his gold nuggets to this couple crying in rags. This homeless wandering child solved their problem. From then on, David's position in Ho Nanmen's family was different from before.

David could no longer dream of his beautiful world - a musical future, but he still played the violin, and because of his violin sound, estranged fathers and sons reconciled, broken lovers were reunited, hatred turned into love, weakness turned into health, and the unbeautiful world became beautiful.

After returning, Ho Simen's music-loving son saw David's father's letter and discovered that the deceased was a world-renowned musician, a cellist. Then, all the ignorant people in the village were shocked. Ho Simen could not keep this child privately, because outside there were tens of thousands of friends, reputation, positions, audiences, and money waiting for him! David belonged to this beautiful world! But after that, he would bring his violin back to this lonely little village once a year to play the violin for this old couple to listen to.

The story ends like this, plain, very plain, without any earth-shattering heroic acts of sacrifice, but there is a lot of love, and there are tortuous and bizarre tense plots, but every moment it grabs people's heartstrings and moves people's feelings and tears.

After reading this book, it arouses people's desire, a desire to see a child like David, who does not necessarily play the violin or is as beautiful and intelligent as him, but must be good, innocent, and ignorant enough to regard robbers and kidnappers as saints, and have a pure and charitable heart...

But, disappointingly, it always feels like most children are too smart. In fact, maybe it is that most parents are too foolish. We only need to see the education and training that the musician gave David. Although he himself doubted its wisdom, in fact, he was very successful. Even though David also suffered some difficulties because of that peculiar education, this world itself is still beautiful, and even if it is not beautiful, it will become beautiful. Why do discerning parents not allow their children to receive some good and beautiful training and education?

Whenever he sees some children who are as experienced as adults and as sophisticated as he is, he feels too bitter for them, like mourning a middle-aged person who is prematurely old, and regrets that they have lost their innocence; at the same time, he thinks of the mysterious David.

### Zhang Daqian Copies Dunhuang Murals

— Zhou Cong

(Color Edition of Dafengtang)

(Distributed by Xuanhe Printing House, Hankou Road, Shanghai)

This collection of twelve paintings are all figure paintings from the Tang Dynasty. The structure is rigorous, the colors are gorgeous, and the brushwork is excellent. The organization and stripes used in the second painting have greatly influenced the Fauvism of modern Western painting and the woodcuts of the Soviet Union. The caisson ceiling in the third painting is an extremely elaborate decorative pattern. The eighth painting, "Mother and Daughter Offering," depicts two prostitutes abandoning their lowly status to become virtuous. It can already prove the degree of advancement in dyeing techniques during the Tang Dynasty. The image of King Cao Yijin of Khotan in the tenth painting has blue eyes and blond hair, wearing a bestowed vermillion robe. The eleventh painting, his wife Lady Li, with her emerald hairpins and golden sparrows, powder and rouge, all showcase the superb skills of figure painting at that time. It is as if we are reading Bai Juyi's "New Yuefu Poems," gaining a complete view of the strange decorations of Tang Dynasty women. As for the aluminum inscriptions on the images, it is like reading Tang Dynasty handwritten scriptures, which is an unexpected gain!

### Between "Just Born" and "Not Yet Dead"

— Dong Yuan

Written by Yu Chao, Mao Dun, et al., printed by Xiaoya Publishing House

China's New Culture Movement is currently in a state "between 'just born' and 'not yet dead'," and its significance lies in the fact that our past New Culture Movement "almost uncritically accepted all foreign ideas, and was so conceptually vague and inconsistent," thus creating the current state.

In this book, the reader is told that in this state between "just born" and "not yet dead," the New Culture should follow a path of "no longer blindly negating and criticizing, but critically accepting cultural heritage," so as to establish a "solid cultural front and a complete ideological system," and harvest the rich fruits for our cultural movement.

The progress of history not only deepens people's understanding, but also broadens people's minds. The eight-year great national war has gradually made people aware of self-liberation and awakening from a state of ignorance. The forging of life is most able to inspire progress. I can confidently say that the articles in this book are all quintessential works that have been forged.

The preface contains such a beautiful passage: "Let the roaring wind on the plains be our teacher, let the free-floating white clouds be our teacher, let the affectionate night moon enveloping the flowers in the courtyard be our teacher..." In addition to these, today's bloody reality is our teacher, precisely because "life is a great epic, it is majestic, it is also gentle; it is like a clang, also like a secluded spring pouring out..." We should learn from it!

This volume is co-written by four gentlemen, Yu Chao, Xiang Li, Jia Li, and Mao Dun. The title of the book is based on Yu Chao's article "Between 'Just Born' and 'Not Yet Dead'." In this article, Yu Chao described:

People's numbness, fatigue, depression, and wait-and-see attitude have dominated the past twenty-five years. Of course, this is not the whole picture of society, but represents a corner. Based on this, the author narrates the beginning and end of the New Culture in the past twenty-five years, which is concise and clear.

Xiang Li's "Sensual Life and Rational Life" and Jia Li's "The Three Degrees of Life" are good guides to life. Mr. Mao Dun wrote "On the So-called 'Three Degrees of Life'" based on them, and put forward a good attitude and path to be taken in life.

In addition, Yu Chao's "On Attitude to Life and Realism" and Xiang Li's "On Artistic Attitude and Attitude to Life" provide more specific guidance to life.

We must learn from life—especially cultural workers—these articles are a must-read.

As Mr. Yu Chao said: "We are exactly between 'just born' and 'not yet dead': the poison of the old tradition has not yet died, and the new culture has not yet taken root universally; our task is very simple, to call the 'not yet dead' to die quickly, and to call the 'just born' to be born quickly..."

This is the clear path of today's cultural circle, and inevitably, we should take this path!

### Feeling After the Rice Riot in Hangzhou

— Yi

The folk customs of Hangzhou have always been very vigorous; therefore, people from other counties ridiculed them saying: "Hangzhou iron heads". Last March, it reappeared, although it is something that should not have happened under the rule of "law", it just shows the "vigorous" spirit of Hangzhou people.

It is said that the cause of this incident was: Hangzhou citizens discovered that the Deputy Director of the Provincial Food Bureau and the Chairman of the Hangzhou Rice Industry Association colluded to hoard rice, so that the official rice priced at 127,000 yuan per picul could not be purchased, and the black market rice rose to 260,000 yuan per picul. Ordinary people had no means of livelihood, and finally gathered more than a thousand civilians in Shishi, Xi cheng, and Qingchun Street, to start a "riot"!

I don't know whether the municipal government has a statistical record of the food supply in the urban area on weekdays, how many piculs are needed every day? Did it already know that all the rice stores in the city were not selling official-priced rice before the "riot" occurred? And did it strictly review the "allocation of rice" report on weekdays? I believe that the municipal authorities must be carrying out the above three issues on a daily basis; then, the people who carried out the review should also bear a large part of the responsibility for this "incident".

The people who cause trouble are all driven by temporary righteous indignation, and are by no means plotting rebellion for a long time with ulterior motives; after the incident, how should the municipal authorities appease the people, announce measures, and how should they provide relief and broadly implement benevolence? Now, to use "martial law" to suppress and deter, "using softness to overcome hardness," it is hoped that those who govern in Hangzhou will learn from it.

### News Summary

— Tieyun

The rice-snatching trend is only present in years of famine. But this year's rice-snatching storm was affected by price fluctuations. Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, and Chengdu have all opened up rice-snatching. If prices are unable to stabilize, and rice prices jump over the 300,000 mark again, social order is worrying.

When a newspaper reporter writes social news, he must first establish a major premise himself. His implication to the reader must be psychologically healthy, and deliberately exaggerating a common influence is too great: at the same time, one's view and attitude towards an event is also unfair.

What do wise social news writers think?

Some say that religion is the brother of politics, and it can help politicians rule their kingdoms. Given the enormous religious power of various countries in the world, and the exhortation of religious figures to "be content and abide by the law," is the most politically meaningful slogan.

Recently, a film "Song of Bernadette" was shown in Shanghai, and some people criticized it "completely", because the film negates science and vigorously advocates the effectiveness of "God's words".

Recently, in a church in Rome, it is said that "fresh blood" actually flowed from the "wounds" of the statue of Jesus, causing a sensation among believers who went to worship.

Although the priest in the church has reasonably explained that the so-called blood is actually just the reflection of light on the oil paint painted on Jesus' wounds, and is not really blood, the "believers" ignored it.

People who have been influenced by the enemy for eight years also know how to play political tricks in daily life. For example, for a little private hatred, they will also file a complaint with the security authorities, put a "hat" on their "enemy", this trend was not heard of in pre-war Shanghai, but now we have seen it.

The spirit of Shanghai people is also declining.

Humans are busy using radar and atomic energy, but we are talking about "fatalism," how terrible this is!

The Japanese have rules and plans to develop various constructions and trades. Their products will follow "Uncle Sam" to conquer the whole world, and China is naturally one of them. But what are the Chinese people busy with?

Zhang Lijingying, a stall vendor in Tianyun Building, went mad after hearing that the authorities' solution was fruitless.

Actually, in this day and age, who isn't a little crazy?

### Business Competition

— Hua

Two Jews opened a store across the street from each other, desperately competing in business. In addition to large discounts, they also came up with various methods to defeat each other, and even planned vicious ideas when sleeping at night. One night, a Jewish immortal walked to the bedside of one of them and said to him, "You can have whatever you want. But whatever you have, your colleague will get twice as much."

"Is there such a thing?" the Jew said, "Then there's no problem, I want to go blind in one eye."

### "New Arabian Nights"

— Wubian

After patiently enduring ninety minutes in the theater, I barely finished watching "New Arabian Nights". Walking out of the theater, I couldn't help but feel sad for these filmmakers, and also regretted the thousands of feet of film.

After more than twenty years of struggle and hard work, domestic films have progressed from "fire-burning" and "martial arts" stories to realistic themes. This is the power of the times and the result of the efforts of those progressive film practitioners. Unexpectedly, on the day of victory, there are still people making such boring films, and one can't help but feel distressed for domestic films.

From any point of view, there is no reason to make a film like "New Arabian Nights". Looking around, there are too many worthwhile subjects, but "Great China" does not hesitate to waste manpower and resources to make this incomprehensible film. Besides explaining the company's mistaken filmmaking route, it can only be explained as a shameful act of trying to make money by any means.

This story is copied from "Arabian Nights", and the screenwriter has made it completely nonsensical, which is really inexplicable. The progress of the plot is entirely at the mercy of the playwright, and the characters here have no thoughts, personality, or life, like puppets in a puppet show. What does the theme of the script try to express? I'm afraid even the playwright didn't figure it out, so how can you teach the audience to understand? Therefore, Dan Du, an "artistic director" who has always been immersed in "aesthetics," tries to use erotic scenes to sell himself and satisfy the desires of petty citizens, but now, unfortunately, even this point of selling has failed. The "sensuality" and "eroticism" scenes in this film are simply dwarfed by Hollywood's "leg" films. As for the flying carpets, flying ropes, and large-scale fighting scenes, they make the audience feel ridiculous and laughable. Perhaps some people think that the films directed by Dan Du Zi will not be too bad at least in terms of photography, written material, light, and angle. Then this film will also give you a big disappointment. This leads me to think that the fate of an artistic worker who cannot keep up with the times is sad.

None of the actors in the whole film are acceptable. In fact, what can you ask of them for such an incomprehensible script? Even if you hope to get some sensual stimulation and erotic satisfaction from the film, it will also disappoint you greatly. We hope that Great China Film Company will no longer produce this kind of boring film.

### The Difference Between the British and Americans

— Guo

Clown A: I would rather perform for the British than for the Americans.

Clown B: What's the reason?

Clown A: When the British watch a performance, they smile for the first time out of politeness; the second time, the emperor has already smiled, and he smiles along; the third time, he understands it himself, and smiles again.

Clown B: Then what about the Americans?

Clown A: Oh, they never smile, pretending they've seen it all before.

### Criminal Asks to Have Brain Cut

— Qilou

The Associated Press has a telegram from Pittsburgh saying that a habitual thief, Ryder, who has many cases against him, recently obtained permission from the court to voluntarily accept a prefrontal lobotomy experiment. During the operation, a certain doctor cut the prefrontal lobe from the rest of the brain. Now this person has been refreshed and eats normally. As for whether he can abandon evil and return to righteousness from now on, it remains to be proven by his future behavior.

According to the method of cutting off the head, there were early cases of it, but it is a pioneering act for criminals to request it themselves. According to the March issue of Life Pictorial, although this type of surgery is still in the experimental stage, it has already achieved a 60% success rate. The criminal's willingness to accept the cut fully shows that there is a tendency in his heart to abandon the dark and turn to the light. Unfortunately, this tendency cannot prevent him from stealing chickens and dogs on weekdays, just like the protagonist in Stevenson's famous novel "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", although he has a heart for good, he cannot prevent himself from doing evil. He must have sought help from his own conscience, but asked himself inwardly, from his self-esteem and shame, he still could not stop him from doing wrong from then on. From the fact that Ryder, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, requested a brain cut, it can be seen that he was never disappointed in himself. Although he is a criminal, he can be regarded as a representative of Adam's descendants. Although our human beings have been full of evil, our conscience of doing good has not died. Our future hope lies in this place.

Someone said that the reason why our world is so chaotic is only because the progress of social science lags far behind that of natural science. After reading the news about cutting heads, we feel that to save this world, we still need science. The long-disputed question of the goodness or evil of human nature should be answered from now on. We should be convinced that everyone has a kind soul, and it is the skin that has never had a solution that makes him do evil. People's talents are different, only different in their bodies, not different in their souls. From this standpoint, our left and right neighbors should also have some changes in their attitudes towards life. This is not to say that we should condone those who do evil, but to treat them as the same people as us and change them.

### Chronicle of a City in Crisis

— Qin Shouou

Director Xiong was listening to the phone.

Old Zhu, who had been provoked to forget everything, walked down unceremoniously and snatched the microphone from his hand.

"Director Xiong, you promised to let us leave tomorrow, but my procedures have not been completed yet! Because your Section Chief Yu wants to talk about official business!" he said loudly, completely like an interrogation.

The other party's face also flushed, showing that he was very dissatisfied with his rudeness.

"At first, he wanted me to ask you for approval, and thanks to your help, you have already approved it! But he wanted me to handle official business separately and add a list, and I followed him to do it together! Now! But, in the end, he said that there is no official seal on my official letter and it cannot be accounted for! Official business! Official business! So many people in China are handling official business every day, and they have only handled it to this day! If such official business is to continue, China will surely perish!" He simply didn't give the other party a chance to speak, and vented his pain. "Now please say one more sentence, will you let us go or not? If you let us, just tell us when and where to get on the bus! If you don't let us, I, surnamed Zhu, will leave immediately!"

Director Xiong, who was being rammed by him, was almost unable to bear it, but listening to him talk about the experience of being repeatedly embarrassed by Section Chief Yu, and looking at his two arms that were shaking violently, he couldn't help but evoke a little of the original humanity.

"Don't be angry! Don't be angry!" He stammered and put his arms around Old Zhu's shoulder, saying as if comforting a child: "Official business is official business, I will let you go tomorrow, how about I see you off on the bus?" (66)
