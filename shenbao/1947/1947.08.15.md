### Economic Reform Implementation Measures: Group Discussions to be Completed Within a Deadline; Expanded Symposium on Property Donations Held

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The National Economic Commission held its eleventh meeting on the afternoon of the 14th. The Secretariat reported detailed measures for the upcoming expanded symposium to discuss the levy of property donations. Regarding personnel selection, in addition to members of the Economic Commission, it was decided to invite the Presidium of the参政会(Participating Political Council), resident members of the 参政会, chairmen of the five committees of the 立法院 (Legislative Yuan), members of the 立法院's Finance and Economic Committees, and the speakers of the 参议会 (Council) of both 京 (Nanjing) and 沪 (Shanghai). The opinions of speakers from other regions will be solicited in writing. The date of the symposium will be jointly determined by Concurrent Chairman Zhang, Vice President Wu of the 立法院, Vice President Wang of the 政院 (Executive Yuan), and Secretary-General Shao of the 参政会. The discussion outline will be based on the original draft of the property donation levy plan, focusing on discussing the name, target of levy, starting point, and method of levy separately. Issues such as how to handle non-compliance, whether to levy on overseas Chinese, and how to deal with foreign businesses in China will also be discussed. Another report from the Secretariat concerned the implementation measures for the economic reform plan. For group discussions, it was decided to focus on each industry in the plan, dividing into twelve small groups: economy, finance, transportation, water conservancy, agriculture and forestry, industry, foreign trade, mining, land administration, food, labor-management issues, and price issues. Each group will designate one or two people to convene, with the relevant minister serving as the leader. Members will be recruited by the group conveners from within and outside the commission, inviting scholars and experts to participate, with a deadline of two weeks for completion. In addition to hearing and passing the above two reports, the meeting also discussed two important proposals. One was the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises. The principle was decided that the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises should be 30% higher than that of other civil servants, and if there is a surplus, a bonus of three months' salary should be awarded at the end of the year. The details of this plan are still under discussion, and it was decided to form another small group of seven committee members – Weng Wenhao, Chen Qitian, Yu Dawei, Gu Zhenggang, Wu Yunfu, Pan Xulun, and Liu Zhendong – to review it first. The other was the "Measures for Foreign Businesses Requesting to Establish Factories in China" proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The meeting decided that, since the attitude adopted by our country towards foreign affairs and President Zhang's statement today have already made clear, there is no need for further discussion, and it was resolved to send it to the 政院.

### Draft Property Donation Plan Completed; To Be Submitted to Three Institutions, Including the Legislative Yuan, for Review and Approval; Levy Target Primarily Large Households

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Regarding the issue of property donation levy, the National Economic Commission had previously decided to invite the 立法院 and 参政会 to conduct thorough research on technical issues. It is now learned that the 豺部 (Finance Ministry) has drafted a plan for this special donation levy, which will be submitted to a joint meeting of the National Economic Commission, 立法院, and 参政会. Once approved, it will become final. The main points of the plan are as follows:

A. Principles: (1) The one-time property tax currently advocated by the general public is not an ordinary property tax, but a tax on the income generated by property. Property income can be levied annually, while the one-time property tax targets the property itself and is levied only once. (2) China's current property donation scheme, in addition to its fiscal purpose, also has the mission of equalizing wealth. If taxes are levied on goods, not only are there too many targets, but it is also easy to involve harassment. Therefore, in principle, individuals should be the main tax subject, and listed property items should be the tax objects. (3) Although it is not easy to conduct a universal survey of the amount of individual property, the wealthy and prominent families in a locality are generally known to the public. Therefore, the property donation scheme should focus on large households as the main body.

B. Levy Targets: Property donation will be levied on individuals whose total property value exceeds 1 billion yuan. Individuals are the main tax subject, and the following properties are the tax objects: (1) land and buildings; (2) deposits, foreign exchange, government bonds, and stocks; (3) gold and foreign currency; (4) movable and immovable property of Chinese citizens in foreign countries; (5) net value of sole proprietorship or partnership businesses; (6) all privately owned means of transportation; (7) machinery and goods. The above listed property items will not be taxed repeatedly when calculating the total value of individual property, and the actual amount of debt can be deducted.

C. Tax Rates: (1) For those exceeding 1 billion yuan, 4% will be levied on the excess. (2) For those exceeding 2 billion yuan, 6% will be levied on the excess. (3) For those exceeding 5 billion yuan, 9% will be levied on the excess. (4) For those exceeding 10 billion yuan, 12% will be levied on the excess. (5) For those exceeding 20 billion yuan, 16% will be levied on the excess. (6) For those exceeding 50 billion yuan, 20% will be levied on the excess. (7) For those exceeding 100 billion yuan, 26% will be levied on the excess. (8) For those exceeding 200 billion yuan, 32% will be levied on the excess. (9) For those exceeding 300 billion yuan, 40% will be levied on the excess. (10) For those exceeding 500 billion yuan, a flat rate of 50% will be levied.

D. Levy Methods: Reporting, nomination, whistleblowing, and investigation. The levying authority is the direct tax levying agency. In areas where there is no direct tax levying agency, it will be levied by general tax authorities on behalf.

### Japan Establishes Revolving Fund for Import and Export Trade

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Associated Press] General MacArthur announced that Japan's gold and silver reserves, valued at US$137 million, will be used as a credit basis to obtain loans totaling over US$500 million to finance Japan's foreign trade. According to MacArthur's statement, this Japanese import and export revolving fund can be used as a credit basis for Allied or neutral private or government financial institutions to make advance payments or goods to develop trade with Japan in the future. He stated: "Allied and neutral countries can participate in this loan. These US dollars will be managed and preserved by the manager under the supervision of the Allied Headquarters."

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese people were delighted to hear about the establishment of a revolving fund for import and export trade to revive the Japanese economy. All newspapers issued special editions to report the three important news items. Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama also issued a statement, calling it the last piece of good news for Japan since the end of the war. Japanese observers also said that the fund can support the position of the Katayama cabinet, without a doubt, because the cabinet has recently become the target of public criticism due to economic difficulties and serious food situation. On the eve of the opening of international private trade with Japan, the Japanese Parliament passed a resolution today, expressing gratitude to General MacArthur for taking this measure to improve the lives of the people after the war.

### President Zhang's Broadcast Address on the 2nd Anniversary of Victory

[This City News] Today is the second anniversary of the victory. President Zhang of the Executive Yuan was invited by the American Broadcasting Company to give a broadcast address in Nanjing. The full text of his speech is as follows:

Two years ago, the Chinese people celebrated the anniversary of the victory over Japan with boundless joy. This day represents that the Chinese nation has achieved victory in the struggle against violent aggressors, and also indicates that the ideas of world democracy and peace have ultimately triumphed over fascism and aggression. A period of peace and prosperity has dawned in the Far East. China has benefited from this victory, and other Eastern countries have also benefited. At the same time, it is also the cornerstone of world peace and prosperity.

The facts of the two years since the war have proven that although the United Nations have won the war, the establishment of lasting peace still requires more effort. The difficulties and obstacles China has suffered after the war are no less than those during the war. China is now working to restore unity, eliminate obstacles, engage in construction, improve people's livelihood, and strive for a correct democratic system. It is firmly believed that this effort cannot be hindered by any force, and it is firmly believed that only after these goals are achieved can peace in the Far East and the world be truly guaranteed.

### On the Eve of Opening Private Trade, Allied Headquarters Announces Entry Guidelines

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch] On the eve of the reopening of limited private trade, the Allied Headquarters issued detailed guidelines on entry procedures and accommodation for foreign businessmen. Medhans, head of the Foreign Trade Section of the Economic and Scientific Group of the Allied Headquarters, said that businessmen entering Japan are divided into four categories. The largest category is the 400 private trade representatives who will arrive in Japan tomorrow. The second category is the "business representatives" who engage in banking, insurance, and other business trade, and their number is relatively small. The third category is "investment representatives," who will enter Japan later. The fourth category includes "government trade representatives," who are those who handle government-to-government trade affairs at the Allied representative offices in Japan or handle "special commercial negotiations," and can currently enter Japan. The Japanese government's Trade Agency can assume the largest practical task in trade. Mr. Mai declared: "Private trade representatives" can individually negotiate with Japanese retailers and the Trade Agency for approval by the Allied Headquarters. After approval by the Headquarters, the Trade Agency can sign a contract and issue an export license. The price of goods will be paid in common foreign currencies or in mutually convertible currencies by agreement. Mr. Mai said that the Allied Headquarters is not responsible for Japanese goods, nor does it provide guarantees. However, if a dispute arises within 30 days of the goods arriving at the port of destination, the Allied Headquarters will decide. Before private shipping institutions are established, the U.S. Shipping Board will be responsible for port affairs. Hotels in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka require US$10 per day for food and lodging. Before freely convertible currencies are stipulated, special payment certificates will be issued to facilitate purchases by traders. U.S. dollars and Japanese yen can be purchased at designated exchange offices at the exchange rate of US$1 to 50 Japanese yen. Currencies that cannot be immediately exchanged for special payment certificates must be handed over in full within 48 hours of arrival in Japan. When leaving Japan, it is limited to carrying US$150 in cash, and this number cannot be exceeded. Japanese yen is not allowed to be exchanged. Traders can use international mail and domestic mail in Japan, but they are not allowed to use Allied military mail. Commercial telegrams from abroad are allowed to be sent. Passengers traveling by train or car must pay in U.S. dollars. Traders can also use their own transportation methods. Traders enjoy the same legal status as nationals of countries not related to the occupation. Mr. Mai said that they must abide by the criminal law under the rule of the occupying government.

### Wang Chonghui Talks About the Treaty of Peace with Japan; The State of Aggression Should Be Eliminated; Foreign Trade Cannot Allow Dumping

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Dr. Wang Chonghui, a jurist and member of the National Government Committee, met with reporters from this newspaper on the afternoon of the 14th to discuss the issue of the treaty of peace with Japan in detail. He believes that the treaty of peace with Japan must be formulated in accordance with two major principles: one is to fundamentally eliminate Japan's aggression, and the other is to give the Japanese people the opportunity to survive peacefully. Regarding the former, Japan's aggression and its systematic existence must be eliminated from all aspects, including military, economic, educational, cultural, and propaganda, and this state of eliminated aggression must be properly maintained. Regarding the latter, the limit to which peaceful survival is attainable should be the limit to the development of Japanese industry and commerce. Its ability to resume dumping of foreign trade should not be allowed, much less to engage in economic aggression and oppress the livelihoods of the people of other Asian countries. Wang agreed that the Emperor System is the center of the Japanese aggression system. From the perspective of international peace and the freedom and happiness of the Japanese people, it should not continue to exist. Only the realization of a republican system can awaken the Japanese people from the theological superstition of the Emperor's omnipotence. As for the status of Ryukyu, he stated: It must not be returned to Japan, but should adopt international joint management or trusteeship (trusteeship by the United Nations agencies or a certain country or several countries) to make it a powerful base and a stabilizing force in the Western Pacific. Regarding the issue of compensation, Wang firmly stated: We should obtain the largest share. Although the assets dismantled by the Soviet Union in the Northeast are not a compensation issue, our country still has the right and should demand compensation at the peace conference. In the conversation, he repeatedly mentioned the lessons learned from the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, which lacked thorough and effective provisions to eliminate Germany's ability to restore aggression, causing Germany to rise again in less than a few decades. He strongly advocated that the signing of the peace treaty is not the ultimate guarantee of peace. The control of Japan should continue uninterrupted to monitor its full implementation of the peace treaty until the policies of the United Nations are fully realized, and then can it be said that the occupation is terminated.

### Commemorating the 2nd Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty; Newspapers in the Capital Hope that the Soviet Union Will Strictly Fulfill its Obligations; Respect China's Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Today is the 2nd anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Newspapers here have published commentaries on this, hoping that the Soviet Union will abide by its treaty obligations, improve relations, and maintain friendship forever. The editorial of the Central Daily News is extremely brief, with only a few hundred words. The newspaper bluntly pointed out: "The big problem today is not the treaty itself, but whether the signing parties sincerely and strictly fulfill the spirit and terms of the treaty. If both parties sincerely and strictly fulfill it, then the long-term friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union can be guaranteed." Regarding the issue of receiving Lushun and Dalian and 新 (Xinjiang), the newspaper hopes that the Soviet Union will "strictly fulfill its treaty obligations and not make the treaty a dead letter." The Peace Daily first analyzed the three major suggestions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which are to prevent Japanese aggression again, not to interfere in each other's internal affairs, and that the Soviet Union respects China's territorial sovereignty and integrity. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet side's excuses for preventing our country from receiving Lushun and Dalian are all misinterpretations of the treaty provisions." The newspaper concluded that Sino-Soviet cooperation is necessary. We should adhere to the Sino-Soviet Treaty position, seek a solution to the outstanding issues between the two countries, and hope that the Soviet Union will abide by its treaty obligations. The Dagang News was full of emotion for the lack of faithful implementation of the treaty and the lack of maintenance or development of the treaty spirit. After describing the facts that the Soviet army obstructed the reception of the Northeast, dismantled and transported industrial equipment, the Outer Mongolian army invaded Xinjiang, and refused to receive Lushun and Dalian, the newspaper said: "We really have no reason not to doubt and be disappointed with our friendly country, the Soviet Union." The newspaper uses whether the Soviet Union returns Lushun and Dalian as the touchstone of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and hopes that the Soviet Union will "resolutely sever many assistance to the CCP's conspiracy to create chaos," otherwise the unfriendly relations between China and the Soviet Union will not benefit the Soviet Union. The Xinmin News also "sighs" at the development of Sino-Soviet relations in the past two years. The newspaper pointed out that two years ago, the people of the country accepted the treaty with a heavy heart, and the country had paid a considerable price. As a result, various events in the past two years have led Sino-Soviet relations astray. The newspaper does not agree with blindly opposing the Soviet Union, "and we are also extremely unwilling for our treaty country to exceed the scope of the treaty and harm the country's territorial sovereignty. We hope that our Soviet friends can value the dignity of the treaty as much as we do, and do not cross the line. Only with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance as the cornerstone can friendly and peaceful relations between China and the Soviet Union be established."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The 14th is the 2nd anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. The Central Daily News' brief and objective editorial can well represent the government's position, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not issue a statement. The reporter interviewed some important people to discuss the current Sino-Soviet diplomatic situation. The following is a record of the interviews. Vice President Wu of the 立法院 (Legislative Yuan) said: "Whether Sino-Soviet relations have improved depends on whether the treaty has been fulfilled in the past two years. Whoever fails to fulfill it is responsible, which is also the reason why we cannot fully recover the sovereignty of the Northeast. This reason is the responsibility of those who fail to fulfill the treaty, which is a great regret. In the future, China and the Soviet Union should work hard to fully implement the treaty to maintain good relations between the two countries."

### Attention Should Be Paid to the Spirit of the Treaty, Based on Equality and Friendship; Wang Chonghui Talks About the Sino-Soviet Treaty

Member Wang Chonghui of the National Government Committee believes that the contracting parties should respect the spirit of the treaty and should not be preoccupied with a one-sided interpretation of the words. Although the various provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship give the Soviet Union certain convenient rights and interests, its basic spirit is equality and friendship. The dispute today is that the problem arises when China exercises its sovereignty in its territory, which is by no means the original intention of the treaty. From a legal point of view, regarding the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, our side is standing firmly on the ground, in terms of feelings, reason, and law. If Sino-Soviet relations are affected in any way, our country will not be responsible." A revolutionary pioneer in both Xinjiang and Tibet, recounting that when the Sino-Soviet Treaty was signed, our side was purely passive. At that time, the issue in Xinjiang had already started, and we hoped to use the treaty to secure Xinjiang. Who knew that after two years, the issue has not subsided, and another disaster has arisen in the eastern border. He believes that being passive has no better ending, and being proactive is at most just this. Building a country is an important task in the history of the revolution. Revolutionary diplomacy should not hesitate to remove the obstacles of evil forces. However, he still believes that in being a person and in building a country, we should understand the important saying of "not going too far," and those who should be responsible should quickly seek to resolve the crux of the problems between China and the Soviet Union, which is a great fortune! Bai Yunti, Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, believes that the Sino-Soviet Treaty has not been fully implemented, which is an obvious fact. As for the basis of the Outer Mongolian border line, it was indeed clearly stated in the treaty, and no unauthorized claims or unilateral changes are allowed. The relationship between Inner and Outer Mongolia was originally peaceful, but the border issue suddenly arose, which is not without reason. It is hoped that such unreasonable disputes will be eliminated because the Sino-Soviet Treaty of the East is valued. In addition, Shao Lizhi, Secretary-General of the Council, who once served as the ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Wang Shijie, the Minister of Foreign Affairs who signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty, were also the targets of the reporter's interviews, but they remained silent.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] According to political observers here, two years after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, China currently finds that its relationship with the Soviet Union is far less friendly than in August 1945, and that in both spirit and action, there is actually no alliance at all. This sign can be seen from the fact that there are no congratulatory telegrams on the second anniversary of the signing of the treaty.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th Dispatch] The 14th is the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Newspapers in Pan all published articles discussing it in detail, expressing regret over the delayed reception of Lushun and Dalian.

### Wei Envoy to Inspect Guangzhou: Met with Various Circles All Day Yesterday in Shanghai, and Visited Madame Sun to Inquire About the Situation

[Our Newspaper Report] Wei Demai, the special envoy, was busy yesterday in Shanghai meeting with people from all walks of life to solicit their opinions on the current situation. At 9:30 a.m., Yang Hu, chairman of the Seamen's Party Department, visited. At around 10:00 a.m., He Dehui visited but did not meet. At around 10:30 a.m., the special envoy met with Wu Xianzi, Wang Shiming, Yao Yongli, key members of the Innovation faction of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Guo Moruo, Sha Qianli, Dong Shijin, Hu Juewen, Shen Tilan, and other representatives of the China Democratic League. It is said that the visitors made many suggestions regarding the current situation, and the conversation lasted for more than an hour. According to Wang Shiming, he told reporters: "When I met with Envoy Wei today, I submitted a brief memorandum, which mainly included three points: (1) Find a way to end the domestic military conflict as soon as possible. (2) The democratic forces of the third party should occupy a position in Chinese politics. (3) Political reforms should be carried out, and civil rights should be guaranteed." In the afternoon, Envoy Wei drove to visit Madame Sun Qingling, inquiring about her views on the current situation. At 6 p.m., acting Consul General Mayer held a cocktail party at the Hamilton Building to introduce people from various circles, both Chinese and foreign, in the city to meet the special envoy. More than 40 people, including Mayor Wu, Zhao Zengjue, Zhao Zukang, Li Fusun, Ding Guitang, Bei Zuyi, Tu Yuqing, and Hu Shixun, attended. The party ended joyfully at around 8 p.m. Envoy Wei and his party are scheduled to fly to Guangzhou this morning around 8 a.m. for inspection.

[Another Report] Dong Shijin, leader of the Chinese Peasants' Party, was invited to meet with Special Envoy Wei yesterday and submitted a memorandum containing six points: (1) the root of the chaos, (2) the weakness of politics, (3) the poverty of the economy, (4) the special suffering of the peasants, (5) the crux of the Chinese problem, (6) China and the world.

### It is Said That Envoy Wei Will Propose That the United Nations Participate in Mediating Our Situation

[United Press This City Report] Well-informed sources say that Wei Demai will propose three major plans to Truman after investigating the Chinese situation. One of them will suggest that the United Nations mediate the current situation in China to avoid China becoming the fuse for a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United Nations should take this action. It is heard that this plan may also include a suggestion to put a certain number of regions in China under trusteeship. For the remaining two plans, Wei Demai may suggest that the United States either completely withdraw its assistance and influence from China, except for maintaining normal diplomatic relations with China, or implement large-scale, full assistance and supervision to achieve the United States' objectives there. Reliable sources here say that the important factors in Wei Demai's mission are as follows:

(1) Wei Demai is now meticulously collecting facts and seriously making his final decision.

(2) Wei Demai is conducting investigation and research work in a completely objective manner and will never be influenced by the friendship of any Chinese person.

(3) Wei Demai does not favor any party or group.

(4) Wei Demai is not unaware of the shortcomings of the Kuomintang government. He has served in China and has obtained good cooperation from the Chinese government, but he will weigh the importance of official information and other reports.

(5) The premise of Wei Demai's mission is to "contain communism," so what needs to be pointed out is that the CCP area cannot be allowed to become a satellite area of the Soviet Union.

(6) It is impossible for China to form a united government, because the Communist Party cannot be satisfied and wants to continue the struggle to achieve its overall control.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] US Treasury Secretary Snyder said at a press conference today that he had not learned that Wei Demai would have any suggestions on financial assistance. If there are any suggestions, they must be approved by the National Advisory Council on International Monetary Problems.

### Remnants of Bandits in Western Shandong Forcibly Crossed, Were Fiercely Annihilated; Center of War Situation Moved to Eastern Henan; National Army Recaptured Anbian on the Border of Ningxia and Shaanxi

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 14th] The remnants of the Communist bandits in Western Shandong, Zhao Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 7th Columns, about 30,000 people, have fled south of the Longhai Railway. The center of the war has moved to eastern Henan. Liu's 1st and 7th Columns fled south from the area between Liuhe and Yejiling on the evening of the 12th to the east of Sui County. The 2nd and 6th Columns fled from west of Shangqiu to the area of Xiangcheng and Hao County on the night of the 13th. The National Army intercepted them fiercely between Xiaowu and Shangqiu, and the bandits suffered heavy casualties. Liu's 3rd Column is currently surrounded and annihilated by the National Army in Xieji near Chucheng. The remnants of its Independent Brigade, more than 4,000 people, have been surrounded in Fantikou, south of Chengwu, and are being fiercely annihilated. Furthermore, more than 3,000 remnants of the 1st, 4th, and 10th Columns of the Communist Army's East China Field Army crossed the Yellow River north from Zhujialou, west of Dong'a, on the 13th. The National Army intercepted them and annihilated more than 1,000 bandits. Moreover, more than 6,000 bandits in the Dongming Lake area have surrendered to the National Army in the past week.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] The National Army has now won a decisive victory in the battle in the triangle area of Lushan and Liangshanzhai. The 1st, 4th, 8th, and 10th Columns of the Communist bandits' East China Field Army have almost been completely annihilated, with a total loss of more than three-fifths. Since Yucheng and Yuncheng, at the southern end of Liangshanzhai, were successively recovered, the brave and sharp National Army immediately adopted a separation tactic to separate the "New Fourth" and "Eighth Route" systems among the Communist bandits, so that they fled north and south, and then defeated them one by one. The remnants of the 1st, 4th, 8th, and 10th Columns of the Communist bandits' "New Fourth" system of the East China Field Army were guided by this strategic guidance of the National Army and fled north to the triangle area of Liangshanzhai, and were then encircled by the National Army using the natural situation where the Yellow River and the canal intersect. On the evening of the 11th, the bandits could not withstand the pressure of the shrinking encirclement and abandoned Liangshanzhai, and seized the villages and towns of Shilitang and Jiajiahai, where the Yellow River and the canal intersect, in an attempt to cross the Yellow River and escape north. Among them were a large number of wounded bandits, baggage carts, and looted civilian women. When they fled north across Liangshanzhai, they were ambushed by the National Army. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 13th, the remnants of the Communist bandits suffered heavy losses. A large number of baggage carts, wounded bandits, and civilian women were seized and rescued by the National Army. The number of those who managed to cross the Yellow River and escape north was very small. The war situation in Western Shandong, centered on the triangle area of Liangshanzhai, was thus declared over.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th] The National Army pursuing the Communist bandits northward in the Ningling-Suixian area engaged in fierce fighting with the fleeing Communist bandits on the 13th, which continued until late at night. Another brigade of Communist bandits attacked Shangqiu on the 13th and were met by the National Army, suffering heavy casualties.

[Another Report, Kaifeng, 14th] Liu Bocheng's remnant troops, at the end of their rope, attempted to flee across the river, but their plan was shattered by the National Army. In order to prolong their last gasp, they fled south through the gaps. Except for a part that was still surrounded by the National Army between Dingtao and Juye and was about to be annihilated, the remnant troops that fled to the area south of Cao County and north of Minlanliu were wiped out by the National Army after days of suppression. They crossed the Longhai Railway on the nights of the 11th and 12th. Their advance troops had reached the border of Luyi County, and the main force was between Suixian and Ningling. The National Army is now capturing and eliminating them with thunderous force. There are no traces of bandits near Minquan now, and the Longhai Railway has not suffered major damage.

### Youth Army Representatives Talk About Their Return From a Visit: Yan'an is Being Reborn, Residents Returning to Their Homes, From Darkness to Light

[Central News Agency, This City] Han Boliang, Lin Zhizhen, and Zhang Guangfa, youth soldier representatives of the 2nd Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, flew to Yan'an last month to visit the current situation after Yan'an was recaptured, and returned to Shanghai on the 10th of this month. Mr. Han Boliang spoke to reporters on the 14th at the Political Department of the Second Brigade, Xinhua Yicun, Xitiyu Road, about the recent situation in Yan'an:

During the Communist Bandit Occupation

(A) The political situation of the Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi: (1) The Party is above everything, completely adopting dictatorial and violent means, (2) The secret service organization is strict, (3) Enslaving the people of northern Shaanxi to consolidate their pseudo-regime, (4) Deceiving the people with the slogan of democracy. (B) Economic aspects: (1) Using a realistic plundering policy, (2) Using the name of struggle and liquidation to lure poor people, turning the well-off into the poor, and turning the poor into bandits, (3) The violent land policy, after liquidating the people's land, the government used the pretext of helping the landlords to take it back and redistribute it, in order to increase military expenses, (4) Using the planting of opium and levying taxes to poison the people to remedy the lack of finance, encouraging the people to plant opium, and transporting the harvested opium to the border for sale. (C) Educational and cultural aspects: (1) Creating tools of partyization, educating to empower the Party, rather than educating to cultivate national talents, (2) Making students loyal slaves of the Communist bandits, (3) Unequal opportunities for schooling, there are only two elementary schools and one normal school in the entire Yan'an, except for the children of Communist bandit cadres who have the opportunity to study for free, the people must pay tuition fees, and after the age of fifteen, they must be managed by the Communist bandits, causing people to dare not send their children to school, resulting in a serious illiteracy situation in northern Shaanxi.

After the National Army Recovered

Since the National Army recovered Yan'an, Yan'an, after half a year of governance, has made great progress. During the Communist bandit occupation, this small city with more than 32,000 people had endured 13 years of "daring to be angry but not daring to speak," and now more than 21,000 people have returned to their homeland and started to live and work in peace and contentment. They rarely wore a complete set of clothes in the past, but now they have put on the clothes rescued by the government. Everyone is wearing a set of white shirts and black trousers, clean and tidy, showing smiling faces, symbolizing a kind of joyful phenomenon, revealing that they have turned from darkness to light. The visiting group visited the People's Education Center, and a large hall displayed opium seeds left by the Communist bandits, which is conclusive evidence of the Communist bandits poisoning the people. Then, we visited the "National Army People's Service Center," where the staff were busy handling emergency relief work. The personnel of the Family Mutual Aid Society solved the difficulties for the people who came back day and night. Children over the age of five can be sent to the Bao National Elementary School for free, and the county government provides books. When the "visiting group" participated in the singing competition of students from five elementary schools, the innocent and lively students were able to sing the Yangko of "President Chiang is the Great Savior of the People." According to Yan'an Commissioner Zhu Baoli, various small-scale industries have begun to be prepared, and they are already preparing to run Yan'an Middle School. The most regrettable thing is that there is still no hospital in Yan'an. The engineering department is repairing the roads along the city, and the Agricultural Bank has begun to handle agricultural loans. Under the slogan "Politics is more important than military affairs," all levels of personnel are confident in rebuilding northern Shaanxi. The government also hopes that young people with aspirations can actively participate in the construction of the Great Northwest.

The directors expressed many opinions, all believing that in order to cooperate with the government's tightening policy, all non-essential loans should be suspended.

The important points are as follows: (1) The ordinary agricultural loans for this year were previously approved at 100 billion yuan, and another 2 billion yuan of Northeast circulation coupons.

### An Overview of the Disaster Area in Northern Jiangsu: A Vast Expanse of Water, No Traces of Human Habitation; Good Farmland Submerged by Water

— Our Newspaper Reporter Yu Zhenji

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] In the scorching heat of over a hundred degrees in the air, reporters and others followed Minister of Water Conservancy Xue Xueshi and Vice Minister Shen Baixian to inspect the flood in northern Jiangsu. A group of more than 20 people departed from the foot of Zijin Mountain, flew over the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Huai River, and flew along the disaster-stricken Jinpu Road to Xuzhou. Then, circling around Weishan Lake, we made a turn to the upstream and downstream of the Yishui and Shushui rivers, soaring over Linyi, Shuyang, and other places. Often, we flew in a color of water and sky for 30 to 50 minutes. When we came back, everyone's mood was heavy.

Six hours of intense flight, more than 800 miles of aerial observation, revealed a shocking fact. In an area only 400 kilometers away from Shanghai, there is land more than ten times the area of Shanghai, submerged by floods, and people more than twice the population of Shanghai are living a life of suffering in the floods. Some of these waters have receded a little, and some are continuing to rise. If they are not quickly managed, then the disaster area will inevitably continue to expand, and the distance from the Yangtze River should also be closer. By then, not only will the entire northern Jiangsu become a swamp, but the prosperous Beijing-Shanghai area will also be completely submerged.

This year's flood in northern Jiangsu was caused by excessive rainfall, plus water from Shandong, which made the situation even worse. The first thing that appeared in our eyes in the flooded area of ​​northern Jiangsu was Weishan Lake on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong. This large lake, famous at home and abroad during the War of Resistance, does not have the beauty of Taihu Lake, and cannot compare with Dianchi Lake in Kunming. Even if there is a little beauty worth reminiscing, it has been painted with a gloomy gray color by the ruthless water. We flew over around 12 o'clock, eating lunch prepared for us by the Ministry of Water Conservancy, while looking at the ground (should be said to be the water surface) to see if there were any chimneys smoking. There is no houses in a large area, so there is no chimneys to talk about; in some places, we occasionally see one or two houses, with one or two dead trees standing next to them, but no smoke is coming out of the chimneys. Looking through the binoculars, there are no traces of human habitation, perhaps they have already moved. One or two feet of water completely submerged the road. Several boats were moving things. We watched the miracle of "land sailing" with heavy hearts. A colleague from Shanghai asked how big the area flooded by water was. The reporter could not answer, and turned to ask the water conservancy expert next to him. This old gentleman had not been to Shanghai, so he only pointed to the map and said to the reporter: The area flooded by water includes a part of Shandong and Pei County in Jiangsu, and a part of Xuzhou. How many Shanghais do you think there are?

In Huangji and Daxujia, which belong to Pixian on the Longhai Railway, we saw scenes of houses on high ground surrounded by water. In the sky, we could vaguely see the lines formed by the roads submerged by water, which were half a foot or a foot deep, but many places were dry land without water, and some places the water had receded a little. According to a colleague who came last year, the water in northern Jiangsu this year is not as big as last year.

It was too hot, and the plane was flying too low. Some people couldn't stand it and pretended to sleep, only a few experts were still turning over maps and taking pictures. This silence did not last long, and was broken by Minister Xue: "The plane has flown to the largest disaster area in northern Jiangsu!" Every plane window had anxious gazes looking. Good guys, how much water there is! And it is all gray and black, at least two or three feet, maybe more. These stretch from near Suqian all the way north, Muyang, Donghai, Guanyun, how many counties, hundreds of thousands of acres of the best fields are soaked in the water, at least as big as Taihu Lake, no human habitation, at most you can see the tops of a few trees. The plane circled over the muddy water, not believing that this used to be land. Not even a single boat can be seen, it is simply a sea. This sea does not know how many people's blood and sweat it has swallowed, and how many people's families it has destroyed. Compatriots more than twice the population of Shanghai are in deep water and suffering, and an area several times larger than Shanghai is all submerged by water. This water may come to Shanghai one day. Compatriots in Shanghai, please do not look at this matter with an attitude of "watching the fire from the other side of the river."

### Editorial: What Will Japan Be Like Two Years From Now?

Two years ago today, after several days of hesitation, Japan finally formally accepted the Potsdam Declaration. The Japanese Emperor delivered a radio address to the nation, announcing Japan's surrender to the Allied forces. Thus, the Second World War, after eight years of gunfire, came to an end. August 15th, therefore, is the most glorious day in human history, especially in modern Chinese history. In theory, we should greet the arrival of this great anniversary of victory with the most jubilant emotions and the most cheerful hearts. However, two years later, when we encounter this epoch-making anniversary today, we are filled with mixed feelings, with countless thoughts and words, and we truly don't know where to begin!

We don't need to dwell on the past, nor do we need to darkly hope for the future. Just looking at the regulations for opening up Japan's foreign trade announced yesterday by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo is enough to make us feel sentimental. The content of this regulation stipulates four methods for opening up Japan's foreign trade: (1) Foreign businessmen trading with Japan will be divided into four categories: 1. Representatives of private trade; 2. Representatives of transportation, insurance, and other industries; 3. Representatives of investors; 4. Government representatives. (2) All contacts between representatives of private trade and Japanese merchants or the Japanese Ministry of Commerce must be approved by the Allied Headquarters. (3) All export permits issued by the Japanese Ministry of Commerce must be approved by the Allied Headquarters. (4) The prices of Japanese goods shall be quoted in US dollars. Superficially, the opening of Japan's private foreign trade seems to be a "partial" opening. Everything must be at the command of the Allied Headquarters, and no free development is allowed. However, in practice, opening up Japan's private foreign trade, whether viewed from an economic or political perspective, is ultimately a major encouragement to defeated Japan. No wonder the Japanese are secretly smiling again. Japan, defeated by the Allied countries, is already planning its comeback in less than two years. How can this not be seen as a warning sign for victorious China?

From a long-term perspective, there are many debatable aspects of the United States' policy towards Japan. However, the US supports defeated Japan, on the one hand, to reduce the cost of the US occupation of Japan, and on the other hand, it hopes that Japan can serve the US in the Far East in the future, just as Japan did for Britain during the Anglo-Japanese Alliance era. MacArthur's policy towards Japan is therefore able to gain the support of the American people, and the reason lies in this. Such a short-sighted policy is enough to cause immeasurable consequences. We should stand as friends and awaken the vigilance of the US government and the public. However, the most important thing for us is to reflect on ourselves and do our best. First, China is one of the victorious nations against Japan, and in the Far Eastern Commission, it is also one of the four powers with veto power. China also has full say in the decision-making of the Allied policy towards Japan. Have our diplomatic authorities ever argued on principle against resolutions that are unfavorable to China? Second, although the opening of Japan's private foreign trade is an order from the Allied Headquarters, each country has the freedom to decide whether to open trade with Japan. We know that opening Japanese trade at present will do more harm than good to China. Why does the government still decide to open it despite the opposition of the people? Third, we assume that the government has decided to open trade with Japan and that there are indeed sufficient reasons. That is, all future trade with Japan will be under strict government and business control, so as not to allow Japanese goods to come in like a landslide. However, we still have to ask the government whether it has strict preventive measures against the large-scale smuggling of Japanese goods in the future? Are there any concrete measures to help domestic industries from being affected by the opening of trade with Japan? Now the national business community is in a state of anxiety. Can the government provide them with strong guarantees?

In short, today is the anniversary of Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, and it is also the day of the opening of Japan's foreign trade. We are happy and fearful at the same time. We are certainly willing to give the Japanese people an opportunity to coexist peacefully, but to ensure victory, we should take precautions against Japan's comeback everywhere, so that this aggressive train can no longer start. Although the opening of Japan's private foreign trade is a partial opening and is subject to the management of the Allied Headquarters, it is the first step for Japan to start its comeback after its defeat, which makes us have to raise our vigilance against Japan. "After accepting the Potsdam Declaration, Japan was able to obtain the opening of private foreign trade in less than two years before the peace treaty was signed, and obtained American loans. The speed of the defeated country's trend towards recovery is almost unparalleled in modern history. Even today's Germany is inevitably dwarfed in comparison. Although the United States also wanted to support Germany first, but when Britain and the United States conducted negotiations to raise the level of German industry, because of France's firm opposition, they had to give up. France in wartime did not know my position, but why is it that France after the war can maintain its inherent position in Europe, and how can it use its diplomatic means to ensure its favorable position towards Germany? This is what deserves our attention most.

### Donate to Disaster Relief!

In the past month, reports of disasters in the country have been pouring in. In addition to the major floods in the Yellow River, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and northern Jiangsu are also experiencing floods. The severity of the disasters is shocking. The people have endured eight years of hardship during the Anti-Japanese War, and now they are suffering from natural disasters. How unfortunate it is!

China, to this day, is a country that is established based on agriculture, and 80% of the population are farmers, who rely on cultivation to make a living. The prosperity or decline of the rural economy is the sole measure of the rise and fall of the national economy. To be honest, today's rural areas in various places, even without unexpected natural disasters, have already fallen into the brink of bankruptcy. The average farmer can hardly breathe under the burden of life. How can they withstand the impact of natural disasters again! We have studied the causes of floods in various provinces, and they are all due to the disrepair of farmland irrigation. Since ancient times, our country has attached great importance to the construction and renovation of farmland irrigation, not only to prevent floods in rural areas, but also to prevent droughts. However, in the past decade, because of the Anti-Japanese War, the areas occupied by the enemy were ravaged by the enemy, and the fields were already barren. Even in the rural areas in the rear, on the one hand, because of the lack of science, and on the other hand, because they were unable to take care of them during the war, the rural economy has also become depressed. The occurrence of this year's floods can be said to be a natural disaster, but it can also be said to be a man-made disaster, and in northern Jiangsu, which has suffered the destruction of the communist bandits, it is especially the result of a major disaster and man-made disaster!

Guangdong and Guangxi are the source of the Chinese revolution, Sichuan is the base of our country's Anti-Japanese War, and northern Jiangsu is the front line of the country's suppression of bandits and rebellion today. People across the country cannot stand idly by and watch the millions of disaster victims in the above-mentioned areas without food and clothing and nowhere to turn. Especially the citizens of our Shanghai, who have been living a normal life, should be able to empathize with these disaster victims who are waiting to be fed, take the initiative to exert themselves, and actively contribute to reduce their suffering.

Jiangsu party and government leaders and representatives of public opinion organs came to Shanghai yesterday to jointly invite the reporters of this city to report on the disaster situation in northern Jiangsu in detail, and to appeal to all sectors of Shanghai for disaster relief. How can the citizens of Shanghai remain unmoved when they hear this urgent call for help? Shanghai is the center of national industry and commerce, and the place where national wealth accumulates. There are many citizens who are happy to do good and are eager to help others. Now, the compatriots in the disaster-stricken provinces are looking forward to the citizens of Shanghai, and their emotions cannot be described in words. The citizens of Shanghai have always believed that "helping others is the source of happiness," and they will not easily give up this good opportunity to "do good and enjoy the most."

### Wang Maogong Reports on the Disaster Situation

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 14th] Wang Maogong took a special plane at 10:00 this morning to conduct an aerial survey of the floods in Pei, Xiao, and Dang. He returned to Xuzhou at 12:00 and hosted reporters at 5:00 p.m. to report on the disaster situation. The traffic between Xu, Huai, and Hai in northern Jiangsu was completely cut off by the water. 17 of the 36 counties and cities in northern Jiangsu were affected, with 30 million mu of farmland flooded and more than 9 million disaster victims. Among them, the disasters in Pixian, Xiaoxian, Donghai, Guanyun, and Shuyang were the most severe. The entire territory was submerged, and the disaster victims were in urgent need of relief. He took a night military plane to Beijing at 9:00.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 14th] According to a report from the Jiangsu government: The first detachment of the Communist bandits in the Huaihai area, in order to prevent the National Army from suppressing them, recently dug up the dike of the Chaimi River in Tangjianju, the fifth district of Shuyang. Now the northeastern townships of the district have become a swamp.

### The Situation in Palestine is Increasingly Tense, Major Conflicts Between Jews and Arabs, Jews Accuse the British of Manipulating Behind the Scenes

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 14th] After the first direct conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine in 72 hours since 1939, the Arab market in Jaffa's old city was set on fire last night by 50 Jewish youths. The border between the Jewish and Arab districts of Tel Aviv has become a no-man's land, with only police patrolling. Both Jews and Arabs know that the great conflicts between the two races in 1936-39 were similar to the current situation when they first appeared.

This conflict began on Sunday night, when several Arab youths attacked a coffee shop run by a Jew in Tel Aviv, killing five Jews. Now there are barbed wire fences between the Jewish and Arab districts of Tel Aviv and Jaffa. Last night, hundreds of Jews fled the Jewish church in Tel Aviv to prevent retaliation from the Arabs. The Jewish underground organization Irgun issued a statement last night, pointing out that the British spies and weapons manipulated the conflicts in the past 72 hours, so "the British are still the main enemy of the Jews."

### Six Senior Officials of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Accused of Group Corruption: Five Major Crimes Listed, Including Embezzlement of Supplies and Transportation Kickbacks

[Our Dispatch] Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA); Hu Keshi, Director of the Fisheries Management Office; Dong Chengdao, Director of the Finance Office; Zhan Jiechang, Director of the Procurement and Sales Office; Chen Guangyuan, Director of the Storage and Transportation Office; and Xu Shichang, Director of the General Affairs Office, have recently been secretly reported to the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office and the District Prosecutor's Office, listing five counts of corruption against Li and others. The contents are roughly as follows: (1) Embezzlement in the allocation of electric fans: The actual number allocated was only over 10,000 units, with an allocated price of 400,000 yuan per fan (the market price is about 1,000,000 yuan), while the Procurement and Sales Office reported that it had sold more than 20,000 units, embezzling more than 10,000 units. For example, the China Merchants Bureau applied to purchase 200 electric fans in a letter, but the office forced the China Merchants Bureau to change the application to 300 fans, while only 200 fans were actually allocated. The China Merchants Bureau has a record to prove this. (2) Embezzlement in the cotton-for-yarn exchange: According to regulations, 600 pounds of cotton should be exchanged for 400 pounds of yarn, but the RRA recorded 690 pounds of cotton for 400 pounds of yarn, with the extra 90 pounds being embezzled. (3) Technical embezzlement in the watering of wheat: According to regulations, 90 pounds of flour should be milled from 100 pounds of wheat, but in milling, water must be added. By adding 5 pounds of water per dan (unit of weight), 95 pounds of flour are milled from 105 pounds of wheat. This surplus of 5 pounds is also embezzled. (4) Embezzlement in transportation kickbacks: The RRA's transportation of supplies is partly contracted out to transportation companies, with kickbacks as high as 30%. With more than 2 million tons of materials transported, the total income will reach tens of billions of yuan, and this huge sum also falls into the hands of the corrupt group. (5) Deputy Director Li's extravagant lifestyle is paid for by the RRA: Li's residence at 570 Jianguo West Road (the former residence of the traitor Wang Jingwei) has all its appliances and sundry items paid for by the RRA, and the RRA also hires as many as 18 servants. Two tons of coal are used each month, supplied by the RRA, and two refrigerators for the hospital were also moved to Li's mansion this summer. Furthermore, the estimated assets of the Director of Finance amount to US$500,000, and the Director of General Affairs owns as many as three cars. The source of these enjoyments is questionable.

### Revealing the Bribery of Officials from the Import Management Committee: Altering the Date on the Delivery Order, the Case is Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation

[Our Dispatch] Chen Ruihao, manager of Baolin Import and Export Company at 330 North Sichuan Road, ordered 200 boxes of aluminum sheets from the United States last year. The goods arrived in Shanghai on March 20th of this year. Chen applied to the Import Management Committee for import, but the committee did not approve it due to restrictions. Chen had already sold the order to a certain cigarette factory. Because he could not pick up the goods on time, the buyer negotiated with Chen to return the deposit. Later, Ling Chongren, an official of the Provisional Import Management Committee, was approached for help and a bribe of 140 million yuan was offered. Ling changed the import date on the delivery order to February 22, 1946, and the committee approved it. When picking up the goods from customs, customs officials were suspicious as to why the goods were not approved the first time but were approved the second time. The investigation department used X-rays to examine the delivery order and found that the date had been altered. The aluminum sheets were seized and the above situation was notified to the Import Management Committee on suspicion of document forgery by Chen et al. The Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. In addition to the suspects Chen Ruihao and Ling Chongren, there are also related parties: Zhang Rongsheng, manager of Huatong Cigarette Factory, and Huang Xianzhi, manager of Xinhua Tobacco Company. The cabinet will summon the suspects and related parties for interrogation.

### If Dance Halls Are Banned, Social Flowers Will Abound: They Will Still Be Active in Secret, Only Reducing Tax Revenue; It is Better to Impose Restrictions Through Taxation, Achieving Two Goals at Once

New Dance Halls Will Be Banned from Next Month

[Our Dispatch] Since the "Measures for the General Mobilization Festival" stipulated the banning of commercial dance halls nationwide, people in Shanghai have a sense of "spoiling the scenery." What makes the financial authorities feel even more of a headache is that tax revenue will inevitably be hit as a result, reducing a large source of income. The city's financial revenue has always relied on "entertainment tax" as one of its main sources. Although business tax has been in first place in recent months, entertainment tax still ranks second in the city's revenue. According to statistics from the Finance Bureau: among the city's entertainment tax, dance hall revenue accounts for about 1 billion yuan, other bars and cafes with dancing facilities account for about 600 million yuan, and the entertainment tax portion of Western restaurants with dancing facilities totals nearly 2 billion yuan, accounting for 40% of the entire entertainment tax revenue.

The municipal government believes that completely banning dancing in Shanghai will not be as easy as imagined. Those who make a living from it may still be active in secret by "stealing the sky and changing the day." Therefore, some people believe that instead of banning it without stopping it, which reduces government revenue, it is better to "impose restrictions through taxation," increasing tax revenue and achieving two goals at once.

Implementing Rules Are Under Review

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, was summoned to Beijing some days ago to discuss this matter. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to Wu, the principle of banning dancing has been approved by the National Economic Commission, and the detailed implementation measures are being reviewed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Social Affairs, together with relevant agencies. However, it has been stipulated that from September 1st, no new dance halls will be allowed to be established, and the existing dance halls will be phased out. The "phased" explanation refers to giving the dancers and employees who make a living from it sufficient time and opportunity to engage in other occupations. However, this does not apply to those who bring their own dance partners to places like the Cathay Hotel's music hall.

Wu added that if commercial dance halls are banned in Shanghai, the dancers will all flow into the disguised "social flower" camp. In the future, customers bringing these kinds of girls to music cafes would be no different from changing the soup but not the medicine. In the past, dancers mostly held licenses issued by the police station, making them easier to manage. After the dance halls are abolished, this group of dancers will no longer be subject to the control of the police station, and problems will inevitably arise. Furthermore, Shanghai's environment is unique. Unlike Nanjing and Hangzhou, which have scenic mountains and rivers to enjoy, Shanghai has a larger population than other places. Due to the lack of proper entertainment, in the past many people used singing and dancing venues as good places to "enjoy the mountains and rivers." Therefore, after dancing is banned, what we must consider is how to guide them onto the path of proper entertainment.

Actual Number of Dancers is 1,700

According to a reporter's investigation, the total number of registered dancers in Shanghai is 4,822. However, many of them have dropped out of school due to the summer vacation, or have gone to Hong Kong and Qingdao to "pan for gold," or have married and changed careers. According to the police station's recent statistics, the actual number is only 1,776. However, this number will increase sharply after the autumn cools down. As for the existing dance halls in Shanghai, there are more than 20, including Da Hu, Xian Le, Gaoshi Man, Vienna, MGM, Lido, Paramount, New Xianlin, Da Du Hui, Xiao Du Hui, Lide Er, Jinshan, Far East, Yangzi, Central, Da Dong, New Du Hui, Victory, Da Lu, Da Hua, Xinhua, Gao Ju, Wei Yun, Hua Du, and Huang Gong. In addition, the total number of bars with dancers is as high as 424.

In the midst of this ban on dancing, American journalists have also shown great "interest." A reporter from the Associated Press said: "The Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau doesn't seem to be in favor of it: he has two reasons, (1) There are 20,000 people in Shanghai who rely on dancing to make a living. (2) If dancing is banned, foreign sailors will need other amusements when they come ashore."

Director Liu stated that he did not intend to approve their request before the hearing. After the hearing, if their crimes were relatively minor, both the military police and police officers could request bail. The detained military police will be brought to today's hearing to confront the witnesses from all three parties. Due to the large number of people being interrogated, the hearing will continue for two days or more, but it must be completed within this week.

At the beginning of its establishment, its purpose was, as its name suggests, to be a scientific research institution led by Yang, specializing in the production and sale of medicines, chemicals, nourishing foods, and other related products in accordance with government regulations. The purpose was to engage in scientific research, explore specialized drug manufacturing methods, and organize and operate self-reliant distribution agencies, while also engaging in the manufacture and sale of new drugs. With Yang's knowledge, experience, and ambition, as well as the foundation of the past decade, the future development will be limitless.

### Absurd Testament, Unrepentant to the End, Enemy Liyang Military Police Sergeant Tomita Toku Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday, Still Stubbornly Shouting "Tenno Heika Banzai" Before Execution

[Report from our Newspaper] Tomita Toku, a Japanese war criminal and sergeant of the Liyang Military Police, previously sentenced to death by a military tribunal, was executed by firing squad at the Shanghai Prison execution ground yesterday morning. The condemned made arrogant remarks and still shouted "Tenno Heika Banzai" before execution, unrepentant to the end, showing the deep poison of militarism. At a time when Japan is striving to rise again, this should serve as a warning to us.

Counter-insurgency specialist, brutally murdered

Tomita Toku, age 29, was from Aichi Prefecture, Japan, and was a sergeant in the Liyang Japanese Military Police. During the occupied period, there was a Liyang native named Di Weicheng, a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy, who served as the lieutenant colonel staff director of the 6th Detachment of the Loyal National Salvation Army, and the colonel training officer of the army headquarters, and also returned to his hometown with the rank of major general to serve as a counter-insurgency specialist. On the morning of March 26th, 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), Tomita Toku led a team to arrest him, using torture to force a confession, leaving him covered in injuries. Because Di refused to confess, on the night of June 4th, Di's mouth and eyes were tightly bound, and he was beaten to death, placed in a straw bag, transported to a wasteland, butchered, breaking his arms and legs, buried in a shallow grave, and his body was forbidden to be collected.

Fallen in irrigation water, slammed against wall, burned by fire

There was also Cao Ke, who was also arrested on April 1st, 34th year of the Republic of China for counter-insurgency work, and after Tomita Toku used torture to force a confession, he was knocked down in irrigation water, his shoulders were crushed, slammed against the wall, burned by fire, a stone was placed on his back, and dogs were sicced on him, but fortunately they sniffed without biting, avoiding death. However, the bone injuries have not yet healed, and the burn marks still exist. Shi Bianchen was also arrested on April 8th of the same year, beaten on the back with bamboo sticks, causing the skin to break and bleed, and threatened with irrigation and dog bites, detained for half a month, and only given two fist-sized rice balls. He was forced to drink smelly water from the gutter, and later feigned madness to escape. After the victory, Di's wife, Di Fangdexian, submitted a complaint to the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, ordering the prisoner of war management office to transfer the defendant to the military tribunal for investigation and prosecution. After the trial, the court found the defendant's crimes to be extremely brutal and sentenced him to death on April 17th. The execution has now been approved by an order from the Ministry of National Defense.

Three wills, sweat pouring

Yesterday morning, Military Tribunal Prosecutor Fu Shude, accompanied by clerk Yuan Juqing, translator Luo Di, and others, arrived at the Shanghai Prison. At 9:53, the Japanese prisoner was brought out from the prison. Tomita Toku was wearing an old yellow military uniform, and the collar insignia, etc. had been removed. He was small in stature and knew that his death was near, his face was pale. After the prosecutor asked his year and place of origin, he asked if he had any last words, and then requested to write three wills. He immediately wrote with a pencil, his heart was flustered, the pencil lead broke repeatedly, sweat poured out like pulp. When writing the third letter, he asked for a cigarette. The wording of the wills was quite absurd: (1) To the leaders and men of the Kiangwan Detention Camp: My fate will end on the morning of August 14th. I entrust my affairs to Maruyama, Noguchi, and Morishita. I wish you all good health. I wish the Imperial Army will be rebuilt and live forever. (2) Dear Wife: My fate ends today. My heart is at peace. I believe my children will follow my spirit and be reborn. My soul will always be around my mother. I hope you will uphold Japanese womanly virtues and take care of my mother. Paper is short, and my words are not exhaustive. (3) Mother, your son is unfilial, please forgive me. I am being executed today as a soldier of the Japanese Empire. Only the Emperor and the gods know my affairs. Please do not be sad and take care of your health. This paper also left a place name: Miwa Village, Chita District, Aichi Prefecture.

A loud bang, instantly dead

After writing, the prosecutor ordered the execution. At this time, Tomita was sweating profusely. The soldiers standing beside him used a towel to wipe it dry for him. His hands were tied behind his back with hemp rope, and he was taken to the execution ground. As the criminal sat on the wooden chair, he shouted "Tenno Heika Banzai" in a trembling voice. The squad leader of the military police, Ma Yushan, raised his gun, and with a loud bang, the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his mouth, blood flowed like a fountain, and he died instantly. The time was exactly 10:20 am. The corpse was covered with white cloth and taken away by Matsuoka Seiaki, on behalf of the Japanese Association.

After the execution of Tomita Toku, there is still one war criminal sentenced to death, Hanahana Taisai Hirata Shibasaburo, detained at the Shanghai Prison, whose ultimate fate is probably not far away.

### Friends of Chinese Farmers, Christian Brotherhood Group Holds Second Annual Meeting in Hangzhou

[Special Correspondent Yong Yusheng, Hangzhou, 13th] Thirty-eight agricultural technology experts from the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) held a meeting in Hangzhou starting on August 12th. These thirty-eight agricultural technology experts are all members of the American Christian Brotherhood. They do not want the remuneration from UNRRA and the CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), purely serving China's vast rural areas on a voluntary basis. Moreover, they also donate tractors, dairy cows, fertilizer, seeds, and insecticides from the United States. They truly delve into the rural areas, distributed in provinces such as Northeast China, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Although they are agricultural technology experts, they are not elegantly dressed and solemn. During the meeting, they still wore undershirts or shirts without ties, and some were barefoot, wearing shorts.

Full beard and no time to shave

Ages of twenty or thirty, but their beards are as long as Yu Youren's. The reporter was interested in their lack of grooming, and they said almost in unison: "We come from the fields, we work all day, we don't need to groom ourselves at all, and there is no time to groom ourselves, just like Chinese farmers."

At the meeting, only Sullienbazger, executive secretary of the Brotherhood Service Group and chairman of this year's meeting, smoked cigarettes, and none of the other agricultural experts smoked. At the opening ceremony on the 12th, only Sun Xiaolou, director of the Zhejiang branch of the CNRRA, and Zhang Zhongying, director of the inspection office, wore ties and neat clothes, which caused them to laugh. Sun and Zhang were a little embarrassed.

They have held a meeting in China once before, which was held in Hankou in January last year. This is already the second time. This kind of gathering is called the annual meeting, to review the achievements of serving in China and how to develop work in the future?

Sun Xiaolou, Director of the Zhejiang Branch of the CNRRA said: "Most of the Chinese people are lovely, and I want them to be closer to the farmers, so that they can seek the true will of the people." Sun Zhongying said: "China is too far away from agricultural modernization, and scientific methods must be used to improve agricultural production technology." Morgan, an agricultural expert stationed in Hangzhou at UNRRA said: "We thank the Brotherhood for their help, but we hope that they can further assist us in our work." Green, chairman of the Agricultural Rehabilitation Committee of the UNRRA Mountain Country Office, said: "I went to Henan last August, just after the big flood. Hundreds of thousands of acres of wasteland, the residents fled one after another, and there was no one in sight. It was really a barren land. I went to Henan again this July and saw that the land had been reclaimed and the seeds had been sown. This barren land has become cultivated land. This was originally done by hundreds of thousands of farmers, working hard by themselves. From this, we can see the greatness of the power of Chinese farmers and the strength of their will. When we technicians are in the wasteland, even if we have a tractor, I am afraid we will have to sigh at the land, and Chinese farmers can not be afraid of difficulties and hardships. This is really what our American people should admire. If they are given machinery within three years, then the Chinese people can cultivate the land all over the world." He believes that today's Chinese rural system does not need revolution, but technical improvement. He hopes that the brothers of the Brotherhood will work hard to help Chinese agricultural technology achieve modernization.

The agricultural technology experts of the Brotherhood are burying themselves in research to help

Chinese agricultural technology modernization

It is said that the topic of this annual meeting is to make tractors widely used in Chinese rural areas in the first step, and to make rural areas no longer use manpower to pump water in the second step, but to use machine pumping methods to irrigate fields. The third step is to enable China to manufacture fertilizer and keep seeds well preserved. As for the improvement of agricultural implements in rural areas, agricultural implement companies jointly established by the UNRRA and local officials and civilians manufacture and apply them. After the end of the UNRRA, the brothers of the Brotherhood will still stay in China for a certain period of time to help improve agricultural techniques.

Most of them are American experts in agricultural research, and these experts have not become officials, nor have they sat in offices to plan "actions" exclusively. They also don't spend their days attending cocktail parties and grand banquets, nor do they give touching speeches in elegant attire at public gatherings. However, they work side by side with farmers, and they can be said to be true experts. I hope that those of us in China who study agriculture will quickly delve into the countryside and take the American Brotherhood as a good example!

[Report from our newspaper] The "Brotherhood Service Group," which volunteers in the UNRRA, held a meeting in Hangzhou on the 12th. Cleveland, the Director of the Chinese Branch of the UNRRA, sent a telegram praising the group's spirit of work and its actual achievements. The members come from twelve provinces, using 3,590 head of livestock and 1,136 tractors, cultivated 400,000 mu of wasteland in one year, and trained 1,000 farmers who can use new farming tools.

### Qingdao Zhang Lingyun Arrested, Police Bureau Issues Mimeographed Statement, All News Industry Colleagues in the City Continue to Negotiate

[Report from our Newspaper, Qingdao, 10th] The news of the arrest of Zhang Lingyun, president of the New Life Society in this city, has been published in this newspaper. Zhang was arrested by four plainclothes police officers at 1:00 AM on June 1st. They did not show identification or orders, saying "You don't need to worry about it," and used guns to escort him onto a large truck. His wife came out to stop them and was also threatened with guns, like a kidnapping. This has aroused the public outrage of the entire journalism community. As of last night, it has been four days. The police bureau suddenly issued a mimeographed statement, which read: "Zhang Lingyun, president of the New Life Society at No. 2 Shanghai Road in this city, served as the political instructor of the Communist Bandit 5th Detachment (Lin Ruiwu's Unit) in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), using the alias Ding Guang. In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), he surrendered to the puppet regime and served as the head of the Propaganda Class of the New People's Association of the Puppet Regime in County, and as a special correspondent for the Puppet New People's Daily. This has been confirmed by the Ludong Anti-Japanese Comrades Friendship Association and the County Government of County. This bureau has been ordered by the superiors to carry out the investigation and arrest, and on the morning of the 6th of this month, we arrested Zhang Lingyun and transferred him to the court for trial in accordance with the law today (9th)." At 10:00 PM tonight, a mimeographed statement supplement was issued, the original text of which read: "Investigating special criminal cases is complicated and intricate, and investigation takes time. There are clear provisions in the law that they cannot be subject to the 24-hour detention like ordinary cases. After the Zhang case occurred, outsiders did not understand the truth, and even fabricated stories, saying that this bureau inflicted physical punishment, which has been denied by Mr. Zhang himself and can be said to be self-defeating. In short, this bureau acts impartially and only follows the law."

The newspaper industry has many doubts about this statement: Why is cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resist Japan in the 27th year (1938) now considered a crime, especially since Zhang did not join the Communist Bandit? As for traitor cases, they should be handled by the court, and according to the Special Criminal Procedure Regulations, there is no article that states "not subject to 24-hour detention." That night, after inquiring with the court, the Zhang case had not been transferred to the court, and Zhang had not been questioned at all during the four days he was detained. The newspaper industry has expressed dissatisfaction with all these points. In particular, the Military-Civilian Daily and the Qingdao Daily have protested the most vigorously.

All newspapers in the city have unanimously stated that if negotiations are ineffective, they will not hesitate to use a city-wide newspaper strike to deal with the situation.

On the 8th, the police bureau armed Zhang and escorted him to the garrison headquarters. The garrison department also received this secret report and conducted an investigation, and all the details were false and not accepted. The police bureau has now become a situation where it is riding a tiger and cannot get off. As of press time, Zhang is still being held at the police station.

### Zhejiang Second Phase of Water Conservancy Project, Surveying Work Has Begun

[Report from our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th] The first phase of the water conservancy project in Zhejiang Province has been largely completed, and the water conservancy project offices in various counties have been closed one after another. Those that have not been completed will be handled by the Water Conservancy Council. All projects must be completed by the end of August. The surveying of the second phase of the project has also begun one after another.

[Report from our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th] The Water Conservancy Commission previously stated that China could have US$500 million for water conservancy rehabilitation matters, and ordered the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau to formulate a construction plan based on the needs of the province. Now the plan has been completed, requiring US$50 million, which is worth 200 million yuan in the former legal currency, including flood control, farmland irrigation and other water conservancy projects. If this plan is realized, the agriculture of Zhejiang Province can reach the level of modernization.

[Report from our Newspaper, Shaoxing, 12th] Director Sun of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau came to Shaoxing on the 12th of this month in order to urge the completion of various projects as soon as possible, and then went to the Cao'e Project Office, and ordered them to speed up the construction.

### Chief of Staff Li of the 74th Division Talks About the Story of Subordinates' False Surrender

[Report from our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] After visiting Division Commander Qiu in County, he also introduced Chief of Staff General Li Renjun to meet the reporter. General Li was an old cadre of the 74th Division. He was not tall. He was a quiet staff officer. After a brief greeting with the reporter, he happily told the reporter: "In the Battle of Tengxian, officers and soldiers of the 74th Division who were captured in Menglianggu

Those who came to this division with their guns number over a thousand." This excellent news was truly an unexpected gain for the reporter. The reporter asked, "How did they act?" Chief of Staff Li said: "According to a soldier who returned, they were collectively captured by the Communist Bandit in a dead corner of Menglianggu. Under the circumstances at the time, death was imminent if they did not surrender. In order to preserve the vitality of the 74th Division, a company commander secretly informed us that we should temporarily pretend to 'surrender'. Furthermore, after being captured, they originally monitored us extremely closely, but later, due to our clever words and flattery, we deceived the bandit army and returned our guns and ammunition, ordering us to 'fight' with the bandit army. In fact, we have secretly maintained unity at all times. He has forced us to the front line several times. How can we bear to fight our own people? When the bandit army left us, we naturally fired into the sky, but sometimes we couldn't do that. In this Battle of Tengxian, the main force of the Communist Bandit was largely transferred here for reinforcements. In order to avenge the martyrs of the 74th Division and to quell the bandit rebellion, we could no longer endure it. On a dark night, the machine guns were turned around and the muzzles were turned towards the bandit camp. We planned to kill the thieves. We planned to withdraw. This is how we mixed and killed for five hours. By the time the bandit army knew to pursue, we had already retreated into a safe area and made contact with the National Army. This sacred false 'surrender' can achieve such a strategic effect, which is rare." (Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua)

Zhang Wanfeng was used as a blood sacrifice, and the ancestral hall was opened. He was bound in front of the spirits of those who died in battle in the ancestral hall to feed the spirits with blood. The corpse meat was cut into pieces and devoured by the shaving team. Afterwards, only a head and both feet were left of Zhang Yandong. Previously, the provincial government, seeing that the custom of fighting in the province was very popular, was deeply afraid that local bullies would use this as a basis for separatism, and specially ordered all counties: All strong men who participated in the fighting will be drafted into military service. In addition to sending a telegram from the chief of police and security to the first battalion stationed in the local area to rush to put out the fire, Director Gong Jianxun went to deal with it in person on the 2nd of this month. When he arrived in the area, it was as if he had entered a battlefield. Traffic was cut off and bullets rained down. Gong thought that solving it by force would inevitably lead to more bloodshed, so he found Zhang Yuzhong in Xigang and Luo Ziqiang in Meixi, and formulated a three-chapter law: (1) All military weapons on both sides must be reported and handed over before the 14th of this month. (2) From now on, both sides will stop fighting and restore normal public security. (3) Those who kill will die, and the principals Luo Da Wan and others must be handed over.

It is said that in addition to surrendering heavy machine guns and more than 40 guns, the rest will be dealt with by the judicial organs.

[Report from our Newspaper, Anqing, 9th] A shooting case with a rather suspicious nature occurred today in Yujiayuan outside the western suburbs of the city. The deceased was only known to be surnamed Lin, and his name and origin were unknown, because he had just moved into Yujiayuan's large house and lived there for only a month, and had not registered his household. The details of the bloody case were learned as follows: At about 5:00 AM on the 9th, when the sky was just beginning to dawn, someone knocked on the door of Yujia's large house very urgently. Lin and the landlord, surnamed Yu, were both awakened from their sleep. Vaguely, they heard the voices of seven or eight people, only one of whom spoke with an Anqing accent. Lin knew something was wrong, so he hurriedly got up and ran into the courtyard. Seeing that there was no place to hide in the courtyard, he wanted to take refuge in Yu's bedroom. However, the seven or eight plainclothes men outside the door had already broken into the door. They caught sight of Lin and fired a shot, hitting his leg. Lin still ran into Yu's room with the bullet. The plainclothes men followed and fired another shot, hitting a vital spot. Lin immediately fell to the ground and died.

Zhou Jiaqi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sports Association, was present as an observer, and the meeting was chaired by Zhao Minheng, with Jiang Huaiqing as the recorder. The chairman first reported on the purpose of organizing the league and expressed gratitude for the enthusiastic participation of the teams. After discussing various issues, the following points were agreed upon:

Resolutions by Team Representatives

(1) Based on the league schedule, each group was to play three sets. Someone proposed that the number of sets be reduced to two due to insufficient court availability and time. After discussion, the majority voted to maintain the three-set system, with all matches starting at 4:00 PM.

(2) Sha Peng of the Sports Games team proposed that, according to tennis rules, there should be no draws. The current rule of stopping the third set at 6-6 and counting it as half a point for each side is inappropriate and should be resolved by public vote. It was resolved that the third set would be played until one side reaches six games.

(3) Due to court constraints, the five groups cannot play simultaneously. It was resolved that if only two courts are available, Groups 1 and 2 should play first, and both teams must arrive by 4:15 PM at the latest. If three courts are available, Groups 1, 2, and 3 should play first. The same time limit applies. However, this does not apply if both parties agree to start Groups 4 and 5 earlier.

(4) The regulations stipulate four types of balls. Someone proposed increasing the types of balls. It was resolved that there are many types of tennis balls and it is impossible to list them all. Any brand of ball that is airtight can be used. The home team should provide five cans of new balls for each match.

In addition, Chairman Zhao Minheng announced that if it is absolutely necessary to reschedule a match according to the schedule, both parties may agree to do so, but there is a limit to the rescheduling. Matches scheduled for Sunday should be rescheduled for Monday or Tuesday, and matches scheduled for Wednesday should be rescheduled for Thursday, Friday, or Saturday to avoid affecting the next schedule.

Regarding prizes, in addition to what is stipulated in the regulations, the committee decided to award an honorary prize to any group whose members have not changed and have never lost a set in the three-set, two-win system.

### Municipal Education Expenditure for the 37th Year Estimated to Require Approximately 300 Billion; The Municipal Education Bureau is Preparing the Budget.

[Our Dispatch] With the Municipal Council meeting approaching, various bureaus and departments of the municipal government are preparing the budget for the 37th year.

### Striving for International Markets and Promoting Foreign Trade: China Trust Buys Tung Oil and Bristles; Merchants Present Opinions, Hoping the Authorities Will Improve.

Since the Central Trust Bureau began acting as the government's agent for purchasing export goods, its implementation has been extremely smooth. To date, it has reached a total of 5,000 tons of tung oil, including 2,000 tons purchased in this city and approximately 2,000 tons purchased in Changsha, Hankou, Chongqing, and other places. Within the 5,000 tons, the Zhongzhi Oil Factory alone accounts for 1,970 tons, including 870 tons in this city, 450 tons in Hankou, 100 tons in Chongqing, 250 tons in Wuzhou, and 200 tons in Guangzhou. To promote the government subsidy system, the China Trust Bureau hands over the purchased goods to merchants for export and sale. To strive for the European market, it has sold 1,000 tons to the UK and various parts of mainland Europe at a price of 177 pounds per ton. It is currently observing the US market due to price concerns. However, according to the opinions of tung oil manufacturers: (1) The current purchase price of 630,000 yuan per shi is considered too low. After selling, it is impossible to replenish from the producing areas. Because merchants still have to pay interest, exchange water, transportation, and leakage expenses, a reasonable price should be above 700,000 yuan per shi. (2) The full payment date, which is no less than one week, is also too slow. Time is a significant cost for merchants, and it is hoped that the bureau will consider shortening it. (3) The reason for the slow export of purchased goods is that the price is slightly higher, making promotion difficult. If the authorities adopt market prices and make adjustments, overseas sales could be revitalized. The method for purchasing hog bristles has also changed. It is understood that in the past, the bristles were purchased from bristle merchants, and then exporters would sell them abroad on consignment. Now, it has been changed to exporters selling abroad first, and then purchasing. The bristle industry has no objection to supporting the government's policy. However, (1) the 2% commission fee is considered too low. Because exporters have to pay a 2% commission fee when selling in overseas markets, their own expenses for telegrams, paper, and labor are not covered, so they request an increase in the commission fee to 4% to avoid losses. (2) Overseas prices fluctuate from time to time. The export price set by the Central Trust Bureau also has to be decided after a meeting, which often cannot cope with the changes in overseas markets. If there is a downward trend in overseas markets, it is impossible to close the deal after the meeting. It is recommended to adopt a flexible approach to avoid missing opportunities. (3) The price for purchasing is returned and delayed, and it takes more than ten days to receive the money, which should also be improved. (4) Purchasing is a national policy, and it is difficult for the Central Trust Bureau to handle this heavy task alone. Other institutions should be designated to handle it at the same time according to the regulations. The bristle industry believes that the above points are of great importance to international trade and hopes that the government will consider them.

### Silk Weaving Industry Representatives Went to Beijing Yesterday to Request a Reduction in the Price of Rayon Allocation; No One Applied for Goods Allocated by China Trust Bureau Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Cai Xintao, Liu Qingyi, and other representatives from the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association, a total of 16 people, went to Beijing by car in two batches yesterday to request a reduction in the price of rayon allocation and to improve the allocation method. It is said that they will petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other agencies.

Another report: According to Cai and Liu before their departure yesterday, after Mayor Wu intervened in the mediation, the Central Trust Bureau has agreed to reduce the new allocation price by 20%, and is now asking the Executive Yuan for instructions. However, Mayor Wu proposed to allocate silk at a ratio of 7 for black market price and 5 for allocation price, that is, to sell at 70% of the new allocation price. As for their mission to petition in Beijing, it is to ask the authorities to improve the silk allocation method and set up a silk allocation committee, among four other demands.

Another report: It is learned that the Central Trust Bureau's agency for selling rayon for the weaving belt industry held its 19th allocation yesterday, but no one from the industry went to apply for purchase. It is said that the association has not allocated rayon for two weeks, including this time.

Rayon Price Rises

Another report: Because the allocation price of rayon has not yet been opened by the bureau, the market holders in the city seized the opportunity to raise prices again yesterday, up more than 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. Gaoshan Youguang No. 120 first called for 5.2 million yuan in the morning, bought in at 5 million yuan, and rose to 5.4 million yuan for the selling price at noon, and continued to rise in the afternoon, finally calling for 6 million yuan, but the transactions were very sparse.

Factory-Spun Yarn Rose Slightly

The medium-grade price was 26.5 million to 27.5 million yuan, and the high-grade price was 27.5 million to 28.5 million yuan. Dried-seasoned yarn was quite sluggish, and the asking price did not change.

### Relatively Firm National Bonds, Rising Foreign Stocks

Paper industry Xiangtai rose by half a percent, shipping slightly increased, and telephone stocks remained flat.

### Resurgence of Buying Interest in Chinese Stocks, Most Closing at High Prices

As a result, all stocks, except for underwear, were popular and closed at high prices.

Stabilization of the Tea Market

As for prices, because the quality of goods varies more than before, there have been changes in each category, but in reality, it is still in a state of stalemate. As for the foreign trade tea market, the situation of quietness for many days has not yet been broken. Because a month ago, the French company Yongxing Yanghang finalized a deal with Morocco for 900 tons of Zhenmei tea, the local export merchants are now busy with shipping as the shipping date is approaching, and they have no time to take care of other matters. It is learned that the French company Yongxing Yanghang plans to continue to promote green tea such as Zhenmei in that area, and it is said that they will soon send a telegram overseas to solicit business.

### Silk Spinning Team Decides to Adjust Price Negotiation for 20-Count Yarn to 9.7 Million Yuan Per Piece

[Our Newspaper] The Silk Spinning Price Negotiation Team convened a meeting yesterday afternoon. As a result, it was decided to adjust the price negotiation for 20-count yarn to 9.7 million yuan per piece, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to Monday's negotiation. The price negotiations for other counts of yarn remain unchanged.

Continued Firmness of Yarn Prices

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to show an upward trend, with the market prices having fallen significantly for days, and buyers taking advantage of the low prices to make purchases. There were also movements in the local market, with rumors of favorable buying circulating in the market.

By the end of the day, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn continued to rise by 760,000 yuan from the previous day, to 16.8 million yuan. 20-count Extra Double Horse yarn rose sharply to 11.5 million yuan, and Light Double Horse also rose to 10.2 million yuan, both up 500,000 yuan. 16-count Coarse Yarn Guangming also rose by 550,000, to 9.1 million yuan, and Hailong rose by 500,000, to 8.4 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn all continued to rise by varying amounts, ranging from 100,000 to 450,000 yuan.

Slight Increase in Cotton Cloth

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially saw scattered sellers offering goods. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once fell to a low of 395,000 yuan. However, due to large buyers taking advantage of the low prices to absorb supply, and various parties also making moves, about 100 pieces were traded. It was also rumored that the Hong Kong dollar was depreciating, and floating capital might shift to the Shanghai market, causing buying sentiment in the market to become even stronger. Due to insufficient stock, Dragon Head fine cloth slightly rose from a low price to 424,000 yuan, and then there was some profit-taking and selling, pulling the price back slightly, and finally closed at 410,000 yuan, a continued increase of 5,000 yuan from the previous day. After the close, the outside market price was as high as 415,000 yuan, with buyers still interested.

Fine cloths of various grades, such as Wufu, Caiqiu, Lanji, Yanghe, and Zhenzhong, also rose by 2,000 to 5,000 yuan. The remaining white fabric, bleached fabric, and yuan fabric, fine twill, Shilin cloth, and other popular items rose by 3,000 to 20,000 yuan. Straight tribute silk, yuan twill, blue cloth, and coarse cloth showed a fluctuating trend.

Textile Construction Sells Cloth

It is also reported that China Textile Construction Corporation sold cloth as usual yesterday. As the yarn and cloth market turned popular, the number of applicants was very enthusiastic. As a result, a total of 28,600 bolts of cloth were sold, with a total of 884 applications, including 16 domestic manufacturers, purchasing 640 bolts of cloth, and 868 cloth merchants purchasing 27,960 bolts of cloth.

### Continued Stability of Cotton Market

Yesterday, the spot cotton market turned firmer and the trend stabilized. Buyers' appetite increased due to the continued strength of cotton yarn, and local yarn factories showed considerable interest. However, as the new cotton season was approaching and new goods were expected to flood the market, sellers were unwilling to raise prices, and many transactions were shelved. The prices offered by various firms for delivery to factories were: Baoer 2.05 million, Shashi 1.98 million, Hankou fine velvet 1.94 million, Lingbao, delivered at the pier, 2 million, 2.02 million, Zhoupu seed cotton 290,000.

### Liquidation Work of Bachuan and Zhenghe Banks Proceeding Smoothly

[Our Newspaper] Li Lixia, Chief of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, answered four questions from reporters yesterday, which are recorded as follows: (1) The liquidation of Bachuan and Zhenghe Banks is currently proceeding smoothly and will be completed in the short term. (2) The Shanghai branches of the two banks have had their licenses revoked by the Ministry of Finance, so there is no hope of resumption of business. (3) The National Bank's inspection of the general operations of banks and firms continues as usual. If any abnormal operations are found, they will be immediately reported to the Ministry of Finance for handling. The results will only be announced after the Ministry of Finance decides on the handling methods. (4) The recent easing of credit is likely a natural cycle following the previous tight credit conditions and is unrelated to the management of general banking obligations. The recent clearing of checks is quite normal, which is sufficient to prove that the financial sector is quite peaceful.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation, Nine Years of Peaceful Coexistence, Sudden Discord and Legal Battle

Dear Editor: I have lived in a living room in a certain alley for nine years with the sub-landlord Mr. Yuan. Recently, I was suddenly sued in court by him for "business needs" and the reason of increased population, requesting me to move out and asking for permission to execute the order. Now I have several questions and hope to get your answers. (1) Mr. Yuan's family has a total of six people, living in eight rooms of the house. In fact, the space is quite spacious. Can the house be taken back on the grounds of "business needs?" (2) Mr. Yuan now reports a total of fifteen people including his collateral relatives. Can this be a legitimate reason for taking back the house? (3) Mr. Yuan has repeatedly increased the rent, and I have not been able to afford it, so he has harbored resentment. Now he is forcing me to move out. Is this also the main reason? Is this reasonable in law? (4) Now I am unable to move out and refuse Mr. Yuan's request. What legal protection do I have? Sincerely, Sun Siru

[Attorney He Kuang] (1) Whether the number of his family members is large and whether the eight rooms they occupy are insufficient can be proved by asking the court to access the household registration book of the household. (2) Whether his collateral relatives have moved in can also be ascertained from the household registration book. (3) Forcing a tenant to move out because of failure to increase the rent is unjustified. (4) If the tenant has not violated any of the provisions listed in Article 100 of the Land Law, the landlord shall not claim to take back the house without reason.

### Reading "Philosophy of the New World"

— Meng Kun

Written by Zhang Xinyi, Published by Kaiming Bookstore

This recently published book discussing philosophical issues uses the most accessible method of narration, not only discussing some topics that are traditionally considered to belong to the realm of philosophy, but also involving many other social, natural, life, living, and cosmic, international aspects. As the title of the book suggests, this is a book studying the philosophy of the "New World," so the author, from his point of view, expands philosophy into an all-encompassing program, and then analyzes the laws and systems of each "New World."

Living in our era, the need for knowledge is more urgent for people than in any previous historical period. Philosophy, which was originally the study of a few specialized talents, is now of concern to the general public. Our publishing industry has also published many philosophical books in the past, but they are all academic classics for scholars to seek truth, and are not used to help the general public understand the truth of this world. This book provides some common-sense philosophical knowledge, which is practical and indispensable for people who are citizens of a new world.

This book may be considered a practical philosophy, but it is still distant from the so-called philosophy of life in the secular sense. Its scope is broader, touching on every abstract question that exists in a century. Rather than saying that this book is an introduction to philosophical common sense, it is better to say that it is an introduction to the common sense of the era. It gives readers a clear world view and social view. From a browse of this book, we can see how we human beings live in this time and space, and how we will live on. Understanding what the era is, what major problems our era has, we then understand what kind of life criteria individuals should adopt, go to the future, build a new culture, and create a new civilization.

The entire article is about 150,000 words in length, divided into two parts. The first part, "Ethical System," focuses on some basic concepts and basic principles of life; the second part, "Deduction and Problems," is an extension of the first part, moving from abstract to concrete, discussing various actual and complex problems.

The first chapter of the first part proposes the basic responsibility of our era, which is how to eliminate human suffering and further cultivate the flowers and fruits of happiness. The author uses the painful memories of World War II as a warning and shouts out the slogan of "transforming thought." Although this has some preaching flavor, it can be seen that the author is a sincere admirer of humanism and not a whimsical figure, combined with the author's utilitarianism and some of the aspirations for social reconstruction in the final paragraph. Based on this premise, the author's thoughts spread out, and after revealing the root of the world's chaos, he then discusses issues such as "the universe and events," "categories and causes," "purpose and means," and "this virtue." After this, there are four chapters arranged side by side, first discussing people's good and bad, the value of life, happiness, and happiness; then discussing the good and bad of the public, thus contrasting the importance and relationship between people and society; then discussing the question of right and wrong, what is truth, what is objective absolute right and wrong; and finally discussing good and evil, criticizing a person's behavior and knowledge; these discussions all lead to the wellspring of morality, and integrate the ethical theories of various schools of thought in China and the West.

The following section then discusses some of the "biggest and most fundamental" practical problems based on the above theory. The first is the outlook on life, "People are born into the world to work together to turn our universe into the best universe"; the outlook on work, "Any profession is to be loyal to one's duty in the universe"; the other is to say that the spirit of the era lies in moving from the pursuit of the welfare of a few to the pursuit of the welfare of the majority. Finally, seven major problems in the world are extracted: the first is the national view, the author praises universal love, hopes for great harmony, sings the praises of righteous diplomacy, and dreams of abolishing the colonial system. The second is the economic view, discussing material enjoyment and the distribution of enjoyment, but also discussing the population problem. The third discusses democracy, the fourth discusses moral issues. The fifth discusses religion, the sixth discusses philosophy, and the seventh discusses science. He very rationally and freely reveals his faith in the new world.

Overall, this book is very accessible in form and very practical in content. The author widely adopts the existing theories of various scholars, but it is not boring. Not many technical terms are used, the explanations are thorough, the sentences are simple, and examples are abundant. At the same time, it adopts a new organization, appropriately interweaving the original philosophical life problems with the new world dynamics, without seeing any patchworks. Furthermore, the author takes every problem that fits the daily life of modern human beings as his object. Every problem is closely related to our existence in this world. Once we accept them, we will see more clearly the time and space in which we are located.

### The Little Dough Man Seeks Immortality

— Jie Hang

(Published by Hope Society)

"The Little Dough Man Seeks Immortality," purely from the perspective of the book itself, is not a bad one. However, from the perspective of the author's ambition, or the purpose that the author himself hopes for, it is not the best book. The author says at the beginning of the book that it is given to "my little daughter who is far away from me and all the children who are far away from their parents." What the book describes is the various difficulties encountered by the Little Dough Man on his journey to seek immortality in order to truly become a person. Therefore, the sequel to this book should not be the young masters and young ladies who are causing trouble in the ivory tower because they have eaten too much milk and have indigestion, but rather those children who are going to suffer the misfortune of being "far away from their parents." However, there are many images and words in this book that these children cannot understand, which may be what should be criticized. Like: "It seems that someone is gently pulling the Huai E-ling," "walking with Chaplin-like steps," "By-By By-By," and "Ha". Can those "children who are far away from their parents" know what "Huai E-ling," "Chaplin," "By-By," and "Ha" are? These places should be replaced with more accessible images and words. For example, "Happy as if he got a hundred points" This "as if" is very inappropriate, because we no longer need to cultivate the concept of children regarding scores as life.

In addition, the author has neglected one point. The four dangers encountered by the Little Dough Man, except for the fox, do not have detailed character descriptions. However, the author's description of the rabbit is very successfully original: the rabbit dreams that the Lion King said to him, "You have two long ears, you should hear everything... It doesn't matter if you move a little bit of right and wrong." It is different from the imitation of old fairy tales by the fox, dog, and scorpion. Originality is especially important in China, where there are few children's books.

The good things about this book should be the following points:

The first is in terms of the technique of giving metaphors. Like the dog said to the Little Dough Man:

"Welcome to my door

(It points to its mouth),

Come to my house and rest your legs,

(It patted its belly)."

Using this form is clearer and easier for young readers to accept.

The second is that the innocence of the Little Dough Man is expressed very successfully in the dialogue without using an adjective. Like the Little Dough Man said:

"Why are you drooling and staring at me? The book is not shy!" "Oh, oh, oh, I'm going to cry!"

Third, the fragrant knots of this fairy tale poem have reached the highest level, harmonious and natural.

In short, although this book is mixed with cleverness and clumsiness, it is still a children's book that can be read in China today.

### Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese Celebrities

— Zong Hao

Edited by Ren Jiayao, Published by Dongfang Bookstore

In recent years, the changes in domestic personnel have been numerous and complicated, often making it difficult for people to find out the key. Especially in the process of the eight years of the War of Resistance and the two years of victory and restoration, the overall situation has been turbulent and unstable, and personnel changes have been ever-changing. If you want to understand the current affairs, you must start with these numerous news figures.

In China's pitiful publishing industry, it seems that no one has started editing a dictionary of contemporary Chinese celebrities in the past decade. For newspaper readers, to "know people and discuss things" and explore the cause and effect of facts from the ideological background of the parties involved, it is very difficult because of the lack of such dictionaries, and it is extremely painful for young people who are eager to learn.

Now, the "Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese Celebrities" edited by Ren Jiayao has been published. Although it cannot be said to be all-encompassing and describe the life of every important person in the country in detail, it does have a clear and concise outline, allowing readers to have a general understanding of figures in the political, military, industrial, academic and other fields in the country. It lets people know the year of birth, native place, alias, background, experience, works, current position and other main items of each contemporary person. The order of arrangement is based on the number of strokes in the name, making it quite convenient to check.

Looking at the whole book, its final revision should be the stage when the government was reorganized, so the backbone of the Youth Party of China and the Democratic Socialist Party of China were also added. The book contains about 1,500 to 1,600 celebrities. In terms of quantity, it is indeed not complete and detailed enough, and because of the lack of photos, it is not eye-catching to read. However, if we treat it as a reference for reading newspapers and use it as a basis for understanding news and "knowing people and discussing things," it is still a reference book with considerable value and content.

### A Brief Discussion of Biological Evolution

— Dongyuan

(Written by Zhou Jianren, Life Edition, Price: 7,000 Yuan)

Living things are evolving. According to V. Kellogg's explanation of the meaning of "evolution":

"Evolution means continuity, transformation, from the old arising the new; it is change, continuous movement, and gradual development. It means a system of interrelationship, affinity of lineage, a comprehensive system encompassing all living things. It means the fundamental unity of all living things, yet the appearances and behaviors of each kind and each individual vary. Evolution is a continuous stream of life, expressed differently in different parts, but actually never cut off."

Indeed, "evolution is a continuous stream of life," and humanity has unfolded a fierce struggle for progress on this path!

In recent years, several translations of works on "evolutionary theory" have been published, but their difficult language makes them inaccessible to the general public, such as Darwin's "The Origin of Species." Consequently, many intellectuals, although aware of the word "evolution," remain unclear about its true meaning.

Mr. Zhou Jianren's recent book, "A Brief Discussion of Biological Evolution," fills the above gap. This is an original work, and its writing does not have the dry and difficult tone of translated works. Instead, it is accessible to the average reader.

The author's tone in this book is more popular and concise than in his other works, because it is aimed at the general youth—for young people to use for self-study. In terms of content, it provides an overview of the theory of biological evolution.

First, he explains what is meant by "evolution"? He clearly states the meaning of "evolution," and objectively describes the different translations of "evolution" by different schools.

Next, he discusses the richness of the biological world, the connections within the biological world, the development of organisms, and their changes and the "causes" of these changes. These aspects are described concisely and accurately. After reading, one will definitely have a general understanding of the evolution and transformation of organisms.

Later, the author also explains instinct and its origin, the origin of mankind, and language and writing. From ancient times to the present, the author presents it all clearly in a concise style.

After reading these articles, one can understand the various meanings of biological evolution, especially for young people, who can add a lot of necessary knowledge.

Generally speaking, this book is of a sufficient standard, especially since this type of book is hard to find in the publishing industry. It is also a contribution to the publishing industry.

### On New Art

— Wen Zhaotong

Written by Cai Yi, Published by Commercial Press

This kind of book is one that solves the question of "What is art?" This "On New Art" is no exception.

The whole book is divided into eight chapters, totaling 192 pages, and is in a 32mo format. It was first published in Chongqing in July of the 32nd year, reprinted in December of the following year, and first published in Shanghai in the 35th year. Recently, it has been included in the "Middle School Student's Library."

In the first chapter, "Introduction," the relationship between art and reality and science is explained. The differences between art and science in terms of understanding are distinguished. The understanding of art is sensory, and the understanding of science is intellectual. The former is figurative, and the latter is logical. The author also affirms: art is the expression of the recognition of reality, and this expression requires skilled technique, but not technique acquired through repeated identical or similar behaviors. Rather, it requires, as a prerequisite, the ability to express the essence of reality, to recognize typical images.

Recognition is the beginning of artistic creation, and completion is expression. The second and third chapters examine this aspect in detail. First, from the two major divisions of philosophy—idealism and materialism—it is explained what constitutes recognition. The author affirms: "Sensation is the basis of recognition, and the external objects of reality are the source of sensation, and without external objects of reality, there is no consciousness at all, and all recognition is a reflection of reality." (p. 29) And art is an expression of recognition. He opposes theories of inspiration and theories of genius, asserting: "Art is not a revelation of the subconscious, nor is it the result of fantasy, that is to say, it is not beyond reality, not isolated from reality, but a reflection of objective reality, that is, an understanding of objective reality by the author." (p. 32) What is the nature of recognition? It is mainly to reflect the general in the particular of objective reality through intellect and then return to the senses. At the same time, practice is the trigger for the author's recognition of objective reality, and it must also be a dynamic and conscious recognition. The content of artistic recognition is the image that reflects the general in the particular of objective reality, which is the typical creation of art.

So-called expression is the tracing of recognition, and recognition can also be said to be the source of expression. But in examining the relationship between artistic expression and propaganda, in terms of the author and the work: it is the expression of self-recognition, the creation of self-completion. In terms of society: it is the communication to others; the former is the artistic quality of art, and the latter is the propaganda quality of art, both of which must be based on artistic quality and unified in the completed art. The higher the artistic quality, the greater the propaganda quality; the lower the artistic quality, the smaller the propaganda quality, so artistic quality is the first priority.

Artistic expression requires technique, but technique cannot exist independently apart from other conditions of artistic creation. There are three main conditions for technique: first, familiarity with the constituent laws of the object of expression; second, familiarity with the influence of subjective spirit on the object; third, familiarity with the special properties of the tools of expression. The consistent relationship between these three is the supreme method of artistic expression.

The fourth chapter explains the content and form of art. The author believes that in art, "recognition is the content, expression is its form, the content determines the form, but the form is also an essential, dynamic element for art. It has its own uniqueness and can act on the content in turn to further demand the unity of content and form."

The foundation of the subjectivity of art is individuality, and from a class-based point of view, it is the class nature of consciousness; objectivity is the essence or truth of objective reality reflected through the consciousness of the author, which is the core of the content of art. Thus, objective reality has historical nature, and the art that reflects it has a sense of the times. Demanding the sense of the times in art expresses its permanence, and to pursue permanence, one must grasp the sense of the times.

Art is the expression of the recognition of reality, and what is expressed? It expresses the typical under the premise of related attributes—the content, form, subjectivity, objectivity, individuality, class nature, sense of the times, and permanence of art—and expression is description. The fifth and sixth chapters of this book examine these two aspects.

The typical is the artistic image that embodies the general in the particular, and it is also the core of art. Thus, artistic creation is the creation of the typical. To achieve the typical in art, there must be a typical in reality, but the typical in art is not a reproduction of reality or the typical reality, but an expansion and deepening of its typicality. It achieves the creation of typical characters and the grasp of typical situations. The positive and negative multifacetedness of the typical does not necessarily destroy the typicality, but can strengthen it.

The description of the typical should mainly appeal to the senses. This is concrete expression, while the intellectual is abstract expression. However, being too concrete can lead to triviality or failure to grasp the essentials. Furthermore, overemphasizing the expression of the subjective spirit through external images, or taking the development of the special properties of tools as the key to artistic creation—this kind of centerlessness and isolated technique is centrifugal description. The author asserts that it is not the main method of expression in art. On the contrary, centripetal description is the most reasonable and the description that creates the typical.

The seventh chapter, "Realism," can be said to be an examination of the path of current artistic creation. The author first explains that art of realism is the creation of artistic beauty outside of objective reality, based on idealistic philosophy. Art of realism takes objective reality as its content, and form is also determined by content, based on materialistic philosophy. Secondly, from the historical development perspective, the author examines the four stages of the development of realism, and particularly points out the fundamental differences between new realism and old realism, and further points out its creative method and world view. These two things "are inseparable, but not the same; there are differences, but not contradictions. A correct world view, applied to the field of art, can become a correct artistic thought that guides artistic creation, and a correct creative method can also help the artist's correct world view to form and develop." (p. 172)

Finally, the author examines the aesthetic problems of "the beauty of art and the evaluation of art" from the perspective of new realism. He asserts that the truth of art and the beauty of art are related and dependent on the typicality of art. He further points out: "Truth is concrete description. The more centripetal the description, the more the typical is based on objective reality, and the more advanced the typical, the higher the artistic quality of the work, and at the same time, the greater its propaganda quality, that is, the more it possesses the truth of art, the more it possesses the beauty of art, and the more valuable the work." (p. 192)
