### On the New Foreign Exchange Regulations: Hoping for National Cooperation; Speeches by Governor Zhang and Vice Minister Xu

Governor Zhang made a brief explanation at yesterday's press conference, stating: The revision of the import/export foreign exchange settlement methods was first carefully discussed by the National Economic Council, then, on the 15th, it was presented to the State Council meeting and passed in principle. On the 16th, the Executive Yuan's Review Committee revised all relevant detailed rules, and it was only now that all relevant regulations were completed and publicly announced. He concluded by saying: Currently, every country is experiencing economic panic. It is only through the cooperation of the people that a way can be found to overcome difficulties. Our country is in a difficult situation, and it is impossible to formulate any perfect solution. However, the implementation of the measures depends on the cooperation of the entire nation to achieve success. My other opinions are detailed in my written statement, which I will not repeat here. Furthermore, foreign exchange policy is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, so I have specially invited Vice Minister Xu from the Ministry of Finance to attend and give a speech. Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan then delivered a written statement on behalf of Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun and announced the order of the nine documents. Finally, he stated the Ministry of Finance's position on this revision of the import/export foreign exchange settlement methods, hoping that the press would offer more guidance and support for the new measures. The success or failure of the new measures is not solely the responsibility of the government or the Central Bank, but depends on the cooperation of the entire society, especially the cooperation of the media, so as to maximize the effectiveness of the new measures.

### Five Categories of Imported Goods Approved for Settlement at the Official Exchange Rate

The names of the imported goods approved by the Executive Yuan to be settled at the official exchange rate are as follows: (1) Cotton; (2) Rice, Wheat; (3) Flour; (4) Coal; (5) Coke.

### Key Points of the Central Bank's Proposal

The key points of the Central Bank's proposal to revise the import/export foreign exchange settlement methods are as follows:

Since the official exchange rate was revised on February 17 of this year, prices have continued to rise, resulting in a significant disparity between the exchange rate and prices. Most of the imported goods settled at the official exchange rate are still sold at market prices, giving merchants extra profits without helping to stabilize prices. In terms of export trade, due to the limitations of the official exchange rate, there is no profit to be made from foreign sales, which is almost at a standstill and there is a risk that overseas markets will be taken over by others. Remittances from overseas Chinese are also evading due to the large difference between the official exchange rate and the market price, which has a significant and far-reaching impact on the balance of international payments and the national economy and people's livelihoods. The main condition of this method should be to reduce the exchange of foreign exchange in the black market. Therefore, smuggling of imports, especially in the ports of South China, should be curbed. It seems that one side strengthens the control of imports to reduce non-essential payments, and the exchange rate can seek a more natural level from legal trade, so that the long-stagnant export trade can be promoted, and remittances from overseas Chinese can also reduce leakage, so that the supply and demand of foreign exchange in the market gradually offset.

### US Treasury Bills Still Sold at the Official Exchange Rate

[Central News Agency, Our City] Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance, stated at the press conference hosted by National Bank Governor Zhang at 8:00 p.m. on the 17th that US Treasury bills will continue to be sold at the official exchange rate and there will be no changes.

### Liu Weizhi Discusses Remittances from Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Our City] Liu Weizhi, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, recently expressed his satisfaction with the government's revised foreign exchange management regulations. Liu stated that in the past, because the official foreign exchange rate differed greatly from the black market rate, remittances from overseas Chinese were evading, and the country suffered inestimable losses. At a time when exports are sluggish, obtaining foreign exchange relies solely on borrowing, but this is not a proper solution. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the issue of remittances from overseas Chinese. Liu said that it is unfair to attribute the reason for the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese to overseas Chinese, because they suffer too much loss when settling at the official exchange rate, and the country should adhere to the principle of fairness. Therefore, revising the foreign exchange regulations was long overdue, and its implementation at this time already feels late. Liu believes that the new foreign exchange regulations will enable the government to regain control of all remittances from overseas Chinese and replenish the foreign exchange fund. However, whether the new regulations can achieve the expected results depends on whether the overseas Chinese remittance agencies can cope properly. Liu pointed out that in 1937, remittances from overseas Chinese amounted to 580 million national currency, and in 1938, it amounted to over 700 million yuan. At its peak, remittances from overseas Chinese reached US$300 million per year. If the pre-war amount can be restored in the future, the benefits to the national economy will definitely not be insignificant.

### Australian Banker Wood to Visit China This Weekend

[Central News Agency, Sydney, 16th] Wood, Director of the Foreign Exchange Management Department of the Australian and British United Nations Bank, will fly to China on the 23rd for a month-long visit to study Chinese banking and currency issues, as the two are related to the future possible trade development between China and Australia. Wood will visit Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and other cities, and will discuss financial and trade issues with Chinese bankers and officials. After visiting China, he will continue to visit the Philippines, Vietnam, Siam, and the Malay Peninsula base.

### Economic Commission Member Huang Yuanbin Talks to Reporters about the Characteristics of the New Foreign Exchange Measures, Which Can Be a Transitional Method for Reforming the Monetary System

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Huang Yuanbin, a member of the National Grain Commission, told reporters on the 17th that the revision of the foreign exchange management and import/export trade regulations is the most reasonable transitional method for reforming the monetary system. He pointed out five characteristics of the method: (1) Foreign exchange policy should ensure reasonable imports, smooth exports, and no loss of remittances from overseas Chinese. In the past, raising foreign exchange rates had very short-term effects and expired after a period of time. The method set this time is nominally not raising foreign exchange, but in reality, it allows the foreign exchange price to be adjusted naturally, which can solve the problems of import and export and remittances from overseas Chinese, and can continue to be effective. (2) The method set this time stipulates that cotton, grain, fertilizer, and coal are supplied by the government, and the total value of foreign exchange at the official price is about US$150 million per year, which accounts for half of the total import value, and the remaining half is for other imported goods. In the past, foreign exchange and remittances from overseas Chinese obtained from export goods were about US$200 million per year. Except for a small portion of remittances from overseas Chinese that are remitted to Hong Kong, the rest is offset by the foreign exchange required for other imported goods. The demand is equivalent, and the Central Bank can borrow foreign exchange, so the market price of foreign exchange will not have a sharp rise and can be adjusted naturally. (3) It is most reasonable for the government to supply foreign exchange at the official price to purchase essential goods, and for other imported goods to be settled at the market rate. In the past, if the rich consumed gasoline supplied with foreign exchange at the official price, it was the tax paid by the poor. Such phenomena can be avoided in the future. (4) There is no fair market price for remittances from overseas Chinese, and as a result, remittances from overseas Chinese flow to Hong Kong, which is suitable for smuggling in South China. The market price in the new method is the same as the black market in Hong Kong, so remittances from overseas Chinese will no longer flow to Hong Kong. (5) The new method can stimulate the production of export goods, normalize imports, and reasonably adjust foreign trade. Huang also pointed out that there should be two supplementary measures to stop remittances from overseas Chinese from flowing to Hong Kong: (1) The remittance slips for remittances from overseas Chinese can be filled out in foreign currency and remitted back to the country, and they can be freely deposited into foreign currency deposits and exchanged for legal currency at any time. (2) Imported goods must be in accordance with the thrift method. After a certain period, all agricultural products will be confiscated nationwide. Huang concluded that to eliminate speculation and stimulate general production and people's employment, the reform of the monetary system is still needed.

### Stabilization Committee Established Today; Chen Huide Appointed Chairman; Listing and Designated Banks to Announce Regulations Separately

[Our Newspaper] According to Central Bank Governor Zhang, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will officially begin operating in the Central Bank today. The issues of designated banks, foreign exchange brokers, and foreign exchange listing still need to be announced separately today. The list of members of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is as follows:

Chairman: Chen Huide. Members: Xu Baiyuan, Shen Xirui.

List of Members of Export/Import Committee

The list of members of the Export/Import Management Committee is as follows: Chairman: Zhang Jia'ao. Vice Chairmen: Li Ming, Li Guo. Members: Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, Weng Wenhao, Miao Jiaming, Xu Baiyuan, Shen Xirui, Xu Jiji.

### Foreign Exchange Market Will Tend to Stabilize; Lou Tongsun Discusses the Main Purpose of the New Measures

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, told reporters on the 17th that the government's new foreign exchange measures, although somewhat late, are still a timely measure. The new policy is stricter in spirit than in the past in terms of import restrictions. China has always been an import-surplus country, and the balance of international payments has not been balanced. This type of measure should be understood by all. In order to achieve balance, the United Kingdom has also adopted emergency and strict controls. Before taking this measure, our government had conducted careful research and estimated the imports: (1) Cotton, (2) Rice, Flour, (3) Fertilizer, (4) Coal, coke, and other four kinds of essential goods for people's livelihood. The government plans to settle foreign exchange at the official price, with a total value of about 160 million US dollars. Other imported goods, such as kerosene, tobacco leaves, wood, and fuel oil, total about 282.4 million US dollars. The two together total about 442.4 million US dollars. In terms of exports, in addition to soybeans, minerals, and other goods that are bartered with foreign countries, export goods can earn about 182.4 million yuan, plus 100 million US dollars from remittances from overseas Chinese, and foreigners' expenses in (including diplomatic personnel and charitable organizations) are estimated at about 39 million, totaling 321.4 million. Comparing the two figures, the trade deficit is about 121 million. Therefore, the black market may be stimulated by this, but soybeans and minerals can earn 21 million, international relief funds can earn 25 million, and cotton loans can earn 15 million, totaling 121 million. The political changes can actually achieve balance. At the same time, Article 9 of the new regulations strictly restricts importers and foreign merchants from purchasing goods. Without obtaining a permit, they are not allowed to contact foreign merchants. According to the reporter, if everything can be implemented smoothly, the foreign exchange market will definitely tend to stabilize after a considerable period of time. After the foreign exchange stabilizes, import and export can return to normal and tend to be active, and the domestic market can also be active. This is the main purpose of this measure. It is hoped that Chinese and foreign merchants can understand this point and assist the government in implementing national policies to save the Chinese economic crisis recognized by the general public. Lou finally told reporters in a very confident tone that the Shanghai black market will definitely not fluctuate recently after the implementation of this measure.

### Head of Canadian Delegation to Japan, Creera, to Arrive in China the Day After Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] General Creera, head of the Canadian delegation to Japan, will fly to Beijing from Japan on the 20th. He will pay a three-day visit to Beijing and will also meet with Chairman Jiang. Accompanying General Creera on his visit to Beijing are Brigadier General Wright and industrialist Brook. The delegation recently visited Japan and met with General MacArthur to discuss the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade. Canadian Ambassador Davis will hold a cocktail party on the 22nd to welcome them.

### Peng Xuepei Arrives in Shanghai, Talks About Impressions of the Northwest

[Central News Agency, Our City] Peng Xuepei, Member of the Executive Yuan, flew to Shanghai from Xi'an on the 16th. Peng told reporters on the 17th that the poverty in the Northwest is beyond imagination, and the development of the Northwest urgently needs to be implemented quickly with both short-term and long-term considerations. Peng believes that the current situation in Xinjiang is quite complicated, but except for a few ambitious elements who are creating chaos, most people are inclined to the central government and hope for peace and stability. Peng also said that the communists recently gathered 14 brigades of troops in northern Shaanxi and launched an offensive, which has been defeated by the National Army. A certain division of the National Army participating in this battle rushed to the front line from the rear. On the way, the officers and soldiers of the entire division were selfless and sleepless, lasting for four nights, which is truly commendable.

### To Enable Rational Data; Financial Advisor Plans to Go to Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc.; Delegation to Host Political Figures on Friday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Weidemayer's consultants Hua Yu reporters, Weidemayer's delegation returned to Beijing on the 16th, and immediately began the final sorting and classification of the collected data. All data will be divided into three categories: most important, secondary, and unimportant, to let Liu Cao draft the report when knowing the priority election. Before leaving China, the Ling delegation will no longer travel as a group, and one or two consultants may go to several locations to work. Financial Advisor Ren Jins will go to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places again, and another advisor will go to Hubei and Chongqing to conduct inspections. Weidemayer himself has no intention of traveling elsewhere. It has not yet been decided whether he will meet with visitors in Beijing and make an appointment to see Kugan again, and it is not convenient to declare in advance when he will see Chairman Jiang again. The invitation cards for the cocktail party to be held by the delegation on the 22nd have been issued yesterday. Many government directors, people from various parties, and social elites have been invited. It is heard that Weishi will reveal one or two achievements in the past four weeks, and express his gratitude to all parties that provide information. Mr. Hua Sheng also predicted that this week will be the most important and busiest time, and if there are no special events, no more press releases will be issued. Weishi did not meet with Bengue on the 17th, nor did he visit Chairman Jiang. He stayed at the Shanghai Road Embassy's official residence to work all day.

### TASS Falsely Reports on Weidemayer's Visit to China

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently told reporters that regarding General Weidemayer's visit to China, TASS recently sent a telegram from Nanjing, stating that after Weishi came to China, he put forward some "harsh" requirements involving politics and military affairs as conditions for US loans. This news is completely fabricated and has no basis. According to the TASS report from Nanjing on the 10th, the conditions proposed by the US side included leasing some Chinese air force bases and supervising the work of various departments of the Chinese government.

### Vacancies on the Democratic Socialist Party's Government Committee; Replacements Already Internally Determined

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] It is reported that after the dismissal of Wu Xianzi and Li Daming from the Democratic Socialist Party's Government Committee and Political Committee, the vacancies are said to have been internally decided to be filled by Tang Zhuxin and Yang Xiaoming.

[Our City] The First National Congress of the Reformist Faction of the Democratic Socialist Party has been held in Yiyuan for several days. The third meeting was held on the 17th, attended by more than 60 people including Wu Xianzi and Liang Weishui. When discussing and reviewing the political platform proposed by the Review Committee, there was a fierce debate. Some people advocated deleting all the words "un-min speech", "warlord", and "capital of the wealthy" in the preface, and also abolishing similar rigid regulations on the restriction of private property and land in the articles. Some people opposed this proposal, and both sides insisted for a long time. Zuo Linfeng, Wang Jingdong, and others withdrew midway, and the meeting was once suspended. Wan Wuyu was on the podium, angrily tearing off the red strip of the presidium he was wearing, saying that he was old and could no longer see such scenes, and suddenly burst into tears. Later, Sun Baogang and Wang Shiming replaced him, and the latter gave way, and many were deleted and revised. As a result, it became a very moderate and neutral political platform. The agenda for today is to discuss various proposals in the morning and elect central committee members and standing committee members in the afternoon. The meeting may be closed on the 19th.

### Strengthening Control over South China; We Sign an Agreement with Hong Kong; Hong Kong Government Issues Statement Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] Central Bank Governor Zhang officially announced at the press conference on the 17th that our country and the Hong Kong government have reached an agreement on trade, remittances from overseas Chinese, smuggling, finance, and other issues, and have signed an agreement. The detailed contents of the agreement have been agreed upon by both parties to be officially released simultaneously on August 23. Governor Zhang also received a statement from the Hong Kong government on the 17th, as follows: The Chinese government and the Hong Kong government, after lengthy and thorough negotiations, have reached an agreement on financial and economic issues of mutual concern. It has also been decided that the measures agreed upon by both parties will be of considerable benefit to the Chinese government's control of trade and foreign exchange in South China. Hong Kong, due to its special status as a transshipment port, has also taken into account the commercial interests that need to be protected. This negotiation was completed in an atmosphere of harmony and cooperation, which is sufficient to promote financial and economic cooperation between the two sides to cope with common problems and open a new era in the relationship between the two sides. The content of the agreement will be released in the near future.

### Returning from Dalian

— Dong Xin

In the past, the Northeast only had two special municipalities, and Dalian was one of them. The cleanliness of its streets, the smoothness of its transportation, the convenience of its waterways, and so on, were all comparable to modern metropolises. Dalian's location is the lip and shield of the Northeast. Those with ambition to invade the Northeast all entered through here. For nearly fifty years, Dalian has not returned to the embrace of the motherland. Its strategic location is evident from this. After the Japanese bandits seized Dalian from Russia, they regarded Dalian as their own territory. They meticulously planned every aspect, constantly expanding, actively relocating islanders, and trying every possible means to develop and construct. As a result, it gradually became prosperous, but everything in Dalian was entirely controlled by the Japanese. Until victory came, the Japanese bandits surrendered, and the Dalian compatriots eagerly awaited the government's early takeover. However, reality did not meet expectations, and the Allied forces arrived first. So-called liberation and salvation were nothing more than that. Subsequently, bandit armies took advantage of the chaos, acting as bullies, conducting struggles and purges in various forms. The Dalian compatriots fell into deep misery once again, now desperately struggling. With their last breath, they cried out, "Dear motherland! Come and save us! Save us!" Two years ago, according to enemy statistics, Dalian's population was over 800,000 (including Japanese, Koreans, and Soviets). Now, with the repatriation of Japanese residents, the exodus of ambitious youth and wealthy individuals, and the escape of traitors, only about 100,000 people remain in Dalian. Adding the compatriots who fled from Jiaodong due to the struggles, the total is less than 200,000. Given the vastness of the Dalian urban area and the sparse population, the desolate and deserted state is self-evident. Regarding economic issues, the highest authority in Dalian, the "Fake Guandong Public Office," intended to manipulate the economy by deliberately issuing "Guandong Public Currency." Because I was part of the inspection group to Dalian, I prevented this action. Due to the delay, the people were aware, and the atmosphere grew tense daily, with inflation expected at any moment. Later, when there was no other option, a notice was issued stating that it was a rumor, and the matter was terminated. Later, a particularly vicious method was used to confiscate the assets of the people. All private funds were forcibly deposited into government banks, with the claim that stamps would be affixed. People generally believed this, assuming that after affixing the stamps, the money would be returned. Of course, they never imagined it would be confiscated, but once the money entered the tiger's mouth, they were helpless. When the deadline arrived, it was announced that the money would be returned based on the number of people in the household: 3,000 for adults and 1,000 for children, with the remainder frozen. Therefore, the economy was frozen, and the people suffered endlessly. When the inspection group was about to arrive in Dalian on June 1st, Dalian began scrubbing street slogans, changing police uniforms, and training civilians and shops on how to answer the inspection group's questions. It also began moving major factories to Jinzhou and preparing countermeasures for the inspection group's arrival. Street posts were increased, and the tea servers at the Yamato Hotel were replaced with special agents. When the inspection group arrived in Lushun, the reporter was in Dalian. According to the bandit army, the inspection group did not recognize the "Guandong Public Office" in Lushun, and the Soviet Union maintained an objective stance. Therefore, what should have been heard and seen was not, and only a superficial inspection was conducted.

Currently, in Dalian Bay, the only ships coming and going are those with the red star emblem. The items traded are very simple: one is military supplies, and the other is food. Food is loaded to be shipped out, and military supplies are unloaded. Recently, Dalian has experienced a food shortage, and a large ship called the "Lenin" has been dispatched, with a capacity of over 3,000 tons, regularly sailing to Zhifu, once a week. Military supplies are taken out, and wheat is brought back. Recently, merchants from Yantai have reported that grain prices there are increasing daily, and the people's lives are a struggle under oppression. Their only hope is for "takeover." We can guess the meaning of "poor people turning over," but the methods are ridiculous. Around this time last year, ordinary poor people randomly robbed passing goods on the streets, and theft became even more rampant. Later, almost no one dared to transport goods on the roads. The scope of the poor's power expanded excessively, which was unacceptable, so restrictions were imposed. Now, at least they can't openly rob, only steal secretly. The most tragic thing is the government buildings and residences left by the Japanese bandits. Apart from being occupied by Soviet and bandit army cadres, the interior wood, walls, and floors have all been demolished. The bandit army in Dalian has no sovereignty in anything. Compared to Jiamusi and Harbin, the state of terror is just beginning. Most of their staff are recruited from the lower levels, such as coachmen, rickshaw pullers, and ice cream vendors, who are all special agents. The Dalian bandit army wears full police uniforms (identical to the Shenyang police uniforms). When the inspection group arrived in Dalian, the Soviet Union claimed that this was a Chinese democratic allied army not subject to any control and that it was also implementing the Three Principles of the People. Before the inspection group arrived, a large number of bandit cadres were transported to North Korea for the Fifth Offensive Conference. Those who were transferred back were all in the Lushun and Jinzhou areas, and there were very few in Dalian city. In Dalian, the Soviet Union acts like a victorious country entering a defeated country. After the Soviet Union announced "no death penalty" on June 1st, drunk drivers in Jeeps immediately killed eight Chinese people, but there was no news of it in the newspapers, and no words of assurance on the radio. Is this democracy? Is this freedom of speech? The good residences at the foot of the Dalian mountains and the very tidy houses in Jinzhou are all occupied by high-ranking officials. Ninety-nine percent of the factories are empty. The most bizarre thing is that the people of Dalian still have a hierarchy: first the Soviets, then the bandits, then the Japanese, then the Koreans, and only fifth are the Chinese people. The Japanese often use women to please the Soviets and gain favor, so they can look down on the Chinese just like before. There are even many who collude with the bandits.

The patriotism of the Dalian compatriots is indelible, but there is a severe lack of spiritual and cultural sustenance.

### National Army Recaptures Zouping Like a Hot Knife Through Butter, Jiaozhou-Xingwang Road West Section Opened Up, Continues to Pursue and Annihilate Remnant Bandits in Western Shandong and Eastern Henan

[Our Newspaper Qingdao Seventeenth Dispatch] The National Army advancing westward along the Jiaoji Railway line, like a hot knife through butter, entered Zhangdian Station on the evening of the sixteenth, and will join forces with another National Army unit in Zhangdian. The western section of the Jiaoji Road is now open. Only a few small stations between Gaomi and Fangzi in the eastern section have not yet been recovered. The National Army is taking advantage of its victory to sweep and clear them out, which will soon complete the cleanup. [Central News Agency Jinan Seventeenth Dispatch] The National Army on the Jiaoji Line continues to make progress. The western National Army recaptured Zouping at 5:00 PM on the seventeenth. [Our Newspaper Jinan Seventeenth Dispatch] The Shandong war situation has taken the form of a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves. The National Army has achieved a comprehensive and decisive victory. Currently, the communist bandits have only left remnants of the Seventh Column in the central Shandong mountain area and remnants of the Ninth Column in eastern Jinan. The main remnants have retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River. Therefore, all areas south of the Yellow River are completely within the National Army's range. Only a few local communist bandit teams are being cleared out by the National Army. In recent days, the National Army's advance along the Jiaoji Road and on both sides of the north and south has been extremely smooth. They have not encountered stubborn resistance from the communist bandits along the way. In some cases, the communist bandits fled at the mere sight of them without even fighting. Many strongholds have been recovered by the National Army. Currently, there are no major bandit army forces in the Zibo mining area. The National Army is advancing from both the north and south and will recapture the area by evening. The areas north of the Jiaoji Road and south of the Xiaoqing River, including Qidong, Zouping, Changshan, Huantai, and Yangjiaogou, will be fully occupied by the National Army by tomorrow. Currently, administrative personnel from various counties in Shandong have successively returned with the army to their posts. The National Army in the area west of the Jinpu Road and south of the Yellow River is also sweeping up the remaining communists. It is expected that after the cleanup work on the south bank of the Yellow River is completed, an annihilation war will be launched on the plains north of the Yellow River. [Our Newspaper Xuzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] The National Army in eastern Henan is advancing rapidly. The three National Army units advancing southward from the Longhai Road reached Hao County, Zhecheng, and Xunmukou east of Fugou on the morning of the seventeenth. The communist bandits suffered heavy casualties. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's First, Second, Third, and Sixth Columns were routed and fled towards Fugou, Yanling, Xihua, and Huaiyang. The National Army is in pursuit. According to military sources, the remnants of Liu Bocheng's forces have been completely routed. However, the remaining bandits are attempting to flee to the Tongbai Mountains and Dabie Mountains, but this will be difficult to achieve. The communist bandit's Fourth New Column, which was rumored to be in the Hongchuankou area southwest of Yuncheng in western Shandong, broke through the encirclement on the evening of the sixteenth and fled in three groups to Huangzhenji (9 kilometers east of Heze), Shuibao (20 kilometers northwest of Yucheng), and Dinglichang (south of Yuncheng). The National Army is tracking and pursuing them.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] Transportation between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou on the Longhai Road was restored on the seventeenth. Express trains are now running in both directions.

### National Army Completes Sweeping Mission, Communist Bandits in Eastern Hebei Disintegrated, Frequent Bandit Movement Near Shijiazhuang

[Our Newspaper Tianjin Seventeenth Dispatch] After the National Army implemented zonal sweeping in eastern Hebei, the mission is nearing completion. The Ye Le Detachment and the Forty-eighth Regiment, which were entrenched near Leting, the Lulong and Qian'an Detachments on the west bank of the Luan River, the Sanxiang Detachment near Sanhe, and the communist bandit's old nest at Yutian Yahongqiao have been successively defeated. Many have been broken up into smaller groups and fled to the mountains.

[Central News Agency Baoding Seventeenth Dispatch] The strong sweeping by the National Army in the Pingjinbao triangle area has largely come to an end. The Seventy-fourth, Seventy-fifth, Seventy-sixth, and Seventy-seventh Regiments under the Tenth Military Sub-district of the Communist Bandits suffered setbacks in Yongqing, Xiongxian, and other places. Their remnants have been driven to Anxin Baiyangdian to lie low and reorganize in an attempt to regroup. [Central News Agency Baoding Sixteenth Dispatch] Communist bandits around Shijiazhuang are moving frequently. The various brigades under the Central Military Region near Lecheng moved towards Baoyan on the afternoon of the fifteenth. The Second Column under Nie Rongzhen, which is under Shijiazhuang's northeast jurisdiction, also launched a probing attack on the outskirts of Zhengding on the morning of the sixteenth.

### Qualification of Journalists Must Be Strictly Regulated, Capital Journalists Association Cables to Provide Opinions

[Central News Agency Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] At the third joint meeting of directors and supervisors held by the Capital Journalists Association on the seventeenth, there was a heated discussion on the issue of determining the identity of journalists. It was generally agreed that the regulations should be strictly enforced, and a resolution was drafted and cabled to the industry across the country, urging unanimous support. The full text is as follows:

Central News Agency to all newspapers, news agencies, and journalists associations across the country: Journalists are responsible for guiding public opinion and are at the forefront of democratic politics. At this time when the country is moving towards constitutionalism, we feel even more the importance of their own mission. Regarding the issue of strictly determining the identity of journalists, the industry in various places has had discussions, and people from all walks of life are paying close attention. The people of this association serve the capital and dedicate themselves to the newspaper industry, believing that this issue must be resolved with the most rigorous attitude and the spirit of impartiality, so that journalists who serve the people will not be condemned by the people, and those who are responsible for leading public opinion will not be subject to the control of public opinion. We respectfully offer the following views to the industry across the country: (1) The qualifications of journalists must be strictly regulated. Journalists associations in various places must conduct strict reviews of applicants, and Article 1 of the Journalists Law promulgated by the National Government in 1943 but not implemented is very appropriate and can be used as a benchmark. The law stipulates that anyone who works in a daily newspaper or news agency as a publisher, writer, editor, interviewer, or who is in charge of publishing or advertising is a journalist. The spirit of the law is very rigorous. When this association was established last year, the regulations on membership qualifications were based on this law. However, considering the importance of proofreaders in the newspaper-making process and the fact that the news reporting by broadcast journalists is no different from the work of newspaper journalists, we referred to precedents in various countries and included these two types of employees in the scope of journalists. This amendment is offered to the industry across the country for reference. This association is very strict in reviewing the qualifications of applicants. Given the abundance of newspapers and news agencies in the capital and the large number of reporters stationed in Beijing from other places, the total number of members of this association is only over 500. Strictly regulating the qualifications of journalists is actually to enhance the credibility of our industry. (2) The qualification of journalists should be limited to those who take the news industry as their profession. Reporting current events and promoting public opinion not only requires specialized knowledge and skills, but also must be specialized, dedicated, and regard this as a battle, because the country values ​​journalists, and the people trust journalists, respect them as mentors, and rely on them as ears and eyes, because they can specialize in their work, dedicate themselves to service, abide by professional ethics, and maintain professional credibility, not something that can be filled by unqualified personnel. (3) The qualification of journalists should be uniform throughout the country and should not be slightly different. At this time when the general election is imminent, we should strictly guard against the abuse of false names, so as not to set a bad example for constitutional government and damage the dignity of the news industry. This association proposes that the government should promptly promulgate journalists' laws and that journalists' organizations in various places should abide by them uniformly. Those who fail to meet the standards will not be recognized by law, and public opinion across the country will impose sanctions on them. The above three points are the common views of the people of this association. We hope that the industry across the country will unanimously agree and that the government authorities will act quickly, so as to prevent the abuses of elections and set an example for constitutional government. The people of this association look forward to it very much. Capital Journalists Association, August 17th printed.

### Legislative Yuan Delegation Inspects the United States, Unanimous Welcome from American Government and Public, Scheduled to Visit Canada at the End of This Month

[Our Newspaper, New York Special Correspondent Hangxun] The visit of the Chinese Legislative Yuan delegation to the United States this time has been highly valued by overseas Chinese and American officials and civilians alike. After arriving in Washington, D.C., on July 7, the delegation visited House Speaker Martin and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton on the 9th to discuss governance (Note: Martin is a presidential candidate, and Eaton is a Republican congressman with high qualifications). On the 10th, they visited Vincent, Director of the Far East Bureau of the State Department. On the 11th, they inspected the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.), which is perfectly equipped and highly efficient. On the 13th, they attended a welcoming meeting held by overseas Chinese. On the 14th, Ambassador Koo hosted a cocktail party at the embassy, inviting several members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, ambassadors to the U.S. from various countries, and leaders from the State Department, education, culture, and finance to meet with the three members of the delegation: Wu Shangying, Zhang Zhaoyuan, and Sheng Zhenwei, and discuss various topics for three hours. On the 15th, during Ambassador Koo's dinner party, they met with former French Prime Minister Herriot and the ambassadors to the U.S. from Belgium, Turkey, and other countries. On the 16th, the delegation visited the Library of Congress, the most comprehensive library in the world, and the State Department hosted a cocktail reception at Blair House, which is used to entertain visiting dignitaries. Many members of both houses of Congress and central government officials attended, and the newly appointed Director of the Far East Bureau of the U.S. State Department, White, also rushed to attend. At noon on the 21st, Au Shang, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Sheng Zhenwei, and their accompanying personnel, accompanied by Ambassador Koo, met with President Truman and discussed matters for fifteen minutes, and took a group photo in the President's office in the White House. At noon on the 22nd, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton and Congressman Fulton and others hosted a reception for the delegation in the House restaurant. Wu, Zhang, and Sheng, as well as their advisors and secretaries, attended. More than 30 Republican congressmen attended, and Eaton, Fulton, and female congressional aide Bolton delivered speeches welcoming the delegation. On the Chinese side, Ambassador Koo, Secretary-General Wu Shangying, and Chairman Zhang Zhaoyuan delivered replies, and both hosts and guests were pleased. On the 23rd, they dined with several Democratic senators in the Senate. At this time, both houses were meeting day and night to expedite the completion of all bills in order to adjourn on schedule on July 26. Therefore, members of both houses spared time to meet, expressing their high regard for the first visit of Chinese legislators to the United States. Wu, Zhang, and Sheng all graduated from renowned American universities and have been serving the country for 25 to 30 years. American officials and civilians are aware of this, so they are very respectful to the three men. In addition, Wu, Zhang, and Sheng either attended sessions in the Senate and House of Representatives, or went to the Library of Congress and the Central Printing and Publishing Bureau to study laws, or exchanged views with individual congressmen. The three men divided the work and cooperated. Wu Shangying focused on the rights and interests of overseas Chinese and improving their treatment, while Zhang Zhaoyuan focused on commercial laws and economic assistance to China, and also advocated for the United States to lend silver to China to improve the currency system. Sheng Zhenwei focused on law, education, and court organization, and all made considerable gains. For example, the treatment of overseas Chinese in the United States and Canada has recently undergone many revisions, and improvements are expected to be made in the near future. Since the implementation of Article 298 of our country's Company Law, the laws in the western states of the United States prohibiting overseas Chinese from purchasing real estate have been repealed one after another. The so-called principle of equality and reciprocity is gradually being implemented. The loan of silver to China has attracted the deep attention of the American government and public. Speaker Martin also said that it is worthy of deep consideration. This is the activity of the Legislative Yuan delegation in Washington, D.C.

On July 27, the delegation went from Washington to New York, where Consul General Zhang and many overseas Chinese leaders welcomed them at the station. On the 29th, overseas Chinese held a meeting to welcome them. On the 31st, the Sino-American Chamber of Commerce held a round table meeting, attended by more than 20 of the chamber's chairmen and directors. The questions they raised were mostly focused on our country's Company Law, Banking Law, and the current difficult trade situation. Zhang Zhaoyuan and Wu Shangying, the drafters of our country's Company Law and Banking Law, respectively, answered and discussed for three and a half hours. The leaders of the Sino-American Chamber of Commerce all expressed their satisfaction and hoped that our country's Banking Law would be promulgated and the Insurance Law revised as soon as possible. On August 4, the delegation attended a session of the United Nations Security Council. On the 5th, they visited the famous Sing Ding Prison to study various facilities in detail and had lunch in the prison. On the 6th, Zhang and Sheng visited the Juvenile Court (which specializes in hearing cases involving male and female offenders aged 16 to 18). This type of court is not only unique to other countries, but also exists only in a few places in the United States. Its purpose is to prevent juveniles from mixing with adult prisoners to avoid them going astray. On the 8th, the two men again visited the Children's Court (which specializes in handling criminal cases involving boys and girls under the age of 16). Later, they went to the Family Court (which specializes in handling disputes over spousal support, and its nature is more inclined to investigation and mediation rather than divorce litigation). These are all things that our country has not yet established, and it is quite necessary to borrow from them. New York is the financial center of the United States. The members of the delegation have been busy visiting and inspecting for days, and exchanging views with business leaders. They are expected to travel to the capital of Canada after August 20 and have arranged to meet with Canadian Prime Minister King to exchange views on general legislative issues. After visiting Canada, the work in North America will come to an end, and then they will cross the Atlantic to the British Isles. To sum up the work of the delegation in the United States, the focus is on collecting information, striving for fair principles in our country's foreign-related legislation, explaining our country's laws to friendly countries so that they can understand them, and publicizing the reality of our country's preparations for constitutional government.

### Weekly Forum Pay Attention to China's Southwestern Gateway - Kham and Tibet!

— Hong Shibo

At present, Chinese people are all paying attention to the development of the China-North Burma incident, but they are not paying much attention to another aspect, China's southwestern gateway—Kham and Tibet. However, according to a report from the Kang-Tibetan Agency in Qamdo, "British Indian armed forces were discovered within the territory of Pomi in Kham, which is said to be because the chieftain of Pomi 'offered' Baimagang and other places to the British and came to negotiate acceptance with the Tibetan side." Pomi and Baimagang both belong to the four parts of Kham, adjacent to Tibet, bordering India to the south, and are inhabited by a mix of Qiang and Tibetan ethnic minorities. After the end of World War II, both China and Britain were among the five powers, but Britain's current actions are a bit strange. Isn't she always saying that she respects the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty? Xikang is our country's territory, so why did the British and Indian armed forces go to Pomi and Baimagang? Although they claim that the chieftain of Pomi "offered land" to the British, the chieftain of Pomi is a Chinese official and is under the command of the Chinese government. How could he offer land to the British? Because he does not have such power. Even if it is true, how could the Chinese government agree? Wouldn't that be suspected of alienating our nation? What is especially strange is that they are actually negotiating with the Tibetan side to take over the land! Tibet is a local administrative region in our country, although it is presided over by the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, it is still under the administration of our Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. If the British really want to "take over," they should negotiate directly with our government. How can they negotiate with the Tibetan side?

According to the location of Pomi and Baimagang, they are shown on most detailed maps. Their area is located between 29° and 31° north latitude and 94.5° and 97° east longitude, to the south of Suogong, Da'en, Baxoi, and Qamdo, in the southwest of eastern Kham, bordering the Assam province of India, at the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River (one of the main streams of the Ganges, also known as R. of Brahmaputra), which flows into India and is called the Brahmaputra River (R. of Brahmaputra). It meets with the main stream of the Ganges northeast of Calcutta and flows into the Bay of Bengal (B. of Bengal), so Pomi and Baimagang are actually located in the upper reaches of the Ganges. Above, it guards Lhasa, below, it points to Jiaozhi, internally, it arches Kang and Yunnan, and externally, it defends India and Burma, a crucial strategic location. The people are mostly Khampa and Tsangpa Tibetans (Chang-pa & Khang-pa), who speak the Kham language, North Assamese, or their own dialects, which belong to the Tibetan language family. The people are backward in knowledge, and education is not developed. The chieftain system still exists in the territory, with considerable authority. There are also a few British missionaries who enter Tibet from India to preach in the area. The territory is located in the Kang-Yunnan gorge area, between the Tibetan Plateau, with high mountains such as the Boshula Ridge, Anrili Mountain, and the Himalayas. At the bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, there is a small gorge basin, gradually expanding to the south, where wheat or highland barley can be grown. The people's lives are generally the same as in Tibet. High mountains and large rivers block the territory, making transportation very inconvenient. (This is in terms of our central government's management, but if you go north from the railway from Calcutta to Sadiya in India, you can directly reach our border; or if you enter Tibet from Yadong and transfer to Kham, it will be a bit farther, the difference in ease of travel for the host and guest is clear. Therefore, the British, taking advantage of their geographical advantage, have long had the idea of invading our border.) The territory is not very rich in products. The mountainous areas have lush forests, most of which have not been exploited. There are also many domestic animals, but there are no accurate statistics on mineral resources. Since occupying India, the British have annexed Sikkim, (Dranjong), Bhutan, and Nepal, removing all of our southwestern barriers, and then thinking of getting their hands on our Kham and Tibet. In the early years of the Republic, they used the Dalai Lama's pro-British sentiments to betray our country. After several negotiations, they finally acknowledged our continued suzerainty. In the sixth year of the Republic, the Tibetan lamas were fooled and launched an internal invasion, occupying more than a dozen counties in western Kham. Later, the British mediated, and the 16 counties in eastern Kham were governed by government troops, while the area west of Qamdo was temporarily occupied by Tibetan troops. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, the central government changed the Chuanbian Special Region to Xikang Province, and urgently sought a strategy for governing the border, but the provincial government has not yet been established. In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the government moved inland due to the Sino-Japanese Incident, and then划川西雅安·西昌·等 fifteen counties into Kang, before establishing the provincial government in Kangding, roughly forming a scale. However, its western part borders Tibet, and the provincial boundary has not yet been clearly demarcated. Ordinary maps generally use the Tanggula Mountain Pass to Wuding Mountain as the main line, but this is different from foreign-published maps. Foreign maps extend the eastern border of Tibet to near Zayu, including the chieftains of Pomi and Baimagang. Therefore, foreigners regard this area as within Tibetan territory. Although there is a provincial government in eastern Kham, it seems that Han and Yi people live together, and it is difficult to govern. Last year, the counties of Tianquan, Ya'an, and Rongjing had a war to suppress opium. Although it has been quelled, hidden worries cannot be ignored. The politics of western Kham are similar to those of Tibet. When there is an emergency on the Tibetan border, there is a risk of affecting the Kham border. Moreover, the chieftains are昏庸, their knowledge is浅陋, and they are easily fooled and exploited. Because the government is unable to reach them, even though it clearly hears about them, it can only sit back and watch its development, causing foreign troubles to arise one after another. As for the area along India in southern Kham, it is even more coveted by the British, because its terrain is appropriately located in the northern border of the Ganges plain in India, and it is more convenient than Tibet, and there are no high mountains blocking it (the Tibetan-Indian border has the natural barrier of the Himalayas). After the construction of the town road from Calcutta to Sadiya, it is easier to get involved, which shows that they have long been premeditating to covet our border. The famous British geographical society George Philip & Son, LTD. had already劃入印度邊界 in its map published in 1936 (the border area is about fifty to seventy miles wide from west to Bhutan to the upper reaches of the Enmeikai River (R. or Nmai-kha)), planning to establish a North-East Frontier Province (this is what the author has seen, perhaps earlier maps were already like this), that is, until 1947, it has been ten years since then (maybe earlier), and we are ignorant of it.

In March and April of this year, there was an internal turmoil in Tibet. Originally, the political power of Tibet was in the hands of monks and nobles, most of the monks were pro-Han, and the lay people were pro-British. After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, the leader of the pro-Han faction, Lazhen, the host of Sera Monastery, was elected as the Regent, but after taking office, he was not in harmony with the pro-British faction, so the dispute became very deep. Later, the pro-British faction gained power, and Lazhen was squeezed out. In the 32nd year of the Republic, Lazhen cooperated with Liu Wenhui, the chairman of Xikang Province, and launched the变 of Sera, Ganden, and Drepung monasteries, but the result could not reverse the decline. Recently, the Regent of Tibet, Dazha, is about to resign due to old age, and Lazhen has a tendency to make a comeback. The pro-British faction struck first and arrested Lazhen, sentencing him for treason. Especially Lhalu had a feud with Lazhen for killing his father, and Liang was jealous, so he took revenge in mid-March, gouging out Lazhen's eyes. In mid-April, he was secretly executed. The three major monasteries were dissatisfied and rebelled, resulting in this internal turmoil. Although it has now been quelled, there is still a possibility of recurrence at any time. According to news, the reason why Lhalu and others dared to do this is because there is a certain background relationship behind them. Although the pro-British faction is like this, it is still afraid that Liu Wenhui will lead troops into Tibet, so the Tibetan army has built fortifications on the border between Kham and Tibet and near the Nujiang River, actively increasing defenses, which shows their fear of the central government.

Our country's border connected to the longest one, besides the Soviet Union, is India. However, our country has always used a政策 policy in the southwestern border, and does not think about实边图防. Although the situation is slightly better than in the past, due to different ethnic groups, remote land, blocked transportation, unsuitable climate, and the lack of active border policy, the incompetence of border affairs ministers, and restricted by other various environments, there is still no proper solution. If the strength allows in the future, we should first set up the Sichuan-Tibet Railway from Chengdu through Kangding, Bamo, Qamdo, Suogong, and Taizhao to Lhasa or Shigatse, connecting with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Not only can the local products of the southwest such as wool, antelope horn, musk, deer antler, rhinoceros horn, placer gold, and petroleum be exchanged for the products of the Yangtze River basin, but the significance in terms of governance and military affairs is especially important. Therefore, after the completion of the Trans-China Railway, Kham and Tibet can directly depend on the central government, which is more convenient for command. Build highways in secondary places. Then instill education, open up the people's minds, improve the land, increase production, integrate ethnic groups, eliminate barriers, actively build, and make things progress together. Of course, there are many other conditions, abolish the current land system, re-divide the counties, set up provincial governments, and make the administrative system completely the same as the inland, so that it is directly governed by the central government. The effect of governing will definitely be more convenient than it is now.

Since the Pomi incident has developed to this point, I hope that our government should not only lodge a strong protest with the British government and order its troops to withdraw beyond our country's borders, but also strengthen our borders and give them a military counterattack. In addition, we can also collect evidence and appeal to the United Nations Security Council when necessary, in order to obtain a fair judgment.

### Joint Meeting of Two Dominions Discusses Indian Defense Issues Decides to Strengthen Security Forces in Ben-Cheb Province

[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] Following two days of jubilant celebrations, the Indian Union and Pakistan have today begun to address national affairs, with defense being their first priority. The Joint Defense Council of the Indian Union and Pakistan, chaired by Mountbatten, began considering the security policies of the two dominions in New Delhi today. The council members include the Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah, the Supreme Commander of India, Marshal Auchinleck, and the Defense Ministers of both dominions. However, Jinnah did not attend and was represented by Prime Minister Ali Khan. The main issue facing the Joint Defense Council is the defense of the Northwest Frontier Province, known as the "Gateway to India." The Northwest Frontier Province belongs to Pakistan. In addition, the Bolan Pass, which connects Balochistan to the Indian plains, and the Sylhet district of Assam, which overlooks the Ganges River, are also within Pakistan's territory. Therefore, Pakistan plays a significant role in the land defense of the Indian peninsula. The Indian Union has a long coastline, so it bears a heavier responsibility for maritime defense. Mountbatten is scheduled to leave New Delhi for Mumbai today to bid farewell to the first batch of British troops withdrawing from India. [United Press, New Delhi, 16th] The Joint Defense Council of the two Indian dominions decided today to strengthen the security forces in Ben-Cheb Province to curb the state of anarchy in the province.

### Greek Guerrilla Leader Officially Announces Establishment of "Free Greek Provisional Government" Guerrilla Radio Station Located in the Capital of Albania

[United Press, Athens, 16th] Greek guerrilla leader General Vafiadis announced today via radio the establishment of a "Free Greek Provisional Government."

At the same time, the Third Army Command in Thessaloniki announced that guerrilla activity had intensified in more than ten locations from western Thrace to western Macedonia in the past forty-eight hours, using heavy artillery that the government army does not have to attack. The Greek constabulary also seized many printed copies of the guerrilla government's declaration of establishment, and the prosecutor is about to file a public prosecution. However, the official side is not surprised, believing that the guerrillas had already announced the establishment of a provisional government. This move is sufficient to provide the government army with an offensive target, which is particularly beneficial to the government army, which has always failed to induce the guerrillas to engage in a direct battle.

### Responding to Attlee's First Prime Ministerial Appeal Churchill Broadcast Speech Accuses the Labour Government of Mismanagement

He also accused the Labour government of mismanagement, unwisely spending American loans, placing party and class prejudices above the needs of the country, and proposing far from necessary measures to cope with the country's economic crisis. He believed that only by allowing individual effort, free enterprise and the use of talents, maintaining individual risk-taking, and unequal prices and rewards, with competition as the basis for selection, could forty-seven million people survive. Churchill denounced Prime Minister Attlee's announced restoration of certain wartime coercive systems, believing that he himself, as well as conservatives, free-thinking conservatives, liberals and socialists, could not recognize them as part of Britain's peacetime plan.

### "God Created Man, I Created Cities" Summary of the International Municipal Federation

—Kong Qiuquan from Paris—

Mr. Gu Bapo said: "God created man, and man created cities." For thousands of years, cities have been the source of civilization and history, and under the capitalist economic system, cities are the most concentrated places for economy, politics, talent, and technology. However, after the cruel destruction of war, the heart and shell of the city have obviously become increasingly desolate. In order to engage in restoration and reconstruction, the International Municipal Federation recently held its 7th annual meeting in Paris, France.

In addition to China, the countries attending this meeting also included the United States, France, Britain, the Netherlands, Canada, South Africa, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cuba, Ecuador, Italy, Hungary, Luxembourg, Norway, Brazil, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, and French Tunisia. Turkey, etc., a total of 26 countries, the number of people attending each country varies, with many as many as dozens. Such as the United Kingdom and France, because important cities in these two countries have representatives to participate. On the Chinese side, it was reported that Xi Yushu, Huang Boqiao, and Qian Tai, the standing directors of the Chinese Municipal Association and the president and vice president of the Shanghai branch, were appointed as representatives, but because Xi and Huang could not come, and Ambassador Qian was ordered to participate in the International Food Conference held at the same time in Paris, so as a result, Jiang Xiqu was asked to participate as a representative. The meeting opened on the anniversary of China's War of Resistance Against Japan (July 7) and closed on the 12th. The discussion was very enthusiastic during the week. The situation is recorded as follows:

Agenda and Discussion

According to the original agenda of the International Municipal Federation, the following four topics should be discussed by the group committee: (1) local autonomy; (2) public education (3) urban reconstruction; (4) expansion of the International Municipal Federation's organization. Later, due to difficulties in group discussions, it was decided to change to a general discussion. August 9th and 11th were for the attending representatives to report on the current situation of their respective cities on the three issues of local autonomy, public education, and urban reconstruction. On the morning of the 12th, a comprehensive conclusion was made based on the discussions of the previous three days. (1) "Local Autonomy" The current freedom of local governments in most countries is less than before the war due to the impact of wartime central government control. Also, due to local financial difficulties, there are many places where the central government needs to provide assistance, which makes the freedom of local governments more restricted. The best solution is that the central government should issue subsidies based on the financial needs of various places, and then the local governments should handle them themselves. (2) "Public Education" should be the responsibility of the local government, but it should not have political implications. The construction of urban housing is also related to the education of children. If the construction of housing can free mothers from having to devote all their energy to managing labor, then most of their time can be used to pay attention to the education of their children. (3) "Urban Reconstruction" It is hoped that countries participating in the International Municipal Federation can submit the following to the Municipal Federation: 1. estimates and data of buildings destroyed by war and enemies; 2. laws and land legislation related to local reconstruction; 3. budget data for local reconstruction, and I hope that the municipal organizations of various countries will pay special attention to the suggestions of the International Municipal Federation. On the afternoon of the 12th, the expansion of the International Municipal Federation's organization, the date and location of the next meeting, and other issues were discussed.

Date and Location of the Next Meeting

Expansion of the International Municipal Federation's organization and the date, location, and agenda of the next meeting.

(A) "Establishment of a Standing Bureau" It was decided to establish a standing bureau, and each member state should send two to three representatives to participate. Each representative should pay an annual membership fee of 1,200 Swiss francs (approximately US$300). The first plenary meeting of the Standing Bureau will be held between September and October of this year. All countries should promptly notify the Federation of the names of the municipal organizations that have joined the Federation and the names of the representatives participating in the Standing Bureau (the number of representatives participating in the Standing Bureau is based on the country). This matter is still the responsibility of the groups participating in this meeting. (B) Next Meeting (1) There will be meetings in both 1948 and 1949, but the Standing Bureau will decide which year will be the general meeting and which year will be the regular meeting.

(3) There were three proposals for the meeting location: the Czech Republic, Geneva, and Canada. The Standing Bureau will decide the location of the two meetings in 1948 and 1949. (3) The agenda for the next meeting should include: 1. Local Finance; 2. The scope of local economic activities; 3. Revision of various articles of association of the Federation;

The chairman and secretary-general of the conference were Haris, the president of the International Municipal Federation, and Wen Neike, the secretary-general, respectively. The damage to our country's cities after the war and the general construction plan were also submitted to the meeting, which was highly valued by the representatives of various countries. When the president of the conference, Mr. Haris, met with the representatives of this association, he praised the far-reaching ideals of the Great Shanghai Plan.

### Five Seafarer Groups Oppose Lowering Treatment to the Municipal Government Tomorrow to Petition Under Negotiation Express Government is Not Guaranteed Will Change Profession

The Chinese Merchant Ship Captains Association, the Chinese Marine Engineers Association, the Chinese Ship Radio Officers Association, and the Chinese Navigation Officers United Association and other five category A seafarer groups held a joint meeting yesterday, attended by Jin Yueshi, Lu Liangbing, Jiang Keni and other more than 20 people. Lu Liangbing was publicly elected as the chairman to discuss how to deal with the recent proposal by a certain shipping company to reduce the treatment of crew members. After deliberation, it was unanimously and resolutely opposed, a declaration was drafted to appeal to all sectors of society, and it was decided to collectively petition Mayor Wu on the morning of the 19th and negotiate with the National Federation of Trade Unions. The content of the petition and negotiation: (1) It is heard that some shipping companies are planning to reduce the treatment of crew members, (2) The life of crew members is monotonous and it is a dangerous occupation, so their treatment is universally preferential, (3) The treatment of crew members was resolved in July by the association and other shipping companies after the lifting of the cost of living index, and it is believed that the crew members have made great concessions, (4) The shipping company has obtained the approval of the government to negotiate prices on its own, and has repeatedly increased prices, and the current pricing has exceeded 100,000 times before the war, while the treatment of crew members, taking August as an example, is only more than 20,000 times, based on this comparison, it is unreasonable, how can it be reduced again, (5) Request a guarantee that it can only be increased and not reduced. If the government does not guarantee it, all category A crew members will inevitably abandon the difficult and seek the easy and change to other professions, (6) Request the government to severely punish the shipping company that proposes to reduce the treatment of crew members, (7) In order to maintain the Chinese shipping industry, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and vow to oppose the scum in the shipping company. It is heard that the association and others have jointly issued a notice to summon all members of the ship in Shanghai to participate in the petition to the municipal government.

### Central Meteorological Bureau Director Lu Jiong Scheduled to Go to the United States Lamented the Difficulty of Talented Technical Personnel

Lu Jiong, director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and is scheduled to go abroad to Washington on the 20th to attend the International Meteorological Conference. Lu is a famous meteorologist in China. In addition to working at the Meteorological Bureau, he also teaches at Central and Zhejiang Universities. Last year, Lu was ordered to go abroad to attend the first post-war International Meteorological Conference and was elected as one of the seven executive members of the International Meteorological Organization. He also served as a member of the Ocean Meteorological Special Committee of the organization. This trip to the United States is to attend as China's chief plenipotentiary representative.

A Total of Eighty-Nine Meteorological Stations Directly Under the Jurisdiction

The reporter visited Director Lu yesterday and inquired about the general weather conditions in China. It is said that there are a total of 89 meteorological stations directly under the Central Meteorological Bureau, distributed in major cities across the country. In addition, meteorological stations have also been established in various provinces and cities, and the expenses are borne individually by each province and city, and the personnel used are under the jurisdiction of the Meteorological Bureau. The difficulty previously felt by the Meteorological Bureau was the shortage of funds and the lack of technical personnel. The former difficulty has been slightly resolved with the large-scale withdrawal of American instruments to China, while the latter cannot be resolved in a short time. Because among the science colleges of various universities across the country, only Central University and Tsinghua University have meteorology departments, but the number of graduates each year is very small. For example, this year the Meteorological Bureau and the Meteorological Office of the Air Force Command need more than 200 technical personnel, while only two people graduated from Central University. How to allocate them? Although the Central Government has established a meteorological training class, the graduates can only take on ordinary technical work. Therefore, although the Meteorological Bureau has the determination to expand, it has not been able to achieve its wishes due to the inability to recruit talents. Director Lu hopes that various universities across the country can add more meteorology departments, and hopes that young students will study this interesting meteorology, so as to create a new road for China's meteorological community in the future.

### Dance Industry Holds Symposium Xin Chen Visits Mayor Wu

If the dance hall industry has any opinions, before the detailed implementation measures of the ban on dancing have been formulated, he will try his best to convey them to the central government for consideration and adoption. The industry also decided to send representatives to visit Mayor Wu at the municipal government at 11 am this morning

### Reconstruction of Wuzhen Road Overseas Chinese Bridge Funding of 150 Million

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to connect the traffic between Zhabei and Huxi, the Public Works Bureau plans to rebuild Wuzhen Road Bridge, which has been approved by the municipal government. The total funding has been approved at 150 million yuan and must be completed within the year. It is heard that after the completion, it will be exclusively limited to non-motorized vehicles. In addition, Chenjia Bridge, which connects the traffic on both sides of Longhua Port, is about to collapse due to years of disrepair. Recently, the Second Public Works Management Office of the Public Works Bureau has requested the Administrative Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to assist with most of the materials, which have been completed and opened to traffic recently. The employees of the Zhonghua Cigarette Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to use the factory's model. They have specially appointed representatives Zhou Xuexiang, Chen Guifang and others to petition the central government. The cigarette factories in this city also express sympathy for the workers of the factory. Yesterday afternoon, more than 500 workers from the factory and other factories took more than a dozen trucks to send off the representatives who went to Beijing to petition.

### ARA Air Transport Team Pilot's Bold Words

If we get British Mosquito Bombers, we can break the global flight record

[United Press City News] American aviator Rossberg, 30 years old, is serving in the Administrative Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Air Transport Team. According to his claim to the United Press reporter: He is trying to find someone to help him break the single-person global flight record.

### Train Thief Party Chief Arrested Could Not Stand Fatigue Interrogation Leading to the Arrest of Three Accomplices

Recently, jumping train theft cases have occurred frequently along the two lines, and the Road Bureau Police Department attaches great importance to it. On the 15th of this month, Director Wang ordered Criminal Police Team Detective Chief Kang Yimin, Detective Police Chief Zhang Yingjun, and Detective Police Liu Zuomin to go to Wuxi to investigate secretly. At 2:30 am on the 16th, Detective Chief Kang saw a young man in a blue cloth shirt and suspicious behavior on the platform of Xishi Station. Just as the 9th express train from Beijing to Shanghai arrived at Xishi, the young man boarded the train, and Kang and Detective Chief Zhang followed and monitored him.

Caught Off Guard Jumped Train to Escape

When the train left Xishi Station and the passengers were asleep, the young man suddenly stood up, first smoked a cigarette, and then left his seat to grope on the luggage rack, stealing a net bag containing 1.65 million yuan in legal tender and books and clothes (belonging to Yang Tongyuan, who came to Shanghai to take the Jiao Tong University entrance examination). After succeeding, he walked out of the carriage with big strides and a very generous attitude. At this point, Detective Chief Kang and Detective Police Chief Zhang, who were hiding in the dark, followed out. At this time, the criminal had reached the intersection of carriages 820 and 942, and was hugged by Police Chief Zhang. Unexpectedly, the criminal bit Zhang's left arm hard, causing Zhang to fall to the ground in extreme pain. In a flash, the criminal had already jumped onto the roof of the car, near Wangting Station, carrying the original stolen goods on the passenger car as it flew. He jumped off the carriage and escaped without a trace

False Report of Robbery Surrendered Himself

When the train arrived at Suzhou Station, Detective Chief Kang telegraphed Wangting Police Station in detail, describing the criminal's appearance and the location of the jump, and asked the police to assist in the pursuit. After receiving the report, the station was about to send someone to pursue, when suddenly a young man in a blue cloth shirt with a bloody face went to report the loss, saying that he had been robbed on the 9th train and pushed off the train by bandits. The police station thought that the clothes worn by the young man were the same as those reported by Detective Chief Kang, so they pretended to agree and immediately telegraphed Detective Chief Kang in Suzhou secretly and asked him to go to Wangting as soon as possible. Kang rushed to Wangting with Police Chief Zhang by train after receiving the report. After a secret identification, it was indeed the escaped criminal who jumped off the train, and he was immediately detained

Fatigue Interrogation Confessed Accomplices

After the criminal was arrested, he was taken to Xishi for medical treatment due to his facial injuries. After bandaging, he was escorted back to the First Section of the Xishihu Police Section. Section Chief Min Jian was selected to interrogate him using fatigue interrogation methods. The criminal then confessed that his name was Zhang Bingren, 26 years old, from Jinan, Shandong. He was the main culprit of the famous "Bengbu Gang Flying Car Party". There were a total of eight accomplices. Later, because there were no more passengers traveling to and from the Bengbu area, they went south at the end of last year and entrenched themselves in the Suxi area, specializing in stealing on night express trains. They had committed hundreds of cases. Later, the criminal was escorted to the station again, and he pointed out accomplices Yuan Liangxiao (27 years old, from Guangdong), Huang Ying (23 years old, from Guangdong), and Wang Mouhua (25 years old, from Guilin) on the spot, and they were arrested and brought back to the section. They all directly admitted to stealing by flying cars together. As for the three remaining accomplices, they had fled after hearing the news. The arrested criminals were escorted by Detective Chief Kang, and arrived in Shanghai from Xishi yesterday afternoon. The fugitives

Public Performance Jumping Car Stunt

After the four criminals arrived in Shanghai, the Police Department ordered the main criminal Zhang Bingren to publicly perform the jumping car stunt, and awarded him a package and a box. The criminal climbed onto the car as light as a swallow, and after boarding the car, his movements were as agile as a monkey. When he flipped from the carriage to the roof of the car and jumped off the roof of the car, he was safe and sound. The jumping and climbing skills are extremely skilled. The criminals will be sent to the court for strict handling after further interrogation.

### Nanhui Bloodshed: Tax Collection Official and Village Headman Murdered in the Night; Another Abducted and Missing

[Report from Our Newspaper] At approximately 2:00 AM on the 16th, more than ten bandits suddenly descended upon the home of Jin Wenxiang (age 50, currently a tax collection official for the Nanhui County government) in Xujinjia Bridge, Dongli, Xinchang Town, Nanhui County, Pudong. The bandits, all speaking in local dialects and armed with guns, positioned a few as lookouts outside while the rest forced their way into the bedroom, roused Jin Wenxiang, and dragged him outside. Simultaneously, another group of bandits circled to the back of Jin Wenxiang's house and abducted Jin Linxing as well. Within minutes, Jin Wenxiang's son, hearing two gunshots in the distance, sensed trouble. He braved the danger and followed the sound, only to find his father and another man (Ye Zuhan, the current headman of the Sixth Village in Xuanqiao Township) lying stiff and lifeless in pools of blood. Jin Linxing, however, was nowhere to be found. It is rumored that both victims were known for their integrity and were murdered because they refused to collect money and grain from villagers on behalf of the bandits.

### Ill-Fated Youth Experiences Multiple Misfortunes: Injured Under a Wheel, Seeks Treatment, but Two Hospitals are Full; Then Involved in Another Car Accident

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at approximately 12:25 PM, a black-plated sedan with the license number 15063 was speeding along the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Wenmiao Road in the Nanshi district when it ran over and seriously injured the foot of Wei Jiulian (age 16, from Shaoxing), an apprentice at a sock factory. An ambulance from the nearby West District Fire Brigade was immediately called to transport him to the hospital. However, both the Sino-American Red Cross Hospital and other hospitals were full, so he was redirected to the Shanghai Westside Zhongshan Hospital. On the way, the ambulance was involved in an accident at the intersection of Jianguo West Road and Gaoun Road when it was struck head-on by a red public bus of the French Concession's Route 22 (license number 14531, driver number 237). The ambulance was damaged, but fortunately, no one was injured. The police at the Changshu Police Station brought both parties in for investigation. It is reported that the French Concession company has admitted liability for all damages. The injured patient was transported to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment in another vehicle.

### Relief for Northern Jiangsu; Fundraising is Smooth

Wang Baoxuan, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, recently came to Shanghai with Leng Meng, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, to appeal for relief for the flood in Northern Jiangsu. In addition to visiting leaders of various Jiangsu communities in Shanghai, he returned to Zhenjiang by train last night. A reporter interviewed him to inquire about his impressions. He expressed high praise and admiration for some members of the Jiangsu community and the press in Shanghai, saying that the disaster victims in Northern Jiangsu will never forget their enthusiasm and efforts. Through consultations over the past three days, the expected amount of relief funds will reach 25 billion yuan. The UNRRA also has 1,500 tons of grain that may be transported to the disaster area for work relief, exceeding their original hopes. Wang also said that the strength of the Chinese people is truly incredibly great. Although Shanghai is the financial center of the country, all kinds of fundraising activities are aimed at Shanghai. Over the years, Shanghai has contributed greatly to society and the nation. Even regarding the disaster relief in Northern Jiangsu, this is the third time raising funds in Shanghai. Within a few days, the amount has exceeded the original target. The future of Jiangsu and the nation is truly optimistic. Wang and others will likely return to Shanghai in a few days to formally establish an organization with all parties, first borrowing 10 billion yuan from the four banks to send personnel to Northern Jiangsu for emergency relief. Wang repeatedly expressed his willingness to represent the 10 million disaster victims in Northern Jiangsu to express their deep gratitude to all sectors of Shanghai.

### Jiangwan Stadium: Visiting the New Recruit Camp; Wearing Lively and Agile Grass-Green Military Uniforms; Knowledge Level is Uniform but Lacking Spiritual Nourishment

To make the new, democratic, and free China stand tall at the pinnacle of the world and to lay the foundation for survival and freedom, national defense, and preventing external threats that have not subsided, and eliminating internal chaos, it is necessary to first establish a strong military. All young people with ambition and passion should generously and enthusiastically enlist in the military and fulfill their national obligations. As the saying goes, "A good man should be a soldier!"

In a corner of Jiangwan Road, in a sports field covering hundreds of acres, thousands of strong men who have traveled long distances from afar - the new recruits - are active. On their healthy and strong bodies, we can recognize the soul of the Chinese nation, which is kind, strong, unyielding, and resilient new life.

Visiting New Recruits Amidst the Heat

When the reporter arrived at Jiangwan Stadium, he saw groups of new recruits wearing neat, grass-green military uniforms, looking so energetic and solemn as they awaited orders from the commanding officers to arrange their new lodgings, or peacefully sitting and waiting for the doctors to give them vaccinations. It was all so natural and joyful. Cars arrived one after another. Party Secretary Fang, Assembly Speaker Pan, and Secretary-General Xie Renzhao personally braved the scorching sun to inspect the site and慰勞 (extend comfort/welfare) to the new recruits.

Port Commander General Shi Zhaoheng told reporters in a calm tone about the number of new recruits transiting through and their distribution, saying, "In the past, they were distributed in twelve locations, including Longhua, Nanshi, and Wusong. Originally, because they were going to be transported by sea to the Northeast for centralized training, there was no unified plan. But now, due to insufficient ship transport, in order to facilitate management, it was decided to use this ruin, clean it up, and use it as a resting camp for the new recruits passing through Shanghai, both north and south. At the same time, Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the food and lodging issues of the new recruits. Last time, he ordered Director Xu Siping to come to Shanghai to explain everything. The Joint Logistics Department has already transported 500 tents and 10,000 cots. It is expected that this place will be able to accommodate all the new recruits passing through Shanghai within days."

Bringing Warmth and Comfort

Because the new recruits did not have normal routines along the way, gastroenteritis is the most common ailment, followed by dysentery, malaria, and the flu. There is a fear of infectious diseases, so most of the new recruits entering the camp have been vaccinated against infectious diseases such as cholera. Most fascinating are the clean-up workers in red uniforms, the nurses in white uniforms, and the new recruits in green military uniforms, creating a red and white interspersed masterpiece. In order to provide a quiet opportunity for sick soldiers to recuperate, the former swimming pool will be used as a sanatorium and isolation ward. Efforts are currently being strengthened in environmental sanitation and disease prevention.

The drinking water problem has now been improved. After the tap water pipes are connected, showers and laundry sinks will be opened. Electrical wiring is about to be completed, which will soon bring the light and heat of the city to this place.

Speaker Pan went to visit every tent and the new recruits' lodging in the scorching sun. He happened to encounter them eating on the spot with a map. The food consisted mainly of pork, onions, peppers, and vegetables. Secretary Fang also ate a portion of rice and vegetables next to them. Because he is from Anhui, he made a special trip to the Anhui contingent to visit his fellow villagers, talking about their shared hometown. Every new recruit felt a sense of kinship. It is said that in terms of comfort/welfare activities, in order to enable the new recruits to receive the warmth and comfort of their fellow villagers, various hometown associations have been mobilized to launch comfort/welfare gatherings. Currently, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Guangxi have initiated responses.

Hoping to Read Newspapers and Magazines

I remember grabbing a small boy named Yao Lizhi, only nineteen years old, with a small stature, from the new recruits with lightning speed and asked him if he had been forced to enlist or if there were other reasons for joining. He opened his big eyes, naturally revealing a mouthful of white teeth, and crying, replied in a Hunan dialect very correctly and humorously, "I am not young anymore. Of course I can enlist in the army. Can't I voluntarily do my part for the country?" The reporter was touched by his sense of justice and almost burst into tears, and could not help but reach out and shake his hand tightly.

According to one of the officers in charge, "The level of knowledge among the new recruits is quite uniform. What they lack is spiritual nourishment. They hope to be able to read local newspapers and magazines." Regarding this, it is reported that the comfort/welfare committee and the comfort/welfare group have a whole plan for military culture. Secretary Fang said, "In the near future, loudspeakers and radio equipment will be installed on both sides of the open space to broadcast comfort/welfare programs. The existing movie theater in the sports field will be used to host performances by the city's theater guild every day, including spoken dramas, Peking opera, Yangzhou opera, Cantonese opera, Yue opera, and other programs."

In the twilight, in the hot current of the new recruits' magnificent singing, and in the passionate exchange of emotions, we left the "oasis" in the new recruits' journey. (Li Zige)

### Engineering Expert Dr. Mao Yisheng Broadcasts on the Huangpu River Crossing Project; The River Crossing Project is the Lifeline for the Prosperity of Pudong; Citizens Should Unite to Complete the Great Construction

[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper held its 20th special Sunday broadcast yesterday at the Jindu Radio Station, inviting engineering expert Dr. Mao Yisheng to broadcast on the "Huangpu River Crossing Project." The following is a summary of his speech:

The development of Shanghai started from the east bank of the Huangpu River (i.e., the Bund) and gradually spread westward for more than ten kilometers, while also developing upwards into the high-rise buildings along the Bund. However, the east bank of the Huangpu River, only five hundred meters away from the Bund, has remained completely still, maintaining its state from a hundred years ago. The disparity across the river is so great. What is the reason for this? The reason is very clear: it is due to the concessions. The west side of the Huangpu River had concessions, so it prospered. The east side of the Huangpu River had no concessions, so it declined. This is indeed a tragic historical fact. Although Shanghai ranks sixth among the world's major cities on the surface, it inevitably diminishes its luster.

Tunnels are the Most Reasonable, but the Cost is Enormous

Fortunately, after the victory, the Shanghai municipal authorities immediately thought of developing Pudong after taking over Shanghai and established the Shanghai River Crossing Project Committee to study and promote the plan for this river crossing project. Now, I will briefly report on the results of this study.

The term "river crossing project" originated from the River Crossing Project Committee. It refers to projects that cross the Huangpu River. Such projects can be bridges in the air, floating bridges made of boats on the water surface, or tunnels underground. All of these are technically feasible. With this river crossing project, Pudong will gradually become as prosperous as Puxi. Isn't this river crossing project the lifeline of Pudong, just as the Huangpu River is the lifeline of Shanghai?

Unfortunately, these two lifelines have some conflicts. The river crossing project needs to cross the Huangpu River, and the Huangpu River is constantly busy with ships of all sizes day and night. If this river crossing project hinders the water traffic on the Huangpu River, then Pudong will not benefit, and Shanghai will suffer first! Therefore, the plan for this river crossing project must prioritize maintaining water traffic on the Huangpu River, and floating bridges made of boats on the water surface are not worth considering. This leads to the study of the advantages and disadvantages of tunnels and bridges. Tunnels are the most ideal river crossing projects, but the construction costs are extremely high. At today's prices, building a two-lane tunnel with a 4% grade would probably cost as much as 500 billion yuan.

High Bridges are Difficult to Realize, Low Bridges are a Compromise

As for bridges, there are high bridges and low bridges. High bridges are designed to allow the largest ships to pass under the bridge, which means that there must be a clearance of more than one hundred feet above the water surface. The construction cost of the bridge itself is considerable, but the most difficult thing is that such a high bridge requires extremely long bridge approaches to reach from the ground. Assuming that this high bridge crosses the river from the Bund of Zhongzheng Road, then the starting point of the bridge approach would almost need to extend to the Great World. Only then can all vehicles safely get on the bridge. Such a long bridge approach not only costs a lot to build and affects the surrounding real estate, but also requires going from the Bund back to the Great World to get on the bridge, which is a waste of time. Therefore, high bridges on the Huangpu River are also difficult to realize. As for low bridges, they are a compromise. When large ships pass under the bridge, a section of the bridge can be opened, changing from a horizontal position to a vertical position, leaving a section of waterway for the ships to pass through. Opening and closing this movable bridge only takes one and a half minutes each time, which is certainly inconvenient for vehicular traffic on the bridge, but it does not require very long bridge approaches, so the construction cost is much lower than high bridges and also cheaper than tunnels. Comparing the prices of the same period, it only accounts for a quarter of the construction cost of tunnels.

How to Raise Funds

Several Questions Arise

The above-mentioned three types of river crossing projects—tunnels, high bridges, and low bridges—each have their technical difficulties, but all are feasible. Economically, how to raise funds? It should be possible to raise funds from two sources: toll fees and land appreciation fees. However, there are several prerequisites: (1) Currently, there is ferry traffic across the Huangpu River. When will the ferry become strained and insufficient to meet the needs of crossing the river, prompting the realization of the river crossing project? (2) Currently, Pudong has not yet been developed. The biggest reason for this is the economic imbalance in the country. When will everyone come to Pudong to build? If Pudong is not developed, can the transportation across the river still increase? (3) In modern cities, the construction of bridges and tunnels is a productive undertaking and never relies on government subsidies. However, if Shanghai launches this river crossing project and issues bonds, how will Shanghai citizens trust it? Can it be compared to other international cities? How many people are willing to invest in such bonds instead of buying gold and US dollars? (4) The river crossing project is a part of the overall urban plan of Greater Shanghai. In order to realize the river crossing project, other related plans must also proceed to the same extent so that they can coordinate with each other. Otherwise, even if there is a river crossing project, but Pudong has not been developed at the same time, wouldn't this project be a losing business?

If the Plan is Realized, it Will be an Honor for Every Citizen

Judging from this, it seems that the Huangpu River crossing project does not have much hope at present. But Shanghai has more than five million citizens and is one of the six largest cities in the world. Among all the urban plans of Greater Shanghai, this river crossing project is the greatest and most arduous construction. If the citizens of Shanghai can unite to shoulder this great construction, starting with the most difficult, and serve as a model for urban construction in the country, one day when the citizens of Shanghai can leisurely walk across the Huangpu River, the past history of Shanghai will become the glory of every citizen!

### Special Broadcast Program

[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper held a special all-day Sunday broadcast yesterday at the Jindu Radio Station. In addition to inviting engineering expert Dr. Mao Yisheng to broadcast on the "Huangpu River Crossing Project," the full-day program is listed below: Starting at 9:00 AM, Dr. Zhong Zhihe spoke on "The Rampancy of Autumn Cholera," Zhao Mingsu spoke on "Great Love," the Lele Friendship Society sang songs, and Chen Fanwo spoke on "Women's Clothing and Food During Pregnancy." In the afternoon, Wang Qinglong performed a harmonica solo, Miss Bao Hanying told children's stories, Lawyer Mi Xitong spoke on "First Instance Litigation Procedures," and Dr. Wang Juerong spoke on "The Prevention and Treatment of痧子 (a type of skin disease)." From 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, all members of the Xianni Society broadcast and sang five excerpts from famous Kunqu operas, including "Recognizing the Son," "Going to the Meeting Alone," "Red Maid Sending a Letter," and "Going Down the Mountain." The society is the main base of Kunqu opera in Shanghai, and their singing is naturally extraordinary. Therefore, during the broadcast, listeners from other provinces made long-distance calls to request Zhu Mingjun to sing "Touring the Garden." In order to respond to this kind request, we specially invited Zhu to sing the song again. From 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM, we specially invited teachers and students from the Xiasheng Drama School to broadcast and sing Peking opera, including "Fishing and Killing the Family" performed by young students from the school: Hu Shunxing, 罷通明 (name unknown), Zhang Xinde, Lin Xumin, Liu Zhaobo, Liu Zhaoxin, and Gan Zhenyang. Guo Jianying (school director), and students Liu Zhifa and Zhao Tingyuan performed "Imperial Concubine Assassinating the Tiger." Liu Zhongqiu (principal) and Ma Zhenkui (professor) performed "Beating the Stick and Leaving the Box." The school was established in Xi'an in July of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) and has performed many times in Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places. After the victory, when the government returned to the capital, it traveled east along the Yangtze River, performing in major cities and receiving praise everywhere. In the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), it moved to Shanghai and gave a short performance at the China Grand Theater, which was very well received. This time, at the invitation of this newspaper, all the teachers and students came out to broadcast excellent plays, and their enthusiasm is especially commendable.

### Dispute on the Tram Causes Traffic Obstruction on the Bund

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 11:45 AM yesterday morning, two soldiers boarded a tram on the British Route 2 as it passed through the Bund of Nanjing Road. A misunderstanding occurred with the conductor, leading to a conflict. Eventually, the two sides resorted to violence, resulting in minor injuries. At that time, trams were connected on the way, causing traffic obstruction. The police station and the Tram Company Industry Union dispatched personnel to the scene to mediate. The injured soldiers were sent to the hospital, and the tram resumed operation at 1:30 PM in the afternoon.

### Savage Skies, Brave Warriors Endure Peril: American Investigation Deep into Valleys, Searching for Lost Loyal Bones and Wreckage

[Special Correspondent Zhou Xueduan, Chengdu, 12th] One recalls that during the most difficult phase of the War of Resistance, a great miracle - the Sino-American cooperation in flying the Hump - created a new lifeline for China at the time, laying the foundation for the final victory. In order to fly the Hump, countless loyal souls were buried in foreign cities and among chaotic mountains and countless peaks. After the victory, the American government also repeatedly sent teams to scout and search for loyal bones in foreign cities. Each time they went deep into barbarian areas, it was full of adventure. This is a piece of adventure history that a reporter obtained from a brave warrior who recently returned with the American army from a perilous journey.

Amidst Chaotic Mountains

Where Heroes' Bones Rest

In 1944, to accomplish the great feat of flying the Hump, countless loyal remains were shattered in India, the Himalayas, and the chaotic mountains of Sichuan, Kang, and Tibet. After the victory, the American government repeatedly sent teams into the mountains to search for loyal bones and wreckage, but without success. This May, after a long period of research, the American military authorities determined that possibly nine aircraft had crashed within the borders of Sichuan and Kang. Based on research of the areas through which the flight routes passed at the time, they dispatched Lieutenant Hangerland to lead a team to Sichuan to investigate. In late May, Lieutenant Han arrived in Chengdu and requested assistance from the Sichuan provincial authorities. The Sichuan-Kang Pacification Headquarters sent Adjutant Li Changjie, a translator, to accompany them and travel to Maogong via Xikang to search.

Peril in Deep Mountains

Ambushed by Bandits

In early June, this investigation team began its arduous journey, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, step by step delving into barbarian regions. In the border area between Sichuan and Kang, all are "barren lands" inhabited by both Han and Yi peoples. High mountains rise abruptly, chaotic currents run rampant, cliffs are tens of thousands of feet high, and precipices are a thousand *jian* high. The majority of the people are semi-civilized Lolo, Qiang, and Mosuo peoples, and a small number are stubborn Han Chinese. This is the "outer realm" of Sichuan and Kang, and also a paradise for a few adventurers - and a forbidden zone for those who traffic in and cultivate opium. In deep mountain valleys or on vast grasslands, *huanfu* often lurk, and bandits appear and disappear. They searched exhaustively in these high mountains, steep ridges, deep forests, and secluded valleys for more than a month, enduring all kinds of hardships. On July 19, they arrived in the forests of Dabao Mountain between Ganba and Kangding in Kang province, when suddenly a large number of bandits armed with guns and single-edged weapons ambushed them, and a fierce encounter battle unfolded on the spot. However, because the bandits were numerous and their guns were sharp, and the investigation team was outnumbered and outgunned, Adjutant Li was seriously injured, and five members of the Xikang security team escorting them were killed. Fortunately, the American investigation team suffered no casualties. They immediately led their troops down halfway up the mountain and defended the stone wall, finally relying on the arrival of reinforcements to repel the bandits.

Plateau Grasslands

Completing the Initial Task

In late July, the investigation team entered the possible crash zone, which is the southwestern and northwestern border area of Sichuan, belonging to the plateau grasslands, where Tibetan and Lolo people engage in nomadic activities. The Jinsha River and the Yalong, Anning, and Huitong Rivers flow from north to south, forming deep canyons with an elevation of about three thousand feet, surrounded by large and small snow mountains, and high peaks such as the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains, and the Greater and Lesser Xiang Mountains. The climate of the plateau in the middle of the grassland is cold, with wild grass stretching for miles. Two-thirds of the residents are Yi people, who are brutal in nature and fierce in customs, regarding murder and robbery as commonplace, and are known as "Yi bandits." When the investigation team arrived, because the area was full of steep ridges and a necessary place for navigation, they proceeded cautiously, conducting careful reconnaissance. In dangerous places where high peaks entered the clouds and cliffs stood, with no road to pass through, they hammered ropes and descended to explore, going to great pains. Finally, on July 27, on the mountainside of Muerzhai Village, Dawei Township, Maogong, they found the wreckage of a B29 transport aircraft that had flown from India to Sichuan on the night of July 7, 1944, and crashed into the mountain at that location. The heroes who died in the aircraft had already been buried. After the initial completion of the mission, Lieutenant Han has telegraphed the American government and is now conducting further search work. After the reporter heard this brave wounded hero's adventure story, I deeply admired the great feats of modern society and the ancient Middle Ages, looked up at the savage skies and barbarian clouds, and wished them a successful return.

### River and Mountain Heroes! Chuxian Representatives Commemorate the Fallen Soldiers of Menglianggu

[Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua, Nanjing, 15th] "August 13th" is a most somber anniversary. The 74th Division chose this day to commemorate the fallen soldiers who died in the suppression of bandits at Menglianggu. Thinking deeply about the pain, what profound and deep significance this holds! On this day, the city of Chuxian was filled with sorrow. The entire city fasted, as if mourning the death of a parent. The blood-soaked pennants further shed infinite tears for the loyal and brave martyrs! Chairman Chiang's representative, Senior Staff Officer Yang, came. Commander Wang Yaowu's representative, Deputy Commander Zheng, came. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo's representative, Chief of Staff Liu, came. When these senior officers heard the roars of their subordinates who heroically sacrificed themselves at Menglianggu, they could not sleep or eat in peace. Especially Zhang Lingfu, this brave general, they really couldn't help but come in person to participate today. However, that heart, that tear, we can imagine would be even more difficult and sad than personally walking to the spirits of the fallen soldiers.

Chuxian Middle School was temporarily used as the venue for the memorial service, the arrangement was solemn, and sadness was especially felt.

More than a thousand couplets

coincidentally regarded them as "Zhang Suiyang" and "Yue Wumu" of today. This was really not accidental. Chairman Chiang personally wrote "River and Mountain Heroes" and "Magnificent Righteousness." President Yu personally wrote "Great Knowledge, Great Benevolence, Great Courage." Chen Lifu personally wrote "Crimson Blood and Loyal Heart." All of them raised their eyebrows and breathed a sigh of relief for the fallen soldiers of Menglianggu.

In a somber atmosphere, Senior Staff Officer Yang, representing Chairman Chiang, read his message of condolence to the loyal and brave soldiers of the 74th Division. Next was Commander Zheng, representing Commander Wang Yaowu, giving instructions. Because Commander Wang had a special relationship with the 74th Division, his emotions and his grief were deeper than anyone else's. He said: "The 74th Division is a unit that is most dear and familiar to me. I once nurtured, educated, and cultivated it like an infant. Although it has left me in recent years, its growth, its development, and its achievements are still what I am most concerned about, and what I am happy to hear about.

In a rare opportunity, the reporter also interviewed Madam Zhang,

Ms. Wang Yuling

. At this time, her tears were still streaming down. The reporter took the opportunity to comfort her. After a while, she said to the reporter with sorrow: "He died, sacrificing himself for the country. This is supreme glory, but what is left to me is Shaoling, who is not yet half a year old, and an unbearable memory." Tears streamed down again. After a while, she slowly continued to say to the reporter: "Lingfu has lived up to the country, and the country has lived up to Lingfu in remembrance of this sacrifice. For me personally, it is unfortunate, but for the country and the nation, it is great. For a month and a half, I have been constantly grieving. Suddenly, one day, I saw in the newspaper the news that Chairman Chiang had bestowed the name "Lingfu" on a warship. How happy I was! The dead Lingfu seemed to be by my side. He didn't steal a life, so he died as heavy as Mount Tai. His wife, his son, and even his friends and classmates naturally regarded it as supreme glory." Then she said: "Lingfu will not let down the country, and I will absolutely not let down Lingfu. I have the courage to be progressive. I will raise Shaoling and invigorate myself even more. I will continue to encourage myself deeply, because I have only received a secondary education. If I am to live up to Lingfu, then I must continue my studies, inherit Lingfu's legacy, and do my part for the country. At the same time, I can comfort Lingfu's spirit in heaven. Shaoling is a lovely son, and he looks very much like his father. I hope to do my best to make him a talented person. Although I dare not compare myself to Mother Meng, I hope that Shaoling will become a Mencius." Madam Zhang is such an accomplished woman. The reporter deeply admired her in her heart. Finally, she told the reporter: "Division Commander Zhang is a typical soldier. I understand him best. I want to practice my writing and write a novel for him to commemorate him!" She said very happily: "This responsibility is too great. I will have to ask you and the press for a lot of help in the future!"

### Twists and Turns, Nearly Stillborn: Zhengzhou Agricultural Machinery Company Announced Its Establishment

[Special Correspondent Fan Shiqin, Zhengzhou, 11th] The Zhengzhou Agricultural Machinery Company, which the UNRRA General Headquarters has long hoped to facilitate, was established here on the 11th. However, at the time of delivery, various twists and turns occurred, almost resulting in a stillbirth. The company's capital was originally set at 2 billion yuan, with 1 billion yuan invested by four banks, 200 million yuan by the Henan Provincial Bank, 150 million yuan invested by 13 counties in public land at discounted prices, 100 million yuan by the Kaifeng Far East Enterprise Company, 100 million yuan by local people, and 630 million yuan by people from Xinxiang. At the inaugural meeting, the Xinxiang group suddenly announced their withdrawal. It is said that this group had previously submitted a list of directors, supervisors, and managers, etc., which was not accepted by the public, so they left in anger. The nature of the company is based on the principle of private operation, so there were also major disputes over the issue of equity arising from the investment of various banks. The banks believed that the investment of the banks was of an assisting nature, and that the banks could withdraw at any time in the future when local people increased their shares, but that there should be some limit to the current restriction of equity. However, the general local people advocated that the equity of each bank should be included within one unit, and that the equity should be calculated at 80% of the price for every 111 shares up to 100 shares, 70% of the price for every 101 shares up to 300 shares, and 60% of the price for every 201 shares up to 300 shares. As a result, the former followed the banks' proposal, and the latter followed the local people's proposal. Another twist was that Liu Chunnong, one of the elected directors, paid the money before the inaugural meeting, but the money had not yet been transferred to the account

### Heroes of the Flood Zone: Collectively Rescuing Food in the Water

[Special Correspondent Zong Chunlin, Xuzhou, 14th] The flood in northern Jiangsu this summer is unprecedented in 70 years. The disaster situation in Pi, Xiao, Tong, Xi, and Feng counties is particularly severe. The entire territory is submerged, and the autumn crops have all entered the water. The victims have no clothes or food and are in urgent need of relief. Huang Zanyao, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, went to Pi County last Wednesday to investigate the disaster. When the car arrived at Bachaji, all he saw was a water sky, and the farmers' hopes for everything they had worked hard for all year were submerged by the water. The sorghum spikes were still struggling to lower their heads on the water surface. Soybeans, cotton, and other low-stalked plants rarely showed above the water surface. The further east he went, the more severe the flood became. Because of the obstruction of the Xuhai Highway, the flood rolled south at the speed of lettuce. The highway was submerged. Zhao * blank * was one of the most severely affected areas. Some time ago, when the water had not receded, the railways were all submerged. Thousands of refugees who fled from the water villages had grief carved on their faces and suffering recorded on their foreheads. The elderly wept incessantly, and the survivors were so sad that they could not bear it!

Sailing to Dayushu, in the vast ocean, looking out at the submerged fields and the half-submerged villages, was like a boat looking at small birds in the sea. Two hundred years ago, Dayushu was just a tree and two families, which slowly multiplied and have now become a large town with hundreds of households. However, the Dayushu was sold out during the War of Resistance and used as firewood. The Yunhe Rural Normal School, which cultivated countless talents before the war, now has all its houses in the water and its school buildings have also been destroyed.

A group of refugees, they collectively rescued the food in the water, tightly united together, and everyone ate the grain. One of the middle-aged men used a large door panel to push a bag of wet grain, floating on the water. He himself swam in the water, flipping the door panel, and traveled fifteen miles. We admire this hero of the disaster area

The sun was setting quickly. The black hands of the refugees, like charcoal sticks, threw the sorghum *blank* and devoured them hungrily. According to County Magistrate Wang Tianzhong, although the water level has dropped by three feet, it is still a water sky and the disaster is unabated. Needless to say next spring, in a month and a half, the terror of hunger will threaten the entire Pi County and more than three million disaster victims in northern Jiangsu.

### Shandong University Test Leak: Zhao Tai Mou Declares Not True

[Reported by this newspaper, Qingdao, 17th] Regarding the Shandong University test leak, according to the school president Zhao Tai Mou: On the afternoon of the 12th, the Physics and Chemistry test questions for the last session of the freshman exam at Shandong University were discovered by students of the school before the exam started. After investigation, the first four questions were the same as the prepared alternative questions. Since the school prepares two sets of test questions, primary and alternative, the exam was not affected. Subsequently, after the exam had started, students discovered that a part of the primary questions had been copied. At that time, some examinees had already finished the exam and left the venue, so it cannot be concluded that there was a leak beforehand. It was decided to investigate the truth on the one hand, in order to investigate and deal with it, and on the other hand, to evaluate the exam papers to see how the results were, as supporting evidence. The Qingdao district exam papers have now been graded, and the general results are not good, with no special signs that can prove a leak. The rumor about stealing and selling sealed test papers is impossible due to the strict procedures for preparing the papers, and there are no facts supporting such slanderous behavior.

[Reported by this newspaper, Qingdao, 16th] The discovery of the Shandong University freshman entrance exam test leak is as follows: The 12th was the day of the freshman exam. At 1:30 pm, two students from the Foreign Languages Department of the school, Liang Peilang and Li Junchao, were taking a walk and discovered that the incoming freshmen were gathering to copy the questions. They immediately seized a copy of the copied Physics and Chemistry questions and reported it to Dean of Academic Affairs, Yang Zhaolian. It was confirmed that they were the same as the alternative Physics and Chemistry questions for Group B at 2 pm that afternoon. The two students, under the instruction of Dean Yang, continued to pay attention and discovered the aforementioned copying of questions, that the copied questions were the same as the primary questions. For a time, everyone was shocked, and the "Democracy Wall" became quite lively. President Zhao Tai Mou returned to Qingdao from Shanghai on the 13th. He stated that he would thoroughly investigate. If there is evidence, he will submit it to the school affairs meeting to decide on a method for re-examination, or take other remedial measures, and ask all students to assist in finding clues and collecting evidence to jointly investigate.

### Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball Tournament Concludes: Yongsha Friendship Association Wins Championship; Huayan Friendship Team Ranks Second in Men's and Women's Divisions

[Reported by this newspaper] The second Guo Zhen Cup volleyball tournament, hosted by the Municipal Stadium, concluded successfully last night. In the women's division, the Friendship Association defeated the Friendship Team two to zero, winning the championship with six wins in six games. In the men's final, Yongsha defeated Huayan three to zero, winning the championship. More than a thousand spectators attended, a rare spectacle for volleyball games.

The Friendship Association's captain, Chen Meizhen, performed the best, staying in the middle of the front row, spiking and closing the door, making the opponent helpless. The Friendship Team's Huang Mingyuan worked harder, but had few opportunities and could hardly show her strengths. The newlywed Liu Zhenbao stayed in the front row of the Friendship Team. Yongsha's three generals, Chen Yiquan, Guo Douzhao, and Xu Heng, were like dragons and tigers, and often made outstanding contributions in tight and dangerous situations. Huayan's third row was slightly weak, and the opponent took the opportunity to attack. However, the four men's and women's teams last night were all first-class strong teams in Shanghai, and their performances were wonderful, which the fans marveled at. After the game, awards were given on the spot. The champion received the Mayor's Silver Cup, and the Municipal Stadium gave each team member a medal. The runner-up, Huayan Friendship Team, was given a pennant by the Municipal Stadium.

Friendship Association vs. Friendship Team

Starting at 6:30, the Friendship Team's spike fell outside the court, and the Friendship Association had a stronger momentum. After a 2-2 tie, they went downstream and switched sides at 11-3. The Friendship Team fought hard, but still could not resist their sharp edge. Wang Shan once again jumped up to spike and close the door, and the score gradually increased. The Friendship Association won the first game 21-18. The Friendship Team's luck turned for the better, and it became a seesaw battle. The Friendship Team took the lead 11-9. The Friendship Association chased back to a 14-14 tie, and finally made an effort. The Friendship Association won the Friendship Team again 21-16. Referee: Zhang Le.

### Minister of Finance Yu and Governor Zhang Issue Written Statements: Prices of Daily Necessities Will Not Change

[Our Newspaper Report] Minister of Finance Yu and Governor Zhang of the Central Bank issued written statements on the revision of the Foreign Exchange Management and Import and Export Trade Measures, which are recorded as follows:

Minister Yu's Statement

Since the government announced the Measures for the Management of Import and Export Trade in November of last year, import and export trade has improved slightly compared to the past. However, as the difference between the official exchange rate and the market price has increased daily, exports are still difficult, overseas remittances are evaded, and smuggling of goods is becoming more rampant, which has a significant impact on the balance of international payments and the national economy, and urgently needs to be remedied. All remedial measures have been carefully studied by the government. After close examination by the State Council, the revised Interim Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange and the Measures for Import and Export Trade have been passed and put into practice. Under these measures, the Central Bank will continue to supply foreign exchange at the current official exchange rate for essential goods such as cotton, rice, wheat, flour, fertilizer, and coal. The foreign exchange needed for other imported goods and various legitimate foreign exchange needs will be paid by the Central Bank and designated banks using export foreign exchange and remittances from overseas Chinese, all calculated at market prices. In order to balance the supply and demand of foreign exchange and stabilize exchange rates, the government has specially established a Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to take charge of this responsibility. It is believed that after the implementation of these measures, the prices of daily necessities will not change significantly. The situation of exported goods and remittances from overseas Chinese can be improved compared to the past, which will greatly benefit the balance of international payments and the national economy. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will share the difficulties and enthusiastically assist the government in achieving its goals.

Governor Zhang's Statement

Our government's foreign exchange policy has always focused on stabilizing the foreign exchange market, hoping to maintain the stability of the general economy through the stability of foreign exchange. Since the foreign exchange adjustment in February to 12,000 national currency per US dollar, the officially set exchange rate has lost its effect due to the continued rise in domestic prices and rampant speculation. As a result, exports and overseas remittances have decreased, and the government's foreign exchange income has decreased. On the other hand, although import merchants and manufacturing industries have obtained low exchange rates to transport goods, most items are still sold at black market prices, from which they obtain excessive profits. As the government's foreign exchange income has decreased, it has had to gradually reduce the amount of foreign exchange settled at official prices, which has naturally had a considerable impact on legitimate businesses. Most of the foreign exchange has fallen into the hands of smugglers, and consumers have not received any benefit, leading to stagnation in business. In view of this, the government believes that it is necessary to revise the measures for foreign exchange and import and export management. According to the revised measures, the Central Bank will supply official exchange rates for daily necessities whose prices can be controlled by the government, such as cotton, rice, wheat, flour, coal, and coking coal. The remaining approved imports and financial payments will be settled and sold by designated banks at market prices, and foreign exchange obtained from exports and overseas remittances can also be sold to designated banks at market prices at market prices. According to precise estimates, except for the above-mentioned bulk daily necessities that are still settled by the government at official prices, the remaining amounts of exports, imports, receipts, and payments can be offset against each other. Therefore, after the implementation of the revised measures, the foreign exchange market is expected to gradually stabilize. The government is still concerned that imports and exports cannot always be offset against each other due to different seasons or other reasons, and will establish a Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to prevent violent fluctuations in exchange rates. After the implementation of the revised measures, it is hoped that exports and remittances can be increased, and imports will continue to be strictly controlled, so that the balance of international payments can gradually be balanced. If the government's foreign exchange resources are sufficient, legitimate businesses will naturally improve day by day. The world is currently short of US dollars, and our country must prepare for a rainy day by increasing foreign exchange sources and saving foreign exchange, and striving to win overseas markets. In recent months, many industrial, commercial, and people's organizations and economic experts have advocated similar opinions, which the government has carefully considered and decided to adopt. However, the success or failure of all measures depends on the cooperation of the people. These measures have been adopted with public opinion, and it is expected that they will be supported by the public. It is hoped that export merchants will not take advantage of the more favorable market exchange rate to compete and raise prices, which will affect overseas markets and cause exports to decline again. It is also hoped that import merchants will not take advantage of the existence of market exchange rates to hoard and raise prices. It must be known that the purchasing power of the Chinese people is limited, and excessively high prices will inevitably lead to reduced sales and business depression. This is very clear and should be understood. Finally, there is a comforting matter, that is, our country's negotiations with the Hong Kong government on trade and foreign exchange issues have been successfully resolved. The Hong Kong government has made a separate statement, and the conclusion of this agreement is of great benefit to the common interests of both China and Hong Kong. It is also helpful to the implementation of these revised measures. I am deeply grateful for the cooperation spirit of the Hong Kong government.

### State Council Resolution

### Chinese Plant Oil Factory Sends Personnel to Inspect Major Products of Taiwan Province - Wang Longsheng Discusses His Trip to Taiwan and Thoughts Upon His Return - Camphor Exports Have Stalled

The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Chinese Plant Oil Factory, considering the shortage of fertilizer in Taiwan Province and the insufficient fertilizer production in various countries after the war, as well as the fact that various countries are purchasing it, leading to extreme scarcity, sent Wang Longsheng, manager of its Shanghai office, to Taiwan in mid-May to inspect various locations. In addition to seeking ways to promote the sale of "Zhi" brand soybean cakes, he also paid attention to the export situation of the province's major products. Mr. Wang has completed his mission in Taiwan and returned to Shanghai last week. He stated his experiences and thoughts on the trip, saying that in the past, the factory's soybean cakes were sold locally in Shanghai, so Taiwanese people were not familiar with the factory's "Zhi" brand soybean cakes. In order to promote regular and large-scale sales in the future, close attention should be paid to the province. In the past, Taiwan needed 200,000 tons of soybean cakes annually, mostly directly shipped from Dalian in the Northeast. Now, due to the reduced supply from the Northeast and the slightly higher prices, farmers cannot afford it, resulting in a significant decrease in consumption.

Production Overview

Regarding the current situation of major products in Taiwan Province, Mr. Wang stated: "The camphor factory still has about 400 to 500 tons of improved B-grade camphor, refined camphor, camphor flakes, and camphor tablets. It can produce 60 tons per month thereafter, but no more than 720 tons per year, which is still two times lower than the highest production before the war. Camphor exports have almost come to a standstill in the past six months. However, European countries cannot regularly rely on our country's camphor supply and have to use artificial camphor from other sources. It is recently heard that artificial camphor factories in Germany and other places have resumed operation, producing in large quantities, with prices at US$0.70 per pound, almost half the price of products from Taiwan Province. This is a major threat to Taiwan's camphor exports. (2) Taiwan Province produces raw materials for cosmetics, with the most famous being fragrant oils, such as those derived from camphor oil, including Saffa oil, Eucalyptus oil, and Fang oil. The first two are sold to European countries, and the latter can be sold to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. Saffa oil can produce 10 tons per month, and Eucalyptus oil and Fang oil can each produce 5 tons. In addition, there is also citronella oil, which is also a good export product. This year, Taiwan Province is expected to produce less than 15,000 Taiwan jin, leading to a situation of demand exceeding supply. Shanghai merchants are competing to purchase it, and the oil price has risen from NT$450 to over NT$600 per Taiwan jin. (3) Regarding the current situation of pineapple production, the world's most famous pineapple producers are Hawaii, Malaya, and Taiwan. Taiwanese products are not as good as Hawaiian products in quality, but the price is cheaper. Malayan products are cheaper than Taiwanese products, but the quality is not as high as Taiwan Province. Recently, due to the lack of tinplate in our country, canned raw materials are scarce, affecting pineapple exports. Before the war, the highest annual production was 1.6 million boxes, mostly exported. This year's expected volume is 100,000 boxes, each box worth about 300,000 National Currency. The value of can manufacturing accounts for about 45% of the total cost, which is something that urgently needs attention."

Industrial Revival

Mr. Wang concluded his observations from his trip to Taiwan by stating that after the restoration, various petroleum, mineral, and industrial enterprises in Taiwan, such as oil refineries, oil mines, aluminum companies, and copper mining companies, were taken over by the Resources Commission. Other important industries, such as sugar companies, machinery shipbuilding companies, electricity, alkali industry, cement, paper, and fertilizer companies, were also jointly operated by the Commission and the Provincial Government. The situation is very good, and most of them have been repaired and started operation. Currently, the sugar company has the largest scale and business volume. According to its original plan, it plans to increase production to 500,000 tons next year, which would be worth a total of US$250 million if each ton is priced at US$500. Currently, various industrial conditions in Taiwan Province, such as electricity, labor, building materials, and chemical equipment, are much cheaper than in Shanghai. It is most ideal for starting factories. Taiwan Province has a population of about 6.5 million, and the largest port is Keelung, which can accommodate ocean-going vessels of 10,000 to 20,000 tons. If the central authorities can improve the current import and export measures and promote active trade, Taiwan Province will undoubtedly be one of the most important commercial centers. The annual demand for fertilizer, cotton, and cotton textiles in the province, as well as the export of sugar, tea, camphor, pineapples, and other goods, is considerable and worthy of attention.

### National Cotton Production Survey Statistics

The Yarn Association Decides to Publish in Three Installments

[This Newspaper Report] The 21st joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the National Yarn Mill Association was held yesterday afternoon from 4:30 pm in the conference room of the China Textile Construction Company. Fifteen or sixteen directors and supervisors attended, chaired by Dong Yunzhang, and adjourned around 7:00 pm.

The meeting yesterday reported the following matters: (1) The national cotton production survey statistics for this year were decided to be published in three installments on August 31, October 20, and December 20 of this year. (2) The general survey of spindles and looms in national yarn mills is now mostly ready and will be published soon. (3) District associations have been established one after another in various districts, including District 1 (Chongqing), District 2 (Shaanxi), District 3 (Kunming), District 6 (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui), District 7 (Tianjin), District 8 (Hankou), and District 9 (Qingdao). Currently, after the establishment of the Northeast District Association, district associations will have been organized nationwide.

Discussion Items: (1) It was decided to convene a three-day general meeting of members of the National Yarn Mill Association in Shanghai starting on September 20 of this year to re-elect directors and supervisors. Wu Weijing, Rong Erren, Liu Piji, and Xi Wangshu, among others, were nominated to form a general meeting preparatory committee, with Wu Weijing as the convener. (2) Regarding donations for the floods in Liangguang and northern Jiangsu, the Sixth District Association plans to contribute 25 billion yuan. (3) Considering that the textile industry occupies a very important position in industry, it was resolved to submit the following two points to the Executive Yuan: (a) The National Economic Commission should include two textile industry representatives to facilitate liaison during decision-making. (b) The textile industry should have at least five seats in the business inspection delegation to Japan.

### Northeast Remittance Increased

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Northeast remittance was previously regulated by the Northeast Administrative Committee, stipulating that the remittance for each person per month should not exceed 30,000 Northeast circulating notes. Now, due to rising prices, 30,000 circulating notes are insufficient to meet actual needs. The post office has now been approved to increase it to 100,000 circulating notes. According to the current ratio of 12 National Currency to 1 circulating note, it is equivalent to approximately 1.2 million National Currency.

### Silk Goods Prices Soar

Yesterday, after the announcement of selling foreign exchange at market prices, the silk goods market, although it was Sunday, was unusually excited. Quilt fabrics jumped by 1 million yuan. Huaqiang goods reached a maximum of 11.7 million yuan, 120,000 to 130,000 yuan higher than Huaqiang goods. Plaid crepe was quoted at around 37,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. The asking prices for other goods were 5% to 10% higher, but both buyers and sellers were waiting to see, and transactions were very rare.

### Cigarette Market Sentiment Rises

Yesterday, the cigarette market, although it was Sunday, was quite excited. This was because after the government announced improvements in foreign exchange management, there were various speculations. Cigarette raw materials are considered non-essential goods, and it was feared that the cost would be affected by calculating it at the black market exchange rate later, so cargo owners were waiting to see. Taking advantage of this, speculators raised prices, and market sentiment soared.

Ten-pack British cigarettes reached a new high of 12.7 million, closing at 1.65 million at noon, up 650,000 from the previous day. Old Blade also rose by 370,000 to 8.8 million yuan. Hadamen rose by 350,000 to 7.75 million yuan. Popular goods from Chinese factories, such as Beauty, Great Cyrus, Hundred Gold, and Brandy, rose sharply. All Green Double Axe alone remained stable. However, there were many resales after the close, and the market sentiment showed a softening trend.

### Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Coal Mines Request Three Points from the Government

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 17th] The Coal Mine Industry Association of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has been established and recently submitted the following requests to the government: (1) Provide loans to help expand equipment to increase production. (2) Employees in the coal mining industry should be allowed to defer military service. (3) Order railway and shipping agencies to prioritize the transportation of coal to alleviate the coal shortage.

### Sichuan Business Community Prepares for Trade with Japan

[This Newspaper, Chengdu, 17th] Amidst the opening of trade with Japan, the Sichuan business community is actively preparing for exports to Japan. The Sichuan Handicraft Industry Federation convened a general meeting on the 17th and decided to improve products and prepare to export Sichuan specialties, with silk as the main export to Japan. Jianye has prepared a plan to increase autumn cocoon production by 35 million dan in Nanchong and other places.

### Local Tin Foil Production Sufficient to Meet Cigarette Factory Demand

[This Newspaper Report] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, with the equipment of local factories, the monthly production of tin foil can reach 20,000 boxes, which can be used to package 120,000 boxes of cigarettes. The total production volume of local cigarette factories averages about 100,000 boxes per month, and the total production volume in other areas is estimated by the tin foil industry to be about 20% of the local volume. Therefore, local production is sufficient to meet the monthly demand for tin foil by cigarette factories nationwide. Currently, in addition to using tin foil for packaging, some cigarette factories also use aluminum foil. This aluminum foil comes from abroad, and the Hua Aluminum Steel Factory of the local Swiss merchant also produces a large quantity. However, the aluminum blocks used as raw materials still need to be imported from abroad. Using aluminum foil or tin foil to package cigarettes only serves to prevent moisture. Compared to the two, tin foil may be superior. At a time when foreign exchange is in short supply, cigarette factories should switch to using domestically produced tin foil, which can not only avoid unnecessary consumption of foreign exchange but also maintain the sustainability of our country's tin foil industry.

### National Bank Initiates Organization of National Income Research Association

[This Newspaper Report] The statistics of national income are extremely important for economic research and policy decisions. National income, capital accumulation, and international balance of payments are the basic figures required by a country for economic decision-making. In order to provide accurate statistical data on national income to meet the needs of economic decision-making, the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank has initiated the organization of the Joint Statistical Research Committee on National Income in China. It has obtained the approval of relevant agencies such as the Ministries of Finance, Economics, Agriculture and Forestry, Food, Interior Affairs, Transportation, and Social Affairs, as well as the Resources Commission and the Academia Sinica, to jointly form a preparatory committee and actively promote the matter. It is expected that the formal organization will be established soon.

### Ministry of Finance Announces Stamp Tax Inspection Rules

Article 1: These rules are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the Implementing Regulations of the Stamp Tax Law. Stamp tax inspection affairs shall be handled in accordance with these rules, in addition to the provisions already stipulated in the Stamp Tax Law and its Implementing Regulations. Article 2: Stamp tax inspections are divided into the following three types:

1. Supervision and Inspection: The Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance is the supervisory agency and will assign supervisors at any time to inspect and verify stamp tax-liable documents throughout the country. 2. Random Inspection: The Direct Tax Bureaus and Tax Administration Bureaus of the Ministry of Finance in various districts are the random inspection agencies and will assign supervisors at any time to inspect and verify stamp tax-liable documents within their respective jurisdictions. 3. Inspection: The Direct Tax Bureaus, Direct Tax Sub-Bureaus, Tax Collection Offices, and Tax Sub-Bureaus of the Ministry of Finance in various municipalities are the inspection agencies and will assign personnel to perform stamp tax inspection duties in their respective jurisdictions.

Article 3: When necessary, each supervisory agency may, with the consent of the municipal and county governments in its jurisdiction and with the approval of the competent higher-level agency, provide appropriate subsidies and entrust them to send personnel to concurrently handle stamp tax inspection affairs in accordance with these rules. The subsidy measures shall be formulated separately. Article 4: After assigning stamp tax inspectors, each level of inspection agency shall report to the Ministry of Finance for separate issuance of stamp tax supervision and inspection certificates (to be used in place of direct tax supervision and inspection certificates), random inspection certificates, or inspection certificates.

Each level of inspection agency may issue temporary sales inspection certificates by order when necessary. If there are any changes in the personnel of each level of inspection agency, their inspection certificates shall be returned for cancellation immediately. Article 5: Stamp tax inspection certificates shall be collected and stored by the head of the relevant department of the inspection agency or the head of the finance department of the municipal or county government. They shall be issued to the stamp tax inspectors or concurrent stamp tax inspectors before they perform their inspection duties and shall be returned for storage upon completion of their tasks. Article 6: Before performing their inspection duties, each level of inspection personnel shall first show their inspection certificates and request the local police agency to send police or the local baojia chief to assist in handling the matter.

Article 7: Each level of inspection personnel shall conduct inspections during business hours and within the public or private business premises of the inspected agency. They shall not stop people on the road or enter private residences. The inspection dates and inspection targets shall not be notified in advance or exempted from inspection due to favoritism.

### Please Consider This, Medical Administration Authorities

— Zhi Gong

The lack of doctors in China is well known, and those who have gone deep into the interior have felt the pain of it firsthand. Once they fall ill, they cannot even find a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner for diagnosis and treatment, let alone a Western doctor who is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. However, it has recently been heard that there are more than 2,000 "unlicensed" doctors along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and even more in Shanghai alone. This deformed and strange phenomenon is caused by poor politics. For the sake of making a living, these people know that this is a deformed life that kills without shedding blood. It is not in line with the democratic politics of society, and they should also feel ashamed in their hearts. However, since there is no other way to make a living, they can only resign themselves to fate and muddle through. However, there are also many progressive and studious people among them who want to seek spiritual nourishment but cannot. Those who are scheming in society take advantage of this opportunity to cater to their preferences, using learning as bait to lure their wealth, and gradually using their large numbers of people to privately teach them strategies for gaining support. By this means, they are able to advance on the path of politics. The so-called emphasis on "quantity" rather than "quality" is merely a tool for enticing the masses. If the representatives of the national people are all obtained in this way, then it is clear that the national construction strategies they formulate when they are in power in the future will ultimately be unorthodox. For example, when a country is plagued by chaos, it must either suppress or appease it, and it must never sit idly by and watch the chaos spread. The reason why unlicensed doctors have gone astray is none other than the indecisiveness of the medical administration authorities. As it stands, since it is no longer possible to eliminate them by suppression, the only way to appease them is through guidance. Those who can be taught through training can become doctors, and those who cannot be taught can be divided into nurses and distributed to various parts of the interior to benefit the poor and sick. Is this not a plan that can achieve both goals? However, the policymakers are unable to come up with such a plan, and their measures are inconsistent. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government, without knowing on what legal basis, suddenly held an examination for unlicensed doctors in early June of this year, issuing temporary business licenses based on the results. The Examination Yuan turned a deaf ear to such a major event in the medical administration field. Is Shanghai not Chinese territory? It is heard that unlicensed doctors have repeatedly petitioned the government last year, but the government has not yet made a clear statement. As the era of constitutional government is approaching, policymakers should quickly convene unlicensed doctors for examination and screening, and those who fail should be given "re-education," so that those who are scheming and those who play with the masses cannot take advantage of them. This is a virtuous policy that will correct the deformed state of society and benefit the country and society.

### The Abuse of Tonics

— Hu Jiayan

In the current medical and pharmaceutical field, there are too many abnormal developments to count. The abuse of tonics mentioned in this article is one of the most important things that cannot be ignored. Originally, the nickname "Sick Man of East Asia," which has been accepted for decades and has not yet been erased, coupled with the adjectives that have always praised women for being "frail" and "able to dance in the palm of one's hand," should be regarded as trivial and not worth making a fuss about. However, the actual situation is by no means limited to this. I dare say that at least half of the examples are not suitable. To give two common examples: Vitamin B1 is a special agent for resisting beriberi, but the results applied to the original disease probably only account for one or two tenths of the total. It is true that its scope of application in medicine is very broad, but a part of the abuse (can be used or not, no different from a disguised seasoning) is undeniable. Vitamin C is a special agent for treating scurvy, purpura, etc., and also has the functions of resisting infection and treating bleeding. However, there are also many people who use it without any relation to the aforementioned diseases. Some people regard it completely as a tonic, and even think that the more tonics the better, and ask doctors to inject large amounts every day to seek quick results. This is a unique phenomenon in the medical field of our country, which is beyond the reach of European and American countries. The responsibility for this cannot be said to be completely absent on the part of the doctors. In fact, most patients have a smattering of knowledge and pretend to know what they do not know. Although doctors want to turn the tide, the result is nothing more than "a mantis trying to stop a chariot"!

The formation of the patient's psychology has gradually developed and can be said to have a traditional basis of thousands of years. Especially the rich, they usually live in luxury and dignity, and only tonics can show their noble status. For example, he complains of symptoms such as dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, fatigue, and weakness of the limbs. Even though it is caused by "playing mahjong for three nights," "dancing all night," and insomnia, this root cause is far less easy to listen to than saying that he is physically weak. Moreover, it is generally recognized that tonics have all benefits and no disadvantages, and the injections of new medicine can be directly injected into the body without having to pass through the digestive organs, and there is no need to worry about the stomach and intestines being unable to tolerate them and causing blockage. As a result, it is of course the general trend; and the market for tonics is also rising, forming a Jin-Chu struggle for hegemony with other daily necessities!

Once medicine is abused, various abnormal phenomena also arise. According to what the author can think of at the moment, there are already several types that can be described: (1) Using non-tonics as tonics. For example, glucose calcium injections are used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and other uses are not wide. However, there are also quite a few people who use them as tonics and inject them for a long time. (2) Meaningless application. What can be mentioned here is pure glucose injection. It has the functions of diuresis, detoxification, and increasing nutrition. Because glucose, salt, and water do not need to go through physiological digestion and can be directly input into the human body through the blood for needs. In acute infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, he is in bed for a long time, the amount of food is reduced, and he is also consumed by daily high fever, so it is inevitable that the patient needs to increase nutrition. His injection is of course suitable. Other diseases can also be inferred accordingly. However, in general patients who claim to be weak and have no shortage of three meals a day, their stomach and digestive functions are completely healthy and undamaged, so there is no need to do more. Because his nutrition can be fully supplied by food, even if the digestive function is weak, he can also treat the symptoms of the stomach and intestines, without having to overstep his responsibilities. (3) Increase in quantity. This is based on the psychology that tonics are beneficial and harmless and "the more the better." The above-mentioned example of injecting a large amount of Vitamin C every day is one of them. Regarding the use of Vitamin B1: a large amount is needed for symptoms such as beriberi and neuritis to be effective. For conditions such as indigestion, gastrointestinal diseases, weakness after illness, and weakness of the limbs, only a small amount is sufficient. A large amount will be quickly excreted, with no practical benefit, and it is a waste of money and not economical. However, some patients always feel that spending more money is nothing to them, and the larger the amount of tonics, the more effective they will be. On the contrary, they dislike the doctors for seeking accuracy in the amount used, which is a petty and stingy look. The author once mentioned this to a colleague, who replied with a smile: I don't think it matters, at most the urine and sweat will have a fragrance! This is truly the "fragrant sweat dripping"! Laugh!

So, when is it necessary to use tonics? This is a question that must be answered in this article. According to medical needs, there are the following: (1) After a major illness; (2) After surgery; (mostly due to excessive blood loss and weakened physical strength;) (3) During pregnancy and after childbirth for women; (4) Patients with cachexia; (5) Congenital deficiency; (6) Other; The last item includes a wider range. Whether it is suitable or not must be determined by the attending physician face-to-face at the time, and it is by no means what this article

Regarding the application of tonics, on the part of the doctor, of course, there is a basis and it cannot be done casually. Taking blood tonic as an example, for people with sallow skin or pale complexion, it can be known at a glance just by surface observation; but other cases cannot be followed by this example. It is necessary to be meticulous and conduct a detailed examination, including the components of hemoglobin, the number of red and white blood cells, the construction situation, and what pathological causes are lurking, and none of them can be ignored. Generally speaking, people think that the more blood in the human body, the better, so there is no drawback to blood tonic, which is a complete misinterpretation. To give a casual example, it is not suitable for patients with arteriosclerosis. Currently, the popular blood tonic liver paste does not seem to be suitable for diabetic patients either. Recently, hormone agents have been particularly popular, among which testosterone propionate injections are especially the darling of the heavens. In fact, it is not a tonic, and young people should not use it lightly (except for patients who are suitable), and they should even increase the weight (25mg), because they think the 10mg dose is too light, which is difficult to understand its purpose. Speaking of this, it is truly what the heart feels to be dangerous and must be expressed!

In short, tonics are not unusable; but whether they are suitable or not, the right to choose rests in the hands of the doctor. The author humbly offers 100% sincerity and sincerely asks patients to work hard to improve.

### Notice to Prospective Medical Students (Continued)

— Ruan Shangzheng

I am not against the theories of most patriots who want to preserve the national spirit and the quintessence of Chinese culture, but we must also consider the facts. Science in China has not yet reached the stage of independence and self-reliance. Those seeking knowledge must read original editions, and the application of Chinese in science is quite inconvenient. Individuals with aspirations often want to improve the Chinese script to make it convenient and applicable to science, but this cannot be achieved in the short term. For an immediate solution, we can only abandon distant goals and aim for what's near. Thus, scholars should dedicate themselves to research, and capable individuals should take charge of health administration. Seeking knowledge benefits both oneself and the country. As for how to improve Chinese and how to Sinicize medicine, these can only be discussed after political stability is achieved. Consider the history of the Germanic peoples. When their cultural level was still very low, those who could speak French were considered elegant. For example, Frederick the Great, who revived the Germanic people, used French entirely in his language, writing, and even the names of his palaces. Later, as the culture of the Germanic peoples improved day by day, great literary figures such as Goethe emerged, creating beautiful German. Consequently, people gradually abandoned French and used German exclusively. The *Chongqing Dagongbao* on July 10, year thirty-four, reported that the People's Political Council adopted the Ministry of Education's report, which included the statement "and plans to promote foreign language education," presumably with profound intentions. Therefore, the use of English throughout the medical field is even more justified.

In domestic health organizations, whether writing or speaking, English is used. Consequently, those who do not learn English but are proficient in other foreign languages face many inconveniences in collaboration. Even if there are those who stand out from the crowd, although they may be fortunate enough not to be regarded as unorthodox, they are ultimately ineffective. The resignation of a certain university president and a certain bureau director serves as clear evidence. They are simply recognizing the signs of the times. Mr. Tang Erzhou once said to me this spring when he went abroad, "The reason I can stand in the health field is because I have a slight knowledge of English." This is another strong piece of evidence. Mr. Tang is a graduate of Chiba University in Japan, and he can also understand English documents.

The government does not approve of practicing medicine without studying it properly. But in fact, those who study medicine but do not understand English have few opportunities for further study and development other than practicing medicine, unless they are willing to be minor staff in the health field. Examining the facts can prove this. Those who aspire to study medicine but do not intend to practice and wish to develop academically or professionally in the future will find it much more convenient to enroll in English-language medical schools than in non-English-language medical schools. People often say that there is a shortage of medical personnel, insufficient to meet the needs of the country. However, what is lacking is medical personnel who have studied English. A certain institution is also short of personnel to manage. However, graduates of a certain medical school are virtually unemployed. This is not a policy shield of the government; the real insider story is like this. I sincerely hope that those applying to medical schools will not go astray.

The author is a medical person who is not proficient in English and offers sincere advice based on past experiences and facts. Those with discernment will certainly not regard my words as excessive. However, if these words came from someone who only understands English, it would inevitably arouse resentment.

Jun Qing notes that this article by Dr. Ruan is probably a heartfelt expression. As medical professionals, we naturally hope that medical schools are free of factions, doctors are free of factions, and especially that those in power in health administration are free of factions, so that progress can be made in health and among colleagues. Otherwise, if we only shift with the rise and fall of international forces, it will not only cause the authorities to be indecisive and exhausted but also lose the meaning of an independent country. As for the words "Consequently, those who do not learn English but are proficient in other foreign languages face many inconveniences in collaboration. Even if there are those who stand out from the crowd, although they may be fortunate enough not to be regarded as unorthodox, they are ultimately ineffective. The resignation of a certain university president and a certain bureau director serves as clear evidence," although he did not specify who he was referring to, I do not want to make wild speculations. However, I am well aware that a certain doctor was only an ordinary doctor before the court, and he had virtually no achievements in academic research. Later, after going abroad for gilding for less than a year, he did not even grasp the basics of public health. After returning to the country, he managed to get a key position in medical administration in the midst of war and chaos, and gradually became the director of a certain bureau. If this kind of person is appointed to this position, how can the medical profession not be harmed? If it is said that he is content in his position because of factional differences, then that is not entirely the case.

### Preface to "Collected Medical Essays of Fan"

— Fan Shouyuan

I have collected, organized, and compiled my writings from the past few decades, which were sporadic and piecemeal, into this book. Except for a small part that was missed or excluded, most of them are included here. I have also titled this book "Collected Medical Essays of Fan."

I feel infinite emotion when publishing this collection of essays.

I started writing this kind of health and medicine-related text nearly twenty years ago. The time I spent writing this type of material was always based on momentary feelings, feeling the social environment at the time needed this type of material, needed me to do this work, and then I started writing. Therefore, the texts here, whether they are about health and medical common sense or comments and reviews, are all about things that happened at that time, giving me a stimulus. Due to the stimulus of these things, a feeling arose, and based on the feeling at the time, I wrote this type of text. I wrote this type of text because I wanted to have some impact on the medical culture of our country, to give the general public who lacked medical knowledge some common sense of medicine and hygiene. In particular, I wanted them to have a correct understanding and accurate knowledge of their own health problems and medical problems. I never expected that today—nearly twenty years later—a large part of these past writings would still be collected here for publication. Today, Chinese society still needs me to collect these old and worn-out articles of the past here for publication. This is not an honor for me. On the contrary, it proves that the progress of the issue of medical culture in Chinese society during this long process of time has been far too slow. (To be continued)

### Medical View of Watermelon

— Shou Wuqing

Watermelon is one of the fruits, known to old and young alike. Eating it during the hot summer months refreshes the mind and spirit. Moreover, it is priced low, making it a common summer product for both rich and poor classes, unlike oranges, apples, pears, and grapes, which are aristocratic and expensive, making it difficult for the poor to afford.

There are many types of watermelons, and the quality varies. According to watermelon sellers, Shanghai watermelons are famous for those from Pinghu, which are long and round and sweet, with varying sizes. There are also those from the Chongming area of northern Jiangsu, which are of poorer quality and slightly longer in shape, with pointed ends. There are also those from other places, which are round in shape. Some say that the origin of the watermelon does not vary by shape but only by quality. Roughly speaking, Pinghu watermelons are sweet, and Chongming watermelons are bland. There is really no single rule.

According to research, watermelons were originally a foreign product. Historical records state that the Khitans conquered the Uyghurs and obtained watermelon seeds, which they quickly returned to the Central Plains. Since its introduction, it has had a considerable history. The method of planting is the same as that of other melons. In the second month of the lunar calendar, sow the seeds in the soil, cover them with cow dung, wait for them to germinate, transplant them in rows, and gradually grow. They produce five-lobed palmate leaves, and the stems are like threads, soft and flexible, coiled on the soil surface, gradually spreading to a length of one or two zhang, producing pale yellow petal-shaped flowers. The flowers fall and bear fruit, which becomes as large as a dou, and is green or green, or alternating green and green, so named watermelon, because it came from the west. Since the Five Dynasties, it has spread all over the north and south of the Yangtze River. Because of the different soil, planting methods, fertilizers, and climates, its shape and color are very different. Even the inside of the melon has red, yellow, white, light red, and light white colors. As for the intensity of the taste, in addition to selecting varieties and cultivation, it is also directly related to the weather. Some say that there has been more rain this year, and the taste of the melons is inferior, which seems to be not without reason.

According to old medical properties, watermelon tastes sweet, bland, and slightly cold, and is non-toxic. Some say that it is slightly toxic in large quantities. It functions to quench thirst, relieve summer heat, moisten fluids, and promote urination. Eating too much can harm the spleen and stomach, causing fullness in the chest and diaphragm, abdominal distension, and occasional belching. People with weak bodies may experience flatulence and intestinal fermentation, resulting in a large amount of gas, causing light farts and rumbling sounds. Ancient books record that eating too much watermelon in the summer will cause severe diarrhea in the autumn. It is also said that Chen Fengyuan, the prefect of Fangzhou in the past, liked to eat watermelon, and he ate a lot of it. After eating it for a long time, he suddenly had back pain and could not move. He visited famous doctors for diagnosis and treatment, and it took a long time to heal. (Yanshou Book) Also, eating watermelon with sesame cake can harm the spleen.

According to new experiences, it is not impossible for older children with normal digestion and good health to eat a small amount of watermelon. If infants or older children eat too much watermelon, it is not only not beneficial but also very harmful. It is common to see eating too much watermelon causing vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in acute gastroenteritis, or other infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery, which are most common, due to unclean washing of watermelon skins and contamination with sewage.

The flesh of the watermelon is called Rang. It has the function of relieving heat. In ancient times, Chinese medicine borrowed it, calling it "natural Baihu Decoction." Patients with heat syndrome may use it as a heat-relieving and cooling agent. It is also said that its juice can cure mouth sores. The skin is sweet, cool, and non-toxic, and is usually discarded on the street, but it can be candied or medicated for consumption, or stir-fried to accompany dishes. Eating too much watermelon can cause fullness and stuffiness. Watermelon skin can be decocted in water to relieve it. (Shilin Guangji)

Between the Rang of the watermelon are mixed watermelon seeds, yellow and black, non-toxic. They are dried, stored, fried and eaten, and their taste is endless. Sweet and fragrant stir-fry, each is suitable, relieving boredom and leisure, especially called the best. In the Jiangzhe area, it is often used to entertain guests during the New Year. Suzhou watermelon seeds are known for their uniqueness, fragrant and crispy, and are essential for travelers. Some elderly patients with high blood pressure eat the kernels raw, saying that it can lower blood pressure, which is commonly called a single prescription, but the effect is not certain. I have seen a middle-aged patient who took raw watermelon kernels for as long as three months. The examination result was that his blood pressure dropped from 160 degrees to 150 degrees. The total amount of watermelon seeds eaten reached twenty catties.

Watermelon is a fruit product of our country, and European and American medical books do not record it. It is not found in the British and American pharmacopoeias. Its qualitative and quantitative analysis has not been examined in detail, but upon careful inspection, it only contains a small amount of hydrocarbons (sugar), a large amount of water, a trace amount of vitamin HC, no calorie (the name of the heat unit) supply, and no nourishing elements. Considering the actual situation, the value of a watermelon, at most, is only slightly better than a cup of rock sugar boiled water. Some say that eating more watermelon can reduce the occurrence of sores and boils, or that eating more watermelon can cure constipation, or that eating more watermelon can stop diarrhea and dysentery, or that eating more watermelon juice can cure injuries and high fever, or that eating more watermelon can cure kidney inflammation. All of these are unfounded rumors and cannot be based on a medical point of view, and are not worth believing.

### Engineering and Science

— Zhao Nan

The gradual development of airplanes from invention to practical use can be said to be the highest expression of modern human culture. In the past twenty years, aviation and other engineering fields have made rapid progress. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, invented many years ago, was only a simple equation of mass becoming energy; E=MC2 means energy is mass, and C is the speed of light. But today, this equation has been practically applied in atomic energy. To give another example, today's aircraft can reach speeds of 627 miles per hour, ranges of 100,000 miles, and altitudes of tens of thousands of meters. These figures were unimaginable twenty years ago.

Why has engineering made such leaps and bounds in the past twenty years? This question is very important, and we must study it carefully. Before twenty years ago, progress in engineering was simply the accumulation of practical experience in various fields. Therefore, every project had to be learned through practice, and tested after it was done well. This was time-consuming and expensive, and of course engineering could not make significant progress.

But in the past twenty years, engineering has no longer relied solely on the experience of predecessors. They have taken experience as a reference, using analytical methods and adopting basic scientific theories to promote progress together. Relying solely on experience is certainly slow to progress; but theory alone is also unworkable. Engineers twenty years ago thought that theory was of no help to practice, so they were eliminated.

We only know that Newton was a great scientist, and his contributions to physics and mathematics are well known to women and children. In fact, he was also a practical bridge engineer. Similarly, the great mathematician Euler had a formula in mathematics, and at the same time, he created an epoch-making formula in the study of columns in strength of materials.

The reason why scientists such as Newton and Euler were great is that they were able to integrate theory and practice. But today, scientific theories are becoming increasingly profound, and practical engineering is becoming increasingly complex. It is no longer possible for one person to see the whole picture of theory and practice. Today's great scientists can no longer be engineers. This trend of division of labor and cooperation is deepening day by day.

For example, in hydraulics, the theoretical aspect assumes that water is a "perfect fluid," that is, incompressible and non-viscous, which makes it easy to solve problems mathematically. But from the perspective of engineering science, water is not only slightly compressible, but its viscosity is also quite large. Therefore, the most important thing about all the formulas in hydraulics is the coefficient obtained from practical experience.

In the early 20th century, basic science and engineering unfortunately parted ways, and the distance between them became greater and greater. At this time, a savior suddenly appeared. This was Professor Felix Klein, the authority on mathematics in Europe at the time. He traveled from Europe to the United States to visit the first World's Fair in Chicago, and found that the United States had abundant resources and great wealth. He felt that Europe had no way to compete with the United States. The only way was to improve European engineering. So he decided to dedicate himself to linking pure science and practical engineering. Back in Europe, he founded the Department of Applied Mechanics. Many of the students in this department are now famous engineering scientists, such as Prandtl V. Kamani Timoshenko;

Busemann and Ackerest and so on. But old Professor Klein's goal was half successful, and half failed. Most of these students have become American citizens in the United States today, helping the United States to compete with Europe.

Since old Professor Klein founded the Department of Applied Mechanics, engineering science has embarked on the right track, and engineering has made unprecedented progress in the past twenty years, and the future is booming.

### Silent Typewriter

— Mei

The typewriters we use now make a "tap, tap, tap" sound, which becomes annoying after listening to it for a long time. Many engineers are studying how to manufacture silent typewriters, but none have succeeded. Recently, the US Patent Office issued Patent No. 2418.698 to Frederick U. Conard, granting him the legal right to patent his invention of a silent typewriter.

Speaking of which, this invention is not particularly new. It only adds an extra layer to the rubber cushion inside the typewriter, like a grid with small pores and cracks. The size of the grid is just the size of the font on each key. A steel rod is used as the center inside the rubber cylinder. Each time a character is typed, the grid moves out one grid, and there is no vibration transmitted to the sides. Therefore, the entire cylinder does not make a sound. This is the principle of the silent typewriter structure. The patent was sold to Underwood Corporation, and silent typewriters may appear in the near future.

### Arctic Climate

— Song Liwu

In geography, the area north of 66.5 degrees north latitude is collectively referred to as the Arctic region. Arctic expert Sir Huberi Wilkins, however, defines it from a climatic point of view as any area where the average temperature of the hottest month of the year is below 10 degrees Celsius. According to Koppen's classification of world climates, any area within this temperature range has permanently frozen soil and crops cannot grow. Even cold-resistant coniferous trees such as pines and cypresses have difficulty growing, and only mosses and lichens grow on the ground, which is called tundra or frozen desert climate (Tundra).), its southern boundary roughly coincides with the Arctic Circle. Although the hottest month south of this climate zone is above ten degrees, the coldest month is below negative three degrees. The winters and summers are distinct, and it occupies a vast area of land. All of northern Eurasia and North America and Greenland Iceland, etc. belong to it. Except for Northwestern Europe, most of it has not been fully developed, and the scene is desolate, not much different from the polar regions, so it is also included in the scope of this article for discussion.

The factors influencing climate change are quite complex. The distribution of sea and land, the direction and height of the terrain, the size of the solar radiation angle, and the warmth of ocean currents are all major factors that distinguish the nature of the climate and form a complex climate. Therefore, although areas are at the same latitude or even two places very close to each other, they often differ greatly and the scenes are completely different. Therefore, those who discuss regional climates must pay attention to this. The regional descriptions are as follows:

(1) Polar Climate The Arctic is an ocean basin surrounded by a large continent, with a depth of more than 4,000 meters. There is a narrow Bering Strait between Asia and North America connecting the Pacific Ocean basin. There is a relatively wide passage between North America and Greenland and Europe connecting to the Atlantic Ocean. The ocean is frozen almost all year round. However, only part of the surface melts in summer. In winter, it is a solid ice. Guangting extends to the coasts of Siberia, North America, and Greenland. In addition to the coast of Northwestern Europe being washed by the warm current of the Green Sea, the rest of the Kara Sea (Kera Sea) Baffin Bay (Baffin Bay), etc. are also completely frozen.

The Arctic climate is known for its coldness. In reality, its winter temperature is higher than that of other vast continental high-pressure areas, such as northeastern Siberia, northern Canada, and inland Greenland. However, the winter cold period is too long, and the longest night can last for as long as six months. The opposite is true for half of the summer, but the solar radiation angle is very low, the light is weak, and the impact of ground ripening is not obvious. Near the poles, the average temperature in January is about -40C Ellesmere Island (Ellesmere I.) is slightly continental, as low as -48 C to -51 C. Areas covered by ice and snow near the sea are slightly warmer, with an average of about -40 C to -29 C in the coldest month. The Gulf Stream washed area is the warmest area in the polar region, such as Frans Tosef Land -24 C, Green Harbour and Spitsbergen -22.5C. The temperature on the west coast of the above islands can rise to above negative 18 degrees under the southwest wind in midwinter.

Although there is daytime and nighttime irradiation in summer, the ground is still difficult to directly receive heat because of the low angle and the cover of ice and snow. The air temperature is still below the freezing point until the end of June when the accumulated snow melts. The air temperature of the humid ground rises slowly, although the dry land and the objects on the ground can heat up to ten or twenty degrees Celsius, the air temperature is ultimately difficult to exceed four degrees Celsius. According to the results of occasional observations, the average temperature in July near the poles is close to zero degrees, and about four and a half degrees in the Arctic Circle. According to the Soviet expedition in 1937, the average temperature in June of that year was minus two degrees Celsius on the ice block north of 87 degrees north latitude, and the highest record was one degree. The average annual range in the polar region is about 15 to 20 degrees.

(2) Frozen Desert Climate This climate zone is located in the southern boundary of the Arctic Circle, in parts of the Eurasian and North American continents. The sun is weak in winter, so it is extremely cold. The coast of the Arctic Ocean at the northern end is kicked by the sea, so it is not as drastic as the inland. The average temperature of each month from November to April is between negative 18 degrees Celsius and negative 60 degrees. The average annual temperature of Verkhoyansk in northeastern Siberia is only .16C and the average is -05.5. The value of -67.3C measured in a certain observation in January 1892 is the world's lowest temperature record, so it is known as the world's "cold pole" (Cold pole).

Most of the land is frozen all year round, and the accumulated snow does not melt. The ports are frozen, which is no different from the polar regions. The difference is that this climate zone has a cold and short summer that is sufficient for plant growth. The average temperature is slightly lower than 10. C. At noon in July and August, the temperature can reach as high as 25 to 38 degrees Celsius. At this time, the topsoil within one foot thaws, the accumulated snow on the Xiang Tang slope melts, and the ground is directly heated, so the dry-growing plants rely on it to grow. However, because of the frozen middle and lower layers of soil, and the frequency of strong winds on the ground, both are sufficient to hinder the growth of forests. Therefore, even in the most favorable areas, only shrubs or grasslands can be seen.

(3) Cold Temperate Climate The area within 45 degrees to 66.5 degrees north latitude is collectively referred to as the cold temperate zone and the Wanxi zone in the geographical zone. Due to the location of the Yuan and the different properties of the cold ocean currents, the regional climate is extremely obvious, complex, and changeable. Now, the east and west coasts and the interior of the mainland are described as follows:

A. The west coast of the mainland is located on the windward coast, especially Northwestern Europe, which is also blessed by the Mexican warm current. There is no extreme climate, and the marine climate is extremely obvious. The northwest wind is frequent, and it is warm, humid, and rainy throughout the year, with an annual rainfall of about 2,500 mm. The small annual temperature difference and the autumn rain are its characteristics.

B. The climate changes gradually from the west coast to the interior of the continent. The continental climate is gradually becoming obvious. Taking the temperature of Semipatinsk between Siberia and Central Asia as an example, the average monthly temperature in that area from November to March is below zero degrees, the ground is covered with snow, and the river is frozen. The coldest month is January, which is close to negative ten degrees. The summer is quite warm, and the average monthly temperature exceeds 15 degrees for about three months, and the annual temperature difference reaches 40 degrees. The transition seasons in the entire region are very short, the autumn is dry, and there is more rain in the spring and early summer. With the melting of ice and snow, there are often floods. The lower reaches of the Dong river are all at the northern end, and the riverbed in the lower reaches is still frozen at this time. (To be continued)

### Acute Plutonium Disease in the Atomic Age

— Hui Shi

In today's atomic age, there is another disease called plutonium disease. This disease is named after the toxic atomic bomb element plutonium, which can cause hair to turn gray, damage the liver, or cause slime tumors (Bone cancer). Workers in industries that use atoms to generate power or for other purposes need to take precautions against this new disease, just as workers in old industries need to take precautions against lead, mercury, and other toxic elements.

Although as far as we know today, no human beings have contracted this disease, its impact on animals has been proven to exist by experiments. Acute common symptoms are similar to those of the entire human body being radiated by X-rays or radium. The spleen shrinks and the liver is severely damaged. When this chemical enters the blood, it first concentrates in the liver and spleen, and then enters the bones. A year after plutonium invades the skin, the area of invasion will swell, hair will fall out, tumors will rise, and the symptoms of limb injury will be serious.

### Radar Blind Landing

— Wan Gongyu

Using radar to help airplanes land blindly has reached an important stage of testing. The U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration is testing a radar blind landing program called G.G.A (Ground Controlled Approach), which uses radar on the ground to measure the position of the aircraft and then tells it how to descend.

This method was invented by MIT. During the war, the Air Force used it to safely land aircraft in adverse weather conditions, achieving great success. At the airfield, a fixed towing vehicle equipped with G.G.A radar emits a rotating searchlight beam that can detect aircraft within 20 miles in any weather. When an aircraft enters this range, the operator sees it on the radar display and "calls" it down, using radio to instruct it to fly towards the airspace above the airfield.

When the aircraft flies within ten miles, two more radars begin to operate. One indicates altitude and rate of descent; the other indicates direction and distance. The operator can see a greatly magnified radar image, on which he can distinguish even the slightest deviations from the glide path, broadcasting clear instructions to the blind aircraft's pilot to guide it to landing.

The future use of G.G.A seems to be to help aircraft that cannot carry heavy and complex instruments. In commercial aviation, it is at least extremely useful for landing and traffic control. However, all of these conveniences will only be more widely adopted after the current setup, which requires five people to operate and costs $100,000, is simplified.

Science Book Review

### Scientists Fighting for Time

— Liu Cheng

"Scientists Against Time," by James Phuinne Baxter 3rd, President of Williams College, totaling 488 pages, published by Little Brown & Co., Boston, in November 1946, priced at US$5.

Every time the world goes through a major war, many newly invented weapons appear, such as the tank in World War I, and the rocket, radar, Loran, bombing sights, detonating fuses, and the notorious atomic bomb in this war. They all played a decisive role in the war situation at the time. Indeed, modern warfare is scientific warfare, using the cutting edge of scientific inventions to fight the enemy. Modern warfare determines success or failure in the laboratory rather than on the battlefield. Therefore, during wartime, scientific research progresses rapidly, inventions are numerous, talents are concentrated, and efforts are stepped up, fighting for time to gain the advantage. This is indeed the effect achieved by the scientists of Germany in the early stage and the United States in the later stage during the recently ended World War II.

This book is a comprehensive record of the achievements of military scientific research in the United States in the short four years of this war. It can also be said to be a part of history. The author is a historian who served in the Office of Scientific Research and Development during the war. He is very familiar with the organization, research, development, achievements, and application of wartime science in the United States. Furthermore, due to his position, he had contact with military and political leaders and government heads. Therefore, everything he discusses is detailed and reliable, as if counting his own treasures. Before the end of the war, everything was a military secret; after peace and victory, it became the history of science.

The book is divided into six major parts, totaling twenty-eight chapters, with four appendices and seventy-four illustrations. It first discusses the competition for the advantage of new weapons, then discusses various types and designs of new weapons, then chemical warfare, then military medicine, then the application of psychology in war, and finally the atomic bomb. The overall mobilization of scientific talents and scientific institutions, scientific research on strategy, land warfare, naval warfare, submarine warfare, and amphibious warfare are all discussed separately, with the sole purpose of fighting for time to defeat the enemy. The weapons used include newly invented radar, Loran, rockets, and various shells, explosives, smokescreens, camouflage, incendiary bombs, and flamethrowers, all of which are described in terms of their invention process and the effects of their use. As for the medical field, such as malaria prevention, blood transfusions and blood substitutes, penicillin, insecticides, rodenticides, D.D.T, and research on aviation medicine, are all discussed in detail. Finally, the book elaborates on the research, invention, and manufacturing process of the atomic bomb, the circumstances of the test, and the effects of its detonation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, describing everything systematically and methodically. The breadth of aspects and scope makes it difficult for someone who has not experienced it and is not rich in experience to complete this book.

In conclusion, after reading this book, we will obtain many novel scientific and military knowledge. Moreover, we can draw the following conclusions: First, far-sighted people in the United States knew, even before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, that war was becoming increasingly urgent and that the United States would inevitably be drawn into the vortex. Therefore, in 1942, under the wise insight of the late President Roosevelt, the Office of Scientific Research and Development was first established, with the famous scientist Dr. Vannevar Bush in charge, with the task of researching new weapons and national defense science in preparation for any eventuality. Second, scientific mobilization was implemented, and scientific experts and technical personnel from universities, research institutes, factories, and military departments were all adjusted and assigned to their original positions to perform designated tasks. Contracted work was also used to focus on specific problems, ensuring that people were used to their full potential and resources were used effectively. A tight organization, stepped-up efforts, timed assessments, and continuing work led to great success. Third, modern warfare is an adventure in which the fate of the nation is at stake, concentrating all of the nation's manpower, materials, and financial resources on one single throw of the dice. Fortunately, victory was achieved, but the nation's vitality was also greatly damaged. Defeat would mean national extinction and the destruction of the race, which would be even more unthinkable. If atomic bombs are used indiscriminately and without restraint, they could destroy civilization and more. Hoping to end war with war, it is hoped that this will be the last world war. Fourth, the progress in medicine during this war, such as the invention of penicillin, saved more lives than were killed in the war. Fifth, the research, invention, and manufacture of the atomic bomb not only represent a tremendous advancement in science but also demonstrate the greatest success of mankind through the combined efforts of scientists, engineers, industrialists, and even workers. As for the clarity of the book's writing and the beauty of its illustrations, these are secondary matters and need not be discussed further.
