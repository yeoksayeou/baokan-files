### Valiant National Army Troops Arrive in Jilin; Changchun Announces Martial Law, Hearts Are at Peace; Situation in Meihekou, Liaodong Turns Amicable

[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 16th] Changchun has begun deploying city defenses. Martial law was announced starting last night from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM, but the general public's hearts are quite at peace. There is no trace of Communist troops within 20 li around Nongan.

The Communist main force attack has already suffered a serious blow from the National Army. After suffering heavy losses, the Communist forces have been driven back to the area north of Datun, but their attempt to attack on both wings remains a significant concern.

[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 16th] The Communist forces are showing signs of attacking Wulajie and Qita again.

Since the 15th, large numbers of National Army troops have continued to head north, gathering along the Zhongchang Road and Changshen Railway. The Communist forces, who were besieging Jilin and Nongan and repeatedly failed to capture the cities, have now stopped advancing. Their confidence in seizing the cities has been completely lost. Meihekou, which was once in a state of emergency on the evening of the 15th, is also trending towards calm as the situation in the Jilin-Changchun area improves.

### Minister of Agriculture Zuo Shunsheng Assumes Office; Says He Will Still Maintain the Spirit of Working Together to Overcome National Difficulties and Develop Agriculture to Reduce the People's Suffering

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] The newly appointed Minister of Agriculture, Zuo Shunsheng, arrived at the ministry at 9:00 AM on the 16th to assume office and began working that day. This is the first time that a member of the Youth Party has been appointed as a minister after the government reorganization. Former Minister Zhou Yichun waited at the Ministry of Agriculture to meet and talk with him. Vice President Wang Yunwu and Political Commissar Lei Zhen both went to offer their congratulations. After Zuo and Zhou exchanged seals of office, they convened a meeting with the ministry's staff. Zhou Yichun first gave an introductory speech, saying that Minister Zuo has been a writer for ten years, an educator for ten years, and a politician for ten years in the past thirty years. In the future, I hope that all colleagues will continue to work hard under the leadership of Minister Zuo. Zuo Shunsheng then delivered a speech, first stating that his participation in the government this time was still in the spirit of working together to overcome national difficulties nine years ago. He humbly stated that he had been engaged in editing and educational work for twenty years and had been a councilor for more than nine years, but lacked experience in handling practical political affairs, and asked all staff to work together with one heart and one mind. Zuo pointed out that the policy guidelines agreed upon by all parties before the government was reorganized stipulated that stabilizing and improving people's lives was a responsibility that the Ministry of Agriculture had to share. Zuo stated that my country is an agricultural country, and more than 70% of the national population are farmers, but food and cotton cannot be self-sufficient, and daily necessities also rely on foreign countries, which is a terrible phenomenon. The export situation of silk, tea, vegetable oils, and bristles is also very worthy of attention, so we must strive for quality improvement in agricultural products through research and experimentation in the future in order to expand and promote production. Zuo asked all staff to put forward opinions on what should be promoted and what should be reformed and methods to overcome difficulties; especially how to fully utilize the assistance of foreign experts in the future, based on the report submitted by the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Team last year, which he hoped that all staff would study. Finally, Zuo stated, "I hope that you will encourage and supervise each other and help the country overcome difficulties and help the people alleviate their suffering."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] After Zuo Shunsheng assumed office this morning, the people of the Ministry of Agriculture held a tea party in the afternoon to express their welcome. When reporters asked Zuo about the future policy guidelines of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo firmly refused to express any opinions, saying, "If I were still a writer, I could freely express opinions and publish policy guidelines, but now that I am an executor, I cannot talk empty talk. Once a check is written, it must be realized." Zuo said in his speech at the tea party: "In the future, everything in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry can be made public. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is not a military secret, and there is nothing that cannot be said to others. Only by being open can we progress." Furthermore, the new Administrative Vice Ministers and Administrative Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Xie Chengping and Zhou Huangyun, are still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan meeting. (Signed by Zuo)

### Mei Shuceng Proposes Merging the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury; The Legislative Yuan's Economic and Legal Committees Conduct a Preliminary Review

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] The Economic and Legal Committees of the Legislative Yuan met on the morning of the 16th to conduct a preliminary review of the proposal by legislators Mei Shuceng and others to merge the national four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury into two institutions: the Central Bank and the National Business Bank, in order to save material and financial resources, strengthen credit, and develop business. Today's meeting was convened by Committee Member Li Qing, with representatives from various banks and bureaus in attendance, including Ji Chaoding, Cui Wei Wu, Zhu Tongjiu, Shou Miancheng, and Luo Yinpu. During the meeting, representatives from various banks and bureaus gave their reasons, hoping that the case could be deliberated from a long-term perspective before making a decision. The meeting adjourned at noon. According to the original proposal of Committee Member Mei, there were four major reasons: (1) Business conflicts. The businesses of various banks and bureaus, except for the Central Bank, are mostly difficult to classify and often conflict with each other, not only overlapping but also competing with each other. (2) Waste of human, financial, and material resources. The institutions of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury are established throughout the country. Not only are there separate institutions in the same city, but there are also opposing institutions on the same street. According to investigations, the National Bank has a total of 107 units, with 4,450 staff. The Central Bank has a total of 171 units domestically and 15 units abroad, with 3,365 staff. The Bank of Communications has a total of 173 units domestically and 5 units abroad, with 2,911 staff. The Agricultural Bank of China has a total of 255 units, with 4,621 staff. The Central Trust Bureau has a total of 37 units, with 1,675 staff. The number of staff in other postal and remittance bureaus and cooperative treasuries is unknown. The size of the organization and the number of personnel can be imagined, and the waste of national human, financial, and material resources can also be imagined. (3) Creation of a separatist phenomenon. The various banks, bureaus, and treasuries are all national financial institutions, but due to their different historical origins and personnel relationships, they each operate independently with strict boundaries, creating a separatist situation in the financial sector, making it difficult to implement a uniform and unified pace for the implementation of national financial policies. (4) Formation of a special class. The personnel of various banks, bureaus, and treasuries are all civil servants, but because all expenses do not need to rely on the national treasury, not only can office expenses be arbitrarily spent, but the salaries of staff can also not follow government regulations, enjoying special salaries and subsidies, creating a special class among civil servants. Due to the above four reasons, not only is there a need for adjustment in the system, but also for saving public funds, it should be merged. It is estimated that after merging into two institutions, at least more than 400 units and more than 8,000 staff can be cut. If the annual office expenses of each unit are calculated at 200 million yuan, 80 billion yuan can be saved annually. If the salary of each staff member is calculated at 20 million yuan per year, 160 billion yuan can also be saved. The functions of the two institutions after the merger are: the functions of the National Bank are to issue currency, regulate finance, manage the national treasury, and execute the mission of the "bank of banks"; the functions of the National Business Bank are industry and mining, agricultural loans, trade, forestry and fisheries, shipping, remittance, foreign exchange, overseas remittance, savings, trust, cooperation, and discount.

### Zhang Zhizhong Returns from Inspection; Says the People's Livelihood in Southern Xinjiang Is Extremely Painful; Improving Water Conservancy and Transportation Is an Urgent Task

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 16th] Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters and Chairman of Xinjiang Province, recently returned from an inspection of southern Xinjiang. He departed from Dihua on the 16th of last month with Inspector Maxiwude, Vice Chairman Ahemaitijiang, and a dozen or so staff members, traveling through the administrative regions of Aksu, Kashgar, Shache, and Hotan and Kuqa. The round trip from Dihua to Kashgar was by plane, and the round trip from Kashgar to Shache and Hotan was by truck, covering a distance of 10,000 li. It was the first time since the Republic of China that the chief administrative officer of the entire province had personally inspected southern Xinjiang. Chairman Zhang told reporters that transportation and communications in southern Xinjiang were lagging behind, and the people along the way did not know where to get news from. Passing through the journey, in the remote rural areas, the residents did not fail to bring the old and the young, lined up to welcome, performing courteous etiquette, with sincere expressions, showing the people's enthusiasm for supporting the country. Not to mention the crowds in the cities, who turned out in large numbers to welcome enthusiastically. This expression of the people's emotions deeply moved him and made him realize the urgency of the people's expectations and the importance of his own responsibility. Speaking of the general phenomena of this trip, the geographical advantages of southern Xinjiang are significantly better than those of northern Xinjiang. Wherever there is water, there is dense shade, houses are lined up, and the population is dense. In addition, the weather is warm and the soil is fertile, so agricultural products are also very abundant. The people are inherently simple and cute. However, due to the inferiority of the past political environment, no attention has ever been paid to local construction. The people's cultural level and living standards are backward. The suffering of the people's livelihood is beyond imagination. Improving the people's livelihood is the most important task at present, especially the construction of water conservancy, the improvement of transportation, the improvement of medical facilities and the enrichment of medical talents, the improvement of school facilities, the large-scale compilation and printing of teaching materials, and the promotion of social education all need to be resolved urgently, and the streamlining of taxes and the reduction of the people's burden are the most urgent tasks. The provincial government should do its best to meet the people's urgent expectations. As for military discipline, Zhang said that after years of hard work, it has already made great progress, and the relationship between the military and the people is getting better every day. In particular, the National Army in the Aksu region is assisting the people in carrying out flood control projects on a large scale. He went to the construction site to investigate and personally saw the spirit of the military and the people working together and being harmonious and friendly. He was very gratified. Zhang has been back in Dihua for several days and is currently supervising the departments of the provincial government to study future politics.

### British MPs Urge Government to Pay Attention to the Current Situation in the Far East; Eden Concerned About the Current Situation in China

[Associated Press, London, 16th] During the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Fletcher accused the United States of putting a "rubber curtain" around Japan. He said: "We can lift one corner of the rubber curtain, but when we let go, the curtain immediately falls down again."

Other Conservative and Labour MPs joined Fletcher in calling on the British government to pay more attention to Japan. Fletcher said that the government should convince the United States that Britain is a good partner for the United States in the Far East and that Britain "has a traditional right to participate."

"Although Japan is shrouded in a rubber curtain, it is ultimately easier to open than the Iron Curtain."

Fletcher also said that the government must abandon its passive policy towards China: "We must do our best to encourage various commercial and trade organizations and work with the United States and other countries to conduct trade."

Labour MP Batan said, "The government has little interest in the Far East and should pay attention to it. If we are concerned about the long term, the problems that occur in the Far East in the future will be far more important than those in Europe."

[Reuters, London, 15th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden mentioned the Chinese problem in the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons, expressing his sincere hope that the internal situation in China would improve and the long-standing friendly relations between China and Britain would continue to strengthen. Eden also urged the British government to conclude a trade treaty with China as soon as possible, not to fall behind the United States. Eden also mentioned the property of British people in China, pointing out that although the Chinese senior authorities have allowed the return, it is still being detained by the Chinese. Many British overseas Chinese, especially the British employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council, have been put in a difficult situation as a result. He hoped that the government would take steps to ensure that various legitimate claims are resolved within a reasonable period of time.

[Associated Press, New York, 15th] The latest issue of the American magazine "Time" said that the US State Department is preparing to revise its China policy to restore the past reputation of the government led by Chairman Chiang. The article also said that China is expected to ask the United States for a loan of one billion yuan.

### Publicly Funded Students' Non-Staple Food Expenses Adjusted Every Three Months

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Executive Yuan held a review meeting at 10:30 AM on the 16th and then continued to hold a temporary political affairs meeting. In addition to other proposals, the following two proposals were also passed: (2) The non-staple food expenses for publicly funded students are calculated according to the proportion of living allowances for public school staff in various regions, as per established practice. After the living allowances for civil servants were adjusted in May, the non-staple food expenses for publicly funded students in various regions have increased by more than 80%. For the Shanghai area, it has increased from the original 24,000 yuan to 48,000 yuan, an increase of 100%. This should be handled accordingly immediately. In the future, if prices do not tend to stabilize, adjustments will be made every three months. (2) It is difficult to approve requests for non-staple food expenses for non-publicly funded students.

### A Large Number of CCP Members Surrender to the National Army

[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 16th] After the recovery of Yanchi, CCP members have become increasingly dissatisfied with the various tyrannical policies of the CCP. They have been surrendering to the Ningxia National Army one after another, and the authorities are treating them favorably. The number of surrenders is increasing. As of now, there are already 220 people, including Ji Quan, Yang Xueyi, and Ma Zhanlin. Ji and others recently issued a declaration in the newspapers, permanently withdrawing from the CCP and vowing to be loyal to the country from now on. The declaration directly accuses the Communist army of being traitors.

### To Prevent Election Fraud, Laws and Regulations Should Be Formulated Quickly - Jian Guansan Talks About Cracking Down on Bribery in Elections

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Legislator Jian Guansan spoke today about cracking down on election fraud, saying that candidates should be restricted from using money, goods, banquets, force, and public or private positions as means of campaigning or as rewards. Whether the candidate comes forward himself or uses a third party indirectly, it should be considered illegal. Electors or agents who accept or request such conditions should also be considered illegal. In the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 15th, Jian proposed the formulation of the "Law on Cracking Down on Election Fraud." He believes that the content of this regulation should link together the articles related to elections in the criminal law with other matters related to election fraud to form a separate law. Jian said that in addition to legal restrictions, he hopes that the press will exert the power of social sanctions to achieve a responsive effect. He also recounted to reporters the reasons for his proposal: First, election fraud is inevitable even in advanced democratic countries. Therefore, the United Kingdom had the "Parliamentary Elections and Corrupt Practices Act" in 1880 and the "Prevention of Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act" in 1883, and France had the "Law on Cracking Down on Election Fraud" in 1902. Second, our country is in the initial stage of entering democracy, and election fraud is likely to increase. Therefore, it is even more necessary to formulate laws and regulations to prevent it in advance and punish it afterward. Moreover, in the past fifty years, the economic status of people below the middle class has been declining. If it is not forbidden to use money or power to carefully select candidates, the election results may be completely monopolized by those with wealth and power.

The National Army has recovered many small villages and towns. Sangzidian and Qihe on the outskirts of Jinan are both calm.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] In the area of Qihe, Yancheng, and Sangzidian on the north bank of the Yellow River on the outskirts of Jinan, the fighting turned calm on the 15th. In the triangular area of Changqing, Pingyin, and Feicheng south of Jinan, scattered Communist troops are lurking. The National Army has been strengthening its clearing operations since the 14th.

[Our Newspaper, Ziyang, 15th] The reporter visited Commander Wang Jingjiu today. According to him, the National Army is currently engaged in a new deployment, and the situation in Shandong Province will undergo a major change in the short term.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] The Shandong National Army is currently focusing on clearing the Communist troops in the southern and central Shandong areas. Therefore, the general offensive against the Chuan and Boshan areas has not yet been launched. As of the 15th, the situation south of Boshan remains deadlocked in the Hezhuang area outside Qingshiguan. However, Zibo has suffered great damage, the mining area has been destroyed, and the suburbs have been half-burned. The local losses are extremely heavy. The Communist 9th and 6th Columns near Mengyin and Sishui, and the Communist 2nd and 7th Columns in the Juxian and Yishui areas, are avoiding combat and fleeing everywhere, but the National Army has formed an encirclement, gradually shrinking it, and searching for its main force at any time to annihilate it. In the past three days, 20,000 Communist troops have been annihilated. The recovery of Ju and Yi is only a matter of time. The situation on the outskirts of Jinan has eased. There were no changes in the battle situation on the 15th. The situation near Sangzidian is deadlocked in Balizhuang, and Qihe is also confronting the city to the west.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] The decisive battle in the area east of Mengyin continued on the 16th. The Communist army is stubbornly making a last-ditch effort, and the National Army is also firmly seizing the opportunity to annihilate them. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented. The National Army, which defended Changde during the Anti-Japanese War, once defeated ten times its number with a single battalion today. Judging from the situation on the battlefield, the National Army clearly has the upper hand. Furthermore, although some small teams of Communist troops attempted to disrupt the road from Linyi and Mengyin to Xintai and Laiwu in order to divert the National Army's attention, they were also driven out or resolved by the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] Automobiles between Jinan and Tai'an are now running smoothly. The Jinpu Railway Bureau has been ordered to rush repairs northward from Guxian day and night. Recently, due to the large number of troops gathered between Tai'an and Jinan, there has been a housing shortage. Merchants and civilians in various places have voluntarily provided their houses for the army to live in, which is a testament to the public's warm welcome to the National Army.

### Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming Takes Office, Announces Four New Measures, Martial Law Lifted Throughout the Province, Clearing Operations End

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office was officially abolished today and changed to the Taiwan Provincial Government. This morning at 9:00 AM, the first Chairman, Wei Daoming, went to the Provincial Government to take office. Ge Jing'en, the former Secretary-General of the Office, handled the handover on behalf of Chief Executive Chen Yi, and no ceremony was held. In order to strive for social stability in Taiwan Province, Wei first announced: (1) Lifting the martial law that has been in effect throughout the province for two months and six days. (2) Ending the ongoing clearing operations in various parts of the province. (3) Abolishing censorship of newspapers, books, and postal and telecommunications. (4) Revoking military control over transportation and communication institutions. The above four matters will be implemented starting today. It is said that they were decided after consultation with Peng Mengji, the Commander of the Taiwan Provincial Garrison. Wei also announced that the exchange rate between Taiwan dollars and legal tender will be changed from 1:40 to 1:44 starting today in order to stabilize the economy of Taiwan Province. It is understood that Wei had agreed with the central government on changing the exchange rate while he was in Nanjing, and now it has been formally announced. Wei then convened the first provincial government meeting at 10:00 AM, during which the abolition of the following five institutions was approved: the Legislative Committee, the Taiwan Provincial Design and Assessment Committee, the Taiwan Provincial Public Enterprise Management Committee, the Taiwan Provincial Translation Bureau, and the Press Office. Other existing institutions that may be reorganized will be temporarily retained until a decision is made. Regarding the dismissal of civil servants, Chen Yi had already promulgated measures before leaving Taiwan, providing each person with severance pay and travel expenses, totaling four months of salary. Personnel dismissed before Chen Yi left, as well as those who are surplus due to organizational changes in the future, will be handled in accordance with these regulations. According to responsible sources, as of now, the new personnel who have come to Taiwan with Wei, including committee members and department heads, are less than fifty people. Therefore, in addition to abolishing the original institutions, they are extremely eager for the original personnel to continue to serve. In addition, Qiu Niantai, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, is still firmly declining the position, and various parties are still trying to persuade him to stay. Qiu is currently in Shanghai undergoing a medical examination, and his duties are temporarily being performed by Committee Member Zhu Foding.

### Special Treasury Bonds to Be Issued Soon - Zhang Jia'ao Calls Experts for Discussion for Days - Denominations Will Range from 100,000 to 5,000,000

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The issuance of special short-term treasury bonds is imminent. Central Bank Governor Zhang is calling experts in Nanjing for discussions in order to ensure the smooth issuance of the bonds. It is reported that in order to enable the general public to purchase them widely, the denominations of the bonds will start from 100,000 yuan, and then be divided into 500,000, 1,000,000, and 5,000,000 yuan, etc. There will also be registered and unregistered types, allowing purchasers to choose freely. (The US dollar bonds issued during the Anti-Japanese War also had registered and unregistered types). In order to facilitate the purchase procedure, the method of filling in the purchase date on the bond may be adopted, so that people can buy them on any day. Various parties have generally responded well to the government's proposal. The only concern is the fear that it will affect the promotion of US dollar bonds. However, according to a financial expert, although the interest rate on special short-term treasury bonds is higher than that on US dollar bonds, the government's ultimate goal in issuing these treasury bonds is to bring legal tender back into circulation and stabilize prices. After the above two goals are achieved, interest rates will naturally fall accordingly, and the promotion of US dollar bonds will not be affected. As for whether the government's burden of excessively high interest rates can absorb more floating capital than the interest it bears, it is also an unnecessary worry. The issuance of short-term treasury bonds has precedents in countries such as England and France, either to make up for budget deficits or to issue them temporarily for a specific purpose. The special short-term treasury bonds that our country will issue now will be discontinued after achieving the aforementioned two goals.

After being carved, it will be moved and built in front of the shrine. The construction cost is more than 60,000 Taiwan dollars, and it is scheduled to be completed by the end of June.

### Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau, He Yushu, Takes Office Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] The newly appointed Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau, He Yushu, took office at 3:00 PM on the 16th and spoke to reporters about his future policy guidelines: (1) To plan for both military grain and civilian food. (2) To strive to dredge the grain to Shanghai, suppress rice prices, and stabilize people's hearts. (5) To adopt a talent-based approach to hiring and administration.

[Central News Agency, 16th] The price of grain in Jiangsu Province has been stabilized after the provincial government invited the central government to handle the matter in accordance with its intentions. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan recently sent a telegram to the province, ordering it to quickly seek ways to suppress prices: (1) Protect legitimate grain merchants, (2) Freely circulate grain, (3) Procure large quantities of grain, which should be coordinated by the Ministry of Food and not purchased without authorization. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government has forwarded it to all counties and cities for earnest implementation.

### The Issue of Reparations from Japan - Difficult to Resolve Quickly

[United Press, Washington, 15th] The Far Eastern Commission and its Reparations Subcommittee have received individual applications from Allied countries for reparations from Japan in recent days. The total amount is so huge that the occupation authorities cannot allow it. A quick solution to the reparations issue is therefore impossible. The Far Eastern Commission hoped to agree on various foundations at the next meeting, and based on these foundations, accept applications for reparations, so that the Reparations Subcommittee could determine the proportion of reparations that each applicant country should receive. It is reported that in the past week, the percentages submitted by the applicant countries have far exceeded the total amount. The United States, as the main participant in the Pacific War, demands to receive at least half of Japan's reparations, but declares that it intends to distribute this asset to other Allied countries, especially the Philippines and Korea, and a small portion to the United Kingdom. China, as the second largest applicant country, is demanding 40 percent. The Philippines is demanding about 15 percent. It is reported that both the United Kingdom and France rank third among the applicant countries. Other countries believe that considering the extent of the UK and France's contributions to the Pacific War, these huge demands are unreasonable. People in the Far Eastern Commission feel that the Allied countries are haggling, which is the opposite of what happens in other Allied countries, especially Canada and New Zealand. It is reported that Canada is only asking for 1.5 percent, and New Zealand is asking for 2 percent. These numbers can hardly be reduced further. The amount requested by Australia is still unknown. A spokesman for the Department of the Army said that MacArthur has requested additional engineers to help with the distribution of reparations. The Department of the Army has not received any defamation regarding the handling of Japanese reparations work.

Editorial

### The Path to Peace and Stability

In the past ten days or so, labor strikes, student protests, and rice riots have occurred one after another. The social unrest and the instability of people's minds are almost indescribable. Furthermore, soaring prices and the hardship of people's livelihood have made the majority feel anxious, as if they are unable to bear the heavy oppression. Therefore, the whole country, from top to bottom, almost universally yearns for stability, so that the people in dire straits can have a chance to catch their breath.

In fact, after our country won victory after eight years of war, the wounds were deep and the pain was great. The government should have rested and recuperated with the people to cultivate the nation's strength. And the government certainly did not want to do otherwise. It was only because of the Communist Party's problem. As soon as the war of resistance stopped, the flames of civil war started again, resulting in today's chaotic situation. In the areas affected by the war, they have suffered direct disasters of artillery fire, making life impossible. Even in the areas not affected by the war, they have indirectly suffered from its adverse effects. Not only is it impossible to improve people's lives, but they also languish in dire straits like the people in the war zones. Now, more than ever, we feel the need to seek peace and stability quickly. Otherwise, if things continue this way, the nation will fall into an irrecoverable predicament! We do not want to be alarmist, but because of the responsibility of our position, we must raise the awareness of the people about the current situation in order to promote the early realization of domestic peace and universal stability.

First, we believe that stability and peace are inseparable. If the civil unrest does not stop for a day, then social stability cannot be fully realized for a day. Therefore, if we want universal stability, we must first demand the realization of genuine and comprehensive peace in the country. In view of the fact that the government's past "unilateral ceasefire" (this is what Zhou Enlai said criticizing the government after the government issued the ceasefire order) failed to achieve domestic peace, we have to appeal to both sides, asking the Communist Party to leave a glimmer of hope for the people of the country, quickly lay down their arms, and turn swords into ploughshares. We also ask the government to seize the fleeting opportunity to resume peace talks, so that domestic politics can turn hostility into true harmony. The reason why we are particularly emphasizing the Communist Party in today's call for peace is not to favor the government. Because we believe that the government authorities' desire for peace and stability is even above that of the general public. In the past, in order to achieve domestic peace, the government issued ceasefire orders several times. However, because this ceasefire order was, as Mr. Zhou Enlai said, "unilateral," it failed to achieve peace. Also, in order to adopt a political approach to resolve the CCP issue, the government has not only repeatedly tried to resume peace talks, but has also not closed the door to peace talks to this day. When the National Assembly was convened last year, the government sincerely welcomed representatives of the CCP and the Democratic League to participate. Even recently, the quota of CCP and Democratic League members in the reorganized National Government is still vacant, as long as the CCP can wake up, and prioritize the interests of the nation, immediately abandon the attempt to seize power by force. Taking the opportunity of the参政会 meeting, resume peace talks with the government, then the current political deadlock may not be difficult to break. Therefore, the key to domestic peace or war can be said to be entirely in the hands of the CCP. As Wang Chonghui said: "Whether peace talks can be resumed depends entirely on the CCP's decision. Realizing peace cannot be achieved by one side's hope alone. The CCP must also be sincere to make it possible." Our appeal for peace to the CCP in the face of the people's hardship may be enough to encourage the CCP to adopt a policy of promoting economic collapse through war. The current domestic situation may be exactly what the CCP is seeking. But we have to solemnly inform the CCP that if a political party does not take the welfare of the people as its premise, it will not be able to win the support of the people and will lose its essence as a political party. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the CCP can have a thorough awakening, prioritize the nation and the people, immediately lay down their arms, and leave a glimmer of hope for the people of the country.

Second, since what the people are yearning for day and night is peace and stability, the government authorities should do everything they can to strive for the early realization of peace and stability. Now the government has been reorganized, and the Min and Qing parties and social elites have also participated, sharing the important responsibility of the country with the Kuomintang. This is nothing less than adding a new factor to the realization of domestic peace and stability. At the same time, the policy guidelines announced by the new government after the reorganization also focus on striving for domestic stability and resolving the Communist Party issue through political means after the restoration of railway transportation. It can be seen that today's government is truly shouldering the responsibility of achieving peace and stability. The government after the reorganization, in terms of its nature, seems to be a transitional government before the implementation of constitutional government. Its only task is to complete all the necessary preparatory work for the implementation of constitutional government. However, the implementation of constitutional government is inseparable from domestic peace and stability. If peace and stability cannot be achieved, then even if constitutional government is implemented, it will still be flawed in terms of democratic significance. Therefore, we hope that the reorganized government must not consider itself a temporary government and neglect its important responsibilities to the country. It must be understood that even if the government is transitional, its responsibility remains consistent. In the future, all the government's policy measures should be divided into priorities. All important and urgent matters, after careful study and adoption of measures, should concentrate all efforts and spare no cost to ensure their implementation. Conversely, all secondary and non-urgent matters should be put on hold. We have already said above that what the whole country unanimously demands today is peace and stability. President Zhang Qun's promise to the people during the war was also peace and stability. In the future, the government should take this as the general direction of all its efforts. On the positive side, it should find ways to achieve the realization of comprehensive peace as soon as possible. On the negative side, it should also make every effort to avoid measures that stimulate social unrest. Today, the constant occurrence of labor strikes, student protests, and rice riots is due to many reasons, but the authorities' clumsiness and indecision cannot be excused. The government should be cautious in its actions and avoid acting rashly on any new measures. Although we cannot advocate "governance by doing nothing" at this time, all words and deeds that stimulate prices and incite the masses should be avoided as much as possible in times of unrest. Only in this way can we avoid adding to social unrest in the midst of chaos!

Third, we must also appeal to the people of the whole country to collectively exert effort for the movement of peace and stability with the spirit of "seeking solutions from ourselves," thereby showing the real power of the people. The failure of past peace talks was due to many reasons, but the most important one was that the government only knew how to value the opinions of parties and factions and neglected the opinions of honest people. To be honest, although there are many parties and factions in China today, we assume that each party has a considerable number of followers, but its followers are still a minority compared to the total number of people in the country. Today, for the sake of their own interests and for the sake of the country's interests, the people should no longer remain silent and must stand up and speak for themselves. The government wants to achieve the realization of peace and stability. It has listened enough to the opinions of various parties and factions in the past. In the future, it should listen more to the voices of the people of the whole country. Because only by relieving the suffering of the people can social stability be achieved, and only the real people can understand the suffering of the people. But how will the people express their opinions? We, the people, must also know that only by using legal means to tell the government about the hardships of the people and resolutely demand that the government adopt reasonable policies can social stability be achieved. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the government can pay special attention to the public opinion of the whole country. On the other hand, we also hope that the people of the whole country can stand up and tell the truth. In this way, communication between the top and bottom, and the integration of opinions from all sides, will naturally produce a plan for peace and stability. As long as both the top and bottom can abide by and follow the plan, it will not be difficult to achieve its goal. More specifically, institutions that can better represent public opinion, whether it is the upcoming National参政会 or the Intention Implementation Promotion Association formed by representatives of the National Assembly, should immediately publicly discuss during this period how to force the government and the Communist army to immediately cease fire on the spot, and force both sides to comply in earnest. If the government still wants to gather ideas and benefit from all sources, the speakers and deputy speakers of the provincial and municipal councils, the heads of national non-governmental organizations, and the leaders of the cultural, educational, industrial, commercial, and economic sectors, who can somewhat represent the true public opinion at this time, should be more valuable than the opinions of parties and factions. The government can also convene them to the capital and even invite representatives of the Communist Party to listen to the appeals of the people. They all come from the people, know the hardships of the people, and can express the hopes of the people. Only by relieving the hardships of the people and achieving the hopes of the people can the government achieve social stability.

### Palestine Investigation Team Formed; UN Special Session Declares Adjournment; Indian Representative Makes Earnest Appeal to Arab Groups

[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 15th] The United Nations Special General Assembly held its final meeting today, passing the Political Committee's resolution by a vote of 40 to 0, to organize a Palestine investigation committee consisting of eleven small countries. Those who abstained from voting included Adam Khan, Belarus, Czech Republic, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and 13 other countries.

The General Assembly also passed the agenda of the investigation committee by a vote of 45 to 7. The General Assembly further unanimously (Arab countries abstaining) passed a resolution proposed by Norway and amended by El Salvador, urging all governments and people, especially residents of the Holy Land, to refrain from using force or other actions that could harm the early resolution of the Palestine issue before the General Assembly takes action. Before the adjournment, Indian representative Ambassador Ali made the most earnest appeal to the Arab countries, and emphasized that if peace in Palestine is destroyed, World War III will inevitably break out soon. Ambassador Ali urged the Arabs to be patient and abide by peace, as preserving peace will strengthen the Arab position. Palestine has now become a testing ground for human conscience, and the future of mankind depends on the resolutions of the United Nations organization. If the总合国 organization makes a wrong decision, the whole world will not be able to achieve peace.

[Reuters, Flushing, 15th] It was announced here tonight that the Palestine investigation committee will hold its first meeting on the 26th at Lake Success. The committee will first prepare its work plan and route in New York, and then depart for Palestine and other affiliated areas to conduct investigations. UN Secretary-General Lie has informed the eleven countries participating in the committee that each country will only send one chief representative and one alternate representative. During the investigation, the committee will, like the previous Balkan Investigation Committee, work in subgroups. The secretariat will send about forty personnel to serve on the investigation committee, led by Assistant Secretary-General Dr. Hu Shi-ze of China.

### US Aid to South Korea Plan Will Be Non-Military in Nature

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Regarding the US plan to provide $200 million in aid to the US-occupied area of Korea, a responsible source told an Agence France-Presse reporter that this plan is different from the aid plans for Turkey and Greece and will be strictly non-military in nature. The US government will soon ask Congress to approve the necessary funds to aid Korea. State Department officials held a meeting this morning to discuss this issue, which lasted for a considerable amount of time. There are still many difficulties in politically and economically unifying Korea within the scope of the US-Soviet agreement, and the US aid plan for Korea may be slightly revised. The US government does not believe that this plan will hinder the meeting of the US-Soviet Joint Commission scheduled to be held in Seoul on May 20. The talks between the US and Soviet representatives will be on purely technical issues. The US authorities remain silent about the results of the US-Soviet talks. Although it is not entirely impossible to resolve the Korean issue within the scope of the US-Soviet agreement, the future is not optimistic.

Three Soviet Representatives Arrive in Seoul

[Associated Press, Seoul, 16th] After General Korotkov, commander of the Soviet forces in North Korea, accepted the invitation of Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in Korea, to participate in the US-Soviet Joint Commission on May 20 to establish a provisional government in Korea, three members of the Soviet advance team arrived here by train from Pyongyang on the 16th. The Soviet delegation will have about 75 members.

### US Naval Leaders Strive to Advocate Military Force as a Backing for Diplomacy Request House Committee to Pass Naval Budget Bill

[This newspaper news] San Francisco, 16th broadcast: US Admiral Nimitz delivered an important speech in the House Appropriations Committee today, stating that Britain and the United States are the two major countries in the world with the strongest navies and have now united and stand on the same side. Other key points of the speech are as follows: (1) The power of the United Nations is still insufficient to guarantee international peace; (2) US military leaders are drafting a "perfect plan" to prepare for full industrial mobilization in another war; (3) The timing for radio-controlled warfare is not yet ripe, so a strong military force must be maintained; (4) President Truman's $3.5 billion naval budget bill must be passed. Nimitz emphasized that the current situation is extremely chaotic, and the United States must not reduce its military strength before it improves, otherwise US diplomacy will lose its support.

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Secretary of the Navy Forrest told the House Appropriations Committee that the United States believes that the "push-button warfare" tactic cannot be realized in the short term, but the United States hopes to be prepared for this tactic when it is realized. He believes that the army, navy, and air force are still necessary for successful combat. So far, technical research in the field of transporting atomic bombs is still very far from the realization of "push-button warfare."

### Truman Writes to Congress Urging Speedy Passage of Relief Bill

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] President Truman, in submitting the tenth quarterly report to the United Nations today, wrote to Congress, once again urging Congress to pass a bill to provide $350 million in relief to China and European countries, and requested that Congress approve US participation in the International Refugee Organization and allocate $75 million in donations to the organization.

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] The Senate and House of Representatives today discussed a bill to provide relief to foreign countries after the UNRAA ended, but failed to reach an agreement and will reconvene tomorrow to continue the discussion. The Senate supports the full amount of $350 million, while the House advocates reducing it to $200 million.

### In the Next Three or Four Years The US Will Make Huge Loans Reaching $5 Billion Annually

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] What further measures should be taken after the US $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey is passed and implemented is a matter of general concern. People in Washington are increasingly convinced that the United States will lend approximately $5 billion annually to various countries in need over the next three or four years to implement the Truman doctrine of containment. Although this number is a private estimate, it comes from senior officials. Wallace also quoted this figure in a speech in Chicago, referring to it as essential to the permanent restoration of the lives of the people of Europe and Asia. Now that the aid plan for Greece and Turkey has been passed, the next step for the government is to seek Congressional and popular support for its global multi-billion dollar aid plan. According to detailed estimates, countries around the world will receive $16 billion worth of goods from the United States this year, while US imports will be half of this amount, or $8 billion. $3 billion of the difference can be paid for by the countries' gold and foreign exchange reserves, as well as US dollars used by Americans in those countries, but the remaining $5 billion can only be paid for by loans from the United States to those countries. There should be a similar difference in the next two or three years.

### Aid to Greece and Turkey Sent to the White House for Signature

[United Press, Washington, 15th] Congress today authorized President Truman to implement the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey. The Senate and House of Representatives Conference Committee has taken extremely rapid action to adjust the differences in the provisions of the two houses and has sent the entire plan to the White House for the President to sign and appoint officials to be responsible for its implementation. The first group of government representatives will fly to Athens at the end of this week. In addition, the State Department requested appropriations for this fiscal year, and the House is working to pass them, but it will cancel $31 million for foreign propaganda and broadcasting to China.

### Bevin Will Visit Germany in the Near Future To Encourage Germans to Overcome the Crisis Themselves

[Associated Press, London, 16th] The British Foreign Office recently revealed that Foreign Secretary Bevin plans to visit Germany in the near future to encourage Germans to work hard to overcome their food crisis and industrial crisis. It is reported that Bevin decided to inspect the British occupation zone after listening to the leaders of the British occupation zone in Germany submit an urgent report to London on the food crisis there. As for the date of Bevin's trip, it has not yet been determined, as he needs to rest before going to Germany.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves Treaty of Peace with Italy

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today approved a bill on the Treaty of Peace with Italy by a vote of thirteen to zero, and explained that the total amount of compensation paid by Italy is $360 million, which will be paid off in seven years, and cannot be considered too harsh. This treaty is the first step in restoring peace and order in Europe.

### British House of Commons Debates Foreign Policy Bevin Emphasizes Importance of Upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference Hopes Four-Power Treaty Against Germany Can Finally Be Realized

[Reuters, London, 15th] The House of Commons began a two-day foreign policy debate today. Foreign Secretary Bevin declared that the Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in London in November may be the most important conference in world history. If relations between East and West cannot enter a more satisfactory state than before, then no one can predict the future course of the world. Bevin expressed deep regret over the lack of agreement on the Four-Power Treaty, saying that Britain, France, and other Western countries all believe that the US-proposed Four-Power Treaty against Germany is an extremely important event. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union put forward amendments that were not directly related to this matter and stated that it could not accept the US proposal otherwise.　America's response to the call for East-West cooperation from all over the world has, in fact, built a bridge of communication between the two major opinions, and the establishment of this connection is sufficient to change the course of world affairs. He deeply hopes that an atmosphere in which this treaty can be concluded can be established before the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in November. He hopes that this treaty will eventually become a reality one day. Bevin also believes that the US-proposed Four-Power Treaty against Germany foreshadows how the course of world affairs will change. Therefore, before the London Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened, an atmosphere must be created so that this proposal can be adopted. Bevin also said that as a result of the war, the whole of Central Europe must be rebuilt. The delay of this task will inevitably increase the difficulties. Therefore, work should begin as soon as possible to organize the next stage of work in Germany. In reviewing the work of the Moscow Conference, Bevin said that there was no intention to overturn the Potsdam Agreement, but to realize it in its entirety, not just to select one part of it. The British government has not refused to consider using German industrial production as compensation, but it feels that there is an order of priority. The first thing to be dealt with is the economic unification of Germany, a balanced economy, and the reimbursement of expenses paid by Britain to maintain Germany's survival since the occupation of Germany. This is a legitimate demand. After this demand is resolved, the issue of compensation with industrial products can be discussed. Bevin continued to talk about the German-Polish border issue, saying that Britain must first study the facts before announcing its final decision. However, he believes that Poland cannot turn to Germany for compensation because its eastern land has been incorporated into the Soviet Union. Regarding the economic merger of the British and American zones in Germany, Bevin believes that it must be implemented as an economic emergency action for the benefit of Germany and the whole of Europe. Regarding the food crisis in Germany, he believes that rations are expected to improve in three months. Finally, he expressed his hope and belief that the merger agreement between the British and American zones will promote the unification of Germany.

### Eden Blames Soviet Union for Lack of Achievement at Foreign Ministers' Conference

[Central News Agency, London, 15th Special Dispatch] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden commented in the House of Commons this afternoon that it was regrettable that this Moscow Conference had failed to reach an agreement on any major issues. He attributed this failure to the "obstinacy" of the Soviet Union in a straightforward tone. He also believes that this stubborn attitude is unreasonable and incomprehensible. Discussing the German issue, he said that Britain has a special responsibility for Germany, and if it cannot reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, then Britain must act regardless of the Soviet Union. Most of the British people hope to cooperate with the Soviet Union, but this attitude of hoping for cooperation cannot be maintained unilaterally.

### The Three-Party Secretary-General Meeting for the Fourth Time: Agreement Reached on New Cabinet Policies; Conservatives Still Oppose Socialist Party Nomination for Prime Minister

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The third meeting of the four party secretaries-general was held at 2:00 PM today in the Speaker's office of the House of Representatives. Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio, Liberal Party Secretary-General Ohno, Democratic Party Secretary-General Sada, and National Cooperative Party Policy Research Council Chairman Miki all attended. Negotiations on policy agreements reached coordination and passed in the meeting. The content: (1) Important industries will be managed by the state. (2) Establishment of a sound fiscal and financial control system to prevent inflation. (3) Continued payment of interest on national debt. (4) Improvement of the rice purchase system. The issue of the ratio of the Prime Minister and cabinet member allocations will be discussed again on the 17th. However, both the Liberal and Democratic parties are quite reserved about Katayama's appointment as Prime Minister. Katayama himself is also very cautious on this issue and has now decided to visit Liberal Party President Yoshida and Democratic Party Chief Advisor Saito separately on the 17th to exchange views.

[International News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The organizational work of the Japanese coalition cabinet has now begun the second stage of selecting the Prime Minister and allocating cabinet members. The Liberal and Democratic parties have currently stated: "The Prime Minister should be decided by the majority," which strengthens the conservative parties' confidence that "the Prime Minister should be selected from the conservative faction with the largest number of seats." On the 15th, when the Liberal Party held an internal cadre meeting, they unanimously supported Secretary-General Ohno's insistence that "they cannot agree to the Socialist Party's appointment as Prime Minister." Although the Democratic Party has different opinions on the issue of party president selection, with Kijuro Shidehara, Hitoshi Ashida, and Saito each holding their own view, they are united in their strong opposition to the Socialist Party's appointment as Prime Minister. Therefore, the Liberal and Democratic parties' positions on the coalition cabinet, especially the selection of the Prime Minister, appear to be moving towards taking the same steps.

Yoshida Cabinet to Resign En Masse on Tuesday

[International News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The Japanese Yoshida Cabinet decided at a cabinet meeting on the 16th that the cabinet would resign en masse before the first Diet session on the 20th. Prime Minister Yoshida has decided to visit the Emperor on the morning of the 20th to submit his resignation. [United Press, Air Fortress Unit, 16th] A vanguard bomber team consisting of 130 air fortresses took off at dawn on the 16th to practice "simulated air control" over New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and other East Coast cities. The bomber team took off from six bases in the west, south, and southwest, and after concentrating over Cape May, flew directly to its destination. New York City was attacked for the first time at 12:30 PM Eastern Standard Time (1:30 AM Shanghai time), followed by four aircraft sweeping the coast and attacking seven major cities. The purpose of the Army Air Corps sending air fortresses to perform in the air is to show residents along the Pacific coast that "the taxes they pay are not wasted." The exercise was commanded by Brigadier General Ramey, and the altitude of each aircraft will be between 3,000 and 5,000 feet, and the formation will be two miles long. Individual attacks by each aircraft will last 40 seconds, and the entire exercise will be completed in 3 hours and 30 minutes. In war, 130 air fortresses can carry 1,000 tons of incendiary bombs or bombs.

Katayama Announces Policy Program

[Reuters, Tokyo, 16th] Socialist leader Katayama, speaking at a luncheon at the Tokyo Foreign Correspondents' Club this afternoon, declared that after taking office as Prime Minister, his administration's policies would be based on those of the British Labor Party government, especially regarding state ownership of enterprises. He said that the Social Democratic Party's plan is to guide Japanese political opinion into the path of democracy, making Japan a completely peaceful country and establishing a state-controlled economy. Due to the current economic situation, it is appropriate to organize a coalition government, but the basic policies of the Socialist Party will not change because of this. The main points currently under discussion are which party will serve as Prime Minister and how the heads of each department will be allocated. Since the Socialist Party has become the largest party after this election and its policies are the only ones that can overcome the current crisis, the position of Prime Minister should belong to the Socialist Party. Katayama continued that his policies will be implemented gradually and will never use strikes or demonstrations. The Socialist Party opposes the Communist Party and its methods.

### Wei Lihuang in Paris to Meet with French Minister of Defense

[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] General Wei Lihuang arrived here today from London and will stay here for two weeks to visit various military schools and facilities, and meet with French military leaders. He will be received by French Minister of Defense Flores tomorrow afternoon.

### France Officially Announces Policy on Vietnam: Decides to Continue Ruling Vietnam; Bollaert Delivers Important Speech

[French News Agency, Hanoi, 16th] French Commissioner to Vietnam Bollaert delivered a speech last night, suggesting that Cambodia and Laos should be autonomous, and that Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina should eventually be unified within the framework of the French Union. France will remain in Vietnam, and Vietnam will remain in the French Union; this is the first principle of France's policy on Vietnam. France reserves the right to rule Vietnam, without oppressing or disregarding the legitimate patriotic sentiments of the Vietnamese people.

### Indonesia Joins the United Nations; Netherlands Suggests Waiting Two More Years

[United Press, New York, 15th] The Dutch delegation to the United Nations has announced that the Netherlands intends to recommend to the United Nations that the Dutch East Indies become a member state of the United Nations within two years. Because the Indian representative Ali advocated that Indonesia, with a population of 70 million, should join the United Nations, the Dutch representative Roy proposed this suggestion, arguing that the Netherlands should represent Indonesia during a two-year transition period, after which the Netherlands will submit an application for it.

### World War II Was a "War of Futility"; Churchill Once Told Roosevelt

[French News Agency, London, 15th] The town of Ayr, Scotland, today awarded former British Prime Minister Churchill the title of Freeman of the City. He gave a speech stating: U.S. President Roosevelt asked me in 1943: "What should World War II be called?" I replied: "World War II should be called a war of futility." I have often said that preventing World War II was easier than any other war. After the fall of Paris, I urged the French army to adopt guerrilla warfare to contain 100 divisions of the German army. General Weygand said that even if France adopted guerrilla warfare to contain the German army, Germany would still have 100 to 150 divisions to conquer Britain. He asked me at the time: "What will you do?" I immediately replied: "I am not a military expert and always carefully avoid interfering in such matters, but my military advisors believe that the best way to deal with a German invasion is to drown the Germans halfway across, the more the better, and then strike the landing Germans head-on."

### Wallace Again Criticizes American Domestic and Foreign Policies; Denies Plans to Appease the Soviet Union

[French News Agency, Deirdre, USA, 15th] Former Vice President Wallace delivered a speech here tonight, strongly arguing that partisan politics are leading the United States to depression and another tragic world war. Wallace said that his recent trip to Europe was to search for the power of defending the world. If the current difficulties continue, we will encounter economic collapse. If the current foreign policy continues, we will encounter violence and bloodshed, and war will be inevitable one day. The appropriate remedy is to establish a good post-war relief plan for veterans, implement progressive income tax, develop natural resources, ban racial discrimination, reduce prices, and maintain consumer purchasing power. As for American domestic policy, it only makes the rich richer, the poor poorer, and the free less free. Wallace finally criticized President Truman's policy, which aims to disperse Britain's large troops and weaken Britain's power. This policy, which weakens the Labor Party, makes world unity hopeless. Wallace also said: When I traveled in Europe, I found that Scandinavia feared that Truman's policies might lead to war. Public opinion in France believes that the Truman Doctrine has created a rift between the French parties and supports de Gaulle's actions to overthrow parliamentary politics. American policy is actually de Gaulle's main tool. I now want to ask whether U.S. Ambassador to France Caffery's relationship with de Gaulle has been approved by the State Department.

[United Press, Deirdre, 15th] Wallace denied to reporters here on the 15th that he intended to appease the Soviet Union, saying, "I am seeking cooperation with the Soviet Union and using American resources to promote world peace and prosperity. I do not think that cooperation with the Soviet Union is appeasement. I really want to achieve world peace and prosperity."

### Abruptly Changing Attitude, Willing to Cooperate with Franco

[Reuters, London, 15th] British Labor MP Dr. Follick, who met with Spanish heir to the throne Don Juan in Lisbon this week, said during a foreign policy debate in the House of Commons that Don Juan told him that in order to realize Spain's constitutional monarchy, he was willing to cooperate with Franco to smoothly change the dictatorship to a constitutional system. Dr. Follick said that this was a major concession by Don Juan, as Don Juan had never previously expressed his willingness to cooperate with Franco in any way. Mr. Follick added that Don Juan also told him that after taking the throne, he would be an absolute constitutional monarch like the King of England, above party lines and would never interfere in politics.

### German Food Crisis

[United Press, Berlin, 16th] According to reliable sources, the German food crisis will extend to the Soviet occupation zone (where food supplies have always been more abundant than in other zones).

### Italian Socialist Leader Nitti Ordered to Form Cabinet

[French News Agency, Rome, 16th] The Italian Socialist leader Nitti has been officially announced to have been ordered by President Nicola to start forming a new government.

[Associated Press, Rome, 16th] Nitti is a financial expert, 70 years old, and was Prime Minister before the Fascist Party came to power. He does not belong to any party and will generally try to form an expanded "national unity" government to succeed De Gasperi's three-party coalition cabinet.

### British Minister of War Invited to France

### Three Indices to Be Published Again; Employee Base Salaries Not Discounted; Decided at Yesterday's Municipal Meeting

[Report from this newspaper] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, told reporters yesterday: The municipal government will still publish three kinds of living indices for workers, employees, and Western residents this month. The calculation of employee base salaries, as passed by the municipal meeting, will remain unchanged, that is, without discounts. The calculation of worker wages will be implemented in accordance with the central government's "Provisional Measures for Adjusting Wages of Workers and Employees in Shanghai," and the wage increases will not be discounted. Wages exceeding the work amount will be paid in full, without discounts. Monthly wages will be issued according to the living index published for April. It has now been decided that this month's wages should be issued according to the living index published for this month. The issuance method is as follows: For yarn factories that issue wages four times a month, the first, second, and third times will be issued according to the previous month's index. When the fourth wage is issued (usually on the 30th of the month), the index for this month has already been published, and the full amount that should be issued will be paid according to the current month's index.

### Rice Purchase Dispute on Huanlong Road; Eight Dou of White Rice Confiscated

[Report from this newspaper] At the Jufeng Rice Store at the entrance of Xiaotaoyuan Alley on Huanlong Road, white rice sold by the underwriting social bureau was purchased by a crowd of 500 to 600 residents at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Upon hearing this, the Changshu District Police Sub-Bureau dispatched police officers to the scene to maintain order, lining up and numbering people to purchase rice in an orderly manner. By 2:30 PM, more than 370 numbers had been sold (one dou per number, priced at 16,000 yuan). The store clerk claimed that the rice had been sold out. At that time, more than 100 people who had already been numbered had not been able to buy rice, so they started arguing and broke into the store, finding more than eight dou of white rice remaining. The crowd believed that the store had deducted low-priced rice, so they sent the rice to the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau to request punishment. The Food Section stated that the matter was related to the judiciary and did not accept it. The crowd then discussed donating the rice to a charitable organization.

### Secret Gold and Dollar Trading Case; Chen Ke's Trial Concluded; Chen Xianyou et al. Released on Bail

[Report from this newspaper] Chen Ke, from Shantou, Guangdong. Accused of opening the Taixing Zhan, secretly buying and selling gold and US dollars, and operating a bank and money shop, in violation of the Emergency Economic Measures Plan. The case was heard in the criminal court of the local court yesterday. The defendant argued: (1) Pledging 10,000 US dollars for 100 million legal tender is not circulation and does not conflict with the Emergency Economic Measures Plan. (2) The defendant's Taixing Zhan does not have deposit and withdrawal transactions, and cannot be regarded as a bank, which does not comply with the provisions of Article 7 of the plan. The court is requested to rule that the defendant is innocent. After the debate, Judge Zhai Jiaxiao ordered that the case be sentenced at 2:00 PM on the 23rd.

[Another report] On the 7th of this month, the municipal authorities, based on a tip, cracked down on a massive gold black market trading organization in the loft of a certain pharmacy, arresting the perpetrators Chen Xianyou, Chen Xianshu, Wang Keshu, and Shi Xiangshi, and seizing 36 gold bars and a small gold ingot. The case file was transferred to the local prosecutor's office yesterday afternoon for investigation on charges of disrupting financial order. After interrogation by the prosecutor's office, the defendants were ordered to be released on bail, and the stolen gold bars, ingots, and checks were temporarily handed over to the Central Bank vault for safekeeping.

### Strengthening Kerosene Control; Monthly Reporting of Allocation Quantities

In order to control the price of kerosene, the Public Utilities Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from Texaco, Asiatic Petroleum Company, and Mobil Oil Company yesterday morning to discuss future kerosene allocation matters. It was decided that the three companies would report the kerosene sold to various kerosene merchants to the Social Affairs Bureau on a monthly basis for control purposes. According to reporters, the second phase of kerosene for this year will be distributed in the near future, at which time the price of kerosene is expected to decrease. At the current price, each catty has risen to 2,200 yuan. The reason is that the Import Management Committee restricts the purchase of foreign exchange, and the kerosene shipped to the city cannot be purchased due to foreign exchange restrictions, and all of them are stored in warehouses, resulting in soaring kerosene prices. After this distribution, the Social Affairs Bureau will convene all relevant parties to discuss and determine the price of kerosene and control it to prevent price increases.

### Orchestra Suddenly Goes on Strike, Spoiling the Dancers' Mood

[Report from this newspaper] The orchestras of various dance halls in the city have recently jointly implemented a general strike starting yesterday because their request to increase salaries by 100% was not met.

### Factory Health Committee Holds Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] The city's Factory Health Committee held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room. The committee resolved to establish one director, three deputy directors, and 41 to 61 members. It also passed the following principles for implementation: (1) Expenses will be borne by the participating factories. (2) All factories are requested to participate. (3) Close cooperation with the Shanghai Workers' Welfare Committee, Factory Federation, and other relevant agencies. Work items: (1) Establish seven central clinics in appropriate locations. (2) Strive to establish a labor hospital with 100 beds within the year. (3) This year, start conducting labor health examinations, health examinations for new workers entering the factory, promote women workers' and workers' families' maternal and child health, and assist various factories in improving environmental sanitation. The second phase of implementation work stipulates that labor nurseries should be planned and established in phases in selected locations, and industrial safety equipment in various factories should be investigated and studied to reduce worker accidents.

### Speaker Pan Advises Jiao Tong University Students; Denies Calling the School's Students "Thugs"

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Zhonghua Times published a news item: "Jiao Tong University Student Uprising, Another Complication, Will Sue Pan Gongzhan." It was said that when the school's students were waiting for the train at the North Station, Pan had told the students that "you are all thugs," which caused public outrage and they would file a lawsuit with the court for defamation. Since the matter was sudden, reporters from this newspaper specially visited Pan at his residence yesterday morning, and he gave the following statement:

After the Jiao Tong University's protect-the-school movement decided to petition in Beijing, I was firmly invited by Mayor Wu and President Wu to assist in advising them. I have always expressed sympathy for their legitimate and reasonable school protection movement, as long as it does not exceed the scope of protecting the school. I have repeatedly stated that if there are no violations of the rules, it will definitely gain the sympathy and support of society. Conversely, if the actions violate the rules and are sufficient to disrupt public order or obstruct traffic, then I can represent the citizens and ask Mayor Wu to take appropriate action. Also, if unfortunately there are any riots, the local authorities should force a prevention to protect the safety of the majority of citizens. At that time, I never referred to the school's students as "thugs." Mayor Wu, President Wu, and the station staff at the scene all heard this and can testify to it. Therefore, if Jiao Tong University students do have the so-called lawsuit, it is not worth a knowing person's smile.

### Retired Chinese Employees of the Public Works Department Petition the Municipal Government Again; Angering the Mayor, Who Reprimands Them Sternly

[Report from this newspaper] At 4:00 PM yesterday, former retired Chinese employees of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, again supporting the elderly and carrying the young, totaling about 700 people, went to the City Hall to request Mayor Wu to give a concrete answer to the method and date of issuing retirement pay. The front of the City Hall was once again in chaos. The retired Chinese employees, dissatisfied with the Mayor's response, rushed into the back door of the City Hall Square. Fortunately, the police worked hard to maintain order and no accidents occurred.

According to representatives of the retired Chinese employees: When they visited Mayor Wu on the 29th of last month, the Mayor promised in person that if there was still no news from the central government on the issuance of retirement pay after two weeks, he would go to Nanjing to wait. Two weeks later (the 5th of this month), the representatives visited the Mayor again, and the Mayor immediately stated: I have just returned from Nanjing and am about to convene you for a discussion. And said: If there is no reply by Friday (16th), I will send a telegram to urge them.

Three Demands Made

Yesterday was the Mayor's last agreed date. The retired Chinese employees gathered in Children's Park at 2:00 PM, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, and sent Shen Yaoting, Wu Xucheng, Liu Shaoqing, Lu Jiandong, Li Junting, Ma Zongyi, Chen Tingju, and other seven people as representatives to visit the Mayor at the City Hall. They immediately made three demands: (1) Determine the date of issuance. (2) What standard is the multiple based on? (3) Is the approved 20 billion yuan for issuance a temporary relief fund, or the entire retirement pay? The Mayor's reply was: (1) It will be issued as soon as the accounts are settled. (2) The multiple will be based on the salary of municipal government employees. (3) It will be known after the announcement when the funds are issued. The representatives asked: Is the treatment of municipal government employees calculated according to the adjustment method? The Mayor replied: I will send another telegram to Nanjing to inquire.

A Din of Voices

After the representatives withdrew from the City Hall, they returned to Children's Park to convey the Mayor's reply. The crowd expressed dissatisfaction and rushed to the City Hall Square, causing a din of voices, demanding that the Mayor answer in public. The Mayor only agreed to meet with the representatives. When the representatives met the Mayor again, the Mayor sternly reprimanded the representatives for not leading the crowd to make trouble at the City Hall. At that time, the crowd broke in, but the Mayor left the government office without being able to meet with the crowd because he had other important matters. Until 5:30 PM, the crowd left without getting any results. They agreed to go to the City Hall again next Monday (19th) to negotiate.

### Canned Food Industry Encounters Three Major Difficulties

Currently, there are 15 canned food factories that have joined the trade guild. The industry's production has been greatly reduced compared to pre-war levels due to unresolved issues with tinplate, sugar, and coal. If the black market for tinplate is not eradicated and the allocation quota from the Transportation Control Committee is not increased, the industry will face a crisis of reduced or suspended work in two months when inventories are depleted. Other important raw materials, such as sugar and coal, are also in short supply. The sugar company's allocation is less than one-tenth of the monthly requirement, leading to high costs and affecting sales. The allocation of coal blocks is also far from the actual demand. Therefore, the canned food industry is currently facing three major difficulties. The industry is currently appealing to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, the Industrial Collection Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance.

### Resolutely Safeguard National Aviation Rights; Restrict the Water Transport Brigade's Ships to Transport Relief Supplies Only; The Aviation Federation Passes 62 Proposals

Yang Guanbei, executive director of the Shanghai Shipping Association, served as chairman. Li Jinglu, director of the Maritime Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, came from Beijing to attend and delivered a five-point speech on behalf of the Ministry of Communications: (1) The shipping industry previously lacked coordination, and it is hoped that this will be strengthened in the future. (2) The government attaches great importance to the issue of compensation and will obtain compensation of 500,000 tons of ships in the short term. At the same time, the government is paying close attention to restricting the development of Japanese overseas shipping to reduce the threat to world peace. (3) Organize collective marine insurance to protect the lives and interests of passengers. In the past, marine insurance was handled by foreign insurance companies, and we should eliminate the outflow of foreign exchange. (4) It is hoped that shipping facilities will be improved. The government will actively inspect the equipment of ships in the future. (5) The government will complete the overall plan for the shipping industry in stages. The most important of these is to reorganize the service capacity of seafarers to make them suitable for the increasing number of ships. In addition, Director Li hinted that the Ministry of Communications will convene a national shipping conference in Beijing after the official establishment of the Shipping Industry Federation to bring together shipping experts from across the country to discuss the future development plan of China's new shipping industry. Subsequently, representatives from various regions reported on the recovery and current situation of the shipping industry.

At noon, Xu, general manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, hosted a special banquet at the Guobin Hotel to entertain representatives from various regions and President Fan.

Key Measures; Ten Recommendations

At 2:30 PM, the third meeting continued on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. Sixty-two proposals were passed, the most important of which were ten key measures for the government to implement current shipping proposed by the Shanghai Shipping Association: (1) Resolutely safeguard aviation rights, support the domestic shipping industry, promptly and forcibly acquire foreign shipping assets in China, and strictly restrict the ships of the Water Transport Brigade of the Executive Yuan to transport relief supplies only and strictly prohibit the transport of commercial goods. (2) Quickly compensate for the wartime requisition, blockade, destruction, and seizure of domestic merchant ships, and negotiate for 500,000 tons of Japanese ships as compensation. (3) Various ships, shipbuilding materials, and other materials needed for the construction of the shipping industry obtained by the government, city federations, or friendly countries should be distributed to the shipping industry using long-term (at least ten years) payment methods. (4) Determine the national commercial port reorganization and construction plan, with Shanghai as the major port in the East. All confiscated enemy and puppet properties and acquired foreign wharves and warehouses should be provided for the common use of all shipping merchants, and the original wharves and warehouses of the Chinese people that were occupied should be returned quickly. (5) National banks should provide sufficient loans for the construction and operation funds of the shipping industry. All ships and other shipping assets that have been inspected and qualified by the maritime authorities may be mortgaged at 80% of the market value to support the development of the shipping industry. (6) Foreign exchange should be approved for the purchase of ships and the purchase of essential foreign materials for shipping. (7) Priority should be given to the sufficient allocation of oil and coal for ships, and the shipping industry should be allowed to purchase and transport from the production areas to maintain the operational efficiency of water transportation. (8) Coordinate the allocation of shipping routes. For shipping routes that are suitable for supply and demand or oversupplied, the increase of ships should be restricted. For shipping routes that are in short supply, the increase of ships should be encouraged through shipping bonuses and other methods, and scheduled shipping should be encouraged so that there are regular and close schedules on major shipping routes. (9) Freight and passenger fares on each shipping route should be changed to the method of peer negotiation. The local industry associations should adjust according to the price index or the main shipping costs (such as fuel costs, repair costs, crew wages, etc.). (10) Simplify the inspection of ships by military and police agencies in various places, effectively prevent various harassments, and reduce the suffering of travelers.

The second is three urgent measures for reorganizing the shipping industry proposed by the Shanghai Association: (1) Implement comprehensive joint operations in various places, concentrate the strength of the industry, and strive for transportation convenience and operational economy. (2) Freight and passenger fares and other business matters that should be consistent within the industry should be decided by the association, and all members of the industry must abide by them and strictly prohibit price reductions or any form of disguised price reductions. Violators will have their membership revoked and various effective methods will be adopted to correct them. (3) Pay attention to navigation safety and maritime responsibilities, enrich the ship's life-saving and fire-fighting equipment, implement hull and passenger accident insurance, eliminate old and dilapidated ships, ships without fixed passenger quotas shall not carry passengers, and cargo shall not exceed the load line to maintain navigation safety and reduce their own responsibilities. Finally, temporary motions were passed: (1) Request the government to add two seats for legislators and three seats for national representatives from the shipping industry. (2) It is recommended that the government enact maritime laws and regulations and establish a maritime court. After the meeting, Director Li said that the Ministry of Communications has expressed acceptance of the shipping industry's request to restore and adjust freight rates and is continuing to research solutions in addition to the subsidy issue. The association is scheduled to hold a cocktail party at 3 pm today on the Zhongxing Wheel to conclude the meeting.

### Sun Ke's Residence Burglary Case; The Principal Offender Appears on Location

[Our Report] At midnight on April 22, the residence of Vice President Sun Ke of the National Government at No. 22, Fan Yu Road (Columbia Road), was broken into by burglars. The lock on the back garden gate was opened, and the screen window inside the house was cut with scissors. A typewriter, a radio, an electric clock, and a fountain pen engraved with President Sun's name were stolen.

After the burglary occurred, Tao Yishan, Director of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters, was furious and ordered Xiao Fuquan, Captain of the Seventh Inspection Brigade, Shi Jian, and Yan Jinwen, group leader, to be responsible for solving the case. After numerous investigations, they obtained clues that habitual thieves were hiding in the Daxilu area of ​​West Shanghai. They then sent officers to conduct detailed investigations in the vicinity and found that their leader, Chen Guilin, lived at No. 2, Lane 403, Daxilu. They immediately went to arrest him at 1:00 AM on the 14th of this month in conjunction with the Baojia head. Based on Chen's confession, they continued to No. 53, Lane 400, Daxilu and arrested his accomplice, Shao Xiaosizi. According to the interrogation, Chen Guilin is 30 years old, from Huaicheng, and Shao Xiaosizi is 24 years old, from Yancheng. On the night of the theft, Shao and another Shao Xiaosanzi, who is still at large, broke into the back garden, and Chen Guilin acted as a lookout outside. The stolen goods, except for a typewriter that was pawned at Mingxing Pawnshop on Guizhou Road, were all sold by another accomplice named Xiao Guangdong. It was also found that Chen Guilin and others had committed previous burglaries, stealing a rosewood bed from a mansion on Dunxin Road, three carts of wood from Lujia Road, three large pieces of glass from Daxilu, and a machine and three boxes of soap from the Fahua Town, all of which were sold by Xiao Guangdong. According to the confession, the Seventh Inspection Brigade retrieved the typewriter from Mingxing Pawnshop and brought the thief to Sun's residence to perform the crime on the previous day. As the case was clear, they were sent to the Inspection Department of the Headquarters yesterday afternoon and will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling within days.

### Qingpu Massacre; Victims' Families File Civil Suit; Seeking Compensation of Over 200 Million Yuan

The case was heard in the District Court yesterday. Judge Ling Yuanqing stated that the case is within the jurisdiction of Qingpu County. If the plaintiffs believe that it is inconvenient to travel to and from Shanghai, they must petition the High Court to designate the case to be heard by this court before the trial can be opened.

### Elementary School Teacher Defrauds Uncle for Wife's Employment

Afterwards, Yang discovered that he had been deceived and reported the information to the police bureau.

### Historical U.N. Relief Mustang and Cattle Arrive in Shanghai

[Our Report] The UN Relief Agency arrived here yesterday afternoon on the "Emilius Victory" with a chestnut Morgan stallion and 668 head of cattle. The cattle and stallion left the United States on March 27 and were kept in specially built pens on the deck and in two-layer holds in comfortable conditions. Along the way, in addition to 200 tons of fodder, there were also two veterinarians and livestock handlers to take care of everything. The ship arrived west of the Panama Canal in mid-April, where its boiler pipe suddenly broke. It was towed to San Pedro for repairs, where the cattle and stallion were able to feast on California spring grass for two weeks before re-embarking.

The herd includes 65 male calves, mostly Holstein and Shorthorn breeds. On the way to China, the cattle were generally healthy except for a very small number who were slightly ill.

This stallion is the 250,000th animal transported by the UN Relief Agency for agricultural recovery programs in recipient countries, and also the last one, and the only horse transported to China by the agency, and therefore has historical value. The horse will be transported to the interior after vaccination, and the cattle will also be distributed to the interior of China.

### Brokers' Guarantee and Evidence Money to Be Paid in US Dollar Bonds; Guild Discusses Methods Overnight

[Our Report] The Brokers Association of the Stock Exchange received an order from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday afternoon that all guarantee money and deferred delivery money to be paid by brokers must be calculated and paid in US dollar bonds at 70% of their value from the date of receipt of the order. The Brokers Association considered the matter to be of great importance and immediately convened a meeting of brokers that evening. Chairman Chen Jingmin of the association reported the contents of the order from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and discussed how to handle it. The brokers present believed that the guarantee money of 50 million yuan, which was originally 20,000 in cash and 30 million in securities, now all had to be converted into US dollar bonds, which was difficult to turn around in a short time. Moreover, deferred transactions were completely buying and selling on behalf of customers, and it was difficult to guarantee whether customers had US dollar bonds to pay as evidence money. If brokers were to advance the funds, they did not have such positions. They all advocated that there must be a proper solution, otherwise there would be drastic changes when the market opened tomorrow morning, and how to deal with this loss. The discussion continued until about 11:00 PM without a result. The chairman then announced that the meeting would be temporarily adjourned, and the executive directors would gather to discuss it further. However, the meeting of the executive directors was also prolonged and undecided. The attending representatives of the brokers saw that they had been waiting for a long time and sent people to inquire, only to learn that Chen had left. The public was quite angry and decided that the executive directors and the attending representatives would hire a car to the residence of General Manager Wang Zhixin to petition, hoping to obtain a solution. Because a decision could not be made today, if the market were to open rashly, the market price would likely undergo a great change.

[Another Report] According to Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the Stock Exchange, because the matter is of great importance, it must be decided after being passed by the board of directors and supervisors. However, the brokers believed that the situation was urgent and could not wait any longer. Therefore, at 3:00 AM this morning, nine executive directors, together with Wang Zhixing and three representatives of the brokers, went to the residence of the chairman of the board of directors to discuss. As of 4:00 AM, there was still no result. However, according to Du, it is still advisable to open the market today.

### President Cha Liangjian of the District Court Speaks; Trial of Foreign Cases is Always Fair and Careful; Improving Prison Facilities is Being Pursued

[Our Report] Recently, the Millard's Review criticized our country's prison system and the District Court's handling of foreign cases. For this reason, the reporter visited President Cha Liangjian of the District Court to inquire about the recent situation of the court and the improvement of prisons. He gave a talk as follows: (1) The judicial aspect of China is striving for improvement and has made obvious progress. American jurist Pound (R. Pound) once commented on China's judicial system and legal education, saying: "The Chinese code is very complete, and it has many significant advantages that can be compared with any modern code." (2) The District Court accepted 8,911 civil cases and 14,135 criminal cases in 1946, including 316 civil cases involving foreigners and 368 criminal cases involving foreigners. All trials were conducted in a spirit of fairness and an objective attitude. (3) Several important foreign-related cases, including the case of the American Rogers hurting a bookseller, the case of Lai Lingnai instigating injury to death, and the case of Macebo violating economic emergency measures, were all handled impartially, striving to avoid injustice and leniency, and imposing punishments with extreme caution. (4) Regarding the guarantee system, according to the Civil Procedure Law, the court may order a creditor to provide cash collateral before ordering a provisional seizure or provisional execution. In addition, those who are suspected of committing a crime and apply for suspension of detention should submit a guarantee or a corresponding amount of guarantee, which is also stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. In fact, China's legal provisions are modeled after foreign countries. (5) Prison improvement issues: Shanghai originally had two major modern prisons, Huaxinjing and Caohejing, which could accommodate more than 13,000 people, but they were destroyed in the war. The current prisons have small capacity and are inevitably crowded. However, at a time when the national economy is extremely difficult, Shanghai prisons have successively approved the allocation of huge sums of money for repairs, which also proves the hard work of the judicial authorities. As for hygiene, much attention is also paid to it. Prisons have hospitals, and prisoners are vaccinated from time to time, and drugs such as DDT are used for disinfection and pest control. Therefore, prisoner illnesses have been greatly reduced. Other facilities are still far from ideal and will be improved in the future in order to achieve perfection. After the post-war recovery, everything is waiting to be done. The fact that our prison facilities can make progress in difficult times is understood by Chinese and foreigners alike. It should be known that Chinese courts and prisons are still in a period of striving for improvement. Regardless of Chinese or foreigners, anyone who can contribute well-intentioned opinions to this goal will be humbly received to the extent possible.

### Responding to the Strike at National Central University Jinling University Students Petitioned Yesterday

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th dispatch] Students at private Jinling University, in response to the strike and petition movement at National Central University, went on strike on the afternoon of the 15th and petitioned the Ministry of Education and the Executive Yuan on the 16th, putting forward five demands: (1) Increase the supplementary food allowance for publicly funded students to 100,000 yuan per month according to the cost of living index; (2) Convert all semi-publicly funded and self-funded students to publicly funded students; (3) Maintain education funding at 15% of the total budget; (4) Increase funding for private schools; (5) Immediately stop the civil war. When the entire body marched to the Ministry of Education to petition in the morning, Vice Minister Hang Liwu said: The publicly funded system is a wartime system. After the war, the number of old publicly funded students has been reduced by 30%. Currently, there are 130,000 publicly funded students in the country. This year's education funding has been reduced, so the first two items cannot be done. The third item is a general problem. The Ministry of Education gives the most subsidies to Jinling University for the fourth item, and it is impossible to increase it further. The Ministry of Education cannot answer the fifth item. The students were dissatisfied with the answer and questioned him in groups, but they could not get any results. In the afternoon, they went to the Executive Yuan to petition and wanted to see President Zhang. At the same time, they sent representatives to contact Vice President Wang Yunwu. Wang Yunwu came downstairs to speak to all the students. At that time, the students had all entered the gate of the Executive Yuan office building and sat on the ground. Some people had climbed the stairs and gone to the second floor. Wang said: The conversion of semi-publicly funded and self-funded students to publicly funded students cannot be considered at present. As for increasing the supplementary food allowance, a temporary political affairs meeting was convened this morning to discuss it and decided to increase it to 48,000 yuan. It does not seem like much for each person, but it is a very large number for all students. At the same time, it was decided to adjust it every three months in the future. The conversion of non-publicly funded students to publicly funded students cannot be approved. After Wang finished answering, the students were dissatisfied and criticized him again, believing that Wang should give a satisfactory answer immediately. Although Wang said, "I am the Vice President of the Executive Yuan," he was booed by the students. Wang left the hospital for a meeting, and Secretary-General Gan continued to talk, telling them that "The economic cafeteria run by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) at Jinling University was originally scheduled to close. The Executive Yuan has decided to contact the UNRRA personnel to continue running it to give students special relief until the end of this semester." The rest was the same as Wang's reply, and there was still no result. At about six o'clock, the staff of the Executive Yuan had dinner, and the students crowded into the cafeteria, usurping the host's role, eating and then leaving. Student representatives, principals, and professors continued to talk with Secretaries-General Gan and Pu until 9:40, and it was agreed that: "(1) Negotiate with UNRRA to expand the economic cafeteria, currently guaranteed by the school for loan management; (2) The conversion of semi-publicly funded and self-funded students to publicly funded students will be decided after contacting the various schools." Only then did the entire body leave the Executive Yuan, and they will continue the strike on the 17th.

### Second Session of Self-Funded Overseas Students Will Make a Collective Petition Demanding Passports and Foreign Exchange Settlement for Early Departure

[Our newspaper] The National Second Self-Funded Overseas Students Association, organized by 1,221 students from the second session of self-funded overseas students, was officially established in Nanjing on the 14th. Twenty-two representatives were sent from various places, including six from Shanghai, three each from Nanjing and Chongqing, two each from Beiping, Guangzhou, and Kunming, and one each from Hankou, Xi'an, and Chengdu. It was resolved to organize the National Students' General Association, which has a board of directors. Fifteen directors were elected by the representatives from various places to Beijing. Seven executive directors were elected: Zhao Yihua, Ding Zemin, Ling Shuang, Zhang Shengxiang, Xu Li, Chen Guozhong, and Li Hengyi.

### Executive Yuan Held a Temporary Political Affairs Meeting Yesterday Decided That the Supplementary Food Allowance for Students Is 48,000 Yuan Per Month

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th dispatch] National Central University students will suspend their strike for five days from the 16th. The reason is that Executive Yuan Vice President Wang replied that their demands would be discussed at the Political Affairs Conference. Therefore, there is no practical effect in insisting on a strike before the Political Affairs Conference. They will resume classes after a satisfactory result from the Political Affairs Conference. However, although the 16th was nominally a suspension of the strike, it was actually still in a state of suspension of classes. The Executive Yuan held a temporary political affairs meeting on the 16th and decided that the supplementary food allowance for students would be 48,000 yuan per month, which is still far from the students' demands. The National Central University Student Union convened a department and discipline conference again that evening and decided on the actions for the 17th. The association issued a "Declaration for Requesting an Increase in Public Funds Again" on the 16th. The content roughly stated: According to the replies from Vice President Wang and Minister Zhu to the five demands, there are two points: (1) The country is currently facing extreme economic difficulties, and it is really difficult to increase education funding. (2) A supplementary food allowance of 48,000 yuan per month is enough to maintain life. However, the demand for 100,000 yuan is based on government estimates because past education funding was extremely pitiful, accounting for only 4.85% of the total budget, which also included party and group expenses. Now, parties and groups are no longer allowed to draw from the education fund, and according to the constitution, education funding should be increased to 15% of the total budget. This increase in funding includes students' meal expenses.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th dispatch] Some newspapers published that Vice President Wang of the Executive Yuan said to the students of National Central University yesterday that he had promised to lend 50,000 yuan to each publicly funded student for supplementary food. A senior official of the Executive Yuan recently issued the following statement to reporters: "Vice President Wang did not say this during yesterday's conversation. He only promised to submit the petition to the Executive Yuan meeting for a decision. If funds are indeed urgently needed, half a month can be borrowed from the amount that the government has already approved."

However, recently, there have been increasing requests from various parties to add open divisions, seeing it as an opportunity to practice for the city and national games. Therefore, in addition to the original adult members group, junior A group (over 100 pounds), and junior B group (under 100 pounds), an open men's division has been added. The originally planned women's division, limited to association members' families and Youth Association members, has also been changed to an open women's division.

### Rising Star Female Athletes of Ji City

Visiting Two Young Ladies Who Broke National Records

[Our Jinan Aviation Dispatch] Jinan Private Fan Women's High School recently held its spring sports meet, where students Xu Meilin and Wang Canhua broke national records in the high jump, javelin, and shot put. Our reporter made a special trip to visit. It turns out that the school is a well-known church girls' school in Jinan, founded nearly twenty years ago. The school building was originally located inside the city, but later moved to a suburb two miles outside the east gate. The buildings are beautiful and the environment is quiet. Although the sports field is not very large, it has all the necessary sports equipment for women. The school stipulates that all students must live on campus, so they all pay widespread attention to sports during their spare time, achieving balanced development. Physical Education Director Wang Jingbo has been working at the school for a total of thirteen years. This long-term leadership and training is the reason for such achievements, which is no accident.

When the reporter visited, Priest Ke Shude (foreigner) and Wang Jiuxian introduced us to the two young ladies:

Miss Xu Meilin, from Zichuan, is lively and generous. She is quite tall and is a typical northern woman. She is only nineteen years old this year. She is recovering from a minor illness and has not fully regained her strength. According to her, she had an older brother who loved sports since she was a child, and he set up a high jump stand at home. Under the influence of her brother, she developed an interest in sports. In this school's spring sports meet, her high jump score was 1.40 meters, breaking the previous national record of 1.355 meters held by Miss Zhu Tianzhen, also from Shandong. She threw the javelin 29.50 meters, breaking the previous record of 28.55 meters from the previous National Games.

Wang Canhua, from Taian, is twenty years old. From her appearance, one can tell that she is physically strong and worthy of being a standard athlete. She has considerable strength. Her shot put score in this competition was 11.90 meters, breaking the previous national record of 10.35 meters. In addition, according to her teacher, Wang Jingbo, her discus score was 30 meters, which is also quite close to the national record of 30.05 meters.

The Jinan City Games are scheduled to be held on the 16th and 17th of this month, and they will all participate at that time. The pity is that due to the high cost of javelins, the event will not be included in the competition this year due to lack of funding. However, they all hope to have a chance to show their skills at the National Games held in Shanghai during the Double Ten Festival. They are at the peak of their youth and are in their second year of high school this year. They are striving for excellence, and their future is promising! (Our Correspondent Li Tian)

### Minister of Finance and Central Bank Official Talk - Foreign Exchange Lengthening Rumors are All False - Cannot Add More Stimulus During Price Fluctuations

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] Rumors circulated in Shanghai that foreign exchange would be adjusted. The reporter specifically visited Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun, who said that these were purely rumors spread by speculators and were not true.

Recently, there have been widespread rumors that foreign exchange will be lengthened, and the securities market has rebounded. According to a Central Bank official, there is no consideration being given to lengthening foreign exchange at this time. Speculators deliberately spread rumors in order to take advantage of the situation and reap huge profits. It is always their old trick. If you don't keep a cool head and fall for their scheme, you have only yourself to blame. Sources also revealed that in the current situation of turmoil, the government should seek stability. If foreign exchange changes again amidst current price fluctuations, prices will be further stimulated. There have been some lessons in the past, and it is not appropriate to act rashly because it involves too much. The government has other ways to remedy the export business.

[Our Dispatch] Recently, the market has been widely rumored that the exchange rate will be adjusted to 25,000 yuan. As a result, all commodities have rebounded. The reporter visited the export industry and related financial industries to seek the opinions of various authorities. The following is a summary: (1) Given the sharp rise in prices and the rampant black market exchange rates in recent months, if the US dollar exchange rate is raised to 25,000 yuan, it would not be considered too high. (2) The cost of imported goods is now calculated based on black market exchange rates. (3) The export trade has almost completely stopped. Although the government has recently planned to purchase, if the exchange rate can be raised to a suitable number, exports will be more active. (4) Since the foreign exchange adjustment in February, remittances from overseas Chinese have increased. However, because the black market exchange rate is twice as high, most of the remittances have flowed into the black market. If this can be changed in time, a considerable amount of remittances can be pulled back. The above are all different points of view, and they are recorded for exploration.

### Speculative Funds Vigorously Absorbing, Chinese Stocks Continue to Surge to Limit

Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw new bulls participating in absorbing chips. The dark market for Yong Yarn was nearing the daily limit. Northern speculative funds were vigorously absorbing, and 80-90% of the entire market reached the daily limit. With soaring commodity prices and the sharp decline of Hong Kong-Shanghai Power, the stock market easily sparked a buying frenzy.

The morning opened briskly, with Liann and Mayer being the first to hit the limit. After Yong Yarn opened, No. 188 had some selling, dropping back to 6440 yuan. Nos. 14, 112, 31, 77, 355, 222, 102, 197 came in, the market was extremely dry, and then it jumped to the daily limit. New Light, Sino-Netherlands, Quanxing, Datong, Rongfeng, Yonggong, Tongyi, Jingfu, New Asia, and Commercial all reached the limit. Nos. 85, 112, 77, 180, 199 then came in again.

Hong Kong-Shanghai Power narrowed to 16.75 yuan. Near noon, the rebound was significant, with Yong Yarn jumping to over 7100 yuan. Nos. 153, etc. closed out at high prices, and the noon closing retreated to around 7050 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong Yarn, Mayer, Yonggong, New Light, and Sino-Netherlands hit the limit. New China and Jingfu rebounded after hitting the limit, each rising by slightly over 10%. For immediate delivery, Yong Yarn, Mayer, Sino-Netherlands, New Light, and Jingfu hit the limit. Qin Xing rebounded after hitting the limit, rising by slightly over 10%. For cold stocks, Rong Salt, Tongyi, Commercial, Liann, and New Asia hit the limit. China Silk and China Textile rebounded after hitting the limit, gaining slightly over 5%. Matches also rose slightly less than 10%.

In the afternoon, 90% of stocks reached the limit. After Yong Yarn opened at 7000 yuan, No. 94, the Northern Gang, continued to absorb and raise it to over 7050 yuan. After that, rumors suddenly spread about a 20% special certificate tax, and selling pressure was strong. Nos. 76, 112, 28, 35, 61, 153, 4, 213 unloaded, and Yong Yarn gradually dropped to 6770 yuan. It then began to fluctuate. Nos. 172, 65, 232, 76 came in, and Hong Kong-Shanghai Power shrunk again to 16.5 yuan. After-hours trading rebounded to over 7100 yuan. Nos. 4, 85, 14 were sold off, retreating to 6950 yuan. Nos. 188, 171, 117, 94, 60, 85, 89 purchased in succession, and the dark market for Yong Yarn was pulled up to around 7250 yuan. Nos. 61, 152, etc. sold, and it began to fall, ending the day with low bids within 7100 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing, China Silk and New China Cement rebounded after hitting the limit, each rising by slightly over 10%. Immediate delivery Qin Xing rebounded after hitting the limit, also rising by slightly less than 15%. The rest all hit the limit, and all stocks outside the market rebounded strongly by slightly over 10%.

Unified Bonds Waver

The situation for government bonds yesterday was wavering. Unified Class C opened at 17,000 yuan, retreated from 17,300 yuan to 15,900 yuan, and struggled around 16,500 yuan at noon. Rooms 503 and 552 absorbed, while rooms 360 and 550 sold. Compared to the previous closing, Class A and B rose by 700 yuan, Class D and E rose by 1,000 yuan, and Unified Class C only rose slightly. Transactions totaled approximately 5 million yuan.

Foreign Stocks Decline

Foreign stocks declined yesterday from a firm market. Securities firms and retail investors absorbed, while Northern and Guangdong gangs, and money exchange businesses sold. Foreign firms had relatively more appetite for steel, Wheelock Marden, and paper. Ewo Yarn opened at 84,500 yuan, rose from 82,500 yuan to 88,000 yuan and then retreated, gradually falling to a low of 82,000 yuan at the end of the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Jardine Matheson rose by 10%, Wheelock Marden rose by 5%, telephone slightly declined, and the remaining stocks all rose slightly.

### Cotton Cloth Market Situation Strong

When the cotton cloth market opened yesterday, sentiment was quite weak because the Spinning & Weaving Company's 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was being sold at a loss of 4,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen Gold Seal Yuan Bi Ji at a loss of 2,000 yuan. Other items such as Yuanfu silk and Yuan fine cloth sold by quota were able to be traded with a price increase of 3,000 yuan. Around 11:00, news spread that securities were hitting the limit again and yarn prices continued to rise. Sentiment in the industry changed dramatically, and people rushed to buy additional subscription orders for the Spinning & Weaving Company. Because there were few subscribers the day before, although the Spinning & Weaving Company's Dragon Head fine cloth and Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji were all allocated, the chips were insufficient, and the situation was that demand exceeded supply. As a result, Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 13,000 yuan and Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji by 9,000 yuan, but it was still difficult to replenish. Therefore, the final result was that 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached a high of 288,000 yuan, an increase of 15,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other brands such as Five Blessings Blue Chicken Color Ball also increased by 10,000 to 15,600 yuan. Bleached cloth, coarse cloth, Zhigong, Yuan cloth, colored cloth, and Celanese cloth also rose uniformly from 5,600 yuan to over 20,000 yuan.

Remittances from Shanghai to Taiwan from yesterday onwards will be converted at this rate.

### Industrial Raw Materials Soar

[Report from Our Newspaper] Industrial raw materials previously rose repeatedly due to the soaring black market exchange rate. Later, due to tight credit and many retail investors unloading, prices softened for a time. However, due to the rise of exchange rate rumors in the past few days, sentiment has firmed, and merchants have competed to absorb caustic soda, bleaching powder, N rosin, soda ash, petroleum jelly, and other items, causing them to soar again.

### Prices at Production Areas Decline, Grain Supply Gradually Increases, Flour Prices Continue to Fall by Several Thousand Yuan

### Soybeans Temporarily Not Exported

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, international markets have remained eager for soybeans. China is temporarily not exporting in order to adjust domestic supply and demand. However, it is understood that the supply situation of soybeans in various parts of the world is improving, so the international market price of soybeans is expected to remain low.

[Another Report] A batch of soybeans, totaling 4,000 tons, transported by the Central Trust Bureau arrived in Shanghai previously. It is now learned that the Bureau recently has another 6,000 tons of soybeans being loaded onto ships in Yingkou, and it is expected that they will arrive in Shanghai within a few days.

### Barter Trade Still Not Developing, China Has No Goods to Export to the Soviet Union

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that the issue of barter trade between China and the Soviet Union has still not developed. However, the Soviet Union has been continuously shipping coal, newsprint, kelp, and other materials to this area for import. It is said that 90% of these materials come from South Sakhalin Island. China has not yet exported any goods to the Soviet Union. The brick tea, raw silk, tung oil, and other materials that China exports to the Soviet Union each year through the Central Trust Bureau are all to repay China's debts to the Soviet Union and have no trade relationship. It is said that these debts will not be fully paid off until 1952. The value of the various materials paid each year is approximately US$7-8 million.

### Prefabricated Houses Temporarily Suspended from Import

### Government Formulates Purchasing Plan for Export Commodity Prices

[Report from Our Newspaper] The international market prices of major export commodities such as tung oil and bristles have recently been trending downward. Domestic purchasing agents are unable to initiate foreign sales after purchasing, and are therefore slashing prices and dumping, causing international market prices to fall further.

It is now heard that purchasing agents in various places have requested the authorities to purchase these materials in order to adjust the financial situation of grain merchants domestically and then promote foreign sales in a coordinated manner. It is now heard that this request has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and a purchasing plan has been formulated and handed over to the Central Trust Bureau for handling. The Central Trust Bureau is currently studying the steps for its implementation. It is said that the purchasing plan is nationwide.

### Cotton Textile Industry Unwilling to Accept Simplified Examination Rules for Yarn and Cloth Transport to Hankou, Industry Association to Submit Official Document to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Approval

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Mr. Wang Qiyu, chairman of the 6th District Cotton Textile Industry Association, the simplified examination rules for yarn and cloth transport to Hankou and the simplified rules for yarn and cloth transshipment certificates promulgated by the Textile Control Committee recently are unacceptable to the cotton textile industry. According to the already promulgated measures for the control of yarn and cloth transportation and sales, the four regions of Northeast China, Hebei, Hankou, and South China are all under controlled transportation and sales, which greatly hinders the development of the cotton textile industry's future. The control of yarn and cloth transshipment is also considered too restrictive. The industry generally believes that it cannot be accepted and requests the authorities to revoke the two new simplified rules that were promulgated recently. He discussed this matter with Mr. Wu, the concurrently serving chairman of the Textile Control Committee, yesterday. It is said that Mr. Wu expressed considerable sympathy for the cotton textile industry's request and asked the industry association to first prepare a document stating the reasons so that it can be forwarded to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.

### Yarn Prices Initially Firm, Then Decline

Yesterday's spot yarn market: At the opening, news of a possible exchange rate adjustment boosted sentiment, and many new buyers were searching for goods. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix reached a high of 12.3 million yuan. However, due to the tight credit of industry players, they instead sold to ease their cash flow, causing prices to fall. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix retreated slightly to 11.9 million yuan, only an increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. However, the prices of other 32-count and 16-count yarn fell due to slack demand from towel factories and sock factories.

The Spinning & Weaving Company sold yarn as usual yesterday. Scattered individuals entered and made offers, and the bids were slightly uneven.

Kangfu Weaving Factory Shares to be Listed

### Agricultural Bank of China Offers Cotton and Tobacco Production Loans, Totaling Over 164.6 Billion Yuan, Central Bank Approves Advance Overdraft of 50 Billion Yuan

The Agricultural Bank of China believes that China's cotton-growing areas are quite extensive, but the yield and quality are insufficient to meet current needs, resulting in astonishing numbers of foreign cotton imports. In the future, production should be actively increased and quality improved. This year, in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's promotion of American cotton, the bank plans to offer American cotton production loans in 12 provinces, including Hebei and Shaanxi. The expected promotion area is 12 million mu, with an average loan of 10,000 yuan per mu, totaling 120 billion yuan. The funds will be used to purchase American cotton seeds, fertilizers, farm implements, pesticides, and to pay wages. It also plans to establish ginning and packaging plants, purchase machinery, and build factory buildings and warehouses, requiring a total of 10.6 billion yuan. Tobacco is also an important raw material, and its production and sales situation is generally similar to that of cotton. Each year, foreign tobacco imports result in significant financial losses. This year, in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's promotion of American tobacco, the Agricultural Bank of China plans to lend a total of 28.0035 billion yuan for American tobacco production and processing loans. The production portion plans to promote 520,000 mu, lending 15.6 billion yuan (the loan uses are the same as for cotton production loans). For the processing portion, it plans to lend 1.5 billion yuan for repairing drying barns, 10.9 billion yuan for coal for flue-curing, and 35 million yuan for building demonstration drying barns. The above cotton and tobacco production loans total 164.635 billion yuan. It is now learned that the Agricultural Bank of China, facing a shortage of funds, has submitted a request to the Joint Treasury for approval to re-mortgage to the Central Bank. The case has been approved, and an advance overdraft of 50 billion yuan has been authorized. The locations and amounts of the Agricultural Bank of China's overdrafted funds are listed below: Chongqing 1.1 billion, Hankou 6.4 billion, Changsha 1.4 billion, Guiyang 200 million, Shanghai 7.8 billion, Fuzhou 1.4 billion, Nanchang 2.1 billion, Hangzhou 5.4 billion, Wuhu 4.5 billion, Zhengzhou 10.7 billion, Qingdao 1.1 billion, Tianjin 1.3 billion, Xi'an 6 billion, Taiyuan 600 million, totaling 50 billion yuan.

### Coal Market Declines for Several Days, Only White Coal Lumps Remain Firm

Coal market: Bituminous coal sales remain sluggish, the market is quiet, and market prices are hovering on a downward trend. According to a telegram from a colleague in Hankou who went to purchase white coal lumps, although the market price of white coal is low, the inventory of high-grade goods such as Jiaozuo lumps and Laolong lumps is also low. Purchasers are only transporting small quantities of Pingxiang coke and Lantian coke. Therefore, although the coal market has been declining rapidly in recent days, only white coal lumps remain firm and stable, because there is no spot goods available from the production area.

### Wenzhou Longjing Firm and Strong

The Yangzhuang tea market, which has been overcast for many days, has still not shown any signs of dawn in the face of bleak buying interest. Sentiment is also extremely depressed, and the market has little excitement. It is now learned that China Tea and Wu Chang Tea companies are repeatedly cabling overseas regarding last year's Pingshui Dabang, requesting a price increase, but it is difficult to predict whether this will proceed smoothly. As for other domestic sales varieties, supply and demand remain relatively balanced, and market prices are mostly similar to the previous day. However, the Wenzhou New Longjing market is relatively firm and strong due to the impact of limited production and inventory.

Cement Tends to Rise

[Report from Our Newspaper] Cement prices are trending upward due to rumors that the exchange rate is about to be adjusted.

### Raw Silk Inventory Insufficient, Price Increases Unlikely to Decline, Rayon and Silk Goods Continue to Rise

The rising trend of raw silk is in full swing, and sentiment is unanimously optimistic. According to industry insiders, it is unlikely that the rising trend of the silk market will decline in the short term. There are three reasons for this: (1) Credit for industry players has eased; (2) The expected cost of new silk will definitely be higher than current market prices; (3) Last year's inventory was insufficient, totaling less than 5,000 piculs, which is only enough for domestic silk factories for two to three months. Due to the above reasons, even if foreign sales do not improve, the market trend is that prices will still be difficult to return to normal.

Yesterday, the rayon market continued to rise sharply. 120-count Kōzan bright yarn traded at 8.005 million yuan, and then gradually rose again, reaching a maximum of 8.2 million yuan. By noon, because the stock market had rebounded slightly, there was no shortage of people selling at high prices, so sentiment gradually softened, and it finally closed at 7.6 million yuan. In the afternoon, the market rebounded again, rising from 8 million yuan to 8.2 million yuan, 900,000 yuan higher than the previous day. 75-count semi-bright yarn also followed suit, increasing by 1 million yuan.

Yesterday's factory silk market was slightly quieter than the previous day. Bids were uniformly increased by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Only C-grade was priced at 20 million yuan. Other high-grade lots were also bid at this price. Aged lots were bid at 19 million yuan, and dry reeling was ignored, and the bids did not advance.

Because the raw materials for silk goods have risen again, factory prices have all increased, and as credit is gradually easing, transactions are also gradually becoming more active. Yesterday, the price of Mayer bedspreads was 8.6 million yuan. Dachang plaid crepe rose sharply by 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Rayon goods also rose by 4% to 5%. The prices of Shenghang and other goods all rose uniformly yesterday.

### Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau Adjusts Cigarette Tax Again

After the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance partially adjusted the tax on various brands of cigarettes in the city on the 10th of this month, it plans to universally adjust all brands of cigarettes again, increasing them all by 30%. It also plans to implement this on the 20th of this month. The cigarette factory industry association of this city has requested a postponement of the implementation and suggested that the date be extended to June 1st of the second half of the year. It is now learned that the Goods Tax Bureau has agreed to start from the 26th of this month.

### Full-Weight Tung Oil Rises

[Report from Our Newspaper] The price of full-weight tung oil in Hankou has reached 40 million yuan. Yesterday, there were many trades opening in the market, and the price has been bid up to 500,000 yuan per picul.

China Fir Gradually Rises

The market price of China fir has been rising recently. It is heard that rice prices in the production area of Fujian have soared, and sawmill workers are mostly calculated based on rice prices, resulting in an increase in costs, which has affected market prices in Shanghai.

### Shi Ma Longan Slightly Looser

Some Shi Ma longan has arrived in recent days, but because sales are relatively sluggish, prices have weakened slightly. For example, Maqu opened at 1.156 million yuan yesterday, and Mahong at 990,000 yuan, both showing slight weakening compared to the previous day.

Hardware Market Situation

The recent hardware market situation has been in a quiet process. A batch of foreign nails and sand cloth have arrived, so the selling price has gone from tight to soft, but actual sales are still smooth, and prices have not declined.

### Drought Forms in Hebei Province, Wheat Harvest to be Reduced

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 16th] Hebei Province has failed to receive timely rainfall this year, and a drought has formed. If it does not rain within the next few days, the wheat harvest will be reduced to below 50%. Some counties near Beiping have slightly better irrigation, and the drought situation in farmland is not as severe as in central and southern Hebei.

### "France's Tragedy" - An Old Tune Repeated? The Stage of the Fourth Republic

— Airmail from Paris, May 2nd. Special Correspondent: Mao Shuqing

France, the first nation to ignite the torch of liberty. Without the bloodshed at the Bastille prison in 1789, the democratic revolutions of the world might have been delayed for decades. After the First World War, France was the strongest military power. At the Versailles Peace Conference, a mere snort from Clemenceau could alter the course of international diplomacy. But in the blink of an eye, the "Maginot Line" was lost in three weeks, and halfway through the Second World War, the name of France vanished from the international stage.

French-Style Democracy Greatly Differs from British and American

De Gaulle called this transformation over the past twenty-one years "the decline of France." The writer André Maurois wrote a book called "France's Tragedy." Whether decline or tragedy, both refer to the decline of France's "national fortune." They both shared a similar view on the cause of this decline: the disguised and incomplete so-called "democracy" was to blame. In those twenty-one years, France changed cabinets nearly a hundred times. The multitude of parties and conflicting opinions led to low administrative efficiency. Coupled with the innate "hedonism" of urban French people—seeking comfort and enjoyment—they forgot vigilance and the importance of national defense, which was even more important than comfort. When I was in Paris the year before last, I heard a French friend talking about the "Tianbao era," saying that when the Versailles Conference opened in 1919, the French General Staff sent army planes to patrol and guard the skies over Paris every day. At that time, the aircraft industry was still in its infancy, and France had the largest number of planes. But by 1939, when Hitler launched his large-scale invasion, French planes were nowhere to be seen.

With great difficulty, the Axis powers were defeated, and France remained one of the victorious nations. During my year or so in the United States, I only saw France's position in the international arena gradually rising. The Four Powers became the Five Powers, with France squeezing in. The Five Powers then became the Four Powers again, pushing China out. A diplomacy professor at New York University, Hodges, once told me that France was able to replace China because of its internal unity. Professor Hodges' words clearly contained a well-intentioned warning for China. But he continued, saying that the Communist Party could use popular votes to become the majority party in parliament, without any external coercion. France would be the first. The question was whether the French Communist Party would be able to live in a democratic atmosphere forever. In other words, if the French Communist Party were to seize power, would it tolerate the existence of the Socialist Party, the Catholic Party, and so on? Professor Hodges still considered this a mystery. He asked me to pay attention to these behind-the-scenes issues after arriving in Paris and, if convenient, to write him a long letter.

During my three-week stay in Paris, thanks to introductions from the French intelligence service, I met many people and heard many different opinions. My overall impression of these visits was that, first, French democracy is vastly different from that of Britain and America. Britain and America emphasize "party politics." People from two different parties generally share similar views on domestic and foreign affairs. Britons and Americans are never willing to say which party they belong to, or even whether they will vote Republican or Democratic today. The French are not like that. The gulf between parties is deep, and attacks are fierce, sometimes even resorting to unscrupulous means to achieve their mutual attacks. In other words, Britons and Americans emphasize party politics, but party affiliation is weak. The French emphasize party politics, and party affiliation is strong. British and American party newspapers never admit that they are party newspapers. French party newspapers are forthright. To put it more bluntly, Britons and Americans believe that the nation is more important than the party. The French believe that the party is more important than the nation. I am not exaggerating when I say this. The Parisian newspaper "L'Humanité" has several columns of reasoned articles every day arguing for abandoning nationalism and that the French should discard "the concept of the nation inherited from the Middle Ages. Because...the so-called national concept, love of the motherland, and even the French Empire, are tools of the ruling class!"

New Wine in Old Bottles, Fresh Paint on the Door

The concept of the nation is reflected in the real problems facing France: the Vietnam War and the Madagascar affair. On March 11th of this year, when the National Assembly met to discuss the Vietnam issue, Communist Party deputy Garcia physically attacked right-wing deputy Pierre André, throwing the meeting into chaos. Before this adjournment, another major incident occurred in the National Assembly. The French Ministry of Defense discovered evidence that four deputies from Madagascar had colluded in an insurrection by workers on the island, and the police headquarters prepared to arrest them. The Communist Party has always opposed the use of force in Vietnam and Madagascar, defended the four deputies, and cited the Constitution: the personal freedom of members of parliament cannot be infringed upon. Without the consent of all members, security agencies cannot act illegally. When that Communist Party deputy spoke with impassioned eloquence, another deputy from the Catholic Party slapped him, throwing the entire chamber into chaos again. This was the second time.

Afterward, the National Assembly announced a one-month adjournment, reopening only recently. Parisian newspapers have headlined the re-discussed dispute. The French love to watch a spectacle. Most French people are passionate about politics but have no interest in making rational analyses. The traditional "representative politics" has accustomed them to entrusting political power to political parties, allowing political parties to adhere to "the separation of powers and checks and balances." During the sixty-five years of the Third Republic, France went from chaos to stability to prosperity, even leading the world for a period, before the "Tragedy of France" in 1940. When the Fourth Republic was first inaugurated, the national hero De Gaulle vowed to make France "undergo a complete transformation" and not repeat the old path of the Third Republic. However, last year, the people voted for a new constitution, which remained one of party politics and representative politics. The French people said: If not this, what else can we do? De Gaulle's desire for centralized power and military reorganization certainly made sense. But we endured hardship and defeated the fascists; we cannot allow ourselves to have a fascist regime!

Thus, the Fourth Republic remained indistinguishable from the Third Republic. New wine in old bottles. Although the names have changed, the reality remains that of the celebrities and politicians of over a decade ago. The Senate is now called the "French Parliament," and the lower house by the Seine River, freshly painted, is called the "National Assembly Hall." Of the 619 seats in the National Assembly, the Communist Party has the most, followed by the Socialist Party, and then the Popular Republican Movement. These are the "three pillars" that currently control the government. Next are Herriot's "Radical Socialist Party," the right-wing "Catholic Party," and even the far-right "Liberal Republican Party." De Gaulle's "Rally of the French People" was newly formed and could not participate in the elections at the beginning of this year.

Thorez's Secretary: Comrade Ducroux

I did not have the opportunity to meet the leader of the French Communist Party, Thorez. After De Gaulle's party-building plan was announced, Thorez gave a public speech, severely scolding De Gaulle. His speech was not particularly lively but was clear and well-organized. He had spent a long time in Moscow and most of the war years in Soviet Russia. Therefore, during De Gaulle's tenure, there were several attempts to punish him for the crime of "evading military service." At a press conference after Wallace arrived in Paris, I met Thorez's secretary, Comrade Ducroux, who had been dispatched by the French Communist Party to receive Wallace. He spoke excellent English. He said that Thorez had the support of five million industrial workers, and "only the Communist Party is truly working for the happiness of French workers." He also said that France is now poor, its economy exhausted, and its finances are unbalanced. Yet it still maintains a large army of 400,000 troops overseas, using force against the weak Vietnamese nation, using force against Madagascar, and maintaining vigilance in North Africa, stubbornly maintaining the interests of the "old empire." Every day, the supplies to overseas territories cost more than a million francs. The victims are the French working masses. Therefore, the Communist Party is firmly opposed in the National Assembly.

Ducroux was unwilling to talk about the relationship between the French Communist Party and Moscow, but he admitted that the Communist Party has no national concept. Regarding the current situation in France, he believed that since all parties were uneasy about the Communist Party taking the position of "Prime Minister," they should allow the "Socialist Party" to transition. He said, "The Socialist Party claims to be Marxist, but they are not true believers!"

### "Father of the Popular Front": Léon Blum's Style

The founding father of the Socialist Party is Léon Blum, the father of the "Popular Front" worldwide. This extraordinary old man recently celebrated his seventy-sixth birthday. All the celebrities and political figures in France attended the celebration, with only one exception: De Gaulle. It is said that Léon Blum personally instructed not to invite De Gaulle to participate. Whether this is true or false, we outsiders have no way of knowing. That was four or five days after the Strasbourg speech.

In an era where liberalism and totalitarianism, capitalism and communism, are irreconcilable and have not yet reached a breaking point, Léon Blum is an inevitable product. Although there is only one Léon Blum in the world, there are countless incarnations of him. The Third Republic of France has come to an end. If someone writes a history of the Fourth Republic of France in the future, Léon Blum should be the first person mentioned in the introduction. General De Gaulle founded the Fourth Republic, but when De Gaulle became weary of traditional democratic politics, Léon Blum, with his prestige, seniority, and political skill sufficient to rival De Gaulle, drove De Gaulle away. Although this case was not done by Léon himself, it arose from the Socialist Party's open opposition to De Gaulle. Léon Blum himself said: "The French Socialist Party has never had a strict organization, a core function, or a party discipline. The Socialist Party has become a party through spiritual infusion and shared political views." What views? In economics, they advocate reforming capitalism, singing the praises of the left, but "they are democratic and oppose the Communist Party's violent methods." Therefore, they are always "peacemakers," a bridge between two conflicting ideologies.

The reason why the Fourth Republic of France is able to become "one of the Four Powers" today is due to the use of a bridging model, both domestically and internationally. Foreign Minister Bidault, although not affiliated with the Socialist Party, Bidault's diplomacy is infused with the spirit of Léon Blum. Today, the President of France, Auriol, a veteran of the Socialist Party and former Speaker of the Senate, has recently gone on a tour of Africa. Prime Minister Ramadier, a major general promoted by Léon, is handsome with a flowing beard and is skilled in handling matters in multiple ways. Ramadier's cabinet is a mixed bag. There are many arguments at every cabinet meeting, but Ramadier's "bridge" can connect different views.

Wallace Arrives in France, Departs Hastily

When Wallace visited France, the Socialist Party government expressed a warm welcome. Wallace stayed at the Hotel George V near the Arc de Triomphe. He originally planned to give a series of public speeches, but later, for some unknown reason, he flew back to the United States in a hurry. Before Wallace left, Léon Blum invited him to dinner, and the celebrities of the Socialist Party were all in attendance. During the meal, Wallace spoke about his views on the current world situation and expressed his admiration for Léon's steadfast socialist position. It is said that Léon only smiled at Wallace. Finally, the seventy-six-year-old man advised Wallace to raise a thousand chickens after returning to the United States. Léon said that he had a chicken farm at home with a total of more than two thousand chickens. "Raising chickens is not only profitable but also good for the mind and body." Wallace saw which way the wind was blowing and followed the wise master, speaking about his knowledge of chicken farming from his agricultural science studies. The next day, Wallace left in a hurry.

At his first press conference after returning to New York, Wallace raised the issue of "the crisis of civil war in France." Parisian newspapers carried it with small headlines. The newspaper "Le Figaro," which supported De Gaulle, also made a sarcastic criticism of Wallace, calling him "naive and superficial." On that same day, Herriot's "Radical Socialist Party" telegraphed its support for De Gaulle.

Herriot Returns Home, Re-raises the Flag

In Chinese transliterations, Herriot and Auriol are truly a confusing mess. My French colleagues often laugh at my inability to distinguish them. I am reminded of what John Gunther said in "Inside Asia" about how difficult it was to distinguish "Chen Cheng and Zhang Qun." Auriol is the current President of France from the Socialist Party. Herriot is the former Prime Minister and leader of the Radical Socialist Party. After the First World War, he was a "red-hot" figure in the Third Republic for several years. After the Nazis attacked Paris, Herriot was arrested and imprisoned near Berlin. Herriot said in one of his "autobiographies" that he hoped every day that Allied planes would bomb Berlin. "I have only an old, useless body left. Even if I am bombed to death, I would be willing!" But he did not die. On the day Soviet troops entered Berlin, he was transported to Moscow by a Russian military plane.

After spending some time in Moscow, Herriot returned to France and re-raised the flag of his "Radical Socialist Party" and also attracted many small parties and factions. He formed an organization called the "Left Republican Union." The French say that Herriot's "left" wing is a sham, that he is neither "radical" nor "socialist." He is purely a capitalist traditional democratic party with few members. It occupies only sixty-six seats of the six hundred and nineteen seats in the National Assembly.

The "Left Republican Union" also participated in the current cabinet. Initially, it had made vows and pledges to support Prime Minister Ramadier's rise to power. However, because its position in the cabinet was not important enough, it was more accurate to call it "in the opposition" than "in power." Those in the opposition are more likely to be dissatisfied with the status quo, while De Gaulle, with his lofty prestige, is raising the banner of overturning the status quo.

The Communist Party Uses its Skills to Strike at De Gaulle

The most vehement opposition to De Gaulle naturally comes from the Communist Party and the "General Confederation of Labour" controlled by the Communist Party. The Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" uses all means to attack De Gaulle's resurgence. It says that he is "colluding" with the big arms dealer Schneider, that he is inciting military rebellion, and that he is creating a repeat of the "February 6th" riot of 1935. (Note: On February 6th, 1935, French fascist elements staged a major riot. It is said that the riot was presided over by Marshal Pétain. The rioters wanted to set fire to the National Assembly, and order was disrupted from the National Opera House to the Place de la Concorde. Later, the police opened fire to disperse the crowd.) It even says that he was bribed to pardon Marshal Pétain's death sentence that year.

In the past week, the Socialist Party's attitude has been more cunning and more mature. As I said before, the Socialist Party does not have a strong party organization, a core cadre, or a party disciplinary organization. Its opposition to De Gaulle is an opposition to his denial of the current constitution and his attacks on democratic party politics, not an opposition to De Gaulle himself and his supporters. In other words, if De Gaulle's new organization is able to follow the "constitutional norms" of the French Third Republic for sixty-five years to run for election, the Socialist Party can still recognize him as a friend.

Only with such an "all things to all people" approach can the Socialist Party always be a "peacemaker" or a "third party" in the national government, that is, always occupying a position in the French government. As for what major achievements the Socialist Party has made, the French find it difficult to say. The first Socialist Party Prime Minister after De Gaulle's resignation, Gouin, is now facing a "corruption" lawsuit, accused of colluding with French wine merchants to evade national taxes. Wine is a major business in France. Before the war, France's annual wine exports could bring in a large amount of foreign exchange. Since the liberation of Paris, it is said that most of the French wine has been "sold domestically." The current Prime Minister, Ramadier, is planning to levy heavy taxes on domestic sales of wine and perfume to increase the quantity of exports.

The Popular Republican Movement Takes New Measures

The party that has made a 180-degree turn this time is the Popular Republican Movement, the third largest party in France. In the past, it not only supported De Gaulle but also directly accepted De Gaulle's leadership. In the left-right division of French party politics, the Popular Republican Movement belongs to the right wing because the party itself has a strong Catholic religious flavor, so its "anti-communist" color is also more distinct. After De Gaulle withdrew from the political stage, the representative of the Popular Republican Movement was Bidault. Bidault has always supported the "constitutional norms," so there have been differences of opinion between De Gaulle and Bidault. After De Gaulle's new party was formed, many people in the "Popular Republican Movement" defected to De Gaulle's "Grand Rally." The former Minister of Armaments of the French cabinet (or Minister of Munitions), Michelet, and the younger brother of the current French Minister of the Army, Florelle, a key member of the Popular Republican Movement, formally announced their participation in De Gaulle's new organization.

Reality prompted the Popular Republican Movement to take new measures. Its central party headquarters announced that anyone who participates in De Gaulle's organization will be expelled from the party. Thus, some left, and some stayed. French political commentators observe that the MRP (Popular Republican Movement) will no longer have a future because it has lost its "right-wing" importance, although it is now one of the "three pillars" of the cabinet.

In any case, General De Gaulle himself is admirable. A typical French soldier, an absolute patriot. We outsiders find it difficult to criticize who is right and who is wrong in French political views, but De Gaulle's motives, his vigilance against the tragedy of the late Third Republic, seem to us observers to be necessary in fact.

British Reporter Comments: French Politics are Chaotic

In Paris, I met the diplomatic correspondent for the London Times, Maxey Morrow. We talked about the chaotic situation on the French political stage. Morrow has never had much hope for the French coalition government. He could not understand why Britain, the United States, and France, all democracies with party politics, are so different from each other. He also believes that France's current chaotic party politics will increase the "centrifugal force" of the people and make it impossible to control the "French Empire" overseas! Later, I saw in the London Times that his telegrams also said this!

### Henry Moore, Retiring, and Hong Kong's Deformed Prosperity

— Hong Kong Airmail News on the 10th, by Our Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng

Post-victory Hong Kong has not only restored its pre-war prosperity, but has become even more prosperous than before the war. Because the domestic political situation cannot be stabilized and the economic crisis is deepening day by day, the bourgeoisie continue to come to Hong Kong. Along with these people comes fleeing capital. According to reliable estimates, the capital fleeing from the mainland to Hong Kong recently amounts to more than one hundred billion per month. This enormous sum directly causes economic chaos in the mainland and indirectly fuels Hong Kong's deformed prosperity.

Although legitimate businesses are suffering a recession, banks in Hong Kong are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. There are now thirty Chinese-owned banks, and one hundred and seventy-one similar financial firms. The number of banks and financial firms in preparation is even more difficult to estimate. Their main business is buying and selling telegraphic transfers, in other words, acting as intermediaries for capital flight. Bank deposits are also increasing rapidly. With so much mobile capital and no proper outlet, the only result is to go down the path of "speculation". In Hong Kong's financial market, following the trends of "speculators," great disturbances are caused from time to time. The price of gold has been hovering around $265 for a long time, with little movement. Currently, the target of "speculators" has shifted to Saigon paper and stocks.

Hong Kong's population has already reached a record high of 1.7 million and is still increasing. The housing shortage is also becoming increasingly serious. Although the government has explicitly banned the collection of "key money" (premium for renting), the "key money" for an ordinary house is still about HK$3,000 to 4,000, and for a more luxurious one, it is HK$30,000 to 50,000. No matter how high the "key money" is, there are still people rushing to pay it!

Office space in Central is even more in short supply. The "key money" for a room is usually HK$15,000, and a telephone line costs an additional HK$3,000 to 4,000. Wealthy merchants and tycoons from Shanghai all want a spacious and luxurious office. Everyone is bidding high prices, and the "key money" is naturally soaring day by day. In order to meet the urgent need for office space, some real estate companies have come up with the innovative idea of developing upwards. The Princess Building, originally seven stories, is now being expanded by three stories. The Shell Building is quickly catching up and is also undergoing major construction. The most ridiculous thing is that the rooftop structures are not even concrete yet, but the office space has already been fully booked.

Recently, a piece of Chinese government-owned land, located at the intersection of Queen's Road Central and D'Aguilar Street, next to HSBC Bank, is the most ideal location in the Central business district. On the day of the auction, the Bank of China and Sir Robert Ho Tung competed to buy it. As a result, the Bank of China defeated Robert Ho Tung with a high price of $3,745,000, becoming the owner of this triangular plot of land. The average price per square inch of land was $250, almost equivalent to one tael of gold, which has to be considered an astonishing feat. They are now planning to build a Bank of China Building even grander than the HSBC Bank building, with a construction cost estimated at over $3 million and a completion time of thirty months. The Bank of China will use the lower two floors for its own purposes. The Hong Kong government has already booked half of all the office space for a term of five years, and the rest has also been eagerly booked by various government agencies stationed in Hong Kong. Needless to say, it was fully booked long ago. In order to balance revenue and expenditure, the Hong Kong government has decided to levy income tax. Various sectors of Hong Kong and Kowloon, due to the cumbersome procedures and incompatibility with business practices, have specially organized a Committee Against Direct Taxation, resolutely opposing it. They submitted three petitions to the Hong Kong government, sent two urgent telegrams to the British government to appeal, and also met with Governor Henry Moore to make a direct appeal. They also launched a campaign to have all the stores in Hong Kong affix their seals in protest. As a result, the Legislative Council still passed the bill by a vote of thirteen to three. Although the anti-tax committee represented the vast majority of taxpayers, their "public opinion" failed to achieve victory. The anti-tax committee also disbanded to adapt to the situation. It is said that interest, profits, and salaries taxes will be levied in September of this year, and property tax may be implemented earlier. According to the new tax regulations, single people with an annual income of less than $7,000 do not need to pay tax, and married people without children with an annual income of less than $12,000 do not need to pay tax. According to the general salary level, it is estimated that very few Chinese will have to pay income tax.

Governor Moore's retirement is scheduled for the 16th of this month, when he will return to England by ship. These days, the whole of Hong Kong is in a mood of reluctant farewell. Of all the past governors of Hong Kong, Governor Moore was very unfortunate. He had not been in office long before the Pacific War broke out. The enemy attacked Hong Kong like madmen, and Governor Moore's hardship and suffering can be imagined. Later, Hong Kong fell, and Governor Moore was also detained in a concentration camp in Taiwan, where he endured many more hardships. After the victory, Governor Moore returned to his post and personally rebuilt Hong Kong from the ruins. He shared the joys and sorrows of the people of Hong Kong, and therefore the people have a special affection for him. The new Governor, Grantham, will not be able to take office until July. During the two-month transition period, the Colonial Secretary, McDougall, will act as governor.

As the domestic turmoil continues, Hong Kong's prosperity continues to grow.

### Steinbeck's New Work

— Zhao Jingshen

The famous American novelist John Steinbeck gave a humorous answer to a newspaper reporter's interview: "You are welcome to write about how I write however you like. I can't remember what I've done myself, or how many works I've written. Originally, biography itself is half fiction." But we should still first introduce his brief biography.

He was born on February 27, 1902, in Salinas, Monterey County, California. His mother was a teacher, and his father was a local civil servant. His earliest memories were of words and people. As a young man, he wanted to use the former to serve the latter. In 1919, he wrote for the school magazine and was also a class leader and played basketball well. From 1919 to 1925, he studied at Stanford University, choosing the books he liked to read, so he did not get a degree after leaving school. He took a cargo ship to New York and worked as a reporter and mason in Manhattan. After returning to California, he devoted himself to writing. He lived in the Sierras for a period of time. He was once so poor that he couldn't even afford a dog. His first three books were "Cup of Gold," "The Pastures of Heaven," and "To a God Unknown." The total sales of these three books were less than three thousand copies. In 1935, "Tortilla Flat" brought him success. In 1937, "Of Mice and Men" further increased his reputation. After that, he published "The Red Pony" (1937), "The Long Valley" (1937), "The Grapes of Wrath" (1939), "The Forgotten Village" (1941), "The Moon Is Down" (1942), "Bombs Away" (1942), and "Cannery Row" (1945). In 1943, he went to Europe as a correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune. He is a pure writer. He criticizes himself very strictly and never hoped for great success. He was afraid that after becoming famous, he would not be willing to work hard to improve his skills. He was quite surprised that critics could not see the meaning of his novels. He has more unpublished works than published works; he continues to seek new projects. His latest book, "The Wayward Bus" (1947), is his longest novel in eight years.

This new book cannot be compared with any of his previous novels. It does not have the gentleness of "The Pastures of Heaven" and "Tortilla Flat," nor the fierce taciturnity of "Of Mice and Men," nor is it a tragic story of social struggle like "The Grapes of Wrath." You cannot say that this book is better or worse than his previous books. Every page shows Steinbeck's unique style. It stands on its own. His work, like Mark Twain's, has been developing his talent for twenty years.

In the past, Steinbeck wrote mostly about the cannery, doctors, dockworkers, and prostitutes on the riverbank in Monterey County. But now his background is restaurants and car dealerships, among tall forests. The car dealership owner's name is Juan Chicoy, and he lives with his wife. Steinbeck had wanted to publish this book for a long time, and he had been nurturing the nine characters he created in his mind for a long time.

What he wants to write is about people who are natural and simple. This theme has fascinated many writers. Since Rousseau, he has wanted to explain: when a person or family is thrown onto a deserted island, the noble and animalistic man becomes the emperor, and there are also love disputes, like Barrie's "The Admirable Crichton." Or like the adventurous Tarzan. Juan is a mixed-race of Irish and Mexican descent. He is also animalistic, but his taciturnity is restrained when he sees the woman he likes. He is a free man who is not bound by any kind of restraint. He can leave the person who loves him to the point of jealousy, or leave the business he has painstakingly managed at any time, wearing only a shirt, and start his wandering life again. Natural and free people are often found in Steinbeck's works, from the animalism in "Of Mice and Men" to the gentle and simple farmers in "Tortilla Flat." Juan is a strong, passionate man, knowledgeable about mechanics, and loves and understands humanity, especially when he meets women, like a bee meeting nectar. His wife knows his character, and she lives anxiously, afraid of losing him; if it really happens, then she will have to drink to relieve her sorrows.

Two people live with them: a girl who is madly in love with Clark Gable's movies, and she serves customers in the restaurant; and a young mechanic named Pippin. Four guests arrive and wait for Juan to take them to the western plateau in an old car during a storm. One of them is an honest woman, full of temptation, whose days have been spent being cursed, so she cannot find a job. People only want to rape her, not marry her. She has to use her naked body to show to honorable merchants to earn some money. After the performance, she drinks a large glass of red wine. There is also an honest woman who is healthy and greedy. She sometimes hopes that her parents will suddenly die. The wealthy Pritchard couple are going to Mexico with their daughter, so that when they return home, they can boast about their experiences. Journalists will ask them for photos, and women's associations will call his wife the light of women. This humble couple is written very successfully in the novel. Pritchard is a filthy, loud, and hypocritical man. There is also a customer who tells jokes.

They are all waiting for the car to depart. Juan knows that his wife has mental problems because he glanced at Pritchard's daughter. He knows that when he gets home, his wife will be drunk again. As they are about to arrive, the bridge is broken, and Juan risks driving the car on a dangerous mountain road that has never been traveled before. As expected, Pritchard's daughter falls in love with this primitive man, and Pritchard falls in love with the woman he once saw naked, the wine flowing down her thighs like purple blood.

Spring

Spring, she came herself.

She stepped across this land, and the land awakened; she kissed the lips of the flowers, and azaleas bloomed all over the mountains; she stroked the feathers of the lark, attracting swallows; she whistled by the stream, and the orchestra of water waves began to play; she, the gauze touching the trees and fields... all came to life.

She was also half-pushed and half-pulled into the city.

Women who are sensitive to spring, all bloom in the streets in a riot of color, and the swaying flower hair attracts swarms of bees.

And, look, jeeps bring peach blossoms from outside the city, and clouds of dust rise in the streets.

Is that how spring is? Is that spring?

I doubt, how can the footsteps of spring not step into that region of deep water and scorching fire? Why doesn't she kiss those weeping, tearful faces? Why doesn't her kind hand stroke the women who commit suicide by jumping into the river? She is even stingy with a smile for the suffering masses!

Is that how spring is? Is that spring?

I think, spring, the true spring of mankind, is still very far away, because ice and snow are still heavily pressing on our bodies!

Autumn

A red leaf, gently slid from the wings of the autumn wind, some sentimental people, their hearts fluttered, and sadness rose like evening haze.

Such a life is classical, like a beautiful dream, giving us too much imagination.

But, today autumn is still so rich and strong, not changed in the slightest.

This is a season we thirst for, we must greet her with the most excited heart and the most excited hands, our laughter, overflows in the endless fields.

Autumn, the crops are ripe. The ears of grain, like pregnant young women, shyly lower their heads. When the wind gently passes by, golden waves roll in the fields!

On the farm, the sound of threshing rises crisply, mixed with the giggling laughter of women.

When running past the door of a farmer's house, the fragrance of new rice rushes into your nostrils from afar.

The land is the most faithful, and the labor paid out receives the interest it deserves, isn't this the most ideal and happiest life?

But the landlord is already holding a scale, waiting at the door!

Just when the dreams of the farmers are just made round, they are lightly broken again...

Will there be such a day? Their dreams will never be broken!

### Wang Yachen's Painting Exhibition

— Hua Lin

Qi Baishi has a poem "Xijiangyue" to the famous painter Wang Yachen: "The lofty scholar in the clouds, his body away from the tiger's tail on thin ice." Yunyin is Wang Yachen's alias. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Wang shut his doors to paint, lived in seclusion, like Bodhidharma facing the wall, so his art greatly improved. For flowers, birds, insects, and fish, he is unwilling to put pen to paper unless he has observed them and experienced them. Although imitation has fine works, it is ultimately not the highest level of art. Wang's creation has become its own style.

Recalling 1920, when Wang returned to China after studying in Japan, he was already admired by the art world and enjoyed a high reputation. For thirty years, he devoted himself to research without interruption. In 1930, he returned to China from France and presided over Xinhua Art College. He applied the trends of modern art in European countries to Chinese painting. He worked hard day by day and progressed year by year. His art progressed with the times, and his reputation also grew higher.

Wang's technique is pure and skillful, and his brushstrokes are natural, without artificial facilities, which shows his lasting training and is by no means accidental. Genius must have long-term efforts, a peaceful mind, no desire for fame and fortune, no career without work, and no world without painting! For artists, the so-called microcosm is a world, and the world is a microcosm. These are the three tastes, not enough to tell outsiders.

### Tastes of a Mountain City

— Yan Zhewu

Dragon Entertainment

Having lived in a mountain city for many years, I love the dragon boat races by the Jialing River every Dragon Boat Festival; those energetic "Yong ghosts," wearing red, yellow, green, white, and black colorful clothes, sit on narrow dragon boats and row vigorously and uniformly. The dragon head dances, commanding the flags in accordance with the singular drum rhythm, and floats rapidly on the rolling river. The occasional ups and downs of the tail man, nakedly exercising, appear brave and adventurous. The people standing on both sides of the mountain city set off firecrackers to cheer, and the award ceremony in front of the water command platform, that kind of activity and fun is worth cherishing.

Similarly, it is also the "dragon" that is held during the New Year Lantern Festival, which is called "Yaolong Deng" (begging for dragon lights). Those who beg for the dragon, each with a piece of red cloth tied on their heads, and bare-chested, dance with the dragon lantern in the cold winter. The dance itself is not much different from that in Jiangshi, but there is a more stimulating custom called "burning the dragon," which is rare elsewhere.

What is "burning the dragon"? It is to use a special firecracker to release sparks, shooting directly at the body of the dragon dancers. People who are burned by the sparks are not allowed to escape, but only to jump and move in place, resisting the sparks; although the skin and flesh are painful, they must grit their teeth and endure until the sparks are finished. It is said that there is a superstition that this can burn away bad luck. In fact, this is really a relic of a primitive and barbaric custom.

There is also a kind of "splashing water dragon" which is also quite fierce. That is, when it is drought and praying for rain, willows and the like are tied into a dragon, and the "dragon begging" method is used to parade through the streets; the shops store water to wait. When the dragon comes, they scoop water with washbasins and splash it on the dragon beggars, basin after basin. The dragon beggars are not allowed to escape, but stand up and suffer; sometimes their chests and faces are splashed red. This probably expresses sincerity, so they can move the heavens and the earth. In addition, there is also a kind of "filial dragon," which is used as a funeral rite when a funeral is held. It is made entirely of white paper, and the "loops" are no different from playing with a dragon, but it is not played.

Mouse World

There are mice everywhere, but there are especially many in Sichuan. Mice are good at digging holes, and Sichuan mice can also plow soil, swim, and cross gutters.

In the mountain city, late at night, when people are quiet, mice come out to forage for food, and can "cross the street" in droves; there are also unfortunate ones who are crushed to death in the center of the street by car wheels. Dead mice with ruptured intestines can be seen everywhere. But the mice's ability to "steal" is also particularly great. Except for new houses, no house is not visited by them. His breeding rate is very large. Some people say that if no one puts them out, Chongqing can quickly become a world of mice.

The mice in the mountain city are large and fat, and their guts are also big. They can lick children's faces and feet, and they can also bite things hanging in the house, diving down from a rope; but sometimes they also fall to the ground with the food and flee in panic. Ordinary paper, wood, they gnaw everything! They also eat leather shoes; if there are peanuts or the like hidden in the pockets of clothes, they can bite through the pockets and steal them; things pasted with paste, they can also eat only the place with paste.

However, mice are cunning after all. The medicine for catching mice mixed in rice, sometimes he can smell it, and he doesn't eat it, but from then on he may never come again.

Because there are many mice, there are few cats. In the mountain city, cats are sold in cages; and people who keep cats often tie them with ropes and only release them at night. However, it is really good to have a cat in the house. He is not bribed, does not show favoritism, and if he encounters a mouse, he will definitely catch it and "play" with it until it dies. Many people regard cats as docile, ruthless, and fickle playthings. I think that in the years when mouse theft is rampant, cats still have their uses, otherwise a mountain city would have become a world of mice long ago!

Gong Announcements

When I first arrived in the mountain city, I was confused. I often saw people beating gongs in the street, and then a circle of people would surround them, listening to him chanting words, scholarly. At first, I thought it was a monkey show, or a storyteller on the street; later I learned that this is called "gong announcement," which is a kind of "living announcement." It is a way of promoting government orders left over from the peasant society where many people are illiterate.

"Gong announcement" is probably the duty of people like "local police." Nowadays, it is handled by the subordinate figures of the township office and baojia (system of neighborhood control), but some are also concurrently employed as watchmen of the county government.

The gong announcer first obtains the announcement, and the主管 personnel tell him the content of the announcement. Sometimes he also needs to be familiar with the content and teach it well. He sets off to the streets and alleys, knocking the gong to gather the people. The common people have also gotten used to it. Once the gong is knocked, the crowd gathers to listen to him recite the content. If there is anything they don't understand, they can also ask carefully. After the announcement is over, three more gongs are knocked to indicate "completion".

This kind of announcement method is very primitive, simple, and interesting, and it is a small skill of governance that is worth promoting and preserving. It is a pity that it is rarely seen in other provinces.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 510

— Ye Jingfeng

"Understood, Miss!" Perhaps Tsurumi's overbearing manner was stirred by the challenging words "handgun" and "test," and his nature, suppressed by false politeness, became lively. As he answered, he turned his hand and abruptly pulled out the German-made twenty-shot Mauser pistol from his waist. He stood in the center of the room, on a carpet in a space more than ten feet square, as if about to perform some skill:

"Inside...the bullets are already loaded, but the safety is still on, please take a look!" Tsurumi waited for the woman to indicate her wishes before deciding what to do.

"Excellent!" The woman shook her head, feigning a gesture, and extended a plump little hand, pushing it forward in the air. "Keep the gun in your hand, no need to give it to me... Just raise the gun, whether you shoot for real or just pretend, it's up to you! I'll try to disarm you!..." As she spoke, she glanced at the four people present.

"!" Tsurumi seemed to understand a little: He suddenly recalled that the day before yesterday, he and Bei, the small (unclear) acted in a (unclear) performance. (Unclear) very much (unclear), for a while, as if (unclear), then laughed heartily! What kind of (unclear) is this?

"It doesn't matter if it's not turned off!" The (unclear) (unclear) said.

"Very good, very good!" Tsurumi also used his usual meaningless tone. He hadn't inquired whether Shouyi had such a younger sister. However, he remembered repeatedly mentioning the skills and achievements of Little Tiger and Yaoqun in front of Shouyi. Little Tiger's unarmed disarming was also one of the proud reports. This report was probably widely spread throughout the Hundredfold Endurance Manor by Shouyi, so it excited this young lady, who also came to test her skills and show off.

"Come on!...Just raise the gun, and I'll make my move!" She gave the order.

"I'll unload the bullets." Tsurumi became a little "effeminate" again; perhaps it was a final test for the other party.

"No need...you can even take off the safety!" She expressed her indifference.

With a "click," Tsurumi indeed turned off the safety. At the same time, he adopted a stance, raised his hand very quickly, hoping (unclear) a sound (unclear), the bullet was about to fly out... At that moment, the young lady seemed to leap out of the sofa: (Unclear), first moved twice to the left and right, still (unclear) toward the target, and then in (unclear) moment, the person had disappeared. As Tsurumi turned around abruptly, trying to find the target, he felt a sudden numbness in his forearm holding the gun. The hand holding the gun was empty, and the gun had disappeared.

"Here!" The voice was still crisp and sweet, with a hint of giggling.

Tsurumi used his skills, turning around twice in a row, which was agile enough, but he only heard the voice and couldn't see the person.

Tsurumi had also practiced jujutsu and kendo, and his skills were very flexible, above the average level of a samurai. At this time, he indeed showed his true abilities. He was seen leaping left and right, forward and backward, in this ten-foot square space, but he couldn't find the other person.

"Here!" She teased repeatedly.

After turning around like this several times in a row and still not seeing the other person, Tsurumi became stubborn and somewhat anxious. Knowing that turning around like this all day would be useless, he gathered his strength, built up momentum, and suddenly leaped forward, about five or six feet away. Just as his toes touched the ground, he suddenly jumped up again into a headstand, doing a somersault in mid-air. His body drew an arc-like line in the air, returning to the spot where he had just jumped off and landing steadily. This technique is rarely used in judo matches. However, it is necessary to learn this move when practicing to the fifth dan. Because when encountering a strong opponent, one might be thrown out, sometimes more than ten feet away. The mark of a good player is landing on both feet, standing firmly, without even a ripple.

### Hiring Prostitutes for Pleasure is a Great Theft

— Qilou

Four guests with badges on their chests and the manners of gentlemen hired prostitutes for pleasure in a hotel room, but unfortunately, joy turned to sorrow when the police station sent officers to arrest them. It turned out that these four guests were major thieves from Nanjing. Due to the strict wanted notices issued by the military and police, they had fled to Shanghai. They worked in Shanghai and continued to engage in theft, unaware that the police station had already discovered their whereabouts and arrested them without lifting a finger.

Such news is commonplace in Shanghai. It is no longer a case of "a man bites a dog" but should be classified as "a dog bites a man." However, news is always news, and it has its own newsworthy value.

Major thieves hiring prostitutes for pleasure can be rephrased as using improper means to obtain money and then seeking pleasure. Sometimes, these people even target the women in the pleasure venues as objects of theft after enjoying themselves. Not long ago, there was a case of wealthy dancers robbing dance girls of their jewelry. They steal to indulge in extravagance and, at the same time, because they have come by their wealth easily, they are even more willing to spend money like dirt and enjoy themselves desperately. After enjoying themselves, they have no choice but to steal again. This leads to a vicious cycle. The ancients said, "Abruptly in, abruptly out." In fact, those who "abruptly out" often do so because they have "abruptly in," and after "abruptly out," they are even more compelled to seek "abruptly in."

At a time when the whole country is mired in poverty, some people appear with extremely extravagant demeanors. If someone were to uncover the source of this extravagance, it would probably make those wealthy guests blush, just like those travelers who hired prostitutes for pleasure. Of course, not all wealthy guests in these pleasure venues are major thieves or notorious bandits. However, they may be petty thieves. They may not be (unclear) insignificant things from the past. However, they use the same invisible means to steal money from other people's pockets. They may not directly rob the gold and silver jewelry of the girls in the pleasure venues, but by invisible means, they steal from them and rob them. They even rob them to the point where they have no choice but to enter the pleasure venues. They are these extremely extravagant wealthy guests. When a dance girl is grateful to a guest for spending money like dirt on her and recognizing her worth, how often does she think that the other person is a petty thief and that she herself is the one being stolen from?

If she thought this way, she would definitely (unclear) that there are too few cases of people being caught like the four major thieves mentioned above.

Free Talk

### Lincoln's Marriage

— Peeking Through a Tube

Mr. Lincoln, the savior who emancipated black slaves, had a compassionate heart and great benevolence. However, his marriage to Mary Todd was a constant source of pain and torment.

He and his wife were diametrically opposed in terms of personality, aspirations, and education. From his letter to Samuel Marshall, it can be seen that he was internally conflicted: "There is no news here. The most noteworthy thing is my marriage, which, from my perspective, feels extraordinarily astonishing and shocking."

Shortly after their engagement, he wrote a letter explaining that his love for Mary Todd had not reached the point of (unclear), entrusting his old friend Judge Lidder to deliver it to her. However, Mr. Lidder threw the letter into the ashes and asked him why he didn't say it himself. Lincoln finally mustered the courage to go and tell her the news, which caused her to burst into tears. Soft-hearted Mr. Lincoln couldn't bear to see a woman crying in front of him, so he embraced her, kissed her, and apologized to her. That's how they got together.

Her married life was not very sweet. One morning, he and his wife were having breakfast together. He didn't know what he said that made her furious. She picked up a cup of hot coffee and threw it at Mr. Lincoln's face. Under the bewildered gazes of many fellow lodgers, he didn't answer or scold her. Until the landlady used a towel to wipe him, he remained silent. This unpleasant life lasted for twenty-three years. He always endured it with patience, never harboring resentment, and never mentioning her bad temper to others. He truly had the forgiving heart of Jesus.

### The Comprehensive Examination and the Final Examination

— Shen Kan

"Ten years of hard study under the window, learning has been completed, and the temples are already frosted." These are the sacrifices under the ancient imperial examination system. The Ming Dynasty selected scholars based on eight-legged essays because the emperor at the time was deeply afraid of the people rebelling against him. Therefore, he used this stereotyped writing to wear down the ambitions of heroes and talented people. The Qing Dynasty followed suit, and our country thus gained the title of "Sick Man of East Asia." Today, the comprehensive examination and the final examination in our country's education system, although different from the old imperial examinations, are worthy of study. The author graduated from Fudan University in 1943 and went through the comprehensive examination and the final examination. Today, observing the results, I have not actually discovered any benefits. Generally, those who rank high in exams find it difficult to be optimistic about their future. This is because they over-prepare for the exam, exert excessive mental effort, and after their studies, their thinking becomes dull, and they cannot flexibly apply what they have learned. Moreover, their bodies are injured, forming a premature (unclear) state. It is better to list the consequences of these two types of exams and then summarize them based on the facts.

Now, let's talk about it theoretically. The comprehensive examination is implemented when high school students are (unclear). Its purpose is to improve education (unclear), taking China as one. However, each school has its own (unclear), and each has its own expertise, which should not be (unclear). (Unclear) to be squared and circled seems to have a reasonable (unclear).

As for the final examination, it is an examination held upon graduation from university. Examining various countries around the world, there is actually no such or similar education system. Generally, universities are specialized, and students also choose what they like and develop their own strengths. The four years of learning, until the senior fourth year, should include writing a graduation thesis. This thesis is the condensation of the essence of the four years of learning and can also be regarded as the crystallization of past learning. At this time, learning has been integrated into thought. Now, the final graduation examination examines the four years of learning, classifying and testing them, which is tantamount to disassembling the finished product again. There is nothing more unreasonable than this. The author's learning is unskilled, I only offer a personal view, hoping that the advanced scholars in the academic world will give guidance.

### The Usefulness of Friends

— Guo

So-and-so went out and didn't return all night. His wife sent five telegrams to five of her husband's friends, asking if he was staying at their house.

Before long, the husband returned. Following him came five telegrams from the telegram office. They all said: "That's right, he's staying at my place tonight."

### The Joyful Buddha

— Li Puyuan

Among the statues of esoteric Buddhism, the most eye-catching and controversial are probably the Joyful Buddhas.

The author has seen these statues in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing before, and this time, I had the opportunity to examine them in detail at the Ta'er Monastery. Indeed, all of these statues are incredibly strange. Some are still okay, but some, not only does the main deity have several heads, several faces, and dozens of pairs of hands, holding in their arms, or ankle-grabbing figures "similar to women;" moreover, they simply expose their reproductive organs. This might not be anything to the grassland people, whose views on sexual morality are not very different, but to us, who see sexual intercourse as very mysterious, and even the scholars who teach Neo-Confucianism are "too embarrassed" to bring out reproductive organs, how could it not be outrageous to the people of the Central Plains? No wonder some people speculate: The Yonghe Temple in Beijing was afraid that the emperor, who ascended the throne at a young age, would not understand sexual intercourse. The old princes were afraid that he would have no descendants and were too embarrassed to "teach" him, so they created these statues that demonstrated sexual intercourse, ostensibly as gods and Buddhas, but hinting at sexual intercourse. This is because the people on the grasslands do not know how humans survive, so they have to use these Buddha statues to show the reason for life and the seriousness of this matter…etc.

To the left of the Great Golden Tile Temple in Ta'er Monastery, right in the middle of the alley between the Great Sutra Hall and the Great Golden Tile Temple, facing west, there is a "Guardian Hall." The entrance is blocked by a fence door, as if it is unwilling to let ordinary people enter, but the incense burns continuously all day long. This is a large hall dedicated to enshrining all the Joyful Buddhas. The author, firstly because he was a guest invited by the chairman, and secondly because he got along well with the lamas, so he went in to observe again and again. Each time, it made me understand the absurdity of the previous legends about the Joyful Buddhas even more.

This hall is very similar in form to the Arhat Hall of inland Buddhist temples. All the groups of Joyful Buddhas are arranged densely. Generally speaking, it is already crowded enough, and each group, the main deity already has several heads and faces, and dozens of arms. In addition, most of them are holding one in their arms, and most of them are ankle-grabbing more than one, so it feels even more crowded. This is not counting the fact that each group occupies a (unclear). There are also (unclear) on the niches and (unclear) on the lintels—so people who come to visit the gods and Buddhas often have a feeling of fear that they will accidentally touch those heads, faces, hands, feet, reproductive organs…above and below, front and back!

The first time, I was also a little afraid. After a long time, I got used to it and gradually understood that these "guardians" had no intention of playing tricks on me. Moreover, referring to the "Shaman Dance" that I saw later, I know that they were originally spirits and monsters from the highlands. Or, when my Buddha was studying Buddhism on the grasslands, the spirits and monsters that arose from his psychology. They wanted to oppose my Buddha, and they also used their magic power to fight my Buddha. However, evil cannot defeat righteousness. Gradually, their magic power could not overcome my Buddha's power. Finally, they were conquered one by one by my Buddha's various incarnations. Therefore, they use embraces and sexual intercourse to express their flattery. In each group of Joyful Buddhas, the person being held up uses one hand to lift the skull full of fresh blood and offer it to my Buddha's incarnation (the main deity), indicating the joy they are contributing. Those who are being held, although "similar to women," are not necessarily women. Their original form may be the beasts trampled underfoot, and their transformation is probably the body of the person being held! As for the head of the main deity, it is a symbol of thought; the face is a symbol of emotion; the arms are a symbol of power; and the objects in the hands are symbols of magical treasures!

Each group is a dramatic story of my Buddha conquering evil thoughts. The overall meaning is "guarding the Dharma."

But, what a subtle and special kind of sculpture art they are!

### The Burden of Children

— Ding Xiao

"After marriage, there is only one year to accommodate happiness!" A friend said with emotion after seeing a wedding invitation on his desk. He had been married for a year because, a year later, he had a child. For the sake of the child, his wife had to leave her job, so they had to cope with increased expenses with half of their previous income. Also, they could no longer go to the cinema together, and they no longer heard them singing in harmony under the moonlight. Life suddenly became monotonous and clumsy.

Therefore, when he saw a wedding invitation, he had to say that there was only one year to accommodate happiness after marriage.

It seems that it was like this in the past, and it is the same today. Unless one can seize wealth by cunning means, most people have always suffered from the burden of family and felt that it was a heavy burden. Although some people advocate celibacy, it seems that one cannot help but have a family. Moreover, in modern times, many people are not afraid of marriage. Cooperation between two people is better than living alone. Assuming that both have abilities and have jobs, then the happiness after marriage will not be damaged by economic difficulties.

Therefore, the problem lies with the child.

A few days ago, I went to another friend's house. He had a house bought with gold bars, and he had a well-paying job. He had been married for many years and had five children. All day long, he was disturbed by the children. When I went to see him, he was really troubled by the children's crying. Of course, he had also been troubled by all the children's issues, such as education, food, and clothing. Seeing me, he said: "If you get married, you must never have children." This was an important supplement to his previous repeated urging of me to get married.

Therefore, today, rather than saying the burden of family, it is more concrete and appropriate to say the burden of children. Without children, a small family can generally maintain its good condition. Once there is a child, the situation will become bleak. This is also a serious social issue. Today, childcare centers are not widespread, and even if there are any, they are not in good condition or are commercialized. This burden will make a small family unable to move and will make the male and female protagonists in our small family miserable. However, getting married without having children is like climbing a tree to catch fish. No wonder contraceptive drugs and books are selling so widely.

Today, there is such a phenomenon that many young men and women of marriageable age are hesitant to get married and dare not get married because they fear life, especially the life after having children. But in the end, they cannot create a celibate era forever or an era without children. Nor can we let young people always sigh that there is only one year to accommodate happiness after marriage.

Then, the most important thing is to make this society so perfect that people do not feel the burden of children. However, if everything about the children remains the responsibility of individual families—the father and mother—if children are still regarded as private property and not recognized as the new generation of the larger society, then everyone will doubt the happy family of the future.

### Art and Literary Circles

### Methods of Criticizing People

— Wang Naizhi

While chatting with a friend, we talked about the recent passing away of Venerable Zhenhua and Fuhai. We were deeply saddened by the premature death of such outstanding monks. We felt that such talented monks had unlimited potential, and if they could live for another ten or twenty years, their achievements would surely be even more magnificent and illuminating for eternity. However, they suddenly passed away due to their usual lack of attention to health or contracting smallpox. This caused incalculable damage to the future of Dharma propagation, which is heartbreaking. Therefore, for the Dharma, it is a matter that monks should pay close attention to.

In connection, we talked about Master ××. The master was also an outstanding monk of extraordinary intelligence who died young. This happened twenty years ago. It is said that he returned to China not long ago and was (unclear) by a mentor. He was so angry that he became depressed and died. (Unclear), it is said that he was young (unclear) (died at the age of twenty-four). Even the slightest anger could not be withstood, so of course he was not great material. In fact, young people (unclear) be angry (unclear) again, the (unclear) is not (unclear), but (unclear) to be angry shows a lack of capacity, how can this be considered ordinary? I often hear people say that to guide people, one must have skillful means, and to persuade people to do good, one must understand the threshold of gradual guidance. To correct other people's mistakes, one must avoid pointing them out directly. I often made this mistake in the past, offending many people and (unclear) many things. I still thought I was innocent. My motive was to guide people to do good and to eliminate (unclear) delusions. Now that I think about it, it's really nonsense. How could I have even a little understanding of other people's views? How could I have even a little compassion and pity for people? I thought my knowledge was correct and that my knowledge was higher than theirs, and I naturally had the qualification to teach people. Therefore, after hearing other people's (unclear) theory, I felt that this was wrong, that was wrong, errors were everywhere, it was all wrong. So I couldn't help it, I wanted to do good, (unclear) him a little, (unclear) a little, (unclear) the other person's face, and also put (unclear) the air of (unclear). -A wave of justice (unclear), emotion (unclear), (unclear) the other party (unclear) to realize that he (unclear) is unteachable, I (unclear), no (unclear) scolding no matter how (unclear) to (unclear) (unclear) is very embarrassing, even more so for young people who love to be strong.

Some people say that good medicine tastes bitter, and loyal words are unpleasant to the ear. In fact, what tastes bitter is not necessarily good medicine. Arsenic and poison are also bitter. What is unpleasant to the ear is not necessarily loyal words; enemy propaganda and heavy taxes are also unpleasant to the ear. Conversely, the sugar-coated (unclear), which is not bitter, are all tonic agents sold in pharmacies. The Buddhist scriptures, which are not unpleasant to the ear and are full of skillful metaphors, are not treacherous words. Sugar coating is a means of convenience, the two and three vehicles, and the arm metaphors and words are all convenient. In order to pay attention to convenience, the Buddha spent forty-nine years, used all his skills, and said so many scriptures. The wisdom of us ordinary people, compared to that of the Buddha, is so vastly different, but we do not pay attention to skillful means and often directly scold people, still thinking it is compassion (unclear), it is really arrogant and conceited to the extreme. Knowledge is a kind of sin (unclear). The more people read the scriptures, the deeper their knowledge is, and the easier it is to see the faults of others. The clearer the distinction is, the stronger the impulse to criticize people is. I think (unclear) is not the expression of (unclear), but the venting of "anger", the manifestation of the arrogance that "I am more upright than you" and "I know (unclear) more than you".
