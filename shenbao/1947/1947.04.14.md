[Our Correspondent] The Chairman arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou the day before yesterday with his wife, and has been busy meeting local leaders and gentry, entertaining foreign guests, inquiring about municipal affairs, and paying attention to commodity prices. Today, he will go to Chung Cheng Park to inspect the 202nd Division of the Youth Army.

At about 6 o'clock, the Chairman and his wife drove to the Bund on Nanjing Road and the Jinling Road area to inspect the city's appearance.

In the evening, they invited Chief of Staff Chen Cheng to dinner at the official residence.

Yesterday at 11:15 AM, the Chairman, accompanied by his wife, went to the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road, where they laid flowers and paid their respects at the tombs of Madame Soong and Mr. Endner, and spoke kindly to a group of Boy Scouts who were visiting the cemetery, showing great affection. (Note: The Chairman's instructions on commodity prices can be found on page 4.)

[Central News Agency, This City] Chairman Chiang will inspect the Youth Army at Chung Cheng Park this afternoon. The 202nd Youth Army Division, originally stationed in Suzhou, except for the river and city defense forces remaining in their original defense areas to perform defense duties, all other officers and soldiers arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Chung Cheng Park was closed to the public yesterday, and the Youth Army arranged the inspection ground. At the entrance of Chung Cheng Park, a colorful archway about two zhang high was erected, with the eleven large golden characters "Youth Army 202nd Division Military Parade Ceremony" in the middle on a red background. The national flags of the Kuomintang fluttered in the wind above the archway, which was a magnificent sight. The reviewing stand was built on the northeast corner of the wide square inside the park, facing directly south. The national flag of the Kuomintang and the portrait of the Prime Minister were hung in the center of the stand, with the national anthem, the Prime Minister's will, and the twelve articles of the Youth Code written in regular script below. More than twenty pots of flowers were planted in front of the stand, and the stand was surrounded by blue, white, and red cloth curtains. The top was covered with pine and cypress branches, with the three characters "Reviewing Stand" in the middle, and the national flag of the Kuomintang above. On both sides of the stand, long flag lines of more than twenty zhang were strung with small national flags of the Kuomintang, creating a solemn, neat, beautiful, and dignified atmosphere. Today, Chung Cheng Park will be closed to the public for another day for the Chairman's inspection of the Youth Army. It is reported that Chief of Staff Chen Cheng will also come to Shanghai from Nanjing this morning to participate in the military parade. In addition, the 202nd Division will take special trains back to the Suzhou defense area in batches tonight immediately after the Chairman's inspection today.

### Syngman Rhee Visits the Chairman, Representing the Korean People to Express Gratitude; The Chairman Expresses Great Sympathy for Korean Independence

[Our Correspondent] Dr. Syngman Rhee, the Korean revolutionary leader, originally went to Nanjing some days ago to await an audience with the Chairman, but because the Chairman came to Shanghai from Hangzhou, he returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning, and visited the Chairman at Dongping Road at 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Counselor Stuart, our country's representative to Korea. The conversation lasted for one hour, with Madam Chiang, Mayor Wu, and others present, and Secretary Shen Changhuan acting as interpreter.

During the meeting, Mr. Rhee described to the Chairman the situation regarding the organization of the Korean government and the consultations with the U.S. government authorities in the United States, and expressed on behalf of the Korean people his respect and gratitude to the Chairman for his enthusiasm in assisting the Korean Provisional Government, and especially for the Chairman's full support for Korean independence at the Cairo Conference.

The Chairman immediately expressed his great sympathy for Korea's struggle for independence, and said that China and Korea have always been fraternal countries and should help each other and cooperate. China is determined to make its best efforts to assist Korea in establishing a government, and repeatedly told him, "Please rest assured."

The Chairman also inquired about the recent situation of Kim Gu, and Madam Chiang also said that when Kim Gu was in Chongqing, his friendship with the Chairman and others was extremely close, so she was very concerned. Mr. Rhee thanked them on his behalf, and said that Kim and he were cooperating very closely, and the Korean people hoped that both of them could serve as leaders.

### MacArthur Expresses Support for the Organization of the Korean Government

Last night, this reporter specially visited Mr. Rhee again at the Cathay Hotel to inquire about his meeting with Chairman Chiang.

This reporter inquired about the situation in Korea, and he told me the following:

Q: What is MacArthur's opinion on the organization of the government?

A: MacArthur is cooperating with us, and he also hopes that the Korean government will be established as soon as possible.

Q: Are General Hodge's views on the organization of the government consistent with those of MacArthur?

A: General Hodge's views on the organization of the government are now becoming consistent with those of MacArthur. He has also abandoned his previous claim that Communist Party members must participate in the organization of the Korean government, and stated that whether or not the Communist Party wants to participate in the government is up to them.

### It is Claimed That the Soviets Are Conscripting Soldiers in Korea

Q: General Hodge has announced to the United States that the Soviet Union is conscripting 500,000 young soldiers in northern Korea. Does Dr. Rhee have the same information?

A: What General Hodge said is very accurate and factual. The reports we have received are the same.

Q: What is Dr. Rhee's opinion on MacArthur's suggestion to the Soviet Union in Moscow that the Soviet Union and the United States jointly promote Korean independence and reunification as soon as possible?

A: This is what the United States has always advocated.

Q: According to Dr. Rhee's estimate, when will the organization of the Korean government be completed?

A: I hope it can be completed within three months.

Q: What is the current situation of the Communist Party in Korea?

A: There is almost no so-called Communist Party problem in southern Korea. Most of the Communist Party members come from the north, causing unrest.

Q: What is the economic situation in Korea?

A: It is very difficult. Since Korea was divided into two parts, South Korea has food and other products, but factories, fuel, and electricity are all in the north. The entire economic structure is currently in a state of "paralysis."

Mr. Rhee will leave Shanghai for Hangzhou today for sightseeing and will return to Shanghai around the 16th before returning to his country.

It is reported that Mr. Rhee requested Chairman Chiang to send a plane to send him back to Korea yesterday.

[Another Report] Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the Chairman and his wife hosted a tea party for Syngman Rhee and Li Cheong-cheon, Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Liberation Army, Chun, Min Seok-lin, Seo Byeong-ho, Zhang Shou-hyeon, Stuart, and Chen Guolian of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and more than ten other people.

[Central News Agency, This City] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou at 7:00 PM yesterday and returned to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. Around 9:00 PM, Korean revolutionary leader Syngman Rhee visited him and expressed his deep gratitude to President Sun for his sympathy for the Korean independence movement. The two also exchanged views on the issue of enhancing Sino-Korean relations, talking for about half an hour before Mr. Rhee departed.

### Part of the National Army Airlifted for Reinforcement; Tranquility in Shijiazhuang City; The Garrison at Jingxing Spares No Effort to Ensure the Mining Area

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] Official sources say: The situation in Shijiazhuang has eased slightly. It is reported that another part of the reinforcements and weapons have been airlifted to Shijiazhuang, which will help stabilize the morale of the city's people. At night, the Communist army's attack is still urgent. Last night, they launched several fierce attacks from the southeast, attempting to break into the city's ring railway, but were eventually repelled and shelled the urban area. Except for the Jingxing mining area, the National Army has withdrawn all outposts around Shijiazhuang to the edge of the urban area in order to defend firmly. In order to ensure the mining area, the garrison and county government in Jingxing city automatically withdrew to the mining area more than ten li outside the city last night.

[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 13th] The battle of Shijiazhuang is expanding fiercely. The National Army has airlifted troops to reinforce on the 13th.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] At 4:00 PM on the 13th, relevant parties contacted Shijiazhuang and learned that Shijiazhuang city was quite tranquil and that the loss of Jingxing was also unconfirmed. It is also learned that fierce battles are taking place on the outskirts, with a fierce struggle for Daguo Village. At the moment, the Shijiazhuang airfield is still usable and is home to bombers to protect Shijiazhuang.

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] Sun Lianzhong convened senior personnel from the Baosui Headquarters and local military leaders on 12.13 to issue instructions. Communication between Baoding and Shijiazhuang is constant day and night. It is reported that a strong National Army is awaiting an opportunity to go south along the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section to assist. Another message: The military has confirmed that Luancheng fell on the 11th.

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] It is reported that after the transportation on the north, south, and west sides of Shijiazhuang was cut off, the National Army contracted its forces to defend Shijiazhuang city. The war is spreading along the Zhengtai Railway Line, and railway personnel have been evacuated in advance. Jingxing and Weishui may have fallen yesterday. Huolu Lian telegraphed in urgency, and the situation in Yuanshi remains unclear to this day. In addition, the destruction of transportation on each line is extremely tragic.

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] The situation in Shijiazhuang is extremely tight. The Communist army pressed the suburbs of the city on the third day and yesterday, and the artillery battle between the two armies was fierce. Shijiazhuang is heavily besieged on all sides, and prices in the city are soaring. Commander Luo Lirong has issued a special strict order and implemented a general mobilization of the city's pacification work, cooperating to strengthen defense works. It is said that Shijiazhuang has abundant materials and sufficient grain for half a year. Luo said: The city defense is absolutely safe, and I hope the people will live in peace.

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] The news that the Communist army invaded Zhengding city on the night of the 11th was confirmed by the military on the 13th. After the Communist army entered the city, the street fighting was fierce, and fires broke out everywhere. More than 70,000 military officers and civilians within forty li of the city walls fought fiercely for five days and nights and bravely broke through on the morning of the 12th. The Communist army suffered extremely heavy casualties, making it one of the most tragic county city defense battles in Hebei Province.

### Sun Lianzhong Talks About the Battle Situation; The Beiping-Tianjin Line Has Resumed Traffic Yesterday

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] Sun Lianzhong told this reporter at 10:00 AM on the 13th: (1) The battle of Shijiazhuang is still proceeding fiercely. On the 11th, there was still telegraphic communication with Leicheng, Huolu, Yuanshi, Weishui, Jingxing, and the mining area. Subsequently, the situation was only reported on the 13th. (2) The main force of the Communist Army's Second Column has been fiercely attacking the northwest suburbs of Shijiazhuang and Daguo Village airfield for several days. So far, the defending troops have been bravely fighting back. The Communist army has continued to increase reinforcements and pressed close to the first-line outer defensive trenches of Shijiazhuang yesterday, and the battle was extremely fierce, but the Communist army was repelled by the National Army. The National Army at the airfield also used dense artillery fire to bombard the bridge east of the city, and the Communist army suffered more than 2,000 casualties. (3) Cangxian was previously besieged by the Communist army. After I went to Tianjin on the 4th to direct the repulsion, I transferred to Tangshan to inspect the pacification work in eastern Hebei. At the moment, there are still Communist troops fleeing in the north of the eastern Hebei Railway, and the security of the entire area is gradually stabilizing. (4) The troops of the Communist army attacking Shijiazhuang are mostly the remnants of the western Hebei campaign, and their combat power is quite low. The defensive works of Shijiazhuang are strong, and there is no need to worry about the city's defense. (5) The National Army in Zhengding transferred its battlefield to the vicinity of Shijiazhuang on the morning of the 12th.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] The Beiping-Tianjin line resumed traffic on the 13th, and the National Army is continuing to mop up the Communist army harassing this section of the road on the north bank of the Yongding River. The statement that Shengmang Town in southern Tianjin has been recovered is untrue. The National Army is besieging it and will be able to capture it soon. The local Communist Party has renamed itself the City Communist Army, with about three regiments, which often harass the suburbs of Tianjin. In addition, a section of the Pinggu Line between Huailai and Miyun was destroyed last night.

### Zheng Dongguo Returns to Shenyang

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo returned to Shenyang from Panshi last night. The Jilin Line is temporarily calm.

### The Authorities Establish Two Committees to Guide Election Matters; The Legislative Yuan Will Review the Main Bills Today

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] After the promulgation of various election laws for the implementation of constitutional government, all sectors are now actively preparing for the elections. The authorities are cautiously preparing the matters. In addition to setting up an Election Supervision Committee to preside over the matter, they will also set up a Guidance Committee to be responsible for guiding various election matters before the election, so that those elected are mostly virtuous and capable. This institution may be attached to the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association, or it may be established separately, and branches will be set up in each province. The first step of the committee's work is to conduct a general survey of the virtuous and capable people in various places.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The 321st regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 15th. The main bills include the draft organizational regulations of the National Economic Commission, the draft emergency economic measures plan, the handling methods for the official shares of the Small Four Banks, and the draft legislative principles of the Provincial Bank Law. The draft Bank Law has been reviewed and is expected to be submitted at the 322nd regular meeting. In addition, Legislative Yuan members Jian Shi and others previously suggested that the Executive Yuan explain the use of the 500 million US dollar loan, and the reply has now been delivered.

### Talks on the Reorganization of the Government Will Continue in Nanjing; Lei Zhen, Zhang Junmai, and Others Will Go to Nanjing Today

[Our Correspondent] Secretary General Lei Zhen visited Zhang Junmai and the standing committee members of the China Democratic Socialist Party at the office of the China Democratic Socialist Party on Yuyuan Road yesterday morning for discussions. Zhang Junmai is scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing today with Lei Zhen, and Jiang Yuntian and Xu Chuanlin will travel with them. Zhang did not go to meet the Chairman yesterday because he was busy with public affairs. The talks may be held in Nanjing. The China Democratic Socialist Party did not hold a central standing committee meeting yesterday. Zhang Junmai convened a lecture for Shanghai cadres in the morning, entitled "The Differences Between the Chinese Constitution and the American Constitution."

[Our Correspondent] Zuo Shunsheng returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou at 8:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It is said that because the Youth Party has representatives in Nanjing, he plans to go to Nanjing in a few days, and because Chairman Chiang is busy with public affairs in Shanghai, he is not prepared to meet him.

### The National Army in Northern Shaanxi Enters Jingbian; At the Same Time, Preparations Are Stepped Up at the Yellow River Ferry; Communist Army Activities Are Discovered on the Border of Rehe and Chahar

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] Jingbian, Shaanxi, was suddenly attacked by the National Army on the morning of the 12th and entered the city at 9:00 AM. After half an hour of street fighting, the city was completely occupied, and the remaining Communists retreated towards Suide. The Communist army in the Suide and Mizhi areas launched a fierce counterattack, and as many as six brigades of the Communist army sneaked into the Panlong and Yongping areas. They once counterattacked Qingjian and Yanchuan, disturbing the rear and periphery of the National Army. The National Army is counter-encircling them, and the two armies are engaged in a decisive battle here.

[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Ningxia, 13th] According to a telephone call from Dingbian, the National Army recaptured Jingbian County on the afternoon of the 13th, and more than 300 remnants of the Communist army fled to Nanshan. Ma Hongda arrived in Dingbian from Yanchi at 9:00 AM on the 13th for inspection.

[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 13th] The National Army marched towards southern Shanxi in two routes. It is reported that one route has already crossed Fenglingdu and arrived near Yuncheng, and the other route is passing through Yumen Pass and heading straight for Hejin and Jishan. The battle situation in southern Shanxi is about to change.

[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 13th] The situation in Shanxi is cloudy, and fierce battles are raging in southern Fen and western Shanxi. The situation in northern and central Shanxi is also not optimistic. More than 30,000 Communist troops who crossed the Yellow River from eastern Shaanxi through Hequ, Baode, and Lishi are moving towards Fenyang and the western border of Xiaoyi, stirring up trouble.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] The Communist army under Chen Geng has reached the east bank of the Yellow River. At the moment, Communist troops have been discovered everywhere from Jixian Xiaochuanwo in the north to Ronghe Miaoqian Ferry in the south, eager to cross the Yellow River. The National Army on the opposite bank is also prepared. At the Yumen Ferry south of Hejin, the two armies have already engaged in an artillery battle across the river on the 11th, and there are reports that the National Army has recovered Dongyumen with the cooperation of land and air forces. Chen Geng's move is obviously intended to cross the river to the west and enter Shaanxi, threatening the rear of the National Army. If he fails, occupying the east bank of the Yellow River can also increase the burden on the National Army along the river in Shaanxi, and prevent the National Army from entering Shanxi from Shaanxi. In addition to attacking along the river, Chen's troops have also left a part of the Communist army to devote themselves to the expansion of the eastern and western corridors of Shanxi. At the moment, the situation in Wanquan, located at the elbow of this Communist corridor, is unclear. Quwo Siguan has been lost. It is reported that a part of the Communist army has infiltrated the city, and the situation in Xiangning and Fencheng is also very critical. Jixian, Wenxi, Xiaxian, Anyi, and Yuncheng are also under siege by the Communist army. Hu Zongnan's troops are crossing the river from Tongguan to provide assistance. In central Shanxi, the Communist army is harassing Wenshui, Jiaocheng, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Pingyao, and Qixian, forming a semi-encirclement of Taiyuan, seemingly attempting to isolate Taiyuan, and attempting to prevent the Taiyuan National Army from developing to the southwest and cut off its corridor between northwestern and southeastern Shanxi. The attacks on Shijiazhuang in the east, the Zhengtai Line, Zuoyun in the north, and Youyu and Huairen in the right are all launched to isolate Taiyuan. Although the situation in Shanxi is becoming increasingly serious, there is no need to worry about Taiyuan. Relevant parties said: The four group armies under Yan Xishan are all concentrated in the border to defend Taiyuan, so there should be no problem.

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 13th] Military sources: More than 6,000 Communist troops under Nie Rongzhen, with heavy weapons, attacked Pingdingpu in Guyuan on the 10th and engaged in a fierce battle with the National Army.

[Another Telegram] The 37th and 39th regiments of the Communist Army's 13th Brigade sneaked into the border of Rehe from Baimaguan. On the 11th, they moved along the Heihe River towards the border of Rehe and Chahar, and a part of them have reached Datan, seemingly attempting to join forces with the Communist army in Guyuan.

### Shandong-Jiangsu Border Steps Up the Elimination of the Yi Meng Mountains Encirclement Area Shrinks

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 13th] The National Army on the Shandong-Jiangsu border has stepped up its elimination work in recent days. At 10:00 AM on the 12th, the National Army recovered the large and small Liangbi between Tancheng and Pi County, and at 5:00 PM recovered the outposts of Sihuzhen, Lufang, and North and South Qiao. Another mobile unit of the National Army recovered Hongshanzhen at 2:00 PM on the 12th, and the remaining Communist troops fled towards Weizhuang in the northeast of Yi County.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 13th] The National Army in central Shandong continued to tighten the encirclement of the Yi Meng Mountain area. The National Army, which searched and advanced on both sides of the northeast from Bianqiao at 12:00 PM, successfully recovered Fuma Well, Huiquan, and South Longtai, and captured many.

[Associated Press, Jinan, 12th] Commander Wang Yaowu said: After the National Army controls Dalian, it can cut off the main northern supply route of the Communist army in the Shandong area, and the civil war in this area can be shortened by six months. Therefore, the resolution of the Dalian issue is of great importance to the smooth progress of the war. We have received confidential reports proving that most of the Communist army's food, military supplies, and ammunition are shipped south from Dalian, passing through the strait to Yantai and various ports in northern Shandong. Although the government army's strength and equipment are superior to those of the Communist army, it is not easy to drive out the Communist army and restore transportation along the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways.

Han Biyao in Yantai and the Communist Army in Zichuan and Other Places Massively Produce Ammunition

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 12th] The focus of the war in Shandong Province has always been in southern and central Shandong in the past week. In order to realize its dream of besieging Linyi again and disturbing northern Jiangsu, the Communist army is concentrating its main force on the outskirts of Linyi, with an estimated 150,000 people from five columns, including the 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, gathered in the Yishui and Ju County areas. An estimated 70,000 people from the 1st, 2nd, and part of the 3rd columns are gathered between Xintai and Mengyin. The main force of the 3rd column, with more than 20,000 people, is still fleeing in the mountainous area around Liangqiu, east of Linyi and south of Fei County. After being besieged by the National Army for days, it has become exhausted, and its attempt to attack Linyi by dividing and combining, and to disturb northern Jiangsu again, will not be difficult to completely crush. In order to prevent the National Army from landing on the coast, the Shandong Communists have recently established a Coastal Defense Command. Heavy troops are stationed at various key ports from Jiaozhou Bay in the north, through Lingshan, Weishi, Jiushuo, Antongwei, and Linhongkou. In order to make the Yi Meng Mountain area its most powerful base in eastern China, the Shandong Communists have been transporting ammunition and grain south from Huimin, the seat of the Shandong Binhai Military Region, day and night, without interruption. In each transport team, all the large vehicles are often more than a thousand. Even so, the Shandong Communists are still insufficient and have gone on to convert all iron factories in Yantai, Boshan, Zichuan and other places into munitions factories to massively produce ammunition. As for the outskirts of Jinan and the Changwei area, because only the 10th Column (ie, the 7th and 11th Divisions) and the 6th Security Brigade are left, their strength has been sharply reduced. In the past week, there has been no major war except for small contacts. However, in order to avoid a coordinated supporting strike on Jinan by the 1st and 2nd Security Brigades of Fan Jiazhen in Taian Dong, Jinan's curfew time has been shortened, from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning, but the Jinan National Army is still on high alert, preparing for the arrival of the Communist army, and is ready to encircle and annihilate the 300,000 Communist troops in the south of the Jiaoji Road, west of the Jinpu Road, and north of Linyi with a well-prepared posture along with the advancing corps to the north.

The Ji-Xu Highway Will Open to Traffic the Day After Tomorrow; the Middle Section of the Jinpu Railway Is Being Actively Repaired

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 13th] The Jinan-Xuzhou highway is scheduled to officially open to traffic on the 16th. Since the National Army recovered various counties in western Shandong, the Provincial Highway Bureau has instructed workers to rush to repair the highway from Jinan through Changqing, Dong'a, and Wenshang to Jining in order to facilitate travel. After trial runs, it has been successfully completed. The bureau has now scheduled to officially sell tickets on the 16th. The passenger ticket price is 150 yuan per kilometer, and the freight ticket price is 2,000 yuan per ton per kilometer. From Jinan to Jining, a distance of 180 kilometers, the journey is tentatively set at two days. The first day is to Dong'a, and the second day is to Jining. From Jining to Xuzhou, there is an early connecting bus. From now on, in addition to air transport, Jinan has gained a land transportation corridor to the outside world. In addition, the Jinan to Luokou highway along the Yellow River in Licheng is also scheduled to officially open to traffic on the 16th.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] After the middle section of the Jinpu Railway was opened, the Railway Bureau actively rushed to repair the Jinan-Xuzhou section. More than 40 personnel from the Jiaoji Railway's car and station affairs department are scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 14th to transfer to Mankou to participate in the repair and opening of the middle section of the Jinpu Railway.

### Northeast Thaw and Spring Warmth Lead to Dangerous Conditions on the Shenyang-Anshan Railway; Communist Activities in Changchun's Western Mountainous Region

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] As the Songhua River thaws, the Communist forces have shifted their activities to the western mountainous region of Changchun. Recently, they have moved south from areas around Fulongquan and Changling, attempting to infiltrate Huaide and Siping to cut off the China Changchun Railway. However, the National Army is on high alert.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] The Pan-An Railway officially opened to traffic on February 17th. Among its 287 bridges, most are constructed with wooden sleepers. Now, with the spring thaw, snow in the mountains is melting, and ice floes are flowing downstream, creating a risk of collapse and erosion of roadbeds and bridge piers at any time. According to Wang Fengrui, Director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, due to budget constraints for reconstruction, immediate action is not possible. The railway administration has dispatched emergency response teams stationed at various bridges, using explosives day and night to break up ice floes and provide manual bridge protection. However, there is a constant possibility of disruptions and dangers.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] It is reported that Yun Ze, a member of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman of the Puppet Inner Mongolia, is currently in Harbin for important consultations with key leaders of the Northeast Communist Army. (1) Yan Baohang has been very active since arriving in the Northeast and is now the Chairman of the Puppet Liaobei, residing in Baichengzi, northwest of Changchun.

### Chen Jiazhen's Leg Injury Healed in Harbin

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] According to sources from Songbei, Chen Jiazhen, the Changchun Garrison Commander captured by the Communist forces during the "April 14th" incident last year, is currently residing in Harbin. His leg injury has healed, and he can walk without a cane. Also in Harbin is Li Zhengyi, the commander of the 25th Division, who was captured by the Communist forces on the Tonghua front.

### Domestic Assets for Japanese Reparations Valued at US$130 Billion; Total Demands from Various Countries Several Times Higher than Highest Estimates; US Seeks Priority for Liquid Assets

[United Press, Washington, 13th] It is reported that the United States' proposal for Japan to provide domestic assets for reparations to various countries is valued at approximately US$130 billion to US$150 billion. China's demands are similar to or higher than those of the United States. In addition, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, India, Canada, the Netherlands, and France are expected to submit their claims in the near future. Officials here point out that the total amount demanded by various countries, when calculated in currency value, will exceed the highest estimated value of Japanese assets by several times. The amounts demanded by various countries can only serve as a basis for calculating the percentage of reparations each country should receive. Officials state that there are two truly important factors: (1) the level of industrial capacity Japan will be allowed to retain; (2) the actual distribution of all Japanese industrial assets exceeding this retained level by the eleven member nations of the Far Eastern Commission. As for Japan's overseas properties, they are not included in the distribution, as each victor only needs to consider the Japanese assets within its territory as already obtained.

A significant amount of Japan's domestic liquid assets, such as gold bullion and other similar items, can certainly be confiscated by the Allied nations. However, the United States has declared that it is considering its priority claim to these assets to offset the costs of the American occupation, the costs of providing food to Japan, and the costs of lending raw materials such as cotton to Japan to restore its industrial production (these costs are expected to be repaid by Japanese exports and manufactured goods). Thus, the two can be offset as reparations, as the cost of occupation and food is expected to equal or exceed the total amount of liquid assets Japan can repay to the United States.

According to US officials, Japan is considering the following scope of reparations: (1) Japan is willing to relinquish all its foreign properties; (2) Japan is willing to relinquish all its domestic liquid assets to pay for the cost of occupation and food; (3) Japan is willing to cede all industrial assets above the level determined by the Far Eastern Commission to the eleven member nations of the Far Eastern Commission. If the Far Eastern Commission adopts the United States' proposal in its meeting, the level of Japanese reparations should be 10% less than the amount proposed in the Pauley Report of early 1946, but 15% more than the amount in the final report Pauley presented in mid-1946. As for the total amount of Japanese assets available for reparations, no clear agreement has been reached to date. Officials here believe that the most reliable estimate can only be obtained after officials from the State Department and the War Department in Washington, D.C., jointly consult with officials from the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan who have come here to discuss the matter.

### Rapid Expansion of Japanese Textile Industry; China Will Be Severely Affected; Huang Yuanbin Suggests Limiting the Number of Japanese Spindles

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Economic circles here are quite concerned about the rapid expansion of the Japanese textile industry after the war (this industry is one of the light industries that the Allied Headquarters has already decided Japan should retain). Due to the heavy losses suffered by Chinese textile factories during the war and their continued backwardness, there is a deep fear that Japanese textiles may re-enter the Far Eastern market, including China, and be manipulated by them, as was the case before the war. Huang Yuanbin, an important figure in the Economic Policy Committee who drafted the emergency economic measures in mid-February, warned of the danger of Japan resuming high-pressure competition, stating that this would severely hit China's war-torn and yet-to-recover textile industry. He pointed out that Japanese spinning mills currently have 3 million spindles back in operation, with another 3 million spindles ready to be put into use, while China currently has a total of only 1.4 million spindles. He expressed dissatisfaction with MacArthur's suggestion not to include Japanese textile machinery in the reparations dismantling projects, accusing Japan of retaining this textile industry as proof that it still harbors ambitions for renewed aggression against China, at least in the economic sphere. He revealed that the Economic Policy Committee is paying close attention to this situation and has therefore designated him as the person responsible for studying countermeasures. He suggested that China should promptly send representatives to Japan to discuss with the Allied Headquarters to limit the number of spindles Japan retains to the bare minimum. In order to prevent possible Japanese competition, China should raise tariffs and reform the currency system to establish reasonable tax rates. He also suggested that China's cotton production should be increased.

### Investigation into Diplomatic Representatives of the Japanese Puppet Government; Their Current Situation is Vastly Different from the Past; Engaging in Farming and Commerce, Among Other Pursuits

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] The diplomatic representatives of the Japanese puppet Nanjing government, who were dissolute and uninhibited during the war, are now in a situation that is vastly different from the past. However, the circumstances of most of them are still not bad. A certain magazine recently conducted an investigation into this group of diplomatic personnel (approximately 30 people), stating that some of them have been judged as suspected war criminals, many have entered the business world, some are still serving in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two have switched to agriculture, and some are unemployed and awaiting repatriation. Gu Zhengzhi, the "ambassador," is currently a suspected war criminal detained in Sugamo Prison awaiting trial. Yamada Otozo, the commander of the Kwantung Army and ambassador to "Manchukuo," is currently a prisoner of war held by the Soviet Union in Khabarovsk. Horiuchi, the "minister to Shanghai," is still in China, and it is believed that he has a good relationship with some government leaders (if diplomatic relations between China and Japan are restored, he is highly likely to become the first Japanese ambassador to China after the war). Kusunoki, the "minister to Beiping," has been unemployed due to his close ties with the military. Kato, the "consul-general in Xuzhou," has returned to his fields in northern Kyushu. Another consular official, Mochizuki, has also returned to his hometown to farm. Tanaka, the "consul-general in Nanjing," is currently working at the Far East Military Tribunal.

### Philippine Newspaper Improves Attitude and Praises Sino-Philippine Treaty

[Central News Agency, Manila, 13th] The Manila Post, which has been considered to have anti-Chinese tendencies, has now changed its attitude.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Nanjing Mayor Shen Yi often tells reporters: "I am an engineer through and through. I only have the ideals of an engineer. I hope these ideals are practical, but not grandiose." Mayor Shen previously presented a five-year construction plan for the capital to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. With confidence, Chairman Chiang reduced the five years to three years and ordered Mayor Shen to proceed with the plan. According to city government officials, this plan will begin to be implemented after May of this year. Mayor Shen may be envisioning a new Nanjing, with the splendor of a truly modern city. Mayor Shen said: "The new plan is a synthesis of all previous plans. The plan divides Nanjing into four districts: the political district, the residential district, the educational district, and the commercial district." The City Council has proposed adding an industrial district, which, if adopted, will make it five districts. The plan emphasizes the construction of roads and the reform of public utilities. The Executive Yuan, on the order of Chairman Chiang, has allocated 20 billion yuan as capital construction funds, distributed as follows: (1) 14 billion yuan for improving urban transportation; (2) 3.5 billion yuan for improving educational facilities; (3) 1.5 billion yuan for building public housing; (4) 1 billion yuan for improving sanitation management.

### Police Officer Causes Trouble in Downtown Capital; Mr. Zhang Refuses to Buy Ticket on Public Bus; Leads to Major Conflict, Opening Fire and Arresting People

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] At around 9 AM this morning, a certain officer Zhang from the Traffic Police Headquarters refused to buy a ticket when riding a bus of the Jiangnan Public Bus Company. When the ticket inspector of the company's bus number 22 came to check, Zhang still ignored him and said that he never bought tickets, which caused a dispute. After getting off the bus, Zhang, together with more than ten traffic police officers from the headquarters, carrying two Mauser pistols, waited near the Jiuguo Daily on Taiping Road in the downtown area one hour later. When they saw a Jiangnan bus passing by, they ordered it to stop without asking any questions and took the ticket seller and the driver down to beat them. After that, every Jiangnan bus that passed by was abused. This aroused public outrage and led to a fight. At this time, the police officers fired more than ten shots and arrested the ticket seller and several passengers. At the same time, ticket seller Qian Xiaobo, female passenger Zhang Xiao, and Zhu Yonglin, the person in charge of store number 430 on Taiping Road, were all seriously injured. At this time, the order in the nearby area was chaotic, as if facing a major enemy. All Jiangnan buses immediately went on strike. Later, the military police heard the news and went to persuade them, arresting Mr. Zhang on the spot, and at the same time persuaded the drivers and ticket sellers of the Jiangnan Bus Company to resume work and restore traffic. The incident finally came to an end at 11:30 AM.

### Correspondences from Various Locations

Hangzhou The eight counties of Hangzhou, Haining, Yuhang, Xindeng, Fuyang, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, and Wukang near the capital of Zhejiang Province have been changed to be directly under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government. The original First Administrative District Commissioner's Office has been abolished and will be closed at the end of this month. Commissioner Tan JiQuan will be reassigned to an important position in the Provincial Government.

Jiaxing The Provincial Government adjusted the administrative districts, dividing the seven counties of Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Haiyan, Chongde, Xiangxiang, and Deqing into one district, which remains the Tenth District. The Commissioner's Office is still located in Jiaxing. Haining County, which was originally under the jurisdiction of the Tenth District, is directly under the command of the Provincial Government.

Taixian Regarding the military administration of the four counties of Taixian, Taixing, Jingjiang, and Yangzhou, Commander Que Pengfei of the Taixian Corps Management District told reporters that the number of 2.75 million people used by the superiors is actually not enough. The most urgent task recently is to obtain the exact population of each county in order to plan comprehensively. In addition, the investigation of conscripts in this county is expected to be completed by the end of this month.

Nantong In addition to capturing many Communist soldiers during the National Army's recovery of Libao, two Japanese artillerymen were also captured and have now been handed over to the Suiqu District Headquarters for interrogation.

Ningbo The Xinhua An Wheel, which operates between this port and Shenjiamen, left Shen at 7 AM on the 9th of this month, carrying more than 100 passengers, including many fish merchants, all carrying huge amounts of legal tender. At about 9 AM, when the ship reached the waters off Gangmen, seven bandits disguised as passengers showed off their pistols. First, they shot and killed three escorting police officers in the ship, and then shot and killed a Youth Army medical officer named Yu Zuomo who was wearing a uniform. They then ordered the driver to sail towards Changbaiyang. At the same time, the seven bandits dispersed and began searching for valuables. None of the passengers on the ship were spared. The total losses amounted to 300 million yuan. The number of gold rings, watches, and suitcases was countless.

Wujin Xie Bi, the magistrate of Lishui County, recently went to the province to present the extremely difficult financial situation of the county to Chairman Wang and ask for instructions. On his way back to his post, near the No. 5 bridge about eight li from Jintan, the car overturned into the river. Magistrate Xie was immediately trapped under the car in the water. Fortunately, he was familiar with swimming and struggled out of the water, avoiding drowning. He was seriously injured and came to Wujin Hospital for treatment.

Lanxi The construction of the Jinlan branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was once suspended. The Railway Bureau, in view of the actual needs, has now resumed construction and is actively proceeding. The track laying is scheduled to begin on the 20th of this month, and the official opening to traffic is scheduled for May 1st.

Hefei Chaohu Lake, the core of the four counties of Hewu, Chao, and Ying, with a surrounding area of 420 li, has become a den of bandits in recent years and a corridor for Communist forces to communicate.

The organization has already begun and will soon go to Laoshan on Chaohu Lake to carry out patrols.

Jinshan The 35th-year farm levy of the Yuanpu Pasture Field was clearly exempted by the Ministry of Finance last year. However, in February of this year, the Jinshan County Government suddenly issued a notice to change the collection to land tax. People from the three counties of Songjiang, Fengxian, and Jinshan jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, which recently issued a reply with the serial number Yan Jing Zi 8728, which stated: "The telegram and attachments have been fully received and have been forwarded to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Jinshan County Government to stop changing the collection to the 35th-year land tax. Let it be known, this approval," etc. This shows that the Ministry of Finance maintains the original plan and is determined not to change it.

### An Impressionistic Record of Northern Jiangsu (II): The People Need All-Around Stability

— By Our Reporter, Zhang Shengzhi

"We need to ensure security and seek livelihoods in stability." This is the urgent plea of every resident who remains in Northern Jiangsu.

Under the Communist Party's terrifying policies of arson and murder, the broad masses of the people have been forced into family ruin and displacement. Social order has been utterly destroyed, leading to the widespread tragedy now seen across Northern Jiangsu. As we travel across this fertile land, it is infuriating to see the magnificent landscape stained with blood everywhere.

The people say repeatedly, "It is not enough for us to maintain stability in just a few spots, because the stability of Northern Jiangsu depends on the vast expanse of rural areas." However, let us also hear the opinions of the military authorities: "They believe that for Northern Jiangsu to truly ensure security, the people of Northern Jiangsu must rouse themselves; that is, they must achieve the militarization of Northern Jiangsu, so that everyone has a gun, and everyone rises up to defend their hometown."

However, talking is easy, but doing is another matter, and political work comes into play. Commander Li once said in a public gathering, "The Communist Party's only success in Northern Jiangsu is that they do good political work. They have organization, training, and unified action. From this, we can understand the reason why the Communist Party can still exist today; the main condition lies in this."

As for strengthening the ranks of cadres, this work has not been absent in Northern Jiangsu, but it has not been done well. As a result, the outcome is worse than if it had not been done at all. The word "malpractice" has harmed the entire plan; good people do not want to be district or township heads, while bad people fear they will not get the position. As a result, the people are caught in the middle, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, and unable to live or die. On the one hand, they are terrified of the Communist Party's arson and murder; on the other hand, they are afraid of the "bad ruffians" abusing their power, extorting and blackmailing.

Therefore, a subtle effect, which is also an extremely serious problem, has arisen as a consequence. Under the instinct for survival, who is not afraid of arson and murder? Thus, the Communist Party has seized upon the general weakness of people's desire to live and fear of death, and through coercion and temptation, has achieved its conspiracy. Because the people want to avoid suffering immediate losses, many people, under this contradictory psychology, are forced to join the Communist army. Therefore, the main reason why the war in Northern Jiangsu can continue to erupt is due to this never-ending stream of "militia members." The real Communist soldiers are merely standing behind the scenes, pulling the strings!

In the method of winning over the masses, it is clear that it has been quite unsuccessful in the recovered areas. The village self-defense forces we see, with a dozen or twenty guns, are all bought at a considerable cost, and not every gun is guaranteed to fire properly. Moreover, the training period is insufficient, and once something happens, it is not easy to take effect. But the Communist army, on the contrary, possesses a considerable number of exploited militia, many of whom are natives of Northern Jiangsu, familiar with the situation and the geography. During the day, they mingle with the people, gathering information; at night, they pick up their guns and become representatives of arson and murder. Even if the National Army has sophisticated weapons and fierce firepower, what use is it against these vagrants and bandits scattered over a vast area?

Let us also look at the current military force used by the Communist Party in Northern Jiangsu. Take the recent Battle of Libao as an example; the Communist army mobilized the nominal strength of eleven independent regiments. In reality, these many regiments were formed by exploiting militia. In this battle, the National Army, relying only on its superior firepower, suffered more than nine hundred casualties in vain. When the Battle of Libao was about to end, more than four hundred residents of Libao were taken away by the Communist army as they retreated, undoubtedly cleverly replenishing their military strength.

From this, we come to a conclusion, which is also what Commander Li said: "Why can the Communist Party use the militia to fight us, while we cannot mobilize the masses to fight the Communist Party? The only reason is that the Communist Party has a tight-knit organization in political work." Therefore, if we want to truly ensure security, the military and political authorities must be responsible at each level and strictly observe discipline!

I remember when the reporter group arrived in Haimen, an old man secretly slipped a letter into the reporter's hand from the crowd. Later, when I read it, I deeply felt that this was a consequence of "work not being done well."

The most important point is that the discipline of the local security forces is considered too poor. In fact, this is not only said by the people of Haimen; I have heard similar statements in every corner of Northern Jiangsu. At the same time, a few of the current township and district chiefs are "veterans of three dynasties," truly "experienced" and skilled at "corruption," able to manipulate things to their advantage flawlessly. The people once said with great pain, "We are not afraid of unspeakable suffering, but we are afraid of not daring to speak of suffering." Because the people are clearly suffering losses, if you ask them, they not only dare not speak, but must also endure the pain and pretend to be fine!

### Unveiling a New Page in Sino-Philippine Relations

The Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship has been agreed upon by both parties and is scheduled to be signed today in Manila by representatives of China and the Philippines. This will not only completely dispel all suspicions and misunderstandings between the two countries and unveil a new page in Sino-Philippine relations, but also provide a reliable guarantee for peace and security in the North Pacific. Therefore, the signing of the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship has great significance and deserves our attention. The contents of the treaty are unknown, as the official announcement has not yet been made; however, by looking back and looking ahead, it is not difficult to prove that the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship has very close relations with China, the United States, and the Philippines, and may even have an important impact on the entire Pacific situation.

The initiation of the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship dates back to before the Philippines gained formal independence. In November 1945, Duan Maolan, our country's Consul-General in the Philippines, proposed to the U.S. High Commissioner, McNutt, to negotiate a Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship. McNutt first expressed his support and discussed the matter with Philippine President Osmeña; however, since the Philippines had not yet formally gained independence at that time, it was inconvenient to proceed. In June and July 1946, our country took the opportunity of the Philippines formally declaring its independence on July 4th and appointed Gan Naiguang as a special envoy to attend the independence ceremony of the Republic of the Philippines in Manila, and to negotiate the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship with President Roxas and Foreign Minister Quirino. At the same time, in order to celebrate the independence of the Philippines, our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie also issued a statement on the same day, saying: "As we welcome this new republic, we wish to guarantee that the Chinese government and people will cooperate fully with the Republic of the Philippines, just as with other friendly nations, without any reduction. Sino-Philippine cooperation is essential, not only to enhance the well-being of both countries, but also to establish a spirit of mutual support in the Far East, so as to ensure world peace and progress." The Chinese government's sincere hope to conclude a treaty of friendship with the Republic of the Philippines can be clearly demonstrated in Foreign Minister Wang's statement.

The treaty negotiations between China and the Philippines began on July 7th of last year and were initially very smooth. The Philippine government, after discussing the draft treaty of friendship proposed by our country, also expressed its support in principle. In theory, it could be signed as soon as our country's first envoy to the Philippines took office; however, the Philippine government proposed two amendments to be added to the treaty: (1) that the contracting country, as a sovereign state, has the right to promulgate any laws; and that the nationals of the other contracting country have the obligation to abide by them; (2) that the Philippines should grant the United States privileges that China should not enjoy. These amendments were clearly contrary to the spirit of friendship and were not acceptable to our country; therefore, the Sino-Philippine treaty negotiations effectively came to a standstill. Although Philippine President Roxas still declared on August 30th of last year that "China and the Philippines should maintain friendship forever," the signing of the treaty of friendship was postponed indefinitely. Only due to practical needs, a temporary agreement had to be established first for civil aviation between the two countries, while permanent agreements required long-term consideration, and these agreements could not be produced first without the signing of a treaty of friendship.

Since then, the treaty negotiations have been deadlocked, and the Philippines' "unfriendly behavior" towards our overseas Chinese has become increasingly severe. We do not want to elaborate on this unfortunate episode between China and the Philippines, but we can summarize the various measures taken by the Philippines to harm the interests of our overseas Chinese as follows: (1) the Philippine National Assembly's proposed "Philippinization of Labor" bill, which forced overseas Chinese to employ Filipinos, accounting for 60% of all employees; (2) the "Philippinization of Retail" bill, which prohibited overseas Chinese from being retailers; (3) the "Philippinization of Vendors" bill, which advocated that overseas Chinese should not be vendors; (4) reducing the quota for Chinese immigrants to the Philippines to one-tenth of the original number. In addition, the Philippine authorities' atrocities against overseas Chinese, arbitrarily arresting overseas Chinese, and illegally searching overseas Chinese newspaper offices are too numerous to mention. At that time, our government, on the one hand, cherished the friendship between China and the Philippines, and on the other hand, seeing that a nation that had just been liberated from years of oppression was also embarking on this wrong path, had to repeatedly advise the non-government not to forget the contributions of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines to the development and prosperity of the Philippines over the past decades, and even more not to forget the glory of the overseas Chinese participating in guerrilla warfare and fighting side by side with the U.S.-Philippine Allied forces.

After our government's repeated advice, the Philippine authorities also deeply realized that future international relations should be an era of trustworthiness and morality, especially between China and the Philippines. President Roxas was most aware of this. Our country's envoy to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, returned to the country in November of last year to seek instructions, and after returning to his post, the talk of China and the Philippines reopening negotiations and signing a new treaty once again became widespread. Until February of this year, the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs suddenly sent a new draft treaty to our embassy, which overturned all the results of the months of negotiations between the two parties. As the saying goes, there were many twists and turns, and the Sino-Philippine negotiations were once again deadlocked. Therefore, our government had no choice but to issue a strong note to the Philippines, stating that under these circumstances, it had to temporarily suspend the negotiations. This wise measure was not only unanimously praised by our overseas Chinese in the Philippines, but also able to awaken the awareness of the Philippine government and people. The Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs then submitted a reply, stating that the Philippines was prepared to continue discussions, which our country considered; however, the discussions must still be based on the terms that had already been agreed upon. On the 9th of this month, the Sino-Philippine negotiations finally reopened in Baguio.

From the above, we can see how many trials and tribulations the negotiation of a treaty of friendship between China and the Philippines has undergone. Now, it can finally be said that overcoming the difficulties and reaching an agreement is a victory for the conscience of the Chinese and Philippine people. The peace and security of the Pacific depend on the full cooperation of China, the United States, and the Philippines; this is a matter of course and cannot be denied. Even in the current situation in the Philippines, although the Philippines has achieved independence politically, it still relies on the support of the United States in national defense. According to the U.S.-Philippine military agreement, although the seven islands of the Philippines are entirely built by themselves for national defense, the United States still retains its bases for its naval and air forces; from this point of view, the Philippines' true independence and autonomy still require a period of effort. We believe that if the Philippines wants to simultaneously achieve economic autonomy and political independence, cooperation with China to jointly maintain peace and prosperity in the Pacific is indeed an indispensable factor. Philippine politicians should broaden their horizons, use their wisdom, and strive to promote the friendship between China and the Philippines. We only hope that Sino-Philippine diplomacy, from the day of the signing of the treaty of friendship today, can truly unveil its new page!

The proposal also argues that Albania should also attend the German peace conference. The Soviet proposal has only received support from France. According to the US proposal, 53 countries should participate in the German peace conference. Molotov opposed the US proposal, arguing that the US-proposed constitution would include Turkey, the Philippines, and Uruguay. The four foreign ministers formally agreed that the German contract should only be drafted by the four powers that signed the German surrender. The Soviets and British argue that the appropriate German government should sign the contract. The US suggests that the treaty should state in the German constitution that it is only based on a peaceful solution agreed upon by the Allies. Milotov believes that the signing of the German government is essential, as Germany must have a responsible body to implement the treaty's stipulated terms, just as the treaties signed by its dependent countries. The Japanese government is considered qualified to sign the treaty, so why should Germany be an exception? Marshall suggested a compromise that Germany would accept the treaty when its situation was sufficiently developed to consider a clear peace settlement. Bevin was prepared to accept Marshall's suggestion. Bevin then asked if there was an agreement on inviting China to the peace conference. Molotov said that he had expressed his opinion, but no agreement was reached.

[French News Agency, Moscow, 12th] The question of whether China should be invited to the German peace conference remained unresolved at today's meeting of the four foreign ministers due to the strong opposition of the Soviet representative.

[Reuters, Moscow, 12th] The foreign ministers' representatives continued to discuss the points of contention in the German peace conference procedure this afternoon, but some difficulties have been reduced, but the principles remain unchanged. The most effective contribution was the suggestion made by the British delegation to divide the light and advisory committees into two committees. The members of the advisory committee should be the Four Powers, Germany's neighboring allied countries, and other countries that participated in the German war with troops, including Iran. The intelligence committee should be organized by the Four Powers and all other countries that declared war on Germany. The task of the intelligence committee is to obtain information and documents on the German contract negotiations, and the advisory committee can submit written opinions on this information and documents.

This proposal can properly resolve the issue of whether or not Iran should participate.

### Foreign Ministers Agree to Discuss Four-Power Treaty

[United Press, Moscow, 12th] The foreign ministers agreed today to discuss the U.S.-proposed 40-year National Defense Treaty on the 14th, dealing with the last difficult problem of the foreign ministers' meeting. At the same time, the foreign ministers agreed to return some of the German issues to the foreign ministers' representatives and the Berlin Allied Control Council for discussion, pending the foreign ministers' meeting again in a few months. This is the first time that the Soviet Union has unified this type of procedural issue, which shows that the deadlock on major issues will not be opened in this meeting. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France agree with the four-nation treaty, which the Soviet Union has opposed so far. If an agreement cannot be reached, the foreign ministers will lose the last opportunity for compromise on major issues. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall attaches particular importance to the four-nation treaty. It is said that if the four countries can unite to prevent German aggression, there is no need to worry about the issue of security, and countries will be more willing to make concessions on economic issues such as the Soviet Union's request to raise Germany's industrial level and extract compensation from current German production. If the Soviet Union refuses to sign the treaty, the United States' attitude towards this difficult problem may become tougher. At today's meeting, the foreign ministers also agreed to implement German land reform before the end of this year, destroy all German defense projects before December 31st of next year, and clean up all German wartime factories before June 30th of next year.

### Molotov Hosts Banquet for Yugoslav Representatives

[French News Agency, Moscow, 12th] Moscow Radio has just broadcast the news that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov hosted a banquet today for Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kartel and Foreign Minister Simic.

### France's Position Conforms to the Hopes of Belgium

[French News Agency, Belgian Capital, 12th] The Belgian Rhine Issue Research Committee issued a communiqué today stating that French Foreign Minister Bidault's position at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting on three important issues—the western border of Germany, the legal status of the Rhineland, and the legal status of the Saarland—coincides with Belgium's hopes. The committee believes that the Belgian government will be able to effectively protect the country's security needs in the above-mentioned three areas.

### France Demands the Port of Kehl

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that Foreign Minister Pidault's demand at the Moscow meeting for the Port of Kehl, opposite Strasbourg on the banks of the Rhine, was purely based on economic motives. The port is connected to Strasbourg by a drawbridge. France does not want to separate the port from Germany politically, but demands that the port be used by the French in order to cooperate closely with Strasbourg. During the occupation, France initiated the joint use of the two ports, and the results were quite satisfactory.

### Soviet Troops Reduced in Hungary

[Reuters, Budapest, 12th] The rapid reduction of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary, and the Soviet government's request to the Hungarian government to allow it to set up consulates in several cities in Hungary, show that the occupation state is eager to end as soon as possible. The first consulate is planned to be set up in Gyor, and four other cities will also be set up at an opportune moment. The total number of staff is about one hundred. Today, the total number of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary is between 50,000 and 60,000. During the highest period, it was estimated that the losses had reached 1.2 million to 1.5 million people. Hungary's burden of being occupied today is not very heavy. The people do not feel restricted, there are not many Soviet soldiers on the streets, and incidents of disputes rarely occur. However, those who want to go to Hungary to defend themselves must, in addition to holding a Hungarian passport, also hold an exit permit issued by the Soviet authorities. However, the inspection of documents is not carried out by Soviet soldiers, but by Hungarian officials.

### British Business Delegation to Visit Moscow This Month

[French News Agency, London, 12th] It has just been learned that a British business delegation, led by Wilson, the Minister of Foreign Trade, plans to visit Moscow at the end of this month to negotiate a trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union with the Soviet authorities. Since the end of the war, Anglo-Soviet trade relations have virtually stagnated. Until recently, the British Ministry of Food reached an agreement with the Soviet Union, under which the Soviet Union will import 150,000 boxes of canned salmon and 25,000 boxes of canned crab into the United Kingdom.

### Turkish Newspaper Clarifies the Country's Wartime Stance

[French News Agency, Ankara, 12th] The semi-official agency "Ulus" published today that Turkey was prepared to participate in the war in 1944, but the United States officially notified the Turkish government that it did not want to open another war zone in the Balkan Peninsula, which did not materialize. The Cairo Conference in 1943 was in line with the Anglo-Turkish alliance treaty. Therefore, the reason why Turkey did not participate in the war was due to the three powers, not Turkey itself. In addition, the United Kingdom did not fulfill its promise to supply Turkey with military equipment and equipment, which also made it impossible for Turkey to fight.

### Soviet Fleet Makes Long March

[United Press, London, 12th] Moscow Radio announced today that the Soviet sailing and steamship fleet will depart from Latvia, pass through the Atlantic Ocean, follow the Panama Canal, cross the Pacific Ocean, and return to Bolikhov Port in the Primorsky Krai to join the local Soviet Pacific Yuchuan Team. This long march of the Soviet fleet is unprecedented in decades.

### Danish King's Condition Worsens

[Reuters, Copenhagen, 12th] Danish King Christian's condition has worsened, his fever has increased, and his mind has become confused tonight. Four royal doctors are on standby to inject him with penicillin.

### Foreign Ministers' Meeting Has Lasted More Than Five Weeks; No Major Issues Resolved

[Reuters, Moscow, 13th] The foreign ministers' meeting has been held for five weeks and remains as deadlocked as ever. The only development in the past week has been the stalemate over the unresolved report of the Allied Control Council, which has turned into a stalemate over the issue of Germany's borders. The only agreement in the three days of discussion on the border issue was the principle that the Allies' land claims against Germany should first be submitted to the foreign ministers for review and to a committee of experts for study. However, the Soviet Union still insisted that the Polish-German border had been clearly stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement and could not be overturned and should not be included in the discussion, while the United Kingdom, the United States, and France believed that the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement were temporary. Another major unresolved point is France's request to incorporate the Saarland into its economic sphere, and Molotov said that further study is needed. When Marshall discussed the Hull issue at yesterday's meeting, he hinted that he hoped to re-discuss the issue of German economic unity after the agenda of the foreign ministers' meeting was completed, which shows that the four powers have not completely given up hope of reaching an agreement on this major issue. Some observers believe that this foreign ministers' meeting should at least be able to reach a resolution on the pivot of redetermining Germany's industrial level, because if the foreign ministers' meeting wants to frequently issue instructions to the Allied Control Council to enable the Allied executive authorities to continue to work on a four-power basis, the issue of industrial level must be resolved first.

### The Foreign Ministers' Meeting Decided to Abandon Discussion on the Issue of Germany's Future Political System

[Hezhong News Agency, Moscow, 12th] The foreign ministers' meeting decided today to abandon the hope of reaching an agreement on the issue of Germany's future political system at this meeting, and resolved to send this issue, as well as many minor issues, to the foreign ministers' meeting and the Allied Control Council in Germany for discussion, and ordered that they be completed before the next foreign ministers' meeting. This move indicates that after extensively discussing all issues, the four foreign ministers have decided not to discuss all the minor issues on the agenda, but to re-discuss the basic issues such as compensation, economic unity, and borders. The important resolution of today's foreign ministers' meeting is that the foreign ministers agreed not to mention the nature, form, and scope of the German interim government for the time being.

### Potential Crisis in Portugal: Army on High Alert

[Reuters, Lisbon, 12th] Thousands of dockworkers in Lisbon have been on strike for two weeks without returning to work. Other workers are joining in, seemingly with the intention of forcing Prime Minister Salazar to concede or resign through a general strike. The Portuguese army has been ordered to remain in barracks, ready to be deployed to suppress any unrest. Sources say that there is also unrest within the Portuguese army. Four senior officers were reportedly transferred to the Cape Verde Islands and Madeira yesterday. Officially, they were reassigned to positions there, but in reality, they were considered troublemakers and transferred elsewhere. Recently, several military aircraft were sabotaged at Sintra airport. Yesterday, telephone lines between Lisbon and the north were also cut. The government's response to the labor unrest and underlying turmoil is that it is being instigated by communists and hopes that workers will not be misled by international communist conspirators. The authorities are adopting a high-pressure policy towards the strikers, with armed police densely deployed in working-class areas. Anyone seen gathering in groups is dispersed with batons. Lisbon station is heavily guarded, and the situation in the factory district across the river is extremely tense.

### Churchill Praises Truman's Aid Plan for Greece and Turkey, Says Soviet Union Dares Not Rashly Start a War

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] In the second of two articles written for the "New York Times" and "Life Magazine," Churchill stated in an article on Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey that the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth would unanimously welcome the establishment of Anglo-American power in the Middle East. Churchill said that the United Kingdom is currently unable to maintain stability in the Middle East alone. He generally stated, "Accompanying the decline of British power is the rise of Soviet demands." Churchill believes that the Soviet Union will not attempt to realize its wishes through war in the near future. According to Churchill, the Soviet Union desires peace and prosperity, not war. Churchill continued, "If there is no significant opposition, the Soviet Union will be subjected to severe pressure from external forces and internal communist conspiracies. If the Soviet Union faces resistance in the diplomatic field, to the extent that it may lead to a major war with a country of equal or greater strength, in my view, the Soviet Union will not aggressively and forcibly implement its policies and ambitions in the coming years, causing the situation to approach the point of explosion." In conclusion, Churchill called on English-speaking countries to adopt a unified policy towards Soviet expansion in the Mediterranean. Churchill said, "May we move forward side by side in full understanding and friendship. If we split, we may all be fragmented and destroyed. If we unite under a world organization, we may be able to save free civilization and democracy, and even eliminate the evils of war from humanity forever." As in his first article, Churchill reviewed his policies towards Greece in 1944 and 1945. He believes that the policies he implemented at that time were identical to those adopted by the Truman administration two years later.

### US Representatives Stationed in Greece and Turkey for Fact-Finding

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 13th] US Democratic Senator Barkley stated at a press conference in Cairo yesterday that the loans granted by the United States to Greece and Turkey may be voted on by the end of next week. The delegation led by Barkley, consisting of four members of the House of Representatives from both the Democratic and Republican parties, is currently in Greece and Turkey gathering information about the situation in both countries. At the press conference, all the representatives emphasized that US aid to Greece and Turkey has no imperialistic intentions. They stated that the United States has no intention of seizing political or economic privileges, citing US policy towards China as an example. The only desire of the United States is to assist in the economic reconstruction of Greece and Turkey to stabilize their political situations, which is a necessary measure to maintain world peace. The Republican representative further emphasized that the expansion of Soviet labor must be curbed. They stated that the Soviet Union has annexed more territory in Europe than any other controlling nation, and since it participated in the war in Asia, its expansionist power should be curbed. It is reported that the delegation will travel to Istanbul tomorrow before heading to Greece.

American Aircraft Supply Turkey

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 13th] Several American Mustang fighter planes flew to Turkey, passing through the West Ampino airport. After refueling, they immediately took off. This is the first time the United States has provided aid to Turkey.

### Roosevelt Scholarship

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The Roosevelt Presidential Memorial Scholarship was officially announced today, to be awarded to international students in memory of the late President Roosevelt. The statement said that the scholarship will enable students from around the world to study and understand the American people and their way of life in the United States, and to spread their knowledge to their home countries upon their return. The statement did not mention the exact amount and the date of establishment.

[United Press, New York, 12th] In today's routine broadcast to the Soviet Union, the State Department had a program commemorating the late President Roosevelt. Mrs. Roosevelt delivered a speech to the Soviet Union, saying, "I hope that the terrible destruction suffered by your country during the war will be quickly restored, and that the rewards you earned for fighting alongside our people to defeat the invaders will also be reaped."

### Special Session of the UN General Assembly: 26 Countries Have Agreed

[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] The United Nations announced today that it has received affirmative responses from 26 member states. With two more countries voting in favor, a special session of the General Assembly can be officially convened on April 28 to discuss the explosive Palestinian issue. The two votes are expected to arrive on the 14th. Although the Arab League countries have not voted, it is reported that they will comply. When Ukraine votes, it will suggest that the special session be held in Geneva. However, the Secretariat has already begun preparing the venue at Flushing Meadows Park in New York.

### Truman's Popularity is Rising, Gaining the Support of Most People

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] President Truman is now in his third year in office, and his popularity is rising. Most people in the country support his new foreign policy and middle-of-the-road domestic policy. Truman's popularity declined in the early days of his administration. By October of last year, only 32% of the people approved of his policies, and the Republicans won the election the following month. Since then, Truman has regained his past popularity. Recent polls show that 60% of the people approve of his measures. Truman's renewed popularity is largely due to: (1) Defeating the coal miners' leader Lewis, forcing him to comply and end his strike against government control of the mines; (2) His middle-of-the-road domestic policies; (3) The appointment of Marshall as Secretary of State; (4) His successful visit to Mexico. Truman's plan to prevent the spread of communism is being supported by Congress.

Mrs. Bucci, a housewife, had breast cancer in her left breast for three years, causing her left arm to become immobile. She had been bedridden for two years and was on the verge of death when she was treated with the miraculous cure. She is now able to move as usual, and her left arm can also move.

### The Key to the Success or Failure of the Moscow Conference: An Analysis of the German Reparations Issue

— Special Translation by Our Editorial Department

Although the four-power foreign ministers' conference being held in Moscow is centered on the German question, this conference is unlikely to produce a German treaty. At most, the four foreign ministers will reach a decision on whether Germany should move towards unification or remain divided for a long period of time. It is even uncertain whether this outcome can be achieved.

United Nations diplomats insist that the four powers must first reach an agreement on current German problems before deciding on the future of Germany. Disputes that have divided the United Nations' occupation policy for twenty-one months will be the focus of discussions at the Moscow conference.

The proposal by the UK and the US to immediately implement economic unification in Germany will be opposed by the Soviet Union and France. The Soviet Union insists on first obtaining $10 billion in reparations from Germany. France advocates establishing a weak central government first, creating a loose federation in Germany.

Other obstacles include the difficult issues of eradicating Nazi ideology, disarmament, and democratization. The United Nations Control Commission in Berlin has spent a year and a half discussing these issues and recently announced that it could not find a solution. Without the four powers reaching a consensus, there cannot be much progress in drafting a German treaty.

Economic Unification of Germany: The US Desires It Most

The economic unification of Germany is the primary goal that US Secretary of State Marshall seeks at the Moscow conference. The United States has listed this issue as one of the most important items on the agenda of the Moscow conference for the following four important reasons: First, the United States believes that if Germany remains divided for a long time, the conflict between the eastern and western blocs will inevitably lead to another world war. If economic unification is delayed further, Germany will move towards permanent division, causing Europe to be divided into two major blocs, vying to embrace the Germans. Second, as this situation evolves, German Nazis may cleverly resurface under new guises. German nationalists are exploiting the weaknesses of the United Nations' divisions and the general public's resentment towards the country's fragmentation. At the same time, economic stagnation and food shortages in Germany are fostering the Nazi ideology that is still spreading everywhere. Third, the barriers between the occupation zones prevent manufacturers from obtaining raw materials and manufactured goods from flowing into ordinary markets, thus hindering industrial reconstruction. In addition, food, labor, and capital are all locked within their respective occupation zones. Fourth, West Germany needs economic assistance and raw material supplies from the UK and the US. The recent merger of the UK and US occupation zones has resulted in total imports of over $600 million this year, plus occupation costs of about $1 billion.

The UK and the US previously advocated economic unification of Germany on the grounds that it would reduce their financial burden. Surplus food and raw materials from the Soviet occupation zone could help revive industry in West Germany. This situation still exists today, but on a smaller scale, because Soviet demands for reparations have reduced the surplus exports from East Germany.

The United States believes that if Western countries agree to the Soviet Union obtaining reparations from current German production, Western countries' expenditures will inevitably increase, and the financial benefits that can be obtained from German unification are relatively small. Unless the UK and the US accept the Soviet Union's demand for reparations—at least in part—the Soviet Union is unlikely to agree to German economic unification.

Therefore, the reparations issue has become the key to the success or failure of the Moscow conference. The Soviet Union's biggest goal at the Moscow conference will be to obtain some of the manufactured goods from West Germany.

The Soviet Union Urgently Needs Materials to Make Up for Production Shortfalls

The Soviet Union urgently needs consumer goods, machinery, and transportation equipment to repair all the equipment damaged by the Hitler army. According to the Potsdam Agreement, the factories in the occupation zone have already been massively moved to the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet Union is extracting reparations from the current production of factories remaining in East Germany.

Because the Soviet Union refuses to accept the economic unification plan, it has not yet received any reparations from West Germany. According to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, one-quarter of the dismantled factories in West Germany should belong to the Soviet Union, for use in the Soviet Union or Poland. However, before the implementation of unification, the UK and the US will not ship any factory equipment out of their occupation zones. To date, less than one percent of the factories in West Germany have been dismantled.

Soviet officials now advocate that Germany should implement economic unification, but first, they require the UK and the US to agree to the principle of obtaining reparations from current production. Secondly, the Soviet Union wants to obtain ample manufactured goods from West Germany to make up for the shortfall in domestic production over the next five to ten years. The total reparations demanded by the Soviet Union are $10 billion, approximately two to three times more than the amount allowed by the Potsdam Agreement.

It is expected that the method of obtaining reparations by the UK and the US in the Moscow conference, after continuous implementation for many years, may cause a large part of Germany's and the Western countries' trade to be permanently seized by the Soviet Union.

The United States fears repeating the mistakes of the 1920s, when the United States loaned Germany to help with its economic construction, but the burden of reparations forced Germany towards inflation, economic bankruptcy, and nationalism.

United States Congressional leaders oppose any reparations plan that would increase the cost of the US military occupation. They argue that German exports should first be used to pay for the cost of food and raw materials shipped by the UK and the US to Germany.

France is expected to support the Soviet Union's demand to obtain reparations from current production in the Moscow conference. France currently prefers coal and manufactured goods to dismantled factories, because it lacks the technicians, workers, and raw materials to use the factory equipment until much later.

The UK and the US believe that the principles insisted upon by France and the Soviet Union will enable German industry to recover to a higher level than that envisioned by the Potsdam Conference, which is sufficient to deepen the danger of German rearmament. Years later, competition from Germany for markets will be more intense. However, Germany's neighbors, such as the Soviet Union, are more concerned about their current economic difficulties than these future problems.

The Gray Compromise Plan May Break the Stalemate

US Army Commander in Germany, Lieutenant General Gray, offered Marshall a compromise as follows: If the Soviet Union lowers its demands, supplies the raw materials needed by the United States, and agrees to German economic unification, then the UK and the US may accept the principle of obtaining reparations from current production.

Marshall is likely to seek a compromise between the Soviet Union's demands and the views of the US Congress at the Moscow conference. A plan similar to Gray's suggestion may be proposed as a basis for resolving the reparations and economic unification issues. If this is the case, then the four foreign ministers will discuss the procedures for signing a German treaty.

But it is certain that the Moscow conference will not reach an agreement on any of the treaty's terms. In this situation, Marshall is expected to quickly end the meeting and convene another four-power conference after letting it "cool off" for some time. Then the divided situation in Germany seems to be prolonged.

### US Senators Harshly Criticize Wallace's Speech in England, Accusing Him of Lacking Patriotism and Attempting to Oppose the Government

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The speech by former Vice President Wallace today drew unanimous condemnation from major senators. Republican Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said, "It is appalling for Americans to go abroad and make statements attacking their own government. I believe that the important event is not Mr. Wallace's actions in 1948, but his actions in 1947." This statement clearly refers to Wallace's possible participation in next year's presidential election campaign. Democratic Senator Fulbright said, "I don't know what his intentions are. This man's words sound like they were drafted in the Kremlin." Republican Senator Robertson said, "It is improper for a key figure of our country to go to another country and try to persuade them to oppose their own country's policies. I don't think the British will be fooled by him." Republican Senator Marr said, "President Truman should state that Wallace does not represent anyone, but only speaks for the communist rabble he carries with him." Democratic Senator George said, "Wallace's attitude is greatly detrimental to the goals of our country's policies. Mr. Wallace does not accurately interpret the emotions of the American people and clearly does not understand the thoughts of his fellow citizens."

### Wallace's Remarks: Says He Does Not Intend to Lead a New Party

[United Press, Stoke-on-Trent, England, 13th] Since arriving in England, former US Vice President Wallace has delivered his third speech at the United Nations Association, declaring that he himself will not lead a third-party movement in the United States. However, he said that the movement could be led by Democratic Senator Pepper, who is an excellent liberal senator. When asked if he intended to run for president in 1948 as a third-party candidate, Wallace replied that the state election laws have created a situation that makes it impossible for a third party to gain power, and therefore, no one dares to try lightly. However, if things become extremely conservative, a new party may emerge and gain considerable influence in one election, with the hope of winning in the next election. Wallace predicted that the Moscow foreign ministers' conference will fail on fundamental issues, and the upcoming international trade preparatory conference in Geneva will also fail.

[Central News Agency, London, 12th] Wallace, whose visit to England has attracted global attention, is scheduled to fly to Goteborg on the 17th and deliver a speech there the following day. His itinerary includes a speech in Oslo on the 19th, a speech in Copenhagen on the 21st, and in Paris on the 22nd. He will fly back to the United States from Paris on the 25th.

### United Nations Evening Program This Week Features Asians

### Reynolds' Round-the-World Flight

Took Off from New York on the Night of the 12th

[United Press, New York, 13th] Aviation authorities announced today that noted pen manufacturer Reynolds took off from LaGuardia Airport in New York at 10:11 last night for a round-the-world trip.

### Japanese Financial Deficit

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] The Japanese Finance Minister recently announced that by the end of the last fiscal year (March 31), Japan had issued a total of 24.5 billion yen in treasury bills and public bonds. The Ministry will repay the principal and interest from property taxes and increased income taxes. However, the Ministry admits that tax collection is slow, so the repayment will have to be delayed longer than expected.

### US Ready to Participate in Negotiations to Improve the Situation in Korea: MacArthur Releases Latest Report on the Situation in Korea

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th, United Press] Following Marshall's explosive remarks in Moscow that the Soviet Union should bear the responsibility for Korea's economic difficulties, MacArthur today released his latest report on the situation in Korea, stating that the US members of the US-Soviet Joint Commission are in Seoul, ready to participate in discussions to improve the situation. According to MacArthur's previous report, US Commander-in-Chief in Korea Hodge has made it clear to the Soviet side that the US firmly believes that the Korean people should have the freedom to express their opinions on the establishment of their own provisional government. Marshall pointed out in Moscow that the Soviet Commander in Korea insists on a principle that would exclude most of the leading Korean representatives in the consultation to organize a provisional government. It is recalled that US officials in Korea have repeatedly attempted to reopen the commission, as Marshall is now requesting in Moscow.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th, Associated Press] MacArthur stated in his latest report on the activities of the US military government in Korea that since the opening of the interim legislative assembly, the people of South Korea have completed "the greatest step in the democratic progress of self-governance." He also stated that the US representatives of the US-Soviet Joint Commission have remained in Seoul, ready to participate in discussions of all appropriate issues at any time. This indicates that the United States is willing to discuss the Korean issue whenever the Soviet representatives are willing to attend the meeting.

### Burmese Parliamentary Elections

Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Achieves a Major Victory

[Reuters, Rangoon, 12th] In the Constituent Assembly elections, candidates from the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League won complete victories in all constituencies in Rangoon. Observers say that the party can win 90% of the seats in the Constituent Assembly. In addition, 100 members of the interim legislative council will be elected and appointed from among the members of the Burmese governor's self-governing constitutional convention. The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League's overwhelming majority is also undoubtedly certain.

### Gandhi Suddenly Leaves New Delhi, Rumored to Disagree with Nehru

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 12th] Indian Mahatma Gandhi suddenly left for the province of Bihar tonight after a meeting with the Governor-General of India, Lord Mountbatten, yesterday. According to the National Congress Party, the Mahatma's sudden departure was due to disagreements between himself and Deputy Prime Minister Nehru of the Indian Interim Government regarding the future status of Jinnah, chairman of the Muslim League. Gandhi proposed that Jinnah be appointed president of future Indian politics, in order to force him to cooperate with the National Congress Party and create a unified India. It is reported that Nehru strongly opposed this proposal, believing that Gandhi was too idealistic and lacked contact with political reality. Gandhi traveled to Bihar Province by third-class train. This afternoon, he met again with French Chargé d'Affaires Roux, expressing his delight at the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and India.

Gandhi Jinnah Meet Six Times with Indian Governor

[Reuters, New Delhi, 12th] Gandhi has been in New Delhi for twelve days, meeting with Indian Governor-General Mountbatten six times.

Sources close to the National Congress Party revealed that the party has made a positive resolution on constitutional issues. League leader Jinnah has also met with the Indian Governor six times, but it is still unknown whether he intends to meet again. After these meetings, the Governor has a clear understanding of the positions of the National Congress Party and the Muslim League. Sources say that the Governor's efforts to get the Muslim League to participate in the constitutional assembly have had little success, but it is expected that Mountbatten will not be discouraged and will continue to negotiate in order to reach an agreement for India as soon as possible.

### Mayor Ordered to Suppress Prices, Convening Emergency Economic Meeting, Daily Necessities Not Allowed to Exceed Current Price Limits, Strict Investigation and Reporting of Speculators to Begin Today

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at 9:15 yesterday morning to seek instructions on the issue of suppressing prices in Shanghai. It is said that the Chairman is extremely concerned about the current fluctuations in Shanghai's prices and is quite angry at the illegal profiteering of unscrupulous merchants. He has ordered Mayor Wu to strengthen controls so that people's lives can be stabilized. Upon receiving the order, Mayor Wu immediately convened an emergency economic inspection meeting at his official residence at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. Those present included Xuan Tiewu of the Garrison Headquarters, Fang Zhichao, Director of the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Liu Gongyun of the Central Bank, Li Zheng, Chief Secretary of the Garrison Headquarters, Xu Yongzuo, Head of the Gold and Currency Group, Wang Zhongqing, Head of the Food Group, Jiang Songping, Head of the Trade Association Group, and Zhang Yamin, Head of the Factory Group. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting and stated that the issue of prices is of utmost concern to the citizens of Shanghai.

To date, more than 65 percent of the grain shipped by UNRRA to the Executive Yuan in China has been distributed by the Executive Yuan to various local branches for relief.

### Prices Secretly Creeping Up: Oil, Rice, and Grains Lead the Surge, Silk Shops and North-South Goods Stores Prosper

[Our Own Report] The emergency economic measures had stabilized prices for over forty days, but in the recent days of this month, prices are secretly creeping up again. The authorities are also gradually paying attention, and alarming terms such as "suppress price increases" and "price limits" have reappeared in the newspapers, causing general citizens to feel fear and unease again.

This time, it is oil, rice, and grains that are leading the "price surge." Late last month, a millet shop near the reporter used a red paper of more than ten feet high to write "Buy five dou of white rice and get one jin of flour for free," and posted it at the gate. When the reporter passed by yesterday, he noticed that the red paper had long been swept away cleanly. The four major companies on Nanjing Road and other silk and cloth shops, North-South goods stores, and various shops have suddenly become prosperous again. Housewives are everywhere inquiring about the prices of daily necessities, asking which store has not increased prices, or has increased them less, and rushing to buy more. In response to the surge in daily necessities, they have reached a conclusion in the experience of the entire ten years and more from the beginning of the War of Resistance to today after the victory, which is "Buy quickly, buy as much as possible, and use up all the money."

Rice: The authorities have set a price limit of 140,000 yuan per dan for rice, but in fact, 140,000 yuan can only buy the lowest quality broken rice per dan. The best quality white japonica rice is only available to familiar old customers, and the price is negotiated on the spot, usually around 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. "High-quality goods" sold at retail also cost 150,000 yuan per dan, and second-class goods cost 146,000 yuan. This is the market situation for the day before yesterday. After the price limit of 250,000 yuan per dan for cooking oil, oil merchants shouted the slogan of insufficient cost. General medical gardens or grocery stores that also sell cooking oil still charge 4,120 yuan per jin of raw oil.

Cigarettes: Cigarettes are also a type that has increased sharply. Morris cigarettes retail for 3,100 yuan per pack. If you smoke one pack every day, you will spend nearly 100,000 yuan per month. Huang Xi Bao cigarettes were sold for 13,000 yuan per tin three days ago, but yesterday they cost 18,000 to 19,000 yuan. 35 Brand, which originally sold for 20,000 yuan, has also risen to 28,000 yuan. Since the black market exchange rate for US dollars has risen from 11,800 yuan to 16,000 to 17,000 yuan, "foreign goods" have also been noticed and purchased. Carnation milk powder, one pound package, costs 21,000 yuan each, and experienced milk powder customers still unanimously believe that "it has not risen enough."

Western Medicine: The price increase of Western medicine is also quite fierce. Yesterday evening at 8 o'clock, the reporter went to a pharmacy next to the Hongmiao Temple to buy tablet penicillin, and inquired that the price of a bottle of 15 tablets was 40,000 yuan. But ten minutes later, when he got the money to buy it, the price was asked for 50,000 yuan. Not only did they not recognize the price agreed upon ten minutes ago, but they also said: "We didn't want to sell it in the first place." This has simply reached the point of hoarding and profiteering.

In the tram, the reporter heard the conversation of three industrial workers. A said: "Yesterday I called a rickshaw from Dapu Bridge to Avenue Joffre, and the rickshaw puller insisted on 3,000 yuan, even 2,500 yuan was not enough. He said that 3,000 yuan is just the price of two sheng of rice." B said: "Yes! After the cost of living index was frozen, wages did not increase, but prices are increasing every day. I really don't understand what the municipal government is doing." C shook his head and said: "I don't know how the Social Affairs Bureau will calculate this month's allowance (i.e., differential allowance). Don't come up with another 73,000 yuan."

### Regulations on Deferred Conscription Scope for Current Police Personnel: Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Receives Instructions

### Strengthening Traffic Control: Police Bureau Establishes Control Room for Zoned Mobile Command

The city's traffic problem has always been valued by the valley side, but due to the narrow roads of congenital conditions, the surge in vehicles after the war (more than 90,000 vehicles before the war, more than 150,000 vehicles at the time of victory, and now increased to more than 240,000 vehicles), the cancellation of the area restrictions in the concession era, the complexity of vehicle types, and the fact that violation fines have no warning effect due to the depreciation of currency values, and other objective factors, the municipal government's painstaking planning is still difficult to achieve improvement results. In order to strengthen the control effect, the Municipal Police Bureau will establish a traffic control room on the 16th of this month, with the director of the administrative office of the bureau concurrently serving as the director of the room. A large team of traffic police will be established under the room, with Zhang Yuanjing as the captain.

### Living in a Boat and Losing Everything: Boatman Stealing a Daughter's Clothes in a Suitcase Accidentally Led to Solving the Case

[Our Own Report] Kunqu actress Wang Baolian and Qipai veteran actor Chen Hefeng performed together along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and were well received. During the lunar first month, when they were performing at the Jiaxing Grand Theater in Jiaxing, because there was also a housing shortage in the area, it was not easy to find a house to live in for a while, so they rented a day boat as a temporary residence, living and eating there. There were seven or eight boxes of theater costumes and casual clothes they brought. Unexpectedly, on January 23, when actress Wang boarded the shore to perform, the boatman Fang Jinsheng (from Ningbo) and his wife Fang Ming started a bad idea and drove the boat away without a trace. Afterwards, actress Wang reported to the local police authority for investigation, and she stopped performing after the expiration of the performance contract and came to Shanghai.

After eating, when she came down from the upstairs, she suddenly saw a female guest on the ground floor who was also eating. The coat she was wearing seemed to be the stolen item.

What is called "breaking iron shoes to find nowhere, it comes all without effort" she twisted her on the spot, and reported to the Lao Zha Police Branch.

(1) Chest Pain

Zhang Guozhen asked: I suffered from pneumonia a month ago, and had severe pain in the upper right chest. The pain doubled when I coughed. I could not lie on my side when I slept.

What medicine is effective? Also, my complexion is not good (presenting a yellowish color). I don't know what kind of vitamins I lack. What medicine can cure it?

### Our Newspaper's Second Weekly Broadcast Yesterday: Li Shizeng Speaks on the Problem of Socialization

[Our Own Report] Our newspaper broadcasted a full-day broadcast program at the Jindu Radio Station yesterday, and invited party and state elder Li Shihui (see picture) to broadcast "The Problem of Socialization." Mr. Li recently married Ms. Lin Sushan, and after their marriage, they went to Hong Kong for their honeymoon. Yesterday, they both came together. The full text of his speech is as follows:

"The problem of socialization can be said to be very simple, and it can also be said to be very complicated. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year and the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee this year have both had proposals on socialization. In addition, various publications and newspapers have also discussed it a lot. Now, I will only give a simple and clear explanation in a short period of time. The so-called socialization, judging from the literal meaning of these three words, can already understand the general idea. However, socialization can be said from various aspects, and can be studied, tested, and implemented from various aspects. On a small scale, the psychology and behavior of an individual or an individual are also related to socialization, which can be said to be the problem of individual socialization. On a larger scale,

family, economy, politics, and culture all have problems of socialization. On an even larger scale, it is the socialization of the world. Therefore, the scope of socialization is extremely large and all-encompassing. Now I will talk about two points: one is political socialization, and the other is economic socialization. Everyone knows that politics and economics are inseparable. Now the political and economic systems of the world are divided into (1) private capital system, which is an economic and political system, which is actually a past system, at least it is a past system in trend. (2)

social system. This system is currently only being tested locally, and many are not truly socialized. For example, the systems of the Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany in the past are not true but false socialization. Their systems can be said to be national socialism. Although they are implementing a social system, they concentrate the highest power in the state. Therefore, there are only private capital systems and national systems in the world today. Neither of these two systems is what we need. Only a truly social system is the most important, the most advanced, and the most moderate system. Society is all-encompassing, including individuals and the country, but society should be the most important, and sociality should be the most important. The social system does not obliterate individual rights, but because individuals cannot be separated from society, individual needs should be limited. Similarly, the country is also part of society and has its necessary responsibilities, one of which is national defense. Of course, after achieving true socialization and true peace in the world,

the national defense problem can be reduced. But today, even the collective security measures of the United Nations are still inseparable from national defense, so heavy industry must be done by the state. Other economic construction must also be concentrated in the state. The meaning of socialization is that at a time when the private capital system has not completely passed and the country still has to take on the task of national defense, at least it can start a social system movement. In Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the Principle of Democracy belongs to the political aspect, and the Principle of People's Livelihood is the problem of socialization. The Principle of People's Livelihood is closely related to socialization. Mr. Sun said that the Principle of People's Livelihood is socialism, but there are various kinds of socialism. What Mr. Sun said is certainly not the Soviet or German style, but a socialized system, a doctrine of the socialized way, so it is a commentary on the social livelihood doctrine."

### Famous Actors Will Sing Pingju and Kunqu Opera

In addition to inviting Li Shizeng to broadcast during the day, our newspaper's second special broadcast held last night also gathered many wonderful programs, and there were also many famous actors singing Pingju and Kunqu Opera in the evening. The Pingju program was "Si Lang Visits His Mother," with Mr. Fan Shiren as Si Lang, Miss Yuan Lingyun as the Princess, Mr. Huang Jingbo as the Empress Dowager, Mr. He Shixi as Yang Zongbao, Mr. Tang Shouqian as Liu Lang, and Mr. Xu Ziyun as She Taijun, all of whom were the best of the time. In addition, there were excerpted Qingchang, including Mr. Zhang Shihuan's "Execution of Zi at Yuanmen" and Miss Zhu Min's "Baolian Lantern," both of which were masterpieces. Kunqu Opera was "Autumn River" from "The Jade Hairpin," sung by Yin Zhenxian and Zhu Yaowen, "Ballad of Eternal Life," "Qiao Vinegar" from "The West Chamber," "Looking Homeward" from "The Shepherd's Tale," and "Visiting Su" from "The Red Pear," which were played by Fan Boyan, Ye Xiaohong, Zhou Yunxuan, Fan Boyan, and Miss Liu Xuanyuan in turn. The wonderful tunes were presented one after another, and the elegant rhymes were about to flow, which was truly a rare concert. It is said that there will be more wonderful dramas sung by famous actors Yang Wannong and Shen Bonian in the next issue.

### Tangshan Engineering College Army Difficulties Expected to be Resolved

[Our Newspaper, Tangshan Air Dispatch] Tangshan Engineering College, which has been impoverished for years, has shown signs of improvement after the joint efforts of teachers and students inside and outside the school. Recently, the college received a letter from the Nanjing Alumni Association, reporting on solutions to the difficulties. The original intention of the letter was to respond to several points suggested by more than 150 students of the college to the Alumni Association. After discussion by the Nanjing Alumni Association, the following four points were listed: (1) Regarding the improvement of professor treatment, after alumni Mao Yisheng, Li Zhongnang, and Zhang Jianming negotiated with the Ministry of Education and the government, the Ministry of Education agreed to include the college in the list of twenty-one colleges and universities to be upgraded to the original standard. Therefore, the treatment of professors at the college can be included in the second level. (2) Regarding the addition of instruments, books, and factory equipment, the Ministry of Education was unable to agree due to financial constraints. In addition to alumni raising funds separately, the Ministry of Communications has agreed to assist with 400 million yuan for expanding equipment. (3) As for the recruitment of more professors, alumni in Beijing and Shanghai have made every effort to find them and are urging the old professors who are still staying in Beijing and Shanghai to return to Tangshan as soon as possible. The letter ended by mentioning the issue of the president's selection. In today's situation of financial constraints and turmoil, hiring someone from outside the school to take on this position may not be as ideal, and President Gu has been in office for many years, with scholarship and morality sufficient to be a role model. Therefore, the association's opinion is unanimously to retain Gu as president.

### Letter to Mr. Shu Xincheng

— Liu Liuying

——Providing Some Humble Opinions on How to Promote Electrified Education

I participated in your second electrified education symposium on the evening of the 6th and heard some of your conversations. Although it was just some, it made me feel a lot, and I felt that there were some words, like a bone stuck in my throat, that I really wanted to pour out. However, I didn't have anyone to talk to because the theme of your conversation was to use movies and slides for the "literacy" movement; and what I wanted to express was another aspect, and it would take a long time to explain, so providing it in writing seemed more appropriate, so I'm narrating it separately here; I hope you will correct me, I would be very grateful.

A. Promoting Educational Films

Utilization of educational films: Since November 19 last year, when the Executive Yuan announced the "Revised Interim Measures for Import Trade," the promotion of electrified education has been greatly hit, and all parties engaged in this work have tasted all kinds of hardships. After a lot of effort, appealing to the authorities and various parties, although the entire set of tools for electrified education has not yet achieved the goal of smooth import, educational films were finally approved by the Supreme Economic Commission on December 2 of the same year to be excluded from import quotas and allowed to be imported duty-free. Since our financial resources are very limited, and our material resources are hindered by the inability to import smoothly, and the import of these educational films has been obtained through great hardship, then we should adapt to this situation and make full use of foreign educational films.

Reviewing Educational Films: I know that there are already more than 100 kinds of films in the Encyclopedia Britannica textbook that have been imported, but there are still several families producing textbook films and slides from the UK and the US. I believe that a small review committee should be organized to select certain categories that should be imported. With this reviewed catalog, importers, agents, and other electrified education institutions can have a standard to follow when purchasing, so as to avoid wasting financial resources.

Translation of Textbook Films "Teaching Materials": The translation of the Encyclopedia Britannica textbook film teaching materials is being handled by China Bookstore, which has transferred it to China Film Photographic Equipment Supply Company, which is already in contact with the US side. If this can be realized, it will be of great help to the screening of the Encyclopedia Britannica textbook films. With this kind of translated version, there will be a feeling of "two beauties together, two difficulties combined." For audiences with a lower level of English, the film can be screened silently; at the same time, the teacher explains it based on the translated version; this is truly the most ideal thing. This method is simpler and more economical than changing the recording of the film to Mandarin. Of course, recording sound or translating teaching materials for other educational films is also worth considering.

Cinemas Should Show More Educational Films: In order to increase the public's knowledge, this point should be achieved. It is a recognized fact that students enter cinemas. In this kind of place, making them increase their knowledge is also entertainment without forgetting to study. Moreover, there are also dropouts who enter cinemas, which can also make them receive some forced education. These words may seem like a joke and are too unserious, but they are indeed all true.

Efforts Should Be Made to Make the Education Authorities Recognize Educational Films: This is also very important, but it has been neglected. If education authorities, such as principals, head teachers, etc., do not understand or know what educational films are, then they will not try to screen educational films, and the students under their leadership will not have the opportunity to appreciate this treasure trove of knowledge.

B. Film and Broadcasting Should Work Together

Electrified education is by no means a one-sided matter for film. Broadcasting also occupies a very important position. China's broadcasting industry has a long history and considerable equipment. However, it seems that it has not made a sufficiently satisfactory contribution to the promotion of electrified education. The following things seem to be necessary and urgently need to be realized.

Expanding the Electrified Education Symposium: We have held two symposiums, and most of the participants are people from the film industry, so the discussion is also biased towards this aspect. If we want to promote electrified education in two ways, the next symposium, or future symposiums, should invite the broadcasting industry to participate and discuss it together.

Broadcasting Stations Should Be Made More Academic: To achieve this goal, it is best for several newspapers, publishers, schools, and other cultural institutions to jointly assume this responsibility. Since March 17 this year, Shen Bao has created news broadcasts three times a day, which is a new record in China's news industry. Recent radio stations also have academic lectures. But this direction of aerial cultural broadcasting seems to be still too little. How to expand it further and achieve an ideal close to "academic" is very worthy of discussion.

Broadcasting and Literacy Movement: Using broadcasting to carry out the literacy movement seems to be labor-saving and has a great effect. If newspapers or magazines are willing to engage in this movement, then pre-publishing some broadcast texts at any time may achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy with half the effort and twice the result.

C. Fundamentally Removing Obstacles to Promoting Electrified Education

The "Revised Interim Measures for Import Trade" is the biggest obstacle to promoting electrified education. I have elaborated on this in detail in the Film and Broadcasting Monthly (combined issue of Volume 5, Numbers 8 and 9) jointly organized by the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education and Jinling University. In short, all tools related to promoting electrified education, except for books, are on the list of prohibited imports according to these interim measures. (The opening up of the import of educational films is a recent event. However, the foreign exchange applied for for this type of goods is still unable to be approved.——This is very puzzling.)

If these interim measures are not amended immediately, electrified education and the "literacy" movement cannot proceed smoothly. This is a fundamental obstacle. We must break through this difficult barrier. We should work in this direction.

What method we should use to achieve this goal is worthy of joint discussion.

### Changchun Uses Electrified Education to Expand Literacy Movement

### Hansong Team Achieves Victory, Defeating the Soviet Union Three to One

The Korean Hansong football team traveled to Shanghai for an exhibition match. Yesterday, they made their first appearance against the Soviet team. The Korean team had a successful start, defeating the Soviet Union by a score of three to one. In the first half, the visiting team took the lead with two goals to one. Yesterday afternoon, the Yiguo Stadium was packed with an unusually large crowd, estimated at over 15,000 people, all eager to watch. The Korean Overseas Chinese Support Association specially organized a cheering squad to attend, creating an unprecedented spectacle. Before the game, the Hansong team, led by Li Yongshan and Shen Guoquan, entered the field and stood in front of the grandstand. The Korean cheering squad sang the national anthem and set off firecrackers to encourage the team, and the audience responded with enthusiastic applause.

Garden Team Scores First

When the appointed time arrived, Soviet team captain Robert Stoff presented flowers, which were accepted by visiting team captain Park Gyujeong. Referee Zhang Le, and linesmen Deng Xiaoliang and Li Guoyi, took the field to officiate, and a fierce battle began. Hansong kicked off first, with Zheng Nanzhi moving the ball forward to attack. Tie Fu and Niejielin worked together to defend. After a chaotic four minutes, Hansong's Yu Jinghuan launched an offensive from the wing, and Zheng Nanzhi got the ball, taking an initial shot that went slightly wide. The Soviets launched a counterattack, with Tie Fu passing long to the left corner. Nogokov broke through one-on-one, and the visiting team's defense failed to stop him, resulting in a one-to-zero lead for the Soviet Union. Unhappy with conceding the first goal, the visiting team, led by Kim Yongshik, launched an attack. Yu Jinghuan cut and shot from the right corner, and Zhu You got the rebound. Kim Yongshik took another forceful shot, which Chihahlov caught without incident.

Visiting Team Takes a One-Goal Lead

At the fourteenth minute, the blonde Robert Stoff dribbled into the penalty area. At a critical moment, Park Daejong slid to clear the ball. Three minutes later, Niejielin committed a handball in the penalty area, and Kim Yongshik took the penalty kick, but missed the opportunity due to eagerness to win. The Soviets counterattacked, with Kapustin receiving a pass from Shawaning and taking a powerful shot from 30 yards out, which Che Chunchong jumped to save. Soon after, the visiting team's forwards used short passes to approach the Soviet goal, and shot powerfully from eight yards out, finding the back of the net, tying the game at one to one. With the score level, the visiting team's central defenders and forwards became more active. In the 32nd minute, Zheng Nanzhi broke through in the middle, going on a solo run. Chihahlov was caught by surprise, and the ball went in, putting the visiting team ahead by two to one. Subsequently, the visiting team's momentum increased, but before long, the first half ended, with the visiting Hansong team leading by two to one.

Visiting Team Launches Fierce Attack in Second Half

After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed play. The Soviet Union kept its original lineup, while the visiting team replaced Wu Jinghuan, who was injured in the eye, with An Zhongxiu. After the restart, the Soviets tried hard to recover, launching a major offensive. However, the visiting team played with increasing courage, with its three central defenders effectively passing the ball back and forth. The Soviet forwards found it difficult to cross the line, and Robert Stoff was tightly marked by Kim Gyuhwan, rendering him ineffective. After eight minutes, the visiting team's forwards became rampant again, with Kim Yongshik and Yu Jinghuan taking repeated shots, which Chihahlov managed to save with difficulty. At this time, the Soviet territory was almost entirely controlled by Hansong, before a prolonged siege was relieved.

Soviet Union Suffers Defeat, Three to One

In the 23rd minute, visiting team member Min Bing committed a handball in the penalty area. Zhang Le awarded a penalty kick, which Tie Fu took, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. Less than three minutes later, Sarman followed suit, and Yu Jinghuan scored a goal in return, making it three to one to the visiting team. The Soviet Union, having lost key positions in quick succession, launched a counterattack, but Robert Stoff was unable to turn the tide single-handedly. Hansong waited for the offensive to pass, then attacked again, putting the Soviet defense under intense pressure. This continued until the end of the match, and fortunately for the Soviets, no further goals were conceded. When the allotted time expired, the whistle blew, and the visiting team defeated the Soviet Union by a score of three to one, achieving a successful start to their tour.

Less than four minutes later, Chen Zunchang scored again, making it two to zero. In the second half, Datia University launched a desperate counterattack, and in the 20th minute, they were awarded a penalty kick, which they missed.

### Junior Cup Football Final: Railway Team Wins Championship; Lu Qingxiang's Goal Defeats Qingbai

The Junior Cup football final was held yesterday morning at 9:30 AM at Yiyuan Stadium between the Railway team and Qingbai B. No tickets were sold, and the stadium was crowded with fans. The result was that the Railway team, with all its forces committed, defeated Qingbai B by a score of one to zero, winning the championship. The match played out as follows:

At 9:30, the whistle blew to start the game. Qingbai B launched the first attack, with Jing Linggui leading the charge into Railway territory. Fortunately, Wu Jiabang, Yue Renxiao, Xu Shengyuan, and others defended effectively, preventing any mishaps. The Railway team, after a period of defense, launched their own attack, with Xiao Ziwen and Wu Binghao advancing together, but with little effect. After a period of chaotic play, the first half ended, with the score at zero to zero.

After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed play. The Railway team launched an all-out counterattack, putting Qingbai B's defense under intense pressure. Zhang Fenggang, Xu Guofu, defended on the left and right, while Huang Shijie supported from front and back, keeping busy. After a chaotic 28 minutes, Lu Qingxiang received a pass from Lin Dianyi and shot powerfully from close range. Huang Shijie was unable to save it, and the ball went into the net, putting the Railway team ahead by one to zero. Qingbai B tried to counterattack, but the Railway team's defense was tight, leaving no openings.

### Wuxi Spring Sports Meet to Be Held in Late April

### Special Feature on Female Athletes: Female Champion Liu Zhenbao

Among the famous athletes on the Green Team's women's basketball team, which is well-known in Jiangnan, besides Ms. Huang Mingyuan, is Ms. Liu Zhenbao. Ms. Liu is a sharpshooter on the women's basketball team, with almost every shot finding the net. She and Huang Mingyuan can be considered unparalleled, competing with each other, and she is always the highest scorer in every game. Her teammates on the Green Team call her "Female Champion." Very few people inside or outside the circle know this nickname, but "Female Champion" certainly has its origin, dating back eight years.

Events of Eight Years Ago

It was April 2, 1939, when the Youth Association Sports Department organized a men's and women's shooting competition. There were eight heroines participating on the women's side. As a result, Ms. Liu ranked first with 67 points. Therefore, the name Female Champion arose, and her achievement was not obtained in a single day. Below are the results of the top four in the competition at that time:

Name Basket Shot Free Throw Long Shot Dribbling Total Score

Liu Zhenbao 22 24 6 15 67

Li Yunzhi 21 14 15 13 63

Wang Weizhen 18 20 3 18 59

Wang Yinlan 26 14 3 11 54

After reading the above story from the basketball arena, we understood the origin of "Female Champion." Ms. Liu, in this session with the Green Team, switched from defense to forward. In every game, she always gets the most points, originally - her shooting skills were already amazing eight years ago. In addition to Liu Zhenbao, Li Chuozhi, Wang Weizhen, and Wang Yinlan are all Green Team generals. With so many talents, it's no wonder that the Green Team dominates Shanghai.

Has Two Styles

She has the look of a southern girl, and you wouldn't know that she is originally from Guangdong. However, some say she has the gentleness of a southerner. She grew up in the South. In other words, she is a girl with two styles. You see, she has a slightly longer face and round, bright eyes, which is indeed a symbol of a southern girl. As for her personality, it can be said to be completely "quiet" and "gentle." Ordinary people think that athletes should be dynamic and strong, but she is the opposite. Who would have thought that such a gentle and quiet lady would be a general on the basketball court!

Life and Recreation

Of course - everyone knows that she is a top student of Qixiu. She became famous in basketball by representing the Qixiu team. After graduating from Qixiu, she went to Shanghai University. She graduated two years ago, and now she is an English teacher at her alma mater (Qixiu Middle School). In addition to teaching, her after-class recreation is practicing with several teammates from the Green Team and participating in competitions. In addition, she likes to watch movies, and she is also very interested in photography. Ms. Liu's life and recreation can be said to be very proper.

Promoting Successors

The Green Team has a new recruit, Ms. Renbao. Her face and attitude are very similar to Ms. Liu. Everyone originally thought she was her sister. Only after appearing in this session did they know she wasn't. Ms. Xu is very interested in basketball. So, she follows her to watch and practice basketball for three years. Ms. Liu always patiently instructs and teaches her. Ms. Xu is now a member of the Green Team. I think that under the training of the female champion, her future achievements are expected.

Good News is Coming Soon

The author has inquired about her wedding several times, but she always answers "too early." It is reported that Ms. Liu has found a satisfactory partner, and the wedding is not far away. Most female basketball players retire and stay at home after getting married. Of course, the Green Team will suffer a serious loss. At the same time, fans will not be able to see the "Female Champion's" shooting skills. However - she is promoting Ms. Xu, and the next generation will rise. This is exactly her painstaking effort!

### Four Banks Joint Office Stipulates That Various Banks and Bureaus Assist in the Purchase and Supply of Goods

Previously, in order to suppress prices, the authorities ordered the financial sector to assist in handling. The Four Banks Joint Office immediately stipulated that various banks and bureaus should release educational business to cooperate with the method of supplying daily necessities for people's livelihoods, assist in promoting the plan, and use the existing branches of various banks and bureaus to assist in purchasing and supplying goods, so as to help facilitate transportation and dredge the source of goods. This method has been approved by the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Office. The method is recorded below: (1) When the supplying agency orders products from various producing areas and various production enterprises, it may contact the automobile and transportation banks and bureaus to provide priority loans in the form of export financing. (2) When the supplying agency needs funds to turn over for the self-ordered and allocated goods, it may contact the professional banks and bureaus to provide priority loans in the form of export financing. (3) When each bank and bureau handles this export financing, it should try to facilitate it as much as possible and pay attention to the following points: (A) The export financing period should be determined based on the length of the transportation route. (B) The export financing discount should be appropriately relaxed. (C) Various freight vouchers and required documents should be simplified as much as possible to avoid complexity. (D) Within the possible scope, handle cargo insurance and other necessary procedures on behalf of the client. (4) Public and private transportation enterprises that borrow from various banks should earnestly cooperate and assist in the purchase, sale, and transportation of supplied goods, and handle it in accordance with the following points: (A) Allocate a certain amount of transportation capacity to transport supplied goods. (B) Transport supplied goods at the lowest possible freight rate. (C) Transport supplied goods on the earliest possible date.

### Industry and Commerce Guidance Office Discusses Import Quota for Paper

[Reported by This Newspaper] Recently, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has repeatedly convened various paper mills to discuss the supply of papermaking raw materials in this city. Regarding the issue of allocating import quotas for paper, the member factories of the paper industry stated that the foreign exchange quota for February to April for paper is $3,460,000. Among them, cigarette paper is 800,000 US dollars, newspaper is 2 million US dollars, wood pulp is 350,000 US dollars, and miscellaneous items are 300,000 US dollars. It is said that this distribution method is based on the statistics of the Republic of China years 25-26 and last year. However, the situation of the domestic paper industry ten years ago is completely different from today. Moreover, due to the dumping of foreign goods last year (about 100,000 tons of imported paper), most factories stopped work. In addition, the sale of enemy and puppet pulp resulted in a very small amount of pulp imports. It is not very reasonable to use this as a basis. After consultation between the parties, the following methods are considered to have value for consideration:

(1) The next import quota should be relaxed for foreign exchange settlement for paper.

(2) If the foreign exchange settlement quota cannot be relaxed, the following items can be adopted as appropriate:

(B) The inventory of cigarette paper in this city can be used for several months, and the import volume can be temporarily reduced. Because Minfeng Paper Mill can now produce 30,000 rolls per year, which is only one-quarter of the consumption. Production can be doubled in July. After that, the import of cigarette paper can be limited to 2,000 tons per year.

(A) The import of newspaper can be changed to wood pulp. Because one ton of wood pulp can make two tons of newspaper. Therefore, with the same amount of foreign exchange, two times the amount of newspaper can be manufactured in the country, which is beneficial to the cultural industry and can save foreign exchange. Two million US dollars can order about 10,000 tons of pulp. About 3,000 tons can be obtained per month. The raw materials of various paper mills will be supplemented to some extent. And the work of the various paper mills will not fall into a state of stagnation.

(C) Most of the miscellaneous paper can be manufactured by itself, and should be strictly restricted to be used for pulp imports.

In addition, blankets and copper wire mesh, which are necessary for papermaking, must also rely on imported goods. Although blankets are manufactured in this country, their durability is only one-third of that of foreign goods. Copper wire mesh must be imported by any means.

### China Cooperative Determines Grades of Branches

The Central Cooperative Treasury has seven branches and nine sub-branches distributed throughout the country. Recently, in order to facilitate management, the treasury has temporarily determined three grades for the branches. The first-grade branches include the four branches in Shanghai, Northeast, Hebei, and Hubei. There are no second-grade branches for the time being. The third-grade branches include the three branches in Henan, Beiping, and Shandong. There is only one first-grade sub-branch, the Qingdao sub-branch. There are no second-grade sub-branches for the time being. The third-grade sub-branches include the eight sub-branches in Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Bengbu, Taixian, Jinzhou, Liaoyang, Andong, and Fancheng. In addition, the treasury plans to set up a third-grade sub-branch in Wuxi and Wuhu. It can be established in the short term. In the larger local areas of Yangzhou, Dongtai, Tunxi, etc., a branch office will be set up in each province to promote cooperative undertakings in various places.

### Conflict Between Seafood, Dried Longan, and Northern Goods Industries and Southern Goods Industry

The seafood, northern goods, and dried longan industries in this city suddenly refused to allow the southern goods industry to purchase goods from the 12th of this month, and sent inspectors to refuse the southern goods industry to contact transactions on the second and third floors of the Xiaodongmen market and inspect freight cars. This caused a great disturbance. The Shanghai City Sugar, Seafood, Northern Goods, Southern Sundries Industry Joint Market on Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi, was originally a gathering place for the Shanghai sugar, seafood, northern goods, southern goods, and other industries to buy and sell goods. Because the southern goods industry purchased goods from the previous three industries, it usually paid ten-day checks called Suoqi (ie, intermediary fees), which were also decided by the four industries to implement for a long time. Now, the previous three industries suddenly decided to notify the southern goods industry that all transactions would be settled in cash. However, the southern goods industry believes that using cash will not only exploit profits, but also have a great impact on established prices. It is reported that the southern goods industry has decided to stop business after selling out the inventory in each store, and asked the competent authorities for relief.

### Japanese Expansion of Production Endangers Our Textile Industry

[Nanjing, 13th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Our textile industry is facing a new crisis, and the economic authorities are planning to provide relief. According to an economic authority who told reporters, the Japanese textile industry currently has 3 million spindles, which is several times more than our current 1.4 million spindles. Recently, Japan has also loudly called the textile industry its lifeline, and the Allied Headquarters also intends to increase its number of spindles from 3 million to 6 million. If this is realized, it will be a major blow to our fragile textile industry. The story of Japanese cotton monopolizing the East Asian market after the First World War is bound to repeat itself. The authorities are paying close attention to this and have recently held meetings to discuss possible negotiations with the Allied Headquarters to find ways to prevent it. Another possible step is to increase the import tax rate on textiles. Encouraging the production of domestic cotton has been given great attention in the past, and will be given even more importance in the future.

### Rising Prices of Paper Fans

The paper fans used in summer are mostly produced in Guangdong. This year, due to rare production and strong sales, prices have soared. According to a Cantonese businessman, the price of paper fans this year has increased significantly compared to last year. This is because the production area of Xinhui only produced one-third of last year's output, while sales are more prosperous than in recent years. At the same time, it was also learned that before the victory, the enemy and puppets had prohibited people from planting sunflowers. If they want to restore the pre-war output, it will take at least five years.

### Increased Demand and Rising Prices for Tobacco Leaves

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the prices of Qingzhou, Xuzhou, Fengyang, Tongcheng, Xinchang, Sidu, Tongxiang, Susong, and other tobacco leaves in the city have already increased. According to people in the industry, tobacco leaves are better sold to tobacco factories, and the demand is stronger. In addition, water fees, transportation fees, and tax payments are frequently increasing, and the upward trend is just beginning.

Increased Cost of Xiangxu Tobacco Leaves

[Another Dispatch] Recently, the price of Xuzhou tobacco leaves has been increasing step by step. The reason is said to be that the local price in Xuchang has increased, so Shanghai has also increased accordingly. According to people who are familiar with the content and have research experience, Xiangxu tobacco leaves originally had a lot of adulteration. Recently, the local county government's goods tax bureau, tobacco industry association, and tobacco production improvement office and other agencies have jointly cracked down on it. The tobacco industry is taking the procurement of goods seriously, so the tobacco leaves in that place are pure and no longer adulterated, and they can be stored for a long time without damage. Even after the yellow and moldy season, they will not deteriorate. However, because the selection is strict and the cost is increased, the price should be increased accordingly. However, the Xuye tobacco in Shanghai is all transported before the adjustment, and there are adulterated goods in it, and it contains a lot of moisture. In the summer, there is a danger of mold and discoloration, so manufacturers are wary and dare not import too much. Although the asking price is very high, there are very few transactions.

### Alumni of East Asia Physical Education School Welcome Chairman Li

### Special Features on Female Athletes: Woman's Champion Liu Zhenbao

In the Green Team women's basketball team, which is famous in Jiangnan, the famous players are, in addition to Miss Huang Mingyuan, Miss Liu Zhenbao. Miss Liu is a basketball player in the women's basketball team who is a shooter, and she must hit the shot, and she and Huang Mingyuan can be called two difficult, competing with each other, and she is always the highest scorer in each game. Among the Green Team, the companions call her "The Female Champion," this nickname is known to very few people inside and outside the circle, but the road to "The Female Champion" does have its origins.

Name Basket Free Throw Long Throw Transport Throw Total Points

Liu Zhenbao 22 24 6 15 67

Li Yunzhi 21 14 15 13 63

Wang Weizhen 18 20 3 18 59

Wang Yinlan 26 14 3 11 54

After reading the above section of the basketball game, we understood the origin of "The Female Champion." This term, Ms. Liu, in the Green Team, changed from defender to forward. She always gets the most points in every game. Originally - her shooting skills had already been amazing eight years ago. In addition to Liu Zhenbao, Li Chuozhi, Wang Weizhen, and Wang Yinlan are all great generals of the Green Team, and there are so many talents that it is no wonder that the Green Team is dominant in Shanghai, and no one can surpass it.

There are Two Kinds of Grace

How much is she taking on a girl's posture in the South Country, if you don't say it, you won't know that she is originally from Guangdong, but some people say that she has the gentleness of a southerner, she was raised in the South since she was a child, in other words, she is a girl with two kinds of grace. Look, she has a slightly long face and round and vivid black eyes, which is indeed a symbol of a southern girl. As for her personality, it can be said to be completely "quiet" and "gentle." Ordinary people think that athletes should be moving, just, but she is just the opposite. Who would have thought that such a gentle and quiet lady would be a female general who gallops on the court!

Life and Recreation

Of course - everyone knows that she is a talented student of Qixiu, because she became famous in basketball by representing the Qixiu team in Shanghai that year, and after graduating from Qixiu, she entered Shanghai University, so two years ago, she wore a square hat, and now she is in her alma mater (Qixiu Middle School) and is an English teacher. In addition to teaching, her after-class recreation is practicing with several teammates from the Green Team and participating in competitions. In addition, she likes to watch movies, and she is also very interested in photography. Ms. Liu's life and recreation can be said to be very upright.

On the promotion of later generations

There is a new Jin Renbao Miss on the Green Team, her face and attitude are very similar to her, and everyone originally thought she was her sister. Only after her appearance in this session did she know that she was not. Miss Xu is very determined to play basketball, so she has been following her to watch the game and practice the ball for three years as a day. Miss Liu has also always patiently instructed her and taught her. Miss Xu is now a member of the Green Team. I think that under the training of the female champion, the achievements of the alien day are expected.

Happy Events are Coming Soon

I have asked her about her happy events several times, but she always answers "too early." It is reported that Miss Liu has found a satisfactory object, and the joy is not far away. Most female basketball players retire and live at home after getting married. Of course, the Green Team will suffer serious losses. At the same time, fans will not be able to see the "Female Champion" 's shooting skills, but - she is promoting Miss Xu, and later generations have someone, which is exactly her hard work! (Aicui)

### Domestically Produced Knitwear: Slightly Better Sales in Southeast Asia

[Report from our newspaper] A leading figure in the city's knitwear industry told our reporter yesterday that the export situation for domestically produced knitwear has become more active since the foreign exchange rate adjustment, with Southeast Asia being the main destination. According to estimates, the monthly export volume to Southeast Asia in the past two months has been approximately 100,000 dozens of socks and 60,000 dozens of underwear. There is still a slight profit to be made from shipments to Hong Kong and the Philippines. Shipments to Singapore, Siam, and other places yield no profit at all. Currently, merchants are exploring shipments, hoping to restore the pre-war market for domestically produced knitwear in Southeast Asia. According to statistics, the current export volume to Southeast Asia is less than 20% of the peak season before the war. It is urgently hoped that relevant departments will provide practical assistance and promotion to the export of this industry. As for the previous joint effort by the industry with several cotton yarn re-weaving trade associations to form a joint venture company for the export of cotton yarn re-woven products, it is still in the planning stage. It is said that the purpose of the company is nothing more than to use the collective strength of the industry to exchange finished products for cotton yarn and cotton thread from state-owned yarn factories, which is a manufacturing agency. The finished products are then exported by the company in a planned manner. However, due to the importance of this matter and the wide range of involvement, it is still actively soliciting opinions from all parties concerned. Once the time is right, it will be planned to establish it.

### Nylon Tires

[Reuters, New York, 11th] Goodyear Rubber Tire Company has recently manufactured a tire made entirely of nylon thread. It is said that the strength of this tire is 60% greater than any other tire. In addition, the tire casing is made of six-ply nylon, making the tire lighter and stronger. However, due to the current shortage of nylon, the company is temporarily only manufacturing pure nylon tires for large vehicles.

### China Silk Company Convenes Symposium

Research on Loan and Cocoon Purchasing Issues

[Report from our newspaper] The annual silk production and sales plan drafted by the China Silk Company has not yet been approved after being submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and then to the Executive Yuan for review. However, the cocoon collection time in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is approaching, with only 45 days remaining in Jiangsu and only one month in Zhejiang. In order to gain time and prepare in advance, the company specially convened a symposium yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, bringing together representatives from the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Those attending included Ge Jingzhong and Tang Xixiang from the China Silk Company, Zhou Yuangong representing the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Jiang Shiqi representing the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Chu Fucheng, Leng Yuqiu, Wang Huanan, and Shen Jiuru from the Third District Silk Trade Association, Tao Juru from the China Farmers Bank, and others. The discussion ended around 12:00 noon. It was decided to form another small group meeting, which will be held continuously for ten days starting next week, to jointly study preparatory work such as spring silkworm loans, cocoon collection, and opening cocoon houses, in order to promote this year's production and sales plan.

### Machine Casting and Other Industries Negotiate Purchase of North China Steel

[Report from our newspaper] The Bureau of Industry and Commerce previously negotiated on behalf of the city's machine, casting, and electrical equipment industries for the purchase of iron and steel from North China. It has now been confirmed that the Shanghai Operations Office of the Iron and Steel Enterprise Management Committee of the Executive Yuan will handle the matter. It is now known that the required quantities for each industry and the dates of shipment have been determined. The three industries need a total of 2,643 tons of No. 1 pig iron and 277 tons of No. 2 pig iron, totaling 2,920 tons. The delivery dates are as follows: the first batch of 1,000 tons will be shipped from Qinhuangdao before April 15th; the second batch of 1,000 tons will be shipped from the same location before April 30th; and the third batch of 920 tons will be shipped from the same location before May 15th. The price is only 1.23 million yuan per ton.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Investigates Price Fluctuations

[Report from our Suzhou correspondent] In view of the recent price fluctuations, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to establish a provincial economic reporting office to strengthen control. It has urgently telegraphed the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, ordering them to report the price increases and decreases of daily necessities such as rice, oil, flour, firewood, and yarn every Wednesday and Saturday. Any drastic changes must be reported immediately for instructions.

### Review of the Spring Woolen Fabric Market: Prices Have Been Rising Steadily for Three Months

In mid-January of the 35th year of the Republic, the woolen fabric market was mediocre, and transactions were even more sluggish. Except for fancy woolen fabrics, which were trending stronger and prospects looked good, there were no other ups and downs. The price of overcoat fabrics fell particularly sharply because the peak selling season had passed. The 27th was the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, and the market opened on a positive note, with an average increase of 1.5%. In general, merchants were aware of the government's strict control over imports, the difficulty of obtaining foreign exchange, and the constant increase in factory prices. With the issuance of the 250 and 500 gold bond notes and widespread rumors of foreign exchange adjustments, the prices of daily necessities soared one after another. Although new woolen fabric transactions were less than in previous years, the outlook was quite promising.

Overall, woolen fabric businesses in the 35th year of the Republic made the most profit, followed by those in Qipan Street, while those in Zihua Street, except for Xie Da, made a considerable profit, and the rest were lucky to avoid losses. The profits from wholesale were only on paper, as most of the profits were consumed by high-interest loans. On the 28th, Chun He Yong was robbed of fancy woolen fabrics, with an estimated loss of 12 million yuan, which also reflects the situation at the time.

In early March, the prices of all woolen fabrics increased across the board. With rumors of favorable buying opportunities prevalent, factories hoarded goods to drive up prices. On the 5th, after the 50% increase in tariffs, the market became even more expensive. At the same time, gold and US dollars were rising, and prices were rising across the board, so woolen fabrics were no exception. On the 17th, the US exchange rate was adjusted from 3,350 to 12,000 yuan, which had a significant direct impact on woolen fabrics. As a result, retail and wholesale prices increased further. Although the government stipulated that 4.8 million gold yuan be collected by the national bank and made every effort to stabilize prices, prices on the market were still rising overtly and covertly. On the 22nd, after the temporary ban on the import of woolen fabrics was announced, panic arose again in the industry. Most import merchants were forced to halt their business. All manufacturers of woolen fabrics took the opportunity to rise, like the darlings of heaven, and prices soared. Woolen fabric stores followed the lead of the manufacturers, and retail prices rose step by step due to the difficulty of importing goods and the hoarding of goods to drive up prices.

Looking back at the actual sales at that time, there was little activity from local and foreign customers due to the cold weather. Except for Melton, there were few large transactions. In addition, due to the fear of high-interest loans, people dared not try again. Moreover, prices were rising too fast, and the colors were incomplete, which increased costs and made it difficult to turn over inventory. Among buyers, under the high pressure of the current cost of living, there were only a few who could afford to have a suit made for tens of thousands of yuan or a robe for four or five hundred thousand yuan. Therefore, the current trend in the woolen fabric industry is nothing more than a shortage of goods, high prices, and difficult buying and selling.

In the middle of last month, following the momentum of the previous month, prices continued to rise from beginning to end. Due to the fact that raincoats were in season and the increase in finishing fees and yarn prices, the price per yard increased from 12,000-13,000 yuan to 17,000-18,000 yuan. Summer goods were priced surprisingly high, with English-made valeting being quoted at 235,000 yuan per yard, domestic fabrics at 150,000-160,000 yuan, and Zhanghua palings selling for 140,000 yuan. However, actual transactions were few, because local and foreign buyers not only thought the prices were too high, but also because the actual sales season was still some time away. However, the prices of fancy woolen fabrics and Xuanwei fabrics have increased significantly. Light-colored woolen fabrics were in short supply and selling well, with strong demand from local stores and Nanjing stores. For the same quality of goods, the selling price often differed by 3,000-5,000 yuan per yard due to the difference in color. The standard prices for spring woolen fabrics from January 15 to March 15 are listed below:

(Commodity) (January 15) (February 15) (March 15)

(Yuan) (Yuan) (Yuan)

Hong Sheng Fancy Cloth 5,100

### The Mystery of Chen Yi's Death: Dynamics of the Shandong Communists After the Central Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Was Cleared

— Dispatch from Jinan, 5th Day of the Month via Airmail. Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Fu Tian

Despite the Chinese Communists' repeated claims that the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the area west of it were voluntarily abandoned as a strategic move by the Communist forces, the fact remains that the Xuzhou-Jinan section was cleared, and the two Nationalist armies led by Wang Yaowu and Wang Jingjiu joined forces. With the clearing of the Xuzhou-Jinan section, the entire situation in Shandong has entered a new stage. The next target of the Nationalist army is naturally to annihilate the main force of the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountain area, along with the necessary action of reopening the Jiaoji Railway (at least the Jinan-Zhangdian Zibo section).

Deployment and Intentions of the Shandong Communists

As military strategists say, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." It is worth noting that since the Luzhong Campaign in late February, Chen Yi has been running an officer training camp in Zichuan, calling up Communist division commanders and platoon leaders in stages for ten days of training per period. Over the past month or so, all cadres have completed the training. At the same time, the losses suffered in the battles of Lunan, Luzhong, and Luxi have been replenished. As of now, the dynamics of the Shandong Communists can be explained in three aspects:

(1) Outer Perimeter of Jinan: Including the area west of Zhangdian, north of Mengyin Dawenkou, south of Yucheng, and west of the Jinpu Railway. It is estimated that a total of fourteen Communist divisions and three brigades, totaling approximately 200,000 men, are stationed there (local troops and militia are not included). Their deployment is as follows: The New First Division is stationed east of Zhangdian; the Second and Fourth Divisions are stationed between Zhangdian and Zhoucun; the 7th column is stationed between Mingshui and Guodian; the 11th column is stationed in Zhangqiu; the 6th Division is stationed in Zichuan; the 3rd column is stationed in Laiwu; the 4th and 9th Divisions and the 1st guard brigade are stationed in the Fanjiazhen area east of Taian; the 8th division is stationed near Xintai; the 2nd guard brigade is stationed in and north of Mount Tai; part of the 1st division is stationed in Mount Culai, and part is stationed north of Feixian; the 7th division, the New 7th division and New 11th division are stationed in Mengyin. North of the Yellow River, in addition to local teams, only the 6th Guard Brigade is currently stationed near Yucheng. The main force of Liu Bocheng's troops, originally stationed between Qihe, Xishou, and Zhangjian, secretly moved west to northern Henan on March 23, launching an offensive against the Daoqing Railway in an attempt to traverse northern Henan and enter southern Shanxi to join forces with the troops of Peng Dehuai and He Long, who had retreated from northern Shaanxi to western Shanxi, to attack Shanxi. After repeated setbacks in attacking Jipu, the Communist forces in the above-mentioned areas changed their strategy, concentrating their main forces in the Laiwu, Xintai, Fanjiazhen, and Yangliudian areas. Their possible actions include:

1. Advancing and retreating between Mount Tai and Mount Culai, cutting off traffic on the Xuzhou-Jinan section and severing the connection between the Nationalist army's north and south corps.

2. Launching another attack on southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, attacking the rear of the Nationalist army.

3. Maintaining maneuverability, attacking the flank of the Nationalist army advancing north from Linyi.

(2) Changwei Area: The Communist forces on the outskirts of Changle, Weixian, and Anqiu have also suffered repeated setbacks, and now only the 5th Guard Brigade and militia remain, which are not a major concern. According to reports obtained on the 2nd and 4th of this month, their main force of approximately 30,000 has been transferred to the southeast of Yishui, apparently intending to attack the flank of Linyi and then launch another attack on northern Jiangsu.

(3) Outer Perimeter of Qingdao: In addition to the original 5th and 6th columns, the 3rd and 4th guard brigades, and the Binhai Independent 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments, the Binbei Independent 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments, the Jiaonan Column, and the militia, more than 20,000 men have recently been transferred from Yantai. At the same time, the highway from Yantai to Jimo north to Lingshan has been repaired, and the coastal highway from Yantai east to Weihaiwei and west to Changyi has also been repaired and extended to Yangjiaogou at the mouth of the Xiaoqing River. Their intentions are to prevent the Nationalist army's navy from landing to facilitate the deployment of troops and to create a threatening posture towards Qingdao. However, the Nationalist army's troop strength on the island is not weak, but passive defense is still more than sufficient.

Reorganization of the Battle Order

Following the "Chinese Communist Revolutionary Military Commission" renaming the Eighth Route Army as the "Chinese People's Liberation Army," the New Fourth Army and other forces in Shandong originally under the command of Chen Yi were also renamed the "East China People's Liberation Army" or "East China Field Army" from March, with Chen Yi still serving as commander and Su Yu and Zhang Dingcheng serving as deputy commanders. Zhang Aiping, the former commander of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army, was transferred to the position of chief of staff. In addition to the original political commissar Rao Jishi continuing to serve, Tan Zhenlin, the commander of the Sixth Division of the New Fourth Army, was also transferred to serve as political commissar. Deng Ziming and Zhong Qiguang were appointed as the directors of the political department. The original designations of the various divisions of the New Fourth Army and the various liberation divisions, new divisions, guard brigades, etc., were all abolished and replaced by ten columns, with each column comprising three divisions, each division comprising three regiments, and one special service regiment, one training regiment, and one artillery regiment. Each column had approximately 30,000 to 35,000 men. The total strength, excluding the militia, is currently approximately 350,000 men due to the westward transfer of Liu Bocheng's main force (losses from various battles have been fully replenished).

The Abandonment Theory is Just a Smokescreen

On the morning of the 15th of last (March), a Nationalist army unit discovered two jeeps, one sedan, and two medium-sized Japanese trucks near Shangzhuang, south of Zhoucun Railway Station. These vehicles were traveling from east to west, apparently carrying the leaders of the Shandong Communists. An ambush attack was launched. Afterwards, news came that Chen Yi was in the car. A bullet entered from Chen's shoulder and exited from his flank, and he died of his injuries on the 17th, or the 19th, according to another account. The headquarters of the East China Field Army in Dakandi, Zichuan, and the pseudo-provincial government in Shantouzhuang, Boshan, both held grand memorial services. However, the confession of a prisoner captured by the Baoding Pacification Office stated that he had seen the Jian Guo Daily published in northern Shaanxi with the number 1853, which contained an article by Zhu De mourning Chen Yi. What is doubtful is that the prisoner was able to remember the publication number of the newspaper when he read it. Recently, someone who escaped from Luzhong to Jinan said that Chen Yi had recently attended a certain fruit meeting and given a speech. Therefore, some observers believe that this is a deliberate attempt by the Communist army to spread misinformation and pass off the false as true. This is similar to the Communist army's recent deliberate fabrication of slogans such as "Abandoning the interior and recovering the exterior," and "Abandoning Shandong, but not abandoning the youth of Shandong" in order to weaken the morale of the Nationalist army. This deserves the high vigilance of the Nationalist army. Evidence of this is that although the Shandong Communists have transported much of the materials they plundered in Luzhong to the Bohai Military Region north of the Yellow River, their troops are not only not being transferred north, but are being transferred south and concentrated in the Xintai, Mengyin, and Yishui areas, repairing the coastal highways, the highway between Yantai and Jimo, and the highway between Yidu and Yishui to facilitate their supply and movement. It can be seen that their intentions are not small, and there is no sign of abandoning Shandong. The so-called abandonment is really just a smokescreen, because strategically, only by ensuring Shandong can the Communist army launch another attack on southern Shandong and return to northern Jiangsu at any time.

The Last Days of the Southern China Despot

### Take a Look at the Fate of the Number One War Criminal in Southern China: Tanaka Hisaichi Executed

— Guangzhou Dispatch, April 2. Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Liang Feng

March 27 was the most gratifying day for the people of Guangzhou, especially for the people of Guangzhou during the occupation. Their hatred, which had been suppressed in their hearts for many years, disappeared today! Because Tanaka Hisaichi, a lieutenant general of the army and commander of the Southern China Expeditionary Army and Governor of Hong Kong, who had dominated Southern China for more than two years, was publicly executed on the afternoon of that day!

At about 3:20, Cai Lijin, the military prosecutor of the military court of the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters, accompanied by clerk and translator Zeng Guangke, took the stand and brought Tanaka up. At that time, Tanaka was wearing a very neat military uniform, wearing a military cap, wearing nearsighted glasses, and holding a yellow leather bag with a zipper in his hand. The yellow leather shoes on his feet were polished brightly. As soon as he entered the court door, he took off his military cap and bowed to the judge. After the judge read out the charges against him, he asked him if he had any last words. He only requested that his belongings be sent back to his family in Japan. Other than that, he had nothing else to say. On the surface, he knew that the death penalty was about to be carried out, but he was still very calm. Although his pale face revealed some melancholy emotions, he still could not see the trembling of his knees. Probably, he also knew that his sins were full and that he would eventually have this day!

After verifying his identity, translator Zeng Guangke found him some Japanese utensils and gave him a glass of Japanese wine and a Japanese cigarette. This was his last enjoyment.

After all the formalities were completed, the 26th Regiment of the Gendarmerie took over the task and escorted him onto a large truck to parade through the streets under the white cloth banner that read "Execution of Japanese War Criminal Tanaka Hisaichi, Commander-in-Chief of Southern China." Wherever the truck passed, thousands of people flocked to see the face of this monster. The people along the way all celebrated with their hands raised. They whispered about the tragic past when our compatriots were poisoned by him during the occupation, grinding their teeth as if this deep hatred had not yet been extinguished!

The place of execution was the Liuhua Bridge execution ground in the suburbs of the city. Under the escort of two gendarmes, Tanaka walked more than ten steps facing west. At this time, he was no longer allowed to be calm. Probably, at the moment between life and death, it is inevitable that there will be some fear. At that time, he clenched his teeth tightly, fully revealing his original ferocious face. At 4:16, the supervising officer gave an order, and Tanaka Hisaichi knelt down on both knees. The shooter aimed his rifle at Tanaka's back heart and fired with a bang. Tanaka fell forward, and the shooter fired three more shots. Only his yellow velvet military uniform was stained red with blood. This war-mongering generation of heroes ended here. This is the end of those who play with weapons!

A Humble Proposal for Improving Fire Protection in the Southern City

Editor: In this fire in the Southern City, most of the victims were poor shantytown residents, because the building materials were all easily flammable materials, and they were densely built in one area, so once a fire broke out, it was uncontrollable. Moreover, the Taiping dragon heads in the Southern City are mostly damaged, so even if there are fire trucks, they are useless. After this big fire, we could have learned from the past and prevented future occurrences, and found ways to improve, but instead, the shantytowns are still being built in the same place. Therefore, formal residents are all in constant danger, fearing that once a fire breaks out, they will repeat the same mistakes. We sincerely hope that the authorities will take preemptive measures and persuade the shantytowns to move to the suburbs, such as the area near the South Railway Station, where there is vacant land. On the one hand, we should add water pipes and improve fire-fighting equipment. This matter concerns public safety and the appearance of the city. Please publish it in your newspaper to urge the municipal authorities to adopt it. (A resident of the Southern City)

Please Suppress the Soaring Price of Cotton as Soon as Possible

Editor: Last month, prices soared unprecedentedly. Fortunately, the government implemented emergency economic measures to suppress the prices of various goods. However, it was not long before the price of cotton soared. According to the price of rough cotton at the beginning of February (per dan), it was only 180,000 yuan, but during the gold tide period, it once reached 440,000 yuan. Later, due to the implementation of the economic emergency measures plan, it was suppressed to 350,000 yuan. However, in the blink of an eye, it has reappeared at a new peak of 530,000 yuan. Cotton is an agricultural product, and a high price can indeed increase farmers' income, but since the price of cotton is high, the cost of yarn and cloth has increased sharply, and yarn and cloth are essential daily necessities, so the impact on people's livelihood goes without saying. Moreover, compared with other major commodities - such as rice - it has obviously lost its balance (the price of white rice at the beginning of February was 80,000 yuan, and now it is only 110,000 yuan). If this abnormal state is allowed to continue without finding a way to eliminate it, it will inevitably affect other prices in the future and should be stopped as soon as possible. (Jiang Xiaoluan, Tangjia Gate) March 5.

Public Training Survivors Call for Relief

I previously saw in various newspapers that the supplies issued by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration first went to Shanghai. I recall that the most pitiful are the survivors of the Shanghai citizens who received public training and died in the Anti-Japanese War. They have not yet received benefits. The martyrs sacrificed for national survival and territorial integrity. They received public training and were organized into the guards to participate in the August 13 Incident, the Battle of Songhu, and fought side by side with the local garrison. Some were responsible for spying on enemy information, maintaining transportation, detecting enemy spies, rescuing air raid refugees and wounded soldiers, and building defensive works. Later, when the Japanese invaders landed in Jinshanwei, they covered the Nationalist army's westward retreat, and then retreated from Shanghai with the army. They were ordered to be sent to Qingpu Songjiang and then given special training and reorganized into the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Special Operations Detachment to serve as the foundation for the Anti-Japanese War. Later, they were attacked by the enemy with the latest weapons, and most of the public training members made heroic sacrifices. Their achievements can be imagined. Although they were not praised by the National Government authorities, they became a brilliant and glorious page in Chinese history. Today, a group of orphans and widows are left behind, suffering from hunger and cold. Now that the country has been victorious for more than a year, we are still suffering from this unspeakable life. I hope that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the social authorities will quickly investigate and provide relief to this group of anti-Japanese survivors as much as possible to comfort the loyal souls and announce to the future. (Zhou Hanze, representative of the survivors of public training team martyrs)

The Old West Gate Should be Rectified in Two Matters

Editor:

The inscription on the Chen Xianlie Memorial Tower at the Old West Gate, carved in marble, describes the revolutionary achievements of Mr. Chen Xianlie. But now, the marble is covered with stains, and the gold characters cannot be identified. Furthermore, there is a neon light frame made by the former Mayor Wu Tiecheng to the east of the tower, with ten large characters "Implement New Life and Eliminate Bad Habits." According to newspapers, outdoor neon lights in stores will be restored starting on April 1. Then, these ten characters should be seen in the light again, complementing the four characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" on the 24th floor of the International Hotel. The above two matters are all related to the appearance of the city and the transformation of customs. Please pay attention to them, municipal authorities. (Tao Dejun)

### Review of Japan's Reparations Problem

— Zhao Nanrou

Reparations from defeated nations to victorious nations have been a common practice since the dawn of warfare, especially when an aggressor nation is defeated and must pay reparations to the nation it invaded – this is even more reasonable and natural. However, regarding the principle of reparations, there's a distinction between punitive reparations and damage reparations, and the latter is further divided into full reparations and incomplete reparations. As for the methods of reparations, there's a distinction between monetary reparations and reparations in kind. Concerning reparations from Japan after its defeat, the principles and methods adopted by the United Nations can first be found in the Potsdam Declaration. The Declaration stated: "Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war." Based on this spirit, the United States, in its initial post-surrender policy toward Japan published in September 1945, stated: "All facilities for manufacturing and processing goods and materials exceeding peaceful domestic requirements and which are not necessary to the maintenance of Japan’s peaceful economy, shall be removed." It further stated: "No reparations shall be exacted which conflict with the program for the demilitarization of Japan or which are liable to hinder its execution." Based on the same spirit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang stated in London in September 1945: "China hopes to first confiscate Japanese factories in Japan and Northeast China, and obtain reparations from them." Subsequently, while staying in Paris in September of the following year, he also stated: "Although China suffered great losses during the war, it will not make reparations demands exceeding Japan's ability to pay. China will not adopt a policy of revenge when drafting the peace treaty." It is clear that neither the Potsdam Declaration, nor the policies of the United States or China, adopted punitive principles, but rather adopted an incomplete reparations principle. This is because adopting a punitive principle exceeding Japan's ability to pay would only lead to resentment from the Japanese people, and adopting full damage reparations would also be beyond Japan's ability to pay. At the same time, the method of reparations in kind was adopted instead of monetary reparations. This is because monetary reparations lack certainty, as evidenced by Germany's reparations after World War I. Furthermore, monetary reparations cannot restrict the industrial production of the nation paying reparations, which could still lead to rearmament. Conversely, reparations in kind not only have certainty but can also restrict rearmament based on industrial strength. Although the fundamental policies of China and the United States regarding Japan's reparations problem were both based on the Potsdam Declaration, the focus of the two countries in dealing with this problem was not entirely the same. The United States focused on eliminating Japan's industrial base for rearmament and did not emphasize Japan's reparations for its damages to the U.S. President Truman's reparations commissioner, Pauley, stated in Tokyo: "Our purpose is to demilitarize Japan and create a democratic Japan. If this purpose of occupation can be achieved, it does not matter even if we do not get reparations." This is because the reparations that Japan could give to the United States were insignificant in the eyes of the United States. As Pauley said in Los Angeles in December 1945: "The United States' war expenses against Japan amounted to 100 billion U.S. dollars, but Japan's reparations to the United States would probably not exceed 1 billion U.S. dollars, which is just 'a drop in the bucket.'" Of course, the United States insisted on "removing all facilities for manufacturing and processing goods and materials exceeding peaceful domestic requirements," as reparations, but it placed more emphasis on reparations for the countries of the Far East rather than for itself. Pauley said in his speech in Los Angeles: "Japanese industrial facilities, machinery, and equipment will soon be shipped to China and the Philippines because the rapid development of industries in Far Eastern countries other than Japan is the best guarantee against Japan launching another war of aggression." Therefore, its main purpose was to eliminate Japan's industrial base for aggression. However, China, on the one hand, attached importance to the above point, and on the other hand, equally valued Japan's reparations for its own damages to China, because China needed Japan to compensate for machinery to rebuild and develop industry in the ruins of war. Therefore, even if it was "a drop in the bucket" in the eyes of the United States, it was a valuable sweet dew to China.

However, whether from the perspective of eliminating Japan's industrial base for rearmament or from the perspective of rebuilding and developing its own industry, there would be no objection from the eleven countries entitled to reparations in making Japan implement reparations quickly. However, this matter is related to determining the industrial equipment that Japan should retain, and it is impossible to know what level of industrial equipment is necessary for Japan's peaceful economy before the peace treaty is signed. The signing of the peace treaty requires investigation and preparation beforehand, and even after the conference is convened, the opinions of the various countries may not be immediately consistent, so it cannot be achieved immediately. On the other hand, countries suffering from war damage are eagerly awaiting Japan's reparations. Therefore, the so-called interim reparations plan was created. The so-called interim means that before determining the peaceful industries that Japan should retain, a temporary designation is made for industrial facilities that should be used as reparations, and within the designated scope, a portion can be dismantled and shipped first. After investigating Japan's remaining industry, the Pauley Mission published the so-called interim reparations plan. Based on this plan, the Far Eastern Commission passed a resolution in May 1946, notifying MacArthur to designate factories in the twelve departments of ordnance, shipbuilding, aviation, machine tools, steel, bearings, thermal power generation, sulfuric acid, salt production, synthetic petroleum, synthetic rubber, and light metals for reparations. As a result, MacArthur designated approximately one thousand factories, with approximately ten million tons of machinery. On April 3, the United States instructed MacArthur to quickly distribute the factories, which were part of the interim reparations materials. This part of the factories accounts for approximately 30% of the total amount designated by MacArthur, with China receiving 15%, and the Philippines, Burma, the Federation of Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies each receiving 5%.

There are several different views on the motives behind this U.S. move. One is that because Pauley argued that the factory equipment that the Soviet Union transported from Northeast China, valued at 2 billion U.S. dollars (some say it was only worth 900 million U.S. dollars), should be included in the scope of Japan's total reparations materials and not recognized as the Soviet Union's "spoils of war," the Soviet Union held the opposite view. Therefore, it always opposed participating in the Japan reparations conference that the United States had been advocating since August 1946. The U.S.'s move was a "showdown" with the Soviet Union, with anti-Soviet effect. Another is that the U.S. recognized that several countries most severely affected by the war were in urgent need of reconstruction, so it first distributed this part of the materials. Still another is that the U.S. believed that if the reparations materials were not dismantled early, Japanese capitalists would not know which factories would be retained, and would be unwilling to actively produce, which would inevitably aggravate Japan's current economic crisis, so it took the current measure. From China's position, China urgently needs reconstruction, and at the same time, it hopes that the Japanese people can escape from the "production idleness" of the capitalists and overcome the current economic difficulties. Therefore, it should agree with this measure to quickly distribute Japanese reparations. Even if the U.S.'s motive is based on the first view, it is naturally not what China wants, because what China hopes for is international coordination, especially the coordination between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Therefore, China has always advocated that the attitude towards Japan's reparations problem should be resolved by unanimous agreement of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission. However, because the materials distributed this time are interim reparations, and are only a part of the interim reparations, when the peace conference with Japan is convened in the future, how the industrial equipment that Japan should retain should be stipulated, in what proportion should each country be distributed, and how the industrial equipment transported to the Northeast by the Soviet Union should be handled, there is still ample room for review and opportunities for resolution. Therefore, regardless of the U.S.'s motives, from China's own perspective, from Japan, and even from the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, we can and should agree with this distribution.

Now, the reparations materials that China will obtain amount to approximately 1.3 million tons. Although the dismantling, packaging, and transportation to Japanese ports are stipulated to be the responsibility of the Japanese government, the cost of transporting them to China and reassembling them is estimated by the Reparations Committee of the Executive Yuan to be 800 billion legal tender. Even if this estimate is not too low and the funds can be raised, and at the same time it does not affect the deficit finance, it is still not possible to solve the difficulties of the problem by relying on money alone. The difficulties of the problem are: first, in the ships. China's existing ships are all less than 300,000 tons, which is not enough to maintain domestic shipping, let alone to undertake the task of transporting this batch of reparations materials within a short period of time. In this way, we can only borrow U.S. ships, but it is said that MacArthur has previously expressed his unwillingness to send U.S. ships for transportation, so it is not necessarily optimistic whether this can be done. Secondly, even if they are transported, how to load and unload them? Are there warehouses to store them? Again, the dismantling is done by others, but the assembly must be done by ourselves. Is there no problem with this? Even if they are assembled, are there enough technicians to operate them? These problems are not simple. If the Chinese authorities do not plan in advance and seek solutions early, no one can guarantee that the bad situation of receiving enemy property in the country in the early days of victory will not be repeated. At the same time, in view of the fact that Japan, the defeated nation, has already planned for the Tao problem, and the Reparations Implementation Law has been formulated, and the details such as 12 million tons of nails and 6 million tons of steel skin required for transportation packaging have been calculated early, while China has not seen any specific decisions, so people cannot help but worry.

Precisely because of these difficult problems, two opinions have recently emerged in the country: one is to sell all or part of the interim reparations materials that China is entitled to to Japan or other countries; the other is to keep the materials in Japan, with China obtaining sovereignty, and entrust Japan to continue to operate them. Neither of these is a good way, especially the latter is not acceptable. This matter is contradictory to both eliminating Japan's industrial base for rearmament and China's industrial recovery, and at a time when the international situation is unpredictable, the so-called "sovereignty" is a dangerous thing with many long nights and dreams. Japan's conservative forces are very welcome to this matter. On February 20, the Speaker of the House of Peers, Shimazu Ginzō, publicly stated in the Diet: "I hope that the Allied countries will not dismantle Japan's reparations materials, but will allow Japan to continue to operate them under the supervision of a supervisory agency organized by the United Nations." This is an exposure of the mindset of Japanese financial cliques and capitalists. Whether we consider it from the perspective of China's recovery, international peace, or even the interests of the majority of the Japanese people, we should not do this kind of thing that is sought after by Japanese conservative forces. Secondly, the industrially advanced countries such as the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France will not want this batch of relatively old machines. Even if the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies need them, they have also received allocations this time. At the same time, instead of buying old ones, it is better to buy newer machines from foreign countries, so they probably will not want them either. If they are sold to Japan, it will not only give it a part of the industrial base for rearmament, but also violate the Potsdam Declaration's main purpose of emphasizing reparations in kind, turning it into monetary reparations. However, if it is absolutely necessary, adopting this method is still better than obtaining the empty name of "sovereignty." The reason is that, on the one hand, although the Potsdam Declaration emphasizes reparations in kind, it does not explicitly oppose the provisions of monetary reparations; on the other hand, if sold at a price, it can be free from restrictions on time and type, and used to purchase better machines from foreign countries. The Japanese have said: "Our machines are already old and obsolete. After the reparations materials are dismantled and transported, we can purchase new machines from the United States." Why can't China do this? The question is, how can the certainty of such a disguised form of monetary reparations be guaranteed? And is China determined to use this reparation to revive or even develop industry, like Japan's utilization method after obtaining Chinese reparations in the Sino-Japanese War? Even so, it is still inevitable that it will affect the industrial standard required to maintain Japan's peaceful economy, so the most reasonable way, of course, is for China to transport it back by itself, so that it can avoid all the disadvantages of the above two methods. Time is pressing, so let's see how the authorities will work hard.

Spring and Autumn

### The Function of Cultural Exchange

— Wu Lucin

The establishment of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is a remarkable and progressive arrangement for the future of international relations. This progress stems partly from past painful experiences and partly from human awareness. Under the current international situation caused by different political ideologies and concepts, treaties and agreements are merely a restraint on the disruption of peace and cannot be regarded as a guarantee of lasting peace. The function of restraint is negative and temporary. This situation is similar to disputes between people that are temporarily settled through the mediation of a third party. The reason for ceasing hostilities may be due to consideration for the mediator's feelings, fear of unfavorable objective circumstances, or other reasons. However, this cessation, even to the point of shaking hands and making peace, cannot guarantee that a minor incident will not cause a falling out in the future. International relations are similar. To hope that we will no longer suffer from the scourge of war, we should focus on the positive aspects of guaranteeing peace, and contractual restraints alone are not enough. Half a century of painful experience has shown us that treaties and agreements can be turned into waste paper at any time.

What do I mean by focusing on the positive or active aspects? In the past, our country's designs for international relations emphasized prevention too much while neglecting foundation building. Even more pitiful is that in the designs for prevention, foresight was lacking, and the mindset was narrow. As a result, prevention became a source of trouble. Can we not admit that politicians of strong nations sowed the seeds for the Second World War as early as Versailles? At the UNESCO meeting in Paris last year, a participating delegate said, "Wars originate in the minds of men." If we want to eliminate wars, we should first start by eliminating the knots in people's minds. The factors that create these knots include racial prejudice, traditional hatred, suspicion, misunderstanding, etc. The current international situation, with its faint signs of being in the same boat in calm seas but becoming enemies again, can be said to be the lingering poison of one of these factors not being eliminated and the expansion of another factor. In the sacred task of rebuilding the world tomorrow, these ailments must be eliminated one by one, which is unquestionable. Common sense and past experience tell us that we cannot rely on treaties and agreements to cure these ailments. The restraint of treaties, even if effective for a time, cannot be expected to last forever. The reason is simple: how can social interactions between people reach the realm of righteous friendships through mere polite phrases and lavish banquets? The brotherhood proclaimed during a boisterous banquet is merely to liven up the scene and cannot cultivate genuine friendship. The improvement of relations between countries cannot be achieved through cocktail parties, nor can it be effective to sign a few treaties after a fierce battle. At this time, talking about the ideal of a unified world may feel necessary in the abstract, but we are not psychologically prepared enough, because preparations in this area are far from adequate.

Indeed, the advancement of science has brought countries closer together, to the point where they are like neighbors next door. However, the shortening of distance merely increases convenience. If this convenience is not used to put some effort into cultural exchange, then understanding and recognition between countries can still be very limited and superficial. Human experience tells us that there are many neighbors who live to old age without ever communicating with each other. Even if they interact, it is limited to congratulating on happy occasions and offering condolences on sad occasions, which is merely superficial. They are still far from the highest realm of friendship, "righteous friendship." How can the relations between countries be any different? Some of the current international turmoil should be attributed to the narrow-mindedness of certain ethnic groups. The expansion of this narrow-mindedness actively seeks to infiltrate other ethnic groups with its own political ideology and lifestyle, and passively causes suspicion, doubt, and fear of countries with different political ideologies and lifestyles. The result of cultural exchange can gradually create genuine understanding and recognition between each other, which is to build the foundation of genuine friendship.

Here, a question arises, namely the prejudice that British novelist Rudyard Kipling spoke of, "East is East, and West is West." In the general perception, it is almost believed that cultural exchange and cooperation between different ethnic groups is impossible. We acknowledge that this work is not easy, but we do not admit that it is impossible. One thing must be clarified, and that is that the culture of an ethnic group has its characteristics, and there is a commonality in culture among ethnic groups. Culture is the external manifestation of a way of life that an ethnic group has created over many years. Although the superficial lives of one ethnic group and another may differ greatly and have many distinctions, if we analyze their internal factors, we believe that cultural exchange is possible and must be useful. Because no matter how different the beliefs, sentiments, languages, or daily lives of one ethnic group and another may be, a common factor is still indispensable, and that is "human nature." And any culture is a creation of "human nature."

We only affirm that cultural exchange between countries is possible and must be useful. However, reaping the fruits of this usefulness is not something that can be achieved overnight. It requires time, patience, and, more importantly, open-mindedness. Each ethnic group must sincerely hope to seek recognition and understanding through cultural exchange and further influence each other. International relations must be based on mutual recognition and mutual understanding before we can talk about mutual respect and deference. And different political ideologies and different lifestyles can only be balanced under the circumstance of mutual influence. The effectiveness of cultural exchange may not be immediately apparent, but if humanity can continue to work hard in this area for a long time, its value will be immortal. In essence, this work is a prerequisite for the ideal of a unified world.

### Unfinished Work

— Hengwei

Mrs. Liszt was my piano teacher, and as far as I know, she was a countess in the era of Imperial Russia. Since Lenin raised the banner of revolution, she began a life of wandering; her footprints traversed Europe, and finally, she detoured through Southeast Asia, stepping into our ancient country; because she loved the twilight of Kunming Lake, she decided to settle down.

"She must have been a beauty in the past," I thought when I first saw her. Because at her age, maintaining such a slender figure was truly rare and commendable. She spoke beautiful English and, unlike other old ladies, didn't like to chatter incessantly. From her elegant speech, graceful demeanor, and melancholy eyes, anyone could discern how captivating her past years must have been.

Her home was near Kunming Lake, a small, exquisitely decorated three-room cottage. But what caught the most attention was the oil painting hanging on the mantelpiece. It was painted so delicately, so vividly; although it was just an unfinished work.

It was a beautiful twilight, the lake surface shimmering with the golden light of the setting sun. After I finished playing the last movement, as usual, Mrs. Liszt would hand me a cup of coffee and say:

"Child, take a rest. Really, you have made progress."

"Thank you, Madam." I was very satisfied with my teacher's praise, even though she often encouraged me like that. After sipping a mouthful of coffee, I began to pay attention to the painting again.

"It's so beautiful!" I said.

"I say this painting is truly beautiful, Madam. But I have a question?"

"A question?"

"Yes, Madam. Look at the girl in the painting, how beautiful she is, with her green dress, soft golden hair, and a bouquet of yellow roses leaning against her chest; everything, everything seems so harmonious, so beautiful. But Madam, why is this still an unfinished work? Here, there is still a scorch mark?"

"Yes, child. This is an unfinished work. But, it will never be completed." She sighed sadly.

"Madam, do you mean that no one can finish it?"

"Yes, child. The person who painted this picture has already passed away."

"What a pity."

I couldn't help but sigh. But suddenly I saw that Mrs. Liszt's eyes were filled with tears.

"Madam, I'm sorry, did my words cause you sadness? You are crying?"

"Child, sit down, I want to tell you this story. A story about this portrait, I hope it can bring you some enlightenment."

Facing the sunset, in the glittering tears, she began to narrate that sad and tragic past.

It should be traced back to many years ago, when Countess Nona still occupied an important position in Moscow's social circles. Because of her youth and beauty, glorious family background, wealthy property, and noble title, she didn't understand what worries were, what sadness was. Although she was pursued by countless young men, she always said proudly:

"Let everyone love me, but I will never love anyone."

But one day, her pride and reserve were subjected to the most unprecedented insult and contempt in her life. It was when a rash young man walked past her, accidentally stepped on her train, and casually apologized to her, saying, "Miss, I stepped on your skirt?" in such an insouciant tone.

So, Nona was furious. She had never suffered such contempt. But this rash young man did not seem to value her beauty and nobility.

When Nona, in anger and injustice, learned that this rash young man's name was Peter Bukharaski, an eccentric painter, she decided to conquer this stubborn young man.

So one afternoon, this attempt with a strong romantic atmosphere began. Nona washed off the makeup on her face, changed into a student dress; carrying a set of books, she went to knock on the young painter's door; after that, she became his student.

Time quietly slipped away in the sunrise and sunset. Although Nona stepped into that dilapidated door every day, she brought her unique charm, beauty, and mysterious passion to that ridiculously stubborn teacher every day. So this young and stubborn painter began with surprise, and then fell head over heels.

But the proud Nona, when she gained spiritual satisfaction, suddenly remembered her past reserve. So it seemed like a voice was telling her:

"Let everyone love me, but I will never love anyone."

Therefore, she abandoned Peter Bukharaski without any nostalgia or hesitation.

For Peter Bukharaski, this was naturally nothing less than a fatal blow. His emotions were aroused by Nona; but when he madly loved her, she abandoned him again.

From then on, Peter used memories and tears to grope for and pursue his past happiness and sweetness. He used his unique and peculiar brush to sketch Nona's beautiful face on paper in color, to sketch his painful memories, and his lost joy.

Finally, the portrait was almost completed; only waiting for the final few strokes. But, the mysterious and unpredictable god of fate came to play with his experiences again. It was a harsh winter night, when Peter was concentrating on revising his work, painfully chewing on his memories, he was suddenly awakened from his painful memories by screams and firelight. When he opened his eyes, the black smoke pouring in from the window and door almost suffocated him. So without any consideration, he instinctively picked up the unfinished work and rushed out the door. But as soon as he left the door, a burning beam collapsed and hit his head, and he so miserably, tightly holding his beloved unfinished work, bid farewell to the world forever.

After Mrs. Liszt finished describing her story in moving words, she lowered her head and made the sign of the cross.

So, the room was filled with suffocating silence.

I looked out the window, the night seemed to have become hazy. So I bid her farewell, saying:

"Good night, Madam. I will always remember this touching story. Thank you for your teaching and that cup of good coffee."

"Good night, child."

I didn't dare to look back at that unfinished work as I left. I hurriedly fled from Mrs. Liszt's sorrow.

Now it's been ten years, and I haven't seen Mrs. Liszt again. But I can't forget this touching story. Ten years is not long, but where have this sad story and its heroine drifted to?

### On Poetry

— Bolo

Poetry is entirely a kind of thing where sincere emotions fill the heart and must be vented. Therefore, people say that poetry is the release of emotions, the cry of the soul. Only poets can express truth and beauty, and only in poetry can we see truth and beauty.

### Centennial Commemoration of Jacobsen

— Zhao Jingshen

Danish writer J. P. Jacobsen was born in 1847 and died in 1885. He only lived to be thirty-eight years old. This year is the centennial of his birth. I have already translated a section from Topsoe Jensen's "Scandinavian Literature" and given it to "Literary Tide Monthly," and now I am translating Magnus's "Dictionary of European Literature," just to add a little embellishment.

"Jacobsen, Jons Peter Jacobsen, 1847-1885, Danish novelist; worked as a botanist and translated Darwin's works into Danish. In 1876, he wrote "Mistress Marie Grubbe." This book is quite difficult to read, but it was painstakingly created. In 1852, he published "Mogens and other short stories." In 1880, he published "Niels Lyhne," which was translated into English as "Siren Voices," (Note: The sirens are found in Greek mythology and Homer's epics. She is one of the three beautiful goddesses on an island near the Italian coast, and legend has it that she uses her singing to lure passing sailors to their demise. When Odysseus passed by, he was afraid that many of the soldiers under him would be bewitched by her.) Saintsbury (the author of the famous three-volume literary criticism history), after the glorious Danish critic Brandes, praised Jacobsen as indeed forward-thinking; his personal view is that the author has the talent of Turgenev and Flaubert. Boyesen's opinion in "Scandinavian Literature" is not as enthusiastic. He feels that Jacobsen

"embellishes mediocrity with study," making the reader "feel compassionate weariness."

Recently, Li Changzhi published a book called "Northern European Literature" at the Commercial Press, with a section on Jacobsen on pages 61-64. Additional references include: Zheng Zhenduo's "Literary Outline," Volume 4, pages 427-8; Mao Dun's "Perspectives on Modern Literature," pages 16-9; Macy's "Stories of World Literature," pages 650-1; Li Juhsiu's "Outline of World Literary History," page 254; Jin Shisheng's "Outline of European Literary History," page 213. Jacobsen's rare works do not seem to have been translated in China yet.

### Remaining Words from the Shuang Yu Xuan Collection

— Hong Weifa

One

Although it's said the flowers came early this year, I didn't seek spring, already lamenting the scarcity of fragrant blossoms; the past events of Jiangnan still fill me with sorrow, the reunions always make other people's homes seem better. She is still as graceful as she was then, suddenly we meet, but alas, she vanishes like a startled swan; from now on, the rivers and mountains will shame my dreams, hearing of it, I still lament my own downfall.

Two

Again, weak catkins drift to the ends of the earth, grass grows and orioles fly, remembering every road in Jiangnan; hundreds of sheets of paper filled with thousands of words, letters sink like fish, geese vanish, who knows where they are. I remember lingering for a short stay when the flowers bloomed, never expecting that spring would bring such leisure to the courtyard; every night, my soul searches for old companions, already knowing that the dream fur coat has no basis.

Three

Last night, the wind and rain were sudden and heavy, tear stains on my pillow, writing out all my longing; outside the building, I stand idly, still glimpsing the place where we parted. Waiting for spring to come and spring to pass, spring goes and spring comes, the mood is always the same; the swallows chirping in pairs should be laughing, how could youthful years be so filled with sorrow.

Four

Last night's stars and night rain, for the sake of affection, for the sake of deep promise, the stream should know the pain of separation, going to the long pavilion morning after morning. The red is sparse and the green gathers at the edge of my eyes, spring has already departed, yet I still sing the Golden Thread song; I double my earnest words, that at the ends of the earth, I can only cherish you forever.

Five

Outside the curtain, the small peach blossoms bloom and fall again, not resenting spring's departure, but remembering our promise of the past; it should be that the world pities my loneliness, water flows and flowers wither, it is not something to be taken lightly. No heavy brocade curtain is hung on the branches, the rain and wind, is the light still as it was yesterday? My love for you is deep, my nature is weak, let the willow catkins drift together.

Six

Crickets chirping on all four walls urge on the dark rain, autumn is already deep, there is no leisure mood; sorrow and joy all go with the flowing water, still, I hear the Golden Thread song for no reason. I remember living in the city with green willows, picking emeralds and searching for fragrances, not knowing the pain of separation; there must be old places where hairpins were left behind, over the years, it has all been mistaken by longing.

### Landscape

Marquet (1875-) is a favorite student of Moreau and is now a basic member of the Salon. His style is vigorous and refined, on par with Vanton and others, and he is an active member of the core writers in the modern Parisian art scene. This work is not large and was purchased by Mr. Oharu. (Lion)

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 316

— Ye Jingfeng

At this time, it was about twelve thirty in the afternoon, the sun was scorching, and it was extremely hot. Zheng Yan made a phone call and came out, seeing that Tsurumi was not in the car, but was standing under the shade of the Broadway Hotel gate across the street, looking out towards the Bund. Zheng Yan quickly drove across the street and told Tsurumi that a room had been reserved at the International Hotel, coincidentally number 915 again; friends had also been invited, and they could meet there between four and five o'clock, without fail. He also said that he had called the "Public Works Department" car office in the name of the Japanese military to inquire about the "10915" license plate number. According to the car office, it was the license plate number of the Japanese Ambassador Okamoto's car, but the car body was not black, but dark blue, a 1936 Dodge, eight-cylinder streamlined sedan.

"Your knowledge has really improved, ha..." Tsurumi laughed.

"Yes, thank you for the captain's praise. Now that we don't need to go to the International Hotel, and it's lunchtime, the subordinate would like to invite the captain to taste Chinese Southern-style imperial cuisine..."

"That fits my ideal... but we have to deal with that public garden case nearby first. The driver said that the Bund Park is over there... Have the car wait here, we'll go over quietly and take a look. I see you've brought your gear, have you loaded your bullets?...”

This Bund Park is not much bigger than the palm of a hand, and it's also a long, narrow strip along the river, how can it be considered a park? But because Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is worth its weight in gold, being able to set aside this open space in this land worth five or six hundred thousand gold pieces per mu (referring to the estimated price more than a decade ago), and even adding things like a music pavilion, goldfish pond, lawn, and flower bed, it would be unfair to such high land prices to say it's not a park.

But during the day, there are no big trees in the park, and in the scorching summer, besides the Western restaurant seats and two or three small pavilions, there is simply no place to cool off, so it can only be said to be a night garden.

(This park is small, but in Shanghai, everyone knows it. The biggest thing is that outside the park gate, there used to be a sign that read "Chinese and dogs not allowed!" This sign, although it was about Chinese people and dogs, dogs have no writing and don't understand that, but it was written in both Chinese and English. English is a common language in Shanghai; and the "Chinese and dogs..." words are extremely simple, so even all kinds of foreigners, such as Russians, French, Germans, Italians, Austrians, Spanish, Portuguese, etc., at least the people and children, all understand the meaning of the sign; at a minimum, they can understand that "Chinese" and "dogs" are placed on an equal footing.

Generally, Chinese people with blood in their veins are certainly resentful of this insulting sign, but because there were guns and cannons supporting it behind the sign, they didn't dare to publicly destroy it. However, some people asked strangely: "Wasn't this Chinese translated by Chinese people? Wasn't it written with a stroke of the Chinese brush? Wasn't it carved by Chinese people? When these translators, writers, and carvers received this order from the foreigners, why didn't they spill their blood five steps away and fight to the death? That translator, who was able to translate these words, and the writer who could write them in one stroke, should at least have shown some spirit!"

But another group of people explained it this way: After the Central Government's Northern Expedition succeeded, foreigners became a little paranoid, thinking that the Chinese had achieved a positive result, and voluntarily tore down that sign insulting the Chinese, not only tearing down the sign, but also opening up the park gate, allowing "people" to enter and exit freely. This group of people personally saw some "people" taking the attitude of "reclaiming" lost land, rushing in, picking the flowers, breaking off the branches, and scooping up the goldfish; one person occupying a four or five-foot-long seat, lying on their back and sleeping soundly; the rest spitting and urinating everywhere; scraping tree bark and signing their names; "XXX was here" was written all over the rocks and walls in various "literary" works. This group of people all said that the "people"'s behavior was too brave! So the next day, the "Chinese and dogs" sign was hung high again at the park entrance.)

The above passage happened in this Bund Park.

### Jin Shengtan's Astronomical Views

— Bu Shu

Recently, I came across the "Compilation of Talented Scholar Books in the Singing Hall," and when I opened the first chapter, it turned out to be Jin Shengtan's "Lecture on the Book of Changes." The Book of Changes is very difficult to explain, and Lin Yutang got into trouble because of it and had to hurriedly fly back to the United States. Jin Shengtan was a master of humor in the early Qing Dynasty, so let's see how he explained the Book of Changes:

"The southern great fire star is uniquely called a star because it is the guiding star. The twenty-eight constellations are astronomy (also known as the twenty-eight gold), the sky is round, the horn has many stars, the neck has many stars, so the horn constellation and the neck constellation are also round, and the rest are the same. East, West, North, South, Above, and Below are geography, objects are mixed so it is called Wen, and mixed without exceeding so it is called Li."

The sky is really too big, and in the eyes of literati, it is really difficult to understand: East is Jia Yi wood, South is Bing Ding fire, and so on, naturally it can fool the villagers; but it also makes people feel that astronomy and geography are inseparable from the five elements of yin and yang. Using astronomy, one can act coquettishly with the emperor and please him; using geography, one can divine burial and discover royal qi. The power of magic is indeed too amazing, but it also finally turned our astronomers and alchemists into one. The "sky" seen in the naked eye is different for each person, and what Jin Shengtan said is just one example.

I think, the alchemists probably had self-awareness at first, and what they did and said was just deception, collecting money, and getting a meal; but later, I don't know why, they became more and more serious. "Looking up to observe the great Wen, Wen is Manjusri; looking down to examine the geography, Puxian is Puxian. The astronomy is round, there is no ordinary person because of it; the geography is square, there is already a Bodhisattva because of it..." Continuing like this, they gradually discovered their own extraordinaryness: believing that what others have not seen, only they can see; what others do not understand, only they can answer with ancestral secrets, the sky that originally only needed to be explored with a telescope, was made more and more mysterious and more and more terrible by them.

Using the identity of a master of humor to cross-dress as a righteous man, rambling on about heaven and earth, refusing to stop, if it is taken as a satire of the alchemists, it is a very humorous thing, but unfortunately it is not, the master is putting on his solemn face. Look at his nonsense:

"Astronomy only allows you to observe, Guanshiyin observes all directions, inside and out, the shadow does not fall in the same container, and then escapes a secluded word. Geography is only three changes, you just wholeheartedly. If you don't achieve the previous method, then there is no cause and no effect, how do you know that the previous is not the later, the later is not the previous, the above and below are also clear, and then you can prove a clear word."

I don't know what he is talking about, I only hear a buzzing sound.

The road from theology to metaphysics is short, but the road from metaphysics to science is long. Chinese literati have been trapped in the pit of metaphysics and cannot extricate themselves; Wang Yangming is still like that, let alone Jin Shengtan. Therefore, I think that it is better for him to comment on the West Chamber and Water Margin than to talk about astronomy and geography.

### Our Accusation - A Call for Support for Newspapers Destroyed in Various Places

— Tang Shan

The press community recently faces a difficult season. It's not just that rising prices and meager incomes have severely threatened their survival. It's also not just that the precarious situation and failed peace talks make it difficult to write and choose words. Even the publication of a short news item often provokes resentment and triggers a huge wave! In the past two months, newspapers in Chengdu, Hankou, Changchun, Fuzhou, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang have been destroyed for such small matters. The strangest thing is that the destroyers are not local thugs, but people belonging to the intellectual class!

China's newspaper industry, like the old "Shen Bao," has a history of more than seventy years, but the true period of prosperity for the newspaper industry has been in the last decade. However, unfortunately, in these ten years, the newspapers in the occupied areas have suffered under the oppression of the enemy and puppets, and dozens of reporters have been martyred. The newspapers in the free areas have faced material and spiritual difficulties, and writing about it is truly full of bitterness - but we have no complaints. We recognize that everything must be for the victory of the war; at the same time, we also remember that there must be a broad future for the press community after the war. The war was won, but we lost all our ideals; but what can we do? People must continue to live, and our work must continue. Even though the newspaper business is so difficult, we still stand on this post, enduring the wind, frost, rain, and snow. The lagging era is whipping us to "catch up," the dark society is forcing us to uphold justice, and various objective circumstances make every conscientious journalist deeply feel that their responsibility is even greater. So everyone puts their personal poverty behind them in the face of arduous work.

For peace and democracy, for the revival of China, this is the common desire of the Chinese people. We express our conscience and also spread the voices of the majority. However, when we slightly touch the pain of a certain person or a certain group, we are subjected to an illegal "punishment" ( (!)) Newspapers can be destroyed, reporters can be beaten, there is no room for defense, no right to comment or accuse. This unfortunate event is more tragic and unbearable than any pain we have suffered in the past ten years!

Newspapers must meet with readers every day, and no one can guarantee that there will be no mistakes. However, right and wrong should be judged through reasonable means. Punishment should only be carried out by government agencies. If everyone can take revenge for personal grievances, then newspapers will never have a chance to be published! Especially those who are members of the intellectual class, who usually call for democracy and lead the masses, how can they use violence against the "mouthpiece of democracy" and the "public opinion of the people"?

Here, I would like to say a word to the members of the press community. The misfortunes we are encountering today, on the other hand, show our strength. Those who destroy public opinion do so because public opinion itself has struck at their vitals. We should be pleased with our suffering.

If the draft regulations on house rentals are enacted, they could break the "gold bar" fortress of Shanghai. Those of us who have no gold bars and no houses to live in don't know how to express our congratulations.

But some of the legal provisions are of no use. For example, "mandatory leasing of surplus houses" and "no taking of tips" (i.e., the most vicious "gold bar" premium set by Shanghainese) cannot be effective unless the security authorities enforce them strictly.

Life is becoming more and more insecure, yet prices are soaring endlessly; the temptations of extravagance, luxury, and licentiousness make the wind of corruption spread without end.

The corruption case in the clothing factory of the General Headquarters of Joint Services is only one end of thousands upon thousands of corruption cases.

The cause of the major fires has been announced by the responsible authorities. Most are due to carelessness with fire; either a discarded cigarette butt caused a major disaster, or other sparks of fire created a terrifying sea of flames. There is no need to be suspicious. Shanghainese themselves being "careful with fire" is the proper way to prevent fires.

Russians open their doors on Easter, and young men can freely enter homes and kiss the girls.

This is the fundamental difference between European and Asian national character.

John Ken said, "Asians are weak and lack perseverance." Customs and habits and private life also show the conservatism and rigidity of Easterners everywhere.

If Chinese girls one day have the courage to welcome the embraces and kisses of male guests, their attitude towards life should be much more open than it is now.

It is said that the Qingbai football team specifically increased its manpower to challenge Donghua in Shanghai, spending over ten million yuan. As a result, this match was aborted. I personally think that "Donghua" should have played the match. As the saying goes, "Victory and defeat are common in war." If it is for the sake of observing each other's skills, even if defeated, it does not matter. Why doesn't Donghua fight?

Some say, if the Japanese football and baseball teams trained under MacArthur come to challenge Shanghai in the future, should our Great Republic of China's teams consider war? (Readers may wish to write their opinions on this matter)

Dying from being squeezed on a train means that, in any case, the two Railway Administrations should bear full responsibility. The Railway Bureau has never been considerate of passengers, but it sells an unlimited number of tickets for each train. The railway authorities should pay great attention to this and improve it.

### "County Magistrate"

— Shao Zhensi

In the newspaper on the 9th, there was this news:

Having been a county magistrate for nine years, he committed 82 crimes, averaging one crime every 40 days.

As a result, he was sentenced to eight death sentences and four life imprisonments. Because there is only one Gu Ying, only one death sentence can be executed. The remaining "residual evils"—seven death sentences and four life imprisonments—have to be buried with Gu Ying!

Nine years in office cannot be considered short, and 82 cases cannot be considered few. Only now has it been exposed. This is a complete depiction of the local gentry's "muddle-headedness."

A parent official committing as many as 82 crimes in nine years shows the power of this local emperor!

Assuming that Gu Ying committed the first case and was then reported and sentenced, then on the day of this "proving his identity," it might be the day of "release after serving his term." It is truly fitting to cry injustice for Gu Ying.

### "Unending Love"

— Wubian

"Unending Love" tells the story of a love affair between a young girl, Yu Jiayin, and a young man, Xia Zongyu. Xia has a wife. In the end, Jiayin leaves in order not to destroy Zongyu's family. Between them, they leave behind this unfinished love.

The author, Zhang Ailing, makes the issue of love and family the theme of the play. But she cannot give you a healthy answer. She still ends this "unending love" inconclusively.

The reason for this inconclusive ending is that the author lacks a sound ideology and discernment. In this story, the love between Chu Jiayin and Xia Zongyu lacks a sound foundation in itself. Jiayin's departure is merely out of selfishness. She does not want others to hate her in the future. She is not an awakening and sympathy for the sake of the happiness of others. She fully expresses the weakness and selfishness in the character of this person; therefore, she only escapes. If Zongyu's wife died in the hospital, and Zongyu chased after her to Xiamen, then they would definitely be together. But how could the future Jiayin not have the same fate as Zongyu's current wife, because Jiayin and Zongyu's wife are not much different? They are not united because of common thoughts and careers.

This subject is a women's issue, but the author does not start from here. She does not focus on women's occupations and lives. She turns the problem to Jiayin's father, and even from this point, she forcibly relates and twists the development of the story and characters. The author can only make the disc fall into failure. The whole play can only end inconclusively.

Secondly, in the writing of the script, it is sometimes comedy and sometimes tragedy. It is extremely inconsistent, which affects the integrity of the performance. Director Sang Hu has obviously put a lot of effort into handling the play, and many small details are arranged very cleverly and appropriately. But there are too many problems with the editing of the play.

Chen Yanyan's Yu Jiayin plays very naturally. The disadvantage is that she cannot grasp several emotional and exciting main scenes. Liu Qiong only has a few scenes and cannot talk about good or bad. Yan Su's Yu father and Lu Shan's Yao mother are both too exaggerated, especially the former. Zhang Fu's Xia's wife has few scenes, but she plays them extremely well.

### Literary and Art Scene

Xu Jie recently had a collection of short stories published by Kaiming Bookstore, entitled "Awkward Collection." Most of the content is about the life of university professors in the rear during the War of Resistance, who are poor, depressed, and mentally distressed, which makes people feel sympathy. The other articles also depict the visage of difficult reality. The author said: "Expose this reality, overthrow this reality, or pursue the light, and foreshadow the beginning of the light!"

The April issue of "Middle School Student" magazine has been published. This issue includes "A Literary Talk by Students and Writers," written by Xiao Qian, Lü Shuxiang, Zang Kejia, Quan Lin, Li Guangtian, Ping Bo, Shi Yi, Ke Zhongping, Cao Bohan, and Ding Yi, which is extremely helpful for readers to understand and learn about literature and art. In addition, there are many articles by Sheng Tao, Bin Ran, Chen Yuan, Gu Junzheng, Xu Cifu, and Zhao Qing Shi.

### Red Notice

— Xia Tianwu

On a modern building, a red notice was posted on a round revolving pillar of cement and steel, which looked a bit obtrusive. However, after all, it was a magnificent notice, which was indeed eye-catching.

When a new official takes office, a red notice is posted as usual, stating that "by order of such and such," he will take office immediately.

After the revolution, the Qing Dynasty was destroyed, and the Republic of China began. Everything was renewed. At that time, red notices were all over the country. Although they were everywhere, the people's hearts were full of excitement and hope. However, when the traitor Yuan usurped power and falsely used titles, the concept that the red notices gave to the people was completely changed, replacing excitement with disgust and hope with contempt. The life of the red notice was dyed gray.

The stage of the revolution and restoration in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China was a rebirth of the people's psychology. In fact, the people seemed to breathe in a breath of fresh air. At that time, there was a characteristic: it seemed that red notices were not often seen. New officials also took office, but it seemed that no one wanted to be scolded as feudal and counter-revolutionary!

What is the meaning of the red notice? It is a feudal relic, I do not agree with it, right? Red is a symbol of auspiciousness, red is a symbol of happiness. Getting a new official, praying for auspiciousness, getting a new official, full of joy, but we on the people's side must think, the so-called auspiciousness, is it for him to auspiciously make money? Full of joy, that is even more unspeakable, not only the new official himself, but even the little brother-in-law's aunt's grandmother's nephew is afraid of getting a joy!

What is the impression and concept of red notices in the minds of the people today? I am afraid it is a piece of numbness. We have eaten oil that costs 4,000 yuan per catty of reserve notes, and today we are eating oil that costs 3,600 yuan per catty of legal tender. What is the fun of red notices? Generally, people who are a little older will have a kind of nostalgia rising, returning to the red notices of the early Republic of China.

Today, I don't want to ask for a good official, can I get a new official who does not want to post a red notice to take office?

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

"Have you packed your things? Let's go!" Zhu Zhaonian of the Machine Battalion urged Lan in this way immediately.

Lan only nodded, and Lao Zhu ran out like a fly, calling Lao Huang and A Li in to help Lan's cousin move things.

At this time, Fatty Xu's face had been slapped several times by his wife, and the Hawaiian shirt on his upper body was also crumpled. Lao Zhu knew that it would be even worse to go up and persuade him, so he winked at Lan.

"Sister-in-law Ming! Sister-in-law Ming!" Lan immediately understood his meaning and hurried over to laugh and shout, "Let Brother-in-law Ming go! It's Zhu's fault! Don't blame him! If you guys do this again, I won't be able to save face either! Let me apologize to you!"

"It's none of your business!" But Mrs. Xu, who is famous for her prestige, is not someone to reason with. "I just want to ask him why he didn't open his dog eyes and make friends with this bastard? I want to divorce him! I want to divorce him!..."

While she was speaking, although she did not let go, her mind was distracted. Fatty Xu took this opportunity, gave a strong tremor, jumped out of the heavy garden, and ran madly out of the door, ignoring his life. So his honorable wife also cried and chased after him.

Lan and Zhu Zhaonian couldn't help but smile bitterly at each other.

This is the train station!

Almost all that one's vision can see is a dark mass. That pile is people, that pile is luggage; those people are going to get on the train, those people are station staff, those people are here to see them off, no one needs to think about distinguishing them. And the movement of people is so chaotic, so endless, that everyone who first comes into contact with this realm will naturally have a misconception, as if even the luggage is moving!

This is still the situation on the road outside the station. Inside the station, it is simply a solid formed by people and luggage. If you grow wings and fly over other people's heads, otherwise you don't have to think about going in.

Lao Zhu took Lan and two children and was blocked on the road four or five hundred yards away from the station. He couldn't see the scene inside the station at all, and he couldn't even see any shadows of the train. All that was heard in the ears was the noisy sound of people, but there was no need to think about hearing a clear and complete sentence. Even they themselves felt it difficult to speak. (43)
