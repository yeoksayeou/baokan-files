### Zhang Qun Attends the参驻会议 (Council-Standing Committee Joint Meeting) to Report on Military Affairs, Diplomacy, and Economy; Actively Researching Controls on Volatile Prices

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Premier Zhang Qun, at the invitation of the Council-Standing Committee Joint Meeting on the morning of the 10th, reported on the general situation of his administration and answered questions, concluding at noon. Zhang's report was roughly divided into three parts: military affairs, diplomacy, and economy. In the end, he detailed the factors influencing the current price fluctuations, pointing out the situation of speculative merchants undermining national laws and regulations and not abiding by the law. He also reported that the Executive Yuan and the All-Economic Commission are currently researching control measures targeting the root causes of price volatility. He mentioned that they will improve shortcomings in the mechanisms and adjust personnel, aiming to achieve both short-term and long-term effects. Zhang's report was detailed; a brief summary is provided below:

Zhang first expressed that the evolution of the current international situation is becoming increasingly complex, and the domestic situation is unstable, making it difficult to provide a detailed account. He then divided his report into three points: military affairs, diplomacy, and economy, as follows:

Recovering the Northeast and Stabilizing North China is a Struggle for National Survival

Military Affairs: After the adjustment of military personnel's compensation, it has increased threefold compared to before August. Although this increases the burden on the national treasury, it is a reasonable adjustment given the instability of life during this time of suppressing the rebellion, and it is the first adjustment of its kind in twenty years. Secondly, regarding military efforts to suppress the bandits, the communist bandits are preparing to launch their sixth offensive on a large scale. The Chinese Communist forces in the Northeast still include a large number of Korean, Mongolian, and Japanese communist troops, reaching 190,000. The total number of communist bandits in the Northeast is about 480,000 to 500,000, with Korean communist troops accounting for one-third. This point should be closely monitored. Furthermore, since the bandit army launched its offensive in the latter part of last month, our military has suffered considerable losses in western Shanxi, and the Beining Railway was once forced to retreat, and the situation was very serious at the time. Fortunately, several armies were transferred from within the pass to provide reinforcements, which turned the crisis into safety, and there is no danger now. Zhang then reviewed the military situation in the Northeast, stating: The current war results, that is, the area of the recovered area, is smaller than in May of this year. The current area of the recovered area only accounts for 9.2% of the total area of the Northeast, the population accounts for 38.9% of the total population of the Northeast, the arable land accounts for 32% of the total area of the Northeast, and the recovery of productivity accounts for 27%. With more people and less land, it will not be easy to recover from an economic point of view, and the economic crisis is even greater. We had long anticipated the communist bandits' offensive in the Northeast, so adjustments have been made in both the mechanisms and personnel. At the same time, the military in Shandong was first concluded, and considerable strength was transferred to support the Northeast. However, the communist bandits have adopted a chaotic method, with Chen Yi and other troops harassing the provinces of Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu, with this very purpose. Zhang stated: We must not only recover the Northeast but also stabilize North China, which is a point that we must fight for for our national survival. Therefore, today's military focus is on the Northeast. Zhang then reported on the significance of organizing local people's defense forces and the content of the measures passed and announced by the Executive Yuan.

### We Wish Japan Peace and Self-Renewal; The Ryukyu Islands Must be Recovered; The Issue of Korea is Still Deadlocked

Diplomacy: Roughly divided into one, our attitude toward the United Nations General Assembly, and two, our attitude toward the Japanese peace treaty, described as follows:

Our Attitude toward the UNGA: The significance of this UNGA is important, so Foreign Minister Wang is attending in person. Our delegation to the meeting has consistently adopted an independent and autonomous stance. The issue related to us raised by the UNGA is "The Use of the Veto." The amendment proposed by China is for conditional use. In the part on the peaceful resolution of international disputes, the veto should be abandoned. The United States did not formally express its opinion on this proposal, and it has now been included in the Political and Security Committee for research. Furthermore, the United States suggested that in the period after the adjournment of the General Assembly but before the amendment of the veto, a council of fifty-seven should be established to represent the General Assembly in performing its tasks. The Soviet Union believes that this violates the basic principles of the United Nations and expressed its opposition, and the United Kingdom also expressed indifference. No results have yet been obtained.

Secondly, regarding the Korean issue, we advocate that China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should negotiate. However, the Soviet Union refused, saying that according to the resolution of the Moscow Conference, it should be decided by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, given the close relationship between China and Korea, this matter is still deadlocked.

The Dutch-Indonesian issue is related to the safety of our overseas Chinese, and we agree that the Security Council should conduct an investigation.

Our Attitude toward the Japanese Peace Treaty: Our principle is "We wish to see Japan peacefully renew itself, but do not want Japan to be a threat to peace, not to adopt a retaliatory approach, but not to give up compensation." The treaty includes several issues: A. Territory, that is, the Ryukyu Islands, we advocate must be recovered; B. Compensation. In this war, our losses were enormous, about 50 billion, and deaths reached over ten million, while the Japanese assets we received were only 900 million U.S. dollars. In the first batch of compensation materials from Japan, we can obtain 400,000 tons, which is currently being negotiated. As for the distribution of cash, the issue of Japanese assets in China is still under negotiation, and Zhu will make the final decision; C. The procedure for drafting the peace treaty. Our State Council has decided that the four countries should first conduct preliminary consultations, and then submit it to the countries concerned for discussion. Secondly, the negotiation and signing of the agreement must not involve the use of the veto, etc.; D. Control Issues. Whether its aggressive ideology should be controlled, China's basic principle on this issue is leniency.

### Bandit Harassment and Speculation Cause Price Volatility

Economy: The Executive Yuan has promulgated two measures, one for fundamental solutions and one for temporary solutions. The temporary solution is the Emergency Economic Measures Program, and the fundamental solution is the Economic Reform Plan. Zhang then analyzed the factors influencing price volatility, which are affecting the stability of the economic order. One is that the military situation makes life unstable. The communist bandits are harassing everywhere, and both grain and cotton are affected. The other is the manipulation of the market by speculative merchants. Recently, one example that could be cited as an excuse is the Supervisory Yuan's publication of a report on the use of foreign exchange. This report only explained the situation of use without stating the situation of income. Merchants believed that the country's foreign exchange had been used up, causing panic and speculation. The gold and banknote market thus raised the wind of rising prices, and the black market was rampant, which is laughable. The second is the handling of materials arriving at the port with self-provided foreign exchange. Before it was passed, there were rumors that it could be unfrozen, causing importers to buy black market foreign exchange everywhere, thinking they could receive the goods arriving at the port, leading to a rise in prices. The All-Economic Commission specially sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate, and the investigation is still ongoing. We believe that there are many factors. For example, the issuance of large banknotes is set to stimulate prices. The Economic Commission is now studying a control measure, preparing to implement it in the short term to achieve results.

### Premier Zhang Answers Questions

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Councilors Wu Zhaoxu, Yu Nanqiu, Zheng Kuiyi, and others raised questions after Zhang Qun's report. Wu proposed that the authorities should not only send personnel to investigate prices, but also severely punish those found guilty, using heavy penalties in turbulent times. Yu believes that some government measures inevitably address the symptoms rather than the root cause. For example, with the issue of banning dancing, without first seeking a way out for the dancers, suddenly banning dancing will inevitably lead to a black market for the dance industry. If this continues, the issue of banning dancing may lead to a repeat of the Shanghai peddler incident. He also said that the adjustment of the compensation of public educators is also the same, and that the increase is not a good strategy. Someone then asked about our diplomatic attitude and production loans, etc., and Zhang gave a comprehensive reply: The method for adjusting the compensation of public educators will still adopt the suggestion of the Legislative Yuan, using the cost of living index method for distribution. The method will be presided over by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government, and a committee will be formed to handle it. Our diplomatic attitude is to hope to achieve world peace. In the past, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship was signed for this purpose. We do not want to be involved in the vortex of world competition. The loans from the Four United Offices will continue to be provided to the following three in the future: A. Production loans for daily necessities; B. Export commodity loans; C. Transportation project loans. The rest will be suspended to prevent funds from flowing into the market and forming floating capital.

### Northeast Industry and Mining are in Deep Crisis; Production Under Fire is Gradually Shrinking; Further Damage May Make Revival Difficult

[Our Shenyang Office, 18th Dispatch] Northeast industry and mining are currently producing under fire, facing a deep crisis. Although work has not stopped amidst the great war, production is gradually shrinking, and some factories will be forced to flee, with great difficulties: The amount is insufficient, such as coal mines cannot be drained, resulting in loss. Transportation is cut off, materials have no source, and products have no way out. Employees are emotionally unstable, and production efficiency is very low. A person in charge of a certain mine said: If the Northeast does not achieve stability in the short term, industry and mining will suffer a fatal blow. If it is unfortunately damaged again, the remaining industrial foundation will be difficult to revive.

### Foreign Minister Wang Leaves the US Tomorrow; Ambassador Wei Reports that US Newspapers Believe it is Inappropriate to Keep the Report Secret; Deciding on a China Policy is the Sooner, the Better

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] Foreign Minister Wang will leave here on the 20th to return to the country. He will stop briefly in Tokyo on his way home to exchange views with General MacArthur and General Shang Zhen.

[Associated Press, New York, 17th] An editorial in the Scripps-Howard newspapers stated: "We believe that there is no reason to withhold the Wedemeyer Report for more than a month. Undoubtedly, Wedemeyer has provided some confidential strategies that are not suitable for publication. If this is the case, then this action is understandable. But this cannot be used as an excuse to keep ordinary reports secret. We are well aware that Truman and Marshall are busy with affairs, but the urgency of the China problem is second to none. Because the United States is sitting on the fence, Moscow and the Chinese Communists are taking advantage of this to make progress, so the sooner Washington announces a firm policy toward China and acts on this policy, the better."

[Associated Press, New York, 18th] The Herald Tribune commented on the Wedemeyer Report, saying: "Wedemeyer's report remains strictly confidential to this day, because the United States' new policy toward China is still undecided. The reason why the United States is in a dilemma is because: it would be absurd to pour millions of dollars into China to enrich private individuals or waste them. However, it would be equally absurd to see the Communist Party gain victory in China at this time."

Weekly Forum

### A Thorough Review of Sino-American Relations

— Cheng Tianfang

Mr. Caffery, the American Ambassador to France, recently published a sweeping "Impressions of China" in "Life Magazine," analyzing the current situation in China in great detail. On one hand, he urged the U.S. government to continue aiding China; on the other hand, he urged the Chinese government to implement eighteen reforms. He also advocated that President Truman send General MacArthur to China to establish a joint plan to prevent the Soviet Union from annexing China. After this article was published, it attracted attention and commentary from both China and the United States. Regardless of whether we fully agree with Mr. Caffery's conclusions, his detailed observations of the Chinese situation, deep understanding, and the friendship towards China that permeates his words are worthy of our praise. However, Mr. Caffery's article almost completely fails to describe the change in American public opinion in recent years and the misunderstandings of China among the American people, which have affected Sino-American relations. The United States is a democratic country, and public opinion has a great influence on the government's policy decisions. Therefore, at the request of the Shen Bao, I am writing this essay to conduct a review of the current Sino-American relations from a Chinese perspective, on the one hand to provide reference for those who are concerned about Sino-American relations, and on the other hand, I hope to seek correction from Mr. Caffery and American friends.

From early February to the end of August of this year, I stayed in the United States for nearly seven months. From the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast, I traveled to more than twenty large and small cities, and visited many famous universities, newspapers, factories, and academic organizations. Because I wanted to understand the opinions of all levels of American society, in addition to visiting government officials, members of Congress, university presidents, professors, newspaper editors, scientists, writers, labor union leaders, and business tycoons, whenever I had the opportunity, I talked to newspaper reporters, university students, store clerks, factory workers, restaurant waiters, taxi drivers, housewives, and passengers on planes and trains, asking them about their views on the United States, China, and the world as a whole. I talked to about 5,000 people in total. As a result of talking to so many people, I came to the conclusion that the average American (The Man in the Street) has an extremely incorrect understanding of China. In their minds, the current China is full of chaos and darkness. They do not understand why, two years after the end of the war, when countries are gradually moving towards peace and stability, internal wars are still constantly breaking out in China. They consider China a mystery, an incredible country, and a world apart from the United States. In newspapers and magazines, one can often see criticisms and accusations of China. They believe that the government is incompetent, officials are corrupt, the economy has reached the brink of collapse, and the people's suffering has reached an unbearable level. In short, they are despondent about China, believing that despite the eight years of war, China is still the traditional China, always the same, and will never reform and progress. Therefore, some people (Professor Nathaniel Peffer is a prominent example) advocate a hands-off policy towards China, no longer lending money to China, and letting China sort itself out.

What is particularly strange is that the vast majority of the American people—perhaps more than 95 percent—are opposed to communism and advocate using all kinds of forces to stop its development. Therefore, they are willing to use large sums of money to help European countries threatened by communism. There is an Un-American Activities Committee in the U.S. Congress, and the federal government has the Federal Bureau of Investigation, specializing in monitoring and investigating the activities of the Communist Party. Federal civil servants found to be members of the Communist Party are immediately dismissed. In recent months, dozens of civil servants have been dismissed because of their ties to the Communist Party. But they take a different view of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They believe that the CCP is different from the Communist parties in other countries and is a moderate rural reform faction that advocates land reform but not riots and killings. They believe that the CCP has no connection with the Soviet Union or world communism. They even believe that the CCP is a democratic political party that advocates freedom of speech, thought, and publication, while the Kuomintang (KMT) is a dictatorial political party that opposes all freedoms. Therefore, some of them even believe that the people in the CCP-occupied areas are "happier" than the people in the KMT-controlled areas. They call those who support the CCP progressives and liberals, while those who oppose the CCP are labeled as stubborn and reactionary, almost exactly as the CCP propagates domestically.

Six years ago, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, American public opinion heaped endless praise on China. Here are a couple of examples: The New York Times editorial on July 8, 1943, stated: "The whole world owes China a debt, because China suffered alone and we benefited. Now, although it is late, this debt should be paid off." James L. McConaughy, President of Wesleyan University, was even more explicit in his address when he took office as chairman of the United China Relief in July 1942. He said: "From the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States lived on borrowed time. We owe China a debt, because these years were given to us by China. We will never be able to repay it! In these years, our cities, our homes, our children were all preserved, while China was ruthlessly devastated!" Compared with these words at that time, and today's American public opinion, it is simply a 180-degree turn.

What are the factors that caused this change? Of course, after the victory, we were disappointing, and exposed many shortcomings in political and economic aspects, which disappointed the friendly countries that sympathized with China, and this is undeniable. However, in addition to this, the following factors caused the change in American perception of China:

First, the constant propaganda of the Communist Party and fellow travelers in the United States over the years. The Communist Party is an extremely secretive international organization, and all Communist Party members around the world obey the orders of Moscow, so their actions abroad are consistent regardless of national borders. Since the CCP opposes the government, the American Communist Party (CPUSA) naturally opposes the Chinese government as well. Since the CCP denigrates the government as dictatorial, autocratic, and anti-democratic, the CPUSA naturally places the same labels on the Chinese government. Because the U.S. government fundamentally opposes communism, the publications of the Communist Party have very few sales, and the influence of the CPUSA's attacks on the Chinese government is not very great. But the fellow travelers of the Communist Party are different. On the surface, they are non-partisan liberals, but in reality, they are doing propaganda for the Communist Party without realizing it. For example, the writings, speeches, and broadcasts of Edgar Snow and Michael Lindsay have had a great impact. In particular, academic and cultural organizations related to China also have Communist Party members or fellow travelers infiltrating them. They use their qualifications as experts on Far Eastern issues to express their opinions on China. The general public is easily able to accept this without discernment, creating misunderstandings about the Chinese government and the CCP.

Second, the reports of American correspondents stationed in China during the war. These reporters lived in the rear of China during the war. The comfort of their lives was not only far inferior to that of the United States, but also inferior to that of Hong Kong and Shanghai, so they naturally felt pain. In addition, China implemented strict censorship during the war, and foreign reporters suffered all kinds of inconveniences. Therefore, when they returned to their home country, most of them expressed dissatisfaction with China. The most prominent example is Theodore White. When White was a correspondent for Life Magazine in China, he also wrote faithful reports, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also read them sincerely (see Life Magazine, May 1, 1944). However, his book "Thunder Out of China," published this year, completely distorts the facts, and is full of exaggeration, fabrication, and seemingly correct descriptions. He attacks the Chinese government to the greatest extent possible, makes all kinds of false accusations against Chiang Kai-shek, and praises the CCP to the extreme. He even said: "Those who have traveled within the territory of the CCP-occupied areas have escaped from the oppression of the Kuomintang and entered the area of light." Because his book is vividly written and uses the style of stories to describe the events before and after the war, it is very popular among Americans, with sales of hundreds of thousands of copies. White himself has reaped both fame and fortune, but the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples has suffered a great blow.

Third, during the Roosevelt administration, many "American communists" and fellow travelers infiltrated various departments of the U.S. government, including the State Department. These government secretaries used their positions to do work to protect the CCP. For example, reports that are beneficial to China are shelved and not sent to superiors or made public. Reports that are detrimental to the Chinese government are leaked. This alone has had a great impact on China. John Carter Vincent, the former Director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs at the State Department, who was in charge of diplomacy, had great prejudices on Chinese issues. He often criticized the Chinese government and supported the Communist Party. At the end of February this year, he even attacked the Chinese government in front of Chinese officials at a banquet for a business group in New York.

Fourth, the impressions brought back by American officers and soldiers stationed in China. During the late stage of the war, tens of thousands of U.S. Army and Air Force officers and soldiers were stationed in Kunming, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guilin, and other places in the rear of China. They came with a full of enthusiasm to fight alongside Chinese soldiers or train Chinese troops. However, they inevitably became disappointed when they arrived in China. Because even though we sincerely welcomed them, due to the limitations of material conditions, their lives were certainly far less comfortable than they were in the United States. Especially when traveling inland, they were surprised by the low standard of living of the people in Chinese small towns and villages. They naturally did not do things as quickly and conveniently in China as they did in the United States. During the great retreat on the Xiang-Gui Railway in 1944, they also felt the chaos of everything in China. Because of these reasons, the feelings they brought back when they returned to their country were mostly bad and few good. They were not organized and did not contain any political meaning, but they told their relatives and friends about their impressions in China. However, because these veterans were distributed throughout the country, the impact was quite large. I have met many Americans who have never been to China and have never read books about China, but they have had bad feelings about the Chinese government. After investigation, they learned that it came from American veterans.

Fifth, the words and deeds of the Chinese people in the United States. The "China Daily News," run by the CCP in New York, constantly carries out propaganda to destroy the credibility of the Kuomintang and the government. Among the students studying abroad, there are also many people who speak for the CCP. In Boston, I saw an English magazine published by a student group, in which there were several articles attacking the government, which were no less fierce than the reports in American newspapers and magazines. What is most strange is that some senior officials who went to the United States for inspection took a large amount of foreign exchange given by the government to go abroad, but when they arrived in the United States, they carried out extensive anti-government propaganda. There are also Chinese professors at American universities who are extremely critical of the government. For example, in early April this year, Princeton University held a bicentennial celebration, with an exhibition of Chinese art and a lecture on Chinese issues. Many left-leaning sinologists and Chinese professors were invited to give lectures. The next day, a New York newspaper published a news report saying that what everyone found strange at the lecture on Chinese issues yesterday was that those who attacked the Chinese government the most severely were not Americans, but a certain Chinese professor teaching at the Far Eastern Institute of the University of Washington. A few days later, I went to visit Princeton, and the local international students showed me the manuscripts of each person's speech that day. This professor attacked the government for corruption, depravity, and oppression of the people, describing them in great detail, and exceeding the remarks made by the left-leaning sinologists by several times.

The above five factors have created the unfavorable impressions that the American people have of China today. The most important of these is, of course, the planned propaganda of the Communist Party. In addition to the fourth factor, the other second, third, and fifth factors are also directly or indirectly related to the Communist Party and fellow travelers. Why does the Communist Party do this? Because placing the entire China under Communist rule is an important step in the Communist Party's world revolution. The reason why this plan has not yet been realized is that, on the one hand, the Kuomintang is leading the people to resolutely oppose communism, and on the other hand, the strength of the United States is supporting the Chinese government in resisting Communist aggression. Therefore, the CCP does its best to sabotage and disrupt the country, attempting to subvert the government. The CPUSA spreads propaganda about China's weaknesses and vilifies the Chinese government, causing the United States to lose sympathy for China and isolating China, in order to facilitate the CCP's sabotage.

The Communist Party's work to sow discord between the Chinese and American peoples is not only being done in the United States, but also in China. In the United States, they expose China's weaknesses and fabricate propaganda about how corrupt, depraved, and incompetent the Chinese government is, distorting the facts and exaggerating them. In China, on the contrary, they do their best to promote the atrocities of the U.S. military and how the United States is interfering in China's internal affairs, arousing the Chinese people's antipathy towards the United States. Then, they turn around and use these incidents to tell the Americans how strong the anti-American sentiment is in China now, and why the Americans should not go to help China anymore. (In February this year, Ms. Stevenson, the Executive Secretary of the United China Aid Association of America, personally told me that she felt regret that there was an anti-American movement in China now. After I explained that this was a conspiracy of the Communist Party, she suddenly understood.) As the feelings between the Chinese and American peoples become more and more distant, the Communist Party laughs secretly from the sidelines: "You fools, you have all been fooled by me and don't even know it."

Therefore, American newspapers and magazines exaggerate China's shortcomings and attack China mercilessly (of course, there are also those who uphold justice and speak fairly for China, but those are in the minority), which makes us feel extremely troubled and think that this is an extremely unfortunate phenomenon in Sino-American friendship. However, we must remain calm and patient, and must not act impulsively or launch a counterattack, inadvertently stepping into the trap set by the Communist Party. I believe we should have the following views on American public opinion:

First, newspapers in any country like to sensationalize, exaggerate, and publish stimulating news (Sensational News), and American newspapers are even more so. Therefore, they easily go overboard and go to extremes when talking about good or bad, not only to China, but also to other countries and domestic news. Once we know this situation, we can take a more relaxed view of the praises and criticisms of American public opinion, and not pay too much attention to it. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, American public opinion praised us fiercely, and we really felt a little "ashamed to receive it" and should not be happy because of it. Today, American public opinion has swung to another extreme, criticizing us mercilessly. In light of past events, we do not need to be angry because of it.

Second, the American national character is frank and straightforward, sometimes even bordering on rude, which is exactly the opposite of the British national character of being implicit and profound. American newspapers often report on a person or thing nakedly without any concealment. When Americans talk to you, even if they have just met you, they can ask you many questions without hesitation, which makes you feel embarrassed, but they really do not have any malice. Therefore, in addition to the Communist Party and fellow travelers who have ulterior motives, we can only say that the criticisms, attacks, and accusations of China in American public opinion are misunderstandings and rudeness, and we do not need to think that they have embarked on the path of anti-Chinese or anti-China.

Third, American newspapers are used to speaking casually. They not only criticize foreign governments, but also criticize and attack their own governments in the same ruthless way. For example, when President Roosevelt was in office, some newspapers and magazines said that he was a dictator and that his New Deal was an extremist approach. How could the people who wrote these articles not know that Roosevelt did not want to be a dictator at all, and that the New Deal was tens of thousands of miles away from extremism? But for the sake of speaking their minds happily, they did so without realizing it. It is even more common for mayors of the city to be attacked by local newspapers. If we look at the words used by the opposition party to attack the mayors of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, or San Francisco, we will feel that these cities are almost the most depraved and corrupt places in the world!

Fourth, the merciless attacks of American public opinion on China are certainly embarrassing to us. General Wedemeyer's open lecture to China in his capacity as a special envoy to China is especially rude in terms of diplomatic etiquette. However, if we remove the emotional component and think about it calmly, we cannot but admit that some of the things that the United States has pointed out are also facts. We ourselves do have many shortcomings, because we do not need to read American newspapers, but if we read Chinese newspapers, how can we not see repeated reports exposing the corruption of officials and the incompetence of government offices? Therefore, we can laugh off the words of American public opinion that are exaggerated. We can use correct propaganda methods to explain to the American people the malicious slanders. But what is said to the point is worth our vigilance and reflection, and can be used as a reference for our political and economic reforms. If the internal affairs of China can become clearer day by day as a result, then American public opinion will become the stone from other mountains that can polish our jade, and we will benefit from it instead.

In summary, we must not let the temporary reversal of American public opinion towards us affect the traditional and valuable friendship between China and the United States. This friendship is worth our extreme cherish, because among the world's great powers (including the defeated countries in the First and Second World Wars), the United States is the only country that has not used force to seize our territory and dependencies, and has not demanded concessions and spheres of influence. Since John Hay announced the Open Door Policy in China in the nineteenth century, the United States has spoken out for justice in many international conferences and has spoken many fair words for China. During the war of resistance, the United States supplied us with Lend-Lease materials (although the amount was much less than that given to Britain and the Soviet Union, this was because the Chinese coastline was blockaded and materials could not be imported, so until the victory of the war, there were still many materials in India that had not been shipped). The United States equipped our army with American equipment, sent army and air force personnel to train our army, and borrowed gold to stabilize our legal currency. Many Americans tightened their belts to help our refugees. After Japan surrendered, the American Air Force transported a large number of our troops to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin to take over the cities. Of the six or seven hundred million U.S. dollars used by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for relief work in China, 70 percent was provided by the United States. All of this proves that the United States has sincerely helped China and deserves our deep gratitude. Of course, Roosevelt's signing of the Yalta Agreement was something that was unfair to China and was a stain on American diplomatic history. However, Roosevelt's health was already very weak at that time and he could not withstand Stalin's pressure, so he rashly gave in. Many Americans are extremely dissatisfied with this matter now, and we do not need to blame it on the entire United States. In the past year, some things the American government has done have disappointed us, and the criticisms of American public opinion have embarrassed us, but we cannot let temporary differences obscure the good intentions that people have shown us in the past. This is definitely not the demeanor that a great nation should have, nor does it conform to the Chinese ancient teaching of "repaying kindness with kindness."

Of course, we also sincerely hope that American public opinion circles will cherish China's friendship with the United States. Even though China is still a poor and weak country and cannot provide much help to the United States internationally, it would be a pity to easily lose the friendship that 450 million people have cultivated over 50 years of history. Therefore, we hope that American journalists and writers of all kinds will not indulge in the pleasure of writing for a moment and unnecessarily stimulate the feelings of the Chinese people. In particular, they must not inadvertently become propaganda tools for the Communist Party. In addition, there is another stumbling block to Sino-American friendship, which is the American sense of racial superiority. Many Americans (certainly not all) always feel that white people are the chosen people and that yellow people cannot be mentioned in the same breath as them. Therefore, there is a contradiction in the United States, which is that in politics and diplomacy, Americans often help China, but in social interactions and daily contact, Americans often intentionally or unintentionally reveal a psychology of looking down on Chinese people. Although it is much better now than it was before the war, it can still be embarrassing for Chinese people at times. This situation is even more prevalent among Americans who come to China. As Caffery said: "Many Americans come to China with only limited power for a short period of time, and they mix the power, might, strength, and rule of the United States with their own personality, looking down on the Chinese people they come into contact with, who, from a human standpoint, are above them." The New York Herald Tribune criticized American merchants in China, saying: "They are proudly different and never maintain close and friendly relations with Chinese people... They despise Chinese ethics and practices and congratulate themselves on not being subjected to these constraints." If this mentality of the American people is not completely changed, a little shadow will more or less remain on the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples, which is a pity.

### The Council of Advisors Passes Two Proposals

[Continued from Page 1] The proposal to effectively protect overseas Chinese returning to their homeland, with the following measures: 1. Instruct customs officials to facilitate the passage of luggage carried by overseas Chinese returning home and strictly prohibit extortion by customs officials. 2. Allow overseas Chinese returning home to retain a reasonable amount of foreign currency to prepare for expenses when leaving the country. 3. Strictly prohibit harassment by military police and protect overseas Chinese returning home who are not familiar with the national situation. 4. In areas with overseas Chinese in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, the conscription system should be changed to a voluntary military system, as in Shanghai. 5. Strictly punish officials and heads of baojia in areas with overseas Chinese who take the opportunity to extort or illegally oppress overseas Chinese and their families.

The proposal to actively develop water conservancy projects in the Northeast to prevent floods: The Northeast Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau has responded to this need by submitting a five-year plan for water conservancy projects and a project to close breaches and restore embankments on the main and tributary streams of the Liao River in the middle and lower reaches, which can be said to address both the root cause and symptoms. The government should allocate special funds to supervise the implementation. 2. Further suggestions: the government should allocate large sums of money to start with dredging river channels, organizing equipment, and training navigators. Then, connect the Liao River and Songhua River with the Songyuan Canal, which is between Yingkou and Jiyang in southern Liaoning, to complete the major north-south waterway. 3. Develop farmland water conservancy: The enemy and puppet regimes have completed 4,610,215 mu of irrigation and drainage areas and land improvement projects, and 3,032,610 mu have not been completed. Many of those completed after the victory have been destroyed, and those not completed have stopped construction. The government should supervise the provinces and cities of the Northeast to cooperate with the Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau to quickly rectify the recovered areas and continue construction. 4. Monitor water power generation: There are 45 hydroelectric power plants in the Northeast that can generate 5.7 million kilowatts. The enemy and puppet regimes have completed Xiaofengman, Shuifeng, and Jingbo Lake, etc. After the victory, Xiaofengman was destroyed, and Shuifeng and Jingbo Lake are in the areas occupied by bandits. The government is requested to strictly order the national army to protect Xiaofengman with all its strength, and to repair and allocate it. For those not recovered, the government is also requested to recover them as soon as possible. Measures: 1. Broadly raise water conservancy funds, 2. Cultivate specialized talents, 3. Adjust the Northeast water conservancy institutions.

### Supplemental Record of Wang Chonghui's Remarks

Yesterday's first page carried Wang Chonghui's remarks on "Japan's Admission to the United Nations." The latter part was omitted, resulting in a title without text. The supplement is as follows: "According to international law, the victorious nation may listen to the opinions of the defeated nation, but the procedure is that the peace treaty is drafted by the victorious nation and then submitted to the defeated nation for research, and the defeated nation is allowed to submit written opinions. The defeated nation may also be allowed to send personnel to attend the peace conference to express opinions or answer inquiries orally, but all of this depends on the decision of the Allied nations. However, at this time, the Allied nations have not yet held preliminary peace conferences with Japan, and the war against Japan has not yet ended legally. Japan is still an enemy country of the United Nations. Who would be willing to unite with it? The Japanese government and the public have repeatedly mentioned the peace conference, and the attempt to join the Allied nations is still news. Here, he pointed out that Katayama's hope to join the United Nations in his remarks was to ask for a high price, and his real intention was still to mix into the peace conference. This kind of conspiracy must be seen by the world, and the people of our country must be especially clear!"

### UN General Assembly Sets Up Standing Committee Case; British Propose Compromise Suggestions; Gromyko Says He Will Never Compromise

[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] Today it was learned that regarding Marshall's proposal to establish an annual "Small General Assembly" committee, the first priority is to vote to organize a drafting group to review the differences between the original proposal and the amendments proposed by various countries.

The US delegation is confident that it can be supported by a majority of countries, including China, the United Kingdom, and France, while other countries will oppose it. Soviet representative Gromyko said yesterday that any amendment would have no effect on the Soviet Union, and that the US plan violated the UN Charter and was illegal.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th] The United States today submitted to the UN Secretariat the long-awaited plan for Korean independence, advocating that free elections should be held in Korea by March 31 next year to establish a Korean national government and to withdraw all occupying forces as soon as possible. The US proposal also advocates that the UN establish a Korean Temporary Commission to observe the Korean elections and to provide consultations for organizing the Korean national government. The United States also advocates or concludes an agreement on the withdrawal of US troops from Korea. The Temporary Commission also has the right to report and make recommendations to the UN General Assembly on actions to maintain Korean independence.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th] US Representative to the UN General Assembly Dulles said at a press conference today that the US proposal on Korea aims to enable Korea to gain its deserved independence and freedom as soon as possible. He said that the United States has decided to delete the trusteeship of Korea as stipulated in the Moscow Agreement of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom in December 1945. He continued that the purpose of the US submitting the Korean issue to the UN General Assembly is to borrow the moral strength of this world organization to break the stalemate between the US and the Soviet Union on Korea in the past two years. When Dulles mentioned the Soviet Union's proposal that the US and the Soviet Union withdraw their troops at the same time, he said that there is a major difference between the Soviet Union's proposal and the current US proposal. To be clear, the United States hopes to establish a Korean national government first and then withdraw its troops, while the Soviet proposal advocates the opposite. He continued that there are only 45,000 US troops in South Korea, while the number of Soviet troops in North Korea is 90,000, and there are another 120,000 Korean troops equipped by the Soviet Union. He also said that there are a total of 30 million residents in South Korea and only 10 million in North Korea. Future elections should adopt a proportional representation system. Dulles continued that under the current circumstances, the US plan is the best way to resolve the Korean issue. He finally said that the US government had consulted with the governments of China and the United Kingdom before submitting its plan to the General Assembly, and that the proposed UN Korean Temporary Commission would be composed of 10 to 12 countries. They will try to do more inspections in Korea to make world opinion pay attention to and urge the Korean elections.

### US Proposes to Soviet Union; Mixed Committee Adjourns; Awaiting UN General Assembly to Handle

[Associated Press, Seoul, 18th] In the 62nd US-Soviet Joint Commission here, US representative Brown suggested, "In view of the US proposal in the United Nations on October 17, the US delegation recommends that the Joint Commission should postpone the meeting and await the action of the United Nations." Soviet representative Sithkov requested a fifteen-minute recess and replied, "Regarding the US proposal to postpone the meeting, he will inquire about the opinion of his government."

### Partition Plan for Palestine Difficult to Obtain Legal Majority

[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] People here express great doubt about whether the proposed partition of Palestine can obtain the necessary two-thirds majority in the final vote of the UN General Assembly. It is noteworthy that most Latin American delegations have expressed silence on this. Another noteworthy point is that the position of the Soviet bloc is not consistent. Although the Soviet Union supports partition, Yugoslavia supports the two races forming a federation.

### Different Motivations for US and Soviet Support [Reuters, London, 17th] Sir Hugh, the British representative in Palestine, said today that the Soviet Union and the United States have different motivations for supporting partition. The United States' motivation is to obtain Jewish votes in New York State. The Soviet Union's motivation is more cunning than the United States. The Soviet Union is now able to insert its foot into the Middle East on completely equal terms with the United Kingdom and the United States in one fell swoop.

### Asian Economic Commission Expands Scope; Soviet Suggestion Vetoed

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 17th] The Soviet Union proposed to the UN Economic Committee on the 17th that colonies should be allowed to participate in the Asian Economic Commission without the permission of the sovereign state. When the case was put to a vote, it was rejected by a vote of 19 to 13.

### French Municipal Elections Held Today; US Officials Express Great Concern

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 18th Broadcast: Washington News, officials here attach great importance to the French municipal elections to be held tomorrow in order to test what impact the US economic assistance to France has had. The United States has transferred US$247 million in gold and credit loans to France in the past five days.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] The members of the US Senate Appropriations Committee who arrived in France for investigation have met with French Prime Minister Ramadier, Foreign Minister Bidault, and Finance Minister Schuman. According to Committee Chairman Bridges: "French cabinet members have assured us that the French Communist Party will never enter the government."

[Central News Agency, London, 17th Associated Press] British Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman, Republican Senator Bridges, said today that the members of the Committee have informed the French government that the speed and amount of US aid to France will depend entirely on whether France excludes communism and stops strikes. He also said, "We have stated that we cannot tolerate communism."

[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] French Prime Minister Ramadier told the striking Paris transportation workers that the government would not consider their wage increase demands if they did not return to work. However, 33,000 public transportation workers still voted to continue the strike in a general meeting today.

### France, the Netherlands, Austria, Italy and Other Countries Share Nazi Gold; France Gets More Than $100 Million Alone

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] The Three-Country Committee decided on the 18th to make the first distribution of Nazi gold in Allied countries. France received a huge amount, worth $104,150,000, the Netherlands received $40,376,000, Austria received $29,460,000, and Italy received $4,280,000. The distribution of gold to France is especially meaningful as it is a few days before the French municipal elections. The French Communist Party wants to take power, and the government wants to give the people good news.

### Burmese Prime Minister Requests to Attend the Japanese Peace Conference; Anglo-Burmese Treaty Signed in London

[Associated Press, London, 17th] A government spokesman announced today that Prime Minister Attlee has signed a treaty with Burmese Prime Minister Thein Kin Nu, officially allowing Burma to complete its independence in January next year. The Burmese Prime Minister said: Once the transfer of power is completed, Burma will apply to join the United Nations organization and intends to send representatives to the future Japanese peace conference to request to share Japanese compensation.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] The King of England met with Burmese Prime Minister Thein Kin Nu at Buckingham Palace after the signing of the Anglo-Burmese Treaty.

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] President Truman today appointed Hurtle as the first US Ambassador to Burma.

### Allied Headquarters Order Japan to Implement Economic Decentralization

[US News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] New York Times correspondent Crane reported that Allied Headquarters ordered Japan to implement the following new measures for economic decentralization: Companies in the following circumstances will be dissolved: 1. Those who control 5% of any important material; 2. Those whose business activities are sufficient to affect prices or exchange rates; 3. Those who merged after 1941. An economic decentralization bill has now been submitted to the Japanese Congress, with an order from the Supreme Commander's Headquarters that the bill must be passed quickly. Headquarters officials expect some action to be taken within a week.

### Contents of the Anglo-American Trade Agreement Approved by the British Cabinet; Decision to Reduce Imperial Preference

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] A State Department spokesman stated: The United States has made tariff concessions to Britain on many commodities. It is believed on all sides that the Anglo-American trade agreement has been approved by the British Cabinet and will be signed soon. The spokesman also revealed that relative trade agreements with Britain and several other countries will be formally signed on November 16, without the need for parliamentary approval, and will take effect on January 1, 1948. The spokesman declined to disclose the details of the tariff concessions, but said that textiles, porcelain, automobiles, and whiskey were all included. As for the concessions made by Britain to the United States, although details have not been revealed, it is only known that Britain has agreed to reduce the imperial trade preference system by 25 percent within two years. This British concession is contingent upon the United States not promulgating new barriers to certain products from British colonies. Overall, this agreement will provide Britain with immediate benefits, while the benefits to the United States will be more long-term.

[United Press, Zurich, 17th] The chief U.S. representative to the International Trade Preparatory Conference, Mr. Clair Wilcox, stated that the resignation of U.S. Undersecretary of State Clayton will not affect the tariff negotiations and the Havana Conference.

### Brazilian Authorities Draft Note of Severance of Relations with the Soviet Union

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 16th (Radio): A report from the capital of Brazil in the "Manhna" newspaper states that on Friday night, the President of Brazil held a meeting with the Foreign Minister. Some people believe that the two may have been working on drafting a note of severance of relations with the Soviet Union.

### American Machinery to Cease Being Shipped to the Soviet Union

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 18th (Radio): U.S. officials revealed that U.S.-Soviet relations have now reached a showdown. U.S. economic officials predict that the U.S. will stop shipping machinery to the Soviet Union in order to transport more materials to European countries implementing the Marshall Plan. There are two main reasons for this: the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with the Marshall Plan; and the limited production of machinery in the United States, which is not sufficient to supply all the countries that need it. In addition, the Soviet Union's refusal to explain the purpose of its purchase of machinery is also a reason for the U.S. to stop shipping machinery to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's inability to obtain machinery from the United States will greatly frustrate the Soviet Union's five-year construction plan. Currently, U.S. exports to the Soviet Union have been greatly reduced. In the first half of 1946, U.S. exports to the Soviet Union (including lend-lease materials) were worth $223 million, but in the first half of this year, they have decreased to $91 million.

Thorough Review of Sino-American Relations (Continuation from page 2 · Cheng Tianfang)

Some people say that the reason why the United States is assisting China is for its own benefit. Others even say that the purpose of the United States helping China become a prosperous country is to turn China into an American market to promote American goods. Indeed, the foreign policy of any country in the world is based on its own position, and there is no country that only considers the interests of others without considering its own interests. May I ask, isn't our Chinese foreign policy also based on China's position? The United States has always believed that a strong and prosperous China can become a stabilizing force in the Far East and can contribute to world peace, which is also in the interest of the United States, and its assistance to China starts from this position. This policy is completely consistent with China's interests, and the traditional friendship between China and the United States is built on this common understanding. If this is said to be American selfishness, it can also be said to be Chinese selfishness, but this kind of selfishness is "enlightened selfishness," because it is beneficial to oneself and also beneficial to others, which is the cornerstone of international cooperation. Compared with ambitious countries that want to take China as their sphere of influence or support China's internal strife to achieve their aggressive purposes, that kind of selfish policy is truly incomparable. If China prospers and the people's purchasing power increases, the sales of American goods can be greatly expanded, which is naturally beneficial to the United States; but at the same time, China's production can also increase and the people's living standards can also improve. As long as China maintains the right to tariff autonomy, the development of international trade will definitely not be harmful to China.

Some people also believe that China's recent diplomacy has completely followed the United States and has become the tail of the United States, losing China's independent and autonomous status. This view is obviously influenced by Communist propaganda and is very wrong. It is true that in many international conferences, the United States' proposals often receive China's support, and on certain international issues, China and the United States often take the same actions. But this is the result of the same interests and consistent national policies between China and the United States, and it cannot be said that one is the tail of the other. For example, after the Pearl Harbor incident, China, Britain, and the United States jointly fought against Japan. This was based on the common position of safeguarding peace and resisting aggression. It cannot be said that Britain and the United States became the tail of China, nor can it be said that China became the tail of Britain and the United States. For example, at the Cairo Conference, President Roosevelt advocated fairness and insisted that the northeastern provinces, Taiwan, and Penghu should be returned to China, which was completely consistent with China's position. Can we say that this was the United States becoming China's tail? Moreover, China's foreign policy is not consistent with the United States in everything. For example, on the issue of the peace conference with Japan, because the pain we have suffered from Japanese aggression is far greater than that suffered by the United States, our understanding of the Japanese nation is also more profound than that of the average American. Therefore, China's view on the Japanese issue is different from that of the United States, and the proposals put forward by China are also different from those of the United States. This incident can illustrate that China has not abandoned its own position and followed the Americans in everything; at the same time, it can also illustrate that on other issues, China and the United States are often consistent, and China is definitely not the tail of the United States, and it will definitely not affect China's independent and autonomous status because of this. If we say that no matter what the United States proposes, we must disagree in order to show China's independent and autonomous style, then the so-called international cooperation will never be possible, and the "United Nations" will inevitably disintegrate.

Recently, the country has emphasized self-reliance. Therefore, some people doubt whether we should still ask the United States for assistance or accept American assistance in the future. Self-reliance is obviously the correct guide, but self-reliance and accepting foreign aid are not conflicting things. China is now facing severe internal and external troubles. There are great crises lurking in politics, economy, and society. If the people of the whole country cannot strengthen themselves and overcome difficulties with a spirit of hardship and perseverance, and rely solely on foreign aid, then China will inevitably embark on a path of collapse. This is why we want to promote self-reliance. But on the other hand, because we want to be self-reliant, we must reject foreign aid, which is like "refusing to eat for fear of choking." Let us take Britain as an example: In the late 19th century, Britain was the richest country in the world, and London was the world's financial center. After the First World War, its position gradually wavered. During the Second World War, Britain suffered even more severe blows, its national wealth was greatly reduced, and its foreign exchange was almost exhausted. Last spring, it borrowed a huge sum of 3.75 billion U.S. dollars from the United States to barely overcome the difficulties. But it was originally planned to last for four years, but it started to be used in July last year, and by the end of August this year, 3.35 billion U.S. dollars had been used, leaving only 400 million. Therefore, at the beginning of August, Prime Minister Attlee announced emergency measures, requiring people to be more economical in consumption and increase production, while greatly restricting the import of various goods. This is Britain's self-reliance. But Britain has not given up its attempt to borrow huge sums of money from the United States again. On the one hand, she can get a share of the entire European aid plan, and on the other hand, she continues to negotiate for separate loans. Britain still needs foreign aid so much. China's financial resources before the war were far less than those of Britain, and the damage suffered during the war was far greater than that of Britain. Why don't we need foreign aid to support our post-war reconstruction work? We are the country that has fought the longest and sacrificed the most, so we have the right to ask our allies for assistance in terms of morality, and the United States also has the obligation to continue to assist China in terms of morality.

The Father of the Nation's industrial plan is based on the principle of joint efforts by all countries to develop China's resources. As long as we use foreign capital and technology properly, China's nation-building work can be shortened by many years. Therefore, as long as it is loans and assistance that do not interfere in China's internal affairs and do not harm China's sovereignty, we should welcome them as much as possible.

### Negotiated Prices for Economical Banquets: Chinese Food Limited to a Maximum of $200,000 Per Table; All Restaurants in the City to Comply Starting Tomorrow

[Report from this newspaper] The authorities have decided to implement economical banquets from the 20th of this month. Yesterday, the Chinese and Western restaurant industry associations submitted the price list for economical banquets to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval: Western food: one dish and one soup, type A: $120,000 per person; type B: $100,000 per person; simple meal: $80,000 per person for one dish and one soup. Chinese food: six dishes and one soup per table, ten people per table, type A: $1.2 million; type B: $1 million; type C: $800,000; type D: $600,000; simple meal: for gatherings of less than ten people, one dish per person is the standard, with a maximum limit of six dishes and one soup. The total price must not exceed the standard of the limited price for banquets. Set meal: one dish and one soup, type A: $20,000 per person; type B: $15,000; type C: $12,000. The above prices are the maximum prices, and restaurants may reduce them in order depending on their business conditions. Foreign wine and food items banned by the government are not allowed to be used in meals.

The Restaurant Industry Association has also drafted several industry covenants: In addition to the above regulations, all industry members must strictly abide by them. It is also stipulated that members must not pay for the meals of customers' drivers and coachmen. All members should add economical snack sections, providing set meals of one dish and one soup. According to Bureau Chief Wu, no noble restaurants in this city, such as the Ti Ze Lou of the International Hotel and the Jinmen Restaurant, may violate these economical regulations, otherwise they may be closed down.

### Soaring Fuel Prices for Transportation Ships Force Half to Suspend Operations; Transportation Industry Sends Representatives to Nanjing for Consultation

[Report from this newspaper] The National Transportation Ship Industry Association and the Shanghai Transportation Ship Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday. During the meeting, Director Xu Xueyu reported on the disposal of ships after receiving a telegram from the Ministry of Communications to end the General Administration of Water Transportation Brigade. Yang Guanbei and Wei Wenhan were immediately appointed to handle the matter with the General Administration. Next, the discussion focused on the soaring fuel prices, which have accounted for more than 80% of the cost. All expenses for new construction, repairs, and materials cannot be maintained. Half of the transportation ships will be forced to suspend operations. The oil prices adjusted by the Shanghai Petroleum Company on the 7th of this month are far higher than the international allocation price, which is also unreasonable. In order to save the current crisis in the shipping industry, the government should allow official exchange rates for fuel oil for ships, exempt tariffs and additional taxes, and should have representatives from the transportation ship industry participate in the review and discussion when oil companies adjust oil prices. Li Lingliang, Cheng Yuqi, Wei Wenhan, Shi Fuchang, and other four representatives were elected to negotiate with the government. The four representatives went to Nanjing last night.

### The Cathay Yue Opera Theatre Evades Taxes; The Financial Bureau Investigates and Requests Punishment

[Report from this newspaper] After Yue Opera star Xiao Dangui committed suicide, people generally believed that it was due to the abuse she suffered from her husband Zhang Chunfan, and Zhang Chunfan became the target of public criticism. To make matters worse, someone secretly informed the Financial Bureau that Zhang's Cathay Yue Opera Theatre was falsely reporting entertainment taxes. The number of programs sold each day was greater than the number of tickets sold, which proves that he was underreporting in order to evade taxes. After investigation, the Financial Bureau found that the theatre had evaded a total of $554,400 in taxes, and reported it to the District Court for punishment.

### Three Tenants Should be Summoned to Testify in the Huang Bohui Shooting Case

[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Desheng, who is suspected of masterminding the shooting of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shishi Bao, in February, was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for attempted murder. Judge Zeng Jingzhong had already opened a court session once to interrogate him. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong opened the second court session to summon witnesses. First, Zheng's daughter, Zheng Jingyan, was summoned and asked how many people were at home and whether she knew the names of the Western gunmen on the night the plaintiff was shot. She replied that on that night, in addition to herself, there were her mother and a younger brother, totaling three people at home. As for the names of the Western gunmen, she did not know. The court then asked whether the high-quality cigars found on the table when the police went to her house to investigate after the incident were used to entertain Westerners. She replied that they were her father's. Then, witnesses Zhang Jingchang, Xu Wenhua, Chen Yonglu, and other tenants were summoned and interrogated one by one. The three people provided detailed information about the situation at the time, saying that they knew that two Westerners used guns to shoot. Then, Zheng Desheng was interrogated, and his confession was still full of sophistry. Finally, according to Huang Bohui's statement, the court stated the process of Zheng's attempt to seize the ownership of his Shishi Bao building, roughly saying that Zheng Desheng served as the rental agent from 1944 to September last year. After checking the accounts, he found that Zheng had collected more than 20 million yuan in rent, while only more than 3 million yuan was given to him. At the same time, he also leased empty houses without authorization, receiving a huge amount of transfer fees, and privately sold glass and other items. His intention to seize ownership was obvious. Because he was eager to recover the ownership, he caused a grudge, so he was undoubtedly instigated by Zheng to be shot, and so on. The court ordered Zheng Desheng to be detained and rescheduled for interrogation.

According to Wang's statement, he did not know who signed the delivery order, only that Sakhola, an employee of Texaco, told him that it was Major Piers who sold them. Wang also said: "I once met with Major Piers, and he told me that he wanted to sell the oil barrels." The defense lawyer then asked Wang: "Did Major Piers directly tell you?" Wang replied: "When I spoke with Major Piers, Sakhola acted as the translator." The court was adjourned, and after a lunch break, the interrogation will continue next week.

### A False Alarm of Power Outage in the Former French Concession; A Thunderous Sound Plunges the Area into Darkness

[Report from this newspaper] The power supply area of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, including the entire area of the former French Concession, suddenly lost power at 9:30 last night, plunging the area into darkness. Military communications were also affected and temporarily suspended. After 10:00, power gradually resumed. According to the Water and Electricity Company, the power outage was caused by the sudden damage to two engines last night, and the main line was also burned out. After inspection, the cause of the engine damage was believed to be related to excessive electricity consumption. According to residents near the plant who witnessed the incident, they initially saw a huge flame coming out of the chimney, followed by a thunderous sound, and then the entire area of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company went dark. At that time, it was impossible to see one's fingers, and traffic and pedestrians on the road were all panicked.

### Li Guangzhi Denies Taking Bribes in the Smuggling Case on the Meiqi Ship; Asks for Justice; Trial Concluded and Awaiting Judgment

[Report from this newspaper] In the case of smuggling found in the luggage on the General Meiqi, a customs inspector named Li Guangzhi was accused of corruption. The District Court has tried the case several times and concluded the trial yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 2:25 a.m. yesterday. Li Guangzhi stated yesterday: The transcript at the customs was written by Sun Kedong and not by himself. After the General Meiqi arrived at the port on August 9, he exchanged a few words with Sun at the exit, but he had never met Sun before. He flatly denied taking bribes, saying that he was only responsible for inspecting goods and not luggage. He did not help in the luggage class that day. He was accused this time entirely because he was not good at flattering his superiors. He asked the court to seek justice for him. Witness Sun Baochang stated: He was the director of the luggage class at the time, and Li Guangzhi was not a member of the luggage class and was not assigned to help on August 9. According to Sun, such an incident was impossible. Li's defense lawyer, Mr. Huan Shichang, stated that the customs inspection matters were divided into two parts, one for the luggage class and the other for the inspection class. The powers of the two were clearly defined and could not be usurped. Since Li Guangzhi was an inspector, how could he be involved in inspecting luggage? The court ordered the debate on the case to be concluded and set a date for judgment.

### Six Major Public Utilities Associations Organize Labor Welfare Matters

(Our News) The responsible parties from the six major public utilities in this city – the American power company, the British tram company, the French water and electricity company, the American telephone company, the British water company, and the British gas company – visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to discuss labor welfare matters. Representatives of the six companies generally agreed in principle to the establishment of labor hospitals, labor children's schools, and cooperatives, but there were many technical difficulties. Hospitals and schools cannot be built overnight, so the plan is for the six companies to jointly establish a labor hospital first, and then gradually increase the number. At the same time, the responsible parties of each company took the opportunity to ask Director Wu to convey to the competent authorities the current situation where the income and expenditure of each company cannot be balanced, hoping that the adjustment of water, electricity, telephone, and tram prices can be approved as soon as possible to provide financial support.

### Central Government Principally Agrees to Public Utility Price Increase

(Our News) The issue of adjusting the prices of public utilities in this city, such as electricity, gas, telephone, tram, public bus, ferry, and small train, is expected to be decided on the 20th. The central government has expressed its principal agreement to the price adjustment calculation table proposed by the municipal government via long-distance telephone, but no formal order has arrived yet. The crux of the problem lies in the ad valorem issue of fuel import tariffs. The municipal government requests that it be levied based on the company's contract price. President Zhang of the National Bank has also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for discussion, but the Ministry of Finance has expressed its unwillingness to accept this. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, will visit Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, today to discuss this. Regardless of whether the negotiation results in levying tariffs based on the company's contract price or the market price, the authorities will have a decisive statement on the price adjustment of public utilities in this city on the 20th.

### Chairman Commends Economic Police Chief Yu; Director Visits Nanking and Returns to Shanghai – Reported on Student Strikes, Commodity Prices, etc.

(Our News) Police Chief Yu Shuping recently went to Nanking. In addition to reporting to the central government on the handling of labor strikes and the stabilization of commodity price inflation in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau, he also requested instructions from the Ministry of Interior on expanding the police bureau's staffing and personnel issues, with the main focus on the placement of transferred military officers. Furthermore, emphasizing that the city's public security forces urgently need to be strengthened, he consulted with the Ministry of National Defense on issuing additional weapons and ammunition and requested an increase of 40 armored vehicles to strengthen the city's defense capabilities. Having completed his official duties, he returned to Shanghai early yesterday morning. In the afternoon, he met with reporters at the police bureau and said: "During this trip to Nanking, I met with Chairman Chiang, President Zhang, Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Interior, and Director Tang of the Police Administration, among others. On the morning of the 16th, I was personally summoned by Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang was very concerned about the situation in Shanghai. The first thing he asked about was the life and discipline of the Shanghai police and whether there was any corruption or malfeasance. I immediately replied that the vast majority of police officers and policemen are able to maintain their integrity and abide by the law. In particular, some of the current Shanghai police officers were left over from the former Shanghai Municipal Council and have served for one or two decades. They are all excellent individuals, and most of their families have side businesses, the sum of which is enough to keep their families warm and fed. Another part was recruited and hired after the victory. Most are young people who have not yet started families and have no family burdens, so although their income is meager, it is enough to support themselves. At the same time, the police bureau is making great efforts to promote welfare undertakings and has now established police apartments and dormitories, public canteens, police children's schools, and police mutual aid cooperatives, etc., so it can cultivate a clean and honest atmosphere. Then he inquired about the city's labor strikes and commodity price fluctuations. I reported in detail, roughly as follows:

The labor strike was caused by the discovery of a batch of bandit party lists during the search of the Futong Printing House, including workers from the American-owned Shanghai Power Company. After the arrest, a go-slow occurred. It was resolved after consultation with the Social Affairs Bureau. At that time, workers from the French tram company suddenly responded, making unreasonable demands and going on strike. At that time, the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to maintain urban traffic, hired new workers to continue driving under police protection. Who knew that troublemakers would take this opportunity to incite workers to destroy military vehicles, resulting in the arrest of 96 workers. Except for those found to have evidence of sabotage who were transferred to the court for interrogation, the rest were released on bail by the union and the company authorities, and the labor strike was quickly quelled." Chairman Chiang instructed: "In the future, attention should be paid to troublemakers, and they must not be allowed to stay in Shanghai." Director Yu also reported that the reason for the recent commodity price fluctuations in this city was actually due to repeated adjustments in foreign exchange and cotton yarn prices by the Textile Control Commission. Furthermore, due to factory power restrictions, output decreased, while production costs increased, resulting in an excess of demand over supply, coupled with pre-seasonal speculation, which caused commodity prices to soar to unprecedented levels. After the Economic Inspection Committee, chaired by Mayor Wu, decided to take strict measures and dispatched all economic police to monitor various markets, commodity prices generally fell. The Chairman was pleased to hear this. He immediately ordered more people to be added to the economic police and that the organizational methods of the economic police be submitted for review. At that time, it happened that grain merchants in this city sent representatives to Nanking to petition against the collection of grain business tax. The Chairman, concerned about the people's food supply, continued to inquire about this matter. I reported that the main reasons for the rising grain prices were that the sources were not smooth and that some factories and schools were hoarding rice. At the same time, there were many procedures from transporting rice from the production area to the consumers. That is, from the purchase in the production area to the rice milling plant, and then through the transportation company, the market broker, the grain wholesaler, to the rice store, and then to the consumers, the tax paid for each dan (unit of weight) of rice amounted to 100,000 yuan, so the rice price also rose invisibly as a result. After listening to the report, the Chairman paid close attention to it and agreed to have the food and finance departments reconsider it. As for the

Regarding the Jindu incident, Yu met with Vice Minister Qin of the Ministry of National Defense in Nanking. Qin said: "The military police part of this case has already been judged. The police part will be transferred to Shanghai for trial by the court and announced at the same time as the military police part." Finally, Yu told reporters that he had planned to expand the economic police to 100 people and make them independent. At the same time, he ordered all branch bureaus to pay attention to the reporting of economic criminals in the future. Qianghua White Paper was sealed up.

### Ordered Zhan Peilin to Persuade and Suppress Paper Prices; Qianghua White Paper Was Sealed Up

(Our News) The Qianghua Paper Company at No. 51 Zijin Road was suspected of hoarding. Yesterday, the Economic Section of the Police Bureau seized a total of 267 rolls of white paper and 1,384 reams of cut paper. Xu Zhenyu, the person in charge of the company, was taken to the bureau for interrogation, and all the white paper was seized. In addition, yesterday morning, the section summoned Zhan Peilin, the chairman of the paper industry association, to the bureau to persuade him, hoping that the industry would automatically suppress paper prices. According to Zhan, the current market price has fallen from 1.2 million yuan per ream to 700,000 yuan.

In addition, as a result of the police bureau's economic section and the Textile Control Commission's spot checks on various yarn factories in recent days, they are being reviewed together with Tan Yili, the leader of the yarn and cloth group of the Economic Inspection Committee. It is reported that the yarn allocation account books of the Guangdong Yarn Factory at No. 410 Mabailu showed that Wanfu, Chengzi, and Sanxin three households had been allocated a large amount of cotton yarn. The persons in charge of each household have been summoned by the group.

### Three Economic Committee Members Visit Garrison Headquarters

The three members of the National Economic Commission, Shi Kuiling, Huang Yuanbin, and Liu Zhendong, who were ordered to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the city's commodity price turmoil, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after reporting their duties in Nanking and started their investigation work again. At 4:00 p.m., they visited the Garrison Headquarters and were received by Li Zheng, the chief secretary of the headquarters, and Zhang Bingmin, the chief of the Economic Section. The three members inquired in detail about the Garrison Headquarters' recent price control policies and future plans.

(Our News) The 12th Economic Inspection Committee meeting of this city was held yesterday in the municipal government conference room. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting. Shi Kuiling, a member of the National Economic Commission who was again dispatched to Shanghai to investigate the cause of commodity price fluctuations, also attended the meeting and said in his speech that he was currently collecting various data and would prepare a report and recommendations to be submitted to the National Economic Commission for review. Subsequently, the persons in charge of the gold and silver group, etc., reported on the inspection work of their respective groups in the past week, and then began to discuss the cases: The Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association and other nine organizations presented a report stating that the temporary registration method for cloth inventory has many difficulties in the replication industry, and sincerely stated their opinions, requesting adoption, etc. It was decided that the cloth registration for the replication industry should be completed on schedule. The investigation of the factory accounts from July to September should still be carried out. Raw materials in stock exceeding three months for the replicated industry will be considered hoarding. The limit for other industries is still one and a half months. This time, the hoarding and speculation of cloth must be thoroughly investigated and strictly handled step by step. It is strictly forbidden to ship edible oil to Japan. The municipal government has received a reply from the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance and has ordered the Ou and Zheng Customs to handle it accordingly. Regarding the reward for reporting black market gold and silver secretly, the central government has temporarily approved the cancellation of restrictions and will reward it at 30% across the board.

### Pan Xulun's Nephew Suffers Remorse; Abandoned Fiancee Accuses, Eligible for Amnesty Order for Exemption from Prosecution

(Our News) Pan Jiuru, Pan Xulun's nephew, had a relationship with his fiancée, Shao Weirong, last year in September, and then abandoned Shao. He married a woman surnamed Gu in Shanghai on July 4th this year. Shao sued him for violating public morals. Yesterday morning, the case was heard in the Criminal Court No. 3 of the District Court by Judge Ye. Shao Zairong said that she was engaged to the defendant in 1945. On September 21st last year, she was induced by him to have a secret meeting in Wuxi. On October 13th, she continued once. Later, he lied that he was in financial straits and could not get married. Unexpectedly, he married Miss Gu. He actually committed the crime of defrauding marriage. She asked the court to punish him according to the law. Pan Jiuru confessed that he was engaged to the plaintiff on November 8th the year before last, but because he found her temperament strange, he entrusted a matchmaker to return the love letters written by Shao before May this year, declaring the termination of the engagement. He frankly admitted to having a relationship with her. Judge Ye persuaded the two to reconcile and live together, but Shao did not speak. Pan said, "This is not possible. It is not that I don't want her, but her behavior and temper are really bad. My conscience feels sorry for her." The court ruled that Pan Jiuru's criminal behavior occurred before the announcement of the Amnesty Order, and the court immediately declared in accordance with the law that "Pan Jiuru is exempt from prosecution, and the civil compensation fees will be handled separately by the Immigration Court."

### Gold Focus Autumn Scenery

[Our Zhenjiang, 17th dispatch] The remnants of the communist bandits in northern Jiangsu, recently coordinating with Liu Bocheng's bandit troops who have been causing disturbances in the border areas of Jiangsu and Anhui, stirred up trouble at the end of September in Funing, Yancheng, Shiying, and Xinghua, all within the Huaihai Pacification Zone, as well as in Taixing, Taixian, and Jingjiang counties, within the First Pacification Zone. The garrison troops, in order to take the initiative and strike the communist bandits, withdrew all government agencies and civil servants from the county towns at the beginning of this month, retreating with the army into the territories of Dongtai, Xinghua, and Taixian counties, numbering over 40,000 people. Most of these refugees are poor and miserable. Fleeing their homes, their needs for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation have become major problems, causing them to wander and suffer. They earnestly hope that the government will learn from past mistakes, promptly devise effective measures, deploy large armies, eliminate the remaining communist bandits in northern Jiangsu, and thoroughly destroy the communist bandits' local organizations in the various counties of northern Jiangsu, in order to ensure the people's livelihood. It is reported that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has expressed great concern for the people of northern Jiangsu and may come to Zhenjiang for inspection this autumn and winter.

A person from Xinghua said: A certain brigade of the National Army's Liu's unit, which reinforced the county, has already entered the county territory. The government-controlled areas and both urban and rural areas are gradually becoming more stable. However, due to the influx of refugees, prices are soaring, and people's lives are quite difficult. Therefore, many have recently been leaving the area in groups to seek a living in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is reported that the Changzhou authorities, recognizing the importance of water defenses due to Xinghua's surrounding waterways and numerous harbors, and given its proximity to Ji Jian and complex terrain, plan to dispatch more new-type small gunboats to the county to assist the National Army in strengthening water security. In addition, Bu Zhenhai, the county magistrate of Xinghua, accompanied Zhang Guanqiu, the county magistrate of Gaoyou, to Huaiyin last week to present a flag and pay respects to General Zhang Xuezhong. Zhang Xuezhong inquired in detail about the public security of the county.

Defenses are being actively strengthened at various strongholds along the canal in Baoying and Gaoyou. In the villages of Dongtai and Xinghua, due to the military campaigns to suppress the rebellion, the people are burdened with heavy taxes.

After the autumn harvest, many farmers are crying out in hunger and cold, a testament to their suffering. The Executive Yuan has only allocated 300 million yuan to meet the needs of refugees in Jiancheng, Xinghua, Dongtai, Haimen, and Qidong counties. Among them, Yancheng received 100 million yuan, and the other four counties received 50 million yuan each. Although this is a drop in the bucket, given the government's tight finances, this relief fund demonstrates the government's concern for the people of northern Jiangsu. However, educators and intellectuals in various counties of northern Jiangsu hope that the central government will

quickly establish a fundamental plan for pacifying northern Jiangsu. On October 8, National Assembly representatives Li Hongru, Dai Tianqiu, Bao Mingshu, and Cui Xichen, from northern Jiangsu, repeatedly appealed to the press in Zhenjiang, emphasizing that "without northern Jiangsu, there is no Guozhen," highlighting the importance of the northern Jiangsu issue.

In northern Jiangsu, on one hand, there are natural disasters and banditry, and on the other hand, there are fat crabs and yellow chrysanthemums. At this time, the scenery of the Three Mountains of Jinjiao and Beigu, famous throughout the country, is particularly lovely. Over the past week, tourists from Nanjing and Shanghai have arrived in droves, with a particularly large number of visitors to Jiaoshan. The usually desolate Zhenjiang market is also showing some signs of life. However, at Zhenjiang Station, there is another picture, a stark contrast. Tourists arriving from Nanjing and Shanghai are resplendent, well-dressed, and like gods, while refugees fleeing to Nanjing and Shanghai are mostly emaciated and ragged, like beggars. With different circumstances, it is no wonder that after the tourists' sightseeing is over, they use the relatively lower prices in Zhenjiang

as a topic of conversation, while the miserable refugees complain that the prices for military tickets from Nanjing to Zhenjiang and Shanghai are the same, which is unfair. Why not consider the poor? (The ticket prices set by the railway bureau are the same from Nanjing to Zhenjiang and Shanghai, and passengers often complain.)

Grain prices and general commodity prices in Zhenjiang have also fluctuated sharply recently. Top-quality rice has exceeded 600,000 yuan per stone, and fuel and oil prices have more than doubled compared to before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Civil servants and ordinary people are all complaining bitterly. Citizens are surprised that while there is a severe housing shortage and difficult living conditions, the authorities are still focusing on superficial construction by demolishing houses and expanding roads.

Councilors of Zhenjiang County and representatives from various districts and townships gathered on the 10th. They jointly elected Chen Guangfu, from the Shanghai financial community, as a

candidate for the Legislative Yuan representing the First District of Zhenjiang County. Bu Yulin, a senior figure in the Zhenjiang press who was originally running for the Legislative Yuan in the First District, has, in accordance with the principle of the party member yielding to a more capable candidate, published a statement withdrawing from the election. Bu Yulin's election had been quite promising, and now his yielding to Chen is widely praised. In addition, Tao Yihu, a councilor of Zhenjiang County, recently proposed to rectify the Zhenjiang conscription administration and investigate the accounts of settlement fees, which has attracted much attention. It is reported that the Changzhou authorities have begun to investigate.

The list of committee members for the election offices in various districts, counties, and cities of Jiangsu Province has been approved, including 40 people such as Lin Xuyi for district election offices and 314 people such as Huang Xiangchen for county and city election offices. Among the members of the district, county, and city election committees, members of the Min, She, and Youth parties each account for 70 people. It is expected that under the enlightened decision-making of the government, the electoral administration in this province will proceed smoothly. (Special correspondent Chen Fang Canglang)

### Thorough Review of Sino-American Relations (Continued from Page 3) Cheng Tianfang

Mr. Pugh suggested that the United States should loan China 1.35 billion U.S. dollars within three years. Among them, 600 million U.S. dollars would be a credit loan for China to purchase food, raw materials, machinery, etc. from the United States; 150 million U.S. dollars would be used as a foreign exchange stabilization fund; and 600 million U.S. dollars would be used for military aid to China to help China suppress the communist bandits. We highly agree with Mr. Pugh's principle; it's just that the foreign exchange stabilization fund of 150 million is really felt to be insufficient. I personally believe that the most needed thing for China right now is to reform the monetary system - issuing new currency to replace the legal currency that has reached the stage of malignant inflation. If the monetary system is not changed, inflation cannot be curbed, budgets cannot be balanced, prices will continue to rise, the living standards of civil servants and teachers cannot be guaranteed, the social economy will never be stable, and all construction will be impossible to carry out. Therefore, in addition to the work of suppressing bandits, the most urgent thing at present is this. However, to issue a new currency, there must be sufficient foreign exchange reserves. Without reserves, the new currency can be devalued again the evening after it is issued in the morning, and the result will inevitably follow the path of malignant inflation. If there are reserves, the new currency can freely purchase foreign exchange, the black market will immediately disappear, and prices will tend to stabilize. Then the government can talk about balancing revenue and expenditure, increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and the financial situation can get on track, the national economy can be stable and developed, the living standards of civil servants and teachers can be reasonably resolved, administrative efficiency can be improved, and corruption can be eliminated. How much foreign exchange reserve is needed? Of course, the more the better, but at a minimum, I estimate that 1 billion U.S. dollars is needed. This is the key to the United States assisting China in political and economic reform. If you do not pay attention to this basic plan, small piecemeal loans are likely to be of no avail. Moreover, this loan, plus the other two loans proposed by Mr. Pugh, totals 2.2 billion. It looks like a large sum, but compared with the loan that the United States gave to the United Kingdom last year, it is less than 60%; compared with the funds needed for the Marshall Plan for European aid, it is even smaller. As for the various military, political, and economic reforms suggested by Mr. Pugh, I believe they are all worthy of the government's attention and adoption. However, the United States should not use these as exchange conditions for loans. Because it is one thing for the Chinese government to reform automatically, and another thing to implement reforms under the intervention of foreign countries. The former is welcomed by the people of the whole country, while the latter will inevitably arouse resentment from many people, because it damages the self-esteem of the Chinese nation, and it can also be used by the Communist Party to create discord in Sino-American friendship.

Will Mr. Pugh's proposal be adopted by the U.S. government? This is a question that many Chinese are thinking about. In my opinion, since Marshall returned to the United States, the U.S. attitude towards China has been wavering under a contradictory mentality. Unless this contradictory mentality is broken, it will be difficult for the U.S. policy towards China to be very clear. During the war of resistance, the U.S. government was influenced by the propaganda of the Communist Party and believed that the Chinese government was a one-party dictatorship and not democratic enough; therefore, on December 15, 1945, President Truman issued a declaration on China policy, stating that the Chinese government must expand its base and accommodate other parties to participate. Only after this point is completed can the United States provide further economic assistance. At the same time, he sent Marshall to China to mediate the disputes between the government and the Chinese Communist Party. Marshall's arrival in China was indeed with full enthusiasm, hoping that China could avoid the pain of civil war and achieve peaceful unification. Therefore, last summer, he braved the heat and went to Mount Lu eight times to convey conditions to the government and the Chinese Communist Party. The American officers under him also did not hesitate to take risks and carried out the task of mediation on the front lines. However, he did not understand the Chinese Communist Party's attempt to overthrow the government at that time, and did not realize that asking the Chinese Communist Party to abandon armed force and engage in peaceful political activities was like seeking skin from a tiger. As a result, Marshall and the American officers worked hard but to no avail, and after thirteen months of efforts, they finally failed and left. Because the Chinese Communist Party did not join the government, which is equivalent to the conditions in Truman's declaration not being met, the United States has not provided economic assistance to China in the past year and a half, except for relief goods and the transfer of surplus materials. Not only were there no new loans, but even the 500 million U.S. dollars that had been designated for aid to China were frozen in the Export-Import Bank and could not be used, and it expired at the end of June this year.

This is the factual course of events in the United States' policy towards China in the past one year and ten months, but on the other hand, the U.S. government's understanding of the Communist Party has undergone a significant change. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. government has followed the policy left by Roosevelt, hoping that communist countries can cooperate effectively with democratic countries. Later, the concept gradually changed, and today this hope can be said to have disappeared long ago. Although Marshall's mediation in China failed, it had one gain, which was to recognize the true face of the Chinese Communist Party, which is not a moderate rural reform faction. The Soviet Union's various actions in Eastern Europe have made the U.S. government deeply aware of the Soviet Union's national policy. Therefore, on March 12 this year, President Truman delivered a speech in Congress, requesting 350 million U.S. dollars to aid Greece and resist communist aggression (the so-called Truman Doctrine). In June this year, Marshall announced a policy to aid the entire Europe (the so-called Marshall Plan). When these two things happened, some people in the United States (including members of Congress) said, "We are trying our best to resist the development of communism in Europe, but in Asia, we want the Communist Party to join the government before we are willing to lend money to China. Isn't this extremely ridiculous?" Although Truman and Marshall have not publicly expressed their opinions on this point, I think they must be laughing secretly. Therefore, on the one hand, the U.S. government must continue to aid the Chinese government in accordance with its overall national policy, but on the other hand, with Truman's statement and the failure of Marshall's mediation, it cannot turn around for a while. Moreover, influenced by Communist propaganda, it believes that China is not democratic, not free, its politics are corrupt, and its officials are corrupt, and it feels that such a government is not worthy of assistance. This is the contradictory mentality of the U.S. government. Because of this mentality, coupled with the fact that the U.S. government has always placed Europe first and Asia second, and the European problem is also very serious, the Chinese problem has been temporarily neglected. Therefore, the U.S. government's performance on China policy in the past ten months has been to hesitate and be indecisive.

However, this situation cannot last long. The international situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the confrontation between communism and democracy is becoming more profound because the signboard of the Communist International has been rehung. In order to seek world peace and stability and to implement its established national policy, the U.S. government will inevitably continue the policy of aiding China during the war of resistance. Weidmaier's report has not been published to this day, and everyone thinks it is a mystery. According to my speculation, the content of the report must be to advocate conditional assistance to the Chinese government. Mr. Pugh's article may not directly influence the U.S. government, but it can clarify the American people's understanding of the Chinese Communist Party and their views on the China issue, and can promote American public opinion to support the U.S. government's active China policy. In this sense, Mr. Pugh's article is very useful. (After Marshall returned to the United States from Moscow, he personally told a Chinese diplomat that there was no question of the United States continuing to aid China, but there must be a reason or a way to get the support of public opinion and the consent of Congress.) From the standpoint of China, what we hope is that the U.S. government's aid must not be attached with conditions that China cannot accept, so that the good intentions of the United States will be in vain. At the same time, we hope that the U.S. government will understand the seriousness of the situation in East Asia, which is no less than that in Europe, and will not neglect Asia because of Europe. The aid to China should not be too small, and even more should not be too late, so as to reduce or eliminate its effect. (The End) But Allow Collection of Additional and Special Taxes

### The Import and Export Control Commission Has Drafted Handling Procedures for Goods Imported Without Permits; Provisions Will Be Published After Organization

(Our Newspaper) The Import and Export Control Commission held a routine meeting yesterday afternoon starting at 4:00 PM. Chen Qitian, Li Fuson, Li Gan, Yang Heng, Shen Zouting, Huang Qinghua, Zhang Zikai, Zhang Fuyun, and Fang Zhixian attended, presided over by Chairman Zhang Jia'ao. The meeting concluded at 7:30 PM. After the meeting, according to Fang Zhixian, Director of the Secretariat of the Commission, there were three important motions at this meeting, which are recorded as follows:

Handling procedures for goods arriving at port and shipped without permits have generally been drafted. However, the wording of each article still needs to be organized and is expected to be published on the 20th. It has been resolved to allow supplementary registration for privately owned foreign exchange goods that arrived at port or were shipped before August 16th and failed to be registered as scheduled according to Announcement No. 2. In order to support industry and commerce and encourage exports, the Transport Management Department is discussing measures for the import of raw materials for export products. The draft of the measures was discussed today (the 18th) and passed in principle. The detailed provisions will be revised and organized before being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation.

As for the detailed rules for the implementation of the handling of goods arriving at the port with privately owned foreign exchange, the commission will need to consider the original intention of the measures, take into account factual needs, and formulate them separately so that the handling measures can be promoted and utilized to the fullest extent.

In addition, the eight points of opinion suggested to the commission by the sixteen public associations of import and export industries in this city were also discussed at the meeting, and the attending members expressed sympathy. It is planned to consider them temporarily without making any decisions.

The commission originally intended to publish the handling measures promulgated by the Executive Yuan in the newspaper today, and after the announcement, handle the registration and application matters of import merchants. Later, because various procedures were not yet complete, the announcement will likely be delayed until the 21st. The detailed text of the announcement is the same as the "Handling Measures for Privately Owned Foreign Exchange Goods Arriving and Shipped Without Permits" published in the first edition of this newspaper on the 15th of this month, so it will not be repeated here.

### Import and Export Industry Association Holds Extraordinary Meeting

(Our Newspaper) The import and export industry association of this city held an extraordinary membership meeting yesterday afternoon. The secretary general of the association, Zhang Yaocao, reported on the meeting with Chairman Zhang and Vice Chairman Li of the Transport Management Committee yesterday (the 18th), stating that the eight suggestions made would generally be considered by the Transport Management Committee. However, the two points of using foreign exchange deposit certificates to offset the quota limits for the fourth and fifth quarters, and selling them to the original import merchants at the original purchase price plus 10% profit after government purchase, could not be readily accepted. The members immediately began to discuss, believing that if the Transport Management Committee could not accept all eight suggestions, the import merchants could only prepare to ship the original goods out of the country, and it was planned that the association would start registration on the 20th in order to facilitate securing shipping space for export.

### Government Bonds Continue to Weaken, Foreign Stocks Mediocre

### Draft Commercial Registration Law

The current Commercial Registration Law was promulgated on June 28th, 1937. It has been in effect for a long time and is no longer entirely suitable for the current situation.

Spring and Autumn

### Miscellaneous Notes on Novels

— Feng Ren

### Investiture of the Gods

"Full of absurd words," is of course the nature of novelists, but even works like "Investiture of the Gods" are not entirely without basis. The "Old Book of Tang," Ritual and Music section, records the Six Strategies: "When King Wu attacked Zhou, the snow was more than ten feet deep, and the five armies and two horses left no tracks. They came to the camp seeking an audience, and King Wu was surprised and asked why. Grand Duke replied: 'These must be the gods of the five directions coming to receive orders.' So he summoned them by their names and appointed them to their respective duties." In this case, the five armies and two horses are the gods of the four seas, Zhurong, Goumang, Zhuanxu, Rushou, Hebo, Fengbo, and Yushi. Also, the "Records of the Grand Historian," Fengshan section, states, "The eight gods were created from the time of Grand Duke." Therefore, popular tradition is not entirely false. "Gui Tian Suo Ji" records Dai Lin's words: "In the past, a local man used all his savings to marry off his eldest daughter. His younger daughter was resentful, and the local man comforted her, saying, 'Don't worry about poverty, but because of the Shangshu Wu Cheng chapter's phrase "Only you have gods, may you assist me," it was developed into the Investiture of the Gods, and the manuscript was given to the daughter. Later, her husband printed it, and it made a great profit.'" Examining the Zhou Shu Ke Yin chapter: "King Wu then conquered the four directions, totaling ninety-nine states, and captured one hundred and seven thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine demons, and three hundred million people." Demons and people are mentioned separately. Although it is not known what the so-called demons are, it is enough to prove the basis of the novel. Guangchengzi is seen in "Zhuangzi," Chi Jingzi is seen in the "Hanshu" Biography of Li Xun, and the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King is seen in the "Yuan History" Records of Clothing. Nezha is seen in "Sujian Zhi." The saying that the Second Master of Zhuokou is Yang Jian is not without basis.

### Romance of the Sui and Tang Dynasties

As for the "Romance of the Sui and Tang Dynasties," the imperial palace affairs of the Sui Yang Emperor and the Tang Ming Emperor are very detailed, and all have some basis. Its earthwork projects, the imperial chariot for women, the dwarf citizen Wang Yi, and Lady Hou's suicide poems are found in the "Mi Lou Ji." Its narrative of Yang Su's secret plots, the names of the sixteen courtyards of the Western Garden, the names of the beauties, boating in the North Sea encountering Chen Houzhu, the plum blossom jade lily blooming, Sima Kan forcing the emperor, and Zhu Gui'er's martyrdom are also found in the "Hai Shan Ji." Its narrative of reading the Guangling map in the palace, Ma Shumo opening the river eating children, seeing Duke Xiang of Song at home, Di Quxie entering the cave, Huangfu Jun carrying a large rat destroying his feet, and women pulling dragon boats are also found in the "Kai He Ji." (All three records were written by Han Wei.) Its narrative of Tang palace affairs is gleaned from Liu Su's "Anecdotes of the Sui and Tang Dynasties," Cao Ye's "Biography of Mei Fei," Zheng Chuhui's "Miscellaneous Records of Emperor Ming," Liu Cheng's "Common Words," Zheng Qian's "Records of the Kai Tian Biography," Wang Renyu's "Events of the Kaiyuan and Tianbao Eras," and the anonymous "Records of the Great Tang Dynasty." It also refers to Li Deyu's hearing of the past from the old Liu clan, the "Outer Biography of Taizhen" by the palace musician Shi, and Chen Hong's "Biography of the Song of Everlasting Regret." It can be said that every word is derived from somewhere.

### Romance of the Three Kingdoms

The book "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is well known in every household. When Man Gui entered the pass, it was translated into Manchu and used as a military book. The death of Yuan Chonghuan was due to the use of Jiang Gan's stealing of books, which is naturally a bit funny. However, the history of the old era was originally the emperor's private record, so it is better to have novels and legends, which may reflect the truth to some extent. Wang Yuyang's "Xiang Zu Notes" also said: "Therefore, historical legends often preserve the integrity of the Three Dynasties, surpassing the filthy history written by the author many times. The predecessors said that children in the village listened to the stories of the Three Kingdoms, and frowned when they heard of Liu Bei's defeat, and jumped for joy when Cao Cao was defeated. This is what is meant by this. When propriety is lost, seek it in the fields, and the same is true of history."

### The Painting Reflects the Person

— Hong Weifa

This was last winter when I was working in Nanjing. At that time, the best way to recover from work fatigue was to drink with Mr. Fu Baoshi and watch him paint. When drinking, whether he treated others or others treated him, they did not compete with each other but enjoyed themselves to the fullest. When the wine was flowing and their ears were buzzing, they would spread out paper and paint. When they reached a point of understanding, they would clap and laugh together. Then they would ask for inscriptions and take away a painting. He would happily write and happily give them away. It turned out that drinking and painting were close to his nature and were a way to express himself.

I think Mr. Fu's paintings can be said to be "the painting reflects the person." He is bold and unrestrained, so his paintings reveal boldness. He is calm and indifferent, so his paintings also reveal a state of tranquility. He has many certificates, so his paintings also reveal a strong scholarly atmosphere. He liked Shi Tao and had a deep understanding of Shi Tao's paintings, but his own paintings did not imitate Shi Tao. His landscapes have artistic conception, not just shocking people with chaotic rocks and waves. His figures have charm, not just attracting people with their appearance and dress.

Looking at his landscapes, people often have the thought that the mountains are endless and the waters are endless. "Just in this mountain, the clouds are so deep that I don't know where," it seems that many of his landscapes can be inscribed with such phrases, and it is precisely because of this that they are worthy of savoring. Looking at his figures, people will also increase their sense of worldly dust, because the figures in the paintings are too charming. This charm cannot be fully explained by the words "beauty" and "grace." If the figures in the paintings were also just attracting people with their appearance and dress, how could they purify life? And how could they be called works of art?

In fact, this situation is due to Mr. Fu's character and learning. I believe that in China, scholars are the most noble, and only true scholars can use the atmosphere of books to drive away the skill of craftsmen and become noble calligraphers. If we treat Mr. Fu as a Chinese scholar and appreciate his paintings, it will be easier to know the nobility of his works.

### Love and Life

— Kuang Ying

### Love and Hate

There is a Hebrew story like this:

Once upon a time, there was a king who hated "love" the most. He used very strange methods to deal with young men and women who were in love: he locked a fierce tiger and a woman in love in two empty rooms; and ordered the man to rush into a room within three minutes after a command to determine his life and death. If he rushed into the room where the tiger was locked, he would be devoured. Otherwise, the king would witness their marriage. In this way, many comedies and tragedies were staged. Later, the king's only daughter fell in love with a knight in front of the palace. Naturally, there was no exception, but the king temporarily hesitated because he was afraid that his only daughter would encounter a terrible fate, so he allowed the knight to exchange her for the most beautiful woman in the country. So, the knight, hoping to have a happy family in the future and avoid the tiger's mouth, went to beg the king's only daughter at night to give him a temporary indication of a target. She agreed, but she couldn't sleep that night, her chest was woven with contradictions. When the time came, the king's only daughter finally had the heart to deliberately point in the wrong direction and let her lover be devoured by the tiger.

Human "hatred" always follows "love" closely. When love is deep, so is hate. But one day, when one knows that one cannot preserve his "love," even the most concerned person will heartlessly watch him be destroyed without giving him a shred of cherishment. But, for thousands of years, who has ever torn down the hypocrisy of love between men and women with the palm of a tiger? Everyone uses sweet words and gentle means as a cover to deceive people.

In the end, love has bitten the innocence of many people. I suddenly remembered a sentence: love is like watching a lively scene, the people inside want to squeeze out, and the people outside want to squeeze in.

### Quotations from Lu Xun

— A Shui

After I finish writing, I have to read it twice. If I feel it is awkward, I will add or delete a few words. I must make it easy to read. I don't often use newly created words and sentences that only I understand or that even I don't understand. (Today is the anniversary of the death of the old man Xun, so I am publishing a quote to mark the occasion. (Author)

### Viewing the Sea of Clouds at Qiyun Rock

— Xu Shiqi

Mount Qiyun is more than forty li from Xiuning County in southern Anhui Province, and is two hundred feet high. Yisu Palace was built in the Ming Dynasty. The Incense Burner Peak in the center is towering and independent, and the distant view of the sea of clouds is extremely spectacular. (Author's note)

"Mr. Mai is really versatile." Liang Qun did not forget that the other party was a woman, but because she kept saying "this humble person," she called her "Mr." to cater to her psychology. Moreover, it is now common for women to be called Mr.

"What are you talking about? It's just a matter of assembling... But this humble person has a request; don't call this humble person 'Mr. Mai'. If you don't dislike me, if you treat me as a friend, call me 'Old Mai' or 'Little Mai'. I'm thirty-one this year. If we become close friends in the future, if you're willing to call me 'Brother Sha', although I'm not worthy, I'd be really happy..." As he said this, his eyes narrowed again.

Yao Qun suddenly remembered something when she heard the last sentence and was shocked. Although she remained calm, her eyes instinctively searched his body, especially paying attention to his throat to see if there was an Adam's apple.

"Don't misunderstand, Miss Ji..." He had already guessed Yao Qun's intentions. "Although this humble person has some Jianghu accents and tones, I'm not so vulgar as to cross-dress and deceive a big girl... But I can't explain it clearly. Although this humble person is also a woman, I've been enchanted ever since I saw you at the station, it's simply..." He probably meant "simply a love at first sight."

"I'm sorry, Mr. Mai... I have something else to do, I have to hurry..." Saying this, she looked at her watch towards this demon material. Yao Qun felt extremely embarrassed because this guy's actions and words were too cheesy.

"Oh!" This guy seemed to wake up from a dream. While rubbing his puffy eyes, he stood up: "Look, what did I come here for? ... Didn't I want to cooperate with you? First, seven or eight Chinese secret work comrades were captured by the radio station and circled by the Military Police Department. I plan to rescue them. Second, there are many young people and students here, but they are not properly organized. If they can be given guidance and united, the power will be really great..."

"Ah, what are the difficulties?" Yao Qun could only ask like this, keeping a distance.

"You know, it's not difficult to rescue them. I am willing to be responsible and guarantee that they will not run away. But the difficult thing is that they have no contact with me and of course will not listen to me. As for the students and young people, there is no connection between us, and of course they have no faith in me. Without faith, how can we organize them?"

"What do you plan to do?" Yao Qun had to squeeze his words out.

"There is only one way - as I said just now, as long as you are willing to cooperate, all problems can be solved." His attitude seemed very sincere, and there was no hypocrisy at all.

There is the following paragraph in Japanese history:

Once, when that fierce and ambitious emperor was on patrol, he saw a beautiful washerwoman by the river. He said: "Wait, I'm going to take you to the palace." This incident seemed like the ultimate good fortune to the washerwoman. She dreamed every night, even laughing in her sleep. However, day after day, the sun flew over her head, and when the washerwoman's face was as old as a wax figure, she still stayed by the river every day. But by that time the emperor had forgotten his promise.

A person who waits with weary eyes for the illusory and intangible dawn often receives some beautiful deceptions. People tend to yearn for the beauty of reality more than the castles in the air of dreams. Therefore, they often forget their true real life. By the time they realize it, the pain of life is like a snake biting and consuming your soul.

So, I got an interpretation of "life": -

Everyone makes life into a beautiful circle and locks themselves in this cage. After that, everyone is impatient with the cage of life and wants to break it.

In this, many sorrows arise.

### Welcoming Mr. Chen Shuren's Painting Exhibition

— Xu Weinan

It is not easy to be able to exhaust the skills of painting. It is naturally more precious to have both skills and to display the noble character of a calligrapher, and Mr. Chen Shuren alone can have both. He is truly worthy of being a first-class master in the contemporary painting world!

Mr. Chen has been working hard to paint for fifty years, and his attention has never wavered from painting. His mind is broad and his vision is high, so he can absorb and integrate the theories of Chinese and foreign painting. Of course, his works, from a technical point of view, have reached a perfect state in terms of composition, coloring and brushwork. But what is even more precious is that Mr. Chen's own integrity, which everyone admires, can also be fully revealed in the paintings. His works not only please the eye with beautiful lines or bright colors, but also have a kind of immaculate and noble, majestic and tranquil, elegant and dignified emotion bursting out. For example, the luxuriant green bamboo, in Mr. Chen's pen, the green bamboo leaves and bamboo poles are of course moving, but what makes people even more surprised is that the spirit of the bamboo branches, unyielding and soaring straight into the sky, is also vividly revealed before our eyes. Another example is landscapes, which not only evoke a feeling of excitement with their winding peaks and roads, but also make people feel the painter's own nobility. Furthermore, in portraits, even if only a porter is depicted, the spirit of labor of our country, "What does the emperor's power have to do with me?", can also be skillfully conveyed. This is truly a good medicine for cleansing our spirits!

Mr. Chen's paintings are also his original creations, and even the insects, flowers and birds have their own unique realm, different from the ordinary. I have seen his paintings for twenty years, and I feel that the older he gets, the more spiritual his paintings become, and the more he can express his characteristics, which makes people deeply admire him! Starting from the 20th of this month, Mr. Chen will select 180 of his fine works and exhibit them at the Daxin Company. Shanghai has not seen Mr. Chen's paintings since the Anti-Japanese War and has been longing for them for a long time. I think his exhibition will definitely cause a great excitement in Shanghai!

### Ode to Nature

The setting sun crosses the western ridge, and the crowds look out and are quickly deserted; the pine moon gives birth to the coolness of the night, and the wind and spring fill the clear listening.

I would like to borrow Meng Haoran's verses to salute Ms. Jun Bi's works. She uses oil paints and watercolors, ink brushes, to write her unique style, extremely poetic paintings, light and elegant, leisurely and far-reaching. The Yellow Mountain's ancient pines and sea of clouds, the Lushan Mountain's flying waterfalls and clear streams, the waves scouring the sand of Beidaihe, the willows dancing in the spring breeze by the West Lake, the Zi Jin Mountain is majestic, the old country's palace walls are resplendent and golden, the purity of the snowy mountains of western Alps, and the splendor of the red mountains of Lousha, the calmness and enthusiasm of the colors complement each other. She is truly an ode to the beauty of nature, a poet of the times.

"Looking at the Reflection by the Stream" and "After Bath" and other large-scale works are her carefully structured oil paintings. "White Head" and "Childhood" and other portraits, she depicts the different processes of the era, which make people feel infinite emotion. Applying the subjects of Chinese paintings, conveying the spirit of oriental art, such as "Old Taoist", "Picking Plums", "Raising a Glass to Invite the Bright Moon", and "Song of the Homeless", are all wonders of the art world.

She is a talented writer, and at the age of thirteen, she studied in Paris, gathering the essence of Western art and expressing the feelings of Oriental nature. The rooster crows in the wind and rain, the autumn moon and spring flowers, the smoke and clouds in her chest and at her wrist. She has won international acclaim. The final success belongs to the greatest efforts. I would like to wish Ms. Jun this. (Tu Qi)

### Cartoon Hell

— Looking Through a Tube

The Buddha said: "If I don't go to hell, who will?" I think hell must be more comfortable than heaven. People are fond of novelty and dislike the old, it is human nature. If you are tired of living in heaven, you naturally want to go to hell. Dante also said; "All things are corruptible, only hell is incorruptible." Then the eternity of hell is actually surpasses heaven, because heaven is corruptible, and tragedy must follow bliss. This is a universal truth. People are willing to eat olives but not quinine, and the same principle applies. In the "Divine Comedy," we know that there are nine layers of hell. The upper four layers lead to the land of bliss, but the roads are mixed. The lower four layers lead to the "ruins of the flood." Entering this realm is called the second death. Even the soul is reduced. It neither increases nor decreases, is neither defiled nor pure. What could be more comfortable than this? Ascending to heaven and descending to hell is the tragedy of tragedies in the world.

Christians say that there is no hell in the "Bible," which is not very accurate. In the new Matthew chapter 25, on the day of the final judgment, there is "eternal fire." Is this so-called "fire" hell? But this is not the hell of damnation, but the hell of exaltation. Why? Because this is the ladder to heaven. A soul that can repent in hell can surely enter heaven.

"There is no way to ascend to heaven, and no door to enter hell." It can be seen that there is no significant difference between heaven and hell, because they are mentioned in the same breath. Everyone certainly loves heaven, but who doesn't love hell? Those who fear hell can never ascend to heaven. Once you enter heaven, can you not enter hell? "Blessed are those who can repent" - God originally opened the gates of heaven and hell at the same time!

### Advertising and Responsibility

— Zhu Mei

In recent years, advertising has been widely used in China, which shows that commerce is progressing. I think the function of advertising is to promote, and the purpose is to promote its products. The reason why a product needs to be promoted is that the product is new or because people don't know how to use it. Advertising promotion is sometimes inevitably a little exaggerated, but it cannot deviate too far from reality. This reality is the issue of being responsible to customers, because if something has no reality, it is described in such a way that people are fooled. This is nonsense and deception, and there is no responsibility to conscience or society. If we casually open a newspaper, whether it is a large or small newspaper, we often publish some irresponsible advertisements. These kinds of advertisements are especially numerous for medicines. Anyone with a little common sense knows that there is no specific effective drug for lung disease today, but the advertisements claim that there is a drug that specifically treats lung disease. Although there are now specific effective drugs for gonorrhea and syphilis, they cannot be cured in three or five months. Some advertisements claim that they can be cured in one day. This kind of deceptive advertisement can be found everywhere if you open a newspaper. I think that people who publish this kind of advertisement not only have no sense of responsibility, but also have no common sense. What is even stranger is that the health authorities do not crack down on this kind of advertisement, as if they have not seen it. Because the people's knowledge is too shallow, if lung patients believe the propaganda and do not fundamentally treat the disease but take that kind of "quack medicine", if they die, how much responsibility should the people who manufacture the quack medicine bear? The responsibility of newspapers is to educate the people. With this kind of advertisement, not only is the educational nature lost, it is equivalent to spreading toxins. I hope that newspapers should refuse to publish this kind of unscientific and irresponsible advertisement, and the health authorities should also strictly crack down on it, so that advertising, like news, can become something educational.

### Tomato Trivia

— Guan Rong

The tomato, transliterated as "Tomato" or "Tomanto," is a type of vegetable plant. Its stem can grow several feet high and spreads like a vine. The leaves are pinnate, compound, and densely covered in fine hairs. The flowers are pale yellow, and the fruit is bright red, resembling our Chinese persimmon. Like tobacco and potatoes, it originates from the Americas. After Columbus discovered the New World, it was introduced to Europe, but before the 18th century, Europeans were still unaware that it was edible. Legend has it that Walter Raleigh, Queen Elizabeth's lover, was the first to bring the seeds to England, hence it was called "Love-apple" at the time. This is also mentioned in Webster's Dictionary. Only in the early 19th century did Europeans begin to eat tomatoes, and they spread worldwide. In China's major cities, everyone knows what a tomato is, but in remote counties, few have ever seen one. Tomatoes have a strong vitality and come in many varieties, from small cherry tomatoes with tiny leaves to large beefsteak tomatoes, each weighing two to three pounds. Ordinary ones are about the size of a fist, round, but often grow into irregular shapes. If tomatoes are not properly cultivated, they are prone to Verticillium wilt, which can cause the entire plant to wither, spread, and die. No other vegetable or fruit can be eaten raw, cooked, or made into sauce or juice as freely as the tomato. Since biologists announced that tomatoes contain abundant vitamins, their presence has been even more welcomed and widely cultivated!

In 1940, a man named George C. Hough near New York successfully crossbred tomatoes with potatoes, producing a hybrid that does not contain starch. He named it "Topato," adding another sibling between tomatoes and potatoes!

A month ago, Argentine President's wife Eva Perón was visiting the Swiss capital when she was pelted with tomatoes, a truly unique incident.

### Suicide

— Xiao Kangshi

Suicide is everywhere these days,

Unable to save oneself, unable to escape;

A coffin embraces the body, turning it into a dream,

Resenting the treacherousness of the human world!

The trend of suicide is rampant nowadays. Although its root cause lies in the sins of society and the treachery of the human world, the inability to save oneself and escape inevitably makes one feel that "life is but a dream!"

### Is It? Or Is It Not?

— Lei Yi

Here are a dozen questions that seem true but are not, and seem false but are not. Use your intelligence to decide whether they are "true" or "false." If you answer more than two-thirds correctly, you can be considered very good. Disinfectants are the same as preservatives. Neuropathy is the same as mental abnormality. Dolphins are a type of large fish. Dragonflies cannot sting people. Crabs cannot walk backwards. You can get measles more than once. Spiders are not insects. Sunflowers always face the sun. Beryl is not always blue.

A dog having a black palate in its mouth is proof of pure breed.

Niagara Falls is the largest waterfall in the world.

So-called "turtle shells" all come from turtles.

### A Week in Film

— Li Zhen

An excellent artistic film, "The Yearling," is the renamed and long-awaited "A Year-Old Ying."

"The Yearling" is a literary film that resembles a prose poem. The story is very simple, depicting the life of farmers in Florida, USA, with an eleven-year-old cousin as the protagonist, along with his parents. The daily lives of these three people constitute this plain story. However, through the expression of film art, we see this simple and unadorned literary work on the screen. This success should be attributed to director Clarence Brown, whose portrayal of characters and use of natural scenery have reached a transcendent level.

An Ordinary

"Mother and Son" depicts the issue of illegitimate children, but the author fails to find answers from the root of the problem. Instead, he weaves a tragic story. The development of Han Liren, Huang Su, and Han Chen – father, mother, and son – lacks careful arrangement, making the script seem scattered and too coincidental, weakening its effect.

If the script has shortcomings, then the director's performance is even worse. He cannot even make up for the deficiencies. The performance of "Thunderstorm" as a backdrop in the film becomes superfluous.

Actor Zhang Fa is the only success. Han Chen's character is portrayed vividly and prominently. Yan Shi's acting is formalistic and lacks inner performance. Lu Biyun grasps the character of her role for about half of the play, while Jiang Tianliu gives a vague and inconsistent impression.

Who would believe this is a top-notch romance? It is a complete lie. What "Where is the Beauty?" portrays is nothing more than the posturing and revelry of young masters who are bored with their idle lives.

"Where is the Beauty?" Therefore, it is a poisonous lie.

The first half of the script is extremely humorous, but it suddenly changes midway, turning from a farce into a horror show, which is very inconsistent in style.

Sun Jinglu performs well in the cast, while those who play servants, cooks, and drivers are all inappropriate. Wang Ban, a good actor, is wasted here, which is a pity. Not a Bad Comedy

This is a light comedy adapted from a stage play. The story is very simple, the plot is smooth, the dialogue is refined, and the actors are well-matched. Therefore, as a piece of entertainment, "Perfect Marriage" is not a bad stage play film.

Jin Shengtan, a famous scholar and student of the Imperial Academy, learned to imitate. Yan Hui, virtuous in character, upon seeing it, Shengtan is his pen name.

Suddenly, in the corridor, a commotion was heard among the scholars and students, arguing over the meat, you being thin and I being fat, and the hunger of the corpses." From then on, he used this pen name, each writing a critical essay to offer to Confucius. After the offerings, they argued over the steamed buns, you being large and I being small.

### Matchbox Camera

— Zhengyan

During World War II, personnel engaged in secret work used a very small camera. This camera can be held in the hand and is not easily detected by others. Even at first glance, it is mistaken for a box of matches. Its size is extremely small. During wartime, Kodak only produced one thousand of these confidential and wartime cameras.

This small camera can take half-inch square photos. At the same time, there is another darkroom box that can be hidden in a pocket. The box contains a sixteen-roll film, bullets filled with photographic chemicals, and other necessary items for developing photos. It can be said that everything needed for developing is available. During development, simply place the film in a small glass container filled with chemicals.

The "MB" model camera is loaded with two feet of film, which can take about sixty photos. The lens ranges from F5 to F11, the shutter speed is 1/50th of a second, the distance scale is from eight feet to infinity, and the camera box has no viewfinder. To use it, simply press the small button on the camera with your finger, and the photography is complete when you hear a soft "click."
