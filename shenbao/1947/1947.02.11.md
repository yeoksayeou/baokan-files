### National Army Begins Large-Scale Sweep on Both Sides of Dangshan-Shangqiu Railway, Part of Communist Army Near Linyi Captured

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] The National Army is now launching a large-scale sweep of Liu Bocheng's forces who are roaming between Jieshan and on both sides of the Longhai Railway in Shangqiu. According to preliminary reports, about 5,000 members of Liu's forces have been eliminated in Zhouzhai, north of Dangshan, and Huizheji, south of Shangqiu. Liu's forces are showing a trend of being forced to flee back to western Shandong.

[Our Correspondent, Bengbu, 10th] The main force of Liu Bocheng's army has been defeated north of Hao County. The remaining troops, about 10,000 strong, crossed the Longhai Railway northwest of Shangqiu and fled north. Wei Fenglou's 10,000 troops still occupy Hao County.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 10th] The communist troops who crossed the Longhai Railway and fled south in eastern Henan are being encircled and monitored by the National Army, and they are in a situation of being annihilated individually. Since the National Army's powerful forces moved into Shangqiu, an indestructible barrier will be formed on the Longhai route, cutting off contact between the communist troops fleeing south and those in western Shandong. Their Third Column attempted to flee north from near Xiaoba on the 9th, but was intercepted and forced to retreat by the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] The Longhai Railway east of Zhengzhou Station is currently only accessible to Yejigang in Minquan West. Huang Shousong, Deputy Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, said after returning to Zhengzhou from an inspection in Minquan on the 10th that the fighting in Minquan was quite fierce.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 10th] Since the National Army moved into Laiwu and Xintai, the communist troops in Tai'an have been extremely panicked. They suddenly destroyed the Lizhu Church outside the West Gate of Tai'an the day before yesterday and burned the Catholic Church in the city. They have also been burying landmines on the Tai'an Railway Station and the Tai-Lai Highway for days, and requisitioning a large number of civilians to completely destroy the section of the Tai-Xin Highway from Tai'an to Cuijiajia Village.

[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 10th] The National Army, which recaptured Xintai, was engaged in sweeping operations in the suburbs and foreign areas on the 9th and 10th. The remnants of the communist army's 4th Division, which retreated westward from the city on the evening of the 8th, counterattacked the northwestern outskirts of the city after reinforcement on the morning of the 9th, but were repelled by the National Army. In addition, the National Army advancing towards Mengyin has also reached the area five kilometers east of the city. Within a ten-kilometer diameter around the city, no trace of the communist army has been found after two days of clearing by the National Army. The National Army is currently not only rushing to repair the highway from Xieshan to Xintai, but also strengthening the fortifications on both sides, so that this more than 100-kilometer-long communication line deep into the mountains can be ensured to be safe.

[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 9th] The National Army, advancing south from Zhai in Mengyin, took advantage of the victory and broke into Xintai City on the 8th. After clearing the battlefield, on the morning of the 9th, in addition to continuing to advance towards Mengyin along the highway with a part of its forces, it also used a part of its forces to intercept the communist army coming to reinforce from Sishui and Tai'an five kilometers north of the city. As of noon on the 9th, the two sides were still in fierce fighting.

[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 9th] The National Army, advancing north from Tancheng in southern Shandong, had crossed Mazhan and approached Lijiazhuang by noon on the 9th. Liu Bocheng's communist troops in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan are still dividing into several small groups between Hao County and Shangqiu, harassing everywhere. The National Army is encircling and pursuing them separately.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] The National Army in southern Shandong continued to advance north on the 10th and stationed near Huabu, Lijiazhuang, south of Linyi at noon, capturing and executing part of the communist army.

[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 10th] The main force of the communist army on the outskirts of Jinan has transferred part of its troops to southern Shandong and concentrated some in Guangrao and Shouguang, attempting to attack the middle section of the Jiaoji Railway and threaten the flanks of the National Army advancing south from central and southern Shandong. On the Jiaodong front, more than 10,000 communist troops also crossed the railway and marched south on the evening of the 8th. The communist troops near Jimo on the outskirts of Qingdao have now gathered to more than 10,000 people, attempting to advance into Jimo and cut off the railway between Chengyang and Nanquan. Therefore, general observations suggest that the pressure exerted by the communist army on the outskirts of Qingdao has not diminished, while the situation on the outskirts of Jinan has tended to ease.

[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 9th] The communist army's 7th and 9th Divisions, entrenched in Yucheng and Jiyang, crossed the Xiaoqing River east on the evening of the 7th, attempting to harass Zhangdian, Changshan, and Hucun, cut off the Jiaoji Railway, and threaten the flanks of the National Army advancing south. The National Army has been strictly on guard, and the safety of the rear can be ensured.

### Communist Troops Harass Outer Areas of Beiping, Invade Tong County Yesterday Morning But Were Repelled, Guxingyuan Convenes Meeting to Discuss Ensuring Security

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 10th] Tong County City and the two railway stations east and west of Beiping were besieged at zero o'clock on the morning of the 10th by more than 3,000 communist troops who had sneaked in from Xianghe. Because the defending forces were only a security squadron, the West Railway Station was captured and completely burned. A part of the communist army broke into the North Gate of the county seat, and parts of the county government, the Youth League Headquarters, and the Beiping Tram Company's power plant were burned down. The defending forces concentrated on the ancient pagoda in the city, and from the high ground, they killed more than 300 communist troops. Armored vehicles arrived at dawn and shelled the two railway stations, and the communist army retreated at 7 o'clock. The communist troops in the city retreated at the same time. As of the evening, the two armies were still fighting fiercely near the No. 1 Shuangqiao Station of the Beiping Broadcasting Station between Beiping and Tong County. The broadcasting station has stopped broadcasting today due to power outage. Only a small part of the Beiping tram is in operation. Trains and telecommunications to Tong County have been interrupted all day. At the same time, the Niulanshan and Zhangxin railway stations of the Ping-Gu Railway also suffered a feint attack by the communist army, which retreated shortly afterwards.

[Our Correspondent, Beigu, 10th] The foreign countries outside Beiping are nervous. The communist army besieged the Shahe Railway Station of the Ping-Sui Railway last night, and two groups broke into Shahe Town, set fires, and then retreated. The various military outposts of the National Army along the Nai Zifang and Sun River in northern Beiping are constantly being attacked by the communist army. The Daxing County Government has implemented a curfew throughout the county starting at 7:00 a.m. on the 10th. There are more than 1,000 communist troops active between Weishanzhuang and Lixian Town in southern Beiping.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 10th] The Beiping Pacification Headquarters convened a meeting of military leaders in Beiping on the afternoon of the 10th to discuss the security of the outer areas of Beiping in response to the attack on Tong County.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 10th] Zhou Kefeng, the magistrate of Tong County, is missing due to the communist attack. The prison was robbed, and all the prisoners escaped. Forty trucks in Tong County were also driven away by the communist army. A dozen station employees were captured, and daring people escaped and returned.

### Tight Encirclement of Baoding's Outer Areas, Garrison Forces Implement Alert

Song Kentang Goes to Bao to Command Military Affairs

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 10th] The outer areas of Bao are still tense. The communist army failed to attack Nandaran and attempted to attack the railway station again. Song Kentang, Chief of Staff of the 11th War Zone, went to Bao by special train on the morning of the 10th to command. All civil servants of Hebei Province have been undergoing military training since the 10th. In order to prevent the communist army from mingling with the city gates of Bao, five military-civilian cooperation stations have been set up to unify defense.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Military news: The communist army's Nie Rongzhen's First, Second, Third, and Fourth Columns, about 100,000 people, have been frequently moving around Baoding for days, spying on the city walls. Bao Zibin, the garrison commander of Baoding, has personally led his staff to implement vigilance since the 4th of this month, and the city defense of Bao has become more consolidated. In addition, the communist army between Gaobeidian and Baoding is still three columns, including nine brigades, of Nie Rongzhen's troops, and there has been no contact with the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 10th] The passenger train from Ping to Bao on the 8th derailed 112 kilometers north of Gucheng and was not repaired until 9:00 p.m., a delay of six hours.

### Legislators Suggest That the Executive Yuan Should Nationalize Gold, Proposal to Be Discussed at Legislative Yuan General Assembly

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 10th] Legislators Lou Tongsun and Jian Guansan, in view of the recent fluctuations in the gold market affecting the entire financial situation, suggested that the Executive Yuan should nationalize gold.

In addition, the Finance and Economics Committees will hold a meeting on the morning of the 11th to discuss the adjustment of the salt tax rate.

### Gold, Banknotes, and Commodity Prices Rise Sharply in Various Places, Tianjin, Hankou, and Kunming Adopt Measures to Suppress Them

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] Tianjin has taken emergency measures since the 5th to ban the black market in gold and U.S. dollars and prohibit food speculation. However, the runaway prices have not yet been completely curbed. The municipal government has now received an order from the Beiping Pacification Headquarters to hand over illegal merchants to the Garrison Headquarters and punish them in accordance with the emergency measures in times of emergency. Mayor Du Jianshi inspected the gold, banknotes, and food markets on the morning of the 10th and instructed merchants to assist the government in stabilizing prices and not to test the law.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] After Mayor She Jianzhi personally inspected the food market on the morning of the 10th, food prices in Tianjin have generally fallen on the afternoon of the 10th. A large bag of American flour has fallen by 3,000 to 7,000 yuan per bag, corn has fallen by 800 yuan per 100 jin, wheat has fallen by 500 yuan per 100 jin, beans have fallen by 3,500 yuan per 100 jin, and sorghum has fallen by 4,000 yuan per 100 jin.

[Our Correspondent, Fuzhou, 10th] Commodity prices in Rong have risen sharply in a whirlwind. U.S. dollars are 14,000 yuan, gold prices are 740,000 yuan, and rice has jumped out of the 160,000 yuan mark. The market situation is chaotic. Although the authorities are determined to stabilize prices by selling flat-rate rice, the quantity is small and the effect is negligible.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] Commodity prices here have risen sharply in recent days, especially food prices. The Provincial Council asked the Provincial Government to take measures and convened a symposium today, deciding to borrow food from the Bank of China, sell it at flat rates to public educators and students, and send money to the food production areas to purchase food and implement flat-rate sales.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] Commodity prices in Taiwan Province continue to rise. Gold ornaments cost 1.2 times more per tael, and the market price is 38,000 yuan, which is 1.33 million legal tender based on the official exchange rate of 1 to 35 between Taiwan and Shanghai. U.S. dollars cost 500 yuan, which is 17,500 legal tender. The black market exchange rate between Taiwan and Shanghai has fallen again, and today it is 1 to 23. The Food Bureau continues to sell flat-rate rice at 22.2 yuan per catty, but the black market is thriving, and rice prices are still hovering above 24 yuan. Food merchants dare not lower rice prices, apparently still hoarding. Official regulations require food merchants to sell all their hoarded goods in four phases, but this has not been seen.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 10th] Kunming City was stimulated by the skyrocketing gold prices and chips this week (3rd to 8th), and commodity prices changed with time. The entire market was in a chaotic state, and there was an unreasonable phenomenon: the price of gold in Kunming was more than 100,000 yuan higher per tael than in Shanghai. Provincial Chairman Yu Hanzeng once summoned Li Zhuo'an, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to inquire about the reasons for the skyrocketing gold prices in order to seek stability.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] Due to recent financial fluctuations and soaring gasoline prices, Guangzhou Public Transportation has suspended 90 buses on the 9th due to excessive losses, and another part will be suspended on the 10th. Currently, only 100 buses are available in the city (less than one-third of the original total), which is far from meeting the needs, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. Military and business officials said that if the government does not allow price increases and does not find a way to solve the gasoline problem, all buses will be suspended within days. (More news on gold market movements and price suppression can be found on pages 5 and 9)

### Government and U.S. Teams Withdraw to Ping One After Another

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 10th] Government and U.S. team members are withdrawing to Beiping one after another.

### China Trust Bureau Distributes 500 Boxes of Rayon Yesterday

(From our City News) The China Trust Bureau distributed more than 500 boxes of rayon to various factories yesterday, with the price still being 2.8 million. Since the bureau has been responsible for distributing rayon, all of its distribution targets have been silk weaving factories, so as to promote their start of production. It has never distributed rayon to merchants to avoid raising prices. The bureau currently has enough inventory to continuously distribute to various factories.

### Northeastern Forest Railway Dug Up and Transported Away

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] The northeastern forest area is vast and the logging is endless. It has always been known to the world as the land of forest sea. During the enemy and puppet period, in order to facilitate the convenience of logging and transportation, forest railways were laid in the central and northern forest areas of the Northeast, with a total length of 1,676 kilometers, including 21 narrow-gauge lines with a length of 1,260 kilometers, 6 broad-gauge lines with a length of 416 kilometers, and 264 German-made locomotives and 1,0114 combined vehicles. After the restoration, most of them were moved away by the Soviet army, leaving very little. According to those who escaped from the northern communist area, the remaining road rails were dug up last summer and all transported to a certain place for the purpose of opening up forests. This is a fatal blow to the development of northeastern forests in the future.

### U.S. Plans to Impose Import Taxes, U.S. Consulate is Requesting Instructions, May Obtain a Favorable Reply to Our Country

[Our News] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held its second meeting at 4:00 p.m. on the 10th on the third floor of the Central Bank. The meeting was attended by Chairman Bei Zuyi, Committee Members Lin Fengbao, Jin Shixuan, Qi Gongyun, and Shen Xixu. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m. Regarding the recent announcement issued by the U.S. Consul General that import taxes will be increased to counteract China's export subsidies, it is reported that this is a routine matter for the consulate and not a policy decision of the U.S. government towards China. Currently, U.S. Consul General Weituo is requesting instructions from the U.S. State Department in Washington. It is reported that a favorable reply to our country can be obtained soon.

In addition, the reporter inquired with U.S. Consul General Davis in this city about the truth of the matter and whether our country could obtain exceptional treatment. Mr. Davis replied that this matter is currently being requested from the U.S. State Department in Washington, and he is not in a position to make any comments before receiving a definite signature.

### Work of Receiving Dalian is in Progress

Military Authorities Deny Advancing Towards Dalian

[Our Correspondent, Jinyang, 10th] Huang Guangdou, Secretary-General of the Dalian Municipal Government, said that the preparatory work for the reception of Dalian is in active progress. Recently, it will recruit former Dalian policemen or Northeastern youths to train for more than three months at the 6th Police School in order to receive the city. As for the future unified reception of Dalian, both Nanjing and Shenyang are discussing with various agencies to avoid confusion and disputes.

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 10th] Military authorities here stated that no order to advance towards Dalian has been issued.

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 10th] The National Army on the front line in Pulandian is still in its original position. Gong Xuesui telegraphed here saying that the reception of Dalian is waiting for the opportunity. He himself cannot come to the Northeast in the short term, and the foreign reports are inaccurate.

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 10th] The Soviet army stationed north of the Xie Ding Xian in Shihe has not yet withdrawn. Xizidian, southwest of Piziwo, is the water source of Dalian and is still outside the Xie Ding Xian and is also stationed with Soviet troops. Generally, people say that this is actually convenient for the chaos caused by the communist army south of Pulandian. According to Jiang Tian, a communist army squad leader who surrendered to the National Army, the communist army south of Pulandian is quite scorned by the Soviet army.

### Strengthening Sichuan-Kang Defense, Zhang Qun Presides Over Pacification Conference in Chengdu

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 10th] Zhang Qun, Director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, convened the 36th Annual Sichuan-Kang-Pacification Conference on the 10th to strengthen the security and defense of Sichuan and Kang provinces. The attendees were Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, and more than 20 others. Zhang made a general report first, and made a detailed review of the past security work in Sichuan and Kang provinces.

The meeting will continue on the 11th to discuss.

### Northeastern Communist Army Transportation is on the Eve of Collapse, Railway Employees Flee to National Army Area

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] Railway employees in the northeastern communist-occupied area have fled into the National Army area one after another. Zhang Lianju, the general affairs officer of the Qian Gorlos Banner Station, and Gu Shijie, the stationmaster of the Baichengzi Station, and 15 other people fled to Nong'an in groups. It is reported that the railway in the communist area lacks the necessary materials, and the supply has been cut off. The number of locomotives is decreasing day by day due to insufficient parts. All bridges on the railway are buried with explosives, ready to be destroyed when retreating. The treatment of railway employees is extremely harsh, with no wages or body protection. At present, the transportation in the northeastern communist area can be said to be on the eve of total collapse.

### Taipingshao in Liaodong Recovered

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] The National Army in Liaodong recovered Taipingshao on the morning of the 5th. The main force of the communist army's 11th Brigade and the 10th Brigade fled to the vicinity of Huanren (Note: Taipingshao was invaded by the communist army on the 31st of last month). On the 6th, they gathered the remnants of their troops and attempted to attack Huanren but were repelled.

### Communist Army in Southern Shandong Issues Large Denomination Banknotes Again

[Our Correspondent, Nantong, 10th] In order to disrupt the national finance, the communist army once abused the issuance of a large number of anti-currency banknotes. Recently, it has manufactured a large number of 2,000-yuan face value banknotes in southern Shandong. The banknotes were printed by the Central Printing Factory in 1945 and are cyan in color. These counterfeit banknotes have been discovered in the Donghai area. Except for the slightly inferior paper quality, they are almost indistinguishable. The authorities in northern Jiangsu are closely monitoring the situation.

### Taiyuan Military Authorities Refute Yan'an Broadcasting

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th] According to the military authorities here, Yan'an has been broadcasting for days that the communist army invaded the territory of Dingxiang County on January 29, and annihilated and captured more than 500 National Army security deputy regimental commanders and below in Lingshi on the 30th (later changed to more than 990 people), and captured more than 2,000 National Army regimental commanders and above in Wenshui, which is purely fabricated. Dingxiang was peaceful and uneventful last month, and the county territory has always been in the hands of the National Army, so the so-called capture of so many National Army troops is even more absurd. In the battle of Lingshi, the National Army had a direct contact with the invading communist army as a company, and Wenshui City also had only three companies, so how could there be hundreds or thousands of National Army troops captured by them? In fact, most of the soldiers also broke through and returned to their units.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 10th] The 54th Decision Conference of the Central Standing Committee was held at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th in the State Council Conference Room after the Central Memorial Week.

(Note: There are 52 new legislators, 25 supervisors, and 44 political councilors.) (2) Regarding the issue of the number of standing committee members of the Kuomintang Selection and Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee, it was decided that the Kuomintang and social elites should jointly occupy three-quarters, totaling 93 members. (Note: There are a total of 125 standing committee members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee, and the remaining one-quarter, namely 32 members, will be elected by the Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties.)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Central Standing Committee today approved the principles for the allocation of seats for Kuomintang members and non-party members as standing committee members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee, and for the newly added legislators, supervisors, and political councilors. Regarding the allocation principles for standing committee members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee and the newly added supervisors and political councilors, it was decided on three items: (A) allocation of seats, (B) allocation principles, and (C) allocation of candidates.

### People's Socialist Party Candidates for Government Participation: Decision Expected at this Week's Standing Committee Meeting; Zuo Shunsheng Denies Submitting List

[Our Report] The People's Socialist Party's list of candidates for participation in the government and the selection of delegates to go to Beijing are currently in the stage of exchanging views, and a decision is expected at this week's standing committee meeting. According to a senior member of the party who told reporters: Mr. Zhang Junmai, as a senator, cannot participate in the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan after the reorganization. There are two opinions within the party regarding participation in the government. One is to participate in the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan to engage in constitutional work, but not to participate in administrative agencies, because the current war has prolonged, and the economy has declined. If the People's Socialist Party fully participates in the government, it will not help the current difficulties and will be jointly responsible. This is what Mr. Zhang Junmai advocates. The other faction advocates that if we don't participate, we don't participate. If we want to participate, we must participate fully, obtain a portion of power, and take actual responsibility. The current reorganization of the government is in fact a kind of "expansion." Based on the current situation, it is speculated that the participation of the People's Socialist Party in the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan may only be the first step in participating in the government. After the Third Plenary Session, some people within the People's Socialist Party may believe that the government has high sincerity in ending political tutelage and demand full participation.

[Our Report from Nanjing, 10th] Zuo Shunsheng returned to Beijing at 2 PM on the 10th. Regarding the list of names for participation in the government and legislative and supervisory committees, Zuo firmly stated that he had not made this preparation. The rumor that he brought a list is not accurate. However, he said that the Young China Party's principle of participating in the reorganized government has long been determined and has not changed. Zuo will not leave Beijing for the time being. Chen Qitian went to Shanghai at 3 PM on the 10th to attend the Young China Party's weekly meeting.

### Resolutions of the Chongqing Municipal Assembly: Appeal for Peaceful Unification

[Our Report from Chongqing, 10th] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chongqing Municipal Assembly opened at 10 AM this morning, chaired by Speaker Hu Zi'ang. After the opening remarks, the standing committees on politics, economy, society, culture, and education made work reports. Previously, Senator Gu Duo proposed hanging the party flag at the meeting.

### British Transportation Delegation: Visits Various Authorities in Our Country

Minister Wang Scheduled a Banquet

[Our Report from Nanjing, 10th] In addition to negotiating the conclusion of an aviation agreement with our transportation authorities, the British transportation delegation also exchanged views with our side on water transportation matters. It is heard that the British side still hopes that the steamships of Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire can sail on our inland rivers, but this request will inevitably be difficult for us to accept. The delegation has been visiting our relevant authorities in recent days.

### The Wreckage of a Missing Aircraft on the Guangzhou-Chongqing Route of China National Aviation Corporation Was Found on a Mountain in Guizhou Province. A Ground Search Team Will Go to Investigate the Truth Today.

[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation's Guangzhou-Chongqing Flight 138 went missing on the way to Chongqing on the 26th of last month in the area where Sichuan and Guizhou provinces meet. After the company authorities sent a plane to search for it, the wreckage of a destroyed aircraft was found on a high mountain between Zunyi and Tongzi in Guizhou Province, but because the deep mountains were shrouded in clouds and fog, it was not possible to determine whether it was Flight 138. The Chongqing branch of China National Aviation Corporation has organized a ground search team, which will depart for the Guizhou border today to search for the wrecked aircraft. The mission of this ground search team will be one of the most difficult and arduous in history, because the aircraft is far away on a barren mountain 6,000 feet above sea level, a place rarely visited by people. The search team will first advance along the Chongqing-Guiyang Highway, and then turn into no man's land led by orientation personnel. It is estimated that if there are no other unexpected obstacles on the road, it will take at least two days to reach the location of the destroyed aircraft. The search team will carry enough tools, food, etc. The number of people is ten, in addition to technical personnel, it is said that there are also several family members of the passengers on the plane.

### Original Reason for Ding Ni Mo's Judgment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Ding Mocun was sentenced to death by the Capital High Court on the 8th. Due to the significance of Ding's case, the High Court took great care in preparing the judgment. The original reasons for the judgment are published below:

Regarding the False Positions Held

The defendant in this case, Ding Mocun, served as the director of the Special Operations Headquarters, a representative of the National Congress, a standing member of the Central Executive Committee of the Puppet Government, the Minister of Social Affairs of the Central Party Headquarters of the Puppet Government, the Minister of Social Affairs of the Puppet Executive Yuan, a member of the Central Political Committee of the Puppet Government, the Minister of Transportation of the Puppet Government, the Minister of Social Welfare of the Puppet Government, the Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council of the Puppet Government, the Deputy Director of the Political Security Department of the Puppet Government, and the Governor of Zhejiang Province concurrently as the Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters of the Puppet Government, the Director of Pacification in Hangzhou of the Puppet Government, and the Commander of the Provincial Security of the Puppet Government. During the investigation and trial, he repeatedly admitted these facts without denial. These admissions are consistent with the defendant's statements in the interrogation records of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the former Military Affairs Commission, as well as the defendant's confession. Furthermore, the public gazettes of the Puppet Executive Yuan (issues 62 to 70, which contain records of the defendant attending various meetings in his capacity as a puppet minister) can be used as evidence. The fact that the defendant participated in the puppet organization is extremely clear.

Killing Yu Hua

After the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, due to the concession system, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in Shanghai was still able to exercise its functions. The Puppet Special Operations Headquarters, because the staff of the court were loyal to the party and the country, enforced the law impartially, were unwilling to participate in the "peace movement," and were an obstacle to its work, secretly dispatched operatives at approximately 8:00 AM on November 23rd of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), ambushing them in front of the residence of Yu Hua, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the court, at 202 Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. They shot and killed him as he was on his way to the court to work, as a warning. Not only did the victim's wife, Yu Chenyin, provide a vivid description of the events, but the court also secretly submitted a report to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Furthermore, there are records in telegrams No. 5349 and No. 5350 dated November 29th of the same year (found in the administrative files of the former Shanghai Jiangsu High Court Second Branch), as well as in the Sino-American-Japanese Daily News dated February 30th of the same year (found on page 11 of Yu Chenyin's scrapbook) and the Pearl River Daily News dated March 20th of the 29th year of the Republic (found on page 19 of the aforementioned scrapbook), and the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily News dated March 24th of the same year (found on page 18 of the aforementioned scrapbook), which can be used as evidence.

The Zheng Pingru Case

Zheng Pingru was the daughter of Zheng Yue, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in Shanghai. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), she joined the Investigation and Statistics Office of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. In the spring of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the office secretly dispatched her to infiltrate the Special Operations Headquarters, instructing her to seize opportunities to sanction the rebels. Zheng Pingru used her teacher-student relationship with Ding Mocun to feign closeness. Therefore, at 5:00 PM on February 21st of the same year, she also used the excuse of buying a coat to lure Ding Mocun to the Siberia Fur Store at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road. The operatives who were ambushed there opened fire, but the plot failed because the defendant was alert. Zheng Pingru was arrested by the Puppet Special Operations Headquarters on the 26th of the same month and executed shortly afterward. The details of this attack have been clearly testified to by the victim's brother, Zheng Huajun, and the witness Pan Sansheng (see the interrogation record entrusted by the Shanghai High Court on December 11th, 1946). The content of the public letter No. 5167 of the "Three-Five-Nine" Directive dated December 9th, 1946, from the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is consistent with this, and can be considered true.

Killing Patriots

Xu Ke, a member of the First Intelligence Group of the underground workers of the Shanghai District of the former Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau, was shot and killed in Shanghai on May 24th of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Li Chuchen, the leader of the Fifth Intelligence Group, was arrested for failing to sanction Ding Mocun and Li Shiqun in Shanghai and was killed on February 25th of the same year. Chen Zhaoqing, a member of the Fifth Intelligence Group, was arrested for failing to sanction Li Shiqun and was killed on February 25th of the same year. Xu Shouxin, a telegraph inspector, was killed on March 27th of the same year for communicating with the Central Government. Yu Yanzhi, the captain of the Fifth Action Team, was killed on December 27th of the same year for hiding military supplies. Zhou Xiliang, a communicator, was executed on December 27th of the same year for stealing important documents. Xu A'mei, a direct communicator, was also executed in December of the same year. Peng Furong was arrested for carrying out an action case in Shanghai and was killed on April 13th of the same year. All eight of the above were arrested and killed by the Puppet Special Operations Headquarters, as evidenced by the telegram No. 4731 from the former National Government Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau on October 22nd, 1946. The above-mentioned deceased Central Government personnel were all brutally murdered during the defendant's tenure as the director of the Special Operations Headquarters, and the defendant must bear full responsibility.

Acts and Words of Collusion with the Enemy

The Puppet Central Political Committee was the highest organ of the puppet organization. All puppet national policies related to politics, economy, diplomacy, and military affairs were decided by the committee. The defendant was appointed as a member of the committee by the traitor Wang Zhaoming at the beginning of its establishment and remained in office until the victory. The defendant served on the committee for many years and, as he himself admitted, should be jointly responsible for all decisions of the committee. Although the defendant claimed to "not remember," "not participate in," or "oppose" various important proposals of the committee, such as the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Alliance Treaty, and the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, these are clearly evasive words and it is difficult to accept his empty words of denial. Furthermore, during his tenure as the Minister of Social Welfare of the Puppet Government, the defendant published an article entitled "New Year's Sentiments" (see page 35 of the New Year's Special Edition of the Puppet Central Daily News published by the Puppet Central Daily News Agency in February 1944), advocating that "only with the victory of the Greater East Asia War can the East Asian nations be liberated." He exaggerated the war power of the Japanese invaders, promoted military build-up, and intensified the training of young people, attempting to fight alongside the enemy to defeat Britain and the United States in order to realize Greater East Asiaism. His collusion with the enemy and treasonous intentions are evident and cannot be concealed. (To be continued)

### Editorial: Political Factors in the Gold Rush

The gold and currency surge has suddenly become frenzied since the Lunar New Year. Yesterday, the price of gold knocked on the door of seven million, and the black market price of US dollars also rose to thirteen thousand yuan, and there was no price for the market, the situation is extremely chaotic, and people are panicking; because the rise in the price of gold will inevitably involve the rise in general prices, making industry and commerce shrink, and people's livelihood is more difficult. Regarding the emergence of this trend, this newspaper has written articles to expound its views, believing that the people should have a healthy mentality and the government should clarify and implement firm policies. At that time, the price of gold was still hovering around 4.8 million, but only five days later, the price of gold soared to knock on the door of seven million, only a few short days away from 396.5 on February 1st, and the price of gold has risen by about 76%; the madness of the surge can be imagined. The reason why the current gold price surge is so crazy is that speculation is certainly an important factor, but there are also several points that deserve our attention.

First of all, what we want to point out is that the price of gold in Shanghai was originally lower than in Tianjin and North China. On February 1st, when the price of gold in Shanghai was still hovering around 396.5, the price of gold in Tianjin was already at 540.7, Beijing was at 52.5, and Xi'an was at 500.5. Among them, the price of gold in Taiyuan was the most expensive. Merchants can make huge profits by transporting gold from Shanghai to North China; and the reason why the price of gold in North China is more expensive than in Beijing and Shanghai, in addition to geographical factors, there must be other reasons. After "anti-currency" exchanged for goods in the "liberated areas," they then exchanged goods for legal currency and gold, thus raising the price of gold in North China. Merchants found it profitable, so they competed to transport gold north. A batch of gold recently seized by Tianjin Customs is a significant example of the northward transportation of gold. Therefore, the recent surge in gold prices in Shanghai seems to be not simply an economic problem, but there is still a great political effect here.

Fearing that China will not be chaotic and that China's economy will collapse, causing national unrest, is a consistent strategy of the Communist Party; this was also mentioned by Marshal Marshall, who regarded himself as a mediator, that a shortcut to promoting China's economic collapse is to raise prices, forcing industry and commerce to be unable to maintain and people unable to live. To achieve this goal, promoting a gold rush is the fastest means. Therefore, from the perspective of the Communist Party's consistent strategy of making China trend towards economic collapse, the current gold rush inevitably has the Communist Party playing a role. General speculative merchants are concerned about current interests, or have not thought that the storm-raising in the gold market, if it causes an economic panic and promotes economic collapse, will fall into the trap of the Communist Party. In the final analysis, if the economy really collapses and the Communist Party's strategy is completed, it will not be a beneficial thing for themselves.

Therefore, we want to appeal to the general people engaged in gold trading to put national interests first, and not just consider current temporary interests. If China's economy deteriorates again and becomes irreversible, the benefits that have been won now will inevitably be lost. They should understand that this is not a result they would like to see. We would like to reiterate our previous argument that we must establish our healthy mentality and rebuild our confidence in ourselves and our nation. For the sake of our nation's future, and also for the sake of our individual futures, we cannot allow our economic situation to deteriorate further: we must do our best to save all kinds of declining trends.

But here we must also point out the government's responsibility for the current gold rush. One of the immediate causes of the current gold rush is undoubtedly the issuance of large-denomination banknotes. The surge in gold prices is taking place after the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, and the causal relationship between them is self-evident. The issuance of large-denomination banknotes indicates that the government itself seems to have lost confidence in the banknotes it issues, which led to the rise in general prices. Speaking of its distant cause, it should be traced back to the past when gold savings were actually issued at a 60% discount. The government established gold savings in the hope of recalling legal currency; the people trusted the government, so they used their savings to buy gold, and at that time, the government also encouraged it in many ways. Who knew that the people handed over their hard-earned savings to the government; and when the government issued gold, it suddenly ordered a 60% discount. This shows that the government does not value its promises; instead, it is like a fraudulent means to defraud the people's savings. As a result, the people gradually lost trust in the government and dared not hand over their savings to the government again, so they competed to buy gold and US dollars, resulting in the situation today. The government itself should bear most of the responsibility for our economic and political situation reaching today's state. It is not that the people automatically lost faith in the government, but that the government's various measures forced the people to abandon their trust in the government. Therefore, in the current gold rush, the people should rebuild confidence, and the most important thing is how the government can gain the trust of the people. The government must first establish confidence, and then the people's trust in the government can be rebuilt. The government should quickly come up with a solution.

In short, the various phenomena in China's economic circles today cannot escape the political factors. The current economic decline in China is mainly due to the actions of the Communist Party. Because of the existence of the Communist Party's military and even economic struggles, the government has not been able to take thorough measures to improve our country's economic situation in the year or so after the victory. At the same time, all the government's measures may not achieve their expected goals. At the time of economic deterioration, we want to urge the government to take decisive measures to quickly prevent the further deterioration of the situation.

### Riot and Jailbreak by Prisoners in Shashi, 112 Fugitive Major Criminals

Most are traitors and those sentenced to death or life imprisonment

[Report from Hankou by this newspaper] Regarding the jailbreak of more than 100 major criminals from the Shashi District Court Detention Center, the reporter recently met with someone from Shashi who spoke about the details of the jailbreak at the time, with many prominent points. Whether this case was a planned action by the criminals or a release by the guards, all parties are paying close attention. The content is briefly recorded as follows: It is said that the detention center of the court is located on Sanmin Street in Shashi. The director, Mr. Li, went to Hankou a month ago and has not returned. During this period, the main person in charge of the detention center was only a prison official and a security director. Whether the guard in the center was therefore negligent is questionable. At the same time, according to the guards of the detention center:

Before this case occurred, the prisoners in the first and second cells of the detention center often used

Japanese to communicate

The guards did not know Japanese, so they did not notice anything else. Until 11:35 PM on January 29th, all the staff of the detention center had gone to bed, and there were only three guards on night duty. Two of them were guarding the third prison, and the other was specially guarding inside the gate, on duty. While patrolling, the traitor Wang Shuyiao from the second cell,

Claimed to be thirsty

Requested the night watchman Wan Guohua to give him a bowl of cold water. Wan immediately agreed and handed the cold water through the wooden fence. After receiving the water, Wang suddenly grabbed Wan's hand and called another prisoner to strangle Wan's throat, making him unable to move. The bandit Nie Peng and others also immediately responded. For a time, dozens of prisoners worked together to dismantle the wooden pillars and

Swarmed out

First, they tied up the guard Wan, and then, led by the two criminals Wang Shuyiao and Nie Peng, tied up the two guards who were dozing off, seized two rifles from the soldiers, and forced them to hand over the keys.

### A Serious Report by the U.S. Government: An Analysis of Soviet Strength (Middle)

Stalin Assumes Great Power in Raising the Quality of the Red Army

The organization and strength of the Red Army are kept highly secret. Although the Red Army suffered significant losses in the early stages of the German-Soviet war, they were still able to absorb a sufficient number of reinforcements to rebuild their peak strength, reaching approximately 20 million. This number has been reduced somewhat during postwar demobilization.

According to an Associated Press dispatch, a senior Allied officer stated on June 2, 1946, that the Soviet Union had 6 million armed personnel at that time and was preparing to reduce its army to a standing strength of 4.5 million.

In the early stages of the German-Soviet war, the Red Army's numerical advantage was partially offset by technical difficulties. It relied heavily on its historically renowned artillery to deter the German advance, giving the Soviet army the opportunity to train and equip sufficient tank forces.

During the war, although many of the most important industrial areas were occupied by the enemy, the Soviet Union was still able to provide adequate equipment to support its greatly expanded army. Most of this equipment relied on U.S. lend-lease materials.

The Red Army's training program is based on the assumption that future wars will be wars of machines and machines, requiring a large number of personnel trained in various military technologies. Marshal Stalin pointed out that trained personnel (i.e., those proficient in various specialized skills) are the decisive factor in all aspects. According to this instruction, the Red Army has established various schools to teach various military subjects.

Special political instructors often go deep into the front lines with the soldiers to explain recent important news, convey daily bulletins from the intelligence bureau, and make the soldiers familiar with the domestic and international situation. The Red Army also runs various research associations, teaching various industries and establishing many subjects.

Soviet Deputy Minister of Public Health Dr. Pliarov declared that the Red Army's medical achievements during World War II exceeded those of any participating country - the mortality rate in the Red Army's rear hospitals was only 1.1%, and 73% of wounded soldiers returned to the battlefield after treatment.

We do not know what materials Dr. Pliarov based this comparison on. The U.S. military is compiling mortality records in front and rear military hospitals during World War II. 73% of wounded U.S. Army soldiers returned to duty on the battlefield.

In recent years, a special class has emerged in the Soviet army. The Red Army is developing along a new path, very similar to the armies of old Russia and other capitalist countries. The line between soldiers and officers is becoming clearer every day. Following the rise of the Red Guards, an aristocratic military class has risen, enjoying special privileges and receiving salaries higher than those of other troops.

The Communist Party now controls the highest military organs. The leadership of the Party and the military are mixed together, making it difficult to distinguish them. However, above all, standing in the highest position is Stalin, and all leadership powers are concentrated in his person.

### British Government's Electricity Rationing Plan: Birmingham Refuses to Comply

Fierce Debate to Unfold in the House of Commons

[Reuters, London, 10th Dispatch] Hours before the British government's electricity rationing plan was scheduled to begin, the industrial city of Birmingham, deeming the government's plan impractical, decided not to comply. However, the city's 310,000 household users will automatically stop using electricity during the prescribed rationing hours, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily, based on their goodwill. Because the source of electricity for industrial and household use is the same, and industrial electricity has been decided to be supplied as usual, household electricity cannot be cut off separately. Some areas of London, due to the presence of major industries not subject to rationing, have also decided that household users will voluntarily stop using electricity. Cabinet members related to coal and electricity continued to discuss the matter today and study criticisms from various aspects. Officials from the Ministry of Fuel and Power were busy signing and replying to protests and inquiries from all over the country, and Shinwell himself did not leave his office from morning to night.

[Reuters, London, 10th Dispatch] The Battersea Power Station in London started today to have four people controlling electricity supply by moving the machinery to gradually reduce the amount of electricity supplied to each small station. Within half an hour, the hourly supply of 250,000 kilowatts of electricity was reduced to 100,000 kilowatts, and it is estimated that 135,000 pounds of coal can be saved per hour.

[Reuters, London, 10th Dispatch] Prime Minister Attlee is scheduled to make a statement to the House of Commons today, explaining the electricity rationing measures that will take effect at midnight tonight. Churchill will personally attend the meeting at that time. Prior to that, the Conservative Party's leadership and its Fuel Committee will convene a special meeting. It is expected that the debate will unfold in a day or two.

[Reuters, London, 9th Dispatch] Scotland Yard received a telephone call from the southern end of London on Saturday, stating that a time bomb would explode at the residence of Fuel and Power Minister Shinwell this morning. After searching and preparing, the police found no incident occurred.

### Viet Minh's Attitude

President Ho Chi Minh declares: If France cannot resolve the current dispute through peaceful means, the Viet Minh government will request arbitration from the United Nations…

[Reuters, Singapore, 9th] Due to the "iron curtain of press censorship" imposed by the French authorities in Saigon, our correspondent in Vietnam, Mr. Ganpeier, had to send a special messenger to deliver an important statement from President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic to our Singapore office for publication. Ho Chi Minh, from a location in Vietnam (the whereabouts of which are unknown to the French), wrote to Ganpeier stating that if France cannot resolve the current dispute through peaceful means, the Viet Minh government will request arbitration from the United Nations.

The French authorities impose military censorship on all telegrams sent abroad, which is somewhat reasonable, but the censorship is so strict that no journalist, even after paying the telegraph fees, knows the fate of their telegrams. The censorship authorities never notify the sender of any deletions or bans, a situation unprecedented in the world of censorship. (According to Ganpeier's report, our headquarters has already lodged a serious protest with the French government tonight regarding the newly implemented censorship system in Vietnam.) The following is the telegram sent by Ganpeier via special messenger to Singapore:

Saigon (delayed): Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh government, from a location near Hanoi, wrote to the reporter in response to several questions posed by the reporter. Ho Chi Minh stated that if France cannot resolve the current dispute through peaceful means, the Viet Minh is prepared to request arbitration from the United Nations. Other questions and answers are as follows:

Question: Under what conditions is the Viet Minh government prepared to cease hostilities and resume negotiations with the French government?

Answer: The only desire of the Viet Minh people is national unification (including Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin, where Annamese is spoken) and independence. We have no other demands. Once this goal is achieved, we are prepared to immediately cease hostilities and negotiate peace.

Question: If the French side cannot accept these conditions, what action will be taken?

Answer: If the French side cannot resolve the dispute peacefully, the Viet Minh government will request arbitration from the United Nations—perhaps the Four Powers would be best suited to undertake this task.

Question: What is the impact of the current war on the Vietnamese economy?

Answer: The national economy has been severely affected by the war. Production has sharply declined to one-tenth of its former level, coal production to one-fifth, and rice production to one-quarter. The number of civilians killed and towns destroyed by French bombing is impossible to estimate.

Question: Does the Viet Minh authorities provide adequate care for French people?

Answer: Yes, the treatment of these French people is far better than the treatment of the Viet Minh people under French rule. Many French people have written to thank us.

Ho Chi Minh continued: I wish to present the following facts to the reporters who have been deceived by French propaganda. The French claim that the Viet Minh is a tool of the Japanese is completely fabricated. Americans in Kunming, Yunnan, can attest to this, as these American friends were guests of our anti-Japanese guerrillas as late as the end of August 1945. They can tell the reporters the truth. The French also claim that the Viet Minh is a Communist Party. The full name of the Viet Minh is the Viet Minh Independence League. It is composed of various political parties, including the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, the Nationalist Party, the Marxist Party, and non-partisan organizations such as Catholics, Buddhists, Confucians, and landlords. Ninety percent of its members are participating in the struggle for independence based entirely on patriotic fervor. There are also members of various factions and non-partisans participating in the Viet Minh government, such as the Minister of the Interior, Huang Tao Kang, who is seventy years old and was exiled by the French to Poulo Condore for fourteen years. Our policies are by no means communist, nor even socialist.

Ho Chi Minh continued: The French also claim that this war was initiated by the Viet Minh. To clarify the truth, one must recall the French policies since March 6 of this year, such as the failure to implement the Franco-Vietnamese agreements, the large-scale terrorist activities in Cochinchina, the occupation of Ba Ninh in southern Annam, the blockade of Haiphong Harbor, the siege of Lang Son, the continuous increase of French troops, the daily acts of provocation by French soldiers, and the massacre and looting by French troops in Hanoi on December 17 of last year. I have appealed to the French government without receiving a response. Recently, Mr. Dupeyrat, who accompanied the French Minister of Colonies, Moutet, on a visit to Vietnam, wrote an article in "Le Figaro" in Paris. Although there are some errors, the true cause of the Vietnam incident can be gleaned from it. We know that the French have superior weapons, and regardless of the outcome of the war, the lives of our people will inevitably be devastated. Why would we initiate the war? In short, our only demands are unification, independence, and peace.

### Kesselring on Trial

[Reuters, Venice, 10th] Field Marshal Kesselring, former German commander-in-chief in Italy and Chief of Staff of the German Air Force during the Battle of Britain, is on trial here today before a British military court as a war criminal. The defendant is charged with two counts: (1) For the March 23, 1944 reprisal for the bombing that killed thirty-one German policemen, 335 Italian civilians were killed in the Ardeatine Caves near Rome.

(2) He ordered his subordinates to kill Italian civilians in June and July of the same year in retaliation for the activities of Italian guerrillas. The defendant pleaded not guilty in court today.

### Japanese Political Situation Falls into Chaos Again; Progressive Party Actively Seeks to Form New Party; Yoshida Still Seeks to Form Coalition Cabinet

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 10th] The Japanese political situation, after the Yoshida Cabinet safely navigated the February 1st general strike, has fallen into extreme chaos again within ten days. The Progressive Party, dissatisfied with Yoshida's cabinet reshuffle, after advocating the formation of a coalition cabinet for a week, has recently put forward the slogan of forming a new party. The party held a meeting of its top leaders this morning, deciding on the following: (1) The work of organizing a coalition government is unlikely to materialize quickly due to internal divisions within the Liberal Party. Therefore, a new party should be formed at this time to break through the current crisis. (2) The purpose of organizing a new party is not to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet, but its primary goal is to rebuild Japan. (3) All factions participating in the new party, including the Progressive Party, must dissolve their respective organizations to achieve unity. (4) The Progressive Party will work closely with those within the Liberal Party who support the new party and appeal to all parties to quickly form a new party. (5) The scope of the appeal is limited to the Cooperative Democratic Party, the Nationalist Party, and the Independent Club. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party are excluded, especially the latter, because it is feared that it would give the impression of dividing the Socialist Party. In the afternoon, the Progressive Party held an emergency executive meeting, deciding on the following three principles: (1) Reject all political actions based on maintaining the status quo; (2) Promote the realization of a major revolutionary party. The new coalition cabinet must be established on the basis of this spirit; (3) The Progressive Party will dissolve immediately when the opportunity for the establishment of the new party matures.

The Liberal Party today suggested to the Progressive Party that the presidents of the Liberal Party and Progressive Party, Kawai Atsushi (Progressive Party) and Ishibashi Tanzan (Liberal Party), and the secretaries-general of the two parties should jointly discuss the current situation, but this was rejected by the Progressive Party because the current political actions of the Liberal Party are premised on maintaining the status quo. Currently, various small parties are quite interested in the "revolutionary" party that unites the conservative camp, so there is more participation.

The Socialist Party is taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the Progressive Party's new party work, believing that the new party work is a transformed development of the "coalition" work, and the new party is by no means a socialist party. Currently, the faction within the Liberal Party that supports the new party movement is the faction centered around Hitoshi Ashida, who is still secretly contacting the Progressive Party in order to leave the Liberal Party. While the Progressive Party is loudly proclaiming the new party movement, Prime Minister Yoshida has begun his third attempt to form a coalition cabinet. This afternoon, he summoned Minister of State Kijuro Shidehara, Minister of Finance Tanzan Ishibashi, Minister of Welfare Atsushi Kawai, Chief Cabinet Secretary Joji Hayashi, Liberal Party Secretary-General Ono, Director-General Okubo, Kita Reikichi, and others to discuss the coalition work again. Ishibashi and Kawai, based on the results of secret negotiations with certain aspects of the Socialist Party over the past two days, put forward a new proposal, the content of which is not much different from the previous two conditions, namely (1) Ishibashi remains in office; (2) Three opposition parties are allowed to join the cabinet; (3) The distribution of cabinet seats is Liberal Party six, Progressive Party five, Socialist Party five. However, the Secretary-General of the Progressive Party, Tanaka, did not attend this meeting. Moreover, the Progressive Party advocates organizing a new party with a very tough attitude, so it is not necessarily in favor of this proposal. At this time, the question is what is the attitude of Yoshida and Shidehara towards the new party movement. The Progressive Party secretly anticipates that Yoshida and Shidehara will eventually have to join the new party. In short, the feelings between the Liberal and Progressive parties regarding the "coalition" issue are not as good as before. It is questionable whether they can maintain a friendly attitude in the parliament, which will reconvene on the 14th.

### U.S. Department of Agriculture Releases Report on World Rice Production

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture released its monthly report today, forecasting that world rice production in 1946-47 is expected to recover to approximately pre-war levels. China, India, and Japan are the world's largest rice consumers. Production in these countries is expected to increase this year, improving their food situation. However, because the domestic situations in rice-exporting countries such as Burma, Siam, and Vietnam have not yet returned to normal, the world's rice export supply is not expected to increase significantly compared to last year. According to recent information, the total production in 1946-47 is expected to reach 7.1 billion bushels, an increase of 11 percent compared to last year, and only 4 percent lower than the pre-war average annual production of 7.4 million bushels. China's harvest this year is expected to reach 2.31 billion bushels, an increase of 200 million bushels compared to last year. Among the three major exporting countries, Burma will have only 1 billion bushels available for export this year, while Siam and Vietnam will have very little available for export.

### Gold Rush; Public Welfare a Concern; Exercising People's Power; Councillors to Discuss Countermeasures; Finance and Social Welfare Committees to Convene Meetings

[Our Report] City Councillors Bu Yongsheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, and Yang Fusheng, in view of the recent soaring prices, jointly wrote to Chairman Pan, stating in brief: "The soaring price of gold is having a huge impact on prices, and people's livelihoods are in a precarious situation. Even if the government cannot prevent it, it should be regulated. The city of Tianjin has already banned the trading of gold and US dollars since the day before yesterday. Our city has also had precedents of intervening in speculation in the past. Why is it so laissez-faire? The City Council has an unshirkable duty to intervene and make effective measures. We urge the City Government to quickly add regulations so that prices can fall back, and the ordinary people can recover." According to Chairman Pan, he will convene the Finance and Social Welfare Committees to jointly discuss the problem. It is now known that the Secretariat of the Council has decided to convene a meeting on February 14.

### Mayor Speaks on the Fight at the Quan Gong Building "Conspirators Disrupted Order;" "Legally and Morally, There is No Excuse" "The Purpose is to Expand Anti-American Propaganda" "Serious Crime; Government Must Punish Severely"

[Our Report] Regarding the fight at the Quan Gong Building, Mayor Wu met with reporters at the City Government conference room at 5 pm yesterday to report on the handling of the incident. He said in brief: At 12:10 pm today, 19 units of various trade associations such as the city's cotton textile industry, totaling 19 representatives, came to the City Government to see me. They separately described the situation at the time and asked me to uphold justice, order an investigation into the culprits, and severely punish the murderers. At that time, I expressed my willingness to accept. They also presented promotional leaflets and distributed songs from the conference that day, containing evidence such as "Can't drive away the American army, unwilling", "American goods are harmful" and "Bastards who create civil war". The notice stated: "Dear Sirs, In order to promote domestic goods and save the crisis in industry and commerce, it has been decided to invite all manufacturers to the New Capital Theater, Guangxi Road and Tianjin Road (6th floor of the New World Department Store, elevator straight up) at 9:00 am on the 9th of this month to discuss the way forward. Please be there to give your valuable advice, this is addressed to ×× trade association. The Organizing Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Restricting American Goods."

Deceiving the Public Using False Pretexts

After reading it, I felt several doubts: (1) Since the association has no organization, no responsible person, and has not publicly solicited members, it is worthy of study that they use the name of promoting domestic goods to carry out anti-American work. (2) Now is the age of democracy, and all those who talk about democracy are reasonable, but the association should be an exception. All democratic gatherings should have a chairman publicly elected by the public, and the discussions must be consistent with the issued notices. The name and content of the meeting are different, so it can be inferred that it must be manipulated by someone, using the name to lure various trade associations. All those who are unfortunately deceived and participate are said to support their claims and can increase the crowd; all those who do not participate are said to have already acquiesced, this is a planned conspiracy, the purpose is to expand anti-American propaganda, and its crime is serious. The government must severely punish it.

Investigate Clearly and Punish Severely in Accordance with the Law

Finally, Mayor Wu issued three conclusions: (1) The innocent deaths and injuries of citizens in this incident are all the fault of the conference organizers. If it were not for the convening of this "selling dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head" conference, this bloody incident would not have occurred. The government has the right to investigate this incident thoroughly. Not only legally but also morally, these conspirators cannot escape blame. (2) For this incident, all newspapers should show a sense of justice, so that the public can distinguish between true democracy and false democracy, and which is true freedom and which is false freedom. Now in democratic countries such as Britain and the United States, anyone who has a public gathering must report to the local government in advance, and the people of the Soviet Union must have their public gatherings approved by the government. For illegal gatherings, I hope that citizens will report them as much as possible. (3) The gathering at the Quan Gong Building was not informed to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau in advance. Both emotionally and rationally, it is illegal. It is obvious that someone is causing trouble, trying to disturb the social order of the city. I hope that these troublemakers will show their conscience and spare the people of Shanghai! For this incident, I have ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to quickly investigate the matter clearly and punish it severely in accordance with the law, and to expose the conspiratorial price of the troublemakers to the public and subject them to social sanctions.

### General Union Emergency Meeting; Decided to Thoroughly Investigate the Facts

The City General Union convened an emergency standing committee meeting at 3 pm yesterday, attended by Shui Xiang , Liang Yongtai, Fang Rusheng and more than ten others, to discuss the Quan Gong Building incident. They unanimously believed that the facts should be thoroughly investigated immediately for verification and resolution. The following decisions were made: (1) Appoint three directors, Gui Fusheng, Tang Genbao, and Qin Yulin, to be responsible for handling the matter. (2) Appoint Chairman Shui, Secretary-General Liang, and Executive Director Qiu to visit the family of Comrade Liang Renda and send them 1 million yuan for funeral expenses. (3) Launch the Shanghai industrial community to raise condolences for the family of Liang Renda's death and publish it daily in the Li Pao to show the credibility. (4) Appoint all standing directors to visit Mayor Wu and request that the culprits in this case be severely punished in accordance with the law.

[Another Report] The workers' representatives of various industry unions who were deceived into participating in the "Promote Domestic Goods and Restrict American Goods Conference" went to the General Union at 2:30 pm yesterday. Regarding the Quan Gong Building fight incident, they requested that the murderers be severely punished.

### Responding to Fundraising; Consoling Liang Renda's Family

Since the Quan Gong Building tragedy occurred, the City General Union has reportedly begun raising condolences for the family of the deceased Liang Renda. Various industry unions responded one after another. As of last night, more than 3 million yuan has been received. After the amount is rounded up, it will all be delivered to Liang Jun's family. It is also heard that the General Union has accepted the request of various industry unions to form a Liang case compensation committee to speak out in support and handle funeral and post-mortem matters on the same day.

Also, after learning about the unfortunate incident at the Quan Gong Building, the City Party Department, yesterday morning, Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, Director Chen Baotai, went to the hospital to comfort the injured and to Liang Renda's house to offer condolences. According to the conversation, the City Party Department only learned about this incident after it happened. Chairman Fang Jinjing has not returned from Jinjing. This matter will be submitted to this week's Executive Committee for discussion. It is hoped that the authorities will investigate the responsibility and severely punish the culprits. The deep condolences were offered to the employees who were killed, and an appeal will be made to the society for relief and proper arrangements for the aftermath.

### The Workers Who Were Deceived Into Participating Issued a Statement Proposing Requirements

[Central News Agency] The workers' delegation from various industry unions in Shanghai who were deceived into participating in the "Promote Domestic Goods and Restrict American Goods Conference" issued a statement yesterday, saying: "Since the Quan Gong Building tragedy occurred, most newspapers in the city have been able to record the incident fairly. However, a very small number of newspapers with ulterior motives have distorted the facts and reversed right and wrong, which is quite confusing to the public. This delegation, on behalf of all the deceived and beaten workers, hereby solemnly declares and proposes the following requirements: (1) It is clear that we were invited to participate, but it is said that we were forced to enter. (2) It is clear that we are truly kind people, but it is said that we are "special elements". (3) It is clear that songs such as "American troops are going to run away quickly", "Can't drive away the American army, unwilling", "Bastards who create civil war" were loudly sung, but it is said that this is "promoting domestic goods". (4) It is clear that "Down with the National Government" was shouted, but it is said that this is "absolute patriotism". (6) It is clear that guards wearing red flowers and holding wooden sticks, who were arranged in advance, were the first to strike, but it is said that others beat them. (6) It is clear that they are the creators of the tragedy, but they claim to be "persecuted". (7) It is clear that Liang Renda sacrificed himself in opposing the fraud, but it is said that he is their comrade. Our requirements are: (1) We want to avenge the deceased. (2) We want to ask the government to investigate the culprits and punish the murderers. (3) We want to comfort the family of the deceased. (4) We want to help the injured. (5) We want to ask the government to protect good workers. Shanghai workers delegation of the city industries who are swindled to participate in the "promote domestic goods, resist American goods Congress" started.

### Workers Representatives Who Were Deceived Into Participating Went to the City Council to Petition Yesterday

[Our Report] The workers of various industry unions in the city who were deceived into participating in the so-called "Organizing Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Restricting American Goods" were beaten. The workers selected representatives Hu Kun, Zhang Jian and others. Yesterday, they went to the City Council in Fuming Village to petition where they were received by Secretary-General Xiang of the Council. Hu Kun reported the situation that the workers were deceived into participating in the meeting and were beaten, resulting in deaths and injuries. He asked the City Council to uphold justice. The representatives made three demands: (1) Who was the convener of the meeting? Because the notice of the meeting did not have the name of the person signing, nor did it specify the location, what was the purpose? The singing at the meeting not only called out against the US military, but also against the government. (2) Severely punish the perpetrators. (3) Demand compensation for the medical expenses of the injured workers and the compensation for the families of the deceased. In addition, he hoped that the Council would forward a letter to the Council and take the lead in advocating the promotion of domestic goods as soon as possible. Secretary-General Xiang replied that the matter of severely punishing the culprits will be discussed at the meeting. As for the leadership of all sectors to promote the movement of domestic goods, the Council has already made a resolution, and it is hoped that all sectors will work together for greater effectiveness. The representatives were satisfied and left.

### The Arduous and Extraordinary Beginning: Two Orphanages Combining Education and Care, Shining a Holy Light in the Darkness, Offering Warmth and Comfort to Unfortunate Children

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Several years ago, at the height of the war, when people were displaced and homeless, two true Christians received a great revelation from the Bible. The Bible says, "God is the father of orphans in his holy dwelling," and "Blessed are those who consider the poor...when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you.” These two devout Christians, seeing so many innocent children become orphans in the war, wandering the streets, deprived of human love and warmth, felt a pang of compassion. They believed it was time to carry out God's will, to give these orphans happiness and comfort. Although their power was limited, they could not save all the orphans in the world. But one, two, eight, ten... as far as their eyes could see, they brought them home from the streets, gave them affection, and educated them. One day, two days, one month, one year... the beginning was arduous, and the struggle was extraordinary. This great work has continued for several years. Now, the "Bethany Orphanage" and the "Immanuel Orphanage" have become quite a sight, with nearly four hundred orphans playing, singing, and living in a paradise of love.

Bethany Orphanage Wins Widespread Sympathy

The founder of "Bethany Orphanage," Pastor Qian Tuan Yun, originally preached at the Tian'an Church next to Renji Hospital. After the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8, 1940, the clutches of the Japanese reached into the concessions, and even the church could not avoid being under their control. Pastor Qian therefore withdrew from Tian'an Church. He said that at this time, he remembered the biblical teaching "God is the father of orphans in his holy dwelling," and began the work of taking in orphans. He himself did not have much money, but he was unwilling to solicit donations from the outside world. He only maintained the orphanage with the proceeds from selling his calligraphy, sharing the joys and hardships with the children. Gradually, the outside world learned about it, and there was no shortage of conscientious people in society. The sympathy and assistance he received increased day by day.

Envisioning Opening a Farm to Lead Rural Work

He rented a house on the former Route des Soeurs as the orphanage's address. Often, things sent by unknown people were thrown over the wall, and banknotes sent by unknown people were put into the mailbox. Even strangers personally sent money and gold bars. In this way, the number of orphans he took in increased day by day. Two enthusiastic church members sold their own properties to help him buy the former Zhengfeng College site on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, reaching the current scale of the orphanage.

Pastor Qian said: "I don't recognize this as just a charitable relief effort. I think this is a trial of an ideal, an experiment that combines school and family. I want them to receive a high school education, and I also plan to open an agricultural department and a farm so that they can go out and lead rural agricultural work after they turn twenty." The two hundred orphans he cared for lived a disciplined life, lively, healthy, and very polite.

The Immanuel Orphanage is Full of Loving Atmosphere

The "Immanuel Orphanage" is located within the Yuguang Village on Yuyuan Road. The two small Western-style buildings give an even warmer and more intimate feeling of home. One building is full of girls, all wearing blue cloth cheongsams, each with a red flower pinned on their heads, very neat and beautiful. The other building is for boys, who are also all wearing blue cloth long gowns. When they saw the visitors arriving, they sang a hymn in unison. The singing was so clear and crisp, filled with the world's true emotions of goodness and beauty, truly angelic music.

"Immanuel Orphanage" was founded by Miss Hu Yunlin, a graduate of the China Theological Seminary. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, she saw an orphaned girl with both parents dead in a refugee camp and felt deep sympathy and love. Thinking of the Bible's teaching "Blessed are those who consider the poor," she started by taking in this orphaned girl and gradually expanded her work. Now, the Immanuel Orphanage also has nearly two hundred orphans, receiving careful and loving education.

These two orphanages exist silently in the suburbs of this dark and turbid metropolis, seemingly like two lotus flowers in the mud, emitting a holy light. It tells us that there is still love in the world!

### The Love of Domestic Products Movement Is Not a Boycott of Foreign Goods: Initiator Hu Boxiang Issues a Statement; Absolutely Unrelated to the Quanggong Building Incident

Following the unfortunate incident at the Quan Gung Building on Nanjing Road yesterday morning, where some people, falsely claiming to be on behalf of the “Preparatory Committee for Loving Domestic Goods and Boycotting American Goods,” gathered and resulted in a brawl among the crowd, Mr. Hu Boxiang, the initiator of the Love of Domestic Products Movement Committee in this city, issued a statement yesterday, saying: "The Love of Domestic Products Movement, which I proposed at the General Assembly of Members of the Machine Industry Federation on June 15 last year, aims to arouse the psychology of Chinese people to love domestic products, in order to correct the erroneous concept of taking pride in using foreign goods. Those of us who are engaged in national industries hope that domestic industry can develop day by day, and that domestic goods should be given priority whenever they are available. Therefore, the only slogan we proposed at that time was 'It is most honorable to use domestic goods,' which absolutely does not contain any political effect. At that time, we proposed two regulations for this movement: (1) The Love of Domestic Products Movement uses propaganda methods to correct the psychology of taking pride in using non-essential foreign goods. In addition to propaganda, no action should be taken to interfere with or obstruct the freedom of others. (2) The Love of Domestic Products Movement is not a boycott of foreign goods. When promoting propaganda, attention should be paid to avoid confusion. At that time, this proposal was unanimously approved, and it was supported by the Shanghai Association of Domestic Goods Factories, the Shanghai Press Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Branch of the National Industrial Association, the Shanghai Office of the Labor Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Women's Association, the Shanghai Education Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association, and other organizations, as well as various factories and newspapers, to expand propaganda work and remind Chinese people of the psychology of 'loving domestic goods.' The 'Preparatory Meeting for Loving Domestic Goods and Boycotting American Goods' held at the Quan Gung Building the day before yesterday is absolutely unrelated to the Love of Domestic Products Movement Committee initiated by me. I still have great hope for the Love of Domestic Products Movement and am willing to make the greatest effort. However, I hope that our industrial and commercial circles must pay attention to the correct path when launching this movement, so that this movement can spread to the whole country through long-term efforts and struggles, and generate a great effect, and not fall into a wrong path."

### Student Circles are Indignant

[Central News Agency] Since the "Preparatory Meeting for the Movement to Love Domestic Products and Boycott American Products" was convened by the labor circles of this city at the Quan Gung Building the day before yesterday morning, and a bloody conflict suddenly occurred, the Student Federation specially convened a meeting of representatives from various schools at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that the attitude that the student circles should take is as follows: (1) The representatives of various schools all believe that the government authorities cannot shirk their responsibility for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident. According to reports, the municipal government and the police bureau did not make any prior arrangements for the meeting, and after the incident occurred, they failed to stop it in time, allowing the situation to escalate. It is regrettable that they failed to protect the people's assembly. (2) Secondly, the person in charge of the meeting failed to report the meeting location, number of people, and other items to the government in advance to apply for protection, which made it impossible for the police to send personnel to protect it, resulting in the tragedy. The person in charge should be reprimanded by the government. (3) The government authorities should thoroughly investigate the truth of the case, severely punish the principal offenders, investigate responsibilities, and provide compensation to the victimized workers and their families. (4) In the future, the government should try to protect the gatherings of people's organizations and effectively prevent the occurrence of similar incidents. All gatherings of people's organizations should also request government protection in accordance with the law to prevent unscrupulous elements from wantonly disrupting them. The meeting then decided to launch donations from students in various schools to express their condolences to the victimized workers and their families.

### An Old Father Breaks Off an Engagement, a Young Girl Elopes, a Married Man Commits Assault After a Love Affair Fails

[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Zhixu, 27 years old, from Funing, who lives in a shanty in Dapuqiao and works as a rickshaw puller, and his wife Sun Wu, 21 years old, twisted up a woman, Ju Fushi, at around 5:20 p.m. on the 7th and brought her to the Lujiawan Police Station. They claimed that Ju Fushi and her husband, Zhou Renxiang, had beaten them for no reason. According to the plaintiff Sun Zhixu: He claims that on the 25th day of the twelfth lunar month of the year, he became engaged to Wu Zhangbao, the daughter of Wu Shunji, through a matchmaker. The engagement gift was 1 million yuan, of which 400,000 yuan had already been paid. At that time, it was agreed that the wedding would be held on February 6th in the Gregorian calendar. However, due to economic reasons, it was impossible to hold the wedding, so the matchmaker was unable to inform the bride's family of the wedding date. Unexpectedly, Wu Tongbao came to my house on the afternoon of the 5th of this month and eloped to get married. His father-in-law, Wu Shunji, was very angry and led Zhou Renxiang and his wife Zhou Fushi to my house on the afternoon of the same day. Without asking the reason, they punched and kicked us, causing both the newly married couple to be beaten. According to Sun Wu, the assailant Zhou Renxiang had wanted to know her for a long time. Before she married Sun Zhixu, he had pursued her many times, but she knew that he already had a wife, so she strictly refused him. Zhou therefore harbored resentment. This time, she married Sun Zhixu, and her father was very dissatisfied because he disliked Sun for being poor and had wanted to renege on the engagement for a long time. Because she married a chicken and followed the chicken, and married a dog and followed the dog, she firmly opposed it. So, on the day before the wedding, she went to Sun's residence herself and agreed to hold a simple wedding. Her father was even more angry when he heard the news, so on that day, he brought Zhou Renxiang and his wife to her home to commit assault. However, her father did not动手. According to Ju Fushi, she did not participate in the beating and only tried to persuade them from the side. Neighbors proved that she did not take action and had no criminal behavior, so she was released immediately. The injured Sun Zhixu and his wife were sent to the hospital for examination. Because the injuries were minor, they bandaged their heads and were discharged. The police also sent police officers to arrest the fugitive Zhou Renxiang and bring him to justice.

### Gold Shops Raising Prices for Speculation; Central Bank Suspends Distribution in Spring

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Nanjing authorities believe that some member gold shops of the Shanghai Gold Industry Association have lost their original intention by applying to the Central Bank to receive gold and have been suspected of raising prices for speculation. Therefore, yesterday, they specially instructed the Central Bank to temporarily suspend distribution. However, the distribution to the silver shops will continue as usual to meet the actual sales in the stores. The retail prices of each silver shop are still stipulated that each tael must not exceed 20,000 yuan of the Central Bank's distribution price. Yesterday, the Central Bank's distribution price to each silver shop was 562,000 yuan per tael, so yesterday, the listed price of each silver shop was 580,000 yuan per tael.

### Third Temporary Meeting of the Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee

Construction Company Proposes Listing Prices at Any Time; Resolution Submitted to the Municipal Government for Approval

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee held its third temporary meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday.

During the meeting, the representative of the Construction Company proposed that the review of cotton cloth prices was originally based on four items: cotton yarn (raw material), manufacturing, affairs, and other expenses. Now, because the price of goods in this city is fluctuating drastically, the price of yarn is no exception, so the regular price negotiation of cotton cloth has little effect. Furthermore, since the price of yarn is listed by this company at any time, the market price of cotton cloth can be planned and appropriately disposed of by this company to achieve a stabilizing effect. It was resolved to submit it to the Municipal Government for approval.

### Timber Strong

The timber market situation yesterday was encouraging, and the asking prices for foreign pine were inconsistent. Because the producing area raised prices, the market price of fir wood increased.

### Social Bureau Sells More Than 60,000 Bags of Siamese Rice; Rice Grain Black Market Still Rampant; Coarse Grains and Oils See New High Prices

Yesterday, under the cover of buying, the market rose more and more fiercely, and the gold and banknotes soared again. The sales were brisk, and some speculators added fuel to the fire and secretly raised prices. Each commodity saw a new price, and the situation was extremely bad. As follows:

Rice

The source is almost over, only 283 stones of glutinous rice arrived in the two markets. Although the Social Bureau continued to sell 67,700 bags of Saigon No. 2 rice in large quantities, it was still difficult to suppress the black market, and the black market increased sharply by about 20,000 yuan. Outside the market, rice shops are eager to add to the purchase, and the owners regard rice as consignments, asking for prices, and there is no market for a cargo of goods. Informal quotations for each commodity have risen by more than 20,000 yuan, Changshu Jing has reached 115,000 yuan, and Bo Dao and Yang Xian have also reached 110,000 yuan. Early rice then knocks on the 100,000 mark. The speed and size of the increase are really unexpected.

Flour

Only 100 bags of screened No. 2 flour were opened early, priced at 39,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 3,400 yuan compared to the previous market. There were also 200 yuan of Inter Yang flour (100 pounds), priced at 87,000 yuan. After that, the situation was still that demand exceeded supply, and the asking price gradually increased. There was no goods on the market. Until the end of the lunch collection, there was still no opening. Finally, a certain foreign company opened for sale of Canadian Yang flour (150 pounds), and the price was still under discussion, which was 120,000 yuan. Bran is surging, and the document goods kick the ball. Large bags opened at 32,000 yuan, and then rose to 5,000 yuan. Small bags rose from 20,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan. The big one increased by 15%. Wheat has not heard of any transactions.

Cooking oil

Because the raw materials are expensive, the output is not suitable, and the holders are thinking of increasing, so the supply is scarce. The market outside the market is soaring. Lou Sheng oil rose from 220,000 to 235,000 yuan at the close. Barrel Sheng oil rose by 30,000 to 35,000 yuan. Soybean oil also rose by 30,000 yuan. Small cart sesame oil, which is a variety, has a pretty increase, soaring by 5,600 yuan, and the price of clear oil reached the 200,000 yuan mark.

Grains

Each commodity has risen sharply. Yellow soybeans are scarce, and the price has risen by 3,500 yuan. Adzuki beans are mutually accepted by customers, rising by 3,400 yuan. Sesame green beans have all risen. Soybean cake sales are still smooth, and there are also many speculators. If the increase is still there, the sudden jump is 5,000 yuan, while the raw kernel is a sudden jump of more than 20,000 yuan.

### Municipal Government Has Its Own Way to Maintain the City's Food Supply

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Shi Mingqi, chief of the Food and Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, the city has sufficient foreign rice reserves, so there is no need to worry about food. At present, stopping the black market selling of white rice in the city will reduce the price of the producing area. Mayor Wu has his own way to solve the food problem. The Social Affairs Bureau is now sending personnel to work with plainclothes personnel from the Police Department's Administrative Office to severely crack down on the black market. If rice shops are caught, their accounts will be audited first and then transferred to the court for handling. However, most rice merchants are cunning and resourceful. For example, the accounts of Jin Shengchang Rice Mill only have one page, and it is a loose-leaf page.

### Gold Prices in Various Places

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The price of gold in Kyoto fell sharply on the 10th. As of 6:00 PM, the jewelry was sold at 722,000, and the purchase price was 695,000.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 10th] The market in Suzhou City was in chaos today. The listed price of jewelry was 600,000 yuan, and the dark market was approaching the 700,000 mark. White newsprint reached a high point of 150,000 yuan per order. The retail price of white rice broke through the 100,000 mark. The Suzhou Gold and Silver Industry Association specially convened an emergency general meeting, and unanimously decided to wait for the evening market in Shanghai. If the situation is still chaotic, all members will not list prices and close the market on the 11th.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 10th] The price of gold continues to rise, and the market is even more turbulent. Gold shops here are restricted by the city government, and the listed price is still 620,000. In fact, the actual selling price exceeds 700,000 in the name of adding two.

Numbers 49, 145, 198, 14, and 99 were resold, and the off-exchange market was also small. Delivery shares also fell to 112 yuan. At this time, the number of stocks reaching limit-up gradually decreased. However, numbers 219, 28, 188, 179, 79, and 218 actively covered their positions, eventually pushing the prices back near the limit-up level.

A total of more than 500 people, including representatives from various organizations and guests from all walks of life, attended. The meeting was chaired by Professor Zhang Ximan, vice president of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, who gave an opening speech, saying: "Today, we are holding a grand commemorative meeting here to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the death of the great world poet Pushkin. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the staff for their hard work. For the sake of permanent commemoration, our association has donated 1 million yuan in national currency to the Pushkin Memorial Committee as funds for the construction of a bronze statue. Pushkin's life and works have been widely recited by the vast masses of people all over the world, so there is no need to say more. In fact, the name Pushkin in China has become a great name, just like Gorky, Ostrovsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov. I remember ten years ago, with the help of the Commercial Press, our association held a centennial memorial ceremony for Pushkin's death here. The enthusiastic and exciting scene is still vivid today. Ten years later, we are holding another grand commemorative meeting here. We hope that literary workers in China and the Soviet Union will work more closely together to accept Pushkin's literary legacy and his revolutionary spirit." Then, Rogov, the Soviet representative of the Literary Association, delivered a speech, giving a brief introduction to the life and works of the poet, and said: "Countless people all over the world are enthusiastically commemorating Pushkin today, as if they were praising a living person. Pushkin not only lives in the hearts of millions of people in our century, but he will also live forever in countless generations to come." Afterwards, Guo Moruo, a member of the Literary Association, and Fu Shengjing, the representative of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association stationed in China, delivered speeches, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. After the commemorative ceremony, the entertainment program began, including poetry recitations, singing, violin solos, and dance dramas, all of which were famous works by Pushkin. The meeting adjourned at around 5 p.m.

### Many Chinese Scientists Serve as Professors at American Universities: The Weak Scientific Atmosphere in China Leads to the Waste of Talent

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Many scholars studying modern science in the United States from China have recently been invited by American universities to serve as professors, and the number of people is increasing daily. As far as the reporter knows, the professors in the Aeronautics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include Qian Xuesen, Gu Peimu, and Liu Yijin. Zhu Lancheng is a researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the same school. Researchers in the Chemistry Department of the University of Michigan include Fu Ying. Zhang Jin is in the Department of Biochemistry at the same school. Sa Bentie is a researcher in the Biochemistry Department of the University of Utah. Fu Chengyi is a professor in the Department of Geophysics at the California Institute of Technology. Ge Tingsui is a professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago. Wang Qide is a professor in the Department of Aeronautics at New York University. Lin Jiaqiao is a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at Brown University. In addition, there are many others not known to the reporter. Classifying their teaching courses, such as emerging departments such as aviation, if talents can be concentrated in China, a complete department can be established. However, due to the weak scientific atmosphere and the harsh research environment in China, talent is wasted. This situation deserves attention. However, it also shows that China is not lacking in modern scientists. For example, in the list of 250 papers submitted by the US Atomic Energy Commission delegation, there are seven papers by Chinese people, including Zhang Wenyu's "Low-Energy Spectrum of Alpha Emission and the Situation of Beta Emission" and "Radiation Produced by Beryllium," Sun Guanghan's "The Mass of the Neutron," Qian Sanqiang's "Gamma Emission of Radium" and "Precise Organization of the Alpha Emission of Determination," Wang Xianrang's "Estimating the Energy of Heavy Nuclei and Neutron-Proton Pair Combinations Using a New Potential," and Wu Jianxiong et al.'s "Neutron Scattering and the Range of Nuclear Forces." According to reports, Zhang Wenyu is currently a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

### Paying Close Attention to the Shandong Situation Today and in the Future

— Jinan, 5th (Air Mail) Our Special Correspondent, Li Tian

Generally speaking, the main forces of the Communist army are concentrated in three key areas: first, northern Shaanxi; second, the Northeast; and third, Shandong. Due to various factors such as terrain, resources, history, and culture, Shandong is the most resilient of these three key areas. As early as August 8th, this reporter pointed out in an article "Shandong's": Shandong may become the second Jiangxi after the Northern Expedition before the Anti-Japanese War. It will become the most resilient, most powerful, and last base of the CCP. Will the government continue to allow it to grow and create future troubles, or will it take advantage of its initial consolidation and "attack what it must defend"? Based on the current state of affairs, there is no doubt that the government is following the latter path.

### Chen Yi's Troops: A Three-pronged Pincer Movement

The so-called Shandong here, according to the CCP's political divisions, refers to Chen Yi's Shandong Military Region and the Jilu-Yu-Wan Border Region of Liu Bocheng and the Sulu Border Region of Su Yu, which surround it. By the end of last year, the Sulu Border Region, except for the remaining main force of Su Yu's troops in the triangular area north of Ganyu, Hao Pengju's troops, and south of the railway and west of the canal north of Suqian, had largely fled into Shandong. Therefore, the Sulu Border Region can be said to no longer exist in practice.

In January of this year, the Communist army launched an unprecedented offensive in southern Shandong, concentrating six divisions of the New Fourth Army, seven divisions of the Liberation Army, five divisions of the Newly Organized Army, Xu Xiangqian's 115th Division, Liu Bocheng's six columns (six regiments per column), and garrison brigades, independent regiments, militia, etc., totaling no less than 400,000 men, with Xuzhou as their target, and Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng as the commanders, launching a fierce attack on the Nationalist army from southern and western Shandong in a pincer-like offensive. Chen Yi's pincer movement was divided into three routes:

The first route passed through Linyi via Xiangcheng, Lanling, Xia Yixian, occupied Zaozhuang, and then went south to Tengxian to join the Communist army attacking Lincheng.

The second route went south from Linyi to Pixian, and then returned northwest to attack Taierzhuang from the side.

The third route went south from Linyi to seize Tancheng, invade Paoche, cross the Longhai Railway, and join forces with the Communist army gathered north of Suqian at Yaowan. At this point, the Xuzhou-Lianyungang section of the Longhai Railway, which had been opened before the New Year, was breached again.

### Liu Bocheng's Troops: Invade Southwestern Shandong

In addition, Liu Bocheng, known as the "One-Eyed Dragon Little Zhuge" in the Communist army, led a pincer movement from the Jilu-Yu-Wan Border Region, dividing into several groups to the south to southwestern Shandong, taking Chengwu, occupying Dingtao, capturing Caoxian, and invading Shanxian. By the end of January, except for Jinxiang, Jining, Yutai, and Heze, which were still in the hands of the Nationalist army, the entire southwestern Shandong west of the railway and south of the Yellow River had fallen into the hands of the Communist army. Not only that, Liu Bocheng's troops also followed closely, once seizing the Xiaoba station east of Shangqiu by exploiting gaps. At the same time, gunshots were also heard in the vicinity of Yongcheng, Minquan, Mashan, and Zhaoxian southwest of Xuzhou. Zhang Taisheng's troops in the border area of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan also raided Woyang, Haoxian, Luyi, and Zhecheng. Woyang was once occupied by the Communist army in early January, and as a result, the Zhengzhou-Xuzhou section of the Longhai Line was also forced to suspend operations. The situation in Xuzhou became tense.

This was the situation around the Lunar New Year: the Nationalist army held Xuzhou, and the Longhai Railway on both the east and west sides was paralyzed. Although the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway could reach Pukou, the northern section only reached Lincheng. This pincer offensive of the Communist army had clearly achieved some effects of division and encirclement, and was close to succeeding. If this unfavorable situation was not improved, even if Xuzhou could maintain its glorious isolation, Suqian would threaten it one day, and Su North would not be peaceful for a day. If southern and western Shandong were not recovered in a day, the Linji section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway would be hopeless.

### Nationalist Army Strives to Regain Initiative: Communist Army Suffers on Both Front and Rear

The Nationalist army was in this extremely unfavorable position until the Xuzhou-Lianyungang section of the railway was reopened on January 28, Hao Pengju defected, and the last county in northern Jiangsu, Ganyu, was recovered. The threat on the eastern side of Xuzhou was swept away, one of the Communist army's two pincers had been resolved, and the unfavorable situation was gradually reversed.

Subsequently, to gain the initiative, the Nationalist army launched a formal counter-offensive against the Communist army in southern Shandong on February 1. On the afternoon of the same day, Zhang Lingfu's division, formerly under Wang Yaowu, first reported victory, capturing Tancheng. By the 3rd, the unit had crossed the village of Lijiazhuang, 45 li north of the city, and headed straight for the highest command post of Chen Yi, the Shandong Communist Party in Linyi. At the same time, another unit under Hao Pengju had also crossed the Yi River and arrived at the designated location, awaiting orders to advance. The Communist army in Linyi was clearly shaken, and the capture of Linyi could be expected soon. At the same time, the Nationalist army under Huo Shouyi in central Shandong also went south from Boshan and recovered Laiwu on the 4th, attacking the flanks of the Communist army. Undoubtedly, the Communist army had once again turned from an advantageous position at the beginning of the war to a disadvantageous one, and had fallen into a miserable situation where it could not take care of its head and tail and was attacked on both its front and rear.

### Focus of the War: Opening the Tianjin-Pukou Railway

However, the problem must be viewed westward: although the development of the war in southern Shandong has shifted from a disadvantageous to an increasingly favorable situation for the Nationalist army, the threat posed by the harassment of Liu Bocheng's troops in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan to the western side of Xuzhou has not been eliminated for a day, and the Nationalist army in southern Shandong cannot advance north for a day. In addition, due to the limitations of the terrain, the Yimeng Mountains north of Linyi are hilly and difficult to attack but easy to defend. Therefore, even if the Nationalist army settles Linyi, Zhaoxian, and Zaozhuang, it is very likely that it will postpone the northward advance and use its main force to cooperate with the Nationalist army on the periphery of Xuzhou to directly attack the great plain of western Shandong via Jining and Yutai, and then advance northward along both banks of the Grand Canal, directly to the banks of the Yellow River, and then turn eastward to drive the Communist army into the Yimeng Mountains via the Taishan Mountains. In this way, the opening of the Linji section of the railway is truly open, and its safety can be ensured without worry.

This strategic use seems too roundabout on the surface, but in essence, only doing so is most beneficial to the Nationalist army. After the Huayuankou Dam was breached, the Yellow River water has flowed eastward into the sea through the old channel, and this torrential Yellow River, which runs across southwestern Shandong and northeastern Shandong, is like a sharp sword inserted into the chest of the Shandong Communist Party, dividing the Communist army in Shandong into two sections, creating the greatest obstacle to the Communist army's movement and deployment. The Communist army's opposition to the breaching of the Huayuankou Dam is not truly out of love for the few residents of the old Yellow River channel. On the contrary, the Nationalist army should be wary of the Communist army breaching the dikes in the future when the river water is high and the Nationalist army advances, in order to delay the Nationalist army's advance.

Looking at the entire situation as a whole, the war in southern Shandong should temporarily stop with the recovery of Linyi, Zhaoxian, and Zaozhuang. After that, the focus of the war will shift to southwestern and western Shandong until the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is opened. The Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains and the Shandong Peninsula may be temporarily blocked on one side (if they are to be resolved at the same time, it will not be successful unless they are surrounded and attacked from the north, south, and west with overwhelming superior forces). In this way, the Nationalist army advancing north can join forces with the troops advancing south from Tianjin in Cangzhou and open the entire Tianjin-Pukou Railway.

### A Heroic History of the Northern Section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway: 20,000 Soldiers and Civilians in Dingxian Break Through and Retreat North

— Baoding, 1st (Air Mail) Our Reporter in Baoding, Yang Bingsen

On the eve of the Lunar New Year's Eve, the Communist army in Hebei Province launched an offensive on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. After invading Wangdu on the evening of January 20, they split up and attacked Dingxian from the north and south. The defending troops fought hard for eight days, but were eventually outnumbered and Dingxian was captured by the Communist army. More than 20,000 military officers and civilians in the city broke through and retreated north to Baoding. This morning, the reporter went to the Baoding Provincial Hospital to visit Liu Jiaxiu, the wounded magistrate of Anping County, and learned the details of the bloody battle in Dingxian. The sight was shocking and heartbreaking.

Fighting Bitterly for Eight Days and Nights: Resisting 100,000 Communist Troops

The Communist troops launching this offensive on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section were part of Yang Su's column under the command of Nie Rongzhen, who was entrenched in western Hebei, as well as regular troops from various military sub-districts. It was rumored that Liu Bocheng's troops and others totaled about 100,000 men, and they were well-equipped. After invading Wangdu, they successively occupied Qingfengdian, Mingyuedian, Zhaixidian, Xinle, Dongchangshou, and other important strongholds, and implemented an encirclement war against Dingxian with more than 30,000 main force troops.

Dingxian was an important town in the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Before the war, it was a first-class model county in Hebei Province. Mr. Yan Yangchu had been running civilian education here for many years, and the literary atmosphere was strong. The city wall was 40 li in circumference, and it was known for its production of duck pears and pine pepper wine.

On the evening of January 20, after Wangdu fell, Dingxian urgently dispatched two companies of reinforcements to the north to meet them. They were ambushed by ten times the number of Communist troops, resulting in the annihilation of the entire army. The Communist forces took advantage of the situation to rush south, destroying the Nationalist army's bunkers between Qingfengdian and Dingxian, and then surrounding the station and launching a fierce defensive battle in the suburbs.

The two armies fought to the death for several days and nights. On the 27th, the Communist army continued to increase by more than 30,000 men from the side of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, approaching the city and capturing the station. On the morning of the eighth day of the siege (January 28), the Communist army concentrated more than 10,000 troops to attack the southeast corner of the city, firing more than 50 shells without success. Then, they concentrated their efforts to attack the northwest corner of the city, firing more than ten shells, destroying the city wall. The Communist army took advantage of the situation to rush in, and the county town fell.

Only Eight Bullets Left for Each of the 3,000 Defending Soldiers

When the county town was first besieged, all the people in the city hoped that reinforcements would arrive early to relieve the crisis. They especially longed for supplies to be airlifted. The commander, Cui Zixin, commissioner of the Ninth District of Hebei Province, sent several telegrams to Baoding for assistance, which shows the urgency of the situation.

The Communist army's artillery fire became increasingly fierce. It was not until the more than 3,000 defenders in the city were only able to get eight bullets each that they received the order on the 27th that the aircraft would not provide air support and that they should use a red cloth on the west side of the city as a signal for delivery. At that time, they were already surrounded on all sides and were in the most dangerous stage. Moreover, the reinforcements going north from Shijiazhuang were blocked and could not advance, and Xinle had also fallen. The overall situation was lost, and it was too late to save it.

Cries of Women and Children Shook the Sky During the Breakthrough

At noon on the 28th, after the Communist army invaded the county town, about 20,000 military officers and civilians in the city fled to the outside of the city. At that time, the supreme commander, Mr. Cui Zixin, issued an order to cover the retreat. Therefore, the armed personnel reorganized their guns and prepared to break through.

The Communist army speculated that the defending troops would break through and retreat towards Shijiazhuang, so the artillery fire in the north was particularly fierce, as dense as raindrops. The personnel breaking through the encirclement temporarily decided to retreat towards Baoding. More than 20,000 people were ambushed by the Communist army for the first time more than ten miles north of the city, suffering heavy casualties. The cries of the old, young, women, and children shook the sky, which was unbearable to hear.

Commissioner Cui's Last Words Before Martyrdom: Comrades, Advance!

When crossing the first difficulty, night had fallen. The entire team bypassed the side of Wangdu County and continued to advance north, but the Communist army was boundless along the way, and it was impossible to move an inch. They were ambushed everywhere, retreating and advancing, and were at a loss. When passing through Liutun, west of Wangdu County, they were surrounded by more than 10,000 Communist troops, and were on the verge of despair. Under the sweeping of the Communist army's machine guns, most of them died again. Commissioner Cui Zixin suffered several major injuries, but still endured the pain and shouted: "Comrades and compatriots, please break through and advance quickly!" At that time, the Communist army came from all directions. Mr. Cui, unwilling to be captured by the enemy, took advantage of the guards' lack of vigilance and committed suicide. Jia Jichuan, the magistrate of Dingxian County, also died in the line of duty. By the night of the 29th, military and civilians continued to arrive in Baoding. The authorities are now providing shelter and striving to make appropriate follow-up decisions.

### Guangdong Province Actively Launches Five-Year Construction Plan; First Phase Determined to Commence This Year

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng of this Newspaper, Guangzhou Airmail Dispatch on the 4th —

The Guangdong Province Five-Year Construction Plan, drafted over eight months and discussed by over two hundred participating experts, has been finalized. It has been decided that the first phase of the plan will commence this year, with its core focus on developing production sectors. This news is truly a blessing for the thirty-five million people of Guangdong.  Having been occupied for over seven years during the war, with more than two-thirds of the province under enemy control, all prosperous areas suffered severely from enemy and puppet forces' devastation, making reconstruction and development the urgent priority, the most crucial task to fundamentally resolve the province's people's livelihoods.

Guangdong is a province that cannot produce enough food to feed itself. Therefore, in terms of construction, increasing agricultural production should be the top priority of the entire construction effort, followed by the restoration of transportation.  The current difficulties in transportation are sufficient to affect the development of all industries. Therefore, after the restoration, the provincial government should actively undertake farmland water conservancy projects under the principle of "seeking restoration through consolidation and seeking construction through restoration" to increase food production. At the same time, it should urgently repair roads to connect the arteries of society. In the past year, the Guangdong construction authorities have focused on this as their central task and have achieved considerable results, which is a solid foundation for building a new Guangdong.

Water Conservancy Projects, Surveys, and Designs

Firstly, regarding farmland water conservancy construction, under the active promotion of the authorities, forty-six local water conservancy associations and two hundred and twenty-nine irrigation production cooperatives were established in the province. Two survey teams and ten surveying teams were dispatched to be responsible for surveying and designing various water conservancy projects.  Of these, the survey of Manghua, Wenquan, and nine other districts, covering an area of 272,500 mu, with hydroelectric power of 3,500 horsepower, has been completed. Surveying of sixteen districts, including the Huaxian Irrigation District, covering a total area of 244,000 mu, with hydroelectric power of 67,000 horsepower, and drainage channels of 40 kilometers, has been completed. The design of irrigation projects in twelve districts, including Meixian, covering a total area of 263,500 mu, with hydroelectric power of 400 horsepower, has been completed. The Yaoming Shisanwei flood prevention project, benefiting 120,000 mu of farmland, and 1,060 small-scale water conservancy projects such as ponds, canals, embankments, and irrigation ditches completed in various counties, have been completed.

In addition to the above, the Huayang Ma'anwei, Qujiang Fengwan Water and Laozhai Reservoir, and Dongguan Huaide Township irrigation projects are currently under construction. Among them, the largest project, the Huiyang Ma'anwei project, currently mobilizes over ten thousand people to work every day and is expected to require more than a hundred sunny days to complete. Once completed, it will benefit over 200,000 mu of farmland and increase rice production by over 400,000 dan. After the completion of the water conservancy projects in Qujiang and Dongguan, over 30,000 mu of farmland will also benefit. Once these projects are completed, they will greatly contribute to solving the food problem in Guangdong Province.

Conscripting Labor to Repair Roads, Rewarding Private Operation

Regarding transportation, the construction authorities first focused on urgently repairing roads. Before the war, there were 14,518 kilometers of roads in Guangdong Province. However, much of it was destroyed during the war, and only 417 kilometers remained when the war ended.  Restoring all roads to their pre-war condition was estimated to cost over 300 billion yuan, a figure that the provincial authorities could not afford. Therefore, the authorities established two methods: first, conscript labor in various counties to repair roads, using national compulsory labor and calculating its value to give shares to protect their labor interests; second, reward private road rights holders to repair their original road sections and protect their road rights. Under the implementation of these two methods, significant results were achieved. It is estimated that the Guangshao, Guangjiu, ShaoXiao, Guanxing, ZhanShi, and Guanghua lines, with a total length of 5,180 kilometers, have been urgently repaired and opened to traffic. At the same time, the two major trunk lines in the southeast of the province, from Guangzhou to Shantou and from Guangzhou to Meilu, are now being actively repaired. It is estimated that the Guangzeng Highway on the eastern line, which is 75 kilometers long, has already been repaired and opened to traffic. The remaining 448.5 kilometers from Zengcheng to Shantou is under construction. The Guangyun Highway and other roads on the southern line, with a length of 186.5 kilometers, have been repaired and opened to traffic. The roadbed of Hualian Road and other roads, with a total length of 198.4 kilometers, has been repaired. The new road and other roads, with a total length of 1,090.1 kilometers, are under construction. These two major trunk lines are being built by the Guangdong Construction Department, which received 3,400 tons of disaster relief rice from the Guangdong Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to employ laborers to build the roads as a form of work relief. It is expected that they will all be completed and opened to traffic before the two seasons this year.

Industrial Crisis, Urgent Solution Sought

In terms of industry, due to the dumping of foreign goods and rampant smuggling, private industries have suffered a setback. The authorities have addressed the practical problems and solved some difficulties for them. The provincial factories are also being gradually restored. The factories that have resumed operation include the Xicun Cement Factory, Beverage Factory, Ice Factory, Brewery, Textile Factory, and Shunde Sugar Factory. The factories being relocated include the Xinyi Ramie Weaving Factory, Lechang Transportation Equipment Factory, Machine Factory, and Printing Factory. The factories preparing to resume operation include the Xicun Sulfuric Acid Factory, Maoming Sugar Factory, and Jieyang Sugar Factory. Among them, the larger-scale Xicun Cement Factory had a daily output of 600 tons before the war. However, after the occupation, part of the machinery was moved to the Northeast, and the rest was damaged. After partially repairing the machinery, it can only produce 200 tons per day for the time being. Recently, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration agreed to allocate a 2,500 KW generator and a soil-making machine, which is expected to restore pre-war production levels in June this year. In addition, Guangdong Province originally had a provincial paper mill, which was also one of the larger paper mills in the country. During the occupation, the enemy dismantled all the machinery and shipped it to Hokkaido, Japan, to set up a factory and start production. The provincial authorities are now asking the central government to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters to ship it back, but there have been no results yet.

Promote Mining, Seek Investment

Secondly, regarding mining, Guangdong Province is very rich in mineral resources. In total, there are more than 1,280 old and new mining areas in the province, covering a total area of over 70,400 hectares. The types of minerals include gold, tin, iron, steel, tungsten, antimony, lead, zinc, manganese, coal, graphite, arsenic, magnetic clay, marble, mica, sulfur, gypsum, asbestos, heavy stone, etc., distributed in more than 70 counties. The first step for the provincial authorities to promote the mining industry is to reorganize the original mining areas. After the reorganization and retention of the mines, efforts will be made to promote them. In order to reward and assist private mining industries, the central government was asked to provide mining loans. The Guangdong Construction Department recently decided to restore the industrial and mining enterprises, including the coal mines of Baziling Gouyadong in Ruyuan, the iron mines of Babao Mountain and Sulfur Mountain in Yingde, the iron mines in Wushiling in Yunfu, the manganese mines of Jinniushan in Hepu and Dazhixu in Fangcheng, the oil shale mines of Gongguanxu in Maoming and Yangjiaoxu in Dianbai, the tungsten-manganese-copper mines in Wengyuan, Shixing, Conghua, Lechang, and Yunfu, the limestone mines in Huaxian, the zinc mines in Qujiang, Lechang, Ruyuan, Yangshan, and other places, and the phosphate mines in the Xisha Islands. Developing these mineral resources is the foundation for establishing a modern industrial base. The authorities have organized several mining area survey teams to conduct general surveys and have determined the mining methods. However, the current problem is probably still the capital for development. Therefore, they are now striving to attract overseas Chinese investment to return to the country, so that the land can be used to its fullest extent and resources can be used to their fullest extent. This will naturally shorten the journey for the construction of a new Guangdong.

### From the Glorious Shipyard to Jilin

— Yongji Airmail Dispatch on the 2nd, Hu Jingwen

Although "Jilin," known as one of the three eastern provinces, has become a historical name, its mountainous embrace, fertile and rich treasures, cannot diminish its value. Fourteen years of exploitation and two severe periods of plunder have thinned this vast territory, but it can regain its strength in the face of difficulties.

"Shipyard" is the old name of Jilin. We cannot forget the meaningful historical fact that in the fifteenth year of the Shunzhi era, warships were built in this place to defend against Russian invasions. Later, it was established as the provincial capital and renamed "Jilin." In the second year of the Republic of China, it was changed to a county. In the nineteenth year, because the province and county had the same name, it was renamed "Yongji."

After the September 18th Incident, "Jilin" was reduced by the Japanese under their control and division due to its topography. Relying on natural gifts and human efforts, the Japanese gained countless benefits, and the important border town once again took on the central task, forming the active blood artery of the Northeast.

After the restoration of the territory, the government divided the Northeast into nine provinces and two cities to meet the requirements of politics, economy, military affairs, and geography. Thus, "Jilin," which had experienced many changes, took on a new appearance.

Blood Transfusion Road

The only means of transportation in Jilin City, apart from the rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages found in other cities, is the bus that runs from the railway station to the front of the provincial government. However, this seems to be "nominal only," because you often wait half a day without seeing the shadow of a bus, which has led to a booming horse-drawn carriage business. According to locals, "In the past, the Japanese devils not only allocated special vehicles properly, but also completed the main urban trunk lines, and traffic was very convenient through Linjiangmen to Jilin Normal University, the highest institution of learning."

The three railway trunk lines that control the lifeline of "Jilin," namely Jichang, Jihai, and Jidun, are now only possible with Jihai and Jichang, except for those controlled and destroyed by the Communist army. However, Jihai is only able to travel to the Meihekou Station due to the stagnation of the Dunhai Line.

The Jichang Road is 127.741 kilometers long and is already thirty-six years old this year, which is the prime of its life. The main stations along the line are Huapichang, Tumenling, and Xiajiutai. They are also commercial centers connecting Jilin and Changchun. In order to protect this blood transfusion artery of Jichang, the government has sent many brave National Army soldiers along the line and built many bunkers, providing many conveniences to the military and civilians.

The Jichang Highway, which winds for 240 li, has been completed with difficulty. Daily buses have also provided some assistance to the people, allowing Jilin to breathe a sigh of relief from the silence and exhaustion of the traffic congestion period.

Cultural Circle

Due to its past location on the border, there were few intellectuals coming and going, which gave "Jilin" a corrupt and rigid form. Although the country had spent a lot of money here to build schools and cultivate talents, it was still relatively backward. Unfortunately, it later suffered from the ravages of the Japanese, and the damage and poisoning were even deeper.

Since the government recovered "Jilin," it has successively raised the banner of educating people, sweeping away the decadent academic atmosphere of the past, restoring the academic system, respecting practical learning, cultivating teachers, improving education, expanding primary schools, establishing mass education centers, changing ideas, completely eradicating illiteracy, and establishing youth supplementary classes to remedy the absurd and ignorant education of the enemy puppets. Newspapers that lead the people's wisdom have also taken root like bamboo shoots after a rain. There are Changbai, Jilin, and other newspapers established. With so many circles for cultivating the people, it will not be difficult for Jilin's culture to catch up. However, if we look at the teaching equipment in the highest institution of learning, "Normal University," we may be disappointed again!

There is a place fifteen li outside Linjiangmen in Xiguan, Jilin, called Babailong. In the vast square, there are several buildings built of stone, which are the National Changbai Normal College.

After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese established "Jilin Shidao University" here. At that time, there were only two or three hundred students, and the school buildings were still sufficient. Now the number of old and new students has exceeded five hundred, and they are still attending classes in the two side halls and still eating and living in one dormitory, which cannot help but worry many students.

New Outlook

"Jilin" does not bear the great hope of Shenyang and Changchun, but if we look at the topography, we cannot ignore it. It has the responsibility of being a defensive barrier on the east side, and it is also a major town in the political center of the east side. It is also a commercial hub in Jidun and Jitong in the east. Even Changchun, which was once called the capital, is not relying on its supply?

If we further examine its own situation, then please look at the internal situation. Due to its naturally endowed mountainous form, it has a large production of ginseng, timber, soybeans, soybean oil, bean cakes, rice, wheat, fungus, astragalus, and other plants. In terms of animals, mink, bears, foxes, horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, etc. also breed in large numbers. According to the statistics on wasteland in the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, there are as many as 9,096,357 mu. From this vast number, it can be seen that there is much land waiting to be reclaimed. For the sake of economic prosperity and increased production, we should do our best to cultivate and cultivate, turning barren land into fertile fields and barren mountains into forests. Under the slogan of building everything, if we can weave the traffic lines into a traffic network, then the future Jilin will have endless hope!

### Is Your Child a Prodigy? Problems with Children's School Enrollment

— Du Yun

Recently, news of the discovery of "prodigies" has been frequently seen in newspapers. There is one in Guangxi, one in Jiangsu, some recognizing characters at the age of one, reading texts at the age of two, writing characters at the age of three, composing essays at the age of four, and writing poems at the age of five, etc. Whether it is true or false is secondary. However, how many parents are envious, thinking that they have been blessed with a gifted child. Regardless of this atomic age, it is not about superstition or feudal thinking, but the pursuit of knowledge for children's enrollment is also a problem worthy of discussion. The author has served in elementary education for more than ten years and has some insights into this issue. I dare to offer some opinions for the reference of parents.

Bai Juyi recognized the characters "zhi" and "wu" at the age of seven months, which is not uncommon. The author's deceased son could also recognize the character "shang" at the age of six months. Although he was smarter than ordinary children, it was a sign of a short life. Because children's intelligence is limited, parents should protect their brainpower and not overexert it. Often, some parents teach their children to recognize characters when they are babbling, and even boast that their children can recognize hundreds of characters at the age of five. In fact, it is no different from injuring the children's brainpower and destroying their lives.

People's intelligence and foolishness are innately different, but there are those who are relatively clever and relatively dull, and very few who are extremely clever and extremely foolish. Therefore, some parents enroll their children too early, but their grades are poor and they appear to be mentally slow, thinking that they are not worthy of being educated and feeling quite disheartened. This is also unnecessary. Because some people's knowledge opens early, and some people's knowledge opens late. It is often seen that some children have excellent grades at the age of seven or eight, and their test scores are always at the top of the list; however, they regress when they enter middle school. This is because they overused their brains in their childhood. It is also possible that they become foolish like Jiang Lang after his talent has been exhausted. However, there are also those whose grades are low at the age of seven or eight and whose test scores are at the bottom of the list; but they make rapid progress when they enter middle school. This is because their intelligence is just beginning to open and they are trying their hand for the first time. Therefore, parents should pay attention to their children's intelligence and should not expect too much from them or supervise them too strictly.

Wang Bo wrote the Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng, which was full of talent and made him famous with one preface, but he ended up with a short life. In the early Republic of China, Xu Xue'er became the chief writer of a newspaper at the age of less than twenty. His writing was outstanding and his pen was omnipotent, but he did not live long either. It can be seen that people's intelligence is limited after all. Like a tank of water, the first to draw is the first to dry up. As parents, there is no need to hope that their children will be prodigies. Even the problems of children recognizing characters and enrolling in school should be considered according to their age!

According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, the age of children's school enrollment is qualified at the age of six in elementary school, and entering kindergarten two years earlier has its principles. Now that the start of the school year is approaching, some parents are eager to send their children to school, and they cannot but consider the age issue. If they are not yet six years old, it is better not to send them to school and only send them to kindergarten.

However, it should be mentioned in passing! Some schools have so-called preparatory classes, which do not have formal lessons and only serve to muddle along; while parents think that their children are noisy at home and may as well go to "guan man" [term for children being rowdy]. In fact, children are lively and active, and being noisy is their nature. If they say "guan man," how can they treat children as criminals? Parents should not expect too much from their children, but if they implement "guan man" and depress their ambition and receive abnormal education, it will make him feel that school is uninteresting. As a result, as he grows older, he lacks the desire to study and has a bad impression. Perhaps he was originally a genius but was injured.

### Also Discussing Blind Nipples

— Quan

On February 4th, the newspaper captured, Mr. Lan, [疑: I doubt] "Sheng Yan's ancient medical method for nipples," cannot help but be skeptical, I have to make some more additions, fortunately, I am for the discussion of the truth, I think Mr. [疑: Lan] will not mind.

The so-called blind nipples are probably the nipples that are flat and inverted, making it difficult for infants to suck. This is a common phenomenon among primiparas. Although incomplete development of the mammary glands is one reason, the tight clothing during pregnancy and lack of attention are the biggest causes. We should know the magic of creation and not doubt it. When a woman is pregnant, due to the relationship of endocrine stimulants, the mammary glands will naturally develop, preparing to make food for the baby, and at the same time, the nipple pigment increases and the brown color deepens. Before giving birth, primiparous women should often wash their nipples with clean water or diluted alcohol, and gently pick them with their fingers, so that the nipple's blood circulation is good and the local development is complete, and so that the tissue is soft, so as to avoid pain, peeling, or milk accumulation, swelling, and pain, suppuration, and other pains when the infant sucks after delivery.

If you have not taken such precautions, and you cannot suckle after delivery, you should still use corrective methods to remedy it, that is, warm washing, warm compresses, and twisting, and then let older children or adults gently suck it with their mouths. Huangqi Rougui Angelica and other medicines are tonics and have the effect of promoting milk secretion, and their function cannot be obliterated. If they are used for those with weak constitutions and insufficient milk and flat breasts, they will naturally be very effective. If they are used for those with flat nipples that cannot suckle, resulting in breast swelling and pain, I am afraid that they will not achieve the expected results. Mr. Wen's experience probably belongs to the former, and I hope readers will distinguish it. (In response)

### Adapt to Your Age

— Gang Ren

Here is a sentence that can be hung forever next to a woman's mirror, giving her mistress a reminder every day: "Adapt to your age!"

These short seven words already include all the principles and methods for a woman to maintain her moving posture forever; but too few women believe it, they are only obsessed with the idea that youth is the most important thing for a woman. So they think they are already withered when they are still far from aging.

This puts women in a pair of sad glasses, even though they have rich knowledge to determine what era she is in; but in their opinion, not dressing up like her daughter and making every effort to cover up her age cannot show her beauty.

Age is relentlessly summoning, bringing the appearance of old age. A woman cannot use special cosmetics or drugs to transform her old age, just as she cannot make youth last forever.

That's the saddest thing. She is only wandering in the wrong path of finding youth, sad and troubled, and neglecting the avenue she should take.

Age is only an insurmountable enemy when you fight him stubbornly and blindly; if you can adapt to him, he may be a good friend.

There are many middle-aged women who are as beautiful and moving as girls, because they can adapt to her age and her era, and give full play to the good beauty points under skilled and balanced methods.

It is impossible to make a woman in her thirties or forties as sweet as an eighteen-year-old girl; and it is the most foolish thing to try to beautify her face with cosmetics.

A beautiful, elegant, and peaceful face belongs to women of that era; a lively and innocent demeanor belongs to women of those ages and cannot be interchanged. An era is a kind of beauty.

Only those women who create trouble for themselves, resolutely deny her era, and go on the wrong path, abandoning the beauty of her youth when she is young, and dressing up as a girl and making coy actions and all the movements of young people when she is older; no one will not find her ugly, right?

She ignores a method that can be successful, whether it is her beauty or the relationship between husband and wife, it is always a woman who can adapt to her age and develop her personality. The most can be maintained.

Know that women in every period have their own specific personality and specific beauty; to have truly eternal beauty, you must face reality and adapt to your own age! (This article is based on Ms. Diss's "Be Your Age")

### Using the Economic Oil Stove

— Gui Yan

After the victory, kerosene oil flowed in from the United States, so the fuel used by the people in major trading ports was mostly supplied by it.

The "economic oil stove," which was invented before the war, should also be revived today. However, in the past decade or so, the Chinese have not yet manufactured it to meet insurance standards, so fires often occur as a result.

Based on my years of experience using this type of oil stove, I would like to specifically list several key points that can avoid disasters before the oil stove is thoroughly improved, in order to reduce some potential hazards. At the same time, I hope that the manufacturers can also make comprehensive improvements based on what I have written below.

Nine out of ten accidents with economic stoves are due to the bursting of the lower oil storage container. Because this storage container is made of copper, probably due to cost considerations, it is not formed from a single piece, but is soldered at the joints with tin. Therefore, it cannot withstand long-term heat, which is transmitted to the bottom layer, and the tin gradually melts. The storage container then disintegrates on its own, causing the oil to spill out and come into contact with the fire, making it impossible to control.

However, users must not panic. If there is an empty lead bucket nearby, quickly cover it over the stove. Or cover it with a quilt, which can also extinguish the flames. Yellow sand is even better, as it can completely extinguish the fire. However, using water seems to be the least effective method.

To prevent the oil storage container from bursting, the burning time should be controlled. In summer, it should be used for a maximum of two hours, and it should be stopped when the oil container becomes hot. In winter, it can be used for up to three hours. Although the manufacturer's instructions say that kerosene can be added while burning, it is best not to add oil in the middle of burning, for the sake of caution. If it is absolutely necessary to add oil, the fire should be extinguished before adding it. Also, the user must not walk away while burning the stove. Be careful not to let the oil burn dry. Because if it burns dry, the heat expands and it is easy to cause the bottom of the stove to desolder. Although it may not lead to a disaster, it will cause the upper cylinder to bear the brunt of high heat destruction, and the wicks below will become mostly charred, which is uneconomical.

Because the three iron frame pillars of this stove are inserted into the oil storage container itself, the supporting force is naturally very limited. Therefore, do not add overly heavy pots or similar items, because I have heard that some accidents have occurred because the three pillars could not bear the load, causing the solder of the oil storage container to crack, and then the flames rushed downwards, immediately causing danger.

When extinguishing the fire, the pressure-adjusting cylinder must first be removed with a metal pry bar. (The metal pry bar is an accessory of the stove.) Then gently fan upwards from under the stove with a fan (do not blow with your mouth) to safely extinguish the fire without any kerosene smell. If you extinguish the fire by turning the wick control knob while the cylinder is still on top, the foul odor will take nearly half an hour to dissipate. It will invade food and objects, and it will be impossible to remove it for a while.

During use, if the fire is uneven or too low, it will emit smoke and a bad odor. Use a metal pry bar on the four small hooks on the side of the pressure-adjusting cylinder, holding it and rotating it as much as possible until the flames are even, and then the above problems will disappear.

Finally, I must tell the housewives who use this product that they must keep it clean, and the remaining oil stains on the outside of the oil storage container should be wiped off in particular.

### Wife Wanted

— Translated by Cheng Zhi

If your wife suddenly disappears and you decide to place an advertisement to find someone to replace her, then your wording would probably be like this: "Woman wanted to assist with household chores, working seven days a week, eighteen hours a day, must live in. Must be proficient in cooking, sewing, medicine, children's health, bookkeeping, basic electricity, and male psychology. Applicants must be physically strong and willing, and it would be even better if they could help with gardening. No wages, but necessities are provided." (Translator's note: "Wife" is originally such a pitiful worker.)

### Lamenting Zhou Zuoren Again

— Zhang Mingchun

During the War of Resistance, whenever someone told me that Zhou Zuoren was about to become a traitor, I never believed it. Like a volunteer lawyer, I always defended him, saying: "Don't worry, although I have never met him, this person will never be a traitor, no matter what. If you ask how I know, it is because I have read his books, know his character, and believe his words." As a result, alas, who knew that the result would be unexpected, and he really went down to the sea!

I do not want to lament any traitors. In fact, there is no traitor worth lamenting. One is one, two is two. A traitor is a traitor, and there can be no excuses or pretexts. However, I feel sorry for Zhou Zuoren, but dare not speak it.

In the past, I read Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's Lamenting Zhou Zuoren in Zhou Bao issue 19, and I felt quite the same way. I still feel that Zhou has other regrettable aspects. I am writing it down haphazardly to seek correction from those who have read this article.

In terms of Zhou's cultural status, his defection has had a significant negative impact on the psychology of Chinese cultural figures. However, in terms of his evil deeds, it may not amount to a pseudo-village chief's one month of "acting recklessly," a pseudo-military lieutenant's adjutant's one week of "stirring up trouble," or a senior official's one-time acceptance of something that flew in from the sky! Also, looking at his writings after his defection, such as "Talking After the Wind and Rain," "Talking After Holding a Candle," "A Corner of the Study," "Bitter Mouth Sweet Mouth," and "Before the Beginning of Spring," he did not flatter Japan or mock the central government. In his speeches (according to what was published in the Southern puppet newspapers), even the sickening words "Sharing life and death, sharing joys and sorrows," "The country must be unified, the party must not be divided," and "Joining hands with friendly nations to advance together and jointly complete the Great East Asia Holy War" are rarely found. But he was the Director-General of Education in North China, a thorough traitor. For the sake of the future of the country and the nation, he can only be punished. Fourteen years of imprisonment is what he deserves. Zhou also said: "The sentence is too heavy, can painting a cake fill the stomach?" Old sir, you should know that this is already quite polite. "One wrong step" is not the title of a light essay.

Mr. Zheng said: "He later seemed to be lagging behind." Indeed, he was lagging behind, but his remarks did have some wisdom that could be adopted. Now I will give a random example. His proposition that "morality should be made functional, and ethics should be made biological" is very insightful. Regarding the meaning of the latter sentence, he elaborated that there is no classic in the world that can be used as a lesson for mankind for thousands of years. Biological knowledge can be used as a reference for the entire life problem, so as to determine the standard of human behavior. In "Talking About Chinese Thought Problems," he further said that eating to seek the survival of the individual, and men and women to seek the survival of the race, are the instincts of all living things, which evolutionists call will. Humans are also animals, so this instinct is naturally present, but the survival of ordinary organisms is simple, as long as the purpose of survival is achieved, the means are not questioned, and as long as they can survive, they do not hesitate to harm the survival of others. Humans are different. They also require survival like organisms, but at first they feel that they cannot achieve their goals alone, and they must contact others and help each other in order to survive well. Later, they also feel that others have the same likes and dislikes as themselves, and try to get along with each other satisfactorily. The former is the method of survival, which some animals can also do; the latter is the moral of survival unique to humans. The ancients said, "What distinguishes humans from beasts is very little." This is it. Then he said that the highest point of the central idea of the Chinese people is benevolence, which is the development and success of this primitive survival morality. If it is not viewed from the standpoint of biology, the depth of its meaning cannot be understood. These are all very clear and elegant words. I am afraid that his countless similar arguments will be spurned along with his traitorous stigma and gradually disappear with time. The ancient Chinese训 (xùn) "do not abandon words because of people," but the historical facts are just the opposite. Not only are words abandoned because of people, but also other strengths of that person are abandoned. Zhu Yunlin's imitation of Cao Cao's calligraphy was quite criticized by his friends. A disciple of the Huang family in Suzhou, Zhong Mou, wanted to print Yan Gao's Qianshan Hall Calligraphy, but his fellow disciples opposed it to the point of fighting. In Xinghua, there is a large plaque with the three characters "Zhuangyuanjing" written by Yan Shifan. The calligraphy is superb, but later generations removed the inscription because they did not value Yan Shifan, and if it were not for the elders' reminder, they would not know that it was written by a Huai person.

As for Wang Juesi, Ruan Da cheng, and Zhao Wenhua, their personal flaws have all reduced the scope of dissemination of their art and articles that they deserve. Most notably, today Zheng Xiaoxu's calligraphy is ashamed to be hung on the wall; Wang Zhaoming's books are ashamed to be placed on the desk; and the inscriptions and plaques inscribed by Tong Fohai in various schools in Jiangsu have had his name erased. Zhou Zuoren's writings and calligraphy are by no means comparable to those of Wang Zhou and others, but his fate can be imagined. Isn't this something worth our regret?

According to Mr. Zheng's classification of traitors, Zhou Zuoren should belong to the educational and cultural traitors. Educational and cultural traitors, except for Chen Binyin, Yuan Shu, and Shen Qixian, are generally more pitiful than other political, military, and economic traitors. Their lives after becoming traitors are not very affluent, and some are still poor as usual. They are definitely not as capable as traitors in other fields, who can enjoy wealth and glory and swagger through the streets. After the restoration of peace, the first to be reported and criticized are the educational and cultural traitors, because the educational and cultural circles emphasize right and wrong the most and like to comment, and the first to be targeted by pen and tongue are the scum of this circle. This is something that the educational and cultural circles can be proud of, but it is also pitiful. In fact, this type of traitor has a weaker ability to automatically transform; less opportunity to be passively protected; and is very easy to deal with. May I ask what can the cultural people who hold a sense of justice do to those political, military, and economic traitors who have not yet been caught and the traitors who are being protected by powerful people?

Therefore, people in the cultural and educational circles can only remove the thorns in their own eyes, but cannot remove the beams in others' eyes, isn't it very sad!

As for how to deal with Zhou Zuoren, I strongly agree with Mr. Zheng's proposal, which is "to imprison him in a special way, but to make him work, engage in translating Greek literature or something." Zhou Zuoren said in the introduction to his Greek Mythology written in August of the thirty-third year: "When I was young, I liked to dabble in writing. Unexpectedly, I fell into the path of a literati, like a fallen citizen. Even if I wanted to retire, I could not be exempted. Thinking about it makes my heart ache for years. Perhaps a translator can be slightly farther away from the literary world. If I really cannot avoid being a commoner, I might as well change my career from writing to being a translator. It is better for me to do this and complete the translation and annotation of myths, which is my duty, and I should do it first. In addition, there are countless good words and deeds of sages and philosophers in the East and West. I will transcribe them as I have the opportunity, a chapter or half a verse, which is also a Dharma gift." According to this, Mr. Zheng's proposal may be very suitable for Zhou.

### Ninth Sister

— Qin Ling

As the Lunar New Year approached, it rained drizzlingly all day long. The mud was everywhere, and the land was crumpled all over. Amidst the sighs of difficult walking, I gradually approached home. The first feeling upon entering the living room was an unbearable emptiness. The sky was too dark; the living room, which was shaded by the wooden building, was even more dim. In the past, whenever I ran in, Ninth Sister, who always sat in the corner of the living room, would always call out softly, "Sister." But today her voice was gone, and only a chair lay silently in the corner.

I ran upstairs, calling out "Mom," but there was no answer. My younger brother tiptoed out of the study.

"Where's Mom?"

"She's sick and lying inside."

"Where did Ninth Sister go?"

"She's dead..."

"Dead?"

That pale, sickly little face immediately floated up in my tears. Ninth Sister was unfortunate to be born in this era of suffering. In the first year of the incident, she fled to the countryside with her nanny, completely isolated from the family. When we returned to our hometown and took her back to the city, Ninth Sister was already suffering from spinal TB. In this way, bad luck followed her continuously for nine years.

We were a family with many children. When parents felt overwhelmed by taking care of too many children, the children also suffered pain and made mistakes due to being neglected. This was truly a complex little society, where the strength and weakness of abilities were clearly displayed in competition. Therefore, Ninth Sister gradually developed the habit of being lonely and withdrawn. She did not like to quarrel. When the older brothers gathered together to play, she always watched silently. Sometimes she would show a little smile for their joy, but soon the gloom would cover her again. Even if Mom and Dad always protected her, she was still inevitably secretly bullied by the boys. As a result, her character had the melancholy of an adult. She was a very stubborn girl. She cried softly when she was bullied by others, but when we approached, she would wipe away her tears and remain silent. Even if we tried our best to ask her why she was crying, she would always ignore us. Because her loneliness lost the love of her family, and because of the lack of warmth from her family, she became even more lonely. In this way, she became increasingly estranged from us. But even though we were relatively estranged, we never expected that the last time I returned home would be the last time we met. That day her face was a little swollen, but her spirit was still good. She lay on a stool and folded paper rabbits by herself. Half a month later, we were separated forever.

On this rainy evening, I returned home and no longer saw her lonely and worried little face. Even the coffin had been buried early because the New Year was approaching. Apart from the few old little toys that Mom had packed up for her and the chair in the corner, there were no traces left. She quietly took everything that belonged to her away.

Living in this era of suffering is not happiness. Living one more day is just suffering a little more calamity and a little more torment. But she lived too short after all, only eleven years! Not long after entering the world, she had to bear extremely severe pain and let it torment her to death. In her life, there was no sunshine, no laughter. When she closed her little eyes, did she hate the world and hate people? Mother was sick because of her death. Although there were many children, she always felt sorry for her. The older brothers also shed tears of remorse today because of their past bullying. They asked me in a low voice, "Does Ninth Sister hate us now?"

She lies alone in the ancestral grave in × village. In the mournful winter wind, the cemetery is desolate and lonely. Will she frown her little face because of these cold scenes?

### Small Window

— Su Dan

No green ivy, no exquisite window screen, no purple velvet curtains, but blue sky, white clouds, night stars and moon embellish this gray-brown small window. Don't laugh at my poverty, my small window is resplendent.

Whenever I am lonely, be it dusk or night, I always silently face this small world. At this time, those long-forgotten colorful memories arouse my intimacy again. Many memories, many dreams, those hazy feelings secretly weave into some images, beautiful and dazzling me!

Now I live in loneliness and am dazzled by the memories of the past. Those images, the countless fragments of colorful dreams, are indeed magnificent, but when stacked up, they are also a heavy burden! But don't just dislike its heaviness, it will also give a little joy of suffering, some humorous smiles... Therefore, sometimes I forget that inexplicable heaviness and love that bit of colorful splendor.

The small window has given me too much fantasy. It is when I am silently facing the small window alone that it makes me reminisce about the brilliant past, like a spider that has formed a web, and then follow the old tracks back, slowly and carefully appreciating the past joys and sorrows in the course of life. Although memory is dazzling me, I don't boast about the richness and luxury of memory (of course, there are also hardships and tears). On the long road of life, I have only walked a short distance. Now I am temporarily resting on the side of the road, just trying to relieve some slight panting. I sit in front of my small window and let my soul have a moment of rest.

Staying here, however, has boundless loneliness, but I thank the small window for the warmth it gives. I silently accept this bit of grace, like a traveler resting, looking back at the road I have traveled, somewhat comforted. In loneliness, I am holding this mood, reviewing the dreams of youth, but in this journey I have not lifted a single flower or grass, empty. Someone should laugh at my poverty!

Really, except for this small window, except for the sunlight of memory that this small window gives me, I have nothing. I have lost my childhood and innocence, lost everything. No, I still have a bit of wisdom left, and with this, I can still appreciate the tenderness of this small window.

I cherish those lost years, and cherish the future even more. I love this gray-brown small window.

### Guanyin Temple Fair – Yang Zhou Continued Dreams Nine

— Hong Weifa

Ping Shan Hall in northwest Yangzhou is a scenic area for excursions. Guanyin Mountain, close to Ping Shan Hall, is a place for incense and worship of Buddha. Every year, from the first day of the sixth lunar month to the nineteenth day, there is a regular temple fair. During these dozen days, there are particularly many devout men and women who come to offer incense. Along the river at the foot of the mountain, large and small tourist boats come and go like weaving, mostly carrying the pilgrims. There are also those who do not take boats and follow the land route, so there are also many pilgrims on the shore coming and going. From the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, reed sheds are built on both sides, selling incense and candles, or buying toys, or selling food, which are both colorful and have everything. Offering incense is originally a matter for adults, but children want to follow to see the excitement, which is exactly seizing the opportunity. When children arrive at Guanyin Mountain, they want to eat the food they see, and they want the toys they see. They pester and cry, finally making the adults unable to avoid loosening their purse strings and spending money to buy a little. Therefore, the general people who sell things think of various ways to tease the children and increase their desire to buy.

This temple fair is most lively after the fifteenth day. The nineteenth day is the birthday of Guanyin. After this day, the mountain gate is closed, and it suddenly becomes deserted. Thinking about it now, the two things that are most memorable during the past temple fair period are the following. The first thing is that on the night of the eighteenth, the North Gate and Tianning Gate are mostly not closed all night. The people offering incense leave the city at dusk. A boat sways slowly towards Guanyin Mountain. After offering incense, they can return if they want, or stay in the boat if they don't want to, and sail to the Slender West Lake to see the moonlit lakes and mountains. It is good to sing a song, or to compose a few poems, or to joke and boast. By the next morning, they re-enter the city in the morning breeze and waning moon. In addition, there are also young people or famous scholars who take advantage of this good night to bring singers and gather in the boats around Guanyin Mountain, striking the deck, drinking from golden goblets, guessing punches, and enjoying themselves all night. The boats are lit with gasoline lamps, which look like bright planets from afar, reflected in the water, shimmering, and even more like blooming silver flowers.

Another thing is that during the temple fair, many young students give open-air speeches at the foot of the mountain, trying their best to promote the abolition of superstition. Although there are few listeners, the speakers are still earnest. This situation was especially intense during the May Fourth Movement. There are also Christian missionaries who spread the gospel at the foot of the mountain, persuading people not to believe in clay and wood idols. Because they are the children of God, they hope that everyone is the children of God. This seems to be a blow to the monks in the temples of Guanyin Mountain, but the incense is still very prosperous. Therefore, they also follow the spirit of compassion of the Buddha and are generous to those who oppose them, except for chanting a few Amitabha Buddha.

However, this temple fair declined after the War of Resistance. By the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, it was just right to restore the grand view, but due to the unrest of Huafu, troops were stationed on the mountain, and people offering incense could not freely enter and exit. The monks also wanted to invite Guanyin down the mountain to be worshipped by devout men and women at the foot of the mountain, but due to the special circumstances, it was impossible to reverse the decline. It made another Guanyin receive unexpected offerings. Originally, beside the Five Pavilion Bridge, there was a private villa owned by the Chen family, called Yu Zhuang. Under the riverside rocks, there is a white stone Guanyin. Usually, the green bamboo reflects it, and tourists passing by this place on a boat will often have the fantasy of reaching the other shore. Since the turmoil, the houses of Yu Zhuang have collapsed, and the Guanyin statue has been exposed to wind and rain. I don't know which believer moved Guanyin to the nearby Lianxing Temple. Thus, the past Guanyin Mountain temple fair also followed to Lianxing Temple. For a time, this white stone Guanyin was greatly worshipped by devout men and women, and the incense was prosperous, far from being comparable to just watching the passing tourists when it was left in Yu Zhuang. Some people say that Guanyin in various places must also rely on fate. It seems that Guanyin on Guanyin Mountain has had a lot of fate in the past ten years.

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 165

— Ye Jingfeng

"The captain has already planned it out": Yaoqun replied, the captain being Mr. W, "People, ammunition, equipment, all are ready, just waiting for us to launch here."

Upon hearing this, I felt relieved and truly admired Mr. W's decisiveness; unlike other Chinese organizations, where even a small matter, like requesting a few sheets of draft paper or a few ounces of tea leaves, would go through several rounds of criticism and reprinting, and whether it would be approved was still uncertain. A public document coming out was like a performing actress, first scrutinized behind the curtain, and even after being approved, it would still move slowly, taking three steps forward and three steps back, making a big show of it, only stepping forward when the gongs and drums urged her on.

Tsurumi was quietly listening to my conversation with Yaoqun, his eyebrows relaxed, but his eyes were staring blankly. I was afraid he had too many thoughts and couldn't sort them out, so I briefly explained his secret mission and our plan to establish an office in Shanxi.

"Old brother, don't worry that I don't understand": Tsurumi seemed to be teasing me; "These things, they churn in my mind several times every hour, how could I not understand what you two are discussing?"

"Correct!" Little Tiger suddenly shouted, like an audience member cheering at a play; but I didn't understand what his "correct" referred to, or what the target was.

"It's not a problem at all." Tsurumi nodded at Little Tiger, acknowledging his support, and continued, "My finances now have another source, provided by the old man, use it as you see fit. Equipment is even less of a problem, just pick the best and ask me for it. Only the 'people' issue, that will require Miss Yao and the little teacher (Pi Hucheng) to put in some effort." The "old man" he referred to was Konoe.

"Correct!" Little Tiger cheered again, "No... I mean, regarding 'people,' we can move some from the prisons, ask my uncle, he can't refuse. Anyway, they're all fighting the Japanese devils."

"Correct!..." Tsurumi also saw Hucheng's support. "But I'm very surprised," Tsurumi looked directly at me, "How have the young ladies become so formidable!" As Tsurumi said this, his cheeks flushed slightly. "I mean, Shanxi, that place is quite annoying. If you asked me to go, I wouldn't be willing; the place is remote, the transportation is difficult... and there are those Red Spears and Black Spears!... "

I now understood why Tsurumi was staring blankly, he was considering Yaoqun's situation from her perspective, and from his tone, he seemed to admire Yaoqun's courage.

The telephone rang, and Yaoqun picked up the receiver again;

"Japanese." She looked at me disappointedly.

Tsurumi took the receiver, nodded to Yaoqun, bowing so low it was almost a bow, and repeatedly said "Thank you."

"Can you all guess who called?" Tsurumi hung up the receiver after the call and turned to ask us. When he answered, he only hummed a few "good" sounds, in Japanese. It was difficult to guess without any basis.

"Matsui?" I guessed from the Japanese.

Tsurumi burst into laughter, laughing so innocently.

"You really wouldn't guess, it was our 'Fourth Brother'. He also went to the garrison branch; asking their military headquarters to send someone to pursue Mr. Ao as well. I think this move is excellent, I just couldn't think of it myself." The "Fourth Brother" he mentioned was "Number 04."

### Glory Belongs to Humanity: Centennial Memorial of Edison's Birth

— ·Xin·Er

On April 12, 1861, a civil war broke out in the United States: the famous American Civil War. At that time, Edison was fourteen years old. This young Edison independently published a small newspaper and openly sold it on trains while the American Civil War was raging.

At that time, the total population of the United States was less than 30 million. The American president at that time was Lincoln, who led the United States forward, pioneering an unprecedented political situation in the world. The political slogan of the American Civil War was the emancipation of black slaves, and its actual significance was the rise of modern America. The end of this civil war brought about a revolutionary movement in the social system and production organization of the United States. The rapid development of industrial production enabled this young Edison to embark on a glorious path.

Historians often say: The American Civil War produced the hero Lincoln. But few people say: It produced Edison.

In modern history, we can almost omit any politician, but we cannot omit Watt and Edison. Watt's steam engine displaced handicrafts, causing social innovation, while Edison's 1,151 inventions promoted various emerging industries, accelerating the development of the world's industrial age culture. Comparatively, Edison made the most significant contribution to improving human living standards.

"Edison walks the same path as people. But what is the result? He goes to the virgin land that others cannot reach."

The American Civil War produced many millionaires who made fortunes from the war, and these millionaires invested in industry after the war. At the same time, the West began to be developed. A page of Edison's biography is almost equivalent to a modern history of American prosperity. Even though Edison's inventions became tools for a few to make fortunes, Edison's brilliance will never be erased.

Edison was born in a vast background. He blossomed on the physical principles of Newton's era. From an American perspective, it is certainly American glory, but it is also the glory of all mankind.

I believe every reader must understand: In a fragmented China, scientists can never achieve significant achievements in any physical principles.

### New Compilation of Telegraph Codes

— Yi Ding

Due to the nature of my work, I have to look up the "Telegraph Code Book" more than once every day. Every time I look it up, I get a headache.

First of all, I suspect that the initial compilation of this Chinese telegraph tool book, regarding the selection of characters, was based on the subjective formulation of a few people, or was it obtained through statistical summaries of many telegram drafts to obtain the vocabulary of the most commonly used characters. What is placed before us is: approximately a quarter of the obscure characters, strange characters, broken-style characters, variant characters, ... mixed in the main compilation before "7902" (for example, "1427" "朶", "0027" "、", or "0054" "亅"...) while, conversely, many of the most commonly used characters are placed in the "Supplement" after "8001", and the "Supplement to the Supplement" after "9687" (for example, "8082" "偷", "8705" "煙"...), is it really that the character "偷" is not as commonly used as the character "朶"? Is it really that "、" or "亅" is more commonly used than the character "煙"?

Although the Chinese radical character search method has innate shortcomings, the radical arrangement does not necessarily have to adhere to the "unwritten law" of the "Kangxi Dictionary," and related similar radicals can be arranged together as much as possible. For example, for four-stroke radicals, "心," "毛," "爪," and "父," "母" can be strung together, and "行," "竹," "　," "舛" of six-stroke radicals can also be brought as close as possible. Isn't this more "organic" than the current one?

Speaking of "telegraph codes," we always think of the thirty poetic rhyme categories of the "Rhyme Category for Date Sequence," such as "東" representing "the first day," and "冬" representing "the second day." Although this method saves a little compared to the original character, it is still very clumsy and not easy to remember. The recent promulgation of using "99××" to represent the date sequence (such as "9915" representing "the fifteenth day") is indeed much more progressive. Similarly, there is "98××" representing time (such as "9814" representing "2 pm"), which are both very good and flexible methods. However, we still feel that it is not enough. For example, the "monthly sequence" for the twelve months of each year still uses the "Twelve Earthly Branches," that is, the "Twelve Time Periods," to replace them in official telegrams (for example, "寅" representing "March"). It is not easy to remember, and it takes a lot of counting to use. Moreover, it is not included in ordinary telegraph books. This common practice seems to lack "legislative procedures."

Modern people's lives are becoming more and more tense. In the past, people would say "attending court at the Mao hour," but now they have to say "starting work at 8 am sharp." In fact, even though the unit of two hours has been shortened to one hour, it is still not enough. Don't we see such phrases in news telegrams: "Completed in thirty-nine minutes" "Set sail at ten fifty-five"...? We very much hope that we can also create an easy-to-remember and easy-to-use code like "99××" and "98××" to represent these numbers. Or stipulate a "prefix," with the following four digits representing "hour" and "minute," such as "1431" representing "2:31 pm."

When colleagues in the newspaper industry requested the Ministry of Communications to reduce news telegram fees last time, they also mentioned the point of compiling a "News Abbreviation Vocabulary." We urgently need to follow this vocabulary, and at the same time, we also hope to take the opportunity to thoroughly revise the current "New Compilation of Telegraph Codes."

### Young Edison on the Silver Screen

The illustration shows Edison selling newspapers on the train.

### King of Invention

— Jin Xia

The life of the "King of Invention" Edison is full of amazing stories. He achieved the greatest achievements for mankind from a humble background. He invented and improved no fewer than 1,151 items and equipment.

In addition to the well-known electric light, phonograph, and moving pictures, Edison's inventions include: automatic number recorder, automatic sequence machine, duplex telephone, carbon transmitter, Capon news delivery machine, micro-manometer, alkaline storage battery, magnetic ore separator, trackless tram, electric railway, loudspeaker... and so on.

His contribution to scientific culture can be described as unparalleled in ancient and modern times; and Edison was humble, honest, diligent, sincere, and full of compassion. He is not only a gifted genius, but also a complete person.

### Dedicated Everything to Science, Forgot His Own Name

— Qing Huang

Edison focused all his thinking and memory on scientific research; therefore, he was often forgetful about other things that were not related to his work.

Once, Edison was standing in line, waiting to pay taxes. His mind was focused on an invention. When the tax collector asked him for his name, Edison couldn't answer. He intended to fumble for a business card, but he had forgotten to bring it. Later, it was a acquaintance standing behind him who answered for him, and the matter was resolved.

### Edison in his youth.

### Edison is a Great Genius

— Lu Dunfu

But he said that the definition of genius is: "One percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."

Edison's family, generation after generation, lived to old age. His great-grandfather lived to one hundred and four years old, and his grandfather lived to one hundred and two years old. Although he himself was "slightly inferior," he also lived to eighty-four years old, without any illness.

At school, Edison was scolded by teachers as a muddlehead, and the town's doctor arbitrarily diagnosed him with a brain disease. Only his mother discovered his genius and educated him herself. Before the age of twelve, Edison had finished reading Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," Hume's "History of England," Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy," and the "Scientific Encyclopedia" and other great works.

The first book that guided Edison to study science was Ganot's Physics.

The invention that Edison was most proud of in his life was the phonograph. After inventing it, he spent ten years studying and improving it. He studied records and human voices, and investigated the effects, functions, and limitations of various orchestras. He also hired many musicians to listen to them play music. In ten years, he listened to no less than 25,000 kinds of music, all of which he recorded on the phonograph. His laboratory was the most perfect "music library" in the world.

Edison used the phonograph to comfort people's hearts from their ears, and also invented movies, making people's hearts happy from their eyes.

On February 11, 1931, Edison and his wife held a grand celebration for their 84th birthday and participated in the opening ceremony of the Edison Bridge over the Caloosahatchee River. When reporters asked him "What are the elements of success in life?" the kind old man said

"Ambition and voluntary work."

"What is genius?"

Edison said:

"Genius refers to one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."
