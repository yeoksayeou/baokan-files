### End of Ten-Day Northern Tour: President Zhang Returns to Nanjing via Jinan; Will Inspect Southern China and Taiwan Soon

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Premier Zhang Qun returned to Nanjing from Tianjin via special plane at 6:25 PM on the 28th. He departed from Nanjing on the 19th and concluded his ten-day inspection tour of Northeast and North China. Mr. Zhang's trip is the first time an administrative official has inspected remote areas. Mr. Zhang took the Jian Guo special plane, taking off from Tianjin at about 11:00 AM. After an hour, he arrived in Jinan, staying for four hours to attend the Lu Province government work conference and gave instructions. At 4:00 PM, the plane flew south, arriving in Nanjing at 6:25 PM, landing at Ming Palace Airport. Gan Naiguang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and Pu Xuefeng, Deputy Secretary-General, greeted him at the airport. After disembarking, Mr. Zhang smiled and said, "I am like Wedemeyer, bringing back a lot of materials." After greeting the welcomers, he returned to his official residence to rest. According to Mr. Zhang's entourage, his trip was intense, and his inspection work was serious. Even during the flight, he kept official documents in hand, reviewing them. His entourage only had three hours of sleep each day, and Mr. Zhang himself had less than six hours of sleep. However, he gave instructions wherever he went, especially inquiring in detail about political and economic construction, striving to fully understand the local situation. Speaking in terms of economic aspects, Mr. Zhang's trip particularly emphasized the construction of Tanggu New Port, so that Datong's coal could pass through the Ping-Sui Railway and reach the new port, making it the economic link of North China. When Mr. Zhang inspected the new port, it happened to be raining, but he still went with an umbrella, showing great interest. After the completion of the new port, Datong's coal can be exported, yielding US$300 million in annual revenue, and Datong's coal production is excellent and abundant, which can be widely sold to Southeast Asia. Therefore, Mr. Zhang paid great attention to the construction of the new port, which can be said to be second only to politics in this inspection. As for the rumors of rectifying the Northeast circulating currency issue, Mr. Zhang also mentioned it in the Northeast, but it still needs to be studied. This matter is not related to reforming malpractices. In terms of politics, Mr. Zhang believes that the people of the Northeast are extremely honest and sincere. In the past, due to the inability of the receiving personnel to cherish themselves and the possible inappropriateness of policies and guidelines, the vast number of people in the Northeast suffered, and they were dissatisfied with the chaotic situation. Now that Chen Cheng is in charge of the Northeast's military and administration, with the determination to rectify it, the atmosphere has been renewed. The enthusiasm of the crowds welcoming along the way during the inspection was even more intense the further away, which greatly moved Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang believes that the compatriots in the Northeast are younger than those in Nanjing and Shanghai.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] It is learned that Zhang is expected to make a second tour during his tenure to inspect various regions in South China and Taiwan.

### Expressing Five Observations, Paying Attention to Talent and Strengthening Borders

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] After Premier Zhang returned to Nanjing at 6:25 PM on the 28th, he issued a written statement about his Northern trip, saying, "My observations from this inspection of Northeast and North China can be divided into the following five points: Northeast and North China are China's lifeline, not only because of national defense geography, but also because of economic resources. The government and the people must have a common understanding of this and be determined to restore the Northeast and stabilize North China. Because resources are innate, if China cannot ensure the rich resources of the North, even if we have manpower, financial resources, and intelligence, national construction will have nothing to rely on. That is why the government uses most of its elite troops to stabilize the North and uses the greatest financial resources to build the North. During this trip, all the places I went to were areas that had been occupied for a long time. The people have suffered greatly, but they are particularly enthusiastic in loving the country and supporting the government, which makes me realize that the more remote the area, the more lovable the people are, and the more vigorous and energetic spirit appears to be younger. Mencius said: 'Born in sorrow, die in pleasure.' The people of Northeast and North China are surviving sorrow, but they are precisely 'born' in sorrow. During this trip, I inspected several large-scale industrial projects. Wherever the communists went, they were most destructive. It is truly shocking to see. The communists are becoming more and more cruel in killing people, and refugees are fleeing to government-controlled areas one after another. The people of Northeast and North China speak of the communists with both hatred and fear. Therefore, the closer to the communist areas, the less effective their propaganda is, and the closer to the communist areas, the more successful our work of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion is. There are many outstanding military and political leaders in Northeast and North China, as well as many loyal and dedicated support staff. The engineers and employees serving in industry and transportation have the same spirit of fighting for their careers as the officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines. This is commendable, but there is still a shortage of talent in the local areas, especially in the border areas. I believe that China's talent is too concentrated in the cities, forming a disease of 'empty borders and full centers.' There has been a saying since ancient times about 'strengthening the borders.' Today, China should pay attention to 'strengthening the borders with talent' to balance cultural and economic development, not just for national defense significance. Because the people of the North love the country and support the central government, they have high expectations for the government. In some places, they may not fully understand the central government's instructions, which inevitably creates misunderstandings. Especially due to financial difficulties, many tasks are beyond their ability, which inevitably causes frustration. The central government should pay special attention to this in the future, so that the upper levels can understand the lower levels and the lower levels can also understand the upper levels, and that everyone understands each other's difficulties clearly. The laws and regulations must also be in line with reality, so that the reform of politics and the implementation of national policies can be carried out with one heart and one mind."

### Mr. Zhang Inspects Paper Company Before Leaving Tianjin

Agrees to Allocate More Funds for Tanggu New Port Construction

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 28th] Premier Zhang left Tianjin for Jinan at 11:15 AM on the 28th. Before leaving, he met with Wang Chongzhi, General Manager of Kai Luan, and Shi Zhiren, Director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, at the Tianjin Railway Official Residence at 8:00 AM to inquire about the production and export of Kai Luan coal and instructed the Railway Bureau to fully transport it to meet the needs of the South and the North. Then he drove to inspect the Resources Committee, the Paper Pulp and Paper Company, and China Textile Factory No. 4. He then visited Zhang Boling and Jin Yunpeng to say goodbye and inspected the streets of Tianjin City. At 10:45 AM, he arrived at Zhang Guizhuang Airport and left Tianjin for Jinan by special plane at 11:15 AM.

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 28th] The North China Paper Pulp and Paper Company of the Resources Committee, due to insufficient working capital, requested the government to allocate 10 billion yuan when Premier Zhang visited the factory on the 28th. Premier Zhang has agreed to consider it. The factory is the largest paper mill in North China. If it can obtain the working capital, its business will be fully developed.

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 28th] Xing Qizhen, Director of Tanggu New Port, said: The government attaches great importance to the new port. According to the allocation of funds, Qingdao received 20 billion, Huludao received 40 billion, and the new port has received 130 billion. The authorities have agreed to allocate another 50 billion. The new port power plant will be completed this year, and the three warehouses in the first wharf will also be completed before the end of the year. The coal loading machine can be used when the belt is purchased.

[Our Beijing Correspondent, 28th] The work of salvaging sunken ships in Tanggu New Port can be completed before the river freezes this winter. On the eve of Japan's formal surrender, 42 ships of various types were deliberately sunk. Before December last year, 14 of these sunken ships were salvaged. This year, salvage work continued in April, and another 20 ships were salvaged.

### Staying in Jinan for Four Hours, Meeting with Leaders from All Walks of Life

[Our Jinan Correspondent, 28th] Premier Zhang and his party flew to Jinan from Tianjin at 12:20 PM on the 28th. Wang Yaowu and representatives from all walks of life greeted them at the airport. They went to the British Consulate to meet with leaders from all walks of life. Representatives of the United Association of Fellow Townsmen from various counties in Jinan presented a petition detailing the suffering of the people in Lu Province and requested the central government to allocate funds and issue guns and ammunition to assist various counties in establishing local self-defense forces, and also requested to increase disaster relief funds to help refugees. Zhang agreed to handle it after returning to Nanjing, saying that the central government is extremely concerned about the suffering of the North and Shandong, so it is concentrating its efforts to suppress bandits and quell the rebellion. After lunch, Mr. Zhang attended a meeting of various agencies to listen to local opinions and toured the streets. Due to urgent official business, he changed his plan to stay overnight in Jinan and did not go to Qingdao, and flew directly back to Nanjing at 4:00 PM in the afternoon.

[Our Jinan Correspondent, 28th] When Premier Zhang passed through Jinan on the 28th, he answered reporters' questions: How can the government accelerate the completion of the work of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion to alleviate the suffering of the people of Shandong? He replied that the central government has concentrated all its military and political forces to engage in the work of quelling the rebellion. The purpose is nothing more than to stabilize the North, and the main force of the government army is also used in Shandong. The situation in Shandong has improved compared to half a year ago. As for the issue of liberally allocating funds for self-defense in Lu Province and guns, he replied that the Executive Yuan has decided on a plan for organizing and training local armed forces. The central government has only allocated 3 billion to Lu Province's accounts, which is too small. Please increase it. He replied that everyone knows the situation of the national treasury. Is China's economic situation very serious? He replied that the government is trying its best to find a solution.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Organizes Committee to Investigate Economic Enterprises

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] In order to cooperate with the national mobilization measures and promote the development of industry and commerce, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has organized the National Economic Survey Committee, with Technical Supervisor Tan Bohong as the chairman and Statistics Director Wu Zongfen as his deputy. The survey work is divided into two items: A general survey of economic enterprises, with all counties in the country as the survey object. The purpose is to obtain a general overview of economic enterprises in the country in a short period of time. The Ministry has separately sent letters to the Construction Bureaus of various provinces and the Social Bureaus of various cities to be handled by the county governments. A case-by-case survey of economic enterprises, with all major cities in the country as the survey object. Provinces with industrial and commercial guidance offices are responsible for surveying the economic conditions of the location of the office and the important cities in its jurisdiction. For major cities without industrial and commercial guidance offices, consultations are held with local government agencies and academic institutions to entrust them to handle the survey. The survey objects are divided into industrial editing, electrical enterprises, commerce, international trade, and special products.

### County Magistrate Election and Recall Law

The Interior Ministry plans to submit it to the Executive Yuan for review

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] News from the Ministry of Interior: The establishment of provincial and county councils and the election of provincial governors and county magistrates should begin after the implementation of constitutional government. Regarding the election of county magistrates, there was an earlier proposal within the Ministry to conduct trials in various counties. Now that the constitutional period is approaching, it seems unnecessary to conduct trials again. The Interior Ministry has drafted the draft law on the election and recall of county magistrates and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, which can be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Interior Ministry is also drafting the remaining draft laws on provincial and county councils.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Madame Chiang returned to Nanjing from Shanghai by plane at 4:20 PM on the 28th.

### Mongolians in Beijing Suggest the Central Government: Please Determine the Border Stabilization Policy, Guarantee the League and Banner System to Resolve Disputes

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Mongolians in Beijing, in order to deal with the current Mongolian issue, jointly submitted a suggestion to the highest authorities and various ministries and commissions. The signatories include Mongolian representatives to the National Assembly, Mongolian senators, Mongolian representatives stationed in Beijing from various leagues and banners, the Mongolian Association of Fellow Townsmen in Beijing, and the Mongolian Youth Federation. The suggestion pointed out that the reason for the chaos in the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia is nothing more than the central government's failure to establish a basic policy toward Inner Mongolia and the failure to clearly guarantee the league and banner system that the Mongolians have long maintained. In order to clarify right and wrong, relieve the suffering of the Mongolian people, and eliminate border disputes, the following four suggestions are made: Regarding the interpretation of autonomy, the government is requested to determine the basic method for Inner Mongolia as soon as possible based on the Constitution. The autonomy requested by the Mongolian compatriots is only to reduce the separation in the middle of the border provinces and strengthen the connection between the Mongolian people and the central government. Therefore, the focus is only on hoping that all leagues and banners can be directly under the central government, and the autonomy requested by the Mongolian compatriots has long been stipulated in the party's documents. It is only right and proper for the Mongolian compatriots to ask the central government to fulfill its promises and implement the Constitution. Regarding the interpretation of leagues and banners, banners are local administrative units at the county level, and leagues are local governments above the banner level. It is hoped that the central government will truly guarantee the league and banner system. The Mongolian leagues and banners are equivalent to the provinces and counties of the interior. Historically, the leagues and banners each have their own full administrative power and unique administrative system. In addition to obeying the orders of the central government, no other local political organs have the right to directly interfere. Some people on the border deny that the league is a local government above the banner level or only call it an election area. This is a deliberate distortion of the facts and prejudice. Please, our government, respect Mongolian history and establish a practical policy based on current laws and regulations, and firmly protect the league and banner system and rights. The reason for border instability stems from the discrimination suffered by the people of the leagues and banners. Please clarify the powers of leagues, banners, provinces, and counties, and abolish unnecessary county administrations to resolve disputes between Mongolians and Han Chinese. Since their establishment, the provinces along the border have been under a system where the military and administration are not separated, and the psychology of despising weak ethnic groups cannot but permeate all political styles. As for the counties in Mongolia, they were originally established to govern the Han Chinese in Mongolia and had no right to interfere in the administration of Mongolian banners. However, recently, each county has used the protection of the province to take advantage of its superior position to oppress Mongolian compatriots, causing the legal autonomous rights of Mongolian banners to be greatly infringed upon. In addition, in order to expand its power, the province disregards the factual needs and the lives of Mongolians, and forcibly adds county bureaus within each banner, increasing the burden on the people, and causing the Mongolian and Han compatriots in the banner to suffer. The reason why the Inner Mongolia issue exists today is that the conflict between leagues and banners and provinces and counties is the biggest factor. We dare to hope that the central government will make a decisive decision as soon as possible, delineate the boundaries and boundaries between leagues, banners, and provinces and counties, and abolish unnecessary county bureaus in the banners to reduce the burden on the people and prevent the recurrence of disputes. In order to strengthen the connection between the central government and Mongolia, the League Department and Special Banners must be directly under the central government. Article 5 of the Mongolian League and Banner Organization Law promulgated by the National Government stipulates that "all Mongolian leagues and special banners are subordinate to the Executive Yuan." However, today, some people in the border provinces say that the league's direct subordination to the central government has no basis, or should be under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. This can be said to be deliberately obliterating history in order to satisfy their private desire to eliminate the leagues and banners. Moreover, border disputes are all due to political injustice. The provinces and counties oppress the leagues and banners, and the Mongolian compatriots demand autonomy in order to get rid of this shackle, directly under the central government, so as to preserve the survival of the nation. Please adopt the minimum requirements of the Mongolians, strengthen the organization of the League government, and ensure that it is still directly under the Executive Yuan, so as to enhance the connection between the central government and Inner Mongolia and consolidate the border.

### The Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Meet to Discuss Election Issues

[Central News Agency, This City] The Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties held Central Standing Committee meetings in Shanghai on the 28th to discuss election-related issues.

[Another Report] Wang Shizeng, spokesperson for the Youth Party, issued a written statement on the 28th regarding the key points of the three-party consultation on election issues and the reasons for the postponement of the election of National Assembly representatives, as follows: "The nomination of candidates by political parties is a common practice in democratic countries. During this process of preparing for constitutional government in China, the methods for political party nomination have been clearly stipulated in the National Assembly Representative, Legislative Committee Member Election and Recall Law and its implementation regulations. Under the system of political party nomination, any personnel with party membership who wish to participate in the election must be formally nominated as candidates by the political party, otherwise they cannot participate in the election. In recent months, the key points of the consultations between the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Kuomintang regarding elections have been the question of how the candidates of the three parties should be nominated, so as to uphold the spirit of cooperation in jointly drafting the Constitution and jointly shoulder the responsibility of implementing the Constitution."

### The National Government Orders the Addition of Twenty Representatives from Chahar Province; Revision of the Electoral District Division Table for Legislative Committee Members in Anhui Province

### Preliminary Meeting on the Japanese Peace Conference; Possibly to be Held in the US Soon; Foreign Minister Wang to Confer with Truman

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Well-informed sources say that Foreign Minister Wang's work in Washington seems to be quite significant. The postponement of the release of the Wedemeyer investigation report is sufficient to prove that Mr. Wang will discuss the issue with President Truman. Mr. Wang will consult with Washington on the proper method for the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference based on China's position. The veto power issue will also be discussed. Before leaving the country, Mr. Wang had decided that we would propose a solution to this thorny issue at the UN seat. According to confirmed information, this proposal is to reasonably restrict the timing of the use of the veto power to avoid the continued abuse of the veto power to increase the difficulty of the United Nations' actions. In addition, Mr. Wang may take the opportunity to talk to President Truman about thoroughly resolving the knots between the US and the Soviet Union and other countries.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Well-informed sources say that a preliminary discussion meeting on the Japanese Peace Conference may be held here next month. During the United Nations General Assembly period, relevant countries may hold informal discussions.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] According to Chinese officials here, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie will visit US President Truman and Acting Secretary of State Lovett, but does not intend to discuss the issue of US aid to China. However, he said: If the United States wants to discuss this issue, Mr. Wang will also be willing, but China has decided not to raise the matter first at this time, because it feels that there are currently no specific facts available for discussion. US officials believe that US senior officials still need a considerable period of time to digest and use the Wedemeyer report and begin discussing adjustments to their China policy. US officials also intend to use the opportunity of Foreign Minister Wang's visit to seek China's attitude towards holding a preliminary Japanese Profit Conference procedure.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] It is increasingly believed here that after negotiations between China and the United States, it will agree to the US proposal to convene an eleven-nation Japanese Peace Conference without veto power. It is learned that in order to obtain China's consent, the United States will have to publicly recommend a draft treaty and assure China that the treaty will stipulate that Japan's military, economic, and political affairs will be subject to control for at least 30 years.

### Resolving to Gradually Realize the Reorganization of Industry and Mines in North China; Sun Yueqi Goes to Zhangjiakou and Datong to Inspect Coal Mines

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 28th] Industry and mines in North China will gain new opportunities. After Premier Zhang Qun, accompanied by Mr. Sun Yueqi, inspected various industry and mines in Northeast and North China, he has gained a concrete concept of the construction of industry and mines in the North, which he believes is very important. Mr. Sun Yueqi, based on the results of this inspection of the various industry and mines, submitted to Premier Zhang the plan for reorganizing the industry and mines in North China. Mr. Zhang believed that they are all feasible and will seek to gradually realize them after returning to Nanjing. Mr. Sun Yueqi went to Beijing at noon on the 28th and is scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou on the 29th to inspect the Longyan Coal Mine, then转 to Datong to inspect the Datong Coal Mine, and return to Nanjing within ten days. It is learned that a batch of machinery for industry and mines in the North has been shipped from abroad to Shanghai and will soon be transported north for use.

### The Ministry of Economic Affairs Re-drafts the Commercial Registration Law Draft

[Our Nanjing Office, 28th Dispatch] The Commercial Registration Law Draft,

was re-drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs because it believed that the implementation of the current Commercial Registration Law

was not entirely suitable for the current situation. It was

reviewed by the Ministers of Social Affairs, Economic Affairs, Finance, and Judicial Administration, as well as Political Committee Member Ju Zhen, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. Now,

it is learned that they all agreed that this new registration law draft is very

essential, and all expressed their approval. The key points and advantages of the new

law are summarized as follows: The new law combines the current Commercial

Registration Law and its Implementation Rules into one law, adding two chapters on Commercial Names and Businesses Operated by Foreigners.

The articles are quite appropriate and not excessive. Combining the law and the

implementation rules into one makes it easier for the people to understand and comply with, and the implementation is more convenient (as is the case with the new Company Law and Banking Law).

The new law does not adopt a listing method for the scope of commerce,

but instead, like the Company Law, uses a definition-based provision. For small-scale

businesses, the central competent department is given the discretion to approve it at any time, making it more flexible in practice. The new law changes the free registration principle

to a mandatory registration principle, so that the government can use the registration system to

manage commerce reasonably and promote its normal development.

The new law requires that registrations other than the establishment or alteration of a business, such as partnership registration, manager registration,

agent registration, registration of persons with limited capacity for action, and registration of agents, etc., should be

registered simultaneously at the time of establishment or alteration, to simplify the process. The new law adds a section on Commercial Names,

with clear provisions for the protection and exercise of exclusive rights to trade names,

and still adopts the usage principle in registration to conform to the facts.

The new law adds a chapter on Foreign Businesses,

hoping to use registration methods to properly manage foreign businesses, and to echo the chapter on Foreign Companies in the new Company Law, thereby aligning with the purpose of utilizing

foreign investment to develop post-war industries.

[Our Nanjing Office, 28th Dispatch] The Commercial Registration Law Draft

was submitted to a provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan for discussion on the 27th. It was resolved to have the Ministry of Economic Affairs publish the draft, solicit opinions from public and private legal entities,

### Using Roman Letters to Spell National Phonetics; Replacing Chinese Characters for Sending Telegrams; Invention of Ying Changqi; Taiwan Bank Trial

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 28th Dispatch] "National Phonetic Telegram Dictionary" by Mr. Ying Changqi, which took eight months to write, has recently been published. This is the first work in our country that uses Roman letters to spell national phonetics to replace Chinese characters. Mr. Ying, as the manager of the business department of Taiwan Bank, has been studying philology for many years. His "National Phonetic Telegram Dictionary" first collected 4,000 commonly used Chinese characters and 11,000 commonly used words in the banking industry, and spelled them into Roman letter codebooks according to the national phonetics. On September 26, 1928, Cai Yuanpei, President of the University Council, issued and promulgated the "National Language Romanization System". September 26th of this year is the 19th anniversary of the promotion of phonetic Roman letters in our country. Taiwan Bank decided to start using Roman letter phonetic code to send and receive telegrams from the 26th, to commemorate this achievement.

### National Cotton Production This Year May Reach 11 Million Dan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry recently told reporters about the national cotton production situation this year: There are more than 39 million mu of cotton fields this year, and it is expected to produce 11 million dan of seed cotton. Judging from the current climate, this number should not have major discrepancies. Regarding the number of purchases that can be made this year, if we take the total production of 11 million dan, and subtract the estimated 6.5 million dan required for people's clothing and textile use, about 4.5 million dan can be purchased. However, cotton for clothing and hand-spinning is elastic and may decrease. If the cotton price is appropriate, purchases are vigorous, and cotton farmers are unwilling to store more cotton, then the purchase number may also increase to 6 million dan. Regarding the method of purchasing cotton, the current price is 2 million national currency per dan. Purchasing 4.5 million dan requires funds of 9 trillion to 12 trillion yuan. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry believes that it is not necessary for government financial institutions to handle this, and it is best for each yarn factory and cotton firm to purchase freely.

### The Press Conference in Warsaw: Fifth Letter from Poland – Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of This Newspaper

During my journey in Warsaw, what I admired and appreciated the most was the Polish International Publicity Department, or "Polish Publicity Department," which belongs to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is equivalent to many "departments" in rank. The director, Grot, is a middle-aged man with a receding hairline who speaks fluent English and Russian effortlessly. Some say he is proficient in six languages; at the very least, I know his French is also excellent. People in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs call him "General." It is said that he once served in the military for a while, but he is essentially a man of letters. Since the restoration, he has been burdened with the most "important" work of the Polish government.

Grot holds three foreign press conferences every week, at twelve noon on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Each meeting is a debate with sharp tongues and swords. I truly admire those British and American colleagues who have such sharp questions, but General Grot is always able to handle them with ease. I remember during one particular week in Warsaw, all three press conferences discussed the issue of American aid for European food. Marshall, in Washington, based on Harrison's report, said that Poland had more than enough food and did not need further American aid. At the press conference, Wan Luo protested strongly on behalf of the government, calling Harrison's report a "lie" and Marshall's decision "unfair."

He always speaks in English first, then translates himself into Russian. At foreign press conferences, English and Russian are considered official languages. Journalists from Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union appreciate his Russian, while we feel his English is really beautiful. Due to differences in language and political background, the same round table is invisibly divided into two camps. What I find most interesting is the cigarettes on the table. Chinese, British, American, and French journalists all smoke American cigarettes, while journalists from Russia, Czechoslovakia, South [Yugoslavia], Finland, etc., all smoke Russian cigarettes.

The first time I attended a foreign press conference, many British and American journalists looked at me but did not speak to me. I remember very clearly that it was not until I took out a pack of "Marquis" cigarettes from my pocket and placed it on the table that an American female journalist leaned over and started talking to me.

However, General Wan Luo is able to deal with both sides very well. Firstly, his linguistic talent allows him to move easily between all parties. Secondly, he possesses rich knowledge and a quick mind. When protesting Harrison's report, he particularly emphasized that Poland's summer and autumn crops this year lacked seeds and provided many figures to support his claim. An American journalist said, "May I ask why the Polish government doesn't get seeds from Russia and always asks the United States?" The tone of the question was clearly humorous, what they call "digging" in Shanghai dialect, but Wan Luo remained calm. He said, "From Russia? We are currently negotiating in Moscow; whether it succeeds or not is another matter." He went on to say, "There are rich countries in the world and there are poor countries. Russia and the United States were both allies of Poland during the war. It would not be reasonable for us not to ask the United States but instead to ask Russia, which is preoccupied with its own problems. And as for the United States, it would be unfair to favor one ally over another!"

The second time the food issue was discussed, Grot invited a government official in charge of farming and import-export trade to report. The conclusion, of course, was still to criticize the United States for its "bias and unfairness." A journalist named Wheeler from the Chicago Daily News, who had just arrived from the United States, was so enraged that he stood up and said angrily, "During the war, the United States spent so much money and so many lives to liberate many European countries. After the war, the United States continues to spend tens of billions of dollars to help the Allies. May I ask what offense has Poland suffered to warrant such harsh criticism?" Grot smiled and told him, "You must have just come from the United States, sir. You didn't hear the first part. What you said is correct, but it's not the issue being discussed now. I'm sorry, please be quiet!"

Grot is a loyal Polish Communist, which his female secretary, Anna Krzysztof, told me when I hosted her for dinner. I stuck out my tongue, and she asked why. I said, "I am a professional journalist, and Grot is in the same line of work. From the perspective of my peers, I believe that a top-notch Polish talent like him should be above any partisan prejudice." I repeated, "I regret his joining the Communist Party."

Partisan bias can hinder the truthfulness of news reports. I remember at one meeting discussing the food issue, a British journalist asked, "May I ask if Poland has any intention of sending its food out the back door to another country and then requesting aid from the United States through the front door?" Grot replied, "No." Then, another American female journalist asked, "Can you guarantee that?" Grot hesitated for a moment and still said, "I guarantee with my conscience that there is absolutely no such thing!"

I plan to introduce the general situation of Polish industry and agriculture in future dispatches. Here, I should point out that the iron discipline of the Communist Party is clearly reflected in Poland. Several weeks before I arrived in Warsaw, when Marshall gave a speech at Harvard University about the European Economic Recovery Plan, the Polish government and public, especially most of the leftist newspapers, had loudly touted their "sincere support" and warm welcome. The day Molotov flew to Paris was almost the happiest day for the Polish intellectuals. There are two reasons to explain this: first, Poland's devastated situation meant they hoped to use the Marshall Plan to achieve economic reconstruction. Second, and more importantly, the Polish people hoped that the Marshall Plan could invisibly eliminate the division between Eastern and Western Europe and bridge the gap between the Soviet bloc and the British-American bloc.

However, Molotov's short trip to Paris shattered their dreams. Non-communist Polish intellectuals once again fell into the dark abyss, anxiously envisioning a bleak future and a difficult situation. The Communist left-wing newspapers made a 180-degree turn and criticized the Marshall Plan, using satirical and sharp headlines to say that Marshall was boldly fooling the European people. (To be continued).

### Qingdao U.S. Military Incident: Sino-American Consultation to Remedy

[Qingdao Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] Major Ogg, the commander of the U.S. Marine Corps military police stationed in Qingdao, recently discussed several remedial measures with the Chinese authorities regarding the continuous incidents caused by the U.S. military: U.S. soldiers guarding will use shotguns, but may still shoot when necessary; however, shotguns are not lethal beyond four steps. For those who attempt to escape after causing traffic accidents, all U.S. military police patrol cars will now be equipped with wireless telephones for communication and command, which can quickly intercept the culprit drivers and severely punish them. To avoid U.S. soldiers mistakenly taking private cars for taxis and forcing rides, the two types of vehicles will now be marked with separate signs for clarification. The placing of "Out of Bounds" signs by the U.S. military in various bars, which infringes upon Chinese sovereignty, is something Major Ogg insists on; the matter is now being referred to Mayor Li and Commander Kirk for resolution. In the event of an incident, doctors from both China and the United States should be present for examination.

Editorial

### Refuting Stryker's Argument Against Reparations

Mr. Stryker, advisor on reparations issues for the U.S. Department of the Army, recently published an article in "America Magazine" entitled "Retaliation is Waste," fundamentally opposing the United Nations' demands for reparations from Germany and Japan. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, he even advocated abandoning the Pauley mission's reparations plan and overturning the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions on this issue, so that Japan could retain a higher level of industry and embark on a path of self-sufficiency. When we saw Mr. Stryker's argument against reparations, we initially thought that this was merely Mr. Stryker's personal opinion and could not represent the attitude of the American diplomatic authorities towards the issue of Japanese reparations, and therefore did not deserve much attention. However, based on Mr. Stryker's brief biography, he has served as an advisor on reparations issues for the U.S. Department of the Army since November 1945, worked in Germany for a year, and then returned to the United States, where he served as chairman of the Special Committee on Japanese Reparations and represented the Department of the Army in investigating the situation in Japan. Now, he has published such a strange argument against reparations, which is indeed worthy of our attention. Moreover, this strange argument can be mutually confirmed with the delayed attitude of the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo towards the issue of reparations. Especially in the United States, after an individual's views are published in newspapers and magazines, if they can gain the approval of the majority of the people, then they can influence American policy towards Japan. Therefore, Mr. Stryker's publication of the argument against reparations will have an adverse impact on the Allies' demands for reparations, which deserves the attention of our country's government and public.

We have repeatedly read Mr. Stryker's article published in "America Magazine" and summarized the main points as follows: The United States does not need the industrial equipment of Germany and Japan, so the United States not only does not want reparations from Germany and Japan, but should also encourage or help Germany and Japan to be self-sufficient. Only in this way can the United States stop its relief efforts. Regarding the issue of reparations from Germany, the opinions of Britain and the United States are relatively close, both advocating giving Germany a better opportunity to produce more food and more goods that can be exported. However, the Soviet Union demanded 10 billion U.S. dollars in reparations from Germany, and France also wanted to collect as much as possible from Germany, which were both opposed by the United States. The Pauley plan has been approved by the Far Eastern Commission, and the U.S. representative has also expressed agreement, but the United States should abandon or revise this plan. China and the Soviet Union can both exercise veto power within the Far Eastern Commission and will inevitably express objections to the United States' revision of the Pauley plan. In order to implement its demands, the United States has no choice but to set aside the Far Eastern Commission. Even if the eventual outcome is the United States making peace with Japan alone, it is worth doing.

If we stand in the narrow, selfish position of the American people to read Mr. Stryker's grand argument, we may also think that it is reasonable. But from our perspective, Mr. Stryker's fallacies, if adopted by the American authorities, will not only mislead people and have an adverse impact on other countries, but will also inevitably lead to the United States suffering the consequences and making a major diplomatic mistake.

First, during the occupation, the United States certainly spent a large number of U.S. dollars in Germany and Japan, which the American taxpayers had to bear. However, the purpose of occupying Germany and Japan was to control them, to disarm them militarily, to make them increasingly democratic politically, and to reduce their industrial level economically, thereby fundamentally eliminating their aggressive ideology and depriving them of their aggressive strength, so as not to launch another world war. Therefore, the burden on American taxpayers today can be said to be the price of permanent peace, and certainly not a waste. The meaning of reparations is not only to punish the defeated countries, but also to thoroughly destroy their war industries so that their aggressive train cannot start again. Reparations are not about retaliation, let alone waste. It is true that the United States does not need the industrial equipment of Germany and Japan, but this certainly cannot be used as a reason to oppose reparations, nor can it be used as a reason to prevent other victorious countries from dismantling German and Japanese factories, let alone encourage and help the defeated countries maintain their industrial level, so that their aggressive ambitions will not be rekindled one day.

Second, in recent years, the Allied Headquarters has consistently adopted a lenient attitude towards Japan. This newspaper has repeatedly written articles believing that leniency is sufficient to breed evil, and special vigilance should be raised regarding Japan's rapid recovery. Mr. Stryker's views are completely the same as what the Allied Headquarters has done. Therefore, we cannot help but suspect that some people in the United States today have gradually forgotten the painful lessons of the Pearl Harbor incident, and in the minds of these people, the enemy of the United States in the Far East is no longer Japan, and in Europe it is no longer Germany. The formation of this kind of thinking is really too dangerous! Not only is it enough to promote the division of the world at present, but it is also enough to lead to another war in the future. Judging from the diplomatic offensive that the United States has adopted at the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, it can be seen that the United States is moving along this road.

Third, the Far Eastern Commission was created in accordance with the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Declaration, and its sole task is to deal with the Japanese problem and draft a peace treaty with Japan. Because China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are the countries most closely related to the Far Eastern situation, they all have the special privilege of veto power. The existence of veto power is certainly sufficient to hinder the progress of the Far Eastern Commission, but for the sake of a fair and lasting peace in the Far East, the veto power should be retained, and at most it can only be restricted. The United States wants to set aside the Far Eastern Commission, and there is ultimately no legal basis for it in the process of drafting a peace treaty with Japan. Moreover, once the steps are disrupted, drafting a peace treaty with Japan will become more difficult.

Fourth, the idea of the United States making peace with Germany and Japan alone was first advocated by former President Hoover. Although American public opinion was interested in it, the American government did not pay much attention to it. Today, seeing Mr. Stryker's strange argument, he also advocates making peace alone, which shows that Hoover's advocacy has gradually become more common and powerful in the United States today. However, it must be known that peace is indivisible. If the United States truly wants to make peace with Japan alone, it is meaningless and will only cause international disputes.

In short, American policy towards Japan seems to need to be changed. We want to advise the American diplomatic authorities not to haggle over their own immediate interests, but to plan for the entire Far East.

### Political Reform and the Talent Problem (Part 2)

— Du Zuozhou

Naturally, it cannot be said that all true talents are abandoned or misplaced, without obtaining appropriate positions. But under the current severe economic situation and meager treatment, the income of a senior civil servant or university professor is almost less than that of a rickshaw puller. Those who remain steadfast and self-disciplined have no choice but to endure hunger and cold, and wait for death; while those with wavering wills, on the contrary, have many ways to gain both fame and fortune. Zeng Guofan, grieving over the politics of his time, once said with deep sorrow: "Everyone thinks that the lack of soldiers is not enough to be deeply worried about today, and the lack of salaries is not enough to weep bitterly over, but looking around this world, it is impossible to find someone who does not put personal gain first and fears being behind in rushing to righteousness, and who is filled with loneliness and indignation; or even if such a person is found, he is forced to live in a humble position until he is old, sick, frustrated, leaves, or dies, while those who are greedy and cowardly are promoted to the top, and become rich, famous, healthy, and immortal—is this something to be celebrated!" These words are no different from a portrayal of today's situation. How similar the societal distress and the mistreatment of talent are between then and now!

We want to shout out that to reform politics, we must first pay attention to the talent problem, that is, to pay attention to the way out for intellectuals in general. Intellectuals, appearing in Chinese history as scholar-officials, have a special status and influence, and the heirloom of successive rulers has been to rack their brains to win over and control intellectuals. In today's democratic era, those who hold power can no longer copy the control policies of the past, but if they are not even as good as the shallow techniques of treating scholar-officials in the past, then when will the source of national chaos be eliminated? It is a thought-provoking question.

Solving the talent problem naturally starts with education, but distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. The country has been running education for decades, and today we have such a serious talent problem. This is certainly not the fault of education itself, but rather than placing hope in the effects of the distant future, why not find ways to settle and properly arrange the talents that have already been cultivated? Moreover, solving the talent problem of this generation is tantamount to opening up a bright path for the talent cultivation of the next generation. Otherwise, if talents are wasted generation after generation, what can be imagined for the future of the country and the nation?

Finally, regarding the solution to the talent problem, which depends on the proper way to maintain talent, the author believes that the following points should be thoroughly implemented:

Loosen the restrictions on qualifications: We admit that qualifications such as diplomas and letters of appointment are standards for measuring talent, but overly emphasizing qualifications is like "judging people by appearance and losing sight of Ziyu," because "appearance" is formal, and qualifications are also formal. True talents do not necessarily have qualifications, and those with qualifications are not necessarily all talents. Strict civil service systems can only deal with ordinary talents and prevent the evils of speculation and good fortune, but for special and outstanding talents, they must be promoted exceptionally so that they can fully display their talents without being bound by the restrictions of qualifications.

Eliminate unworthy officials: "When owls are in the forest, phoenixes flee." If mediocrity is not removed, talent will not come. From ancient times, petty people and gentlemen cannot work together. Therefore, if the authorities have the determination to use new people and implement new policies, they must first eliminate the old and unworthy elements, and then new people can be introduced, and true talents will be happy to serve. Rectifying officialdom and cleaning up the bureaucracy is the first priority.

Open up more avenues for employing people: The state's formal way of recruiting talents is through examinations. Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the examination system and listed it as one of the five powers, which was truly a brilliant insight. However, the past national college entrance examinations and various special examinations have only served as embellishments, a "spot of red in a sea of green," and have not been able to have an impact on the entire system. In the future, in order to open up more avenues for employing people and give talents the opportunity to "stand out," it is most appropriate to strengthen the implementation of the examination system. In addition, investigating unemployment, conducting talent registration, and providing job placement services are also very important.

Straighten out the discipline of elections: Elections are the first step into politics, and campaigning is an opportunity for talents to demonstrate themselves. How cautiously should this be held in the grand ceremony of opening the country. However, the current election discipline is too disappointing. Campaigning involves collusion and spending hundreds of millions at every turn; fights and disturbances are even recorded in the newspapers from time to time. This has simply become a competition of money and force, what does it have to do with talent! In order to protect the sanctity of politics, we cannot help but call out the slogan of "straightening out election discipline" to urge attention from all parties!

Increase the remuneration at all levels: This goes without saying. But like the standard for adjusting the remuneration of civil servants that the Executive Yuan passed this time, increasing the basic allowance by "100,000 yuan" per person, as the professors at Peking University said: "It's simply joking with us!" If we continue to "joke" like this, talents will either be gone or starve to death, how can this be!

In short, to reform politics, we must first pay attention to solving the talent problem. As the saying goes, "cadres determine everything," that is, talents determine everything. We hope that the government can be decisive in personnel renewal and truly show a refreshing appearance. This is really the key to whether our politics can be thoroughly reformed. Throughout history, politicians who have molded and shaped the talents of an era have certainly not been able to avoid lamenting the existence of "pearls buried in the sea," but their attitude of cherishing talent like life and treating the virtuous with courtesy can inspire the common people, and "all around will dare not disobey." Therefore, the principles of employing people and administering government are actually very simple. If they are understood with divine clarity, then all rivers will flow into the sea, and all the talents in the world will be used for one's own benefit; if they are acted against, then there will be collapse and overflow, and there will be no way to clean up the mess. The complexity of the talent problem is such!

Save the domestic talents who are in distress! "As long as the green hills remain, there is no fear of running out of firewood." Talents are the country's "green hills." We must cherish them and protect them. The future of national construction really depends on them. (The End)

### Promoting Korean Political Independence Should be Monitored by the United Nations; US Stance on Korean Issue is Clear; Likely to Largely Agree with Soviet Withdrawal Proposal

[United Press International, Washington, 28th] US officials feel they have achieved some real progress in resolving the Korean issue. Sources with inside knowledge say the US is expected to issue a statement next week welcoming the Soviet proposal for the joint withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from Korea. At the same time, the US will intensify its call for the UN General Assembly to consider the issue of Korean independence under a unified government. If the current plan can be thoroughly implemented, the US will indirectly point out that the Soviet proposal, in fact, accepts one of the seven points the US advocated on August 28th, which the Soviets then rejected. At that time, the US requested a four-power conference on Korea and stated its views on the purpose of this conference. The US requested immediate elections of legislative representatives in the US and Soviet occupation zones, the creation of a constitution for Korea under UN supervision, and the US hoped that the provisional government of Korea and related countries could agree on a date for the withdrawal of occupying forces from Korea. In addition, the US suggested in August that all steps of this plan be monitored by the United Nations and that allied nations jointly decide on the economic assistance Korea should receive. While accepting the Soviet withdrawal proposal, the US will insist that UN personnel be dispatched to supervise the withdrawal and election process to prevent conspiracies that might be launched by extreme reactionary elements in the US-occupied zone and communist cells in the Soviet-occupied zone. General opinion here is that the Soviet Union's sudden tacit approval of a portion of the US plan may accelerate agreement on Korean independence, but it may also deprive Korea of much of the economic assistance it could obtain from the US. The US intends to use the continuation of the US-Soviet stalemate to force Congress to agree to allocate long-term aid to Korea. If the Soviet Union suddenly agrees to withdraw and agrees to UN supervision of Korea, it is generally believed that interest here in economic assistance may decrease as a result. In any case, the US representative in the UN will seek ways to make the allied nations economically responsible for Korea and will point out the necessary construction while ensuring the maximum cooperation of the US to promote this matter.

[United Press, Seoul, 28th] It was learned today that the Soviet Union's recent proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet occupying forces from Korea next spring contained the phrase "believing that this withdrawal will give the Korean people the opportunity to organize their own government with the assistance of allied nations." After being translated by American experts, it was mistakenly interpreted as "will give the Korean people the opportunity to organize their own government without relying on the assistance of allied nations." This led to statements by Korean leaders such as Syngman Rhee, who believed that as a result, Korea would be in danger of civil war.

### Vyshinsky Discusses the Korean Issue; Advocates Consultation Among Three Powers; Opposes Submitting the Issue to the UN General Assembly

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 27th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky issued a statement on the Korean issue at a press conference yesterday. The full text is as follows: He said that the Korean issue should be resolved through an agreement between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. A reporter asked what the prospects were for resolving the Korean issue within the UN General Assembly. He replied that his view was optimistic, and he believed that if one wanted to resolve this issue, one needed to take a small step, which was to withdraw this issue from the UN agenda. The UN General Assembly, in any case, has no reason to discuss this issue; it should be resolved by an agreement among the three powers that have certain obligations regarding this issue, namely the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States.

We are deeply aware that it is the United States' suggestion to abolish the negotiations of the US-Soviet Joint Commission and deny the need to immediately grant Korea independence. What I want to say on this matter is that the Soviet delegation, in its statement opposing the Korean issue being submitted to the UN General Assembly, stated that the best way to resolve this issue was to resolve it without the participation of the General Assembly. He also solemnly pointed out that the fact is that this issue is not within the capacity of the UN General Assembly and involves Article 11 of the Charter, which also involves the obligations and provisions of the agreement reached at the 1945 Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, which are truly needed to resolve the second paragraph of Article 37 regarding the Korean issue. I can also quote what was said by a United Press reporter and several other reports to implement the proposal of General Shtykov, the chief Soviet representative to the US-Soviet Joint Commission, which advocated that the US and Soviet occupying forces in Korea withdraw simultaneously from Korea in early 1948 and that the future issues be left to the Korean people to decide for themselves. All I can say is that we believe this is the best way to resolve this issue and the Korean issue. In order to help resolve this issue, we should remove it from the UN General Assembly agenda. Note by the reporter: Vyshinsky's statement did not mention China, which is deeply noteworthy.

### Truman Will Meet with Congressional Leaders Today to Discuss Emergency Measures to Aid Europe; Marshall Flew Back to Washington Last Night

[This newspaper's report] New York, 28th broadcast: Truman will meet with congressional leaders tomorrow to discuss the most important issue since he became president, namely, the transitional and long-term nature of US aid to Europe. If the negotiations fail, Europe will be on the verge of disaster.

[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] US Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to fly to Washington tonight to hold a meeting with President Truman and congressional leaders on the 29th, and will return here that evening.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Democratic Senators Russell and McClellan said: President Truman may reach a gentleman's agreement with congressional leaders when he meets with them on Monday so that the President can use existing federal funds to solve Europe's immediate crisis without having to convene a special session of Congress. Russell et al. pointed out that the US Export-Import Bank, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and the Commodity Credit Corporation still have large amounts of floating capital. According to existing laws, the government cannot use these funds to aid foreign countries, but Truman can find a way to reach a temporary agreement with congressional leaders to temporarily use this money to meet Europe's urgent needs.

### Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito Severely Criticizes American Financial Groups

[Reuters, Belgrade, 27th] Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito, in his address to the opening of the Second Congress of the National Front Party of Yugoslavia yesterday, accused American financial groups of leading a revival movement of fascism based on greedy and aggressive imperialism. He also called on progressive elements everywhere in the world to struggle with all their might to prevent another horrific tragedy. Tito also said that international reactionaries, unable to annihilate the Soviet Union, are now attempting to prevent the establishment of truly democratic countries. They are borrowing the horrific ideas of fascism and rebuilding aggressive centers, including in Germany, as bases for imperialist expansion.

### The Soviet Union Presents a Counterproposal on the Greek Issue to the UN General Assembly; Demands that Foreign Troops Withdraw from Greek Territory

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 27th] Soviet Representative Gromyko presented a new resolution to the UN General Assembly's Political Committee, accusing Greece of being fully responsible for all border incidents and demanding that foreign troops withdraw from Greece and that a special committee be established to supervise foreign aid to Greece. The resolution stated: The Greek authorities should bear full responsibility for the border incidents between Greece and Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania; The internal situation in Greece is the main reason for the border tensions; The current situation in Greece is largely due to foreign interference in Greece's internal affairs.

The resolution also called on the UN General Assembly to make the following recommendations: The Greek government should take measures to prevent border incidents; Greece should restore normal relations with its neighbors; Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania should conclude new border conventions and resolve the refugee problem; The Greek government should take measures to stop discrimination against Macedonian and Albanian citizens; Withdraw foreign troops stationed in Greece; Establish a UN special committee to supervise foreign aid to Greece. Gromyko's speech was 10,000 words long and mostly repeated old tunes, such as accusing Greece's "fascist" government of implementing a policy of terror against domestic democratic and progressive elements. He also accused the United States of openly interfering in Greece's internal affairs, inciting the flames of civil war. The United States even held elections for the Greek government and wanted to make Greece enter into a state of economic and political slavery. Gromyko also warned the United States, declaring that if a solution could not be found in the UN General Assembly, adopting collective security action would cause the collapse of the UN organization and undermine genuine cooperation between nations. He said that the US's advocacy of open military intervention in Greece is an extremely unfavorable and dangerous path for the UN organization.

### The British Conservative Party Strives to Make a Comeback; Churchill Condemns the Government and Launches a Major Attack on its Policy Towards the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Essex County, Snell's Brook, 27th] British wartime Prime Minister Churchill addressed 5,000 Conservative Party members here, severely attacking the Soviet Union's aggression and conspiracies, and its abuse of the veto power. He said: The United States today is facing militarized communism backed by Soviet military power, all because the Soviet government has launched aggressive conspiracies in the countries bordering it and the Soviet government has abused its veto power to undermine the UN organization, which the people of the world place great hope in.

Churchill also severely condemned the Labour government, pointing out the sharp decline in Britain's international standing, the decline in the people's living standards, and the ever-worsening domestic economic and financial situation. Churchill also mentioned the "Soviet Iron Curtain" speech he delivered in Fulton, Missouri, in the United States two years ago, saying that although the American people were surprised when they heard it at the time, if he were to give this speech again in the United States today, Americans would regard it as a stale argument with no stimulation. Churchill praised Foreign Secretary Bevin highly, saying that Bevin's firm diplomatic policy was in sharp contrast to what his other cabinet members were doing domestically. Here, Churchill again made a scathing criticism of socialism. He also called on Conservative Party members to prepare for a sudden election at any time so that they could be elected to represent a new opportunity for national strength and wisdom.

### Churchill Comments on World Affairs

When commenting on recent major events in the world, Churchill pointed out that the execution of Bulgarian opposition leader Petkov was a judicial murder and a groundless murder, and said that the Soviet Union should bear the main responsibility for this matter. Churchill welcomed the government's decision to withdraw from Palestine, hoping that the withdrawal work could be carried out as quickly as possible. He pointed out that Britain was spending large sums of money and manpower in the Holy Land, and all it got was the resentment of the people there and around the world. He expressed his gratification that Britain was able to support the United States in maintaining the freedom and democracy of Europe and to provide food to famine-stricken countries. He also said that today he heard the cry of dollar panic for the first time, but it should be known that the dollar is the hard work of hundreds of millions of Americans, who voluntarily contribute, sometimes even without expecting repayment, to help the unfortunate people overseas. When talking about India, he said that the acts of slaughter there did not exceed his expectations, and this was just the beginning of an even worse situation in the future.

### Attlee Encourages Labour Party Members; The Opposition's Attacks are Detrimental and Useless

[Reuters, Leicester, 27th] Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech here to Labour Party members, urging them to maintain the adventurous spirit during the Labour movement's development and to remember the socialist mission that the Labour Party bears. Attlee pointed out that the results of local re-elections showed that even under the current economic situation, the people continue to support the Labour Party. Attlee also criticized the opposition party for promoting situations that are inconsistent with the facts abroad, which is detrimental and useless to Britain. The Prime Minister also pointed out that Britain's need to adopt restrictive measures is also partly due to the slow post-war recovery of other European countries. The problems encountered by Asian and European countries cannot be avoided by Eastern countries either. He felt that the Soviet newspapers' fierce attacks on other countries could show the difficulties experienced by the Soviet government.

### Protests Against Sugar Transport to Germany Erupt in France

### The Investigation of the Indonesian Situation has been Completed; The Consular Corps Compiles a Report; Robberies Continue in Java

[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] The Indonesian "Peace Making" Committee composed of the United States, Belgium, and Australia will soon begin its work, and the report of the six-nation Consular Corps' investigation of the ceasefire order may be the basis for the work of the three-nation committee.

The Consular Corps personnel will meet with Dutch officials here on Monday to raise similar questions.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 27th] According to authoritative sources today, the first telegram report of the Consular Corps currently in the Dutch East Indies has been sent here, stating that robberies in Java (especially robberies of overseas Chinese) are still continuing. According to reliable sources, the content of the report is quite worrying. Although the five consuls (including the Chinese Consul General) did not specify who was to blame, the report clearly stated that neither the Dutch nor the Indonesian side had fully complied with the Security Council's ceasefire order. The report also attributed the responsibility for the robbery of overseas Chinese property to individuals in the Republic of Indonesia.

The one dispatched here last night was the first temporary report of the Consular Corps, and the detailed report is expected to arrive here next week.

### French Merchant Tram and Bus Services Did Not Resume Yesterday; British Merchant Tram Services Suddenly Went on Strike Again; Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Sternly Criticizes the Inaccuracy of the Cost of Living Index; Orders Resumption of Work or Consequential Action

[This newspaper's report] The labor strike of the French Merchant Water and Electricity Company's tram and bus workers has not been resolved. Some workers of the British Merchant Tram Company also entered a state of strike at 6:00 PM yesterday. All of the vehicles on Route 1, Route 2, Route 5, Route 3, Route 16, Route 14, Route 17, and Route 20 were successively driven into the depot and stopped around 7:00 PM. The routes of Route 8, Route 7, Route 10, and Route 11 still maintained service until the scheduled time. If the workers continue to be deadlocked, only the municipal Public Works Bureau's buses will serve the citizens today.

The French Merchant Electricity and Bus services remained suspended yesterday. More than 2,700 workers gathered in the union hall after the sit-down strike the day before yesterday afternoon, and only dispersed at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. At noon, the Social Affairs Bureau sent an official letter to the union, strictly ordering them to resume work on a specific date. The original letter stated: "It has been found that the chairman of the union, in order to demand bonus money and other issues, did not apply to this bureau according to law beforehand, and carried out a strike, which is incorrect. Now, at the time of the national general mobilization, workers must not strike or sit-down strike, and orders have been clearly issued. The union is to forward instructions to the striking workers to resume work on a specific date, in order to respect the law. If they dare to deliberately delay, it will be regarded as automatic resignation, and the company will be allowed to dismiss them unconditionally. The union bears the responsibility of leadership, and must earnestly guide them, and must not delay. This is extremely important, this order."

After receiving the instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau, the union announced to all workers that a temporary general meeting would be held at 4:00 PM to discuss the matter, but because not many people attended the meeting, there were no results. It was not until around 6:00 PM that the representatives of the ticket sales of Route 98 and the representatives of the line of Route 17 gave explanations to all the workers on behalf of the board of directors and supervisors, and decided to reconvene at 8:00 AM this morning to discuss the issue of resuming work.

[Da Gong News Agency] After the British Merchant Electricity and Bus workers went on strike, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said last night: This strike of the British Merchant trams is completely without reason. The union has always been unaware, and has not made any representations to the Social Affairs Bureau. Afterwards, a small number of workers stated that the reason for the strike was the inaccuracy of the cost of living index. The cost of living index investigated and compiled by the municipal authorities is absolutely accurate. Moreover, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, which represents all the workers in the city, also conducted an index investigation in the middle of this month, and the figures compiled were roughly the same as those statistically compiled by the municipal bureau. This shows that the reasons they hold are merely excuses. Even if the index is inaccurate, the workers should first appeal to the government. The sudden strike shows that someone is instigating it from behind. The government authorities, considering that most of the good workers are being instigated, have limited them to resume work and hope that the workers will no longer be exploited by others, and will resume work soon, otherwise, they will have to take resolute measures, and will never tolerate it.

According to Qiu Changjiang, chairman of the British Merchant Tram Industry Union, the union had no knowledge of the reason for the suspension of British Merchant tram services last night. It was purely an external force that oppressed some of the workers and exploited them. After the outfield workers drove the vehicles into the military factory, they went home separately, so it was impossible to persuade them. It is still unknown whether work can be resumed today.

### Various Parties Request the Selection and Appointment of Senators; City Council Sends Telegram to Central Authorities Urging Reconsideration

[Report from Our Newspaper] Last Friday (the 26th), during a State Council meeting,

a proposal was made by the Youth Party Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party to amend the regulations for city and county councils and provisional councils

to allow the central government to appoint representatives from various parties to participate in councils at all levels. The proposal has been passed and sent to the Legislative Yuan to be handled in accordance with the principles of the 12th article of the administrative policy. It is reported that the two speakers of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Pan and Xu, believe that any formal provincial, city, and county council generated by election should, in principle, not allow centrally appointed senators to participate midway, considering it a stain on democracy. Therefore, yesterday, in the name of the Municipal Council, they sent a telegram to the central government, requesting reconsideration, and also sent telegrams to all provincial and municipal councils, advocating for a unified stance. We are now transcribing their telegram to the

central authorities as follows:

To Chairman Jiang and Vice Chairman Sun of the Nanjing National Government,

President Sun and Vice President Wu of the Legislative Yuan, Premier Zhang and Vice Premier Wang of the Executive

Yuan, Your Excellencies: We have recently read in the newspapers of this city dated September 27th that the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party Committee proposed on September 26th to amend the regulations for provincial, city, and county councils, intending

to request, in accordance with the principles of the 12th article of the administrative policy, that the Legislative Yuan amend the regulations for provincial, city, and county councils and provisional councils, using a selection method to

select representatives from various parties to jointly participate in provincial, city, and county councils or provisional councils. As for the number of representatives, it is proposed to be 15 to 20 people for provinces or municipalities directly under the central government, and 5 to 10 people for counties or cities under provincial jurisdiction. This proposal has been passed by the State Council and sent to the Legislative Yuan to be handled according to the original

principles. We are astonished upon reading this. We feel compelled to express our concerns: The regulations for the provincial, city, and county councils in our country have long been promulgated and implemented. The original proposal, based on the 12th article of the administrative policy, requests amendments, which contradicts the principle that laws should not be retroactive.

The Number of Appointed Representatives Hinders Civil Rights

Moreover,

all

provincial, city, and county

senators

are legally

elected by

various provincial, city, and county regional and professional groups according to

population proportions. Once the number of appointed senators is added midway, it directly and indirectly hinders

the exercise of the four rights of the people, treating national laws

as worthless and undermining the government's credibility. In fact,

regardless of provincial, city, and county councils,

the existing senators, although not proportionally allocated among various parties

or social elites, are definitely not limited to any single party. Taking Shanghai as an example, the number of senators with Kuomintang membership is less than 40 percent. Although it has not been investigated whether the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participate, it is evident that the remaining 60 percent are social elites or members of other parties.

Members of Both Parties Can Freely Compete in Elections

If selecting

provincial and municipal

supervisory

committee members,

there is originally

no restriction on party affiliation, and there is no need for senators to be candidates. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party can continue to

compete freely through various methods, seemingly preventing

the issue of having no starting point. Moreover, the government implements

policies with the original intention of returning power to the people, not to

parties. Since the intention is to return power to the people, everything should

be based on the will of the people. Regarding the extension of the terms of the

senators, this is because provincial and municipal councils

will be established through legal elections.

It seems that members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party should strive to promote

this, so that local councils can be

formed. Members of various parties can also participate in elections as soon as possible, realizing the goal of participating in local councils.

Established Regulations Cannot Be Altered

As for the

established

regulations of

provincial, city, and

county councils,

they should absolutely not

be easily altered. This council believes that the State Council

should carefully consider this matter. Besides sending telegrams to the

Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the National Government, and sending notifications to all provincial, city, and county councils to advocate for a unified stance, we hereby state that the regulations of provincial, city, and county councils should not cater to the demands of

party factions and increase the number of appointed representatives,

which would confuse them with those elected, causing

the government to appear to arbitrarily legislate and destroy laws, and to prioritize parties over the people.

We respectfully submit these reasons in a telegram for your review and hope that you will adopt and implement them, as it is in the public interest. President Pan Gongzhan of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Vice President Xu Ji,

respectfully submit this report.

### Council Subcommittee to Review Proposals Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Council's

Fourth General Assembly was held last

week on the sixth. Due to the large number of proposals

for discussion, the meeting was postponed by two days, starting today.

Yesterday was Sunday and a day of rest. Today, a

subcommittee review meeting will be held. The general assembly will continue tomorrow afternoon.

### Volunteer Soldiers Begin Enlistment; Welcome Reception Tomorrow

The Shanghai All Circles Reception and Comfort Committee for Soldiers Transiting and Going to War, recognizing the admirable loyalty and courage of the 3,000 volunteer soldiers in this city who are beginning their enlistment, has specially joined forces with the Shanghai Military Service Association to hold a send-off welcome reception at the Jiangwan

Stadium's new recruit demonstration camp at 9:00 AM on September 30th. The committee has publicly elected Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Yi Tiewu, Shi Beihang, Chuan Zhengmo, Wu Kaixian, Wu Shaoshu,

Xie Renzhao, Zhao Huizhan, Zhang Wei, Zhang Xiaosong,

Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Feng Youzhen, Zheng Yuxiu, Xu Xueyu, Liu Deming,

Liu Yuehan, Zhou Feicheng, and Shui Xiangyun as the chairman group of the assembly, with Mayor Wu Guozhen as the general

chairman. Relatives of the volunteer soldiers have also been invited to participate, to foster camaraderie.

### Huaian Native Place Association Established

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Huaian Native Place Association held its founding assembly yesterday. More than five hundred natives from Huaian attended. Chairman Jiang Jianbai delivered a report. Then, commissioner Fang Lian from the Social Affairs Bureau attended to provide guidance. After electing directors and supervisors, the meeting adjourned.

### Puxi Water Pipe Installation Completed for Three Thousand Meters

[Report from Our Newspaper] The installation of water pipes in the Puxi area

of this city is being actively carried out by the Municipal Public Works Bureau.

Yesterday, an official of the bureau told a reporter: The water pipes, extending

from Bridge No. 6 to the Shi Jian Lan Yan

Wharf along Puxi Avenue, are three thousand meters in length and were completed on the fifteenth of this month. The total cost was approximately 400 million

yuan. Residents in the area who need water can apply for connection immediately. The bureau has decided to continue the water pipe installation project. The planned project is to extend the water pipes to the Yangjing area,

about three miles long. However, the difficulty is the funding issue, which is currently being planned by the municipal government.

### Ordeal in the Barbaric Wilderness on the Border of Tuan Yan; Families of China National Aviation Corporation Crash Victims Recovered Nine Sets of Remains and Transported Them Back to Shanghai; Scattered and Incomplete Bones on the Slope

On March 19th of last year,

China National Aviation Corporation Flight 13

9, flying from Chongqing to

Shanghai, crashed en route.

The fate of the passengers and crew, totaling thirty-

six people, was unknown.

It was not until this summer that it was discovered that the crashed plane was located in the Zhong Zi area of "Tuan Yan." A month ago, the China National Aviation Corporation sent representatives and family members of the victims

to the location on a special plane to search for remains. They transported all the remains back to this city on a special plane, temporarily storing them in the China Funeral Home to prepare for the aftermath.

Yesterday, a reporter met Tao Chang, the representative of the families of the victims of the China National Aviation Corporation Flight 229, who provided the following account: This time, we and other representatives of the families of the China National Aviation Corporation Flight 229 crash victims went to Ebian County's Tuan Yan Mountain to search for remains. We departed from Shanghai on August 22nd, arrived in Chengdu on the 24th, and immediately contacted the provincial government authorities and relevant parties. Because entering the barbaric region was extremely difficult, it was necessary to complete negotiations. On September 4th, we set off for Ebian County.

At that time, western Sichuan was suffering from severe flooding, and the roads were destroyed. Military trucks could only reach Leshan. We then switched to rickshaws and walking, taking three days to reach Ebian County's

Shaping Town. Shaping is only 200 Chinese miles from the site of the Tuan Yan plane crash, but it requires passing through the "old forest," which is seldom visited.

There are many poisonous snakes and wild beasts,

and barbarians roam

the area, abducting people and selling them

as "slaves" to work. Therefore, Han Chinese have disappeared,

considering it a dreaded path. After we arrived at Shaping, we were

hosted by Mo Chengzhi, a local notable and current Sichuan provincial senator. His younger brother, Ge Chaolie,

planned everything for us. According to a report from a barbarian named Zhang Zhian last year, some passengers may still be alive,

having been abducted by barbarians. At that time, Ge placed an

announcement stating that if there were any survivors, he was willing

to offer a ransom for their release. Ge also sent someone to contact the chieftain of the barbarians, Mu Gan'er, explaining our

intentions to avoid misunderstandings. However, after a week,

there was no response. We then decided to bring guns and

venture forth,

led by Ge Chaowei

and a group of local people

and police officers, totaling sixty people. In addition to our family

representatives, there were also China National Aviation Corporation staff member Fan

Yuzhong, Mu Ye Company manager He Runzhi, and Ebian County police captain Xiao Qianxun,

carrying machine guns, submachine guns, rifles, and other weapons, totaling twenty-five

guns, in a group. In the "old forest,"

there were mostly cypress and fir trees, towering above the clouds, with bamboo lining the paths,

blocking out the sunlight. After traveling like this for three days, we

reached the border of Tuan Yan. As we approached the plane crash site, we suddenly saw several barbarians melting

the lead from the plane's wings. Seeing us, they shouted "

Chicken Pounced on the Ground," meaning that the barbarians wanted to tie people up,

and used

their barbarian knives to chop

at us fiercely. Another barbarian immediately

fired three shots, fortunately

missing. We immediately fired back and set up

the machine guns. Seeing that they were no match for us, the barbarians rolled

into the forest. At that time, a heavy fog filled the air, and they disappeared.

We then ordered people to guard the entrances while

rushing to the plane crash site to search for bodies

The plane crashed into a small rock on a flat dam,

and the bodies were scattered on the nearby slopes. Because it had been

so long, the bones were scattered and disorganized. We quickly collected them

at that time. Because we didn't know how many barbarians there were, fearing

that they would come again in force, we

quickly retreated

and rushed back to the

camp from the previous day to

ensure safety. The next day, we offered a generous reward,

gathering volunteers to search again. As a result, we only found

nine sets of remains, all incomplete. This was very different from the original

number of passengers. Because the time since the incident

was already a year and a half, the bodies were scattered and difficult

to collect.

### Conspiracy to Sabotage Power; Police Bureau Offers Reward for Fugitive

The Municipal Police Bureau issued a public

notice yesterday stating: "After investigation, it was found that communist

subversives in this city were conspiring

to cause trouble, attempting to sabotage

power and create terror.

Previously, the Municipal Security Bureau seized important documents and arrested conspiracy offenders, including electrical worker

Wu Kewen and fourteen others. There are still fifteen fugitives, including Ouyang Zirun, who have not been captured.

It is reported that the police bureau has received a tip that the offenders not only do not regret their actions, but are also inciting

workers of the French Electric Tram Company and the British Electric Military Company to continue their strike in order to achieve their failed

objective. This is extremely illegal. We have ordered all subordinates to strictly arrest all the fugitives

and bring them to justice. A reward of ten million yuan will be offered for the arrest of Ouyang Zirun. For the arrest of the remaining fourteen people, including Li Yuanfu, Yang

Jinlong, Wang Yukun, Wan Shichang, Qian Shaohe, Li Zhensheng, Shen Xiangsheng, Wu Ze, Li Yi

tian, Ding Buyun, Yu Jiqing, Yang Yugen, Ni Renbao, and Liang Jinquan, each reward is five

million yuan. Half of the reward will be given to those who provide information leading to the arrest."

### Shanghai-Nanjing Express Train Separates; Delay Caused by Accident, Fortunately No Injuries

The 12th

Shanghai-Nanjing night express sleeper train departed

from Shanghai for Nanjing

at 11:00 PM. Yesterday,

at 0:35 AM,

when passing Zhengyi Station, the "Tiger Hook" connecting the fifth and sixth carriages behind the locomotive

suddenly broke due to the vibration. At that time, the train separated into two sections. The first half of the train did not notice the accident and continued

to travel. Fortunately, the train conductor managed to signal and stop the train. After Zhengyi Station dispatched a rescue train

to tow it back to the station, repairs were completed at 6:45 AM, resulting in a delay

of more than two hours. The other trains, such as Train 16, were also delayed as a result. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries.

### Improving Agricultural Production and Increasing Exports to Overcome Current Economic Difficulties; Ge Jingzhong Speaks on "How China Can Achieve Economic Self-Reliance"

Mr. Ge Jingzhong During his Broadcast (Photo by Our Newspaper)

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this newspaper held its 26th Sunday special broadcast at the Gospel Radio Station. Mr. Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Silk Company, spoke on "How China Can Achieve Economic Self-Reliance." The main points of his speech are recorded below:

Recently, the Chinese economy has encountered many difficult

problems. Not only are we ourselves anxious, but our allied countries

are also extremely concerned. This can be seen from Wedemeyer's

report. At this difficult

time, we are putting forward the slogan of "self-reliance." The

so-called "self-reliance" is not intended to be isolationist.

International relations are now very close. We need to import

materials that we lack from other countries, and other countries also need

to export materials that they lack from our country. An isolationist policy can no longer adapt to

the current situation.

Self-Reliance to Regulate Trade

For example,

when the exchange rate

is high, prices also rise. When the exchange rate is low,

prices also fall. Also, China is an agricultural country.

To build it into an industrial country, we must purchase foreign

machinery. Therefore, when we talk about self-reliance now, it is about how to regulate our foreign trade,

which is about how to adjust exports and imports.

In short, it is about how to expand and increase our country's

exports in order to exchange for foreign imports, so that they can

be balanced. China is an agricultural country, and 80-90% of its products are agricultural products. Therefore, most of our exports

are tea, silk, tung oil, and pig bristles. Before the "September 18th Incident," soybeans were the top export. In 1937,

China's exports and imports were not very different. Unfortunately, the war broke out and lasted for eight years.

Export Quality Must Be Excellent

After

victory, we

also encountered domestic unrest. Therefore, there has been a huge trade deficit recently. The most tragic month last year,

the trade deficit reached 90%, meaning that exports were only worth 10% and imports were worth

100%. According to the latest customs announcement, the trade deficit is approximately 45%. On the surface, it seems that the situation has improved, but in reality,

because the use of foreign exchange is restricted, many luxurious or excessively valuable

items have been temporarily stopped from being imported. Some may ask, "Can we reduce imports and

balance them with exports?" This is impossible. When it comes to construction, it is essential to import machinery.

When there is a disaster, it is essential to import rice from Southeast Asia and cotton from India. Since reducing imports is impossible, we can only

try our best to expand exports. This raises the issue of quality and quantity.

The quality of exports must be excellent and scientific. For example, the tea leaves from Taiwan,

after scientific roasting, are very popular when shipped to the United States and Canada. If the Chinese mainland

were to use scientific methods for roasting, would the export of tea leaves not increase significantly?

Purchasing Agricultural Products while Considering Costs

Expanding

foreign trade

by improving quality is a fundamental solution,

but it is too slow. To solve the urgent problem, the quantity

must be increased. There is a simple method for this.

That is, the prices of products purchased from farmers must take their costs into account. For each agricultural product,

the labor, fertilizer, capital, and interest involved in the production process must be accurately calculated.

If we purchase materials from farmers based on these costs, they will naturally be happy

to sell, and without encouraging them to increase production, they will naturally increase production. If the purchase price does not cover the cost,

and we force them to sell, then the farmers would rather cut down the tea trees and mulberry trees to burn as firewood than do business at a loss.

Not Incurring Foreign Debt for Construction

Therefore,

if the

government wants to increase production and expand foreign trade, it must conduct a detailed investigation into the costs

of agricultural products. This is the most appropriate method and also a method for increasing quantity.

When foreign trade expands, we can exchange our

agricultural products for foreign industrial products. This way,

we can carry out construction without incurring foreign debt. This

is the true meaning of economic self-reliance. To realize

this true meaning, we must find ways to improve

the quality and quantity of our agricultural products, increase exports, and

overcome the current economic difficulties.

### Dance Industry Depressed, Restaurants Flourishing, Chicken and Duck Prices Soaring, Mooncakes Selling Well – Different Reactions to Thrift During the Festival

[Special Report from This Newspaper] After two emergency general meetings and three large-scale petitions by the city's dance industry, one dance hall manager said with a hint of loss, "Seeing the bright moon about to be full these past two days, our hearts are filled with indescribable sadness.  Every year, from Mid-Autumn Festival to Christmas, is a golden period for the dance industry; now, just when everyone should be joyfully welcoming the Mid-Autumn Festival, we are struggling to overcome a crisis of survival!"

These words are quite melancholic.  In the past month alone, they have abandoned the splendor and luxury they had painstakingly cultivated for over thirty years: neon lights dismantled, flower baskets disappeared, fragrant champagne no longer seen, and dazzling sterling silver utensils have begun to gather dust.  The dance floors are indeed "thrifty" now, but what about outside the dance floors?

Fashion stores have autumn outfits costing nearly ten million yuan, and restaurants have lavish banquets costing two million yuan per table.  Dance patrons and dancers, unable to enjoy themselves inside, naturally turn to these places as their ideal destinations.  Restaurants are full of sea cucumbers and shark fins, aged Shaoxing wine, and Huadiao wine. If they want to indulge in intoxication, they can still feast to their heart's content, even though these are expressly restricted under the banner of thrift.

The "thrift" in the dance halls has unexpectedly led to the prosperity of restaurants, but this is limited to only thirty-odd larger restaurants.  The more than seven hundred ordinary restaurants in the city are fearing the threat of "no tips allowed" brought about by the thrift campaign.  The waiters in the restaurants that sell set meals are not paid a salary. What happens when their source of income from tips is cut off, leading to labor disputes?

The restaurant industry, generally speaking, is not interested in the Mid-Autumn Festival, which is the same melancholy shared by mooncake merchants. Last year, they had pagoda mooncakes and battleship mooncakes, magnificent and beautiful, decorating Shanghai with the joyous scene of family reunions. But times have changed, and a "Cloud Dress Fairy Moon" mooncake priced at 500,000 yuan stands alone in the city. Onlookers cannot help but feel disappointed, and oldtimers naturally feel even more shabby. Thus, they order their staff to put on smiling faces and explain apologetically to those who stop to look: "It's because we are complying with the price restrictions!" Finally, they add, "Next year, we will definitely make a huge, beautiful one!"

Whether customers are "inspired" by this kind of sales pitch is unknown, but people are frantically buying mooncakes, five boxes, ten boxes, coconut filling, jujube paste filling, the "mooncake mountain" piled on the counter gradually shrinking. One housewife-like customer anxiously says, "Hurry! I need to deliver these gifts today, or I'll be considered disrespectful tomorrow!"

Presumably, those receiving gifts are not practicing gratitude or refusal because of thrift, so the price of ducks has risen from 8,000 yuan to 24,000 yuan per catty. Pork has also doubled in price, and vegetables, oil, sugar, and the seven necessities of life have all increased in price. Everyone refuses to bow their heads to "thrift." Are they really prepared to hold on to their belts to enjoy the moon? In reality, most people are struggling to make ends meet. Are they just going through the motions for the holiday? Nine out of ten people giving gifts will solemnly say, "Because it's thrifty now, otherwise the gifts would have been even more elaborate!"

Those who are truly anxious about the thrift movement are the bands that play music at weddings, funerals, and celebrations, as well as many newly emerging artisans who make flower baskets and wreaths. They are all worried about their fate after the Mid-Autumn Festival. They once said with great emotion, "In the Qing Dynasty, even a low-ranking official of the seventh rank supported many idle people: sedan chair carriers, heralds, gate openers, cannon firers... These were professions passed down through generations. Later, when these duties were abolished, their entire families fell into despair!" The speaker meant to compare this to his current situation, but one of the listeners interrupted, "Those people did not all commit suicide or starve to death after their jobs were abolished. I have personally seen many of their descendants change professions and become wealthy!"

Everyone is busily spending the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Mid-Autumn full moon will once again shine on these people – regardless of whether they are happy or sad!

### "Reader Scholarship Fund" Highest Individual Donation Record: Lu Shoulun Raises Funds, Yongyi Generously Donates 30 Million

Dear Readers,

If you are not forgetful, you will surely remember the enthusiastic support of Mr. Yongyi Guangsheng for scholarships in the past. This was already five years ago, when our motherland was under the enemy's iron heel, and the people were suffering in deep waters and hot fires, groaning in agony. In order to uphold the justice of the nation and for the future fate of the motherland, the "Reader Scholarship Fund" burst forth with brilliant sparks at that time, illuminating the future for the hesitant youth in the boundless darkness of enemy rule.

"As long as the stone is there, the spark will not die out." Countless enthusiastic people participated in our scholarship work, contributing money if they had it, and strength if they had it, and Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] was one of them.

Although the motherland's war of resistance has been won, the war against the communists has begun, and countless young people are still earnestly hoping for relief. Therefore, countless enthusiastic people have once again started scholarship work.

This time, Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] generously donated 30 million yuan, adding a new force to the "Reader Scholarship Fund". In terms of individual donations, Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] has undoubtedly broken the highest record again. Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] is a hardworking entrepreneur, a longtime reader of the Shen Bao. His career is both beneficial to the country and the people, and his diligence, simplicity, and benevolence are especially commendable.

Here, we would like to extend our highest gratitude to Mr. Yongyi and Mr. Lu (Note: It was Mr. Lu Shoulun who raised the funds) on behalf of countless poor and struggling students. (Editor's note) The famous Shanghai painter and calligrapher Feng Chaoran has specially created a landscape painting for us, and designated that this painting should be given to the person who donates the most money, to show our admiration and commemoration. Now that the "Reader Scholarship Fund" is nearing its end, the facts show us that this valuable landscape painting will be respectfully presented to Mr. Yongyi [Guangsheng]. I think readers must be very familiar with Mr. Feng's works. He has a lofty position in the art world, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the president of our newspaper, will add a postscript to it, adding a lot of luster to this painting. We believe that it is indeed a very honorable thing for a philanthropist like Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] to own this valuable work.

### Fleas in Shandong

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] When the National Army was approaching Yingxi County, Shandong, a Wang couple in the city whispered while going to bed: "The Central Army is coming soon!" The next day, the couple was arrested. The bandit army tied their thumbs with ropes and hung them high in the treetops for interrogation: "Now let you see the Central Army!" Then they cut the ropes and shot them dead on the spot. This crime and punishment is called "Looking at the Central Army".

This matter was told to the reporter by He Zhihao, a battlefield inspector specially appointed by the Chairman of the National Government. He was dispatched to inspect the Shandong war zone and has been in the front line for two months. He told reporters that before the National Army captured Feicheng, the communist bandits convened a mass meeting to discuss a proposal to burn the entire village.

When the villagers raised their hands to vote, the chairman declared: "The Communist Party is democratic and wants to seek everyone's consent before doing something. Now we want to burn the houses. Does everyone agree?" The crowd was terrified and did not answer. The chairman said again: "The Communist Party is the most democratic. Burning houses must be approved by everyone's opinion!" The crowd was even more terrified, looking at each other in silence. At this time, the chairman turned red, stared, and shouted sternly: "The Communist Party is the most democratic. Burning houses is also for the benefit of the people. The people's affairs must be agreed to by the people, but the thoughts of older people are always backward. Let's see what the opinions of the new forces, the children, are!" So, the "Children's Team" raised their hands in favor, and it was passed as a majority. This is an example of the Communist Party's "democracy". If the ancient Greek philosophers who created the political theory of democracy knew that the Chinese Communist Party today practices "democracy" in this way, they would definitely laugh and cry!

"Dividing the houses" is a seductive slogan. The poor were delighted when they first heard it, but the communist bandits had a strange way of "equalizing wealth": the masses gathered in front of the mansion, and after a meeting and vote, the houses were immediately demolished. The target of the liquidation became a pile of rubble. The masses who struggled were divided into broken bricks and broken pillars. The communist bandits had completed another act of destruction. This kind of "equalization of wealth" has caused the tragedy of ten cities out of ten empty in many towns in Shandong.

What the people fear most is the communist bandit's census.

Before the census, the bandits sent spies into the houses in advance. At night, the census team fought outside and shouted, "Check the household registration!" If the family wanted to hide a strong man or hide some food, the bandit hiding in the house would see everything clearly, and the result would inevitably be severe punishment.

A certain division commander stationed in the Yimeng Mountain area said when entertaining the inspectors: "You have been bumping around on the front line, contacting only soldiers. Now I will give you a little adjustment and ask you to take a look at the women!" Sure enough, the guards were ordered to bring a woman. Everyone looked at her and almost vomited. It was a Russian old woman captured by the division from the bandit army.

She wore a Chinese cheongsam, covered in dirt, with no expression on her face. No matter how you questioned her, she didn't say a word. Old, ugly, and disgusting, she was like a witch in a Grimm's fairy tale. Searching her body for documents, it was known that she had been active in the Northeast. If she really couldn't speak Chinese, she must have had a translator working for the bandit army, and there must be more than just one Russian!

In the captured bandit army's battle order, there was a paragraph: "Fight with what gun you have, fight against what enemy, fight at what time and place." It seems that Chen Yi, that fellow, only specializes in fighting messy battles.

The National Army's Russian woman captured from the bandit army in the Yimeng Mountain area (sent by Shaochuan)

His main force has been looking for the weakness of the National Army, trying to harvest the effect of annihilation in mobile warfare, but the communist party's sugar-coated poison pill has been fed to the people of Shandong, and it has ruined its own political life. The people in the "liberated areas" don't want you! They are not afraid of you using the severe torture of "Looking at the Central Army". They still want the Central Army! The folk song "Down with Mao Zedong, everyone will have merit" hit the mark. Coupled with the advance of the loyal and brave National Army, dozens of dark "liberated area" towns and villages have been restored. Now, the remaining bandits in the border areas can only act as flea-like harassment, and it will not be difficult to clear them in the short term. (Special Correspondent Hang Shaochuan)

Facts:

Liu Keming, Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, and Zhang Shaoyun were all members of the 29th Army Officer Training Corps. They retired successively between April and May of this year and stayed in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, where they organized a gang. Pu Yuzhou, carrying his family, resided in the home of Zou Wu Shi at No. 5 West Bank, Tongli Town, Wujiang County, making a living by selling drugs. He knew that the Chen family next door was relatively well-off, that her husband had passed away, and that her sons and nephews were doing business elsewhere. The Chen family consisted only of Chen and her daughter Zou Yue'e, and they were isolated and unable to resist. Pu Yuzhou then conspired with Liu, Peng, Zhang, and Zhou Tianquan, a member of the 17th Company of the 5th Battalion of the Training Corps, to carry out a robbery. They planned that on the afternoon of June 4th of this year, at about 4:00 PM, Liu Keming would go to the Zou residence, falsely claiming to be unable to find a house to rent, and deposit his luggage there, as a pretext for entering the house at night. The Chen mother and daughter were suspicious and asked their cousin Zou Bingcheng to stay with them that night. That night at around 9:00 PM, Liu Keming, Zhou Tianquan, Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, Zhang Shaoyun, Peng Ming, Li Pengyun, Chen Lizhong, [blank] Jia, Hu Zhan [blank] Liao Bingming and others, carrying guns, went to carry out the plan, claiming to retrieve the luggage. The Zou residence fell into their trap and opened the gate. The bandits successively rushed in five people, Peng Hengda jumped over the wall into the inner room.  The gang immediately forced Zou Bingcheng to call out to open the second door, and Pu Hengda and Tong Tianquan and others bound Chen's daughter and Zou Bingcheng and his wife together. Because Zou Yue'e shouted for help, Liu used a yardstick to push cotton into her mouth, and then raped her, causing Yue'e to suffocate and die. The [blank] and others robbed the Chen family of seven gold rings and one gold bracelet, and Zou Bingcheng of one gold ring, before fleeing. Zou Chen reported the incident to the Wujiang District Prosecutor's Office, which verified that Zou Yue'e had been raped before death and suffocated, as recorded in the files. The 29th Army Officer Training Corps, upon receiving the report, together with the mayor of Tongli Town, arrested Tong Tianquan, Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, Zhang Shaoyun, Liu Keming, and suspects Pu Pan Shi, Liu Guozhang, Liu Jun, Zhang Yi [blank] and others and escorted them to the case.

The Five Executed Criminals: Liu Keming, Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, Zhang Shaoyun, Zhou Tianquan.

The reasons for this case are described in detail below:

(A) Regarding Liu Keming, Pu Yuzhou, Zhou Tianquan, Peng Hengda, and Zhang Shaoyun: Although the defendants were cunning and did not confess to the facts listed on the right, the files show that Zhou Tianquan confessed in the Officer Training Corps: "That day it was almost dark, I ran into Liu Keming on the bridge, and then I met Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, Zhang Shaoyun, Peng Ming, etc. We went to the Zou family together. Liu Keming called the door, and an old grandmother opened the door. Everyone went in. We ran into the old lady, Liu Keming looked for Zou Yue'e, first he argued with her, and then he punched her. She ran away, and Liu also followed her in. Peng Hengda and Liu Keming tied her up. Pu Yuzhou and Zhang Shaoyun stood at the door, and the rest stood in the courtyard. Liu Keming held her down (referring to the deceased) and used a ruler to shove cotton in her mouth" (see Officer Training Corps file, June 11th record). Liu Keming confessed: "On June 3rd, at Pu Yuzhou's house, Pu said that the Zou family didn't have many people, and they had a lot of gold and cash. We could go and do a job and make some money. On the morning of the 4th, we planned to do it at night. We gathered at the entrance of Pu's house. Two people from Tongli each brought guns. Li Pengju, Fan Qikui, and Ran Qixi and I also brought guns. There was probably a lock set inside" (see Officer Training Corps investigation file, June 12th record). Pu Yuzhou confessed: "Liu Keming brought the quilt in. He used the excuse of putting the quilt down so that he could go at night. Liu Keming and Zhang Shaoyun were the ones who kicked the door open and went in. They told me that they were going to rob the Zou family tonight. I replied that they shouldn't hurt anyone. They told me to look at the back door. Zou Yue'e shouted loudly, and Liu Keming stuffed her mouth with cotton," etc. (see Officer Training Corps file, June 12th record). Questioning the plaintiff, Zou Chen Shi, she stated: "They first tied my daughter in the room for half an hour. One of them came out, wiping his sweat, it looked like him (referring to Liu Keming), the one who brought the bedding during the day, and the one who came over from Pu's side door first, it was also him. This person (referring to Zhou Tianquan) tied me up and asked me for money and gold." Zou Shen Shi, the deceased Zou Yue'e's sister-in-law, stated: "That day at two o'clock, [blank] from the Pu family came over, I opened the door, the one who entered the [blank] house was him" (referring to Liu Keming) (see Wujiang District Court file, page 69). Jin Shan Quan (also known as Jin Xiaosu, the deceased's nephew) stated: "That night he (referring to Zhou Tianquan) tied up my grandmother and stuffed cotton in her mouth, that's absolutely correct." Further investigation of Pu Yuzhou's drug dealing, Zou Wu Shi (Pu's landlord) stated: "Many people came and went to Pu's house. At night, I smelled a scent, a white powder scent (i.e., heroin). [Blank] three often came and went. I had eaten it for a few days when I was thirty years old, so I smelled the white powder" (see court file, page 63). Peng Hengda confessed: "Someone surnamed Ran said that he had white flour to buy at his house. Liu Keming confessed: "The one who runs the white flour business in Tongli Hall told me that his family sells white flour" (see record of joint trial by this Ministry). Although Peng Hengda vehemently denied being involved in the robbery and claimed that he had already returned home that night and had not gone out, and that the landlord opened the door, which could serve as proof to the contrary, Peng's landlord Xue Shen Shi stated: "Peng went out after dark that night and didn't come back until 11:00." Moreover, Zou Bingcheng pointed out: "There are two Zhang Shaoyuns there, I am numbers three, four, and five, living at number 22, Jincheng Hotel, Suzhou, and numbers 6, staying at the garrison of the 145th Division in Laolumen" (see the original file of the town office), and also called the orderly Tian Yun at the garrison (see file [blank] page 28). After detailed verification of the Jincheng Hotel's log, there was no registration of Zhang Shaoyun staying there, and the garrison of the 145th Division had no person named Tian Yun (see Wujiang County Government telegram of August 19). Zhang Yixun stated: "The Zhang Shaoyun who lives in Zhenze is very old, and I watched a play with him at the Zhenze Theater on the evening of June 4th." Pu Yuzhou stated: "This Zhang Shaoyun was definitely captured" (see court file, page 38), etc. The evidence to the contrary presented by Peng Hengda and Zhang Shaoyun is insufficient to prove their claims. Furthermore, they have been clearly identified by the victims and accomplices, so their empty words of sophistry and denial of responsibility cannot be accepted. After reviewing the entire file, the defendants either confessed frankly, or were clearly identified by the victims, and the evidence corroborates each other. They are all principals in the commission of the crime, and there is no doubt about it. Considering their actions, Zhou Tianquan is a soldier and should be convicted of colluding to rob. The deceased Zou Yue'e was verified to have been raped, and it was Liu Keming who dragged her to the ground in the hall, and left only after half an hour. It is extremely clear that Liu is the principal offender in the rape, and he should be convicted of both robbery resulting in intentional homicide and robbery resulting in rape. However, because these acts arose from a single act of robbery, the more serious charge of jointly robbing and intentionally killing should be applied. Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, and Zhang Shaoyun should be convicted of jointly robbing and intentionally killing. Furthermore, Pu Yuzhou sold drugs, which has been corroborated by multiple testimonies and is therefore reliable. He should be convicted of selling drugs. These charges should be considered separately and punished concurrently with the charge of jointly robbing and intentionally killing, as the intent of each crime is different.

(B) Regarding Liu Guozhang, Liu Jun, Zhang Yishou, and Pu Pan Shi: After repeated investigations of Liu Guozhang, Liu Jun, Zhang Yishou, and Pu Pan Shi, they have all vehemently denied participating in the robbery. Neither the victims nor the principals Liu Keming, Zhou Tianquan, and Pu Yuzhou have implicated them as accomplices. It should be considered that the evidence of their guilt is insufficient to prove their involvement in the crime, and they should all be found not guilty.

Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 2, Item 5 of the Provisional Emergency Military and Political Measures for the Pacification Zone and the Nine Northeastern Provinces, Article 1, Article 2, the first paragraph of Article 8 of the Wartime Army, Navy, and Air Force Summary Trial Regulations, Article 291 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the first paragraph of Article 293, Article 84, Article 15 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, Article 2, Item 1, Clause 6 and Clause 8, Article 9 and Article 51, Clause 1 and Clause 8, Article 37, Clause 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, judgment is rendered as stated in the main text. August, 1936 of the Republic of China. Joint deliberation and judgment by Presiding Judge Zhang [blank] Sheng, Judge Liu Mengjiu, and Du Mulu.

### Opinions on Hu Shih's Ten-Year Education Plan by Cheng Hsiaogang

Each school has its own unique strengths. The dentistry of West China University and the agriculture of Nanking University are strengths not possessed by Peking University and the other four. In developing academic pursuits, one should focus on these special departments and assist their development, so that they can achieve first-class international academic status.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Cheng Hsiaogang, the new president of Jiaotong University, arrived in Shanghai the other day and stayed at the Yangzi Telegraph Office Guesthouse. He is scheduled to take office at the university this morning.

Mr. Cheng, in response to questions from reporters at the guesthouse yesterday, stated the following: Since the end of the war, the number of faculty and students at Jiaotong University has increased dramatically. The existing facilities have been unable to keep up with the current needs, which has had a significant impact on teaching and learning. Everyone shares this sentiment. This individual is now in charge of the university administration and is eager to gain cooperation and assistance from all sides in developing the university's affairs in the future, focusing on concrete actions. It is futile to engage in empty talk at this time without immediate results. However, I can say that both myself and others connected to Jiaotong University hope to restore the university's previous high academic standards in the short term, enhance the students' desire for learning. The Ministry of Education has already increased the number of professors by more than a hundred this semester. The equipment donated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will also be very helpful for teaching experiments. In terms of funding, in addition to the Ministry of Education, we have also approached various parties for donations, hoping to improve the welfare of faculty and students as much as possible. As for the various matters already decided by the Jiaotong University Reorganization Committee, Mr. Cheng stated that he would not make any changes. Mr. Cheng then expressed his opinion on the ten-year education plan of Hu Shih, the president of Peking University, saying that universities include a wide range of departments, and each school has its own unique strengths. The dentistry of West China University and the agriculture of Nanking University are strengths not possessed by Peking University and the other four. In developing academic pursuits, one should focus on these special departments and assist their development, so that they can achieve first-class international academic status, and one name cannot replace its position. He believes that the division of labor in science is becoming increasingly detailed and beneficial. In agricultural studies, there is the field of botany, and within botany, there are the departments of plant diseases and entomology. For example, the cotton produced in Dali, Yunnan, is of very good quality, growing taller than a person, but it is often damaged by pests and diseases, preventing large-scale production. In other areas, the losses caused by pests and diseases to our country's annual cotton, wheat, and rice production are countless, yet no one pays attention to researching prevention and control measures, which is very regrettable. Speaking of engineering, the division of labor is also detailed, and the achievements of various schools vary. The government should develop them separately based on the strengths of each school. Mr. Cheng hopes to replace Hu Shih's ten-year education plan with this idea. He pointed out: This can build on the existing foundation of each school, making it easier for greater development and allowing universities to compete with each other. It can also equalize funding and avoid regional disputes.

### Group A Volleyball League: Yongsha Wins the Championship; Huayan Loses After a Five-Set Battle

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the GuoZhen Cup, the Yongsha volleyball team has won the Group A championship in the second Volleyball League. They achieved six wins in six matches. In last night's final, they once again defeated Huayan in a dramatic five-set battle. After falling behind 1-2, Yongsha quickly rallied, winning two consecutive sets to come from behind and secure a 3-2 victory, which is highly gratifying. Huayan initially impressed, winning the first set and then taking a 2-1 lead. Unfortunately, in the extremely tense situation of the fourth set, when the score was tied at 19-19, they failed to seize the victory and allowed Yongsha to score two points, leading to a 21-19 score and a 2-2 tie, resulting in a decisive fifth set, which was a pity for Huayan. During the decisive fifth set, the atmosphere was tense. At first, the score was tied at 7-7 and 8-8, but Yongsha then pulled ahead with an 11-8 lead. As the score reached 17-11, Yongsha seemed destined to win. Huayan's ZhiJi served and scored four consecutive points, bringing the score to 17-15 and increasing the tension. Then, the score reached 19-17. Just when it seemed that Huayan could not rally, Yongsha scored two consecutive points to complete the victory. Last night, neither Yongsha nor Huayan showed any particularly outstanding performance, nor did Huayan seem destined to lose. The difference was slight.

The sporting ability last night was suddenly apparent, with about six or seven hundred people coming to watch the final. In the women's group, Fuhua defeated Jinde, and in the two Group B matches, Shangyu Huaqing won.

Last Night's Results

Shangyu defeated Lianxing (Group B1).

Huaqing defeated Jinrui (Group B2) 22-20, 22-20.

### Tao Guanyu and McLagan Fail to Determine a Winner in the Semifinals; Mrs. Ye Guanziong Gains Right to the Women's Singles Final

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the second day of the open tennis championship semi-finals. Due to the exciting and intense program and the cooler weather, the crowd at the Shanghai Tennis Club on Wuyuan Road reached over 800 people, which is unprecedented for a tennis match. It started at 2:00 p.m. In the senior singles semi-finals, the continuation of the fifth set between Wang Wenzheng and Zhou Guanjun saw Zhou Guanjun take a 3-1 lead. Unexpectedly, he lost five consecutive games, and Wang Wenzheng won with a score of 6-3, eliminating Zhou Guanjun with a total score of 3-2 and gaining a spot in the finals. Zhou Guanjun's loss was a great pity. In another match, Tao Guanyu vs. McLagan, unexpectedly, the two players fought to a 2-2 tie, failing to determine a winner. Due to the darkening sky, they agreed to continue the match at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, with the previous scores nullified. This is a match worthy of attention. In the women's singles semi-finals, Mrs. Ying Guanziong eliminated the Western player Miss Green with a score of 2-0. In the intermediate singles, Sun Yifang defeated Jia Zhen with a score of 2-1 to gain a spot in the finals. Little Gu had more experience, but Sun Yifang came from behind to win.

Intermediate Singles Match

Women's Singles Semi-Finals

In the women's group, Mrs. Ye, Ms. Yang WeiBin, and Miss Pan LuFu competed fiercely. Pan won three consecutive games in one breath, causing the entire audience to lose hope. Fortunately, Yang regained her form later and won the first set 6-4. In the second set, Pan's resistance was weak, and Yang won again with a score of 6-3. Yang advanced to the final week with a straight two sets and will compete with Zhu Zhiying for the title of women's group champion.

McLagan Battle

In another men's senior singles semi-final, Tao Guanyu battled McLagan. Tao relied on his skilled technique and easily won the first set 6-2. However, McLagan refused to show weakness, and in the second set, he frequently scored with forehand shots, causing Tao to struggle. McLagan then won the set 6-4. In the third set, McLagan lost momentum again, and Tao easily won 6-2. Everyone thought Tao would win in one go, but unexpectedly, at 4-4, McLagan scored two consecutive games and won the set 6-4, resulting in a 2-2 tie. Due to the darkening sky, both sides agreed to nullify the previous scores and replay the match at the original venue at 3:30 p.m. this Thursday.

Today's Doubles

Today is the third

day of the semi-finals, starting at

3:30 p.m. The first group is the preliminary singles match between Gu Jiazhen and Chen Cuixiang. Gu had reached the semi-finals in the intermediate group but unfortunately lost to Sun Yifang yesterday. He has high hopes for this preliminary championship.

The second match is the semi-final doubles match between Wang Wenzheng and Tao Guanyu vs. Cai Guochun and Liang Saikui. Tao's group is the hegemon of Shanghai, while Cai and Liang's group is a rising star. They defeated Peng Nabivich and McLagan in the semi-finals, so there should be a fierce battle. Tickets are changed to one or two ten thousand yuan and are not numbered. The schedule is as follows:

Gu Jiazhen vs. Chen Cuixiang (Preliminary) 3:30 p.m.

Tao Guanyu Cai Guoheng

vs.

Wang Wenzheng Liang BaoKui

(Doubles) 4:30 p.m.

### Textile Adjustment Committee Will Cooperate with Municipal Authorities to Crack Down on Yarn and Cloth Hoarding and Speculation, Starting with Inventory Checks and Registration

According to a statement by the person in charge of the Textile Adjustment Committee: The implementation plan for adjusting the supply and demand of yarn and cloth has been announced and implemented. In order to stabilize yarn prices, the committee has decided to severely crack down on hoarding and speculation of yarn and cloth based on this plan. The primary task is to conduct inventory checks of yarn and cloth on the market together with the municipal authorities, starting today. According to regulations, the amount of cotton yarn stored by each factory should be sufficient for three months of use by the factory. Yarn number storage shall not exceed forty-five days. Cloth merchants shall not store more than twice the amount of cloth they sell in their peak months. Overdue and excessive amounts will be seized and prosecuted as hoarding and speculation. The government will then purchase them at negotiated prices to suppress their illegal profits. Regarding the crackdown on speculative transactions in yarn and cloth, the Textile Adjustment Committee will dispatch personnel at any time together with the municipal government to secretly investigate the cotton yarn and cloth market. If any acts of monopoly, speculative buying and selling, or short selling are discovered, they will be reported and punished. The registration of cotton yarn and cloth inventory, the registration of cotton yarn and cloth businesses, and the registration of cotton yarn reproduction industries will be carried out separately.

### Cotton Yarn Negotiated Pricing Method Extended to Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou

In order to suppress cotton yarn prices, the Textile Adjustment Committee will extend the cotton yarn negotiated pricing method to Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The committee will set up branches in the above three cities to handle matters according to Shanghai standards. For those transported via the Beijing-Shanghai route, transportation costs and profits will be added. If local producers are involved, prices will be negotiated with reference to local production costs and market conditions, and reported to the committee for record. This will be implemented in a short period of time.

### Black Market Cannot Be Eliminated, Overseas Remittances Cannot Enter the Right Track

[Our Newspaper's Report] Relevant sources stated: The total amount of overseas remittances in July was over US$190,000. The statistics for August have not yet been compiled, but it is estimated that there will not be a significant increase or decrease. This figure is higher than before foreign exchange was listed, but it has not reached the expected hope. The key lies in the failure of the black market and the official exchange rate to align. Especially in areas close to our country, such as the Philippines and Southeast Asia, they are particularly sensitive to the difference between the black market and the official exchange rate. At the same time, the inflow of overseas remittances into the black market has become a habit, and it will not be possible to reverse this situation in a day. According to experts' estimates, before the war, 70% of our country's overseas remittances came from Southeast Asia and 30% from the United States and the United Kingdom. During the Pacific War, the entire territory of Southeast Asia fell, but our country's monthly overseas remittance income was still around US$10 million. If overseas remittances can be brought into the right track, the monthly amount could reach over US$40 million.

### US Short-Term Treasury Bills Will Be Exchanged for Bonds Starting Today

The exchange will begin today. Those who have subscribed for treasury bill subscription vouchers can go directly to the original sales agency to exchange them.

### Knitting and Talent Selection

— Ping

Qiu Ping and the knitting school have been around for a decade. Over the years, we have taught over a thousand students. Here, I will discuss some of my teaching experiences and my thoughts on talent selection:

Years of war caused the interruption of the wool industry. Consequently, knitting essentially came to a halt. Now, with the restoration of our nation, the wool industry has reached its peak in recent years. Since the start of autumn, newly opened yarn shops have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain, lined up on Jing'an Temple Road and Xiafei Road, as dense as stars in the sky. Thus, there is a great shortage of knitting talent. All of the students in the current 24th class have been hired to serve the community, providing free instruction to customers in order to achieve a thorough understanding of the art of knitting. However, the path to art is not limited to rigid and uninspired methods. It requires the selection of agile minds and the achievement of skills. Factors such as color coordination and the rules of contour rely on genius and wisdom, as well as continuous research, in order to achieve perfection. Therefore, the ladies who take on the role of knitting instructors must also examine their own cultivation, such as the effect of a warm and fulfilling personality! This includes gentle speech, graceful demeanor, and an upright appearance. However, this is not a necessary element among the conditions. As for respect for the shop owner and humility towards colleagues, it should be like a new bride's willingness to consider everything, maintaining an appropriate attitude and remaining a typical lady!

### Wild Chrysanthemum Cushion

— Autumn

Knitting art has developed considerably in recent years, partly due to continuous research and partly due to the widespread use of plush materials. Besides being used for coats, vests, and children's clothing, it is also widely used in decorations. This is a cushion woven with a wild chrysanthemum pattern, suitable for sofas, chartered cars, and automobiles, providing a comfortable backrest in all seasons. Not only is the pattern beautiful, but the colors also complement each other, making it elegant and durable. It can also be washed, disassembled, and altered, making it both economical and aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, high-class families generally use this novel cushion to decorate their halls. As for other knitted items such as bedsheets and coarse cloth pillowcases, whether as gifts for relatives and friends or for everyday use, they are both beautiful and unique, and are sure to win praise. Here, we present a model of a domestic cushion for our enthusiasts to use as a reference.

### Reunion Moon

— Lü Baihua

A kind of reunion moon, shines on sorrow and shines on joy.

When I received Ying Zikai's
cover painting for the "Free Talk Monthly,"
with these two lines of poetry,
I felt boundless
bewilderment. It's Mid-Autumn Festival again,
the most evocative Mid-Autumn Festival
of the year, especially this
year, this evening, the division
between the levels of sorrow and joy
is even more
profoundly evident.

So, I'm a little tired
of the moon. It is said that the Mid-Autumn Festival moon
is the roundest and brightest. Sun
Fu's poem: "All twelve full moons are
beautiful to see, but the fullest of all is in
Mid-Autumn." Xu Tang's poem: "The power of the moon is
shown every month, but the brightest shine is in
Mid-Autumn." Precisely because under the light of the roundest
and brightest moon, I, who belong
to the sorrowful realm, am
particularly stirred by, or rather,
dissatisfied with reality. Although
the call for thrift resounds through the clouds,
the mooncakes consumed by those seeking pleasure
still rob the poor of a month's
worth of grain, even more so now.
What can be said!

So, I can only simply
fear facing the moon, resent the moon.
Why is it particularly
bright and round during Mid-Autumn? Of course,
the season creates this. The autumn
season is inherently clear, and the autumn colors
are evenly divided tonight, naturally showing the
brightness and roundness of the moon. In the past, Dong
Po heard someone say: "Although Mid-Autumn is tens of thousands
of miles away, one day they will meet and face each other, with the same
weather, whether sunny or cloudy."
It would be strange for the weather to be the same
across tens of thousands of miles. This does not need to be explored. It just
reminds me of Dongpo's "Water Melody," which
is indeed a portrayal of the impoverished class.
The lines "Turns to the vermilion pavilion, lowers to the embroidered door,
shines on the sleepless. There should be no resentment,
why is it rounder at the time of separation."
However, Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty
ordered the singing of this newly popular tune.
"Afraid that the jade towers and mansions,
are unbearable in the high places."
He was so moved that he pardoned his
punishment. Now, how many
people are singing, and how many
are sleepless and resentful? However,
who is moved?

So, the reunion
moon of Mid-Autumn, only when I was a child snuggled
in my mother's arms, pointing
at it with love, I still fear
facing it. I understand that this
relationship is not about the moon, just as Li Lie
wen said in the article he sent me about
Shanghai, "Here I have my
love, and also my hatred and
pain," just as I suspect
that the reunion moon seems to shine particularly on
our poverty and sorrow.

### From Autumn to Mid-Autumn

— Wei Zhi

In terms of seasons, I love autumn even more.
Autumn grass in the wind, autumn dew glistening, standing in the morning
by the Yangtze River, looking around blankly, gazing into the distance at the autumn water
the same color as the western sky, I can't help but feel that "wealth to
me is like autumn wind passing through my ears." Emperor Wen of Wei's
poem: "The long autumn night is vast, the fierce north wind is
cold," what a clear and cold realm.

Summer nights are short and unbearable. Autumn nights are getting longer, and mosquitoes are getting fewer.
Place a chair and sit in the garden, looking up at the autumn stars
, which is also quite pleasant. Spring makes people lazy
, summer is full of sweat, and winter can only
close the windows, shut the doors, and lie under the covers. Among the four seasons
, only autumn gives people a sense of clarity and freedom
. George Bernard Shaw said: "People must get used to autumn
." Only by getting used to it can one appreciate the true
beauty of autumn. Among the 19th-century British poets
, Byron was better able to appreciate the desolation of autumn
, while Shelley only admired the splendor of spring
. The reason for this is that Shelley was "inhuman"
, while Byron was too "human"
.

Autumn is the season of harvest, gradually
returning from splendor to simplicity, but it is often the most full
and fulfilling time. From spring to autumn, it is like
a person growing from youth to maturity. Therefore, autumn's
other meaning is "maturity," and beyond this there is a feeling of
twilight. Autumn gentlemen and autumn women, although
they symbolize humanity from splendor to withering, if
they realize that this is inevitable, they can be more
open and free. Huainanzi says: "Spring women think
, autumn gentlemen grieve, and know the transformation of things." This also aligns
with Zhuangzi's views in "Wandering Freely" and "The Equality of Things."

Among the entire three months of autumn, the most
lovable is naturally Mid-Autumn. This is the time when "the weather is cool but not yet cold," most suitable for getting close to nature
. Both the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Double Ninth Festival are good days for enjoyment. Naturally,
in the beginning, the Mid-Autumn Festival had a history of blood and tears
, but as time passed, this day
became a folk festival for "collective enjoyment"
. Today, many villages still have collective activities of small gatherings every three days
and large gatherings every five days, in order to exchange what they have and what they lack, and the so-called "festival"
is just a publicly designated day for collective enjoyment
.

The best flower representing Mid-Autumn is the Osmanthus
, after which comes the Chrysanthemum. Li Shen's poem says: "Chrysanthemums
welcome the autumn festival with urgent west wind," this so-called "autumn festival
" is not the Mid-Autumn Festival, but the Double Ninth Festival.
Just as the Double Ninth Festival has chestnut cakes,
the wonderful product of Mid-Autumn is mooncakes. It is said that this year in Shanghai
the price of a large mooncake is easily over ten thousand
yuan. This, in the eyes of public
employees "all in the west wind," is nothing short of
irony. - The salary adjustment for public
employees in August only added one hundred thousand yuan, which is truly
grateful, a meager large mooncake. The creator of the mooncake was Liu Bowen (Ji
), which is said to contain a history of blood and tears of the Han people under foreign
invasion. "Holding
a steel knife ninety-nine times, killing all the barbarians before stopping."
Such folk songs still seem to linger in the ears.
But to this day, the moon still
shines crookedly on the earth. In the hearts of the big-bellied people or dignitaries who eat big mooncakes, is there
still that bloody memory from more than five hundred years ago
?

Two years since victory, our lives are still far
from the days of "national rejoicing"
. Looking at the current situation in China, and looking ahead
to Japan, which is putting on the facade of "democracy" and burying itself in rapid
advance, we will be even more ashamed.
If those who eat mooncakes think of the history of blood and tears
contained in the mooncakes, can they also feel something?

Autumn is the season of maturity, but China
, when will your fruits of democracy, the fruits of nation-building,
mature?!

### Man and Moon Reunion

— Hu Lu

Although it is said that the moon is better in the West, how
can it compare to my Mid-Autumn Festival? Furthermore, burn incense and prepare offerings,
and eat mooncakes, Eastern Divine Land!

Even more miracles, the city celebrates with wine and meat,
while the wilderness is full of skulls! On this joyous reunion festival,
we should be happy and not ask about sorrow!

### Osmanthus Palace Autumn

— (Two Verses)

Thinking of the past, resenting the good night, Chang
E's feelings are like the autumn tide, hard to forget Houyi's
bow that bent the moon, deeply afraid that foreign arrows will shoot the sky!

Mourning the end of the kalpa, the chaos of the clan and country, strikes
stop the axe of Wu Gang: the golden wind madly rolls
the laughter of madmen, the jade dew drips for the hungry ghosts!

### This Year's Mid-Autumn Festival

— Si Guo

The Mid-Autumn Festival, in small but famous cities like my hometown in Jiangnan,
is a day of excitement for people. Our city has glass-made
"imperial carriages," including all kinds of lamps
, small flags, and small umbrellas. On Mid-Autumn night, all kinds
of lamps are lit, plus fresh pomegranates, water chestnuts,
and mooncakes. The whole family gathers together to pay respect to the Moon Palace,
which is really fun. Parents pay respect to the big Moon
Palace, and children pay respect to the small Moon Palace, everyone rushing
and bustling, very lively.

This was my childhood. At that time, the world
had not fully recognized the continuity and
latent nature of war, and the power of killing and destruction had not
developed to the extent it has now. People, especially
in smaller cities, although constantly trampled
by civil wars, still appreciated the joy of festivals
. Perhaps life had already begun to slightly threaten
my father, but it was not very hideous and terrifying for us children
. We must celebrate the festival like a festival, my mother said
.

The scene at that time, when recalled now
, is both sweet and beautiful: the lamps were so warm
and bright, the light shining from the glass shade in various colors
, twinkling and beautiful and interesting; the mooncakes were so fragrant
and sweet, it seems that people have never been able to make that kind of cake since then
; besides taking out the "imperial carriage" for us to play
with, our parents would also buy many clay figurines and new shoes
for us. Everything was joyous and
wonderful. But now that scene seems to be a historical
relic. When I recall it, there is an unspeakable
melancholy in my heart, a light but deeply sharp melancholy. This is not
just because the beautiful childhood has passed away, because childhood
cannot last forever, but because the peaceful atmosphere of childhood
is no longer there.

Since leaving my hometown, it seems that each year is
worse than the last. The "imperial carriage" has long disappeared
; my parents no longer buy gifts for us on Mid-Autumn Festival
; mooncakes seem to become sweeter and more greasy,
and the so-called lotus seed paste is just sweet potatoes. I started working outside at the age of
seventeen, beginning a bitter life journey
. After the Anti-Japanese War, I suffered in other provinces
. My parents passed away one after another because they were not used to wandering life
. Every year during the Mid-Autumn Festival, I just go through the motions
, and only a sense of indifferent
sadness rises in my heart towards the big, cool, round, and white moon.

What about this year? Logically speaking, returning to my
hometown to celebrate the first Mid-Autumn Festival after victory should be very happy
. But the country is still in turmoil, and I myself am being held tightly
by life, unable to even catch my breath.
I have no heart to enjoy the moon. The little beautiful
childish dreams of the Anti-Japanese War have been awakened
. The world is facing the most terrifying trap
, and one careless step will lead to a fall. Suspicion, hatred, pride, and ignorance
are growing day by day, and everyone understands that
avoiding the next war is not easy.
The worried even shout, "Let's fight it early, an early fight can preserve a part!"
In the past, if A and B had a feud, fighting would settle it whoever lost
; now several groups containing fractions of all mankind each hold a set of
irreconcilable theories, wanting to destroy, if
not to conquer the rest of mankind. The result of this struggle
is hard to imagine, because the two premises of self-defense and defending the
truth do not allow people to let go halfway
. But to this day, no wisdom has emerged to
eliminate people's doubts and strengthen
people's faith in loving others as themselves. Festivals have long been
neglected by people, except for a few extremely rich
or those who never care about the future.

Today, in many small but famous cities
in Jiangnan, the Mid-Autumn Festival still has its irresistible
charm. The sky is clear, and the moon is beautiful
. But people's hearts are heavy. I
can't help but sincerely pray for our generation and the next generation.

### Mid-Autumn Festival in America

— Shu Yuan

"The moon is extraordinarily bright at Mid-Autumn," which does not depend on region or nationality. I
have not said that the bright moon is brighter in America than in China. But the same bright moon, in
America, shines on abundant crops, towering factories, prosperous cities, and couples
shoulder to shoulder. In China, it shines on the broken battlefields, the howling of grief across the fields, the hoarded granaries, and the
homeless who sleep in the open air, that light seems more suppressed
. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I lived in Hengyang and Chengdu for the first four years. Every Mid-Autumn Festival, enemy planes would definitely
arrive to drop bombs, making it impossible to celebrate the festival. In the latter four years, I stayed in the United States, like Su Wu herding sheep, with no interest in
holding chrysanthemums and appreciating the moon. For eight or nine years, there were not many mooncakes imported
. I had hoped to return victorious and enjoy a feast
, but unexpectedly the legal tender depreciated, and mooncakes rose in price. At the same time, there was talk of thrift
, and civil servants did not give or receive gifts. I could not afford to buy them, and no one sent them to me
. "When rituals are lost, seek them among the wild," let's talk about celebrating Mid-Autumn in America:

Overseas Chinese are most interested in celebrating festivals, because they work hard all year round and want to
celebrate the festivals in a lively way. As the Autumn Festival approaches, the Chinese grocery stores
in the major ports of New York and San Francisco are piled high with Cantonese-style mooncakes and incense burners
. Mooncakes are not only bought by Chinese people.
Americans also like to eat Mooncake. Foreign ladies eat mooncakes
and spread and even fabricate many stories about Chang E in the moon
, showing how knowledgeable and up to date they are.
Chinese. Overseas Chinese take a day off on Mid-Autumn Festival, burning incense
in front of the God of Wealth. And making a big scene on the Lantern Festival.
The assembly halls such as the Anliang Hall have a God of Wealth Hall, and are equipped
with a full set of Lantern Festival instruments, gongs and drums, sounding through the sky
. After the Lantern Festival is celebrated, Pai Gow and gambling games
take off, determined to enjoy the day. Cantonese theaters usually post plays such as "Chang E Flies to the Moon,"
but young overseas Chinese prefer to walk arm in arm in the moonlight to the depths of the gardens
, spending their precious time. One year on Mid-Autumn Festival, a young overseas Chinese woman invited me to her home to celebrate the festival
. After drinking and eating my fill, I felt that the moon was especially bright late at night.
Now the situation is very different. Eating Guan Sheng's bread and drinking Chang Tu's wine,
is Mid-Autumn Festival betraying me, or am I betraying Mid-Autumn Festival?

### Mid-Autumn Moon

— Xiao Kangshi

This year's Mid-Autumn Moon,
Shows more of separation and chaos!
Because we talk about thrift,
Chang E in the moon does not dance?

The moon is extraordinarily bright at Mid-Autumn, how
many families are separated and chaotic, how many are happy? Today we are talking about thrift
, even affecting Chang E in the moon, who no longer dances!

Note: "Shi Zhou Ji" says that there is
Chang E in the moon, dancing under the osmanthus tree.

### Mid-Autumn and Osmanthus

— Yue Feng

"Enjoyable Things" (written by Zhang Yuezai of the Song Dynasty) says, "In August, go to the mountains to find osmanthus, many wonderful
Mountain Osmanthus, Qi Geng Ting Qianye Osmanthus, the painting of Immortals
Building, viewing the Moon and the Osmanthus, climbing the Osmanthus," which shows that
viewing the moon and appreciating the osmanthus are inseparable elegant pastimes
. The connection between the osmanthus and the moon was established long before the Tang Dynasty,
such as when Emperor Chen Hou created the Osmanthus Palace for Zhang Lihua behind the Guangzhao Palace
, making a round door like the moon. In the Tang Dynasty, however, the osmanthus was transplanted to the moon
. Wang Wei's poem, "The osmanthus spirit is first born, and the autumn dew is slight," indicates that at that time
some people had already seen the osmanthus tree in the moon.

Although Wu Gang, who cuts the osmanthus tree, was a Han Chinese, this story
was first seen in the Tang Dynasty's "Miscellaneous Records of Youyang"
, which shows that it was still a creation that harmed people. When Xie Shen wrote his strategies, he called himself a branch of the osmanthus forest
, so the osmanthus tree was intertwined with the autumn examination, simply calling passing the examination
"picking osmanthus."

In modern times, in Yunnan in August, there is an
Osmanthus Flower Market. In Xindu, Sichuan, there is Osmanthus Lake, and the lakeside
has clusters of osmanthus trees, as many as two hundred or more, stretching for a mile
, all hundreds of years old. Around Mid-Autumn Festival, the fragrance
reaches several miles away, and travelers fill the road. In the past, the Wu custom of watching osmanthus
involved the entire city turning out, like a dragon boat race.
The osmanthus flowers of Baozang Temple in Beijing are also very famous
. From this, we can know that the osmanthus tree is commonly planted throughout the north and south of China
. On a bright moonlit night, the swaying shadow of the osmanthus, with strands of sweet fragrance
, talking about family ethics, and spending the festival, is indeed a supreme
pleasure.

When I was a child, I asked my teacher why the
moon revolves around the earth, but we always only see
Wu Gang cutting down the tree (this is the view of the Jiahu area), and not see
the other sides of the moon.
That teacher was truly knowledgeable. He said that when the moon
revolves around the earth, it is also rotating itself at the same time
, just like the earth revolving around the sun. The only
difference is that the moon's rotation time is exactly
one lunar month, which is equal to the time it takes to revolve around the earth
once. Therefore, although it keeps
revolving around the earth, it always only lets us
see the side with Wu Gang and the osmanthus tree.
As for what happened after Wu Gang cut down the tree, whether Wu Gang had
a wife and children, etc., it would not let us
see. I say that teacher was knowledgeable
, because he was an elementary school teacher thirty years ago
. I later talked about this question with many geography teachers and friends
, and they all said they had not paid attention to it.

### The Story of Mid-Autumn

— Han Xiao

Time seems to pass especially fast, and in the
blink of an eye, it's Mid-Autumn Festival again.

Speaking of Mid-Autumn, one can't help but think
of the Mid-Autumn moon. In China, there are many bizarre
legends about the Mid-Autumn moon. Let the author
write two paragraphs below as gifts to commemorate the Mid-Autumn Festival
.

Chang E Flies to the Moon According to legend, more than four thousand years
ago, in the Xia Dynasty, Houyi assisted Emperor Xiang in governing the country
, and begged the Queen Mother of the West for the elixir of immortality. His wife Chang
E (also called Heng E) stole it and fled to the moon. In this way, she would
live forever and dwell permanently on
the moon. The people have adapted her into a play, which
must be performed on stage every festival.

The Old Man Under the Moon Some people believe that there is
a jade rabbit in the moon. In Buddhism, it is also believed that
that rabbit was a devout Buddhist who voluntarily sacrificed
his lifelong happiness for the sake of the Bodhisattva. Heaven, in order to reward
its loyalty, made it
reborn, and thus became the Old Man Under the Moon. This old man
shoulders all the missions of the moon god, especially
promoting the marriage of lovers. So to this day,
there are still many superstitious and loving women who
cut white paper into the shape of rabbits on Mid-Autumn Day
and place them inside their daughters' shoes. They believe that
their daughters will soon be able to choose
a satisfactory husband and thus marry and live to old age together
.

### When the Moon is Full

— Wei Zhuang

Zhu Renkong Pingzhong's moon-viewing poem says: "The round ice mirror emits pure splendor
, is tonight like last night? I only fear that the moonlight has no likes or dislikes, but pity that people's hearts
have fullness and emptiness."

We always feel that the moon of Mid-Autumn is particularly full
and exceptionally bright, so moon-viewing must be on Mid-Autumn night.

In fact, on the fourteenth, although there is still a line of incompleteness
, as far as our naked eyes can see, we already feel that it is very full
. And on the sixteenth, in fact, Mid-Autumn has long passed
, but when you look up at the bright moon, who can distinguish where it is incomplete
? After the sixteenth, it should be discussed separately.

We always have endless hope for the future
, believing that everything can be as ideal as possible; we also
tend to have feelings of nostalgia and sentimentality for everything in the past
. Until things have passed and circumstances have changed, as if the moon has already waned
, looking back at the scene of the waxing crescent, reminiscing
about the past, it instead increases many beautiful memories
!

The so-called "moonlight has no likes or dislikes, and people's hearts have fullness and emptiness." Everything in the universe is not
absolute. If we can think one step back, we will naturally have endless joy
, while deliberately seeking perfection and being endlessly greedy
often only results in grasping an empty black shadow.

Lao Tzu said: "Holding to fullness is not as good as stopping; sharpening to sharpness cannot be long preserved. Gold and jade fill the hall, but none can keep them; wealth and nobility with pride invite their own blame. To retire when the task is accomplished is the Way of Heaven."

In all things under heaven, when things reach an extreme, they will be reversed; when prosperity reaches its peak, it will decline, and when adversity reaches its end, prosperity will come. But if you can often see a crescent moon, you can have endless hope. By the twelfth or thirteenth day, you will gradually have the intention of splendor. As for after the sixteenth, the day is eclipsed, and how can you hide it?

Maintaining fullness and preserving stability is an old saying, but retreating bravely in the face of a raging current is still considered a wise move. Do moon-viewers have this intention?

### Autumn Night Moon

— Sun Yuehan

Mid-Autumn Festival. Clear and long sky,
congealed dewdrops, constrained liver yang. Calculating material prices,
trivial matters of rice and salt. How
many things, occasionally recalling, old sorrows are difficult to stop
. Passive; the heart's screen will not be lifted tonight.

Friends and relatives are far away, working as expatriates,
like prodigal sons, all extravagance is buttoned up. Past
romantic dreams, melting ice and snow, leaving
mountains and rivers (or hometown), all broken
. Desolate and sad. Afraid to look at the exquisite
round moon late at night.

### Old Customs of the Mid-Autumn Festival

— Xiang Ruo

Mid-Autumn, commonly known as the Eighth Month Half, on this evening, families each have

banquets to celebrate the festival. People also use the weather of this night to predict

the weather of the next Lantern Festival, saying, "If clouds cover the moon on the fifteenth of the eighth month,

next year's Lantern Festival will be rained on." It is also said: "Rain beats the Lantern Festival lights, clouds

cover the Mid-Autumn moon." Cai Yun's poem says: "Heart heavy, Mid-Autumn clouds cover the moon,

at dawn, Lantern Festival clothes are drenched by rain, who knows when the bean flowers bloom,

nurturing rice is just right with water overflowing." Thus, the interests of farmers and the leisurely

are indeed quite different. Zhou Gong's collection has the line, "I only wish not to see the moon during Mid-Autumn,

to get rain beating the Lantern Festival lights," truly the words of a benevolent man. However, for elegant scholars who enjoy watching the moon and appreciating lanterns, wouldn't they consider this

"too much of a buzzkill?"

On the evening of Mid-Autumn, every household has flower arrangements and fragrant candles, worshipping towards the sky:

Children kowtow under the moon, playing in front of the lanterns, called worshiping the moon palace. Lu Qi's Beijing Annual Customs records: "On the evening of Mid-Autumn,

families each set up an image of the moon palace talisman, with a rabbit standing like a human on the talisman.

Fruits and melons are placed in the courtyard, and the cake surface is painted with a toad and rabbit in the moon. Men and women respectfully worship and burn incense,

and then burn it." Now, it is not customary to set up images of moon palace talismans, only to worship towards the sky.

In Wu customs, there is also the burning of incense buckets. Incense shops make buckets with incense sticks,

and fill them with incense powder. Monks and laypeople alike buy them, burning them under the moon.

You Songzhen's poem on incense buckets says: "Picking up incense threads, evenly and finely,

making them into the same shape as a bucket, only suitable for spiritual sandalwood mixed with wood shavings,

how could fine wine be stored in the jade palace, beautiful women lower the curtains and bend their waists frequently,

scholars read the stars and leave the handle empty, Wu customs pass on elegant stories during Mid-Autumn,

the fragrant osmanthus fills the courtyard, right in the wind."

Another poem says: "Ashamed I have no beautiful verses to collect mountain fragrance, talent and thought are difficult to measure this thing,

candle flames rush up, spearing through the moon, the sandalwood core sinks, like a gallbladder in a bag,

the smoke still forms delicate examination essays, the ashes still leave a square seal pattern, if a group of

true immortals descends to the mortal realm late at night, they would not mind singing rainbow skirts in a small room." In Hangzhou customs, they

paste paper to make a bucket, burning incense inside. The tall ones can be about two feet high. Wu Manyun's poem says: "The heart character burns to the end, inch by inch ashes, spiritual incense asks the moon wheel to open:

what the bucket measures is ultimately little in the human world, freshly harvested osmanthus grains are ten thousand bushels."

Women dress up and go out to play, visiting each other, or following along to temples as they please.

The rooster crows, yet they still dance under the moon, called walking the moonlight.

Cai Yun's poem says: "Osmanthus flower balls press down on silk fragrance, in twos and threes, sisters walk,

walking in the cold, not minding the thin silk sleeves, on the road they hate that their skirts are too long."

Villagers in the wilderness stack tiles to form a seven-story pagoda, with

an image of Ksitigarbha in the middle, lit with lamps all around, called pagoda lamps. This is meant to

illuminate the underworld, not just for sightseeing. Mei Shuangyai's poem says:

"No need to reduce the rammed earth layers, one pillar supporting the sky, seven levels of lights, the bronze sparrow terrace ashes leave pieces,

the spiritual light palace gravel accumulates layers, the candle dragon scales rush up to the sky palace, the toad pearls rise from the ground,

gentlemen and ladies pour out of the city, standing and watching, the rice star and bright moon increase the scenery even more."

Families give mooncakes as Mid-Autumn Festival gifts. On the fifteenth night,

they arrange fruits and melons to offer before the moon-worshiping feast. Qi Qi's poem says:

"Mid-Autumn Festival gifts are not cheap, fire stoves are busy, fresh from the pot,

the same cake makers have newly made, good names are first written toward the moon." The West Lake Travelogue records: "During Mid-Autumn, the common people give each other mooncakes,

taking the meaning of reunion." Wu Manyun's Jiangxiang Festival Objects poem preface:

"Hangzhou customs eat mooncakes during Mid-Autumn, setting up a moon-worshiping feast at night, taking the meaning of human and moon becoming

round." The poem says: "Powdered cream, round shadow, the moon divides its light, not

red silk, yet one eats to be full, only fearing that the reunion is empty talk on the cake, how many soldiers

have not yet returned home." This poem, even if moved to today, is very relevant.

Mooncakes come in many styles, with the more expensive ones selling for millions, with painted

figures and a hundred scenes on the surface, decorated gorgeously, the common people look at them like the moon palace,

unable to immediately obtain them. After the victory, atomic mooncakes were prevalent on the market,

I wonder if there will be flying saucer mooncakes appearing this autumn.

### Feelings on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the Thirty-Sixth Year

— Bao Zaizi

The occupied area is still not recovered, already two weeks. The local

evolution, the atmosphere is bleak. Rain and dew, thunder, and advancement are out of sync,

bandits and the smoke of war arise everywhere. People's hearts are unpredictable, families

drift and scatter. Restraining oneself and waiting, eyes looking for the dawn to break.

Scratching my head and asking the sky, my heart is alarmed by the red flames flying.

Looking around the realm, snakes and dragons compete, chickens and dogs are not peaceful.

I only see crows everywhere, cawing randomly into the wind.
