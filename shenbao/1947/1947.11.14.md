### United States Authorities Reach Consensus: Aid to China Program Under Study; Detailed Plan to be Submitted to Congress

[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 13th - Radio: Washington News - Congressman Lant requests the State Department to release the widely differing Wedemeyer Report. Mr. Lant believes that the report must advocate for immediate and substantial aid to the Chinese government, stating, "Despite its shortcomings, Chairman Chiang and his government remain the only bulwark against communism in the East."

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference on the 12th that the United States still hopes for the expansion of the National Government of China's foundation. He mentioned that no decision has been made yet on whether the United States will present any new proposals to the Chinese government regarding this matter. The State Department hopes to have precise recommendations regarding aid to China ready for submission to Congress when it convenes in regular session in January of next year, believing that Congressional action after that time would not take too long. A reporter asked Marshall whether any "political recommendations" would be attached to the aid package for China. The Secretary replied that he could not answer that question at this time. He also declined to comment on the Chinese government's suppression of the Democratic League. Marshall told those asking questions that regarding the China issue, they should pay attention to two factors: the Chinese people and the Communist Party. He stated that in some areas, these two have close relations, while in others, they do not. One reporter mentioned that there was an incident last year regarding the transportation of relief supplies to China and asked if such an incident might occur again. Marshall replied that future relief supplies would not cause such a situation because the situation at the port of Shanghai has greatly improved in the past few months. He stated that a large number of supplies are being transported into China via Shanghai and that he has not received any reports of congestion in the warehouses. He stated that he had not read a news report from Singapore claiming that Wedemeyer had suggested dividing China into three parts, and he declined to comment on this news. Marshall explained why the $300 million aid to China figure he mentioned has not been finalized, stating that because Senator Vandenberg had raised the issue of aid to China, he roughly offered this estimate. He stated that the U.S. administration is now trying to determine the best way to aid China, and the procedure is under study. He also explained that the plan under consideration is one that would help China alleviate the pressure of inflation. Marshall revealed that he had, in August 1946, January and February of this year, and shortly before his trip to the capital of Brazil in August of this year, sought funds for China from the Export-Import Bank. A reporter asked if the bank was not very sympathetic to the loan requests. He replied that he did not mean that, pointing out that the bank's charter has strict regulations regarding the certainty of repayment for loans or credit. Marshall stated that in the past, the plans submitted to the bank by China had some military value related to the Chinese civil war. He pointed out that these plans were for the rehabilitation of the Pinghan Railway, the restoration of Shanghai's public utilities, the rehabilitation of China's coal industry, and the reconstruction of several ports. He continued, stating that the projects in the proposal would be important for China's economic development. He declined to comment on whether the proposed aid to China would be allocated to the National Government and Communist-controlled areas according to the provisions of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. (Debate of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, published on the lower left corner of page 2)

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Republican Congressman Judd stated: "If the U.S. aid to China plan cannot be implemented before April of next year, I am afraid it will be too late. I deeply hope that Marshall's plan will be the beginning of genuine aid to China, but everything is still uncertain. For the past two or three years, Congress has consistently supported aid to China, but the State Department has failed to cooperate. The basic need now is to assist China in its civil war to defeat the Communist Party and prevent inflation. Once the Chinese civil war ends, its budget can be balanced within a year. It is difficult to predict how Congress will vote on Marshall's proposal, but this proposal at least shows that the State Department has recognized this need, and I hope that a practical course of action can be decided soon."

### Government Has Not Yet Learned of Marshall's Proposed Aid to China: Dong Xianguang Declares at Reception

[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 13th] Regarding Secretary of State Marshall's statement to the joint meeting of the U.S. Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee that the State Department will propose an aid to China plan to Congress, providing $318 million in aid to China within this fiscal year, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Office Dong Xianguang replied to reporters at a press conference: "The Chinese government has not yet learned the details of Marshall's statement, so I have no comment to make." According to reporters, Marshall had to make a public and concrete guarantee to the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee regarding U.S. aid to China due to pressure from Foreign Minister Wang, but this guarantee is in fact very vague and cannot satisfy either the Chinese government or the American people. The crux of the matter at present is the timeliness of the aid, not the numbers allowed on paper or orally. China's situation requires extremely urgent assistance, and Marshall's guarantee is like trying to quench a fire too late. Therefore, Marshall's statement is not as well-received as those of Roosevelt and Truman in the past. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing has resolutely refused to disclose whether the Chinese government welcomes it, and Director Dong ultimately declared a evasive silence. At the same time, the debate between some pro-aid individuals in the United States and Marshall will become increasingly fierce. Marshall is now facing a test, and whether the U.S. foreign policy under his leadership is fair and makes the American people feel safe and satisfied depends on future actions.

### Opinions of Chinese and Foreign Business Communities in This City on U.S. Aid to China

[United Press, This City Dispatch] Business and financial figures in Shanghai stated that the $300 million+ aid to China after the end of the Marshall Plan could save China from bankruptcy, but it is not enough to revive China's post-war transportation and industry. The total amount of aid could offset its foreign exchange losses, which are approximately $190 million in this fiscal year, and could allow the Nanjing government to import necessary food, cotton, fertilizer, kerosene, gasoline, and machine oil. The government should be pleased with this temporary assistance, but they must be extremely disappointed that a larger sum is not allocated for the development of major projects, such as transportation, electricity, fertilizer plants, and various light industries.

Foreign business leaders here speculate that Marshall's unwillingness to include China in the recovery program, as was done with Europe, stems from his recognition that the civil war shows no sign of immediate end, making long-term recovery plans futile. If peace is ever achieved, Washington can be expected to aid China's recovery, but for now, it seems that at most, they will only aid the Nanjing government to prevent it from collapsing. The most hopeful aspects of aid to China at present are the supply of sufficient food and the implementation of food distribution in coastal cities. Another hope is that the government's foreign exchange reserves can be maintained and that military needs do not have to be reduced.

### China's Attitude on the Japanese Peace Conference Issue Remains Unchanged; The United States Continues to Exchange Views with China and the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated: China will not change its attitude toward the Japanese peace conference because the Soviet Union opposes China being a convener of the German peace conference. The Chinese government maintains the position stated by Foreign Minister Wang several weeks ago, that the Japanese peace treaty should first be discussed by the Four Powers. The Soviet Union's attitude toward China at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference does not affect China's attitude toward the Japanese peace conference. According to reports from London, diplomatic observers there predicted that China might change its attitude toward the Japanese peace conference after the Soviet Union opposed China as the convener of the German peace conference. The Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement is intended to respond to this report.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference that there has been no progress in the past month regarding the convening of the Japanese peace conference. The United States is still exchanging views with the governments of China and the Soviet Union on a cooperative process related to the Japanese peace treaty.

### U.S. Economic Aid to China Will Help Stabilize Prices: Vice Minister of Finance Xu Botu Reports at National Economic Council

### Regular Meeting of the National Economic Council

[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 13th] The National Economic Council held a regular meeting at 3 PM on the 13th, primarily discussing the recommendations of the three committee members who went to Shanghai to investigate prices. Apart from guiding speculative capital into the right track, it was decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance to handle as appropriate. The committee members all believed that tightening credit, properly using funds, and controlling the financial market were the most appropriate steps, and they deeply hoped that the financial authorities would strictly implement them. Regarding the tax system improvement, it was handed over to the Financial Group Committee members Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Huang Yuanbin, Xiao Zheng, Shi Kuiling, and other seven people for further study. The committee members expressed many opinions on financial and economic policies, but no decision was made. Guiding Chinese nationals to use overseas deposits to purchase machinery and equipment was handed over to the Export Control Commission for preliminary study before making a decision. The meeting also discussed the joint distribution of cotton yarn and the joint purchase of cotton, but because it was of great importance and difficult to implement, it was decided to deliberate at length before conducting further research. Secondly, the industrial, commercial, and transportation sections of the economic reform plan have already been drafted and completed by the Secretariat. When submitted to the meeting for discussion, the committee members unanimously advocated that the committee members should first review it before convening a special conference for careful discussion. The Secretariat made the following reports at the meeting on the 13th: The National Economic Council has already formulated opinions on the Ministry of Economic Affairs' proposed standards for re-evaluating the value of the ministry's investment projects, and the Executive Yuan will follow suit. The Sino-U.S. Agricultural Technology Cooperation Program has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The 37th year Grain Production Increase Plan has also been approved by the Executive Yuan.

Editorial

### A Review of the American Aid to China Plan

The United States Congress is scheduled to hold a special session on the 17th of this month to discuss the pressing issues of aid to Europe and aid to China. The Foreign Affairs Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives first met on the 11th to hear Secretary of State Marshall's appeal to quickly aid countries that have suffered war damage. Regarding the Chinese portion, Secretary of State Marshall stated that the State Department eagerly anticipates aiding China and intends to request Congress to allocate 300 million US dollars for aid to China, adding: "Inflation is a difficult problem for China and must be helped to improve; and the Chinese government should also take steps to prevent inflation so that our aid to China can achieve at least seventy percent effectiveness." After hearing Secretary of State Marshall's remarks, we feel that the issue of American aid to China still requires further review by both sides.

Recently, in American public opinion, whether in opinions published in newspapers and magazines or in opinions expressed by the general American public, there has been a clear change in attitude towards China. Especially since Mr. Pulitzer's "Impressions of a Visit to China" was published in Life magazine, it has attracted widespread attention from the national government and the public. Reviewing the discussions published by Americans in the past month, we can see that the United States is unanimously sympathetic to China's appeal, moving from "concern" to "anxiety." Everyone advocates for immediate and comprehensive aid to China, and that aid plans to China and Europe should be submitted to Congress for discussion simultaneously, so that the United States can adopt a policy of balanced stability in both Europe and Asia. Ambassador Stuart, General Wedemeyer, and Congressmen Vandenberg, Martin, and Judd, can all see the big picture and make this argument. However, in today's United States, there is still a small group of people who advocate "Europe first, the Far East second," and that the United States should only aid Europe to counter Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe; and then aid China. Their specific reasons are based on narrow views, but they can cater to the inertia of some who lack a sufficient understanding of the issue. In the cracks of these various opinions, where will the American diplomatic authorities ultimately go? It still depends on Secretary Marshall's choice? But after reading Marshal's remarks released the day before yesterday, he said: "The situation in China is different from the situation in Europe. Europe needs urgent aid to prevent the import of important goods from coming to a standstill, otherwise famine and industrial bankruptcy will occur; but the Chinese problem is different, China's imports are not facing an immediate threat of coming to a standstill, and China has its own resources." Here, Marshall seems to have been somewhat influenced by the latter opinion.

Today, the issue of American aid to China may become one of the themes of the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Republican leader Vandenberg has firmly advocated that China should be included in the scope of American foreign aid. New York Governor Dewey also recently gave a speech, also accusing President Truman of abandoning China, an ally. After returning to the country from the Far East, Republican Congressman Judd has even more loudly pointed out that MacArthur's biggest trouble is the situation in China. Even Republican presidential candidate Taft also believes that aid to China is more important than aid to Europe. He said: "Before considering aid to Europe, the United States should first consider the proposal to aid China." From this, it can be seen that the Republican leader's active advocacy of aid to China has been frankly revealed to the American people. But in all fairness, President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have also established the principles for aiding China: Aid to China is equivalent to aiding the United States itself. All Americans who have been to the Far East recognize this point. Pulitzer is like this, and Judd is also like this. We believe that whether Chinese or American, everyone agrees with Pulitzer and Judd's views. In terms of the current situation in the Far East, the interests of China and the United States are completely consistent. Aid to China is equivalent to aid to the United States, which has become an indisputable conclusion. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall must also be aware of this. Marshall's reply to Republican Congressman Fulton also said: "The stability of China is extremely important to the United States and the world." This is a very good proof. However, the focus of the issue of aid to China is how to make it effective? Marshall said, "The US government hopes that this aid will be effective," which can be described as hitting the nail on the head. We believe that American aid to China is like a doctor's use of medicine. It must not only be "timely" but also the amount of medicine must be "just right." If it is past the time, the medicine will become ineffective; if the amount is insufficient, it will also be equal to zero. According to Marshall's aid to China plan, it is divided into two parts: The United States will provide 60 million US dollars in aid to China before July 1 of next year; After June 30 of next year, 20 million US dollars will be provided to China every month until July 1, 1949. The total amount is 200 million US dollars. Based on this, American aid is not only not "timely," but the amount is also obviously insufficient. If the amount is insufficient, and the aid is not timely, then even if the wish is grand, how can it be effective? Marshall still wants to use these 300 million US dollars to help China improve its monetary system. While the kindness is touching, it is not easy to say "hope to be effective."

However, if we observe from another perspective, Secretary of State Marshall, in view of the state of inflation in China, has formulated this aid to China plan and submitted it to a special meeting of Congress for discussion, so that both the Chinese government and the people can obtain real benefits. This kindness and goodwill are still worthy of our praise. At the same time, we ourselves should also take this opportunity to deeply reflect, and our government and people should strive for self-reliance first. The so-called "Heaven helps those who help themselves," we must first seek self-reliance before we can get help from friendly countries. We must never have the mentality of relying on foreign aid and not seeking self-reliance. The Chinese people should first launch a self-restraint movement psychologically to eliminate this unprogressive concept of "relying on foreign aid." Marshall's plan, observed from the two angles of "timely" and "amount," will indeed make American aid ineffective, but if we can uphold the firm belief of "self-reliance," earnestly implement our own plan, and show that American aid can be effective, then when the US Congress discusses the Marshall Plan for aid to China, Republican congressmen will surely stand up and strive to revise the Marshall Plan so that it can be timely and effective. Therefore, the focus of the American aid to China issue can be said to be the key still lies in our government and people.

### Communist Bandits Seek to Achieve a "Three Demands" Policy; The National Military and Civilians Should Raise Awareness

"Continued from Page 1" Before reporting on the war situation, Deng said: Because the Communist bandits' old nest and base have been broken, and supply from outside the border has been cut off, the bandit-occupied areas have exhausted their sources of troops and food, and after being forced to implement a hollow tactics, they have mobilized all their forces, crossed the Yellow River under the slogan of a general counter-offensive, and roamed north of the Yangtze River, in order to achieve the goals of seeking troops, seeking clothing, seeking food, destroying traffic, expanding their strength, and replenishing themselves locally. This conspiracy and trickery deserves the vigilance of the national military and civilians.

For two months, the Communist bandits have been roaming south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River, avoiding decisive battles with the main force of the National Army, rotating and milling around, and drilling through gaps to harass. Their purpose of seeking clothing, seeking food, and seeking troops has been partially achieved because the National Army has avoided dispersing its forces and has not stationed troops everywhere, and the people have no self-defense forces. As a result, the loss of life and property of the people has been extremely great, clothing has been plundered, food has been distributed, and forced conscription has been countless. The Communist bandits have gained a temporary respite and have recently launched a propaganda offensive, saying that they will roam across the southern bank of the Yangtze River.

The Yangtze River is not like the Yellow River, and it is not easy for bandits to sneak across, but in view of the roaming of the Communist bandits in Lu, Su, Yu, E, and Wan, plundering the clothing and food that the people rely on for their livelihoods as much as possible, and forcibly coercing every strong young person to join the army, be a party member, and carry a civilian husband, in order to break the Communist bandits' continued expansion of roaming and the "three demands" tactics of seeking clothing, seeking food, and seeking troops, we must prevent problems before they occur, and to avoid being destroyed by life and life when bandits roam, only the national military and civilians must raise their awareness, strengthen mobilization, and eliminate the current Communist bandits, so that democracy and freedom can be truly guaranteed.

To break the bandits' three-demand tactics, only a thorough implementation of general mobilization is possible. Governments in areas where bandits roam should implement a wartime system as much as possible. Politics must effectively cooperate with the military. People must begin to live a wartime life. How to strengthen the self-defense capabilities of local people, how to concentrate food, and control materials so that bandits cannot arbitrarily coerce people to join the army, be a civilian husband, and cannot easily seek clothing, seek food, and replenish themselves locally are all urgent tasks at hand, and they must be implemented quickly and effectively with the unity of the military, government, and people in order to effectively prevent bandits from crossing the Yangtze River. If the National Army can get the combined strength of politics and the people, it can concentrate its forces and gradually eliminate the bandits north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River.

### Content of Chen Cheng's Address

"Continued from Page 1" Industrial production was originally 9 million tons, but now it is only 1.25 million tons, accounting for about 14 percent. Mineral production was originally 30 million tons, but now it is only 6 million tons, accounting for about 20 percent. Power generation was originally 1.71 million kilowatts, but now it is only 210,000 kilowatts, accounting for about 12.8 percent. The railway mileage was originally 11,100 kilometers, but now it is only 1,750 kilometers, accounting for about 15 percent. The transportation capacity was originally 6.5 million tons, but now it is only 510,000 tons, accounting for about 7.7 percent. And the numbers recently destroyed by the Communist bandits have not yet been included. Therefore, based on the general ideal development, even if we want to restore the original foundation, I am afraid that it cannot be achieved in the short term. Therefore, before the military is deployed in the Northeast, making unplanned construction will only increase the financial burden, and before the restoration of water and electricity, the lack of power will make it even more difficult to resume work. At the same time, the intermittent transportation in the rear and the large-scale exchange of production materials are not permitted by the environment. And promoting domestic and foreign investment and utilizing Japanese reparations machines cannot be done in the short term. Chen then put forward four points as a reference for determining the focus of future work. First: Eliminating the Communist bandits, recovering lost land, and unifying the country to ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty is the main part of nationalism that has not been fully implemented in the early revolution, and it is also a prerequisite for peaceful construction. The primary task of the later revolution is to quell the rebellion and fight the Communist bandits with all our strength. Although the Communist bandits' so-called sixth offensive has failed militarily, we must intensify our suppression in politics and economics, and fundamentally eliminate it. We must never allow a seventh offensive. In the process of continuing this struggle, we must pay special attention to the Communist bandits' provocations and cultural poisons, and mutual attacks. Second: In terms of politics, promote local autonomy, organize and train the people, and improve grassroots political organizations to lay the foundation for constitutional government. In addition, the following should also be noted: Provincial, city, and county governments must not leave their jurisdiction. If the situation is extremely bad, they must break up into political work teams and maintain close contact and continue to open their doors to compete. In order to change the aforementioned purpose, the provincial and municipal government organizations should become combat bodies. Third: Implement the economic principles of people's livelihood, work hard to increase production, and strive for reasonable distribution. All future measures should first ensure that the production and resources of the Northeast are not used by the enemy and set a minimum requirement. Fourth, develop culture, universalize education, and establish the ideology of the Three Principles of the People to enhance the people's confidence in the country, the nation, and the government. In the future, the Northeast can also try to implement planned education.

### Beiping-Shanghai Exchange Rate Soars

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Today, the Shanghai exchange rate in Beiping soared, reaching 90 yuan. This surge was led by Tianjin. The official exchange rate of the national bank has been adjusted to 45 yuan since the 11th, and the premium has doubled. It is generally speculated that it may be related to the suspension of forward foreign exchange sales this time. Because the suspension of forward foreign exchange sales symbolizes that foreign exchange will rise in the near future, gold, banknotes, and department stores have all surged. In addition, the war in Shijiazhuang has also had an impact.

### Fen River to Build a Reservoir; Todd Agreed in Taiyuan; Todd Left Beiping Yesterday and Flew Back to Shanghai

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration water conservancy expert Todd. Left Beiping by plane to Shanghai today. Todd's trip to the north has roughly decided on the construction of a reservoir in Lancun, Fenhe, to transform the country around Taiyuan into a fertile land. At the invitation of Yan Xishan, he flew to Taiyuan on the 9th and held a meeting with Yan and Jin's water conservancy engineering experts to study the Fenhe reservoir construction. He also went to Zhacun, 60 miles northwest of Taiyuan, to conduct a survey.

Jin's Water Conservancy Bureau has re-formulated a detailed plan based on Todd's suggestions, and after Todd's verification, it can be started. It is estimated that the total project cost will be 2 million US dollars, and half of it will be asked for American assistance. Todd will serve as the chief engineer. After the reservoir is completed, the downstream of Fenhe will become fertile land. The life of the reservoir can reach 40 to 50 years, and the project cost will be recovered year by year.

### Heated Debate in U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee on Aid to China Issue, Wedemeyer Report May Be Partially Released

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall said on the 12th that the entire Wedemeyer Report may never be released because "I believe releasing the report would be detrimental to either the Chinese government or the U.S. government." Marshall, appearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, warned the committee that the current emergency aid, estimated at $597 million, may need to be increased if Congress delays action on the aid-to-Europe issue for too long. However, Marshall said that some parts of the Wedemeyer Report may eventually be made public. He said that the State Department is currently working on this matter. Marshall made this statement after being questioned repeatedly by Republican Congressman Fulton, who said that he wanted to know when the Wedemeyer Report would be released. Marshall said that "the stability of China is undoubtedly extremely important for the United States and the world." However, he continued, "The aid issue is an extremely complex problem. To make American aid effective, there are many things that China should do." Marshall said that he also disagreed with some of Wedemeyer's conclusions, but solemnly stated that this was not his reason for prohibiting the release of the Wedemeyer Report. Fulton asked if the State Department wanted to request funds from Congress for aid to China without providing sufficient facts, and he believed that this policy was not a smart way to do things. Marshall replied: "Regarding such international events, not all facts can be made public. This almost makes all negotiations impossible. Many facts cannot be released except to a few highly trustworthy people." During Judd's attempt to investigate the planned aid-to-China issue, a heated debate and questioning occurred. The debate ended due to objections from New York Democratic Congressman Bloom. However, Judd explained that if the situation in the Far East continues to deteriorate, he is deeply skeptical about the success of aid to Europe. Judd had just returned last week after traveling in China and various parts of the Far East. He said that responsible people in the Chinese government wanted to know why the United States was not giving them aid in China's anti-communist war. Judd said that the Chinese people asked him the following five questions:

Is the race issue related to the attitude of the United States?

Does the United States still believe that the CCP are merely reformers and are not directed by the Kremlin?

Does the United States believe that the China issue is ultimately not important?

Does the United States think that the situation in China is not as critical as that in Europe?

Whether the Chinese government failed to fulfill its obligations to the United States during or after the war.

Marshall replied: Such questions are "unbelievable." The United States has never thought about the race issue. He said: The stability of China is very important to the United States, and the United States has never neglected this. This is no longer a question. The whole question is what kind of action the United States is actually going to take. He continued: "This is one of the most difficult and complex situations I have ever encountered, but I am not completely pessimistic and believe that we can still find a solution."

Judd said: "I feel it is important to express an attitude to the Chinese government, explaining that if they cooperate with us, we will give them aid." Marshall bluntly replied: "I don't want to criticize the Chinese government here." At this point, Bloom rose to object, saying that the discussion had deviated far from the topic of this committee's discussion of aid to Europe.

Prior to this, Marshall told the committee that the State Department intends to have the China relief plan ready by the time Congress reconvenes next January at the latest, if not sooner. He said that the State Department has been looking for practical ways to aid China since last year, but has found that most solutions are "very impractical."

Judd asked whether Marshall's aid plan outline proposed on the 11th is appropriate when the military situation in China continues as it is now. Marshall replied: Unless China's military expenses are reduced, it is indeed difficult to find any way to benefit China. This is the most destructive fact in the situation in China. Judd asked: If North China and the Northeast are controlled by the CCP, would this be contrary to the interests and foreign policy of the United States? Marshall replied: "That's exactly what I mean." At the same time, the White House announced that President Truman will address a joint session of the House and Senate when the special Congress reviews foreign aid and price issues. Also, when Marshall appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Commerce Secretary Harriman appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Harriman served as chairman of the 19-member special committee, which requested at the end of last week that $12 billion to $17 billion be allocated to the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe and to prevent a third world war. Marshall's appearance strongly urged the passage of $597 million for emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria, and he explained that this was the minimum figure.

(United Press, Washington, 12th) Marshall told the House Foreign Affairs Committee today that the Nationalist government "must go further before we can go further." About 1,000 U.S. military officers are helping the Chinese government fight the communists, and the United States has agreed to assist China in training new troops in Taiwan. "But the China issue is far more than just the military situation. China is of great importance to the United States and the world. This view has not diminished, and the key is what can be done if China cannot do much. Nanjing must do a lot before we here can do more." Marshall also replied to Congressman Judd's question of "Is there any hope for remedy before China's huge military budget is reduced?" and said: "This is the crux of the matter." Judd asked: "Is it reasonable to use the money of the American people to aid China only to treat the symptoms and not the root cause?" Marshall said in a straightforward tone: "Mr. Judd, I really don't want to turn to criticizing the Chinese government during this committee discussion."

Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton ended this discussion by saying: "This issue is over."

### Security Council By-Election, Ukraine Elected as Member, Philippines Elected to Trusteeship Council

[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 13th broadcast: Flushing news, the United Nations held a plenary session today to elect a member of the Security Council to fill the vacancy left by Poland. As a result, Ukraine was elected with 35 votes.

[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 13th broadcast: Flushing news, the Philippines was elected as a member of the Trusteeship Council with a majority of 41 votes.

[United Press, New York, 13th] The United Nations General Assembly held its plenary session for the eleventh time since November 1st. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's two major proposals at the United Nations General Assembly, one advocating the establishment of a "Small Assembly" and the other advocating the establishment of a Korean Election Supervisory Group, are expected to receive final voting approval. The General Assembly will also elect a non-permanent member of the Security Council to succeed Poland. India and Ukraine are evenly matched in successive votes, resulting in a stalemate. India has already announced its withdrawal yesterday, so Ukraine is expected to be elected. In addition, the General Assembly must also add two members to the Trusteeship Council. The candidates are the Philippines, Norway,  Romania, and Costa Rica. The Philippines and Norway are expected to be elected.

[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] Regarding the Korean independence plan, it will soon be finalized by the General Assembly. According to this plan, a nine-nation delegation will be sent by the United Nations to supervise elections in Korea to create an independent Korean government with an army to defend its security by March 31st of next year. If possible, U.S. and Soviet troops will be withdrawn by July 1st of next year. However, Soviet resistance is expected to force the delegation to operate only in southern Korea, which will delay the establishment of an independent government in that region until around 1948.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 13th] The South Korean Provisional Government issued a statement after its 79th cabinet meeting, stating, "We firmly believe in the possibility of establishing an independent Korean government. Although a small number of groups in South Korea agree with the simultaneous withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops, we believe it is too early to say so. North Korea is now intensifying its military strength, threatening South Korea. Under these circumstances, if U.S. and Soviet troops actually withdraw, it would be tantamount to giving North Korea a good opportunity to invade South Korea."

### UN Political Committee Resolves to Strike Franco Again, Requests All Member States to Recall Envoys

[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] The UN Political Committee today passed a resolution, reaffirming the resolution of the previous General Assembly, requesting all member states to recall their envoys stationed in Spain, and declaring that when the Security Council considers the situation in Spain requires it, it shall fulfill its responsibilities in accordance with the Charter. The voting was 29 to 6, with 20 abstentions. The United States abstained, while China, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union all voted in favor. Argentina, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, and Iran voted against. The resolution will be submitted to the General Assembly for final voting.

### South Africa's Discrimination Against Indians, India Requests Roundtable Discussion

Indian representative Mrs. Pandit proposed a resolution recommending that the parties involved in the dispute hold a roundtable meeting to discuss the treatment of Indians in South Africa, and suggesting that Pakistan also participate in this meeting.

### U.S. Response to De Gaulle's Proposal is Lukewarm

[United Press, Washington, 12th] General de Gaulle proposed that France, Britain, and the United States form an alliance to counter the Soviet Union. Washington's reaction to this news today was not enthusiastic. There was no direct comment from diplomatic circles. Only an official who usually publishes State Department policies made two private statements: On the surface, forming such an alliance at present would tend to divide Europe, which the U.S. government has repeatedly opposed. Part of Marshall's plan to aid Europe is based on the possibility of restoring trade between East and West. If it is divided, it will inevitably fail.

### United States Attaches Importance to Middle East Oil Fields, Believes They are Tied to Fate of Europe, Asia, and Africa

[Reuters, New York, 12th] Henderson, Director of the State Department's Near East and Africa Division, delivered a speech to the Academy of Political Science here today, declaring that the fate of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa is tied to the Middle East oil fields not being controlled by a hostile power. For the sake of U.S. security and world peace, aggression in the Middle East will not be allowed. The Middle East's oil is the lifeblood of industry and transportation in South Asia and Africa, and it is also linked to the future destiny of Europe. If a hostile power occupies these resources, it will hinder the subsequent revival of Western Europe, delay the economic development of South Asia and Africa, and cast a shadow over the entire world for many years. The power referred to by Henderson is obviously the Soviet Union.

### U.S. Government to Announce Industrial Mobilization Plan, Revealed by Secretary of Defense Forrestal

[United Press, Washington, 13th] U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal said; several famous American scientists, led by MIT, are studying a nationwide electronic warning system. He also said that a national industrial mobilization plan will be announced early next year.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Responding to Marshal Eisenhower, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Nimitz told the President's Air Force Policy Committee on the 12th that the United States is unlikely to be drawn into war in the next two or three years. Admiral Nimitz believes that the United States is "relatively safe" from attack for the next four or five years. And as time goes by, the danger of war decreases. Eisenhower said: "In the next three or four years," war is unlikely to occur. American power will continue to increase, and the world will feel the impact of the United States.

### French Political Situation Remains Serious Under Attack from Both Left and Right Extremes, Communist Party in Marseille Incites Labor Unrest and Riots

### Harriman Calls for Aid to Europe, Emphasizes U.S. Definitely Has Ability to Provide Foreign Aid, U.S. to Require Uranium as Compensation for Loans

[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 13th broadcast: Washington news, when Chairman Vandenberg of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee discussed the issue of aid to Europe in the committee, he asked Philip, Director of the International Trade Policy Division of the State Department, whether the government was considering obtaining platinum from the Belgian Congo as a price for U.S. aid to Europe? Philip replied that senior government officials are currently considering this approach. Vandenberg asked the government to provide more information on this matter. Congressman Jonkman told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the government's efforts to provide aid to Europe are too slow, and that France, Italy, and Austria must wait until March of next spring to receive the $597 million in emergency aid proposed by Marshall.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Commerce Secretary Harriman told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the $597 million in emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria can curb the trend of decreasing U.S. exports.

The amount of U.S. exports has decreased from 13 billion yuan in the second quarter of this year to 11 billion yuan in the third quarter of this year. The amount of exports in the fourth quarter of this year will not decrease further, and with the help of new funds, it should be able to increase in the first quarter of 1948. Harriman went on to present various figures and facts to prove that the United States can fulfill the delivery obligations in the aid plan without much difficulty. He pointed out that the current coal output is only 3.5 percent of the total production, and the U.S. distribution and export certificate system can prevent excessive outflow of grain. Senator Connally raised the issue of British coal production. Harriman said that improvements in British labor and technology can enable the British coal industry to play a major role in the task of European revival.

### U.S. Plans to Re-Propose Forty-Year Treaty Against German Aggression at Foreign Ministers Conference; Discussion on Procedural Matters Still Yields No Results

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Marshall told the Congressional Political Committee on the 12th that when he attends the London Foreign Ministers Conference, he will re-propose the Four-Power Forty-Year Treaty to prevent German re-aggression. We must ensure that the people of Europe do not feel abandoned due to the sudden withdrawal of the United States from Europe. This treaty was originally proposed by former Secretary of State Byrnes and was discussed again at the Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow in April, but was rejected by the Soviet Union both times.

[United Press, London, 13th] According to authoritative sources, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States will do their utmost to support the United States' proposal for a Four-Power Forty-Year Agreement to prevent Nazi re-aggression at the Foreign Ministers Conference.

[Reuters, London, 12th] The representatives of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference discussed the agenda for the next Foreign Ministers Conference. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States suggested that the Austrian treaty be placed at the top of the agenda. The Soviet Union's counter-proposal was the opposite, and the result was still no result. The United Kingdom and France also suggested discussing economic principles before discussing the political organization of Germany. The United States' draft agenda will be submitted on the 13th, but the U.S. representative, Mr. Fei, said today that the order of the agenda items proposed by the Soviet Union should be revised. The British draft agenda stipulates the following order of discussion: 1. Report of the Austrian Treaty Committee; 2. Economic principles, post-war German industrial standards, compensation plans, including the plan to incorporate Saar into the French economic system; 3. The form and scope of Germany's interim political organization; 4. The treaty proposed by the United States for thorough disarmament of Germany under the supervision of the Four Powers; 5. Report of the Foreign Ministers' representatives on the procedures for preparing the German peace treaty; 6. Other matters. Soviet representative Mr. Smirnov stated that the Soviet Union does not neglect the Austrian treaty issue, as can be seen from the fact that the Soviet delegation has included the Austrian treaty issue in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference. However, the Soviet Union believes that the purpose of convening the Foreign Ministers Conference was primarily to discuss the German peace treaty, so it should naturally discuss the German peace treaty first.

### Review Results of Municipal Government Organization; Executive Yuan Believes Further Streamlining Still Needed; At Least One-Tenth of Section Chiefs and Employees Should Be Dismissed; News and Personnel Departments Should Be Changed to Offices

The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the Shanghai Municipal Organization Regulations originally reviewed and determined by the Executive Yuan are too strict and may hinder work efficiency, so it specifically requested a re-review. The Executive Yuan convened the Shanghai Municipal Organization Regulations Review Committee again on the 10th of this month for another review. The Municipal Government also sent Director of the Social Bureau Wu Kaixian and Chief Advisor Wang Zhaoquan to Nanjing to state the reasons why the Municipal Government's institutions and personnel cannot be reduced. According to reporters who inquired from relevant parties, the Executive Yuan's research results believe that the Municipal Government's institutions still need to be streamlined and redundant personnel should be dismissed. It is believed that the number of advisors in the Municipal Government should be limited to six, and the number of appointed secretaries should be limited to five. Other senior personnel should be dismissed, and the system, such as the News and Personnel Departments, does not need to be so large and can be reorganized into offices. In terms of various bureaus, the principle should be not to set up sections. However, if necessary, sections may still be allowed to be set up. Except for the Social Affairs and Public Works Bureaus, where two appointed secretaries can be set up due to the complexity of affairs, other bureaus are limited to one appointed secretary. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Government has more than 40,000 personnel in total (including personnel from various business inspection institutions and police officers), and there are more than 3,000 office personnel alone, which is indeed too many. In particular, the number of section chiefs, committee members, and employees is not in line with the system and should be reduced. The Executive Yuan's representative stated that the reduction rate should be at least one-tenth. The Municipal Government hopes to maintain the status quo. Currently, the Municipal Government representative Wang Zhaoquan is still in Nanjing continuing negotiations.

[Another report] During this meeting, Mr. Wang tried hard to argue that Shanghai is a commercial center with complex circumstances. Based on reality, this is necessary to promote administrative work. Although there are 40,000 civil servants in the city, this actually includes police officers, street cleaners, and staff from various business units. The Municipal Government itself and the staff of various bureaus total about 3,000 people. If we follow the central government's regulations to reduce 1,800 people, with an average salary of 2 million yuan per person per month, the total is only 3.6 billion yuan per month, which the Municipal Government can still afford. Moreover, the business tax has recently been collected by the Municipal Government, so there should be no problem with expenditures.

It is also reported that in order to enhance the work efficiency of polling station staff, the office will hold a lecture on the morning of the 15th and a voting drill on the upper floor of the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market at 3:00 p.m.

### Six Japanese War Criminals Escorted to Hankou for Trial

[This newspaper's report] Six Japanese war criminals were escorted from the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense to the Jiangshun ship at 5:00 p.m. yesterday and will set sail for Hankou tomorrow for trial.

During the War of Resistance, he massacred more than 200 Chinese people in Tianmen County, Hubei Province. After the victory, the criminal was actually repatriated to his country. After repeated negotiations with General MacArthur's headquarters by our government, he was finally escorted from Japan to Taiwan on April 21 of this year and escorted to Shanghai on the 28th. 2. Lieutenant General Ban Takeo, 56 years old, from Fukuoka, killed many Chinese civilians in China in 1932. 3.

### Broadcasting Good Shows; Please Untie Your Purses; Winter Relief Needs 60 Billion Yuan; 200,000 Refugees Urgently Awaiting Assistance from All Sectors

[This newspaper's report] The Municipal Winter Relief Committee has decided to hold a radio fundraising event at the Shanghai Radio Station on the 15th and 16th of this month to raise funds, and it will be broadcasted voluntarily by all public and private radio stations in the city. Yesterday at 3:00 p.m., the committee hosted a tea party at the Lido Garden to entertain people from the broadcasting and performing arts industries. Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiguan, Wang Xianqing, Wu Kaixian representing Yuan Wenzhang, and more than 100 people from the broadcasting and performing arts industries attended. First, Du Yuesheng gave a speech, stating: Although the Municipal Government has decided to allocate 10 billion yuan for this year's winter relief, the funds are still insufficient because the Relief General Office has ended this year and food and other materials must be raised on their own. It is estimated that a total of 60 billion yuan is needed. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate. Then, Speaker Pan gave a speech, stating: Relieving refugees is actually equivalent to relieving ourselves. There are 200,000 refugees in Shanghai. If they are allowed to suffer from hunger and cold, they will inevitably take risks, and society will not be peaceful. Therefore, even for our own safety, we should relieve refugees. Last time, to avoid social unrest and public anxiety during the conscription in the city, it was suggested that the government adopt a voluntary military system. Now, the voluntary soldiers have been recruited and have already been dispatched. However, it is painful to see that only 5 billion yuan has been raised for the 20 billion yuan needed to pay the voluntary soldiers' family allowance. This is truly an unfair society. Now, the winter relief funds are more important than the family allowance. It is hoped that the people of Shanghai will not wait until the fire is burning their eyebrows before they come to the rescue. Xu Jiguan also pointed out that saving people is saving ourselves, and donating more money is equivalent to saving more people. Wang Xianqing reported on the donation methods: 1. Increase the entertainment tax by 20%. 2. Hold a relief horse race. 3. Hold a charity soccer game. 4. Launch fundraising activities from all walks of life. Individuals and groups who donate more than 1 million yuan will be given certificates, and those who donate large amounts will be awarded plaques by the Social Bureau and the Municipal Government. Then, Yuan Wenzhang reported on the use of donations: 1. Establish shelters, two of which already exist in Caohejing and can accommodate 4,000 people. It is also planned to establish shelters in Zhabei Jiangwan to provide porridge and clothing. 2. Entrust charitable organizations to provide relief. 3. Cooperate with the Public Works Bureau to carry out work-for-relief programs.

[Another report] The committee has decided on the following broadcast schedule for the 15th and 16th: On the 15th, from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. will be Shanghai Opera, from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. will be storytelling, from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. will be slapstick comedy, and from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. will be stories.

### First Case of Us Trying a British Criminal; Trial of Queripel, Suspected of Murdering Gold and Foreign Exchange Broker, Concluded; Judgment to Be Pronounced

[This newspaper's report] Queripel, a British suspect in the murder of black market gold and foreign exchange broker Yu Shengxiao, was tried in the Criminal Division of the District Court yesterday afternoon. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month.

At 2:00 p.m., Queripel was escorted to the court by bailiffs from the Sinan Road Detention Center. Immediately, Judge Zhu Yuhuang, together with Prosecutor Ding Tongjun and Clerk Zhuang Zhide, took the stand and inquired about the situation from Queripel once again. The court then ordered the start of the verbal debate. The prosecutor stated: Our country has recovered extraterritoriality. Foreigners who commit crimes in China should be completely subject to Chinese law and be treated the same as Chinese people. At present, Chinese people who commit robbery and banditry are subject to special criminal regulations. The defendant in this case committed murder for money, which is a form of banditry. It should not be regarded as an ordinary murder case, and it should not be an exception because he is a foreigner. Moreover, this case is the first case of a British person being tried after the recovery of extraterritoriality. It should be handled with particular solemnity to set an example of equality between foreigners and Chinese people under Chinese law.

Clearly a Joint Principal Offender

Although the two mutually shirk responsibility for the murder of the victim Yu Shengxiao in this case, a review of the facts, such as how the two discussed the plan beforehand, how they borrowed hats for disguise, how they picked up Yu Shengxiao to board the car and drove to the countryside, and how they returned to Queripel's home to wash their hands and wipe off the bloodstains, leads to the conclusion that they are jointly responsible. If it was a matter of buying and selling gold bars, why would Queripel need to give a brown hat to Malai for disguise? Why did they drive the car to the countryside? Why did Malai go to Queripel's house to wash his hands and wipe off the bloodstains from his clothes when he returned? It can be seen that borrowing the hat for disguise was only for the convenience of concealing their identities, driving to the countryside was for the convenience of murder, and washing their hands and wiping off the bloodstains upon return was to eliminate traces of the murder. In short, regardless of who pulled the trigger, they are both clearly joint principal offenders.

The Situation Vividly Depicted

Malai and Yu Shengxiao did not know each other. In fact, it was Queripel who invited him to discuss the plan, drove to pick him up, asked him to disguise himself, and introduced him to Yu to sit in the car together, thereby jointly plotting the murder. If Queripel had not contacted him in the first place, Malai would not have known Yu Shengxiao and would not have committed the crime. Based on this, it can be seen that the defendant Queripel is actually the mastermind of the crime. After the prosecutor finished his argument, Queripel replied in court, "If I wanted to kill Yu Shengxiao to steal his gold bars, I could have lied to Yu to go to any location and murdered him. Why would I bring Malai along, let him witness the murder, and then testify in court? I am completely innocent." At this point, the prosecutor refuted his reply.

Defense Attorney's Argument

The defendant's lawyer then stood up to argue that the defendant was not guilty of murder, and the reasons were as follows: (A) Queripel was the driver, holding the steering wheel with both hands, how could he have held a gun to shoot Yu? (B) The murder weapon, bloody clothes, and bloody pants were all seized from Malai. (C) Based on the facts, the testimony of witnesses, and common sense, Queripel did not know in advance that Malai intended to kill Yu. He cannot be considered an accomplice and should be found not guilty by the court according to the law. By the time the statement was made, it was already past 4:00 p.m., so it was announced that the debate in this case was concluded and a date for the verdict was set.

### Movie Theaters Can Be Used as Shelters if They Close; Winter Relief Donations Will Still Be Implemented

[This newspaper's report] Director of the Social Bureau Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that when he went to Nanjing, the Chairman summoned him to inquire in detail about the labor movement and price situation in the city and instructed him to pay close attention. As for the entertainment industry's opposition to the 20% winter relief donation added to ticket prices and the widespread rumor that Western film merchants will stop supplying films starting on the 16th, Director Wu believes that relieving refugees is more important than watching foreign films, so the added donation will still be implemented starting on the 16th. If movie theaters are preparing to close, then shelters are in dire need of locations, and movie theaters can be used to accommodate refugees.

### Review of Joint Electric Power Contract Completed; Four Questions Awaiting Answers

### Zhang Chunfan Deals with Leng Shan: Lawsuit Already Lodged with the District Prosecutor's Office; Charges Enumerated in Six Points: Enticement and Restriction of Freedom

[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Chunfan, the manager of the Cathay Yue Opera Theater, was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for instigating the suicide of Xiao Dangui. He is currently detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center. Recently, his lawyer, Zhang, filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office against Leng Shan, a person involved in the case, for "enticing a woman and restricting her freedom." The lawsuit was submitted yesterday and is over a thousand words long, listing six charges against Leng Shan. The original complaint states: "Upon investigation of the sensational suicide case of Yue Opera actress Xiao Dangui (originally named Qian Chunyun, referred to as Ms. Qian below), she was the plaintiff's concubine, and they had cohabitated as a family for seven years with the purpose of permanent shared life. According to Article 1123, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code, Ms. Qian was a member of the plaintiff's family. Ms. Qian was a well-known Yue Opera performer, renowned for her beauty and substantial private wealth. When she performed at the plaintiff's Cathay Yue Opera Theater, she was a leading actress (commonly known as a 'pillar'). After the reform of Yue Opera, the old scripts no longer suited the new trends, leading to the trend of compiling and performing new plays, and the defendant in this case was hired as a writer and director. Unexpectedly, the defendant coveted Ms. Qian's beauty and wealth, and taking advantage of his position, he used various means to entice her, causing Ms. Qian to feel unable to protect herself, which led to her suicide by poisoning.

Waiting Backstage to Offer Assistance

In April of this year, the defendant, along with Wu Shen (also a director), co-directed the play 'Qin Huai Moon,' with Ms. Qian playing the lead role. The play included a scene where she jumps into the Qin Huai River to commit suicide. To achieve realism, she had to jump from a height of over three feet onto the backstage area. Each time she jumped, the defendant waited backstage, excluding others, to personally catch her. This occurred more than seventy times. It is clear that the defendant used this as an initial plan to seduce Ms. Qian.

Using a Mailbox to Exchange Love Letters

After the defendant's initial enticement plan succeeded, he devised a way to borrow Liu Qiong's (a movie actor) mailbox to exchange love letters with Ms. Qian. If, as the defendant claimed, 'everything I discussed with her was about acting,' and it was true, then it would be perfectly proper and could be openly sent. Why the need for secrecy, borrowing someone else's mailbox? And why did he claim to have lost them when questioned by the police?

Instigating Divorce Was Expected

Furthermore, the defendant stated in his confession: 'I always called Xiao around 2 PM because Xiao had agreed beforehand that Zhang Chunfan would not be home at that time, so Xiao always answered my calls.' If the defendant and Ms. Qian had no ambiguous enticement or phone calls, it would be ordinary. Why was it necessary to only call Ms. Qian when the plaintiff was not at home? After the defendant's enticement plan succeeded, he used the love letters to coerce Ms. Qian into having sex with him, which was to be expected. The next step was to instigate Ms. Qian to leave the plaintiff, which was also anticipated.

Moving the Family to Avoid Guilt

On October 7th, Ms. Qian went out at night at the defendant's invitation. According to the defendant's admission, it was because the movie showing was too early, so they rode in a car to Zhaofeng Garden. When they visited the garden, it was past closing time, so the two walked back. However, Ms. Qian returned home at 11 PM that night. Who can believe that they were walking in the street at 8 PM? After the plaintiff discovered the October 7th incident, he investigated it once, but the plaintiff and Ms. Qian reconciled afterwards. Unexpectedly, at around 3 PM on October 13th, Ms. Qian and Shen Yitao had a secret conversation in neighbor Wei Meiying's room for ten minutes. Then, at 5 PM that afternoon, Ms. Qian took poison and died in Wei Meiying's room, leaving behind the words 'It's hard to be a person, hard to be a person, I'm dead.' What was this about? Was Shen Yitao instructed by the defendant to make Ms. Qian state her position? This is highly questionable. After Ms. Qian's death, the defendant moved his family to avoid guilt, which cannot be denied. Considering the above points, it is inevitable that the defendant violated Articles 298, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law concerning the crime of restricting freedom. Therefore, in accordance with Article 213, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Procedure Law, this lawsuit is filed."

### Robbers Followed from Bank, Sock Factory Lost Tens of Millions

[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Xianzhu, an apprentice at the Xinfu Sock Factory at No. 12, Lane 57, Zijin Street, was ordered yesterday afternoon to withdraw 38 million yuan in cash from a certain bank and place it in a leather bag.

### Qimei Vessel Encountered Wind, Oil Barge Sank En Route to Tianjin

[Report from our newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Qimei vessel, carrying passengers and cargo and towing the Tanggu Engineering Bureau's B-37 empty oil barge, sailed directly to Tianjin on the 9th. On the evening of the 12th, while passing through the waters off Qingdao, it encountered severe wind and waves, and the ship's body rolled violently. For safety, some of the cargo loaded on the deck was jettisoned. At the same time, the oil barge's bow was suddenly damaged and flooded. However, due to the wind and waves, work was impossible.

### Car-jacking Bandit with Two Guns: Former U.S. Military Translator Plotted to Rob Dance Hall

### Opening the Coffin to Examine the White Bones: Corpse Scene at Huinong Bridge, Wuxi: Skull and Neck Bones Removed and Transported to Shanghai for Further Examination: "Murderous King" Wang Gaosheng Nailed and Detained

[Report from our newspaper in Wuxi, 11th] The murderous king, Wang Gaosheng, is from Tangnan Village, Jiangyin. His original name was Ren Gaosheng, nicknamed "A Gao Tou." He previously served as a company commander in the Tenth Detachment of the Loyalty and Salvation Army. Later, he betrayed the army with Chen Xiaoping and surrendered to the puppet regime, stationed in the Zhou Village area of Zhaobridge Township, relying on his position to kidnap and extort without restraint. In 1945, he murdered four villagers: Xu A Yu, Ren A Qi, Xu Wu's wife, and Ji Sun's wife. After the victory, he was spotted on the road by the family members of the victims, turned over to the police, and transferred to the District Court, which sentenced him to life imprisonment. Wang, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the High Court. During the High Court's review, it was determined that the initial judgment did not conduct a legal examination of the murdered villagers, and the conviction for murder was without legal basis. Therefore, at the end of last month, the original judgment was overturned and remanded for retrial.

On the 9th of this month, the presiding judge, Zhao Changnian, summoned the family members of the victims to court for questioning and ordered the coffins to be transported to the city for examination. On the evening of the 10th, the families of the deceased transported three coffins—those of Ji Sun's wife, Xu Wu's wife, and Xu A Yu—from the village to the riverbank of the railway bridge west of Huinong Bridge. However, the body of Ren A Qi was buried in a muddy pond and was difficult to transport to the city. At 8:00 AM on the 11th, Judge Zhao, accompanied by the forensic examiner, went to the corpse scene at the railway bridge. Because the area was small, the scene was moved to the wasteland behind Fulinsi Temple at Bridge No. 1 on the Xicheng Road for inspection. The workers were ordered to lift

three coffins

to the shore and open the coffin lids for legal examination. The crowd of onlookers was so large that it was impossible to move. All of the bodies in the coffins had become skeletons. Judge Zhao then set up a temporary public office at the corpse scene and questioned the family members of the deceased: Ji Ronggen (Ji Sun's wife's nephew) and Ji Xu's wife (the family members of Xu A Yu and Xu Wu's wife) about what happened. They stated that Ji Sun's wife was 58 years old when she was

cut in the left ear

with a sharp blade and then shot to death by Wang Gaosheng in May 1945. Xu A Yu and Xu Wu's wife were husband and wife. On July 19, 1944, they were kidnapped by Wang Gaosheng and strangled to death with ropes. Fearing his power, they hastily coffined the bodies without even changing their clothes. Xu Wu's wife was only 21 years old, beautiful, and Wang tried to take her as his wife but failed, so he killed her and her husband Xu A Yu, etc. Then the examination began. The bones of Ji Sun's wife were examined first, and it was found that there was a knife wound on the left ear skull, and the skull was shattered, confirming that she died from a knife wound. Next, Xu Wu's wife was examined and found to have a leather thread around her neck, still encircling the seven cervical vertebrae, with wounds on the fifth and fourth vertebrae, a bloodstain on the top of the skull, and rope marks on the left ankle. Both hands had

grass rope tied backward.

As a result, the skull and seven cervical vertebrae were removed. Finally, the bones of Xu A Yu were examined and found to have a grass rope around his neck, and rope marks on both hands. After a long examination, since no bone injuries were found, the skull and neck bones were removed and taken to the Shanghai Forensic Medicine Laboratory for examination before further processing. The skeletons were still collected by the families of the deceased and buried. It is said that the murderer Wang Gaosheng is still unrepentant, recruiting disciples in prison and acting as the "dragon head." Last month, he once rioted in prison and colluded with other prisoners to dig a hole in the wall in an attempt to escape. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and the criminal was nailed and detained.

After completing their matches in Hong Kong, the team arrived at Longhua Airport in this city at 2:30 PM yesterday, having departed from Hong Kong by special plane at 10:00 AM in the morning. Upon disembarking, Miss Ding Ruyu of the overseas Chinese community presented flowers to the team leader. The team leader, Guo Changfu, accepted with a smile. Except for team member Chen Jiashou, who was injured during a match in Bangkok and has returned to Singapore, the team consisted of twenty-three people.

The Football Committee had already arranged the team's schedule in Shanghai, but there were slight changes after their arrival yesterday.

Ministry of Education Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Compiling and Printing Textbooks for Primary and Secondary Schools; Preliminary Review of Scholarships for Studying in France Completed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Ministry of Education's meeting on the 13th discussed promoting three matters: improving English teaching in secondary schools; compiling and printing textbooks for primary and secondary schools; and changing the education sections of provincial, county, and city governments to education bureaus.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Ministry of Education convened a selection committee on the 13th for the exchange of ten scholarships for students studying in France, and a preliminary review has been completed.

### Students at Datong and Great China Universities Oppose Strikes

[Daguang News Agency] At 8:00 PM on the 11th, Dai Li, Chen Zanpei, and several other students from the Economics Society and History Society of Great China University, claiming to be representatives, convened a meeting of some students and proposed an immediate strike to support Yu Zisan, the Zhejiang University student who committed suicide. However, the majority of students present felt that this matter was clearly being manipulated by treacherous elements and rose up in opposition. Seeing that their plan was thwarted, Dai and others turned their anger on Wang Guozhen, a senior student in the History and Society Department, and attacked him with fists and feet. Mr. Wang has since gone missing and has not been found to this day. All the students of Great China University are extremely indignant and have established a support association, preparing to search for Mr. Wang and request that the authorities punish the perpetrators and eradicate the remaining evil elements of the conspiracy.

[Another Report] At 9:00 AM yesterday, eight or nine unidentified youths suddenly arrived at Datong University, posting slogans everywhere and contacting students in various classes to incite a strike. However, most students, mindful of the harm caused by the previous strike being exploited by bandits, were deeply vigilant and realized that the words and actions of the newcomers were the usual tricks of treacherous elements. They rose up and drove the thugs out of the school, tore down various slogans and leaflets, and continued classes as usual.

### Students of Education Department at St. John's University Raise Funds for Ai Qun Charity School

[Our Report] The "Ai Qun Charity School" founded by students of the Education Department at St. John's University has recently launched a fundraising campaign with a target of 50 million yuan, which has been endorsed by the university. Since its founding last autumn, the school has achieved remarkable results. There are currently more than 200 students, mostly shop apprentices, unemployed children, and workers from the surrounding area who cannot afford tuition, and they are all provided with free education. The 5 million yuan fund previously raised by the school has been exhausted, so it has been decided to launch another fundraising campaign to continue the development of this social education.

### Sidelines of the Municipal Games: Autumn Wind Blows, Cold Deepens; Yellow Sand Rolls, Mustaches and Eyebrows Turn Black

[Our Report] On the second day of the Games, the autumn wind suddenly turned strong, and the cold deepened in the evening. Most of the athletes were bareheaded and barefoot, shivering from the cold. The audience also retreated, and the atmosphere became quiet and deserted. In the sun-shading yellow sand, the staff members' mustaches and eyebrows turned black, their faces covered in dust.

At 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a sudden gust of wind swept across the front of the platform, swift and fierce, knocking over the loudspeaker stand. Fortunately, the speaker was not damaged and was still able to command the troops.

The medical staff were quite busy yesterday, treating six athletes, three of whom fainted due to excessive exercise, and the other three of whom suffered from nerve spasms due to the cold weather.

A New Perspective

The students of Xinsheng Elementary School (formerly the Caohejing Children's Home) are particularly admirable. Each of them wore a white T-shirt and a pair of briefs, performing the "Airplane Exercise" in the cold wind, changing formations in countless ways, neither hurried nor slow. Who would have known that these children, who once roamed the streets, would have today's achievements in physique and discipline?

Yesterday afternoon, a young elementary school student named Zha Zhenyuan got lost from his school group on their way back to school and cried incessantly. Later, the Boy Scouts of Xieqiao National School in the Fourth District inquired and sent him home. Doing a good deed every day, acting bravely for a just cause, young people are indeed still lovable.

Quaint and Elegant

The most outstanding group exercise performance was Yisheng Elementary School's Brocade Dance, which was ingenious, beautiful, and unique. Peiben's agricultural dance, performed by both male and female teams, all barefoot and wearing straw sandals, the men wearing straw hats and the women wearing headscarves, was accompanied by violin and drums. The sound and movements were all natural, making it the most classical performance of the day.

The loudspeaker on the platform was the most loyal and busiest worker at the Games, finding people, claiming lost items, issuing commands, and even saying hello, hardly stopping for a minute. Once, a student crossed the track, violating the rules, and the loudspeaker suddenly shouted "Bastard!" causing a shock throughout the venue. Sometimes, when the program was slightly free and the loudspeaker had nothing to do, the faint sound of laughter and chatter could be heard, captivating the audience outside the venue.

The Evening of Transition

The elementary school games ended completely yesterday. Today, the college, high school, and open divisions will officially begin. It is expected that the scene of singing and dancing in the venue will no longer exist, and it will be replaced by tense and intense competition.

Yesterday evening, in the fading twilight, the figures in the venue were sparse. On one side, the elementary schools were striking camp and celebrating their victories; on the other side, the middle schools were setting up camp. The grasshopper-style tents gradually decreased, and the Mongolian yurt-style and seven-star tents rose in their place. Therefore, yesterday evening can be called "The Evening of Transition."

The referees for the field events call the "preliminary rounds" "fatigue roll calls" because there are nearly 200 athletes in each event in the preliminary rounds, trying out throws and jumps... Just calling the names is enough to make their mouths dry and their voices hoarse.

### Economic Commission Drafting Specific Plans to Assist in the Export of Materials; Production and Sales If Development is Possible, Import Quotas Can Be Relaxed

The government regards the export of materials as the source of foreign exchange and has always attached great importance to it. In the past, due to various reasons, the export of materials has not been able to proceed smoothly. Although assisted by foreign exchange policies, the current situation has not yet improved. The difficulties of the export industry have not been resolved. Today, all parties attach importance to the issue of import quotas, but ignore the need to increase exports to seek redress. The current government authorities believe that exports are more important than imports today. If there is a way to export, import quotas can be relaxed. It is learned that the National Economic Commission has begun to draft a specific export plan for exported materials, paying special attention to issues such as the production cost, transportation, and standards of exported materials. As for the use of funds, improvement of technology, supply of raw materials, and smooth transportation, efforts will be made to provide assistance. The Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission has provided various data, and it is expected that this plan will be announced in the short term. There will be new developments in exported materials.

### People's Hearts Turn Towards Prosperity, Merchants Scramble to Buy Cotton Yarn and Cloth, Prices Rise Across the Board; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Soars by Nearly Two Million

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw brisk sales by merchants due to firm prices in various parts of North China. Replica manufacturers in this street feared that the government's unified procurement would delay the allocation procedures, affecting raw materials, so they were actively seeking to stock up, and prices gradually rose. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose by 1.9 million compared to before the holiday, reaching 38.1 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also continued to rise by about 500,000 to 1 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market opened flat in the morning. Later, upon hearing of high prices in Tianjin, Hankou, and other places, merchants bought actively. Local traders in this street, seeing the soaring yarn market and feeling a sense of prosperity, saw a sudden surge in market sentiment. Dyeing and weaving factories frequently absorbed medium-grade fine cloth, and external lifting was also strong. Therefore, in the end, the prices of various grades of fine cloth such as 12-pound Dragon Head soared by 55,000 to 60,000 yuan compared to before the holiday. Four Gentlemen and Golden Lotus Serge were actively bought by merchants, and the prices rose by 65,000 to 40,000 yuan. The price of other valley cloth also remained firm.

Cotton is Now Tight

Yesterday's spot cotton market advanced rapidly. Small-scale yarn factories absorbed heavily, and traders followed suit, with prices rising gradually. In the afternoon, as cotton yarn closed with a sharp advance, owners raised prices, and demand from households was strong, and spot prices remained firm, resulting in very active trading. Transactions in various grades totaled 1,700 bales and 700 bundles. Factory prices opened at 3.97 million for Lingbao, 4.29 million for Dezi cotton, 4.24 million for 41, and 3.72 million for Hanxi. The warehouse delivery price opened at 4.05 million for 1:32 Terring, 4.14 million for Lingbao, 3.927 million for Zhangde, 3.72 million for Hanxi, and 3.44 million for Qidong, with 850 bales traded, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 40,000.

### The Copying Industry Association Requests to Participate in Cotton Yarn Joint Allocation

Nine industry associations in this city, including the copying industry, as well as copying industry associations from five counties in other cities - Changshu, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Wuxian, and Changzhou - recently planned for joint yarn allocation, which the government's Yarn Allocation Committee is overseeing. The copying industry had requested to send representatives to participate together, but did not receive permission from the Textile and Silk Association. These industries believe that the purpose of joint yarn allocation is to achieve a balance between supply and demand for both production and sales. The copying industry is the only channel for actual sales of cotton yarn. If they cannot obtain representative participation, then there will still be many obstacles after the allocation is implemented, which is of great importance to the interests of the industry. They have again jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the National Economic Commission, calling on relevant agencies. The following is an excerpt of their reasons:

The actual sales target for the yarn produced by cotton mills is the copying industry. Therefore, joint yarn allocation must be based on the equipment and output of copying production to make regular and quantitative allocations. Only then can the supply and demand of materials move towards the right track. Furthermore, adjustment techniques must also be made public. Therefore, the organization in charge should be jointly participated in by the copying industry.

Yarn price negotiation should also be reasonable. Producers must consider production costs, while users have no other formal supply channels besides allocated yarn. However, in the past, price negotiations were authorized by the Yarn and Silk Association to a price negotiation subcommittee. The price negotiation subcommittee raised prices because the black market was high. Such price negotiations are enough to stimulate people's hearts. In the future, the copying industry should participate in the review.

When the former Textile Control Committee was in charge of distribution, it would convene copying representatives to attend meetings and provide opinions for the decision of important facilities. Now that joint distribution will thoroughly strengthen and stabilize prices, both supply and demand should reach coordination.

### Wool Fabrics Sales Flourish Again

The wool fabrics market had been sluggish for half a month with weakened trading. Yesterday at the tea party and among the large wholesalers on Chessboard Street, buying and selling became more prosperous again. Seasonable, dark-colored flannels, medium-thick serge, overcoating, M'eltons, riding breeches cloth, cashmere twills, long-pile women's woolens, as well as "Fasi" linings, black carbon linings, shirt linings, and mercerized feather yarn, all saw substantial transactions. Merchants have been adding to their stocks, and both retail and wholesale business has turned lively again. As a result, standard prices have mostly turned from sluggish to stable.

### Sluggish Rice Sales, Both Japonica and Indica Decline

Yesterday, a total of over 18,000 piculs of rice arrived in the North and South markets, with sluggish sales. Although prices were firm inland, due to the surprisingly large arrivals from the Sujia line on the southern route of Shanghai, the market situation plummeted. Early thin rice sharply dropped by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, while Lili Songjiang japonica rice plunged wildly by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Northern japonica rice followed suit and continued to decline by 30,000 yuan. Rice also dropped by 10,000 yuan. White "Yinyuan" followed suit.

Flour prices plummeted by 10,000 yuan due to the sharp drop in rice prices, making people feel uncertain. Although those holding onto bran were firm, actual sales were flat, and prices were squeezed down by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybean cakes, however, moved in Shantou. The factory's current production remained firm. Soybean merchants were still actively buying, but as all goods declined, prices also fell by 10,000 yuan. There was a considerable arrival of "Du" beans, but improvement was still difficult. Prices were cut by 10,000 yuan. Broad beans were unable to rise and were reduced by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Adzuki beans were unmoved in other areas, but prices here continued to fall, with a further drop of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Kidney beans, South Seas selected grades, were slightly active, with high-end goods temporarily flat, but mid-range goods were sluggish and declined by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Cowpeas continued to be taken in Shantou, with high grades stable but secondary grades sluggish, and mid- to low-grades falling back by 10,000 yuan. Red beans also followed suit and fell by 10,000 yuan. Corn from the northern oceans was still falling, with another drop of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame was mixed. Black sesame (for oil) was being strongly sought after, with a gradual rise of 10,000 yuan. White sesame was dull. The local market was still sluggish, with a further decline of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Milk sesame was scarce in both supply and demand, with little movement. Raw peanuts were eagerly absorbed by Cantonese merchants, and prices were temporarily stabilized.

The oil market had more supply than demand, and prices fell sharply. Raw oil was extremely sluggish, with a wild drop of 100,000 yuan. Refined oil followed suit with a drop of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Soybean oil was abundant, and prices dropped sharply by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Clear oil also fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and sesame oil followed with a decline of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Factories lacked delivery of wheat.

### National Bank Auditing Department Announces September Bank and庄 Deposit Amounts

The National Bank Auditing Department yesterday (13th) announced the comparative table of the total amount of deposits and reserve funds of each bank and 庄 nationwide in September, as follows: demand deposits were 2,471,789,839,206.66 yuan, time deposits were 367,108,290,506.26 yuan, the total amount of deposits was 2,838,891,129,712.92 yuan, and the paid-in reserve fund was 391,191,214,533.55 yuan.

### Strong Domestic and Foreign Demand for Cotton Cloth, China Trust Currently Exchanges Cotton Yarn for Cloth

(Report from this newspaper) The Central Trust Bureau is actively handling the export of cotton yarn spun from uncertified foreign cotton. As reported previously in this newspaper, as of yesterday (12th), it had signed contracts to sell a total of 4,200 bales of cotton yarn and over 268,000 bolts of cotton cloth. It is now learned that, at the request of cloth factories, the Bureau will exchange yarn for cloth for export. The exchange rate is approximately one 400-pound bale of 20-count yarn for about 29 bolts of 12-pound fine cloth, each 40 yards long and 36 inches wide. Any cloth factory in this city that has more than 10,000 bolts of 12-pound fine cloth that meet export standards can contact the Bureau's purchasing department for exchange before the end of this month. However, this cloth is exclusively for export. Great importance is attached to quality, and no carelessness is allowed in order to maintain the reputation of domestic products. In addition, the Bureau also has a portion of 32-count and 42-count fine yarn. Part of it has already been exchanged for cotton textiles such as undershirts, handkerchiefs, and shirt poplin for export. There is still a remaining amount. Factories with experience in exporting cotton textiles can also contact the Bureau's purchasing department as soon as possible.

### Buying Interest in Chinese Stocks Picks Up, Wing On Shares Break the 300 Barrier

Although Chinese stocks saw weakness midway through yesterday's trading as yarn and flower merchants closed out their positions, an influx of speculative capital from the northern districts and a rally cry from the northern merchants caused material prices to surge. The afternoon market was further boosted by "cha-chu" (a type of speculative trading), and the market closed in a fiery mood.

In the morning, Wing On shares rose due to reports that US loans would be implemented in installments. Opening at 288 yuan and 297 yuan respectively, they rose to high prices of 292 yuan for immediate delivery and 302 yuan for deferred delivery. Subsequently, the offloading of cash Wing On shares and the selling of deferred delivery shares caused prices to retreat to 283 yuan and 292 yuan respectively. The off-market interest rate opened slightly higher at 16.5 fen and 21 fen. Afterwards, there was a slight rebound, but the force of selling cash Wing On shares to close immediate delivery positions forced prices down to lows of 279 yuan for immediate delivery and 286 yuan for deferred delivery at 11:40 AM. The afternoon close was still raised to 288 yuan and 296 yuan. As a result, compared to the pre-close prices, immediate delivery shares of Wing On, Wah Shing, Great Communication, Hsin Yee slightly rose, while Zhabei, Tong Yee, Mei Ya, China Silk, Matches, New Light, King Lun, Wing Kong, King Fook, New Asia, Underwear, Wah Fung, and Sino-French slightly declined, while Keen Hing, Lai On, China Textile, and Rong Fung were flat. Deferred delivery shares saw slight gains for New Light and King Fook, and Keen Hing, while Wah Fung was flat. Wing On, Hsin Ho, and Mei Ya rose by 0.5%.

In the afternoon market, prices were stable due to signs of activity in material prices. Wing On shares rose to 298 yuan for immediate delivery and 306 yuan for deferred delivery. Finally, with the exchange of "cha-chu" and news that Nanjing merchants were forcefully buying 200 million shares off-market, sentiment was boosted and prices broke through the 300 yuan barrier, reaching highs of 305 yuan and 313 yuan, before closing at 304 yuan and 313 yuan respectively. As a result, compared to the morning close, immediate delivery shares of Wing On, Wah Shing, Hsin Ho, New Light, Wah Fung, Sino-French, and Zhabei each rose by 0.5%, while Lai On and Hsin Yee were flat, and the rest rose slightly. For deferred delivery shares, New Light and Keen Hing rose slightly, while the rest all rose by 0.5%. Off-market, old shares and utility shares were slightly lower, while bank shares rose another 0.5%, and the rest remained stable.

Another report: The premium for cash-deferred arbitrage was slightly higher than the previous session, but bank positions still exceeded long positions. Wing On retreated from 9.5 yuan to 8.2 yuan, Mei Ya retreated from 13 yuan to 12 yuan, Hsin Ho fell from 5 yuan to 4 yuan, New Light was around 1 yuan, and Wah Fung was about 2 yuan and change. Those offering premiums were from 10.5 fen to 13.5 fen, and those requesting premiums were from 13.5 fen to 16.5 fen.

The Direct Tax Bureau sent a letter to the Stockbrokers Association, stating, "Stamp tax is a tax on certificates and is different in nature from transaction tax. There is no double taxation. Please instruct all brokers to affix stamp tax stamps in accordance with Article 16, Item 10 of the Stamp Tax Law."

New China Department Store has completed its increased production and resumed trading, with 100,000 shares traded.

### United Bonds Slightly Weak, Foreign Stocks Rise

Government bonds saw weakness yesterday. United Bonds (丙) opened at 22,500 yuan, with a high of 22,800 yuan and a low of 20,600 yuan, before stabilizing slightly. United Bonds (丙) fell by 2,700 compared to the pre-close price, while other bonds fell by 1,900. Approximately 5 million changed hands.

Foreign stocks were stable in the morning and firm at noon yesterday. External stimulus increased, with Cantonese and Securities merchants both entering the market. Foreign firms sold slightly. The steel industry had special news of excellent dividend payments and was uniquely strong, rising by 20%. Jardine Beers also continued to be strong. Jardine Textiles opened at 202,000 yuan and rose to a new high price of 220,000 yuan by the end of the afternoon. As a result, compared to the pre-close prices, the steel industry rose by over 20%, shipping rose by 10%, plantations fell by 0.5%, and Jardine Textiles, British, Deutz Fahr, Jardine Beverages, and Kwong Paper each rose by 0.5%.

### Artificial Silk Reaches New High Prices Due to Suspension of Allocation News

The artificial silk market yesterday was stimulated by the news of the temporary suspension of allocation, which inevitably led to opportunistic price increases. 120 denier "Xu" brand luster opened as high as 92 million yuan. Although trading was quiet, holders were unwilling to sell, so the midday close rose by 3 million yuan. The afternoon continued to rise, with a final selling price of 5 million yuan. 4A Toray was 86 million yuan in the morning and 88 million yuan in the afternoon, 5 million yuan higher than Tuesday.

Factory Made Rayon

The market yesterday was prosperous due to the high rise of artificial silk. CD grade was quoted at around 67 to 68 million yuan, with all grades quoted up 2 million yuan compared to Tuesday. High grade "Ling Zu" was traded at 66 million yuan, up 1.5 million yuan. Although the transaction of dried rayon was rare, the market also brought up about 2 million yuan yesterday.

Silk Fabrics

Yesterday, the market for silk quilts and silk bedding saw Huaqiang and Dacheng goods opening at 3.7 million for immediate delivery and 850,000 for deferred delivery. However, due to the strength of the shorts, there were continuous sell-offs, and the price fell to a minimum of 550,000 yuan for immediate delivery. The longs took advantage of the low prices to absorb them, and then they went up again. The maximum deferred delivery date reached 4.15 million yuan, and the closing price was 850,000 yuan for immediate delivery and 4 million yuan for deferred delivery. In the afternoon, the market was even more prosperous due to high raw material prices, and off-market transactions were at 4.5 million yuan. Mei Ya goods were 200,000 yuan higher than Dacheng. Other goods, factory made rayon, have been slightly increased due to cost reasons, but actual sales were flat, and transactions were not lively.

### Returned Checks Gradually Decreasing

(Report from this newspaper) Returned checks from various banks and 庄s in this city have gradually decreased after strict crackdowns by the Central Bank and the Financial and Economic Standing Bureau. Yesterday, according to the Central Bank, there were 4,853 returned checks on the 3rd of this month, 2,801 on the 4th, 3,145 on the 5th, 2,368 on the 6th, 2,166 on the 7th, and 2,454 on the 8th. The total amount of returned checks in one week was 135,715,240 yuan, accounting for only a little less than 0.5% of the total amount of exchanges.

### Banks and Bureaus Clearing 44.3 Billion

(Report from this newspaper) Interbank lending was relatively stable yesterday. The positions of various banks and Zhuang were uneven. The National Bank cleared 39.5 billion, the Four Banks and Two Bureaus cleared 44.3 billion, the large clearing banks and Zhuang cleared 72.9 billion, the foreign merchant banks cleared 23.4 billion, the small clearing banks and Zhuang cleared 52 billion, the Bank of China cleared 33.6 billion, the Bank of Communications cleared 30.6 billion, the Agricultural Bank of China cleared 5.2 billion, the Central Trust Bureau cleared 7.8 billion, the Frontier Exchange Bureau cleared 4.5 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury cleared 41.2 billion.

### Sugar Continues to be Tight

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan due to the Taiwan currency exchange rate rising by four yuan. The Association's pricing was 1,001,500 yuan to 1 million yuan for 24-piece white sugar, 1,030,000 yuan for large-package dry spot sugar, 920,000 yuan for spot No. 2 medium sand white sugar, 1,050,000 yuan for Taiwan red sugar, 830,000 yuan for Shantou green sugar, and 810,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan for secondary grades. Xinghua white bag Zhuang was 980,000 yuan to 950,000 yuan for good quality goods, 930,000 yuan for Lou Zhuang, and 870,000 to 880,000 yuan for Xing red sugar. The first batch of new Shunde green sugar opened at 830,000 yuan, and old goods were at 790,000 yuan. Scattered lots of "Diao" green sugar opened at 800,000 yuan, with over 600 pieces opened in total.

Tea Market Quiet

The foreign tea market, which has been silent for a long time, still showed no signs of a turnaround yesterday. The reason is that exporters are stingy with their bids, while sellers are not giving in at all, forming a divergence in negotiations. For domestic tea, the supply in the market is dwindling. Although buying interest is good in the local shops and Zhuang, transactions are always in a narrow path, but the potential is quite sharp.

Telecommunications Special Issue

### Before and After the War—A Comparison of Engineering at the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

— Zhao Li

Telecommunications connect across vast distances in an instant, whether during war or peacetime, as tools for military or commercial battles, their importance cannot be overstated. Shanghai is the center of national politics and economics, and telecommunications need to be connected to large and small cities and towns across the country. One can imagine the importance of its performance and the busyness of its work. Here is a brief comparison of the engineering work of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau before and after the war, which I believe will be welcomed by those concerned about telecommunications administration.

(A) Local Telephone

The total number of telephone users in Shanghai is about 70,000, ranking first among major cities in the country. However, most users are concentrated in the old concession areas, and those in the Hongkou and Nanshi areas account for less than one-tenth of the total number of users. Due to the division of the administrative system in the above two areas at the time of establishment, the management and mechanical programs of local telephones are also different. The former was operated by the American Shanghai Telephone Company, and the machinery was rotary. The latter was operated by the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of our country, and the machinery was step-by-step. The connection between the two areas is established through relay lines. In the early days of the War of Resistance, Shanghai fell. Both the American Telephone Company and the Changhua Bureau were forcibly occupied by the Japanese. In the autumn of the year before last, Shanghai was restored. Our government, in order to take into account the interests of allied nations, returned the local telephones in the old concession area to the American company for operation. As for the local telephones in Zhabei and Nanshi under the jurisdiction of the former Telephone Bureau, they were merged with the telegraph business to form a Telecommunications Bureau in charge.

The city of Shanghai is vast. In addition to urban telephones, suburban telephones have also been developed at the same time. Taking urban telephones as the core, a telephone network is formed. Therefore, the current affiliated institutions of the local telephone under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau include the Hongkou Nanshi Pudong three telephone exchanges and the downtown Wusong Zhenru Longhua Fuxing Island each branch exchange. The installed machine cities are divided into automatic, common battery and magnet types. The mechanical capacity and procedures before and after the war are compared in the table below:

About 2,000 local telephone lines were destroyed during the war. In the past two years after the war, efforts have been made to restore and expand them in response to social needs. However, due to the lack of construction funds, communication equipment, and technical personnel, it is obviously impossible to achieve large-scale expansion in a short period of time. Therefore, the increase in new users must be restricted at present.

(B) Long-Distance Telephone

Long-distance telephones are divided into wired and wireless. Although the engineering equipment is different, the call efficiency is the same. For shorter distances, the cost of setting up poles and wires is not significant, so most calls use wired lines. For longer distances, wireless terminals are used instead of poles and wires, which is more economical and suitable for materials and maintenance. Therefore, wireless calls are more suitable. My country's long-distance telephone business was in its initial stage before the war, and the equipment was simple. The long-distance call mechanical equipment of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau only had six switchboard seats, two recording seats, and two single-channel carrier telephone terminals. After the war, Shanghai's telephone users needed long-distance telephones very eagerly, which can be seen from the busy call situation. Therefore, the machine line equipment has been gradually increased in the past two years to meet the needs; the long-distance wired telephone and wireless telephone engineering equipment are described separately below:

1. Wired Telephone - There are currently eighteen long-distance switchboard seats, six long-distance recording seats, thirty-three wave telephone circuits, twelve copper live lines, and twelve iron telephone lines. Work is done day and night, and a 24-hour call system is implemented for users. As for the distribution of long-distance telephone lines, Shanghai is the core, and its branching can be divided into three: (A) Near-Distance Telephone Network - The near distance of Shanghai is within 100 kilometers. Each city and town area has twelve pairs of 4.5 mm iron telephone lines, which are connected to form a telephone network, reaching Jiading, Taicang, Songjiang, Qingpu, Baoshan, Chuansha, Minhang and other places. (B) South Branch Telephone Network - From Shanghai southward to Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Zhaoxian and other places, the distance is long, and there is much call attenuation, so copper telephone lines are set up instead of iron telephone lines. Also, due to busy calls, the actual number of lines does not match the allocation, so carrier equipment is added to complete the call mission. The current equipment includes three pairs of 2.9 mm copper telephone lines and eight carrier telephone circuits. (C) West Branch Telephone Network - From Shanghai westward through Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang to Nanjing, three copper telephone lines of 3.5 mm diameter are set up. There are two pairs of them, and eight pairs of 2.9 mm diameter. Also, each bureau is equipped with a carrier machine to facilitate calls. There are currently a total of 25 carrier telephone circuits.

2. Wireless Telephone - Wireless telephone equipment can be divided into the following three categories: (A) Three short-wave telephone transmitters for domestic calls, installed at Zhenru Nanxiang Jianguo West Road three transmitting stations. The one installed at Zhenru is a kilowatt machine, reaching Chongqing, Beijing, Tianjin and Hankou. Those installed in Nanxiang and Jianguo West Road are both six-watt machines, reaching Jinan, Qingdao, Guangzhou and Taipei. As for the three receiving machines, they are installed at Liuhang receiving station. There are also three terminals, all installed in the Xubangqiao Bureau Building. (B) Two ultra-shortwave 50-watt transceivers for short-distance difficult calls, installed at the Hengbangqiao Bureau, respectively communicating with Nanjing and Yin County. The machine has a wavelength of four meters and a call distance of about 25 to 50 miles. If the call distance exceeds the above distance, a relay station is set up to assist. Therefore, there are four relay stations between Shanghai and Nanjing in Kunshan, Wuxi, Benniu and Zhenjiang. There is a relay station in Zhangdun between Shanghai and Yin County to complete the call mission. (C) One 2-kilowatt dual-channel single-sideband wireless telephone machine for international calls. The machine can provide two pairs of users to call at the same time. Its transponder is located in Zhenru, the receiver is located in Liuhang, and the terminal is located next to the long-distance station in Yokohama Bridge for easy transfer. The terminal is equipped with security equipment (Split Band Priacy System) to cut the user's voice frequency into several segments, and each segment is frequency-modulated with a different frequency. The frequency-modulated frequency changes every 20 seconds. Therefore, if the same terminal machine is not used to restore it, the user's conversation cannot be heard by others, which is much better than the previous standard three thousand cycle anti-sound security. It is the most modern and economical wireless telephone equipment. It is currently communicating with San Francisco and has been smooth and excellent.

(C) Wired Telegraph and Wireless Telegraph

Before the war, wired telegraph equipment was more developed than wireless. Wired telegraph has a long history. Although it is not as convenient and economical as wireless telegraph in application, in my country's poor economic situation, it is not allowed to abandon the original wired equipment and switch to new wireless equipment due to economic capabilities. The environment is different after reconstruction after the war. It is more appropriate to purchase effective and lightweight wireless transceivers with the same amount of money than to purchase outdated wired telegraph machines. Therefore, at present, the wired telegraph office does not use the machinery damaged or outdated during the war, and replaces it with the latest type of teletype machine. Comparing the number of telegraph machines, there were more before the war than after the war, but in terms of performance and efficiency, the post-war period is certainly better than the pre-war period. As for the comparison of wireless equipment, both the quantity and power are stronger after the war than before the war. The following table shows the comparison separately:

(D) Recent Developments

The current telephone and telegraph equipment is still insufficient for application, especially local telephones. If there is no large-scale expansion, it will not be enough to meet the requirements of all sectors. However, in this period of suppressing rebellion and building the country, the funding is extremely detailed, and it is particularly difficult to apply for foreign exchange. Therefore, the engineering equipment can only be gradually expanded. The following items are currently in progress and planned: (A) Hongkou Exchange added 500 automatic switchboards, 9 domestic long-distance stations, and 14 international technical stations. (B) The relay cables between the Hongkou and Nanshi exchanges and the Shanghai Telephone Company are respectively equipped with one 100-pair and 200-pair armored cable. (C) The new Qibao receiving station centralizes the receiving machine for unified management. (D) Expand the Nanxiang transmitting station, add two second-class transmitters, and add a telegraph machine room. (E) Install the telex central receiving and reporting office and automatic reporting equipment. (F) Increase telex teletypewriters. (G) Add remote control cable from the central office to each radio station. (H) The four-type vacuum tubes of each transmitter are changed to American vacuum tubes. (I) Shanghai and Tianjin wirelessly test the direct reception and transmission of telex teletypewriters.

### Common Sense of Telecommunications: Lecture 3 - How to Use Special Services

— Zhang Jiayu

1. Proofreading (Identifier TC) Generally speaking, with the gradual improvement of telecommunications machinery, the possibility of transmission errors has been reduced to a minimum. However, on the other hand, due to the overly complex structure of Chinese characters, even though the Chinese telecommunications industry has evolved for more than sixty years, up to now, all Chinese telegrams, which account for more than 90% of all incoming and outgoing telegrams, still have to use four-digit code translation for transmission. Therefore, if even one digit is translated or transmitted incorrectly, it will result in a huge discrepancy. For example, the code for the character "十" (ten) in "十牛" (ten oxen) is "0577," while the code for the character "千" (thousand) is "0578." Older telegraph operators with more experience were very familiar with code translation, and even if there were errors, it was not difficult to immediately check and correct them. However, in recent years, telecommunications knowledge has been advancing rapidly, and the knowledge and skills that employees must learn are very extensive. Apart from code translation personnel who specialize in code translation, general telegraph operators cannot afford to spend too much effort memorizing code translation. At the same time, modern high-speed automatic telegraph transmitters transmit telegrams at a rate more than ten times higher than manual machines. During the transmission process, it is impossible to read each character carefully. Due to these factors, errors in telegram transmission are still difficult to avoid absolutely in practice. In response to the above shortcomings, the telegraph office has recently resumed the practice of translating and sending incoming telegrams. If there are very obvious errors in the telegram text, they can be checked and corrected immediately before translation and sending. However, it is not easy to spot errors in Chinese and foreign ciphertext telegrams, as well as Arabic numerals written in parentheses in plaintext telegrams. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of telegrams, the words "校對" (proofreading) (or the TC identifier) can be added to the beginning of the telegram. The receiving telegraph office should, after copying the telegram, send it back to the sending telegraph office once for verification against the original.

For telegrams reporting market quotations in the industrial and commercial sectors, it is best to use the proofreading method as much as possible. For example, suppose a yarn firm in Tianjin intends to entrust a broker at the Shanghai Yarn Exchange to buy cotton yarn on its behalf. It has previously sent a telegram notifying the broker to buy ten bales of 42-count Blue Phoenix brand cotton yarn when the price falls to 25 million yuan per bale. However, due to carelessness during transmission, the price of 25 million was mistakenly transmitted as 26 million, causing the broker to buy on behalf of the firm when the price fell to 26 million yuan per bale. Shortly afterward, the market price continued to fall to 25 million yuan or even below 25 million yuan per bale. Only when the broker and the client settled the account did they realize that the incorrect transmission had resulted in an unexpected loss. The telegraph office is only responsible for refunding the telegraph fee according to the regulations and is not liable for any other compensation. If the sender had used the proofreading method when sending the telegram, this kind of error would not have occurred.

Having said that, the telegraph office is now making every effort to ensure the accuracy of telegram transmission. All important numbers written in parentheses in the telegram text are now required to be retransmitted once for verification. However, for the sake of the sender, the fee for using the proofreading special service is only half the price of an ordinary telegram (assuming the ordinary telegraph fee is 1,000 yuan per word, then regardless of whether the original telegram is express, urgent, or ordinary, the additional proofreading fee should be 500 yuan per word). The cost is small, but it has a great effect on improving the accuracy of telegrams. Why not do it?

2. Prepaid Reply Fee of Several Yuan (Identifier RP...) Telegrams using the special service of prepaid reply fees are equivalent to letters with return postage stamps attached. Suppose a certain Mr. Jia living in Hankou prepares to entrust a certain Mr. Yi living in Shanghai to inquire about the market price of a certain commodity in Shanghai and hopes that Mr. Yi will reply by telegram. However, Mr. Jia and Mr. Yi have rarely had economic dealings in the past, and according to the regulations, the telegraph fee for sending telegrams must be paid by the sender. In order not to make Mr. Yi bear the telegraph fee for sending a reply, Mr. Jia can indicate "预付回电费若干元" (prepaid reply fee of several yuan) or "RP... (yuan)" identifier at the beginning of the telegram and pay the Hankou telegraph office the approximate amount of the reply telegram fee from Shanghai to Hankou, along with the telegraph fee for his own telegram to Mr. Yi in Shanghai.

After receiving the telegram from Hankou with the "预付回电费若干元" (prepaid reply fee of several yuan) identifier, the Shanghai telegraph office will immediately issue a prepaid reply fee voucher indicating the value, seal it in the telegram, and send it to Mr. Yi. Within three months from the date of receiving this voucher, Mr. Yi can use the voucher to send a telegram to the telegraph office at the same price as the value stated on the voucher, without additional charges. However, if the reply telegram fee exceeds the amount of the prepaid reply fee, the excess amount should be paid by Mr. Yi. If the reply telegram fee is lower than the amount of the prepaid reply fee, the remaining amount will be refunded by the Hankou telegraph office to Mr. Jia (the original sender) upon request by Mr. Jia (the sender) or Mr. Yi (the recipient). Furthermore, Mr. Yi's use of the voucher to send a reply telegram is not limited to sending it to the original sender who paid the prepaid reply fee. In other words, Mr. Yi can also use the prepaid reply fee paid by Mr. Jia to send a telegram to anyone living in any place within the country where telegram service is available.

If Mr. Yi receives a telegram from Mr. Jia with a prepaid reply fee but does not want to accept Mr. Jia's prepaid reply fee out of friendship, and voluntarily pays the fee to send a reply telegram, or does not want to accept Mr. Jia's entrustment at all, he can return the prepaid reply fee voucher to the telegraph office within three months of receiving it and request notification to the original sending office to refund the full amount of the reply fee to Mr. Jia.

### Introduction to Emerging Businesses: What is a Night Letter Telegram?

— Tao Yong

The origin of night letter telegrams: "Night letter telegrams" were originally a type of letter telegram, facilitating the sending of telegrams with longer texts. They have been available in Europe and the United States for a long time. Although some people in China have advocated for them earlier, they were delayed in implementation due to insufficient cost-effectiveness and difficulties in operation. Recently, the Telecommunications Administration is actively promoting the business and resolutely ignoring all kinds of difficulties in equipment, economy, and personnel, opening night letter telegrams to facilitate the public. This is worth introducing.

Features and advantages: Night letter telegrams are similar in nature to reduced-price calls at night; because the telegraph office is busy during the day, it uses the relatively quiet opportunity at night to deliver them later. In other words, it will be transmitted after ordinary telegrams. But its price is half the price of an ordinary telegram. In order to save money, a telegram with more words can be sent as a night letter telegram.

Delivery time: According to regulations, if the receiving office receives it during the day, it should be delivered on the same evening (after 7:00 PM); if it is delivered to the receiving office at [some undefined] time, it will be delivered at any time.

Billing and word count: Night letter telegrams can only be limited to Chinese or English plaintext. Each telegram is calculated based on a minimum of 25 words. That is, even if it is less than 25 words, it is also calculated as 25 words. After this, the fee is calculated by the word. The Chinese night letter telegram fee is 500 yuan per word, and the English fee is 1,000 yuan per word, which is equal to half the price of an ordinary telegram. The code translation fee is still the ordinary price of 100 yuan per word.

Payment identification: This type of telegram should indicate "夜信" (night letter) or the English "NLIT" at the beginning of the telegram (that is, before the recipient's name and address) as payment identification. Both are charged as one word.

Applicable special services: Night letter telegrams can also be used with special services such as "prepaid reply fee," "multiple delivery," and "notification of delivery." However, the Chinese "prepaid reply fee" must not be less than 12,500 yuan, and the English must not be less than 25,000 yuan. The "copying fee" is charged according to the ordinary telegram copying fee. "Notification of delivery" adds 12 words of telegram fee to the night letter telegram fee (that is, 6,000 yuan for Chinese and 12,000 yuan for English). "Notification of delivery by letter" adds the postage of a registered letter.

How to use it: If we send a telegram and the number of words is too many, it is very uneconomical. If this telegram does not have anything urgent, we may wish to use a night letter telegram. In terms of time, if the time of sending is in the afternoon or evening, then using a night letter telegram is not slow, and the cost is half of an ordinary telegram. Why not do it if it's not urgent?

Opening locations: Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, Changsha, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Luoyang, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, [some undefined], Changchun, Taipei, Kaifeng, Wuxi Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Yongjia, [some undefined], Xuzhou, Wuhu, Hefei, [some undefined], Yichang, Hengyang, Jiujiang, Ji'an, Wanxian, Yibin, [some undefined] county, Hechuan, Neijiang, Guangyuan, Shaoguan, Shantou, Xiamen, Tangshan, Xifengning [some undefined], etc. 50 places.

### Red Leaves

— Wang Baili

Travels of Lao Can "All the way autumn mountains red leaves, old [some undefined] yellow flowers," now is the time [some undefined]. After visiting the Chrysanthemum Exhibition of the Republic of Revival, I can't help but quickly think of red leaves.

The earliest user of the words "red leaves" should be "red leaves poem", Qing Suo Gao Yi said: "During the Tang Chuanzong, Yu You picked up a leaf in the imperial ditch, with a poem on it, You also wrote a poem on the discarded one, placed it on the upper reaches of the ditch, (whether it can be upstream, I will [some undefined] it) The rich Han Madam picked it up, and later, the emperor released the palace maidens, Han married You into etiquette, each took red leaves from [some undefined] to show each other, saying: "Thank you for the matchmaking". Han said "Fang knows red leaves are good matchmakers". Yunxi Yuyi also said that in the Xuanzong Dynasty, there was a story of writing red leaves and flowing with the stream, which can be seen in the Ciyuan "red leaves poem" item. According to Xizong is the grandson of Xuanzhong, (Xuanzong passed on to Zong [some undefined] Zong passed on to [some undefined] Zong) that is, this matter has been flattened in Xuanzong's time, but at that time, because there were no poems circulated, the story was not [some undefined]. In short, the source of the words "red leaves" is guided by Du Mu's poem "box leaves are redder than February flowers", Mu's mountain poem said: "Far up the cold mountain stone path is inclined, white clouds deep where there is a home; stop the car and sit to love the maple forest Xiao, frost leaves redder than February flowers". After that, "red leaves" appeared in the song [some undefined], that is [some undefined] is not uncommon. But the most thought-provoking person who chants "red leaves" is Cui Shousheng of the Qing Dynasty. Cui has a "Like a Dream" word that says: "For the love of the late scenery of Wujiang, the ferry is reflected by the setting sun; the water is like peach blossoms, countless swimming fish mistaken. The wind is still, the wind is still, the same fallen red is piled on the path".

### Phibun and Siam

— Zheng Fan

A coup d'état took place in Siam on the 9th. The rebel army led by Phibun controlled the Siamese government in an instant, then amended the constitution and reorganized the cabinet. They completely achieved the goal of seizing power without bloodshed.

No matter how long this new government can last, one fact is very clear: Phibun is red again. Although he knows that he does not conform to international sentiment, he did not participate in actual government affairs in the new cabinet, but he is obviously the behind-the-scenes power that controls the entire Siam.

Who exactly is the Phibun who instigated this coup?

We should not forget! Siam's style in this war was like Hungary in Europe. It participated in the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" and declared war on the Allied countries against its own strength. The then Prime Minister of Siam (the face of going to Japan to meet Tojo is still in front of me,) was Marshal Phibun today.

We will not forget either: For more than ten years, the three million Chinese compatriots who lived in Luo suffered countless cruel discriminations, humiliations, and even massacres. The head of the leaders who presided over and implemented these anti-Chinese policies was also Marshal Phibun.

From this point of view, the essence of the new Siamese government after this coup is not difficult to imagine. The future trend of Luo is indeed worthy of our attention.

Seizing power by armed rebellion was originally Phibun's specialty. The famous Cheng Luo coup in 1932 was his first shot. The "Siamese Military Power Group" led by Phibun "revolved" the Siam ruled by monarchs and nobles, and he himself seized the harvest of the great change, colluding with a part of the feudal forces to consolidate his rule; on the one hand, he used the most blatant means to plunder and destroy the industrial and commercial enterprises of overseas Chinese.

In this way, he drove out the Seventh Emperor and dragged in a little baby in his teens, and honored him as the Eighth Emperor. This Eighth Emperor has always lived in Switzerland, and he has never even heard of the things of Luo, and even if he heard of it, the teenager in his teens would hardly be able to ask. All state affairs had to be entrusted to Phibun to take care of. Therefore, after a period of dishonorable "internal [some undefined] Qing", Phibun concurrently served as Prime Minister and handled seven important positions including internal affairs, foreign affairs, and military affairs. The puppet show he made was thus successfully completed.

Phibun's character can be included in the three words "arrogant", "stubborn" and "competitive". He graduated from the German military academy and extremely admired the style of the German National Socialist Party. Therefore, the most proud masterpiece after he took office was the so-called "nationalism", that is, the so-called Greater Thai nationalism. Obviously, this was learned from Germany's Greater Germanicism. Its actual content includes dictatorship, militarism, and xenophobia (in fact, there is nothing else to exclude, only anti-Chinese), that is, Hitler-style reckless and crazy madness.

His policy is pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese. He wanted to use his "ally" Japan as a shield to threaten Annam and the United Kingdom and the United States. On the other hand, he wanted to maintain neutrality to coerce Japan, hoping to fish in troubled waters. He dreamed of controlling Annam, and in the name of the Greater Thai, he wanted to extend the northern border of Siam to the Yangtze River in our country. He insisted on his dream and did not hesitate to be humble and to please Japan in every possible way. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Siam's value suddenly doubled, and Phibun was naturally very proud. He finally became a vassal of the "ally" Japan, and actually declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in order to "build Greater East Asia". Unfortunately, Phibun's wishful thinking did not work out. Japan surrendered, Phibun's good dream was over, and he was once detained as a "Siamese traitor" for some time.

Siam is naturally not without people who love democracy and peace. Although under Phibun's dictatorial regime, anti-dictatorial waves are often launched. Therefore, Phibun suffered two bullets in 1935. He did not die. Immediately, fifty officers were sentenced to death by him; in 1938, he was assassinated for the second time. Poison was pre-set in the night meal, and he did not die again. Seventeen officials were immediately imprisoned by him. Phibun's poisonous methods of dealing with political enemies have long been "thundering" internationally.

Let’s talk about some of Phibun’s “virtuous governance” against overseas Chinese! Under “nationalism”, the suffering of overseas Chinese is indescribable. The property of overseas Chinese may be “nationalized” at any time, and the reading of the motherland’s text in overseas Chinese schools is unreasonably restricted. Phibun often instructed his subordinates to set fires and looting in overseas Chinese concentrated areas; overseas Chinese newspapers did not dare to speak except to act as a mouthpiece for Phibun. News reporters were in danger of being assassinated at any time, and Mr. [some undefined] Guangyan was one of them.

### Two Terrifying Islands

— Broken Wheel

There are two terrifying islands in the world, which are simply living hells on earth; because both islands are used to imprison prisoners. One is in France, called Devil's Island; the other is in Taiwan, called Green Island.

Devil Bird is a famous place in France for imprisoning prisoners. It was established in 1852 and has a history of one hundred years. The island is surrounded by fierce sharks, dangerous quicksand and wild animals, and there are almost no traces of humans; therefore, prisoners have no way to escape. The life that these prisoners live is like a devil. Therefore, only one-tenth of the prisoners sent there live to five years. According to statistics, the island has imprisoned more than 70,000 prisoners. The prisoners have to work and live by farming; work is rewarded, two francs a day, and you can get forty francs of tickets at the end of the month. The houses are built and repaired by the prisoners themselves, with the words "Salvation Army House" and "House of Hope" written on them, because the manager is always a Salvation Army officer "Charles Bin". He was sent to work on the island after the First World War. But it was not until 1946 that the French authorities cancelled it.

Green Island is in the Pacific Ocean east of the main island of Taiwan, 18 miles from Taitung. Anyone in Taiwan who was deemed by the Japanese to be hindering his rule was sent to this isolated island to be punished for hard labor and never released until death. The island also has a simple prison; prisoners who have just arrived are imprisoned, and shackles can be removed during the day after two or three years of opening. The prison is surrounded by electric nets to prevent escape and rebellion. On the beach, ships are not allowed to dock or approach the island, and prisoners are not allowed to approach the beach, otherwise they will be shot to death.

After our country received Taiwan, this island was liberated, and all mortals were released. Now it has become a deserted island with no human habitation.

### Bernath Reveals: Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy

— Shan

This news came at night. It was not until the next morning that I visited the President and me. I immediately went to the White House, and the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Army arrived soon after. Admiral Leehe advocated accepting Japan's proposal immediately. I said to the President that I would consider it again before answering this document.

I said: "Why should we retreat from the demand for unconditional surrender? This was proposed before the atomic bomb was dropped and the Soviet Union joined the war. If any conditions are to be accepted, they should be put forward by the United States, not Japan." The President agreed with my view and ordered me to draft a reply. The article includes three main points: Since the surrender, the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Imperial Government to rule the country shall be placed under the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. The Japanese government and the Japanese Imperial General Staff shall order and ensure that they sign the surrender conditions in order to fulfill the Potsdam Declaration. And immediately ordered the Japanese army to stop fighting. According to the Potsdam Declaration, a government of free will of the Japanese people was established before and after.

This reply document was sent out on August 11. I firmly believed that Japan would be able to accept it. It was not until 4:00 pm on the 14th that we received a call from our Ambassador to Switzerland, Ha Zhicheng, informing me of the content of the Japanese [some undefined] Wen. I ordered the Ministry of Land to connect the wireless circuits of London, Moscow and Chongqing, and inform the foreign ministers of the three countries of Harryson's news. At half past five, I reported the process of the conversation to the President, and all measures were approved. At six o'clock, Mr. Grassley, the diplomatic representative of the Swiss Embassy, ​​visited and read the Japanese document to me. An hour later, President Truman announced to the world the result of this most terrible war.

Everything before Japan's surrender will be recorded in detail in the future. According to inquiries from senior Japanese officials and the public documents obtained, Japan knew nothing about Stalin's intentions five weeks before the surrender. It was not until July 6, 1945, when Chinese Foreign Minister Song Ziwen arrived at the Grassco, that the Japanese suspected the Soviet Union's intentions. At that time, Foreign Minister Tojo said: "We know that Mr. Song received an excellent reception in Moscow and had discussions with Stalin...maybe some treaty will be concluded. It can be seen that even at that time, the efficiency of Japan's intelligence work was not strong. (The full translation will be published soon, reservations or Shen Bao)
