### The Question of Recovering Macau; Negotiations Will Be Submitted When the Time Is Ripe

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] The issue of Macau has recently become the focus of attention for all parties. Some patriots have even launched a movement to recover Macau. According to sources, Article 2 of the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of 1887 stipulates that Macau will be under Portuguese "perpetual administration." From our point of view, this provision is of course an unequal treaty. However, the Portuguese side believes that it is a final decision.

Therefore, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiates with Portugal to abolish its special rights in China, it is feared that the Macau issue will delay the exchange of letters. The abolition of the country's special rights has been decided to be resolved with Portugal through the exchange of letters first. The Macau issue will be closely monitored at any time, and negotiations will be proposed when the time is ripe.

According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our government is extremely unwilling to have White Russian groups that constitute anti-Soviet activities as referred to in Article 6 of the Outline of the Sino-Soviet Settlement of Outstanding Issues in 1924 exist in the city's territory.

Therefore, our government has ordered the relevant local authorities to conduct a close investigation of the behavior of White Russian groups and take appropriate measures. However, it also pointed out that in recent months, newspapers, organs, and communication groups in the Soviet Union have continued to spread anti-China papers and messages. The Ministry has submitted written and oral requests to the Soviet side, demanding that the Soviet government earnestly correct the words of the Soviet newspapers, organs, and communication groups that support and encourage Chinese groups that attempt to overthrow the Chinese government by force.

The document concerns the legal status of the territories surrounding Japan, especially the legal status of Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, and some smaller islands. The Japanese government did not make any formal demands in this document but pointed out that, according to the Potsdam Declaration, territorial issues can only be explicitly resolved in the peace treaty. The document implied that Japan was severely affected by the loss of territory, so it proposed interim measures. As for Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, which are currently occupied by Soviet forces, Japan has given up all hope of regaining these territories but wants to obtain fishing rights in their waters. Japan recognizes Taiwan as Chinese territory but hopes Japan can obtain special immigration rights in Taiwan. As for the Ryukyu Islands, which are occupied by the United States, its main island is Okinawa. Japan also hopes that no country should obtain sovereignty over the islands. The Japanese government did not propose any specific solutions, only stating that from a racial, economic, and cultural point of view, the Ryukyu Islands should be jointly administered by the United States and Japan, with the United States retaining some military bases, but all civil administration should be managed by Japan.

### MacArthur Headquarters Notifies All Countries Japanese Reparation Goods Divided into Two Categories Catalogs Prepared and Will Be Distributed to Representatives of All Countries

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] MacArthur Headquarters released a booklet today, disclosing that Japanese reparation assets have been divided into two major categories for distribution to requesting nations. One category will be shipped out as entire factory units, and the other will be distributed by item as individual equipment. The newly established Reparations Technical Advisory Committee met here today. Eleven United Nations reparations representatives attended and were given the booklet. It stipulates that equipment in former aircraft factories, arsenals, and private arms factories, such as machine tools, metal parts, and other general industrial equipment, will be distributed as individual components rather than as entire factories. The other category includes entire factories, such as steel, iron, machine tool, and caustic soda factories. The distribution of entire factories will be carried out to the greatest extent possible. Japanese factory personnel, under the supervision of the U.S. Eighth Army, have completed most of the compilation of the equipment catalog, which lists the model, size, condition, power, country of manufacture, and date of manufacture of each piece of equipment. The catalog will be distributed to the reparations delegations of all countries. The catalog of entire factories will list and analyze the essential structures and performance of each factory, so that requesting countries can make preliminary selections based on the catalog. Requesting countries must state the expected date of shipment of the desired reparations and declare the intended use of the entire factory they are requesting.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The Chinese reparations delegation to Japan will divide into two groups to visit 27 machinery factories (nine of which are in the Tokyo area). One group will go to Niigata, Toyama, and other cities in northern Japan, and the other will go to Osaka, Kobe, Shizuoka, and other cities in southern Japan. The Chinese reparations delegation has already visited thirteen machinery factories.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] According to a responsible person from the Executive Yuan Reparations Committee: (1) The Allied Headquarters will soon specifically designate the equipment to be supplied by Japan for reparations, but it will not be limited to the necessary materials for dismantling the entire factory, and partial relocation will be carried out first. (2) Reparation materials will primarily be heavy industry goods, which are not suitable for the needs of our private light industry. (3) Japanese industry will be maintained at the 1930-1934 level, and the items to be dismantled are not new.

### Gandhi's Compassionate Heart Says India Should Not Demand Reparations from Japan

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 2nd] Indian saint Gandhi published an article in the "Harijan" weekly today, titled "International Thieves," which stated: Taking advantage of someone's misfortune or kicking a person when they are down is not morally permissible. It is rumored that India is dissatisfied with the textile machinery it received from Japan and has requested an increase. If this is true, India will have imperialistic tendencies. India should not participate in the Allied reparations plan against Japan. We sincerely hope that the interim government will not lead us down the path that Japan has been on for a century.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng delivered a commemorative speech for the 6/3 Opium Suppression Day on the Central Broadcasting Station tonight, titled "Opium Suppression and International Status." Zhang first described the history of China's participation in international opium suppression cooperation and pointed out that the promotion of domestic anti-drug policies and the improvement of international status are closely related and echo each other. Zhang continued, "After World War II, the United Nations, considering that the harm of drugs is greater than war, convened the first United Nations Opium Suppression Conference in New York in November of last year, based on the provisions of the Charter. In addition to reviewing the production, trafficking, and use of drugs in various countries during the war in order to strengthen control, an international agreement was also discussed, explaining the acceptance of the League of Nations' authority to control drugs and continuing to abide by the obligations stipulated in previous conventions. During the conference, representatives from various countries praised our country's perseverance in resisting the enemy during the war while continuing to suppress opium. However, on certain issues, such as overseas Chinese smoking and transporting drugs, sailors smuggling, and opium cultivation on national borders, there were still well-intentioned criticisms and expectations for improvement. In order not to disappoint friendly countries and to protect the country's external credibility, in addition to sincerely accepting these criticisms, we should further conduct strict self-examination and courageous self-improvement."

### The desolate scene of Southern Shandong after the war; Yanzhou's city defenses are heavily fortified

— Special correspondent's tour of Southern Shandong for this newspaper, Part Two

Stepping onto Northern Jiangsu and entering Southern Shandong, this ancient and modern battlefield lies in ruins, evoking boundless sorrow!

In the vast countryside, due to the people's displacement and wandering, fields lay barren, and thousands of miles were covered in red sand, becoming a common and unsurprising sight. This land, already deficient in natural endowments, is now further afflicted by human-made disasters, making it appear even more desolate.

As our reporter traveled north along the Jinpu Railway, the first impression was seeing children in the villages, all with big bellies and small heads, like naked "models." It was felt that these young lives had already begun to suffer from unhealthy living conditions. For the common people in this area, getting to eat cornbread was already a great blessing, and when it came to eating tree bark and grass roots, everyone probably had their own set of "new recipes."

Early summer brought a severe drought, and the red, yellow sandy soil was even drier, like a furnace. This year's wheat harvest was reduced, with some places only able to harvest 50% of the crop. The hard work of the common people was invisibly met with a significant loss.

Many younger men were unwilling to continue working in the fields, shaking their heads and reluctantly leaving their homes. The better ones simply took up rifles and became soldiers, while the worse ones gave a shout and simply went into the mountains to become bandits.

As a result, a characteristic feature here is that there is no need to worry about a shortage of soldiers. The large men of Shandong do not take being a soldier seriously. Although they clearly know that this is "risking their lives," when they think about working in the fields and still not being able to get a full meal, they believe that "joining the army" is more free and unrestrained. At least they don't have to worry about food and clothing. They can spend the whole day holding a gun, training, and easily eat a few bowls of ready-made rice, which they consider quite satisfying.

In a small wheat field in Yanzhou city, we met an old farmer in his fifties who was drawing water from a well to irrigate the dry land. Here, we saw that the bucket of water he could use to irrigate the farmland would only be enough to water flowers in Jiangnan. But he was so calm and accepting, attributing everything to fate and destiny. As we chatted, we learned that he had spent thirty years by this well. The bluestone slab under his feet had been polished smooth over the years.

The conversation turned to his family affairs. One of his sons, because he was unwilling to continue working in the fields, had joined the army three years ago. Until now, he had not only not returned to his hometown, but he had not even sent a letter. The old farmer said with emotion: "I am already old now, otherwise, joining the army would really be better than this."

When asked about the bandit situation nearby, he casually said: "This is not a big deal. Our city defenses are good. A thousand or eight hundred of them can't even think about getting close to us." He said: "The Communist regular troops besieged us for more than a year, but we still drove them back. They didn't even move a hair on our heads."

Mentioning the last siege of Yanzhou, it was indeed a fierce battle. On this small point, the two sides actually held out for more than a year, which is truly hard to imagine. The defending general, Wu Huawen, preserved this small place under absolutely difficult circumstances, which must have required a firm will. At the same time, the forty or fifty locomotives and one hundred and several dozen freight cars at Yanzhou Station on the Jinpu Railway were not destroyed, which was even more...

However, we should understand that the reason why the battle of Yanzhou could be sustained for so long also had another important factor. The special environment of Yanzhou and the kind people also made an indelible contribution. Yanzhou is a place with a large city and a small population. Therefore, half of the city is almost entirely occupied by farmland. Entering the city and walking on the roads is no different from walking on the roads outside the city. The wheat fields on both sides create a pastoral city with a very strong natural atmosphere. Thinking back to the siege period, it unexpectedly played a major role. When the defending soldiers were fighting on the city walls, the common people were also working hard to increase production in the fields. Therefore, they were able to barely support such a long battle in a state of semi-starvation while fighting and eating.

Now, when we see the city of Yanzhou after the lifting of the siege, it has become stronger because of the past battle experience. The layers of military defenses and clusters of fortresses, protected by barbed wire and staghorn trees, create an image of such heavily fortified defenses that they would make bandits lose their courage and retreat in fear.

Editorial

### Heighten vigilance against Japan!

Since the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference broke up in discord, there has been a very obvious trend internationally: everyone feels that since it is not easy to sign peace treaties with Germany and Austria for the time being, the future direction of peace efforts must be shifted from Europe to the Far East. After returning to the United States from Moscow, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall began to consider ways to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. Supreme Allied Commander MacArthur has also repeatedly called for the Allies to accelerate the work of concluding a peace treaty with Japan in Tokyo recently. When the British House of Commons discussed foreign policy on May 16, Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed special concern for Britain's interests in the Far East, saying that "Britain hopes to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, and Australia and Canada are particularly concerned about this." Moreover, Britain will soon convene a conference of autonomous territories to discuss the common attitude that Britain and its autonomous territories should adopt towards Japan. As for our country, because how to clean up the aftermath of the war in the Far East has a very close relationship with our country's security, China has hoped to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible from the day Japan surrendered, so as to quickly stabilize the situation in the Far East. However, due to the international situation, it has been delayed until today, which has already made our country impatient. Recently, former U.S. President Hoover also made a surprising statement, advocating excluding the Soviet Union and concluding separate peace treaties with Germany and Japan. Although the U.S. State Department said it did not attach much importance to Hoover's proposal, the U.S. newspapers all felt great interest. The urgency with which the American people hope to conclude a peace treaty with Japan can also be seen from this.

Japan, in the atmosphere of the Allies unanimously hoping to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, is also actively preparing to cope with this future international conference. This is within our expectations. But according to a Tokyo dispatch from Agence France-Presse on the 2nd, former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida notified Supreme Allied Commander MacArthur on May 10 of Japan's views and hopes regarding the peace treaty. The content was a secret document drafted by the Japanese Foreign Ministry. According to well-informed sources in Tokyo, the main points are: (1) Japan hopes to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States; the United States will retain some military strategic points; but all civil administration will be handled by Japan. (2) Japan recognizes Taiwan as Chinese territory, but hopes that Japan can obtain special immigration rights in Taiwan. (3) Although Japan has given up all hope of regaining this territory for Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, it wants to be able to obtain fishing rights in its waters.

Other important requirements, of course, are not yet fully understood by the outside world; but judging from the above three points alone, Japan's ambition is not dead, which is as clear as daylight. The Allies have controlled Japan for nearly two years, and have failed to extinguish Japan's ambition to invade again. This can be taken as an ironclad proof. We cannot but admit that MacArthur's control of Japan, disarming Japan, clearing Japan's aggressive thinking, and promoting the democratization of Japanese politics have indeed achieved considerable political achievements; but observing from another angle, MacArthur, under the false pretenses of the Japanese people's flattery and ingratiation, treats Japan with excessive leniency after all. Indulgence is enough to breed treachery, and the result of the United States adopting this policy will inevitably harm itself and others. Therefore, we have to remind the government and the public that Japan's every word and deed towards the United States is quite similar to the story of "Goujian serving Fucha" in our country's history. The United States should be careful not to be fooled by Japan. Because the consequences of the United States being fooled will not only threaten the United States' security in the Pacific, but also the entire Far East will have no peace. Therefore, when we heard this shocking news, we had to stand up and call on the U.S. diplomatic authorities to ask the United States to be careful not to be fooled.

As for China's basic attitude towards Japan, our country's authorities have repeatedly stated that, in essence: (1) Regarding the issue of Japanese compensation, we will seek a solution based on the requirements of justice and fairness; the future living standards of the Japanese people promised by the Allies will also be determined in accordance with this principle. (2) Regarding Japan's military equipment, in order to eradicate the scourge of aggression and guarantee lasting peace, we advocate that all of it be dismantled. After the conclusion of the future peace treaty with Japan, it should be jointly monitored by the United Nations. Therefore, China does not deny the Japanese people the right to live their normal lives, and is also very willing to "be kind to others," hoping that Japan can also become a peaceful and democratic country. However, for the sake of our own security, and also for the sake of peace in the Far East, we firmly oppose letting it indulge its ambition to invade again.

Recently, Japan's restless movements have become obvious. Once it tried to demand a reduction in industrial equipment used as compensation; then it unexpectedly proposed that the Allies give Japan a "small amount of military force." Recently, it came up with these three far-fetched requirements, which are enough to prove that Japan's ambition is not dead and it attempts to invade again. Therefore, we ask the people of the country to especially heighten their vigilance against Japan, and at the same time hope that the United States will be careful not to be fooled and will not indulge Japan's slightest remaining ambition to invade again.

### Do not create more unemployment!

Everyone has a job and improves their living standards. This is the slogan of modern politicians. Living and working in peace and contentment, and everyone has enough to live on. This is the wish of the former rulers. Although the statements are different, the purpose is the same. Nothing more than to make everyone live a life with an abundance of food and clothing and that everyone is able to find their place in society.

In industrialized countries, because of the concentration of capital, the middle class gradually declines, and the majority of the people are forced to fall into the position of employees. The number of unemployed and employed people directly affects the lives of the people and indirectly relates to the national fortune and social security. Therefore, the central and local governments attach great importance to domestic unemployment relief and methods of assisting employment, and they all do their due diligence. Since the victory of the Allies, because of the demobilization of the army, the reduction of the munitions industry, and the losses suffered by many production enterprises that are difficult to restore, the unemployment situation in various countries should be quite serious. But on the contrary, countries such as Britain and the Soviet Union are not only not serious, but also show a lack of labor. This cannot but be attributed to their foresight.

In our country, even in peacetime, there are no complete and reliable statistics on the number of unemployed people. Looking at the decline of the rural areas, the shrinking of production, and the large-scale disturbances by the Communists today, if we can get a number for the displaced and those who have stopped farming and working, I think this number must be very alarming and it is definitely not something that can be taken care of with the establishment of "institutions" and assigned employment to with the existing factories. Take Shanghai as an example, the number of unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear is no more than several thousand, but it has taken more than a year and they have not been able to assign all of them employment. How can we say that the number of unemployed people throughout the country would be ten thousand times greater than that number? When we say this, we are not saying that the responsible authorities have failed to do their job. It is really that industry and commerce are too depressed, there are too many obstacles, and there are too few opportunities for employment. Not only is there not enough porridge to feed all the monks and there is no way to allocate it, but also a cup of water cannot save a cartload of burning firewood and the commercial market is unable to help the situation. Haven't we seen the events of wage cuts, factory closures, etc. emerge endlessly in the past few months? In fact, the increase in unemployment is even greater than the number of people who can possibly be assigned employment. And this phenomenon is in place, and after the lifting of the living expenses index, it is feared that factories will be unable to bear the burden of excessive wages and it will become even more serious.

Then, how should the current unemployment problem be handled? Can we turn a blind eye and let it end without resolution? Of course, we can give it a negative answer. Because if people cannot make a living, they will take risks, which has always been the main factor in causing great chaos. Try to open up history and it is not easy to find exceptions. Therefore, if we want social stability and political stability, then the most urgent task should be this unemployment problem.

There are too many unemployed people now, it is too difficult to assign them employment, temporary relief is too incomplete, and the cost is too high. It is also definitely not something that today's finances can fully bear permanently. Therefore, we believe that if we want an effective solution, we must find another way. The easiest way should be to start with not increasing unemployment or hindering employment.

Just analyze the reasons for the current unemployment and we can know that most of the unemployment cannot but be said to be man-made, that is to say, it is not unavoidable. For example, in war-torn areas, soldiers and bandits are indistinguishable and nine out of ten houses are empty. The surviving people after the disaster have no choice but to help the old and push the young, and flee everywhere. Are these refugees really unemployed people who have no jobs to take? Also, in places where corvée labor is too heavy and there are too many harsh taxes, the general labor force suffers from the lack of guarantee for their lives and property, and has to move from place to place and scatter in all directions. Are these vagrants really unemployed people who have no jobs to take? Everyone knows that because of the dumping of foreign goods and the excessive decline in agricultural products, many farmers are unwilling to suffer losses and would rather leave their fields barren and avoid production. Are these disguised idlers really unemployed people who are unwilling to take jobs? As for the general industry, in the early days of rehabilitation, new enterprises sprung up like mushrooms. Every time when enemy and puppet factories were put up for sale, they all rushed to be the first, fearing to fall behind. Who knew that before long, they would suddenly turn a blind eye and no one would bid! Those who have already started working, either claim losses and apply for liquidation, or use reasons such as power and raw materials to request dismissal and reduction of workers. Those who try to expand and hire workers are extremely rare. Even if they are forced by need and have to increase workers, they often use the guise of temporary workers or apprentices, in order to avoid trouble and reduce the burden. The reasons for the phenomenon of increasing unemployment or reducing employment opportunities are very complicated, but they cannot be completely attributed to the decline of the industry.

The decline of the industry has been very obvious in the past year. However, some of it, if handled properly, is not unavoidable. In other words, the unemployment crisis that it has created is not unpreventable. Let's cite a few examples. (1) It is undeniable that many factories have to rely on imported raw materials for production. In principle, import of raw materials is permitted, but in fact, the application for foreign exchange is too difficult. It is said that the payment has been settled and the goods have arrived at the port, but it is still difficult to get approval, resulting in a state of being accessible yet unattainable. The local wool weaving industry is currently in this state. If it cannot be reasonably resolved, their production will inevitably have to stop. (2) Any control cannot but give considerable obstruction to the original practitioners. But if it is handled properly and the public can obtain considerable benefits, then sacrificing the small for the big is not a bad idea. It is a pity that the control is not thorough and the result is unsatisfactory, merely depriving the people of their interests, making those who have businesses unable to operate them and those who have jobs unable to do them. That would be too much of a loss. The yarn and cloth industry has been loudly crying out in recent days, demanding the lifting of the ban on domestic sales. This is a clear proof. (3) Since the ban on gold trading, the silver industry has been subject to official prices. There has been an absence of deposits and the reserves are on the verge of exhaustion. The government neither sells it at the official price, nor allows it to be traded freely. If this continues, it will inevitably have to close down completely. It is heard that in Shanghai alone, there are more than 100,000 people who directly or indirectly rely on this for a living. This is a very serious matter!

This kind of man-made unemployment panic can be seen everywhere. Some of them have been noticed by the authorities and have changed their plans, such as the ban on peddlers and the removal of human-powered rickshaws from factories. Of course, there are more than just the examples mentioned above that have not been noticed and are still in progress. We believe that it is difficult to resettle the unemployed, but it is easier to maintain those who are employed. It may not be easy to maintain those who are employed, but if we are careful in our handling and do not allow those who are employed to return to unemployment, it is not very difficult after all, and it is also something that should be worked hard to achieve. At this time, any policy or plan that does not benefit the people's livelihood and instead causes the people to lose their jobs, increasing the severity of the current situation, is considered to be an unwise move.

### Indian leaders accept partition; the new plan contains twenty-one key points; it was officially announced simultaneously in London and New Delhi yesterday

[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] Governor-General Mountbatten broadcasted to India and the world from the Governor-General's Office this morning, announcing the British government's 21-point plan to transfer power to India, suggesting the establishment of an independent Pakistani state. Prime Minister Attlee and Secretary of State for India Lord Listowel also announced the content of the plan in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in London at the same time. Moments before Governor-General's broadcast, Nehru made a statement to the domestic press, declaring that the Congress Party had accepted the plan proposed by the Governor-General, while Muslim League Chairman Jinnah announced to reporters that he had accepted the plan with some reservations.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 3rd] It was announced here that the leaders of the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee have accepted the British plan for the partition of India in principle. The leaders of the three parties will submit the resolutions of their respective executive committees last night to Governor-General Mountbatten. It is heard that the Sikhs have protested against the fact that half of the Sikh population in India is included in the Muslim partitioned state. It is heard that the plan put forward by Britain yesterday includes the following points:

(1) The provinces of Bengal and Punjab will implement the division of Muslims and Hindus before the end of June 1948, (2) the current central government will be replaced by two separate cabinets, (3) a new constituent assembly will be elected to draft the constitution of the Muslim partitioned state, and the existing assembly will draft the constitution of the Hindu partitioned state, (4) the fate of the Northwest Frontier Province will be decided by a public vote, (5) before the British army withdraws from India, India will be composed of two autonomous territories, which can freely withdraw from the British Commonwealth, and the princely states will form a third autonomous territory, which can maintain independence, join the Hindu partitioned state or the Muslim partitioned state. It is heard that the plan does not involve the thorny issue of the Indian army.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] It is learned that at today's meeting, the leaders stated that the partition of India, including all related matters such as diplomacy and defense, will be implemented immediately. It is expected that the existing Indian interim government will continue to exist for about two months, at which time the necessary legislation will have been passed and the work of partition will have entered a stage where the central government of Pakistan can be established.

[This newspaper] London broadcast on the 3rd: Well-informed Congress Party sources predict that there will be no major changes in India within a month. The question of how to divide the Indian areas within the Muslim provinces will be decided at this time. However, it is doubtful whether the agreement reached by the two major Indian parties on the compromise plan will end the Indian dispute from now on.

### Britain announces the return of power to the Indian people; once the legislative procedures are completed, it will grant dominion status

[This newspaper] London broadcast on the 3rd: The British government has just announced that it will return the Indian government to the Indian people as soon as possible, and that the question of whether India should be unified or divided will be decided by the Indian people themselves. At the same time, Attlee also made this statement in the House of Commons.

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 3rd] The British government announced tonight that it will immediately transfer the Indian government to the Indian people and will leave it to the Indian people to decide whether there should be one or two governments. Prime Minister Attlee spoke in the House of Commons, Governor-General Mountbatten broadcast to the Indian people, and the British government issued a white paper, all announcing this matter at the same time. The British government will submit a legislative bill to the current session of Parliament, stipulating that the Indian government will be transferred to one or two Indian governments in accordance with dominion status within this year. Whether there will be one or two governments will be decided by the Indian people.

### The new partition plan can end the struggle

From this, it can be seen that before the British are scheduled to withdraw completely in June 1948, India will be composed of one or two autonomous countries and will be affiliated with the British Commonwealth. Attlee said that the British new plan, together with the proposal to temporarily grant India dominion status, has been well received by the leaders of the Indian parties. Former Prime Minister Churchill stated that the Conservative Party supports the principle of India temporarily obtaining autonomy, but reserves the right to oppose the details of the plan. He also said that whether India becomes a unified country or is divided into Pakistan and Hindustan, he believes that "India's bloodbath is very imminent." The partition plan may give India some hope of escaping its rare and extremely terrifying tragedy (martyrdom and slaughter). The only member of parliament who opposed the Indian plan was Communist Parliamentarian Gallacher. It is said that Churchill has a poor record of his relationship with India, and his current support also raises doubts about the solution to the Indian situation.

### Establishing a Committee to Demarcate Border Lines

Attlee also stated that the representatives of the Indian National Congress, controlling various provinces, participating in the Constituent Assembly have made significant progress in drafting the Indian constitution. The Muslim League, including most representatives from Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh, as well as representatives from British Balochistan, has decided not to attend the Constituent Assembly. The proposal for partition will be implemented in these vast areas. In short, the solution to the problem of dividing the Muslim areas is as follows: all members of the legislative assemblies of Bengal and Punjab will be invited to meet in two separate groups. One group will represent areas with a majority of Muslim residents, and the other group will represent other areas of the respective provinces. If both sides do not approve of partition by a majority vote, chaos will ensue. If the decision is in favor of partition, as expected by all parties, the Governor-General will consult with leaders of major political and religious groups to establish a boundary commission. The British plan includes a provisional boundary line as an appendix.

Meanwhile, well-informed sources within the Congress Party expect that there will be few changes in India in the coming month. After that, the entire mechanism will begin partition activities to determine: (1) How many Sikh and Hindu areas in the Muslim-majority provinces of Punjab and Bengal will be carved out to form the independent Muslim state of Pakistan. (2) Which portions of the Hindu-majority states will be incorporated into Pakistan's borders. However, it remains highly questionable whether the agreement of major Indian political parties to study a compromise partition plan will end the conflict.

### Indian Monks March in Protest

Hundreds Arrested by Police

[United Press, New Delhi, 2nd] One hundred Hindu devotees held a parade today to protest against the meeting between Mountbatten and Indian leaders. They blew conch shells, carried swastika flags, and chanted Indian scriptures, leading to their detention by the authorities.

### Gandhi Advocates a Sweeper Woman as President

[United Press, London, 2nd] According to a report from New Delhi by "Exchange Telegraph," Mahatma Gandhi stated in a prayer meeting that India's first president should be a sweeper woman from the lowest class.

### Britain Assures the U.S. It Will Not Allow Indian Princely States to Secede

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Well-informed sources say: Britain has assured the United States that it will not grant dominion status to Indian princely states to prevent India from disintegrating into a three-way split. The current British plan will link them to either the Hindu or Muslim nation, maintaining the basis for division into two, and allowing them to retain all rights except for defense, transportation, and foreign affairs. American officials are now focusing on the diplomatic affairs after India is divided into two. The first U.S. ambassador to India, Grady, will take office this month, coinciding with the division of India into two countries. The general sentiment here is that a supreme representative should be temporarily appointed to handle the diplomatic work of the two Indian states. Although the United States hopes for a unified India, it will recognize the Muslim state once the division becomes a reality.

### Soviet Foreign Minister's Secretive Movements, Rumored to Have Arrived in the Yugoslav Capital, May Be Related to Organizing a Balkan Federation

[United Press, Yugoslav Capital, 3rd] According to widespread but unconfirmed reports today: A Balkan federation is about to be formed here, including Albania, while northern Macedonian Greece will also join under Yugoslav control as an autonomous state. There are also unconfirmed rumors that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has arrived here, and Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov has also set off to come. Official sources, responding to inquiries about the whereabouts of the two, said they had no knowledge, but refused to deny it immediately. The only concrete sign is a red streamlined train arriving at the capital's train station, the same type of train used by senior Soviet generals who came here last December to attend the Pan-Slavic Conference. At the same time, security around the Soviet Embassy has also been strengthened. Yugoslav President Tito and other key Balkan figures have repeatedly called for the establishment of a Balkan Federation and the Macedonian Autonomous Region in their speeches.

### Tito Speaks

Slavs Should Unite

[United Press, Yugoslav Capital, 2nd] Marshal Tito, in a recent interview with Bulgarian journalists, said: The free Balkan peoples must unite and become a strong whole. The situation in Greece, for example, is full of crisis because it cannot be unified. Therefore, for the sake of joint security, the Balkan and Slavic peoples also need to unite. Your people also have this desire, which is the same as our people's, so no one can hinder this right of ours, and we must seek its realization, including Albania. Unification does not mean aggression. Only in this way can we protect our respective independence, peace, and economic development. As for Yugoslavia's territorial claims against Austria, I think there is little hope of success, but we are a member of the United Nations, so we need to put forward this resolution. We have now signed commercial agreements with Sweden, Hungary, and Poland, and are currently negotiating with the Soviet Union, so we have obtained a guarantee to fulfill our five-year plan.

### Transferring Assets from Trieste, Yugoslavia Rejects U.S. Protest

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The State Department today ... [Note: There seems to be a printing error with missing words in the original Chinese text. I will translate as best as possible] ... previously protested to the Yugoslav government regarding Yugoslavia's transfer of valuable Italian assets from the Trieste-Ester region. The Yugoslav government responded on May 14, stating that these assets originally belonged to the Fascist party and that the United States also allowed the transfer of these assets from the American-occupied zone of Trieste, so the U.S. protest is unacceptable. The U.S. previously protested to Yugoslavia on March 27 for the Yugoslav government's transfer of industrial and worker assets from the Yugoslav military zone of Trieste without the consent of the original owners or providing legal compensation. Later, Yugoslavia arbitrarily detained nine ships damaged in the Port of Trieste. A second protest was lodged with Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government has not yet responded to the latter.

### US Halts Loan to Hungary; State Department Studies New Situation in Hungary

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: It is learned that the US government is currently considering halting the $7 million loan of raw cotton to Hungary, in order to strike at the new Hungarian government dominated by the Communist Party.

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The United States today implemented its first strike against the new Communist-controlled regime in Hungary. The State Department announced today that the U.S. government has ordered that Hungary be disallowed from continuing to draw on the $30 million U.S. surplus materials credit loan approved in February of this year. A State Department spokesman said that the State Department is considering the situation in Hungary, and the U.S. government has ordered the suspension of credit loans until developments in that country become clear. Of the $30 million loan approved by the U.S. Surplus Property Administration in February of this year, more than $15 million has not yet been used. Also, according to McDermott, a spokesman for Secretary of State Marshall, the State Department is continuing to study the situation in Hungary. McDermott declined to reveal whether the United States intends to take other actions, and he also did not know whether the $7 million approved by the Export-Import Bank for Hungary to purchase American cotton would also be suspended. Regarding the rumors that former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy will come to the United States, he said that it is still impossible to verify.

### Former Hungarian Prime Minister Refuses to Return Home for Trial

[Reuters, Budapest, 2nd] Hungarian Communist Party leader Rakosi said here today that former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, who resigned last week while on vacation in Switzerland, has refused to return home for trial. He has notified Nagy by telephone, urging him to return home for trial. Nagy resigned after the Soviet Union accused Nagy of being involved in a coup plot. Officials in London believe that developments in Hungary represent a further step in the Communist Party's seizure of power.

### New Hungarian Government to Recall Envoys Abroad

[This Newspaper] London, 3rd Broadcast: News from political circles in Hungary indicates that in the near future, the new Hungarian government will recall envoys stationed in various countries and return home for briefings.

[United Press, Hungarian Capital, 2nd] The Hungarian Cabinet is now scheduled to convene a special session of the National Assembly on June 10 to discuss the issue of elections. The Cabinet will meet beforehand on the 9th to approve the final draft of the election plan and other legislation proposed by the new Prime Minister Dinnyés. Prime Minister Dinnyés recently issued his first announcement after taking office, emphasizing Hungary's determination to live in peace with its neighbors, and said: We need to cooperate peacefully with the major powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, especially with our neighbor, the Soviet Union. In other news, the young son of former Prime Minister Nagy has arrived in Switzerland accompanied by a nurse.

### Soviet Conspiracy to Plunder Food from Small Countries

Romanian Food Supplies Constantly Shipped to the Soviet Union

[This Newspaper, Manila, 1st] The recently published "Newsweek" magazine quoted Romanian diplomats as revealing that although the famine situation in Romania is very serious, ships are still loaded with large quantities of wheat and grains from Romania and shipped to Odessa in the Soviet Union every day. Observers in Manila firmly believe that the Soviet plan aims to plunder food from small countries to enrich the Soviet Union, and to force democratic countries such as the United States and Canada to transport food to relieve famine-stricken countries.

### Soviet Interference in Hungarian Internal Affairs, Britain and the United States Will Engage in Consultations, Soviet Authorities Accuse Former Hungarian Prime Minister of Plotting a Coup

[Reuters, London, 2nd] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: The British government continues to obtain factual reports on the situation in Hungary from its political representative stationed in Budapest. The British government may consult with the U.S. government on the issue of Soviet interference in Hungary. The Soviet Union accuses former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy of participating in a coup plot. The British government is still awaiting this evidence, and cannot judge whether the Soviet authorities' accusations are valid before obtaining it. The British government has not yet taken any action to date. It is expected that Britain will, according to the agreement of the Allied Control Commission, request the Soviet authorities in Budapest to provide a report, because according to that agreement, when one of the three powers holds a report that the other two powers are interested in, it should be made public to the other two powers. When referring to the reorganization of the Hungarian government, the spokesman said that, according to the information obtained, the new government still seems to fully comply with the constitutional conditions.

### U.S. to Continue Aid to Italy, Marshall Issues Statement

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Marshall declared today, "We should continue to aid the Italian people and hope that the new government led by Gasperi will succeed in all respects. The American people have a deep and friendly interest in the welfare of Italy. We are pleased to provide some assistance to Italy's economic recovery. In the future, we should continue to provide assistance to the Italian people who sincerely believe in democratic methods to maintain individual freedom and basic human rights."

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The U.S. Senate will begin debating the ratification of peace treaties with Italy and other countries at noon on Tuesday. Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vandenberg has obtained unanimous consent from the Senate to expedite the handling of various treaties and urged their approval. Whether they can be approved by a two-thirds majority is still questionable, as most senators have not yet decided their attitude. However, the debate date will end by the end of this week or within two days. Marshall also believes that these treaties are the best compromise with the Soviet Union and said that if they are not approved, the peace treaty for Germany and Austria will encounter difficulties, so he also advocates their approval to show the goodwill of the United States in conducting peace negotiations.

### New Japanese Cabinet's Economic Policy Still Based on Four-Party Agreement, New Cabinet Starts Preparing for Various Administrative Measures

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] Although Prime Minister Katayama's three-party coalition cabinet has ceded the position of Minister of Finance to the Democratic Party, the economic plans for overcoming difficulties in the future will still be presided over by the Council of Economic Ministers, whose members are five from the Socialist Party and two from the Democratic Party. The actual production and transportation sectors are also in the hands of the Socialist Party. Prime Minister Katayama seems unwilling to shirk responsibility for overcoming Japan's economic crisis in the future, but his methods will also adopt a "middle-of-the-road" approach, and will not act arbitrarily. On the 2nd, Minister of State and Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board Hiroo Wada told reporters: "Economic policies in the future will still be based on the four-party policy agreement. Among the senior officials of the department, such as the Deputy Director-General and the Deputy Director of the Price Agency, will be selected from the private economic sector, all in order to ensure that the policies can be implemented smoothly."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] After the establishment of the Katayama Cabinet, it immediately began preparing for various administrative measures, which are described as follows: (1) The Economic Ministers' Council of the Katayama Cabinet will hold its first meeting on the 6th to discuss the basic items related to the new cabinet's administration, and its decisions will be announced as the outline of the Katayama Cabinet's administration to overcome the economic crisis. (2) The Katayama Cabinet is currently in urgent need of deciding on the candidates for parliamentary vice-ministers of various ministries, as the appointment of the chairmen of the subcommittees of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors is imminent, but it still needs to be decided at the cabinet meeting on the 5th. (3) Katayama once earnestly requested Toshiro Irie, the former Director-General of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, to stay in office, but Irie formally submitted his resignation on the 2nd. Tatsuo Sato, the former Deputy Director of the Legislation Bureau, is the most vocal candidate for the new director-general. Also, as the affairs of the current cabinet are becoming increasingly complex, it was decided at the cabinet meeting on the 3rd to increase the number of Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretaries to two. (4) Before the new cabinet convenes the Economic Ministers' Council to decide on the outline of the administrative measures to overcome the economic crisis, it will first convene the first national meeting of popularly elected prefectural governors. It is planned to decide on the food collection quota of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry at this meeting. The meeting will be convened around the 20th. (5) The new cabinet is considering reorganizing the Central Public Office Qualification Review Committee and plans to appoint Minister of Justice Suzuki as the chairman.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] On the establishment of the Ministry of Labor, which was decided at the cabinet meeting on the 3rd, a preparatory committee will be established with Minister of State Miura as the center, and preparations will be actively launched.

### Soviet Attitude Towards Finland Becomes Harsher, New Situation Brewing in Finland, Prime Minister Attaches Importance to Relations with the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Sweden, 3rd] The recent hardening of the Soviet attitude towards Finland indicates that the Soviet Union feels displeased with the possibility of a reorganization of the Finnish government. Prime Minister Pekkala, at the behest of Finnish President Paasikivi, is doing his best to maintain the unity of the coalition cabinet so that it can continue to serve. Otherwise, a general election must be held. The Finnish President believes that it is not appropriate to hold elections before the Finnish Peace Treaty and Finland's request for the Soviet Union to allow it to use the Saimaa Canal in the east and the Helsinki-Turku railway in the western Soviet-occupied zone have been approved by the Soviet Union, because the result of the general election will inevitably form a right-leaning trend, which will hinder relations with the Soviet Union. Since Pekkala's coalition cabinet resigned in April, the President has invited party leaders six times to try to form a new cabinet, but all have been unsuccessful. Therefore, the President has asked Pekkala to withdraw his resignation and try to find a new agreement between the Social Democratic Party, the People's Democratic Party, and the Agrarian League, so that the existing coalition cabinet can continue to serve until the expiration of the term of the current parliament in the summer of 1948. When the cabinet resigned, it agreed to continue to serve until a new cabinet is formed, so technically, the cabinet members have not resigned. Prime Minister Pekkala is currently seeking an understanding between the cabinet members. Recently, the People's Democratic Party and the Agrarian League have agreed, and only some reservations put forward by the Social Democratic Party have not been withdrawn.

### The Senate Assembly Closes Today, Approves Additional Municipal Construction Tax on Automobiles, Total Amount Not Exceeding 18 Billion for Autumn Collection

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Senate held its fifth meeting of the third assembly yesterday afternoon, discussing proposals related to public finance and passing bills such as levying a municipal construction tax on automobiles. As all the proposals could not be discussed according to the agenda, the session will be extended by one day. The sixth meeting will be held from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM today, and the seventh meeting from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, to continue discussing the proposals, followed by the closing session.

The discussion on the automobile municipal construction tax case yesterday caused heated debate. The case was jointly proposed by city senators and the mayor. The senators' proposal was "Proposal to Suggest the Municipal Government Increase the Municipal Construction Tax on Automobiles to Enrich Revenue Specifically for the Expense of Repairing Roads and Bridges in the City." The proposed tax rates were: 1.5 million national currency per business-use large truck per year, 1 million national currency per private-use large truck per year. 1 million national currency per business-use small car per year, 500,000 national currency per private-use small car per year. Collection will begin this summer, on a quarterly basis. The mayor's submitted proposal was: "Proposed collection of additional municipal construction tax on automobiles in the city specifically for repairing damaged roads in the city, please vote for it." The tax rates were the same as those proposed by the senators, with the addition of 200,000 per motorcycle per year. It is estimated that this would generate a total of 18 billion yuan per year (it is noted that a thorough repair of all road surfaces would require over 78 billion yuan).

As the discussion began, Qu Yue expressed his support for the case, but suggested changing the collection to semi-annual. Yan Esheng stated that he was not opposed to the tax, but the central government had stipulated that local governments should not increase taxes under any pretext in the future, and this point should be noted, otherwise, the central government and the citizens will express opposition later.

Opposition to Tax Rate Levels

Zhou Xiangsheng expressed dissatisfaction with the higher tax rate for business-use automobiles compared to private-use ones. He said that although business-use automobiles are driven on the roads for a longer time, they serve those without their own vehicles. If one has their own vehicle, they will certainly not call for a business car for travel. If the tax rate is high, the price of business-use cars will also increase, so for the sake of the general public, the tax on business-use cars should not be higher than that on private-use cars.

Li Wenjie said that although local taxes and levies cannot be increased again, the city's finances have reached a dead end. The municipal government's budget does not include funding for construction. Without increasing revenue, not only will roads be impossible to repair, but all other construction will also be unsustainable. The municipal government's original budget for road repairs was 9.6 billion yuan, which has been removed in the revised budget, resulting in no such funding in the city budget of over 200 billion. The recent additional budget from the Public Works Bureau is as high as over 60 billion yuan. There is currently no way to make up for this amount, so he advocated collecting the municipal construction tax on automobiles, but 20% of it should be used for social relief expenses.

Pang Jingzhou seconded Zhou Xiangsheng's opinion, saying that the tax on business-use vehicles should be reduced. Tang Shichang believed that the tax rate on business-use vehicles was not too high and suggested increasing the tax on private-use trucks to 1.5 million yuan per year and private-use cars to 1 million yuan, which would be equal to that of business-use vehicles. Zhang Zhihan seconded this.

Tong Hangbai rose to express fundamental opposition, believing that the Senate's proposal increases the people's burden and violates constitutional principles. Citizens have already expressed annoyance, saying that every time the Senate meets, it increases the people's burden. The Senate should not automatically propose bills; at least they should be submitted by the mayor.

Speaker Explains Two Points

Speaker Pan then explained two points: (1) This case was originally submitted by the mayor. The senators' proposal to suggest increasing the tax is indeed inappropriate and has been revised. (2) Article 70 of the Constitution states: "The Legislative Yuan may not propose to increase expenditures on budget proposals submitted by the Executive Yuan." This case is not increasing expenditures; on the contrary, it is making up for the inadequacy of expenditures.

Fei Shusheng then spoke, expressing his support for the tax, but stated that since this project cannot be completed within a year, there is no need to collect the full 18 billion. He advocated that the tax rates for business-use and private-use vehicles should be equal. The tax rate for trucks should be higher than that for cars, but the amount should not be rigidly fixed and should be determined by the municipal government, with the principle that the total amount does not exceed 18 billion yuan. Shao Yongsheng proposed changing the tax to 1 million for both private-use and business-use trucks and 500,000 for cars. As for Zhou Xiangsheng's car rental, it wouldn't matter to pay an extra two or three thousand yuan if you take it. At this time, Zhou Xiangsheng again said, "Business cars in foreign countries don't pay taxes." Qu Yue retorted, "Foreign countries can manufacture their own cars, but China cannot." (This caused laughter.)

Later, Yu Shun proposed that the tax rates for business-use and private-use vehicles should be the same, but they should be collected based on the tonnage of the vehicles, as determined by the municipal government, with the principle that the total revenue does not exceed 18 billion.

Finally, the opinions of Senators Jia Shusheng and Yu Shun were put to a vote, and the majority supported Yu Shun's opinion. Regarding the Public Works Committee's opinion that it should include traffic management fees, and Li Wenjie's proposal to allocate a portion for social relief expenses, neither were passed.

### Specifically for Repairing Roads and Bridges

The Senate Assembly resolved as follows: The case is titled: "Proposal to Levying Municipal Construction Tax on Automobiles to Enrich Revenue Specifically for the Expense of Repairing Roads and Bridges in the City." Collection target: Owners of private and business-use automobiles in the city. Tax rates and collection methods: To be determined by the municipal government. The tax rate is uniform regardless of whether the vehicle is for private or business use. However, both trucks and cars are calculated according to the vehicle license tax based on tonnage. The total revenue should not exceed 18 billion in principle. Effective date: Starting this autumn.

In addition, regarding financial cases passed, there was one regarding the Finance Bureau's land tax survey, which was deemed inaccurate and should be thoroughly corrected based on the original records. If there are errors, grain households are allowed to correct them as much as possible, and penalties will be waived.

### Expanding Scholarship Aid Campaign, Student Unrest Guidance Committee Asks for Assembly Discussion

The Student Unrest Guidance Committee of the Senate, Wang Zhengting, Zhan Wenhuan, Tao Baichuan, Ma Junshuo, Zhao Junhao, Pang Jingzhou, Huang Shijin, and others, believe that although the work of guiding student unrest has shown some effect, in order to prevent problems from arising, it is even more important to address the root causes. The most important thing is to find ways to solve the students' personal problems and improve the adverse social environment. In order to protect youth, maintain education, and prevent future disputes from arising, they specifically suggest that the Senate establish a municipal scholarship aid campaign committee to continue working from a proactive perspective in the hope of concentrating the efforts of all sectors of the city to expand the scholarship aid campaign in order to reduce future educational crises. This suggestion will be submitted to the assembly for discussion today (the 4th), it is said.

### Resolution to Abolish Exchanges Retained by Assembly

[Reported by this newspaper] The "Petition to the Central Government to Abolish All Exchanges in Shanghai, Eliminate Speculation, Stabilize People's Livelihoods, and Maintain Law and Order" proposed by City Senator Chen Gongda and others was reviewed by the Finance and Social Affairs Committees, which deemed it unnecessary to abolish them but suggested strict management and proposed seven items. When this case was brought up at the assembly yesterday, Zhang Zhihan believed that it was impossible to abolish the exchanges and that the measures set by the Senate might not be thoroughly implemented, so he advocated that the entire case be retained and not discussed. The original proposer, Chen Gongda, insisted that the exchanges should be abolished and listed the reasons for their harm. Luo Qinghua said that during the war, there were no exchanges in the rear, so did the phenomenon of hoarding and profiteering improve? He also said that he remembered that during the Provisional Senate, there was a proposal to ask the government to restore the exchanges to absorb floating capital and other matters, so he seconded Senator Zhang's opinion to retain this case. In the final vote, a majority of senators passed the retention of this case without discussion.

### Divergent Opinions on the Issue of Recovering the Old Site of the Zhongzheng Barracks, Continued Discussion Today

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu, in response to the interpellation raised at the Senate assembly the day before regarding the Land Bureau's leasing of the old site of the Zhongzheng Barracks in Cao Town, and requesting an explanation of the process, specifically reviewed the archives and sent the handling process, lease contract, and Shanghai Municipal State-Owned Real Estate Management Measures, etc., to each senator for reference yesterday. The area of the old site of the Zhongzheng Barracks is 335 mu, 4 fen, 5 li, and 8 hao. It was leased to the Jianguo Machinery and Agricultural Reclamation Company last October for planting purposes, with a stipulated lease term of ten years, and the contract was signed by Xu Enzeng, the representative of the company. However, it was stated that "one-third of the area (in the area), which is jointly designated by the Education Bureau as public land, totaling 110 mu, 4 fen, can be unconditionally recovered by Party A at any time if needed, and Party B shall not demand any compensation."

When the Senate Assembly discussed this case yesterday, some senators again rose up in opposition, demanding the cancellation of the contract. The opinions of the senators were also inconsistent, but due to lack of time, there was no result, and the discussion will continue today.

In addition, several citizens' representatives from the town, including Huang Buyi, went to the Senate yesterday to petition, requesting the municipal government to recover the land and use it to build a school district.

### Real Estate Association Petitions, Hoping to Adjust Rent Multiples

[Reported by this newspaper] There were two petitions to the Senate yesterday regarding housing issues: (1) Ten representatives of the Real Estate Association requested the Senate to adjust the rent multiples. (2) Nine residents of Gao Hou Lane on Tiantong Road, including Yong Shui, petitioned because the landlord forcibly demolished their houses, requesting justice.

### June 3rd Opium Suppression Day, Commemorative Meeting Held, Heads of Various Departments Elaborate Determination to Suppress Opium

Yesterday was "June 3rd" Opium Suppression Day. The whole city hung flags in commemoration. The commemorative meeting was held at the Municipal Stadium on Albert Road at 9:00 AM.

The ceremony was simple and solemn. The meeting began with the sound of military music, presided over by Mayor Wu, respectfully reading Sun Yat-sen's last instructions on opium suppression, and silently commemorating Lin Wenzhong for three minutes. Then, Mayor Wu, Special Envoy Liu, Commander Xuan, Speaker Pan, President Dong, and Chairman Fang successively delivered speeches elaborating on the scourge of opium and the government's determination to suppress opium. Finally, slogans were shouted until around 11:00 AM.

Two Opium Burning Locations

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, on June 3rd Opium Suppression Day, at 10:00 AM, the Police Bureau burned the opium paraphernalia confiscated from opium users over the past year in Zipu Park. Chief of the First Section Huang Dongsheng and Chief of the Health Section He Wendong presided over the burning. Representatives from the Local Court, Health Bureau, and Opium Suppression Envoy's Office also attended. When the opium was burned, the park was crowded with tourists. The remaining residue was then transported by police officers and discarded into the Huangpu River. In addition, the Local Court also held a public opium burning at the Yangji Yuan Square. The opium soil and other drugs were those received after the victory from the Puppet Local Court Prosecutor's Office and the Puppet Jiangsu Province Shanghai Local Court.

### Murder and Robbery Case of Accountant Cracked, Apprentice from Anchang Pawnshop Escorted from Jinhua to Shanghai, Most of Stolen Goods Recovered

[Reported by this newspaper] Huang Yujia, a Chaozhou native apprentice at the Anchang Pawnshop at 120 Hubei Road, used a kitchen knife to kill accountant Pan Sanquan on the evening of the 22nd of last month at 9:30 PM. He stole a yellow handbag from the vault, a Cromi cigarette case, a diamond ring, seven gemstone rings, two gold-plated pocket watches, one 18k gold watch, twelve watch rings and chicken heart pendants (weighing two liang, nine qian, four fen), twelve men's watches, three women's watches, nine pocket watches, two gold teeth, nine jade artifacts, one Parker pen, one set of coarse cloth Zhongshan suits, three gold bracelets, two earrings, twenty pure gold rings, and 85,000 yuan in legal currency. He used the alias Zhang Min and fled to Jinhua, where he was discovered by the local military police. They were about to send him to the judicial authorities when they read the newspaper and learned that the criminal was the main culprit in the murder case at the Anchang Pawnshop in Shanghai. They telegraphed the Old Gate Police Station in Shanghai, and Chief Shi of the branch office ordered Officer Song Shaomei to lead police officers Yang Junqing and others to meet and escort him back, assisted by squad leader Yang Guangyuan from the Jinhua Gendarmerie. The criminal confessed to the murder and robbery and said that on the morning of the 23rd, he took the train to Hangzhou and bought a set of blue cloth Zhongshan suits under the alias Zhang Min at a small inn on Nanxing Bridge that night. The next morning, he took the gold jewelry and other items to Jinhua, stayed at the Natural Hotel, and was found to have many gold ornaments in his room during a search by the local military police on the afternoon of the 25th, which aroused suspicion and led to his arrest. Most of the above-mentioned ornaments have been recovered, and a small number of items are still being investigated. The criminal will be handed over to the court for prosecution after recording his confession.

### As soon as the Index is Unfrozen, Disputes Arise in Two Factories, Mutual Assistance is Relied Upon During This Difficult Period, Wu Kaixian Expresses Thoughts

[Reported by this newspaper] After the announcement of the May cost of living index, most factories expressed their inability to bear it. Yesterday, when some machinery factories in the Pudong district paid wages, they were unable to bear the 23,500 times the basic wage, so they changed to paying according to 14,800 times the April index. Employees were dissatisfied with this, and two factories even had a slowdown in work because of this. The Social Bureau is sending personnel to investigate after hearing the news. According to people in the machinery industry, most of the products of various factories are orders from the past. The machinery industry is different from other industries in that the expenditure on wages exceeds the cost of raw materials. When the cost of living index was frozen, it was difficult for general manufacturers to maintain operations. Now, if they want to pay according to 23,500 times the basic wage, they are unable to bear it.

Improving Work Efficiency

Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Bureau told reporters yesterday that the capital side cannot deny the accuracy of this index, but the inability of some manufacturers to bear it is also a fact. There are now two ways to solve this: (1) Through consultation between labor and capital: (A) Negatively, the capital side invites representatives from the labor side to discuss, making accounts public to prove that the capital side is indeed unable to bear it, and discounting the index. (B) Actively, workers increase production and improve work efficiency to compensate for the capital side's expenses, or extend working hours without paying extra wages. (2) The government should be responsible for the lives of workers and should also assist manufacturers in solving difficulties. For example, legitimate manufacturers cannot obtain raw materials for production, and intermediaries manipulate them, so manufacturers have no choice but to seek them from the black market at high prices, which affects product costs.

Priority Supply of Raw Materials

In the future, the government should prioritize the direct supply of all imported raw materials to manufacturers, preventing them from falling into the hands of intermediaries and being manipulated and raising prices. In addition, it is also necessary to consider reducing unnecessary donations and taxes to reduce the burden on the capital side. In short, this problem today is not simple and needs to be solved from multiple perspectives. Otherwise, if it is not thoroughly improved, even if workers work for free without wages, the capital side will inevitably have a day when they cannot survive. Workers who understand the situation should know that it is always better to be employed than unemployed, and a low wage is always better than receiving relief. During this period of economic difficulty, labor and capital should work together in the same boat and reach an agreement to overcome the difficulties. I believe that workers will never sink the boat, causing both sides to perish together.

### Hongqiao District Beautification, Ideal Paradise

[Special Report by this newspaper] The municipal government established the Urban Planning Committee in July of last year to design and transform "Greater Shanghai," intending to divide Shanghai into twelve urban district units. More than twenty students from the Civil Engineering and Architectural Engineering departments of St. John's University, based on the above principles, conducted further research and held an urban planning exhibition at the school. In order to concentrate efforts, they first completed the design of the "Hongqiao District." They assumed that the Hongqiao District should be divided into three town units, further divided into sixty to one hundred and fifty small units. Each small unit should have a complete primary school and two to four nurseries. Other daily necessities stores, barber shops, tea rooms, small vegetable markets, etc., are all concentrated in one location, so that housewives can buy everything they need within twenty minutes. In terms of entertainment, the Hongqiao District is assumed to have sixty cinemas and entertainment centers. All open spaces are parks, sports fields, or children's playgrounds, allowing future citizens to escape coal smoke and dust and live in sunshine and greenery.

Traffic in the Hongqiao District does not require police direction, because each traffic artery is divided into fast and slow lanes on the left and right. Vehicles are not allowed to cross the road in the middle unless they reach a transfer station. In addition to being economical and practical, the residences in the Hongqiao District also pay attention to aesthetics. They assume that the fuel needed for residences is either electricity or gas, and the water supply is of course tap water. The amount of air conditioning during sleep and work is certain, and they also stipulate the angle of sunlight, using 26 degrees and 20 minutes at 10:00 AM on the winter solstice as the standard.

Most of the models are made of wood chips and gravel. Even furniture cannot be missing in the residence, with soap-carved bathtubs and cloth-covered carpets. In particular, the four "intermediate unit" planning maps are drawn with precision and detail, truly a crystallization of science and art. Here you can find an ideal paradise. I hope that the "Hongqiao District" designed by the students of St. John's University will one day be realized.

Yesterday, according to news from the shipping industry, the military representative group stationed in Japan had agreed with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to use the Sea Qian wheel to carry the overseas Chinese to Japan. However, the vessel is currently still berthed at Shantou. Therefore, the Ministry of Transport has recently ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to reassign the Sea Huang wheel to Japan.

### Trainee Accused of Cheating in Police Officer Training Class, Summoned for Questioning

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Bingdu, Xu Da, and Li Zhengbang, trainees in the Police Officer Training Class, were accused of cheating. Prosecutor Yu Yixin of the District Prosecutor's Office investigated the case yesterday. The three defendants are all members of the welfare group of the class. Last winter, the class distributed three sets of melton uniforms to each trainee. The defendants, in the name of the welfare group, fraudulently claimed the melton uniform material, sold it to merchants, and obtained a sum of about 10 million legal currency, which they divided among themselves. Later, someone reported it to the police局, which transferred it to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. During the interrogation yesterday, the defendants claimed that the money was used as a welfare group fund. Prosecutor Yu ordered the defendants to present evidence and released them on bail pending trial.

Someone accused him of being a collaborator, and the High Prosecutor's Office prosecuted him on suspicion of being a traitor.

### Sharing Bed but Having Different Dreams, Murderous Intent Arises in the Middle of the Night, Bloodbath, Love Affair Turns into Tragedy

[Reported by this newspaper] In a shack at No. 36 Hami Road, Xinqing, northwest Shanghai, at 0:30 AM yesterday morning, a bloodbath occurred in which a concubine murdered her lover. The murderer, Wang Yongfang, 41 years old, from Tianjin, committed suicide after committing the crime, suffering severe injuries. After receiving the report, the Xinqing Police Branch immediately ordered Section Chief Du Shiyan to lead Section Officer Shen Zuolian and officers Zhang Shouzheng, Zhang Yuzhen, Chen Yizhi, and Song Shiying to investigate. At that time, both were lying in a pool of blood. The victim was 42 years old, named Jiang Ada, from Taizhou. Her husband, Zhou Linzhi, died twelve years ago. Because she was not used to being lonely, she had a clandestine affair with Wang Yongfang. (Wang lives at No. 18 Le Village, Xuqiu Road, and is currently an employee of the Tiansheng Weaving Factory.) The two were initially quite fond of each other, but recently she had an affair with Sun Chuanjun, nicknamed Little Tanner. After Wang learned about this, he was extremely angry. He went to a certain iron shop on Huashan Road and bought a four-inch long arrowhead-shaped knife for 5,000 yuan and hid it. Late the night before, both Wang and Zhou had gone to bed, but at around 0:00 AM yesterday, they suddenly heard the guard dog barking wildly at the back door. Jiang hurriedly tried to put on her clothes and go out, but Wang stopped her from doing so. Then, she took out the hidden sharp knife and stabbed her twice in the left waist. Jiang was caught off guard, injured, and fell to the ground, shouting for help. Wang was afraid of being discovered and, fearing punishment, stabbed himself in the abdomen with the knife. In extreme pain, he fell to the ground. After arriving, the police officers took the two injured people to the Red Cross First Branch Hospital for treatment. Although Jiang was stabbed twice, her injuries were lighter than her lover's. The case is still under investigation.

### This Year's Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax Decided to Request Exemption from Universal Audits; The General Assembly Passed Four Resolutions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the proposal in the Senate General Assembly concerning financial matters, "In order to eliminate the recent instability factors in the city's industrial and commercial circles, it is proposed to urgently send a letter to the Municipal Government to forward a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, adopting a simplified standard collection method for the thirty-sixth year's profit-seeking enterprise income tax and exempting it from universal audits," the General Assembly unanimously passed the proposal and expressed opinions. Yan Esheng, the original proposer, first explained the crisis of the industrial and commercial circles. Luo Qinghua stated, "It is said that the profit-seeking enterprise income tax declared by the industrial and commercial circles is 60 billion, but the government's goal is 300 billion. Last year, the profit-seeking enterprise income tax declared by all sectors exceeded 50% of the profit amount. This year, in order to supplement the government's set target, it will definitely exceed four times (i.e., a profit of one million requires paying five million in profit-seeking enterprise income tax). This is in the open; if privately negotiated, the movement fee would be at least ten million. The government's move is actually destroying legitimate industry and commerce and encouraging merchants to speculate and hoard, which is a loss for the entire country and nation." Yang Guanbei also said that the current industrial and commercial circles have reached an "unbearable" point, hoping that the central government will not cause further trouble to the industrial and commercial circles.

Four Resolutions: Finally, it was passed that this association would urgently send a letter to the Municipal Government to forward a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, and also send a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce with the following four resolutions: (1) Adopt a simplified standard collection method for the city's thirty-sixth year's profit-seeking enterprise income tax, and do not conduct universal audits again. (2) Request the Direct Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance to clearly indicate the total budgeted amount for the city's thirty-sixth year's profit-seeking enterprise income tax, and then the city's direct taxation departments should, based on the tax amounts that each industry has already reported, consult with the trade associations of each industry to determine the classified standard net profit rate based on the actual business conditions of each industry in the thirty-fifth year, publicly announce it to each industry, and then fairly calculate the profit-seeking enterprise income tax amount payable by each business and merchant, as well as the excessive profit tax amount. (3) For the thirty-fifth year's business, in order to survive, it was necessary to borrow high-interest loans. At that time, it was impossible to withhold interest income tax, but now, ordering manufacturers to compensate for the payment is actually beyond their capabilities. It should be approved for exemption in order to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. (4) Before receiving the approval from the Ministry of Finance, this association should send a letter to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Direct Taxation Bureau to temporarily postpone the random audits, and the account books that have already been audited should be returned separately.

Public Proposals: Also, regarding the public proposals, the General Assembly continued to discuss them yesterday, including: (1) "Please extend the No. 11 bus route to Shanghai University to facilitate transportation." The General Assembly resolved that the Public Utilities Bureau should extend the No. 11 bus to the end of Pingliang Road after the eastern section of Pingliang Road is completed. (2) "The city's power shortage is serious, hindering production and increasing unemployment. It is proposed to send a telegram to the central government requesting that the 50,000 kilowatts of machinery taken from Japan as war reparations be reallocated to the joint electric company formed by Shanghai's various companies." Resolution: (1) Request the central government to reallocate the machinery as proposed. (2) Request the municipal government to strengthen management after the joint electric company is formed. (3) "Request the issuance of suburban tricycle licenses to unemployed workers from northern Jiangsu or other unemployed workers to maintain their livelihoods." Resolution passed. (4) "The lights in the Zhabei and Nanshi areas often go out. It is proposed to forward a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau to study improvements." Resolution. (5) "Please immediately and thoroughly eliminate all tricycle companies in the city, revoke their business licenses, so as to prevent more than 20,000 employees from being perpetually poisoned and exploited." Resolution: Send to the Public Utilities Bureau for handling. (6) "Propose that the Public Utilities Bureau order the power company to adjust the daily power outage time for textile factories in order to improve workers' health and benefit production." Resolution: Send to the Public Utilities Bureau for consideration and handling. (7) "Promote safe water supply throughout the city to prevent epidemics and protect health." Resolution: Send to the Municipal Government for handling. (8) "Propose to request the Executive Yuan again to transfer all enemy property docks and warehouses in the city to the Shanghai Municipal Government for takeover." Resolution passed. (9) "Propose to use land and water transportation agencies to collect a business fee of 100 yuan per ticket as a special fund for Pudong construction." Resolution passed. (10) "Propose that the Municipal Government order the franchise companies to restore the electrical equipment and power supply to the Longhua District, Hongqiao Town, Qibao Iron, etc., to restore the old appearance and prosper the city." Resolution: Send to the Municipal Government for handling.

Land and Water Transportation Proposed to Collect Business Fees

### Eloquent Arguments in the Debate Court; Jiang Biao's Case Set for Sentencing on the 10th; Plaintiff Demands Compensation for Losses

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Jiang Biao, Director of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, and Tan Zhaolin, Deputy Director of the Bureau's Transport Group, being accused by Liu Qintang, Chairman of the Jian Guo Industrial Company, of seizing vehicles and obstructing freedom, was concluded in the Criminal Court No. 3 of the District Court yesterday morning by Judge Ye Guiling, and the sentencing was scheduled for the morning of the 10th. In yesterday's oral debate hearing, in addition to the plaintiff Liu Qintang and the defendants Jiang Biao and Tan Zhaolin, witnesses Chen Junhao, Wang Yingbin, Gong Wenguo, and Lu Qixiang also appeared in court to testify. Zhu Bing, General Manager of Xin Sui Company, did not attend. First, the defendant's defense lawyer, Fang Fushu, presented a large advertisement published in the newspaper on the 2nd of this month, "Liu Qintang's Urgent Announcement," stating that such behavior was inappropriate while the case was being heard in court. Subsequently, during the trial, the arguments between the plaintiff and the defendant were extremely fierce. Jiang claimed: He is a national administrative official and has the right to recover vehicles. If he is sued by a businessman for performing his duties and brought to court, where is the dignity of the nation? Liu claimed: Government officials are public servants of the people and serve the people. If there is an act of obstructing freedom, a lawsuit can naturally be filed. When questioned, the second defendant, Tan Zhaolin, claimed: The recovery of vehicles was not carried out by force. He went to recover the vehicles with the staff of Xin Sui Company and provided receipts. After the witnesses were questioned one by one, the court ordered the conclusion of the debate in this case and set a date for sentencing. Yesterday, the plaintiff also filed a civil lawsuit, demanding compensation for losses from the defendant: (1) Compensation for 26 Dodge five-ton trucks; (2) Compensation for driver salaries, travel, food, and lodging expenses at a monthly rate of 3.11 million yuan in legal tender from February 1 of this year to the end of the execution date, and 5% statutory interest per year; (3) Compensation for losses due to the increase in railway freight costs of 143 million yuan; (4) Compensation for business losses of 3.97 million yuan in legal tender per day, and 5% statutory interest per year. And please allow a declaration of execution.

### Forcible Eviction Results in Murder of Tenant

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Youfa, 29 years old, from Linping, sells chickens for a living and lives at No. 38 Yinjiagang, Tu San Street, Xujiahui. At around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, while he and his wife, Yu, were having dinner, Shen Shaobiao (nickname Ah Mang), the second landlord who was sweeping garbage, suddenly came to force Xu Youfa to move unconditionally.

### The Expedition Team's Efforts Fall Short, the China United Team Avenges Their Previous Loss with a One-Point Victory; Score at Halftime is 42 to 40, 19 to 17; Minister Bai Attends to Watch the Game and Present Awards

[Report from Our Newspaper] The great battle between the China United and Expedition teams took place at the Municipal Gymnasium starting at 7:15 PM last night. The audience was ecstatic, with over 5,000 people in attendance. Minister Bai Chongxi arrived to present awards. In the end, China United defeated the Expedition team by one point, 42 to 40, avenging their previous defeat. The halftime score was 19 to 17 in favor of China United. The second half was a bloody battle, with each team scoring 23 points.

The second half of the game was the most intense. When the score was tied at 35, the Expedition team's Jin Tuyu missed three free throws, which had a serious impact. Wu Chengzhang of China United was the most active player. Although Liu Fushan did not finish the game, Li Zhenzhong and Kong Guangyi were clear-headed. Veteran Quan Changchun performed well. The team relied entirely on experience to win last night. The three musketeers of the Expedition team, Yu Ruizhang, Cai Zhongqiang, and Tu Wenlong, charged into battle, while Liu Wang sat in the center to provide support. The failure was due to the inability to build momentum at the beginning of the game. The situation was dangerous in the first ten minutes. In the first half, China United took a two-point lead, but in the second half's do-or-die battle, the Expedition team had hopes of turning the tide. Last night, the team had bad luck with free throws, which was a major reason for the Expedition team's defeat.

China United Takes the Lead

Yesterday, after taking photos at 6:45 PM, people came to the game and took a group photo with the two teams. China United played with a new lineup last night, with Liu Fushan and Wu Chengzhang as the two forwards, Li Zhenzhong in the center, and Zhang Liangxiong and Kong Duyi as the defenders. The Expedition team still started with the five tigers: Yu Ruizhang, Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, and Wang Binghuan. The referees were Wu Zibin and Yang Liecheng. When the whistle blew, the fierce battle began. Yu Ruizhang of the Expedition team committed a foul, and Liu Fushan scored on consecutive free throws. Cai Zhongqiang responded with one point. Wu Chengzhang made a stunning move, adding three points from free throws. When Fushan committed a foul, Ruizhang scored. When Fushan scored again, it became 6 to 2. The audience cheered for the visiting team, which is a special phenomenon among Shanghai fans, who always cheer for the visiting team. Both sides committed fouls, Fushan made his shot while Ruizhang missed. China United called a timeout at 7 to 2. Zhenzhong added a handkerchief to his forehead and resumed the battle.

Two Points Apart

Zhang Liangxiong scored from a distance. The Expedition team relied on Yu's free throws to score one point, making it 9 to 3. The Expedition team relied entirely on free throws to score. Yu Ruizhang intercepted the ball, jumped up, and threw it in. In an instant, Chengzhang scored from a free throw, and Liangxiong also added three points, making it 13 to 6. The game was close, with back-and-forth action. The old Yu made a return, and China United had good luck, making every free throw. Kong Guangyi made China United's eighth free throw, making it 14 to 9. Liu Fushan "graduated" with five fouls and was replaced by Zhang Banglun. Tu Wenlong scored two free throws in a row, and China United also got two free throws. Tu and Cai made their shots, and the Expedition team fiercely chased, making it 17 to 16. Chengzhang scored two free throws, and Wang Binghuan of the opposing team also opened his record with a free throw. The halftime score was 19 to 17, with China United leading by only two points. At this time, the foul records of the two teams were as follows: Expedition team: Yu 4, Cai 2, Tu 1, Liu 2, Wang 1; China United: Liu Fushan, Zhenzhong 2, Liangxiong 1, Guangyi 3.

Expedition Team Takes the Lead

During the break, Minister Bai presented awards. Cai Zhongqiang of the Expedition team respectfully accepted the award, standing at attention, showing the true colors of a soldier. The silver cup was jointly presented by the gymnasium and the basketball association.

In the center jump ball, Yu Ruizhang made two quick shots with lightning speed, instantly surpassing the score to 21 to 19. Liangxiong and Chengzhang made smooth free throws, adding four points, making it 24 to 21, and the home team took the lead again. Veteran Quan Changchun of China United transferred Banglun, and Cai scored one point, still one point behind (24-23). Changchun and Chengzhang were too sharp, making it 29 to 23. The sound of "Adi! Adi!" was endless (Chengzhang's nickname). Wenlong and Da Li competed with each other (Zhenzhong opened the record). Liu Zhengjun made a wonderful pass and the old Cai lifted the ball in, which was commendable, making it 31 to 28. China United called a timeout to catch their breath.

A Bitterly Fought Tie

Da Li and Adi also responded to the attack. Old Kong scored from a distance, and Cai, Yu, and Tu fought hard to tie the score at 35. The situation changed, and the shouting shook the sky. Quan Changchun was called for fouls twice in a row. The first time was difficult to judge. Cai, Tu, and Yu missed three free throws, which inevitably had an impact. Chengzhang and Guangyi made their free throws, making it 38 to 35 and taking a three-point lead again (with four minutes remaining). When Changchun scored, the opposing team committed a foul, and Chengzhang broke through from the back and made another successful move.

One-Point Difference

Wenlong scored on a free throw, and Liu Zhengjun also opened his record. Cai Zhongqiang was busy but relaxed, making it 42 to 40. Yu was called out for five fouls, and Cheng Fei came to the rescue. With a one-point difference, it was uncertain who would win. China United knew that time was running out and urgently used a passing strategy to delay the game. When the bell rang, China United ended the game with a score of 42 to 40, avenging last year's defeat by one point.

China United Throw/Free Throws Fouls Points

### English Football Association Passes Amendments to Important Football Rules and Makes Recommendations to the International Football Association

[Reuters, London, 2nd] At today's annual meeting of the English Football Association, a proposal was unanimously passed to recommend to the International Football Association that in international football matches, up to two substitutes be allowed to replace injured players up to the 42nd minute.

Another recommendation from the English Football Association is to amend the rules for taking goal kicks. When taking a goal kick, all opposing attacking players must remain in the penalty area in front of the goal. The current rule is ten yards.

The meeting also passed a proposal regarding charging fouls. If a player is charged when the ball is not within kicking distance and the player is clearly not in the act of kicking the ball, a non-direct free kick should be awarded. The current rule is that outside the penalty area, this type of foul is penalized with a direct free kick, and inside the penalty area, a penalty kick is awarded.

At the same time, the meeting discussed possible football matches between England and France, Italy, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.

### Table Tennis League: The Fourth Division's Great Battle; Lu Team Defeats Siming Jia Team; The Green Team's Future Shows a Glimmer of Hope

In the second Shanghai Table Tennis League, the two strong teams of the Fourth Division, Siming Jia Team and the Lu Team, met at the Postal Service Gym at 8:00 PM the night before last. Siming Jia Team was the runner-up in the Bank Cup and has been reporting victories frequently since participating in this year's league. It, along with the seeded postal team of the division, led the pack with a great record of seven wins and seven losses. The Lu Team gathered strong players such as the Guangdong Evening Glow White Team to form a team, with substantial strength. Unfortunately, they were defeated by Jingyi due to underestimating the enemy in the previous game, which almost jeopardized their hopes of winning the championship. Therefore, all the players were very diligent in the game the night before last, and their luck was also good. In addition, Dai Yixing's comeback victory and Chen Yilong's easy victory over the opponent's all-around veteran Gui Weimin laid the foundation for victory. Siming Jia Team only had six players participating, and although their main players Wu Jianquan and Li Xidi won, it was of no help. As a result, the Lu Team defeated the Siming Jia Team with a score of five to two, which was tantamount to a resurrection, presenting a glimmer of hope for the future.

Two more games will continue tonight. The seeded Hualian team of the Second Division will play against the Orchestra team at the Jingfen Gym. Although the Orchestra team is a new team, their repeated performances have been quite encouraging. In the previous game against Taishan, they lost once when they could have won, which affected their future. Today, they will definitely fight with the determination to break the boat and seek victory. Hualian has good players such as the chopper Li Zhen, Pan Rixi, Zhong Zhihui, and the looper Lu Wenliang and Li Zaichun. When they take the field, they will definitely give the Orchestra team a serious blow. The results of the game the night before last are recorded as follows:

(Lu Team) (Siming Jia Team) (Score)

Dai Yixing Shen Xueru 3-2

Li Piran Li Xiji 1-3

Qin Duyan Yuan Shangyou 3-2

Chen Yinzhou Zhao Runken 3-1

Chen Yilong Gui Weimin 3-0

### Field Experience and Psychological Changes: An Analysis of the Expedition Team's Failure; Wu Chengzhang is a Contributor to the China United Team

Last night, China United played against the Expedition team with a reduced team. Their strength was discounted. In terms of personnel, the prediction published in this newspaper yesterday was not accurate; however, the strategy was as this newspaper predicted.

All of Shanghai has long awaited the great battle between the Expedition team and China United. Four members of the China United team, Chen Xuechong, Bao Songyuan, Ren Xiangcheng, and Zhuo Guorong, suddenly announced their departure. It is not necessary to comment on this matter before the inside story is fully understood. However, China United temporarily used a broken lineup and struggled to fight. This sporting spirit is worthy of praise.

At the beginning of the game, with the help of Fushan, China United once led by ten to five. Later, Fushan committed four fouls and his psychology changed. Yu Ruizhang took the opportunity to become active. After Fushan was fouled out, Zhang Banglun and Quan Changchun were substituted in, and China United fell into a difficult battle.

Analyzing the reasons for China United's victory in yesterday's game, the first was their dominance in rebounding, and the second should be attributed to experience and psychological state. In an emergency and heated game, the psychological state is also a major condition for victory.

In terms of individual performance, Wu Chengzhang was the best player of the game, with steals, interceptions, shots, and full-court running, he can be called an all-around player. Yu Ruizhang's steady shooting was the more outstanding one of the Expedition team. Quan Changchun was originally a member of the old China United team and was as brave as ever. After Fushan left the court yesterday, if Quan had not been substituted in, China United would not have been able to form a team. Banglun was brave but unwise and not worth reusing. (Chang Nian)

### Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, Discusses the Tasks of the Food Allocation Committee: Committee Members Too Busy to Attend, Establishment Postponed Again

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing. Yesterday afternoon at 4 pm, he met with reporters from various newspapers in the meeting room of the Bureau. Wu stated that the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Food Allocation Committee was originally planned to coincide with his return to Shanghai, but because it coincides with the session of the Municipal Council, some committee members do not have time, so the establishment must be postponed again.

The committee is composed of seven units: the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the China Trust Bureau, the Ministry of Food, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Council, and the General Labor Union. Wu himself will serve as the chairman, and there will be three standing committee members: Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Municipal Government's Department of Civil Affairs, Ren Xianqun from the China Trust Bureau, and Counselor Ye from the Ministry of Food. The selections for the other units are currently being consulted, with Luo Qinghua possibly representing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Xu Jiguan representing the Municipal Council, and Shui Xiangyun representing the General Labor Union. The address of the committee will be at the Shandong Native Place Association, and they are currently busy arranging it. There will be three sections: registration, allocation, and investigation, requiring approximately 80 personnel or more, with a projected monthly expenditure of 50 million yuan.

Before the Food Allocation Committee is established, all affairs will be handled by the Food Section, which has already approved the allocation of rice to some factories, approximately 20,000 piculs, which will be issued within the week. The plan for the establishment of the committee is to proceed gradually, so as to implement household rice allocation in August, with the following population sizes: In May and June, the number of students and workers allocated rice is 1.5 million, with a fixed quota of 2 dou [peck] of rice per person per month; in July, the number of people is expanded to 2.5 million, with the allocation quota maintained at the original amount; in August, the number of people is increased to 3.5 million, with rice allocated per capita at 1 dou per person.

Labor-Capital Disputes

Wu then offered his opinion on labor-capital disputes in the city, saying: The city's industrial and commercial situation is very difficult, and labor-capital cooperation is essential. Passively, the capital side should disclose accounts, obtain the understanding of the labor side, and rationally reduce wages. Actively, the labor side should improve efficiency to increase production. On the government side, Wu hoped that in the future, the Materials Control Committee could directly hand over imported materials to the various industrial guilds to avoid exploitation by intermediaries.

### Affected by Tight Credit, Yarn and Cloth Prices Decline; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Drops by 700,000 Yuan

Yesterday, although there was positive news in the yarn market about the Textile Control Committee suspending the allocation of cotton yarn numbers, the market's credit was tight, and purchasing power from all sides was weak. On the contrary, there was resale in the market, and the market fell. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn finally fell to 12.75 million yuan, a drop of 700,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was 8.3 million yuan, a drop of 500,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn also fell by 400,000 yuan, but 16-count coarse yarn was relatively firm.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened in the morning amid rumors that the Textile Control Committee would suspend the allocation of cotton yarn, and the market rallied, with another wave of buying. The Jiangxi [province] syndicate was active in fine cloth, and 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose from 323,000 yuan to a high of 330,000 yuan and was still difficult to find. All cloth prices were quite profitable. Unexpectedly, at the close, due to tight credit, the selling wind turned fierce. Neng Tou fine cloth also returned to 318,000 yuan, still lacking a buyer, but down 5,000 yuan from the previous day. Five Fortunes fine cloth was 296,000 yuan, down 7,000 yuan. The other grades of fine cloth all fell by 4-5,000 yuan. As for the prices of bleached cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, and serge, there were ups and downs. Dyed cloth, poplin, and blue cloth, such as 190 khaki cloth, all rose by 4-5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, depending on the quality.

### Rice Market Sees Buying Interest as Prices Gradually Rise

[Report from our newspaper] The rice market continued to thrive. After opening yesterday, due to the firm footing of all goods and exciting news, both large and small appetites were good, and trading was active, with buying interest turning strong.

Market arrivals were registered as 4,291 piculs and 9 dou [pecks] in the South Market and 3,434 piculs and 5 dou in the North Market.

Yangxian [rice] was 380,000 yuan to 382,000 yuan, White One was 430,000 yuan, and Yin Yuan was 420,000 yuan.

### New Wheat Arrives, Flour Market Weakens

Due to the arrival of new wheat, flour digestion was sluggish, and the market weakened by 1-2,000 yuan. Bran continued to decline, falling another 1-2,000 yuan. Soybean cake selling was very strong, gradually decreasing by 2-3,000 yuan. Yingkou cake continued to fall by 3-4,000 yuan. Soybean supply and demand were balanced, and the market trended toward a stalemate. Mung bean digestion was stagnant, and prices were weak. Red bean digestion was extremely rare, with slightly better movement for high-quality goods, while medium and lower quality goods still lacked transactions. Sorghum sales were still acceptable, rising by 1-2,000 yuan. Corn from Qingdao continued to be purchased, rising steadily, continuing to increase by 5-6,000 yuan. Raw peanuts loosened, falling by 5-6,000 yuan. Sesame seed prices increased sharply, with high-quality goods digesting well and rising slowly, continuing to rise by 10,000 yuan. However, medium and lower grades still lacked appeal and vitality. New broad beans from Zhejiang Province and along the Yangtze River arrived in large quantities, and digestion was stagnant, falling sharply by 1-20,000 yuan, and still lacking buyers. White broad beans from Wuhu have also arrived in Shanghai.

The first sight of new wheat came from the Nanjing-Shanghai line, transported from Longtan with high capital. Wheat from Xia Shu also arrived in Shanghai, and new wheat from Mingguang Niaoyi on the Tianjin-Pukou line will soon arrive in Shanghai, purchased by the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills at 90% of its value.

The oil market was overwhelmed with arrivals, and consumption was slack. Raw oil, soybean oil, and clear oil all fell by 10,000 yuan. However, small cart sesame oil had slightly more consumption due to the hot weather, rising sharply by 2-30,000 yuan.

### Cloth Factories in Five Counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces to Begin Receiving Yarn Allocation This Month

[Report from our newspaper] Representatives of cloth factories in Wujin, Wuxi, Wuxian, Jiangyin, and Changshu, including Cha Bingchu, Wang Derun, Wu Zhenshan, Zhu Yaocheng, and Xu Zhibin, went to the China Textile Construction Company yesterday at noon to petition. They were met by Wu Weijing, the Deputy General Manager. After the representatives stated their intentions, they presented several requests (detailed in the advertisement published in yesterday's newspapers addressed to all sectors of society), requesting allocation and sale in the same way as Shanghai. Deputy General Manager Wu immediately stated that all the points raised were factual, and he expressed deep sympathy. He agreed to allocate and sell in accordance with the regulations in each county where the procedures were complete and instructed them to contact the business office directly. The representatives immediately left to contact the business office to handle the procedures. Deputy Director Jiang and Section Chief Sun received them separately and examined the files. For the five counties, the registration certificates were complete, and it was agreed that the registration cards would be sent to the joint offices of the five counties in Shanghai that day for distribution to each county, allowing them to begin receiving the allocation this month.

### Overdue Yarn Collection

The Shipping Yarn Factory Should Issue a Certificate

The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city stated that the Textile Control Committee stipulates that each manufacturer must collect the cotton yarn purchased within 15 days. Because sometimes private yarn factories have no goods to deliver, resulting in exceeding the prescribed deadline. They requested instructions from the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on how to handle this. It is now known that the industry association has recently received a reply from the Textile Control Committee, stating that if the customer's collection deadline is indeed delayed due to the shipping yarn factory lacking spot goods, they can directly contact the shipping yarn factory to issue a certificate and indicate the possible shipping date on the stack slip and report it to the agency office of the China Textile Construction Company for reference.

### Ecuador Has Agreed to Ship 10,000 Tons of Rice to China

The national banks and bureaus have consecutively withdrawn large amounts of money in the past two days, with a withdrawal of 38.5 billion yuan on the 2nd and another 24 billion yuan on the 3rd. It is heard that among the clearing houses after number 50 in the city's bill exchange, more than ten have felt particularly strained in terms of cash management recently.

### The Preparatory Committee for Industrial Affairs Under Japanese Reparations Holds its Fourth Meeting

[Report from our newspaper] The Preparatory Committee for Industrial Affairs for Private Factories for Japanese Reparations held its fourth meeting at the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. A total of 24 representatives from the Shanghai Branch of the Industry Association, the Jiangsu Branch, and the National Federation of Commerce attended. The following resolutions were passed:

(1) Appointment of the convener of the four factory representatives: Internal Combustion Engine Factory - Zhi Yuan, Electrical Equipment Factory - Hu Xi, Steel Ball Bearing Factory - Zhou Jinshui, Hardware and Tools Factory - Yu Mingyu. (2) Each convener will invite the preparatory representatives of their factory to hold a meeting to discuss and actively promote the preparatory work, and report the preparatory situation to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office within one week.

### Jianghai Bank Suspends Operations for Liquidation: Three Branches in Nanjing, Chongqing, and Hangzhou Unaffected

[Report from our newspaper] The Jianghai Bank at 190 Ningbo Road in this city announced the suspension of operations for liquidation yesterday morning. The bank's clearing results at the bill exchange the other day showed an outstanding deficit of 900 million yuan. It ultimately failed to make up the balance. As a result, the bill exchange notified all clearing houses yesterday morning to suspend the bank's clearing. It is rumored that the bank's debts reached as much as 5 billion yuan. However, a person in charge of the bank told the reporter: There are two reasons for the bank's suspension: (1) The losses from the takeover during the bank's recent reorganization were too large, and the new shareholders lacked sufficient funds to make up for them. (2) The bank had to bear approximately 1.5 billion yuan in funds for the case of Danbao [Guaranty] Chuang Construction Factory contracting to repair the Dajie Airport construction project. After these two major blows, coupled with the recent tight cash and continuous withdrawals, it was forced to close down. According to reports, the bank was founded in March 1934 by Zhang Qinbo and others. The head office was initially located in Shanghai, and later branches were established in Hangzhou, Chongqing, Nanjing, and other places. A branch was also established on Minhang Road in this city. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the head office moved to Chongqing, and the Shanghai branch was reorganized. After the victory, it was approved to resume operations and opened on November 24, 1945. On April 5th of this year, the bank was reorganized, with Yu Luren serving as the general manager and manager. At the time of the reorganization, the capital was 100 million yuan. It is said that no chairman has been appointed since the reorganization. Currently, the bank's deposits are approximately 1 billion yuan, and loans are not many, so the difference between deposits and debts is not significant. The bank stated that it will handle the liquidation clearly in the short term. As for the bank's three branches in Nanjing, Chongqing, and Hangzhou, they will not be affected for the time being.

### Silk Factories Have No Intention to Absorb, Artificial Silk Continues to Decline: Factory Jing [Scrap] Trading is Quiet, Market is Weak

Yesterday, the artificial silk market continued to decline because the China Trust Bureau remitted payment for goods allocation again yesterday, and the silk factory syndicate had no intention of absorbing them. Furthermore, because credit was extremely tight, there were many who depreciated prices to seek to get rid of the goods, causing the market to decline as soon as it opened. 120-count Gao Shan Yuguang first asked for 18.4 million yuan and continued to decline. The closing price at noon was 18 million yuan. In the afternoon, after the same industry had their cash balanced, they all sold at low prices, raising the asking price from 8.3 million yuan to 500,000 yuan at the end. The result was still 800,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Tianqiao and others followed suit. 75-count Golden Rooster semi-gloss also asked for 500,000 yuan less.

Yesterday, the scrap [factory scrap] market was also quiet due to tight credit, and the market was weak. The silk factory syndicate offered a C-grade batch of 10 dan [a unit of weight] to the China Silk Corporation at a price of 26 million yuan. The market opened trading with a D-grade batch of 5 dan at a price of 25 million yuan, a drop of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Mid-grade batches were offered at 4 million yuan, and dry batches were negotiated at 18 million yuan, also about 500,000 yuan less than the previous day.

Yesterday, silk goods also fell along with the raw material prices. Dacheng bedding was asking 9.2 million yuan, 400,000 yuan less than the previous day. Checkered crepe opened trading at 34,800 yuan and closed at 4,600 yuan, a drop of 1,400 yuan compared to the previous day. Hua Jin crepe and feather yarn were down 1,000 yuan per yard, and Yuanli spinning and others were weak, and transactions were very rare.

### Silk Weaving Industry Meets to Discuss Relief Measures

[Report from our newspaper] Because the silk weaving industry colleagues were greatly alarmed by the sharp increase in wages after the announcement of the lifting of the cost of living index, the current market price of silk goods is far from the cost calculation. If wages are paid according to the index, the entire industry in Shanghai is bound to go bankrupt in the short term. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, a group leader meeting was convened in the industry association to discuss relief measures.

### Su, Zhejiang, and Lan Banks Estimate a Harvest of Over 200,000 Dan of Cocoons

According to the Cocoon Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Economics, the cocoon harvest situation was announced yesterday. Zhejiang Province has harvested 80,000 dan of fresh cocoons, and it is estimated that another 20,000 dan can be harvested. All cocoon banks in Jiangsu Province opened scales yesterday. Among them, Wujiang, Wuxian, Liyang, and Yixing opened scales earlier. According to the original planned cocoon collection quota, most have been received. The total province is expected to reach 110,000 dan of fresh cocoons. Judging from the observation of the cocoon production and collection situation in various parts of the two provinces, it will inevitably exceed the estimated amount. Cocoon collection companies in various places have requested an increase in loan quotas, and it is heard that the National Bank authorities are considering finding ways to raise funds.

### Bill Exchange Amount

[Report from our newspaper] According to the Auditing Office of the Central Bank, statistics on the exchange of bills at the Shanghai Bill Exchange from May 26th to 31st showed that the total number of exchanged bills was 713,897, the total amount of exchanged money was 605,598,897 yuan, and the total exchange difference was 55,525,150 yuan. Also, during the same period, the number of returned bills was 21,336, and the amount of returned money was 105,405,075,571.17 yuan.

### Deadline for Silk Loan Manufacturers to Sign Contracts was Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] The Cocoon and Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Economics stipulated that manufacturers approved for loans must pay the deposit and sign the loan contract. Yesterday was the deadline. Statistics show that a total of 70 companies have signed contracts with the Farmers Bank of China, with only one company not signing. Also, as of yesterday, the total amount of cocoon collection loans actually remitted by the Farmers Bank of China reached 202,833,771,100 yuan.

### Cigarette Market Continues to Weaken

Yesterday, the cigarette market was even weaker. It was announced that Nanyang Tobacco Company opened sales of "Da Yinhang [Great Bank]·Golden Dragon" cigarettes, and Yongtaihe Tobacco Company's June sales also began. Spot chips are abundant, the same industry's cash position is tight, consumers are quiet, and the frequency of multilateral sales is increasing, so the overall market has plummeted. From the morning opening to the end, British American Tobacco fell all the way down, to as little as 6.74 million yuan per carton, down 210,000 yuan from the previous day. Lao Dao [Old Knife] also fell to 5.77 million yuan, down 130,000 yuan. Wuhua fell by 110,000, Hardeman fell by 270,000, and all the other Da Meili [Great Beauty], Qianmen [Front Gate], and 20-pack strip cigarettes fell, especially the "Da Nanwei Da Sanpao [Great South Great Cannon]" brands, which fell sharply by more than 40,000 yuan per strip. The can of incense [mosquito coils] market was also sluggish, falling by 2-3,000 to 5,000 yuan per can.

### A Glimpse of the International Conference Venue in Geneva

— Special Dispatch from Geneva, May 10th, by Zhuang Huan

Modern Switzerland has consistently constructed its material and spiritual culture under a political system of peace and democracy. During the Second World War, this small federation of twenty-two cantons was able to maintain its neutrality, although taxes were increased and the standard of living rose, it did not suffer destruction. Currently, the Swiss franc is the leading currency in Europe. Although the US dollar is popular everywhere, it must bow its head in Switzerland. The official exchange rate is 4.25 Swiss francs per US dollar, while the black market rate is only 3.3 to 3.6 Swiss francs. When the United States and Britain wanted to manufacture watches in their own countries, the Swiss government prohibited the export of watchmaking machinery and skilled workers, leaving the US and Britain with no choice but to come to Switzerland to buy watches. At the same time, Switzerland's hydraulic machinery, machine tools, scientific instruments, etc., also occupy an important position in the world's engineering and scientific fields. Unfortunately, it lacks raw materials. Steel, fuel, and other materials all rely on neighboring countries. What it can be proud of is that its hydropower is fully utilized, ensuring an ample supply of electricity.

Everyone Produces, Exceeding Consumption Needs

Currently, Switzerland's wartime business tax of four percent has not yet been abolished. Any purchased item is subject to this tax. If employing servants at home, an additional 20% of their wages must be paid to the government as tax, and only Swiss citizens can be employed as laborers. It is said that the general standard of living is twice as high as before the war. Wages have increased by about 30% to 40% compared to pre-war levels. Whether in cities or towns, the roads are tidy and clean, and the people are healthy and happy. The population of Switzerland is only four million, less than that of Shanghai alone, but it has its own government, its own army—a conscription system, with a standing army of 500,000 people nationwide, serving three weeks a year after retirement. Its roads and houses are beyond comparison to those of China. Every Swiss person is engaged in production, and their production exceeds their consumption needs. In China, there are few who produce and many who consume. The Swiss have a high level of knowledge, a strong sense of public morality, automatically abide by national laws, collectively protect public property, and strive to fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, most families do not have servants, and there are few employees in hotels. Each person performs several tasks. Elevators are operated by hotel guests themselves, and bus drivers also sell tickets. There is only one ticket seller on trams, no ticket inspectors on trains, and it is rare to see police officers on the streets. Tax officials are also exceptionally rare.

Democratic Society, Happiness for the Majority

In China, the more we try to prevent abuses, the more abuses there are. Smuggling has become an open secret. The government establishes layers of officials, primarily to govern the officials themselves, rather than to serve the people. As a result, administrative efficiency is low, actions are slow, it is difficult to promote benefits, and even more difficult to eliminate abuses, resulting in a stalemate. The reporter believes that China's urgent tasks are:

(1) Increase Productivity: Eliminate all factors that hinder production, such as unreasonable laws, orders, tax systems, and social concepts that encourage idleness.

(2) Promote Moral Education: Educate the people through schools and society to respect personal integrity and despise lawbreakers, while encouraging society to expose those who violate the law and reason.

The essence of a democratic society lies in enabling the majority to elect a small number of representatives to lead the government, and also in enabling the majority to monitor the small number of people who commit wrongdoing. The Chinese people are accustomed to looking up to benevolent rulers and wise ministers who provide facilities that do not disturb the people in an autocratic system, considering it a blessing and virtuous governance, without knowing how to rise up and correct the evil deeds of officials. They also value personal relationships, emphasizing emotions and disregarding legal principles. Without actively promoting moral character and only passively preventing abuses, no achievement can be made. Politics is the politics of the people, and the government guides the people to move towards the path of happiness, prosperity, and strength for the majority. Therefore, the government has an even greater responsibility. As constitutional governance is about to begin, have our people deeply considered this when voting in elections?

The City's History Shines With Limitless Glory

The history of Geneva can be traced back to 58 BC. Julius Caesar of the Roman Empire stationed here when conquering Gaul. There are many monuments in the city commemorating the struggle for freedom and independence. Religious reformers John Calvin and his disciples John Knox, Guillaume Farel, and Theodore Beza launched their reform movement in St. Peter's Cathedral here. In 1814, it formally joined the Swiss Confederation. After the war, Woodrow Wilson established the League of Nations here. The International Red Cross, the International Children's Relief Fund, and the International Labor Office were all established in this country.

Snowy Mountains and Lake Scenery: An Ideal Venue for International Conferences

Geneva is situated beside Lake Geneva, at the bottom of a pocket-shaped region, bordered by France on three sides and connected to other parts of Switzerland on one side. The lake is 375 meters deep and serves as a reservoir for the Rhone River and its tributaries in Switzerland. The hydroelectric power stations downstream in Switzerland and France rely on this lake. The surrounding snow-capped mountains are reflected in the lake. The architecture and gardens are well-maintained and beautiful. Choosing this place as a venue for international conferences is indeed a good choice. During the war, due to the blockade, there were few tourists in Switzerland, causing many tourism businesses to fail and change their operations. Now, there are many gatherings and many tourists, causing some workers to be unable to find accommodation. The city has a population of 135,000, making it the third-largest city in Switzerland. Although its area is smaller than that of a county town in China, no county in China can have such infrastructure.

Coal Industry Conference: China Did Not Send a Representative

Currently, the international conferences being held in Geneva include the Red Cross Conference (which has already closed), the International Passport Conference (which has already closed), the second preparatory meeting for the International Trade and Employment Conference, and the Coal Industry Experts Conference of the International Labor Office. The upcoming conferences include the Inland Transport Experts Conference of the International Labor Office and the 30th International Labor Conference (in mid-June). China did not send a representative to the Coal Industry Experts Conference, which was criticized because China is a coal-producing country, yet its representative was absent. The preparatory meeting for the International Trade and Employment Conference is a meeting to discuss the two major topics of the multilateral international tariff agreement and the International Trade Charter. This is highly relevant to China's import and export trade and tariffs. However, the formal delegation sent by China consists of seven representatives, four consultants (one of whom did not attend), plus personnel transferred from various embassies in Europe, totaling only eighteen people (including two foreign female secretaries). There are very few who have expertise in tariffs and commodities, which is concerning. Here is a comparison of the number of representatives from various countries:

Tokyo Street Scene Today (Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Japan, Fu Junyi)

Comparative Table of Delegates from Various Countries

[Country] [Number of Delegates] [Notes]

United States 130

Australia 64

United Kingdom 112 (Plus 42 personal cars, 42 female drivers)

Belgium, Luxembourg 34 Netherlands 42 (Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, combined into one group after the meeting.)

China 18 (Including one consultant who did not attend, two foreign secretaries.)

Brazil 23

Canada 30

Cuba 29

Chile 7

Czechoslovakia 28

India 22

Lebanon and Syria 7

New Zealand 25

South Africa 22

Norway 13

Representatives and Consultants Paying Living Expenses in Advance

From the above lineup and environment, it is already clear that China is at a disadvantage. The delegation's budget is very small, and some of the transferred personnel have requested to return to their original positions due to the unsettled transfer allowances. During the opening period, representatives, consultants, and staff had to pay their own living expenses in advance. Therefore, telegrams are naturally not sent frequently, and social engagements are out of the question. It is said that this phenomenon has occurred in previous international conferences. Isn't this putting the representatives in a difficult position? In fact, the government should not delay in situations where it is necessary to compete for advantage and prestige internationally. To trace the real reason, it still lies in the lack of clear division of responsibilities in administration. As the saying goes, "Three monks have no water to drink." Procedures are cumbersome and efficiency is low. Returning from abroad and looking at our country, the feelings are endless!

### Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: A Resurrected Vital Artery (Part 2)

— Fast Dispatch from Hangzhou, May 29th, by Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, Huang Xing-Tian

The water source of the Double Dragon Cave comes from the Ice Kettle Cave. The pine breeze and verdant shadows at the entrance of the cave create a very peaceful atmosphere. The entrance to the cave is as small as a well, and the sound of water gurgling can be heard inside. Previously, to visit the cave, one had to tie a long rope around the waist and slide forward. In 1933, Minister Wu Chao-Shu donated funds to build stone steps and railings to make entry easier. Now, the stone steps have collapsed, the wooden railings are gone, and going down into the cave is very dangerous. Carelessness can lead to death. However, the fact that exploring the cave is like an adventure makes the experience even better. The further down the cave, the larger it becomes. Halfway down, a waterfall plunges directly from the darkness for more than ten feet, creating a spectacular sight that continues year-round. However, the cave does not store a single drop of water, which is also a strange thing. Another ten feet down is the bottom, where there are so many bats that they can be caught by hand. Timid people dare not go down. The Morning Truth Cave is two li above the Ice Kettle Cave. It is lofty and deep, like a tunnel. There is a small cave on the side, with naturally formed Buddha statues, hence the name Guanyin Cave. Going a mile deep, one reaches the Cage Pool (also known as Guanyin Well), on the stone wall is written "Stop," said to be the handwriting of Zhu Wen-Gong.

In addition to the Jinhua Cave, there are also the Lecture Hall Cave, the Arhat Cave, Lu Tian, the Academy, the Stone Chessboard, the Red Pine Palace, the Zhi Chang Temple, the Pan Spring, the Jinhua Temple, and other historical sites and scenic spots. If the county government can slightly improve and repair them and open up roads to make transportation convenient to attract tourists, then Jinhua's prosperity would have a better chance.

### The Jinhua River: A Rotten Gut: Killing People Without Knives or Guns

The Jinhua Cave is a beautiful scenic spot to enjoy, while the Jinhua River is a disastrous source of harm. The Jinhua River originates from Mount Dapan and flows through the counties of Dongyang, Yiwu, Jinhua, Yongkang, Wuyi, and Lanxi, almost flowing through the entire Fourth Administrative Region. The most deeply affected is Dongyang, so Dongyang has a local saying: "The two rivers, north and south of Dongyang, are like two rotten guts, killing people without knives or guns." According to Mr. Li Chu-Wang, the commissioner of the Fourth Administrative Region, in recent years, the riverbed has become shallower and the riverbank wider. The proper river channel no longer exists. When the water rises, it becomes a vast expanse. If it doesn't rain for ten days, there is even a lack of drinking water. The erosion of land and damage to houses by the water flow is enormous. Sometimes, an entire village is washed away in three or four years. After the establishment of the commissioner's office, surveys were conducted, and there were thirty to forty places in urgent need of repair. After Commissioner Li repeatedly lobbied, the provincial government agreed to allocate 12 million as expenses for April, and the Executive Yuan allocated 600 tons of flour. In September of last year, a construction office and a water conservancy advisory committee were established. In March of this year, the first phase of the emergency repair project was completed, benefiting more than 38,000 mu of farmland and protecting more than 200 houses. Therefore, the people, who were initially indifferent, are now very sincerely grateful to the government and are helping with the progress. Commissioner Li has taken a further step in preparing a ten-year plan to develop irrigation and shipping water conservancy. The entire region currently has 2.9 million mu of farmland. Starting this year, an additional four catties of water conservancy grain will be levied per mu, with 60% retained by the county for various water conservancy projects and 40% used for the Jinhua River water conservancy project. If this plan succeeds, ships will be able to sail smoothly on the Jinhua River. It will then become very convenient to go to the poetic Fuchun River to see Yan Ziling's fishing platform. Chairman Shen is very concerned about water conservancy projects in Zhejiang, and the achievements of the Jinhua River water conservancy project have ranked first in the province. We hope that under the active guidance of Commissioner Li, the spirit of continuous work can be maintained, and this harmful "rotten gut" can be transformed into a healthy blood vessel that benefits the body!

Prime Minister Katayama Tetsu's Speech (Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Japan, Fu Junyi)

### Beware: Japan May Invade Again

— Yu Shou-Zhong

With the US and the Soviet Union as the main players in the ongoing global struggle, the Japan issue in Asia is as important as the German issue in Europe. After the end of World War II, some observers believed that the center of the world should be in Asia in the future. The days after the 1950s will belong to the Asian century. This statement does have a theoretical basis. Of course, so far, we still believe that the center that can cause changes in the world situation is still in Europe. But imagine the power of hundreds of millions of Asians rising up one day. No one can deny its decisive influence on the overall situation of the world!

In Asia, only China, Japan, and India can be considered major powers. Some people who study the Japan issue used to think that Japan can only win, not lose; once it loses, it will be beyond redemption. However, facts have proved that Japan can indeed achieve the point of losing without collapsing this time. When Japan was on the verge of defeat, it still maintained 17 divisions of elite troops on the line from Ninagawa to Tokyo. These troops were originally prepared to reinforce the Philippines. Due to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the official participation of the Soviet Union in the war, some Japanese authorities who thought they were farsighted, and whom we should call conspirators, immediately launched a peace movement. Although they inevitably suffered opposition from some extreme factions in the army, they quickly overcame these difficulties and completed a surrender that was nominally unconditional but actually had many reservations. Today, the conservative situation in Japan, where financial magnates have replaced warlords, clearly confirms that Japan can fight again, and can still maintain itself after defeat, leaving a way out for a comeback in the future.

The foundation of these conspiracies in Japan completely relies on the point of conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. The anti-Soviet atmosphere in Japan is far beyond what the Chinese people can imagine. The conflict between the US and the Soviet Union seems not only inevitable but also likely to happen soon. The Japanese authorities deliberately emphasize this atmosphere, while on the other hand, they intentionally or unintentionally imply that as long as the US and the Soviet Union go to war, Japan can still revive. And some senior officials in the US occupation authorities, such as Colonel Jones, the chief of the Second Division (i.e., the Intelligence Division) of the Eighth Army, even openly declared that America's current enemy is no longer Japan, but the northern country. Such remarks objectively further strengthened the beliefs of Japanese ambitious individuals.

Three Million Elite Soldiers Can Be Recruited at Any Time

According to reliable information, although most of Japan's military industries have been closed or dismantled, some have not been disposed of. More importantly, although soldiers of the right age who have received rigorous training have now been discharged, Japan can still immediately recruit as many as three million elite soldiers if anything happens. (According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch on May 18, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials had inquired with the Allied countries about the idea of establishing a 100,000-strong Japanese army.) Economically, although some monopolistic enterprises, such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, have been dissolved, these dissolution plans were proposed by Japan itself and implemented with almost no modifications. In simple terms, it is just decentralization. According to a report by the New Asia News Agency in May, the Yawata Iron & Steel Works has now recovered to an annual production of 12 million tons of pig iron. This output is not much different from wartime levels, but it is much higher than in 1937. According to the data collected by our Chinese journalist group visiting Japan, Japan currently has 200 million square yards of cloth in storage, waiting for export. Artificial silk, potassium fertilizers, etc., have already been sold to countries such as Central America and South Korea with MacArthur's approval before the peace treaty was signed.

The Ideology of Aggression Has Never Been Eradicated

In addition, the most important and truly effective work of re-educating people to eradicate the ideology of aggression has never been implemented. The old ideology of aggression of the national army has not been systematically liquidated. Not only are there remnants, but almost the entire set of Greater Japanism is still intact in the minds of the Japanese people. Since the surrender, the Japanese people have hotly debated the question of why they lost the war, but almost without exception, even intellectuals blame it on Japan's science, technology, and resources being inferior to others. One rarely hears the argument that the treacherousness of the war of aggression was doomed to failure from the beginning. Conversely, they believe that as long as science and technology are developed and resources are abundant, there will be no such thing as failure. If this deep-rooted expansionist ideology is not eliminated, what can we rely on to believe that Japan will not launch another war?

But our ally, the United States, is truly meticulous in its preferential treatment of Japan. Indeed, the extent to which the Japanese people obey MacArthur is rare, and MacArthur's prestige in Japan currently seems to be above that of the Japanese Emperor. But to what extent are the Japanese people truly convinced? It seems that a little reservation should still be maintained for a nation like Japan, which has not yet been re-educated. It is true that the White House authorities created MacArthur's policy of governance; it should be seen as part of the American world policy. But on the other hand, the occupying forces live a comfortable life in Japan, are happy and do not think of returning home, and objectively help Japan speak, which is also a reason. Today, the so-called Allied Control Council is an organization with no real power. We cannot turn a blind eye to these realities. We do not want and cannot suffer another disaster from Japan. Standing from the position of the Chinese people, we must at least achieve the following points:

We Should Quickly Determine National Policy and Not Foster Trouble

(1) Demand that the government quickly determine national policy: Due to the differences in geography, history, culture, and even interests between our country and the United States, we cannot take the US policy toward Japan as our policy. We agree with the government's policy of being magnanimous towards Japan and not dwelling on old grievances, but this must have a prerequisite, which is that Japan is no longer an aggressive country. Nothing can be discussed without this prerequisite. We oppose wiping Japan off the map or out of history; but we also disagree with the method of raising tigers.

(2) Japan should not and cannot be a force for stability in East Asia: All intentional or unintentional echoes of the claim that Japan has become a stabilizing force in East Asia have the subjective and objective intention of suppressing China and obliterating China's development. We believe that only China is the only stabilizing force in East Asia. Therefore, we strongly oppose the absurd claim of industrial Japan and agricultural China. China has ample raw materials and reserves that can be used to become a modern industrial country without resorting to plunder. Regarding Japan's industrial problems, its production volume should be limited to the minimum necessary to maintain the standard of living and should never be allowed to relax the scale.

(3) Re-educate Japan: This is the most important and fundamental issue. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan's ideological education has been moving in the direction of expansion and aggression. Today, a so-called new constitution alone cannot possibly pull Japan back from the abyss of aggression. It is necessary to thoroughly implement democracy in the political, economic, and cultural aspects and eliminate all reactionary forces and their remnants. Even if this matter takes a considerable amount of time and great perseverance, the impact will not necessarily be limited to China or Asia, it may be related to the whole world.

Our Country, Which Has Fought the Longest, Should Have the Right to Speak

(4) Reparations and treaties should be based on the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration: We have fought for the longest time, and the damage is also the greatest. We should have no less right to speak on the issue of reparations and treaties than the United States. On this issue, we should try to find allies as much as possible among the countries participating in the negotiations. All those who sympathize with our claims and support our position should be contacted regardless of their origin. All suggestions and measures that are inconsistent with our interests should be opposed, regardless of which country proposes them.

Finally, according to people who have returned from Japan, people in Japan, both in and out of government, are studying the China issue no less than before the war. Regardless of their motives, even just this spirit cannot allow us to ignore or remain indifferent. How to strengthen the study of Japan, although not noticed at present, should also be an urgent task!

### Wind, Insects, and Drought: Calamity Gods Re-Assault Guangxi

— Dispatch from Guilin, May 26th, by Our Correspondent in Guilin, Liang Xiao-Zhong

At the beginning of summer, the entire Guilin lives in days of fire. A temperature of 99 degrees Fahrenheit makes people feel stuffy and hot, but touching everyone's heart, one feels a piece of ice-coldness...

At this time last year, those days of looking back on the flow of blood and tears together, quietly and with the same terrifying steps, are gradually approaching everyone, stretching out a pair of pale and terrifying hands, "Famine!" Famine is here again! During the plum rain season, the rice fields are green, how many people are bowing their heads and pulling up grass roots, how many people are silently peeling tree bark, how many people are using baskets to carry their children to the market to be sold like chickens and dogs! I cannot write out one ten-thousandth of the suffering of the disaster victims, but many people have no tears. The fire of hunger and hatred is burning in their bodies. Love, hate, kindness, resentment, people know what's in their hearts. Since March, telegrams reporting disasters from twenty-seven counties have been flying in. Wind, insects, plague, and drought all cruelly and repeatedly cover every corner of Guangxi. In an old village in Jingxi County, the number of people who starved to death reached 20 in one day. In Fengshan County, since March, the plague has almost killed all the cattle in the county. The unparalleled insect plague in central Guangxi has been so severe that the land is barren for thousands of miles, and in Lingui County, a stone's throw from the provincial capital, one-third of the land is abandoned due to having nothing. Disaster victims gather in groups to flee, resulting in nine out of ten houses being empty, no smoke rising from chimneys, and cries being heard from time to time. The reporter took the time to go to the city and countryside and returned to write, tears welling up in his eyes, almost unable to finish!

Famine and bandits are often inextricably linked. If granaries are empty and people are burning with hunger, there is often no talk of integrity. Poverty drives people. Guilin, which is known for its peaceful security, executed a group of bandits who were wielding knives and robbing people in the suburbs the day before yesterday. The cries of injustice at the time of execution still ring in my ears. Every day, when I walk past the rice shop in front of Zhongzheng East Road, when every rice truck stops, and some grains of rice happen to fall under the truck, I can always see forty or fifty gaunt refugees scrambling under the truck, picking up the grains one by one, carefully putting them in a bowl. The guards wave wooden sticks, raining down on them, but apart from constant groans, no one is willing to leave, no one is willing to miss a grain of rice.

The feathers that the bureaucratic tycoons buy are one ten-thousandth of what they are worth, but they have become treasures that allow them to live. What does a beating matter? What kind of justice is there in this world? The big banks hoard thousands of tons of rice, but say time and again that they are "assisting in stabilizing prices." High-ranking officials as usual issue imperial edicts, earnestly advising people to economize, but at night there is mahjong, there is poker, thousands are thrown away, the extravagant gambling of weighing banknotes with scales, where do we start talking about that?

### On Kunqu Opera

— Dong Meikan

Since the mid-Yuan Dynasty, Southern Opera has gradually improved, achieving even greater leaps during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty (Jiajing period). During the reign of Emperor Shenzong (Wanli period, 1573-1619), numerous playwrights such as Shen Jing and Tang Xianzu emerged, maintaining the brilliance of opera until the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties. Not only in playwriting, but also in performance, Kunqu opera flourished. This period marked the golden age of Southern Opera, and this discussion will focus solely on performance aspects.

Due to geographical factors, the melodies of Southern Opera varied.

"Nanci Xulu" (Record of Southern Lyrics) states: "Singers today refer to Yiyang tune as originating from Jiangxi, used in the two capitals, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong. Yuyao tune originates from Kuaiji, used in Changzhou, Runzhou, Chizhou, Taizhou, Yangzhou, and Xuzhou. Haiyan tune is used in Jiaxing, Huzhou, Wenzhou, and Hezhou. Only Kunshan tune is prevalent in the Wu region." Among the four tunes listed above, Haiyan tune is the oldest, said to have originated in the mid-Southern Song Dynasty with a descendant of Wang Zhangjun of Haifeng. Li Rihua of the Ming Dynasty recorded this in "Zitao Zazhui":

"Zhang Ming, styled Jiang Gongfu, grandson of Xun Wang, pursued extravagance and valued elegance. He once came to my county of Haiyan, built a garden for his pleasure, and ordered singers to perform new tunes, striving for novelty, which became known as Haiyan tune." Later, this tune was promoted by the Yang family of Ganchuan, and it became popular. Yao Tongshou of the Yuan Dynasty wrote in "Lejiao Siyu":

"Many young men in the prefecture are skilled in singing Yuefu poems, all derived from the Yang family of Ganchuan. When Kanghui Gong Zicun was alive, he was known for his chivalrous spirit and mastery of music. He befriended Yunshi, the son of Ali Haiya of Wulin. Yunshi, a handsome young man, excelled in composing Yuefu poems and scattered suites, being the best in the field. His singing could reach the heavens. Lianhui alone inherited his skills. Later, his eldest son Guocai and second son Shaozhong became friends with Xianyu Qujin, who was also skilled in Yuefu poetry. Therefore, among the thousand household servants of the Yang family, none was not proficient in Northern and Southern songs. As a result, the people of the prefecture often learned their family style and became known for their singing throughout Zhejiang." Although Kunqu opera emerged later, it was more refined than other tunes, eventually dominating the operatic scene. The origin of its intricate melody is described in "Nanci Xulu":

"Wei Liangfu combined Haiyan and Yiyang tunes, adding and subtracting elements, creating a new style. Its melody is flowing and far-reaching, surpassing the Haiyan, Yiyang, and Yuyao tunes. Listening to it is deeply moving."

Wei Liangfu (Shangquan) was a native of Kunshan who began to reconcile the disharmony between Southern and Northern opera. According to Yu Huai's "Jichangyuan Wenge Ji":

"Liangfu initially studied Northern tunes but was surpassed by Wang Youshan, a Northerner. He retreated and delved into Southern tunes, remaining in his studio for ten years. At that time, Southern tunes were flat and lacked interest. Liangfu changed the rhythms and created new melodies. The speed, pitch, volume, and timbre were all based on the original keys. He emphasized articulation and added subtle variations, often using embellishments to enhance the sorrowful quality. Old Kunshan musicians who resembled Yuan Ran and You Tuo were all amazed and acknowledged their inferiority."

Furthermore, "Since the people of Wu valued Southern opera, they all praised Wei Liangfu of Kunshan, and Northern opera was almost abandoned." (Shen Defu, "Guqu Zayan"). However, the melodies of Southern opera had not yet reached perfection until Liang Chenyu (Bolong), a fellow townsman of Liangfu, emerged and continued to refine them, finally completing their development. Hu E'lin wrote in "Bi Cong":

"Chengyu could harmonize sounds and rhythms. Liang Bolong followed suit, researching Yuan dramas and creating new tunes, composing 'Jiangdong Baimu' and 'Huansha' melodies. He also collaborated with Zheng Sili to refine the principles of sound. Tang Xiaoyu, Na Meiquan, and others mixed and transformed them, creating a resounding and harmonious sound. The music spread to the mansions of princes and the homes of powerful officials. Those who sought music always followed Bolong's style, calling it Kunqu."

At the same time, Kunqu opera not only surpassed other tunes in melody but also significantly improved the use of instruments, making the singing more gentle and moving, earning the favor of emperors, nobles, and officials. Initially, Northern opera only used stringed instruments, and Southern opera only used wind instruments. With the emergence of Kunqu opera, they were combined.

"Nanci Xulu" states: "Today, Kunshan uses xiao (vertical flute), guan (double-reed wind instrument), sheng (mouth organ), and pipa (lute) to accompany Kunqu opera. Although the words may not match perfectly, the sounds are quite harmonious and pleasing to the ear."

"Xiqu Zayan" states: "Today, in Wu, they all use the sanxian (three-stringed lute) to accompany Southern opera, with the xiao and guan harmonizing."

With elaborate orchestration and music, it naturally became pleasing to the ear. Thus, this tune became extremely popular since the Wanli period, but this also sowed the seeds for its future decline. That is to say, opera is always for the masses, and when it deviates from the masses, it heads towards its demise. After Northern opera faded away, the Yiyang tune of Southern opera was no match for Kunqu. People from both north and south of the Yangtze River were captivated by Kunqu. This glorious period lasted for about a century (until the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty). There were seventy or eighty playwrights who created nearly two hundred new chuanqi (operatic plays). Southern opera plays can truly be said to have reached their peak. However, later on, it increasingly lost the qualities of Yuan drama that Wang Guowei spoke of—naturalness. The lyrics became increasingly classical and profound, filled with clichés and losing touch with the masses. Furthermore, they lacked novelty. Xu Wei, the author of "Nanci Xulu," also felt that playwrights were going down the wrong path, so he said: "Opera should be about moving people's hearts, making it understandable to servants, children, and women. I think it is better to be vulgar and easily understood than to be refined and obscure." This is certainly correct. But what was the state of opera after Kunqu became popular? A passage from Li Diaoyuan's "Yushi Quhua" reveals the situation: "Opera began in the Yuan Dynasty, generally valuing expertise and not elegance. Writing opera requires a certain skill, and embellishing with words and filling it with historical allusions is irrelevant. Since Liang Boneng emerged, he initiated the trend of excessive ornamentation. He lived during the Jiajing and Longqing periods, the time when the Seven Masters (of the literary revival movement) dominated, emphasizing diction. Yanzhou did not delve deeply into this art, but he greatly promoted it out of friendship, unaware that it was not the right path. Therefore, the Wu school competed to imitate clichés, such as 'embroidered boudoirs,' 'silken curtains,' 'bronze water clocks,' 'silver arrows,' 'licentious butterflies,' and 'mad bees.' These phrases were constantly used, becoming monotonous. They even used obscure allusions and fanciful phrases, completely lacking the essence of opera and even the genuine emotions of human life."

### A Strange Sight

— Xie Zi

"Young people will see a strange sight, old people will fall into dreams." This sentence has always been a temptation or a bewilderment for me. I feel like I was born to see this strange sight. I let my body be tempered in suffering, and my soul trek in darkness, all for this enchanting moonlight. It is hauntingly clear, mysteriously intoxicating, and yet so distant that it makes one hesitate. I don't know what the result will be. Perhaps it is like the "blue flower" that Novalis spoke of. I can exhaust my life force to find it, and still not find it. I can touch it in an instant, and at the same time discover that it has disappeared. I can leave many strange traces in my memory, but memory is only memory. I can make my whole life a long series of pursuits, but in the end, I find that I am no longer young and that it is time to fall into dreams.

Fall into dreams: strong longing arises but the result is falling into dreams! Isn't this ironic? Deceiving oneself with dreams, comforting oneself with deception, calming oneself with comfort, just to avoid escaping the realm of dreams - isn't this an illusion? Life is originally an illusion, but there is truth in illusion, and regardless of whether this truth is an illusion within an illusion, our joys and sorrows, laughter and tears, are all arranged on it. We should create a beautiful reality and enjoy a beauty in reality; but we can only see it in the clouds of longing and dreams. We push aside the clouds and move forward bravely, but in the blink of an eye, it has turned into dreams, or longing; we are bewildered by this magical transformation.

There was once a story about a phantom woman, describing a beautiful "phantom woman" whom people could see but not touch. She used a dazzling appearance to lure people, making them chase after her. She herself did not escape, but what people embraced was only emptiness. She aroused a kind of crazy thirst in people's hearts, a thirst that could never be satisfied. People clung to her and let their love turn into flames, but the flames could not destroy her, only burn themselves – burn themselves, and the soul does not die. That soul became her slave, a slave of eternal loyalty. She could arbitrarily command and use them, making herself the queen of that group of pitiful victims.

We may not chase after that phantom woman, but we are indeed chasing after something similar to that phantom woman – that little bit of desolate moonlight. Under the illumination of that moonlight, life becomes a ghost, the world becomes an illusion, and the essence of human intelligence becomes steam. Incense coils in the moonlight, this is a world of ghosts, but in our hearts, we treat it as something else, and decorate it with all the glory and wealth of the world, life and strength, treating it as a magnificent and real stage.

Isn't this very tragic? This is the so-called "strange sight." What is the meaning of this strange sight? Why don't we take back our souls? The soul is our own, and we cannot let it drift in the wind and rain like a kite with a broken string.

Life originally has its natural form, and we cannot let it turn into a shadow; but who can guarantee it? Perhaps this time we escaped the phantom woman's snare, but next time we will grab her skirt, perhaps now we have abandoned that little bit of desolate moonlight, but in the future, we will pursue a little bit of even more desolate and miserable firefly; at that time, the soul will no longer be a kite with a broken string, but an earthworm wriggling in the soil.

Returning from this bleak metaphor, let us take another look at the natural form of life. Nature is not necessarily content with fate, but it is at least self-sufficient and domineering. The trampled grass can continue to grow, and the broken trees can sprout again. The same is true for human beings, who are endowed with this vigorous vitality and resilience; with these, a person can recover from continuous failures and complete the unfinished self that he should complete. But if he has internal contradictions, he can wither away without wind or rain, or attract external lightning and cause his own collapse; what are these contradictions? It is the conflict between spirit and flesh, the contradiction between desire and fate, the discrepancy between poetry and reality; or the struggle between God and Satan. In an individual's life, you can see a microcosm of the world, where battles destroy a peaceful world.

But the world will not die prematurely, and similarly, life should not die prematurely. And what is even more tempting for us is not the eternally clear and bright sky, but the rainbow after the rain; there is also a kind of charm in the prodigal son returning home; perhaps our soul, like that prodigal son who is tired of his narrow family, wants to go to the desert and wilderness to seek a drop of spiritual liquid, using an artificial thirst to ignite the spark of life. But when he bids farewell to the desert and steps on the road home, he is not longing for his father's welcome, or a lavish feast of cooked lamb; but longing for the beginning of a new life. He has stumbled more than once, so he knows how to avoid the vines that trip him; he has wandered on the line between life and death more than once, so he can clearly distinguish what is life and what is death, the magnificent "strange sight" has already emerged in his heart. It is a kind of practice from the inside out, not a blind pursuit; but that blind pursuit is not a waste either, it has prepared him with a kind of intense strength, so that he will not blink in the radiance of ten thousand suns - he will see that "strange sight".

### Han Stone Rubbings

Mr. Xu Weinan collected various painting rubbings from the Qin, Han, and Six Dynasties before the war, amounting to as many as three to four thousand types. Among them are the Nanwuyang Stone Que, Kai Mu Temple, Tangshan, Wu Liang Temple, Zhu Jun Stone Chamber, Tianlongshan, Gongxian Grottoes reliefs, Longmen Grottoes, etc., all famous works are complete. Fortunately, they were not lost during the war, truly a unique and great collection in Shanghai. Now, one Han art rubbing of a phoenix is selected and reproduced on the left page for your appreciation.

### The Lost Heart

— Feng Li

When I step on the moss-covered stones and see the willow branches swaying on the moonlit, shimmering pond, I always feel melancholy. I feel it is a symbol of youth.

My heart is in a state of anxiety and confusion, like a river bursting its banks.

My heart seems to have been lost long ago, but where was it lost?

My heart also seems to be tied in a knot, who can untie this knot for me?

Sitting in the shade of a tree, staring blankly at the sparkling stream, suddenly a thought stirs my memory.

I once read a book of mythology, in which there was a story that someone lost a lovesick heart when he saw his reflection in the stream.

So I immediately climbed to the stream, leaned over and looked at the bottom of the water, but only saw many glittering stars. I reached out to grab them, but couldn't. So I jumped into the water and searched underwater, but everywhere was cold and hard. I quickly floated to the surface and swam in the water for a while. Not giving up, I sank to the bottom of the water again. This time I found it, but it was a harder and colder stone. I held it in my mouth, paddled with my hands, floated up, climbed ashore, and then spat it out into my hand—my poor heart!

### George Bernard Shaw

— Dongfang Mengwu

After the master of humor, George Bernard Shaw, got married, someone asked him what he thought of marriage.

"This is really a very difficult question to answer," Shaw replied. "However, I can say that marriage is like joining a secret society. Those who have not entered naturally do not know its contents, so there is nothing to say. And those members who have entered must keep its internal secrets, so they cannot be made public."

### Rambling Notes on the Ghost City

— Zhe Wu

Fengdu, the ghost city traditionally passed down in folklore, a name imbued with mystery. Death is a mysterious place of no return. Since it is impossible to escape the mysterious place of the dead, wouldn’t the living want to pay homage or visit?

When I first entered Sichuan, I felt an unspeakable strangeness when the ship passed Fengdu, but the ship did not stop, so I had no impression.

In 1943, under the shadow of enemy aircraft bombings, I led a group of theater friends on a tour of "Xiachuan East", which included Fengdu in the itinerary, so I experienced the interesting life there. That experience is still deeply imprinted in my mind.

Fengdu, unlike what is rumored, has no ghostly atmosphere. On the contrary, it is a very quiet small town. It is not a commercial hub, but it is the most comfortable place to live.

The long and tidy roads, with rows of trees planted along the sides, form a "green city" with interwoven branches and leaves. In the depths of spring, the air is exceptionally fresh and comfortable. Not only are the roads well-maintained with shaded avenues, but the magnificent buildings also adorn the city. The residence of a certain division commander has mahogany floors and a well-built ballroom. The modern theater is quite large. The public sound court is equipped with X-ray lights. The Shicun Girls' High School is a well-established base for female education with a considerable history. The painted beams and carved pillars are no less impressive than church schools like Yenching University. The Fengdu Daily is also published daily despite the hardship.

The local authorities are mostly middle-aged gentry in their thirties because the Communist Party passed through this place during the Long March, so many people have "seen the great ocean". Now they are burying themselves in building their own careers.

This ghost city of Fengdu - with its back to the water and mountains, has a very high mountain called "Ming Mountain" which is lined with temples. There is the "Yinwang Temple" on the mountain. Originally there were two people, one surnamed Yin and one surnamed Wang, who practiced alchemy and cultivated the Tao here. Later they separated and it became the "Yanwang Temple" (Temple of the King of Hell). It is said that the saying "Yin and Yang boundary" only appeared in the Qing Dynasty. Beside the road on the mountainside, there is indeed a "Yin and Yang boundary". Besides the words on the stone tablet, there is nothing special about it. "Doing business at night requires placing a basin of water to prevent ghosts from using ghost money to buy things." This is completely unfounded. Along the way up the mountain, there are things you would see in the City God Temple, such as Bai Wuchang (White Impermanence) and Hei Wuchang (Black Impermanence). On the mountain, there is "Naihe Bridge", which are three stone bridges with sloping, slippery stone surfaces. I walked across them and did not fall. There is also "Wangxiang Terrace" (Looking-Homeward Terrace), a desolate mound. There is the Prince’s Hall, the gilded statue of the prince is very tall. There is the "Empty Pillar" Hall. The temple does not collapse because the foundation of a large wooden pillar (three feet in diameter) is rotten, because another pillar supports the point of force. On the mountain, there is a "Son of Heaven Statue" five or six feet high, sculpted in the Son of Heaven Hall, which is the so-called "King Yama," but the sculpture is indeed great and worth admiring. It is said to speed up childbirth. It is said that students from Fengdu who go to school in Chengdu often bring some "inducing spells" to sell, which can earn them some money to pay for tuition.

Fengdu has completely sold the "ghost" gimmick, but the people of Fengdu never admit those "ghost stories". They say that there is a Sichuan saying: "Sending ghosts to Yangzhou." I, a Yangzhou native, paid homage to Fengdu and did not see King Yama, but brought back this novel legend. It turns out that the people of Sichuan think it is a "ghost city."

I remember when I was traveling on Mount Emei, I heard a story. A Sichuan monk went to India to seek the Buddha, but met an Indian monk on the way who was coming to Mount Emei to seek the immortals. As a result, the two laughed and returned to their hometowns! This is really: "Gods and immortals often shine far away, the ghost city follows people's words? It is best to let all "mysteries" remain "permanently" mysterious. Once explored, the divine affairs will lose their brilliance!

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 526

— Ye Jingfeng

"Go upstairs. This room and that big room are full of lights. We turned off the lights in the corridor. My sister and I were on guard outside the door. Sister Shaohua was on guard inside. Sister Hui went into the room alone... At this time, the two people in the room were startled at the same time. They were dressed in the same way, with long-legged military trousers and white shirts. One had a boyish haircut, and the other had a modern perm. As soon as the one with the perm saw Sister Hui enter the room, they began to speak in whispers. Coincidentally, none of the four of us understood Japanese... The two women both had very pretty faces, and we couldn't decide who Miss Ping was for a moment... 'That was just a matter of a second. That permed fellow, maybe speaking Japanese, saw that Sister Hui didn't react, and probably also noticed the three of us outside the door, knowing that something was wrong. But she was also very quick. In a blink of an eye, both hands pulled out weapons. The left hand was a small five-shot pistol, and the right hand was a small Japanese sword - a continuation, probably a sharp thing like an electric knife...'

"'Where are you from?' That woman spoke our language, with a slight Japanese accent..."

"'Oh, you can still talk? I didn't expect it... Sister Hui laughed in her charming way... 'I guess you're not Miss Ping, are you...'"

"The one with the boyish haircut was very clever and guessed what was going on. Ignoring the fact that the woman had weapons in her hands, she went to Sister Hui as if she had met a relative, speaking English and asking if Sister Hui could speak English or French. Sister Hui said, 'I know a little...' The two started to socialize. They shook hands and exchanged a few polite words. Sister Hui asked her if she had just arrived this morning and been tricked into coming here. She nodded, just smiling and about to speak, but her face changed. She quickly raised both hands high. It turned out that the female bandit with the perm got behind her and held a knife against her spine..."

"At this time, Sister Shaohua had just shouted out the words 'Be careful', only to see Sister Hui flash her body and put Miss Ping behind her. It was really fast. Before the female bandit could move, Sister Hui quickly used a grappling technique, with both hands moving like lightning, only brushing over the female bandit's shoulders. The knife and gun in the female bandit's hands fell to the ground at the same time. The color on her face changed immediately, the thick eyebrows wrinkled up, probably because the two arms were so sore and numb that she couldn't stand it..."

"'As long as you don't mess around, we won't hurt you! Understand?' Sister Duan said, and then said it in English to Miss Ping, asking her to translate it to the female bandit..."

"Our matter, this is considered to have come to an end... What was funny was that Miss Ping, before and after translating the two sentences of Sister Hui, bowed to both sides several times, as if she was formally handling international negotiations... As for that female bandit, there was no need to tie her up, but we were afraid that she would not keep her word and would disturb the two drunkards below, which would cause us trouble. So we tied her hands and feet and stuffed her own handkerchief into her mouth. We also restored her two arms that had been dislocated. We can always be considered to have seen things through to the end. We don't know what happened after that. We only know that we walked a long way from the small road in Hongzhen, and seemed to hear something like a ghost crying. Miss Ping said that was the alarm..."

Free Talk

### A Historical Irony

— Bu Shu

The female scholar Bing Xin recently returned from Japan to attend the Political Participation Council. She also delivered a speech on her impressions of Japan to more than two thousand members of the Youth League. The Central News Agency has already transmitted this speech. The entire speech, like Ms. Bing Xin's style, is somewhat poetic and possesses a gentle, feminine beauty. When discussing Japan's recovery, Ms. Bing Xin stated subtly:

"I believe the reason Japan has reached its current state is the lack of a capable leader. What about us? We should now use the power of love to care for them, as if forgiving a younger brother who has done something wrong... Many people fear Japan's recovery; this is incorrect. What we should fear is our own failure to recover. Although Japan has suffered significant war damage, with MacArthur's assistance, it is gradually moving towards democracy and recovery. Looking back at ourselves, I feel deeply saddened."

These words are extremely subtle yet powerful. Having been in Japan for half a year, she has seen nothing but ruins and desolation, yet she has glimpsed a glimmer of "vitality" from the rubble—the Japanese people's silent endurance and humiliation under the Allied occupation. They do not clamor, boast, or quarrel among themselves; they simply work in silence. This "silence" may not necessarily be a benevolent attitude, but it inspires deep speculation and a sense of awe.

As of now, Japan's situation remains quite peculiar:

In the face of the strong, it is a weakling; in the face of the weak, who knows? Perhaps in just three to five years, it will once again be an arrogant strongman.

Amidst the turbulence of American and Soviet power, the American policy of supporting Japan's recovery seems unlikely to change. Therefore, Ms. Bing Xin's words, "Many people fear Japan's recovery; this is incorrect. What we should fear is our own failure to recover," are truly insightful. Just as a lame cripple should not hope for others to break their arms, China should not try to keep Japan mired in the mud due to its own lack of ambition.

The question is whether Japan's path to recovery will align with democratic principles. If, after the lesson of the atomic bomb, Japan ultimately returns to the path of militarism, then another "recovery" will only lead to another "destruction."

Historical irony is the most ruthless; no matter how strong a person is, they cannot withstand the erosion of time. Nazi Germany built countless concentration camps to promote their fascist education, but in the end, under Allied control, these concentration camps were filled with Nazi officers and jailers themselves. In Japan, there are also many such historical ironies. When a reporter interviewed Ms. Bing Xin, she said:

"After the war, the Japanese people are universally impoverished... On the streets of Tokyo, many large bank buildings were destroyed, leaving only the safes. Many people sleep in these safes. Before the war, Japan imported a large amount of scrap iron from the United States every year. Now, scrap iron is everywhere in Japan. The evolution of history often contains humor amidst desolation."

Perhaps future Japan, unable to extricate itself from the clutches of militaristic righteousness, will see scrap iron once again become fortunate. But what will be the ultimate outcome? Its evolutionary process will be nothing more than: scrap iron - guns - scrap iron, ad infinitum.

### Talking about Spiritual Sensation

— Bao Qing

Professor Rhine, a psychologist, and his assistants at Duke University, after seventeen years of research, have finally proven the existence of a sixth sense beyond the five senses of sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell—extrasensory perception. American magazine *Fortune* has also cited many materials, learning that all mentally normal people, especially those with close relationships such as couples or twins, should have the possibility of a sixth sense.

In fact, this extrasensory perception is a "spiritual sensation." As the saying goes, "a sudden impulse," is a vivid portrayal of this sensation. Spiritual sensation cannot be controlled, and its occurrence is conditional. The person experiencing the sensation must: be of calm disposition; have no special hobbies; be physically strong with delicate and sensitive nerves; and possess a strong will with common sense, able to react and synthesize multiple aspects of thinking. People with these qualities are most likely to foresee future events under certain environmental changes.

Chen Guofu once created the "Theory of Electrical Induction," which is an evolution of this spiritual sensation. He believed that spiritual sensation is indeed a phenomenon born of sensation, but it is actually an inconceivable spiritual wireless (or brainwave) emitted from the mind of a person with dedicated spirituality, reaching the mind of the thinker who has been involved with him and has had spiritual contact, causing thought or imagery. Chen used this to explain ghost tales and prove the formation of dreams. This formation is invariably born of premonition; therefore, I consider the Theory of Electrical Induction to be a theory of spiritual sensation.

If we recall past experiences, there must be coincidences or premonitions, which are the result of spiritual sensation. The author has experienced the following two events as proof: one, while serving in the interior, more than two hundred miles from home, my wife was about to give birth. Having not received news for many days, I suddenly felt extremely uneasy one morning and urgently tried to make a long-distance phone call. It finally connected in the afternoon, and I learned that my daughter had been born at one o'clock that morning. The other, when my brother-in-law passed away, his aunt in Xi'an suddenly dreamed of seeing my brother-in-law sitting in his mother's arms, which she found strange, and soon after, the bad news arrived. Furthermore, we often predict that someone will come or how someone will be in the future, which often proves true. Also, when we talk about someone, they often happen to arrive at that moment. These are also common spiritual sensations.

This spiritual sensation, the ability to sense future events outside the five senses, is truly an inconceivable and mysterious thing.

### Heroes and Beauties – Random Notes on History, Part 3

— Xiao Dai

Heroes, it seems, cannot do without a few beauties as adornments, otherwise, they would feel lonely. This is true in both ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, but we Chinese express it even more splendidly.

Throughout history, heroes, upon achieving fame and fortune, laying down their weapons, embrace beauties and indulge in a life of extravagant pleasure. Empires can be lost, honest advisors can be killed, but beauties are indispensable. How many emperors in the past have offered up their great empires to others under such licentious living? Despite so many warnings from the past, they seem insufficient to alert the heroes of later generations. They continue to follow the same old path, heading towards destruction.

Let's take the example of King You of Zhou. The Records of the Grand Historian, Basic Annals of Zhou, states:

"King Xuan died, and King You ascended the throne... King You favored Bao Si. Bao Si gave birth to a son named Bofu. King You wanted to depose the crown prince, whose mother was the daughter of Marquis Shen. After the king obtained Bao Si, he loved her and wanted to depose Marquis Shen and remove the crown prince Xuan Jiu, making Bao Si queen and Bofu the crown prince... Grand Historian Boyang said, 'Disaster is coming, there is no remedy!' Bao Si did not like to laugh, and King You wanted her to laugh by any means, but she would not laugh. King You ordered the lighting of the beacon fires and the beating of the drums. When enemies arrived, the beacon fires would be lit, and the lords would all come. But when they arrived and there were no enemies, Bao Si would laugh heartily. King You was pleased and repeatedly ordered the lighting of the beacon fires. Later, no one believed them, and the lords no longer came. King You appointed Shi Fu as a minister. He was put in charge of affairs, and the people all resented him. Shi Fu was a flattering and greedy person. The king used him and also deposed Queen Shen and removed the crown prince. Marquis Shen was enraged and attacked King You with the Western Yi Quanrong. King You ordered the lighting of the beacon fires to summon troops, but no troops came. King You was killed at the foot of Mount Li. Bao Si was captured, and all the treasures of Zhou were taken away."

Another example is Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The History of Zhou, Annals of Emperor Xuan, says:

"The Emperor... upon succeeding to the throne, immediately indulged his desires. During the mourning period for the late emperor, he showed no signs of grief. He immediately inspected the late emperor's concubines and engaged in widespread debauchery. Barely a year had passed before he indulged in song and dance. He selected beautiful women from all over the country to fill his harem. He loved showing off and exaggerating, and refused to listen to advice. After abdicating the throne, his voice grew even more arrogant and extravagant. He indulged in his harem, sometimes not emerging for days. Officials and close ministers who wanted to report matters all had to go through eunuchs."

"Wen, the Duke of Xiyang, was the son of Liang, the Duke of Qiguo. He was the emperor's cousin. His wife, Lady Yuchi, was beautiful. When she entered the court, the emperor forced her to drink wine and raped her. Liang heard of this and, fearing punishment, rebelled. Wen was falsely accused and killed, and Lady Yuchi was forced into the palace, first as a concubine and then as the empress. Whenever he summoned officials to discuss matters, he only wanted to build and innovate, never mentioning politics..."

The former personally dug his own grave and then climbed inside, while the latter debauched his father's concubines and his cousin's wife. Within a few years, he handed over the empire to Emperor Wen of Sui (Yang Jian).

Some say that women are a source of trouble, like vipers, and that seven or eight out of ten who lose their empires do so because of women. At first glance, saying that "they were ruined by women" seems to have some reason, but upon closer inspection, it is not necessarily so. It would be best to ask those heroes why they abandoned their own yellow-faced wives and insisted on shamelessly pursuing other women.

I think the heroes are unable to give a definite answer to this question.

### Nostalgic Song – Mount Gele

— Ai Yin'er

Anyone who has traveled to Sichuan will know Mount Gele!

Mount Gele is more than thirty kilometers away from Chongqing. Legend says that Li Bing and his son, who built the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in Chengdu during the Qin Dynasty, once came here to work and relax, hence the name.

From Chongqing, taking a car to Shapingba or Xiaolongkan, you can see the vast, lush, and continuous mountain range. Among them, the towering and verdant Mount Gele, makes you think it has a kind of unique spiritual energy. It is as if one were gazing at Zhong Mountain from outside Nanjing, but its steepness and boldness seem to surpass Zhong Mountain.

The mountain is covered with pine forests, showing no sign of autumn, giving people a sense of "eternal spring." The mountain paths are deep and winding, and the car road stretches to Kuanren Hospital. The location of Kuanren Hospital is secluded and quiet, shaded by pines and bamboos, with a unique charm.

Chongqing is notoriously hot, known as the "Incense Burner," but Mount Gele is refreshingly pleasant. The climate differs by ten degrees. Strolling along the mountain path, shaded everywhere, one does not feel the dread of summer, and winter is not severely cold. Wind and snow seem to be visitors who leave as soon as they arrive, only endless clouds and mists occasionally give it a emerald veil. When the sun sets behind the mountains, a cluster of golden rays shoots out from behind the mountain, gently supporting the lush, ink-like, massive mountain silhouette, like a painting, like a dream, like a scene from a fairy tale. How many young students in Shapingba have been drawn to this.

Climbing the jagged rocks behind Lingding Temple leads to the mountain's highest peak. From here, overlooking the Jialing River, it looks like a stream of water, with sails almost indistinguishable. On clear days, one can also see Mount Jinyun in the northwest corner. Sometimes, one can also see an endless sea of clouds, white, vast, and surging. Only at this time does one think of becoming an immortal, of "life being like an illusion, ultimately returning to nothingness," but also of the hateful side of the unpredictable and turbulent clouds.

Entering the night, borrowing the faint starlight, walk around to a pine tree and sit with your chin in your hand, watching the lights on both sides of the Jialing River for a while. Thousands of lights in Ciqikou and Panxi, like fireflies, like countless eyes. Suddenly, a red light flashes, flames soar, which is the fire spouting from the arsenal in Ciqikou.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Mount Gele was a relocation area. To avoid air raids, Chongqing's institutions, banks, and people mostly dispersed to the mountains, and many air-raid shelters were dug. The Examination Yuan, the Ministry of Personnel, the Water Conservancy Commission, and several national banks were all relocated to the mountain. Many people built houses and lived among the lush pine forests. When enemy planes attacked, families, old and young, and office workers fled to the air-raid shelters, safe and sound. Therefore, Chairman Lin once resided on the mountain, and Ma Yinchu, Xie Bingxin, Zang Kejia, and others also spent a difficult time on the mountain.

During summer and winter vacations, I had nowhere to go, so I often visited Mount Gele. During my stay, it dispelled my worries and broke my loneliness. Now, I have been separated from Mount Gele for thousands of miles, and it has been almost a year. The wind and rain, every plant and tree on the mountain constantly linger in my dreams, and I have an unspeakable feeling of nostalgia.

### Talking About Musical Style

— Sheng He

Music, like literature, architecture, or other arts, has its unique style, exerting a particularly unique appeal. The style of music is not only related to geographical environment and national character but also closely related to the composer's style and historical background.

Although some people compare music to "flowing architecture," making it difficult to distinguish its content from its form, listeners can understand its style and increase their appreciation if they carefully observe the composer's thoughts, composing motives, historical background, and special creations in music. For example, when listening to Beethoven's "Eroica Symphony," one must understand the composer's political views and the democratic ideas of the time. Also, when listening to Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique," one must understand his composing motives and the frequent appearance of the "idée fixe" in the piece, used to express the composer's beautiful and bitter fantasies.

Also, in Wagner's music dramas, the "leitmotif," often uses short musical phrases to symbolize characters and events in the drama, which is an important factor in his musical drama works. In addition, there are works composed by composers using folk music with national character and local color, such as Chopin, who used Polish folk dance music to create many excellent dance pieces, such as "Mazurka" and "Polonaise," which not only have the magic of turning decay into something miraculous but can also express a special and distinct style.

### Chronicle of a City in Crisis

— Qin Shouou

"I want to go with Mom! I want to..." Fei Fei also cried and made a fuss.

"Don't make a fuss! Fei Fei, don't make a fuss, Mom is going with you." Zhu Zhaonian hurriedly comforted her. "Now, be good and wait for Dad to sort out your suitcases!"

Time did not allow him to say more, and he immediately started busy and flustered with Zhang Chang. However, he was, after all, a man, and still a virgin who had never married. It was inevitable that he would be a bit clumsy when sorting out women's and children's things, and it actually took longer. Finally, he quietly took out all the money from his pants pocket and stuffed it into Lan's suitcase.

"Old Zhu, Mrs. Hu is waiting for you!" Zhang Chang had already packed up and suddenly called him over.

Lan's eyeballs seemed to be covered with a layer of flowing oil, appearing dim and lackluster. She only looked at Zhu Zhaonian once and then closed them again.

"I think Wenfei shouldn't come with me... with me... it's better... My illness is... is... contagious," she struggled to say. "You work... hard... take... take her and go..."

This reminded Old Zhu that typhus was not only a contagious disease but also a highly contagious one. Therefore, he also thought of Zhang Chang.

"That's right, it's better not to have her with you." He first replied to Lan, then pulled Zhang Chang aside and immediately asked him to switch places with him, only hoping that he would write a letter of introduction to his uncle so that Lan could receive the most effective treatment. However, Zhang Chang was unusually stubborn, insisting on not agreeing. His reason was that Old Zhu, as the leader of the entire group, could not leave the group no matter what, and there was truly no one in the country with the talent to replace him. If he left, the entire group would inevitably disintegrate. And for the sake of Old Zhu's own reputation, he should not do this, as people might have ulterior motives.

### Starting from the Shaoyang Massacre

— Xu Zhou

The Shaoyang Yonghe Gold Shop Massacre in Hunan became very complicated because it involved Sun Zuoqi, the commissioner of the Sixth District. Under the doctrine of "officials protecting each other," Sun Zuoqi's protection of his son's crime was simply boundless. Recently, this Commissioner Sun was finally dismissed and investigated when Chairman Wu Dongyuan of Hunan Province toured western Hunan. This is indeed a great achievement, but we still have to wait and see the follow-up of the Shaoyang Massacre.

"Officials protecting each other" was originally a major doctrine in officialdom. The so-called "selling favors," "using public office for private gain," "borrowing flowers to offer to Buddha," "covering up shortcomings," etc., are just a few items under this doctrine. In China, because people are used to seeing stories of "one person becoming a Buddha, even the chickens and dogs ascend to heaven," they are not surprised by "officials protecting each other." Feng Menglong's "Guang Xiaofu":

"Kongzi's disciples entered the examination. When the results were announced, it was heard that Zizhang was ranked nineteenth. Everyone said, 'He looks impressive, which must be good.' Then it was announced that Zilu was ranked thirteenth. Everyone said, 'This rough man also got a high score, thanks to his courage.' Then it was announced that Yan Yuan was ranked twelfth. Everyone said, 'He is knowledgeable, so he was wronged.' Then it was announced that Gongye Chang was ranked high. Everyone exclaimed, 'We usually don't see how he is, how did he get such a high score?' One person said, 'Thanks to his support.' Asked: Who supported him? Answered: His father-in-law.'"

Although this is a joke, it is full of human interest. If a country allows the existence of "one person becoming a Buddha, even the chickens and dogs ascend to heaven," over time, it will form a class of Buddhas, a class of chickens and dogs in heaven, and a class of wronged ghosts in hell. Noble families will always be noble families, and a barefooted man will always be a barefooted man. If someone also wants to ascend to heaven, then he should form a close relationship with the "Buddhas" like geese and dogs, just like Liu Laolao flattering Wang Fengjie in *Dream of the Red Chamber*.

This reminds me of Mr. Xiao Qian's words.

Mr. Xiao Qian admired Swiss-style democracy very much and greatly praised it in a communication called "A Trip to Switzerland." In his opinion, Swiss democracy is the most primitive, and political power comes from the bottom up, from the smallest unit. The president of the federal government is absolutely directly under the parliament, without the great power of Roosevelt or Churchill. The federal parliament is authorized by the twenty-five provincial parliaments. Even minor positions (such as the ambassador to China) must be appointed through elections. Therefore, in Switzerland, even if Confucius became a high official, Gongye Chang would still be a commoner and unable to have his father-in-law "support" him. A country that values the rule of law often cannot overemphasize human relationships. In fact, even in England, isn't Prime Minister Attlee's son a sailor on a steamboat? The official system in democratic countries is definitely not hereditary, and in the eyes of Little Attlee, the status of a sailor is no lower than that of any civil servant. Xiao Qian once told a very vivid story:

"On a tram in Geneva, Switzerland, an American soldier talked to a Swiss man about how democratic the United States was, saying that you can enter the White House at any time. The small Swiss man replied shyly, in Switzerland, there is no boundary between the president and the common people. 'Have you met the Swiss president then?' the American soldier asked. The small Swiss man said apologetically, 'I am him.'" ("Life Interviews," page 18)

Under the rule of such a Swiss president, Gongye Chang, besides being a "bird language expert," is afraid that he would have no other way out.
