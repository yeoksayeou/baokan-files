[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department stated in a speech on the afternoon of the 9th: Since the successful conclusion of the National Assembly, the constitutional work has been completed, and the national construction plan can be actively carried out in accordance with the procedures decided by the National Assembly. The government's long-cherished wish to return power to the people can also be fulfilled. Therefore, the government is willing to sincerely negotiate with the Chinese Communists on specific measures for ceasing conflict and reorganizing the government, in order to realize peaceful reunification as soon as possible.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Lei Zhen returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 9th. After a short rest, he visited the Chairman at around 10:00 AM to report on the discussions with various parties in Shanghai. They talked for about an hour. He then visited Wang Shijie. That evening, he took a car to Shanghai at 11:00 PM and is expected to return on the 11th or 12th. He told reporters that the participation of various parties in the government and the resumption of peace talks are two separate matters. While in Shanghai, he exchanged opinions with Zhang Lan, Zhang Junmai, and others several times. The Democratic League advocates resuming negotiations first, but no concrete plan has been put forward. Within the Social Democratic Party, internal attitudes have not yet matured. Zhang Junmai is likely to come to Nanjing next week. Zhang Qun and Sun Ke may return on Sunday. Wu Tiecheng will remain in Shanghai to recuperate due to a minor illness.

[This Newspaper Report] Zhang Qun and Zhang Junmai had a meeting yesterday, the contents of which are unknown. However, Sun Baoyi, a spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party, told reporters that the Social Democratic Party is not absolutely opposed to participating in the government, but believes that peace talks should be resumed before the government is reorganized. Although this matter is very difficult, they still hope that the government will do its best, clearly state the limits of the negotiations, so that the government's sincere efforts to seek peace can be made clear to the world. Only when the domestic turmoil ends can the reorganization of the government have meaning. At the same time, before the government is reorganized, it should first implement various reforms within its power. For example, freedom of assembly and association must be fully guaranteed. Sun stated that Zhang Junmai's opinions to the government representatives would not go beyond the above two points.

[Central News Agency, This City] Zuo Shunsheng and Li Huang of the Youth Party, Zhang Junmai, Wu Xianzi, and Wan Renqian of the Social Democratic Party, visited Zhang Qun together at 9:00 AM yesterday morning to continue exchanging views on the reorganization of the government and other issues. The two parties are scheduled to hold a joint meeting today to formulate a common opinion, and then visit Zhang Qun tomorrow to further discuss based on this common opinion.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Zhang Lisheng said on the 9th that he had not yet studied Marshall's statement in detail, but believed that the United States' policy of hoping for peace and unity in China must remain consistent and that its policy toward China would not change. Regarding the reorganization of the government, the government is very eager for it. The participation of the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party is likely only a matter of time. Regarding the resumption of peace talks, the government will do its best if possible.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Zhang Zhizhong hosted a lunch for the representatives of Xinjiang Province, including Ahmetjan Qasimi, on the 9th. In the evening, Jiang Menglin hosted a dinner to welcome Zhang back, with Lei Zhen and Zhang Lisheng accompanying.

### Laws to Match the New Constitution Can Be Completed Within Six Months; The Ministry of Judicial Administration is Currently Studying Them

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A reporter recently met with Yang Zhaolong, Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and asked how the legal system would be coordinated with the implementation of the new constitution. He replied that the Ministry of Judicial Administration is currently conducting research on the following three matters: (1) How the legal system should be coordinated with the new constitution, such as issues related to the rights and obligations of the people, are all being planned. (2) The Chinese legal system was imitated from the West, and there are some aspects that are not suitable for China's national conditions or conflict with traditional Chinese concepts. We are currently trying to study and improve them. (3) The Ministry of Judicial Administration has now hired Professor Pound of Harvard University as a consultant to the Ministry. Professor Pound is a famous legal expert today. He visited China once before and has now accepted the invitation. The date of departure will not be far off. Professor Pound also suggested that the Chinese government try to complete a systematic legal masterpiece on China's current laws for the reference of all relevant parties. This matter is also being discussed in detail. The first two items mentioned above can be completed within six months, and the third item will probably take longer.

### The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association is a Research and Investigation Organization, Not Responsible for Actual Responsibilities

Branch associations will not be established in various provinces; only a standing committee will be established in the central government. It is also heard that government representatives will account for 60 members of the association, and Wu Zhihui may serve as the chairman. There will be three vice-chairmen, one each from Sun Ke, the Youth Party, and the Social Democratic Party. There will also be a secretary-general.

### Luo Longji Comments on Marshall's Statement

[This Newspaper Report] Luo Longji, a spokesperson for the Democratic League, formally commented on Marshall's farewell statement yesterday, praising Marshall as a "frank and sincere statesman" whose views were unique and worthy of being called China's "honest friend." However, there were also points of "disagreement." For example, the statement mentioned the end of the Kuomintang's tutelage, which he believed was "inconsistent with the facts." At the same time, Luo did not agree with Marshall's praise of the Chinese Constitution and the coalition government, and he criticized the government for undermining the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Finally, he believed that the failure of Marshall's mediation efforts over the past year was due to the contradictions in the US policy toward China itself, and he hoped that the new Secretary of State would "modify future policies toward China based on the wishes of the Chinese people."

### The Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party Praise Marshall's Statement

[Central News Agency, This City] After Marshall's statement was released, all parties attached great importance to it. The Standing Committee of the Youth Party met at 5:00 PM yesterday to conduct a thorough study of Marshall's statement. The Standing Committee of the Social Democratic Party also discussed it.

Zuo Shunsheng, Minister of Propaganda of the Youth Party, said that after reading General Marshall's statement carefully, we fully understand its meaning, recognize that it is quite profound and correct. We said the day before yesterday that the United States' policy toward China allows for considerable technical modifications, but the basic spirit will never change. Now, after reading the content of his statement, we know that our view is generally correct. Marshall's stay for a year has given him a full understanding of the overall situation in the world, especially in the Far East, and his judgment is particularly clear. This time, he has been appointed to the important position of Secretary of State, and we can anticipate that he will achieve something. Before the Political Consultative Conference, I exchanged views with Marshall on the plan drafted by the Youth Party at that time. The success of the Political Consultative Conference was largely due to Marshall's spiritual support. In this statement, Marshall emphasized the hope that we would implement this democratic constitution based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference, which shows that Marshall's views have been consistent from beginning to end, which is gratifying to us.

Sun Baoyi, a spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party, said: Marshall's statement is undoubtedly the best diagnosis of China's political illness. It pointed out that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference could have served as the basis for peaceful national construction. This basis has collapsed due to the obstruction and suspicion of some people in the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The hope for peaceful national construction lies in the rise of the moderate elements of the two parties and other enlightened elements. This understanding is quite accurate. The Social Democratic Party has always advocated democracy and will actively strive to realize democratic politics without lagging behind.

### Adjusting Military Personnel's Salaries, Increasing Allowances to the Same Amount as Civil Servants; Has Been Submitted to the Highest Authorities for Approval

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The competent authorities of the Ministry of National Defense have drafted two plans for adjusting the salaries of military personnel: (1) The special treatment of military personnel throughout the country will be based on the supply area. The Dihua area will increase by 100%, the Nanjing-Shanghai area by 80%, Zhengzhou and Kaifeng by 60%, the Wuhan area by 40%, and the Chongqing and Diankang areas by 20%. (2) This new salary adjustment will not be based on the supply area, except for Mongolia, Taiwan, and Xinjiang, where the currency value is significantly different. The increase rate will be uniform throughout the country, without salary increases, but with increased allowances. The increased amount will be equal to the salaries of civil servants and teachers, and physical objects will be issued. It is heard that the Ministry has submitted it to the highest authorities for approval. In addition, the food allowance for officers and soldiers throughout the country was 7,500 yuan in the 35th year, and some physical objects were issued. Now, due to soaring prices and the inconvenience of handling physical objects, the authorities have changed the food allowance to 15,000 yuan and implemented it from January of the 36th year.

### Xiong Shihui Arrives in Beiping from Shenyang, Will Go to Nanjing Tomorrow to Report on the Situation in the Northeast; Negotiations to Take Over Dalian Will Begin Immediately

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 9th] Xiong Shihui, accompanied by Xu Pengfei, Director of the Xingyuan Office, Guan Bangjie, Director of the Second Department, and Secretary Liu Ting, flew to Beiping by special plane at 11:00 AM on the 9th.

At 7:00 PM, he hosted a banquet for the National Assembly representatives from the Northeast who had returned from Nanjing. According to those around him, Xiong plans to stay for one day and fly to Nanjing on the 11th to report on his duties. Xiong denied the rumors of Liang Huasheng's resignation to reporters, saying that the Northeast Xingyuan has been reorganized and reduced to eight departments, and the number of personnel has been reduced to only one-third of the original.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] Negotiations to take over Dalian are still pending. Xiong Shihui told reporters today that the government has not yet taken over Dalian. It is learned that the national and communist armies near Dalian are still confronting each other in Pulandian. The diplomatic contacts between China and the Soviet Union in Andong are intermittent. The Northeast Diplomatic Commissioner's Office recently sent Xu Liqun, Director of the Second Department, to Andong to negotiate with the Soviet military authorities in North Korea on the sovereignty of the Shuifeng Power Plant, navigation on the Yalu River, and demarcation issues, but without results. Chiang Ching-kuo recently made a trip to the Northeast and will go to the Northeast again soon, which seems to be related to Northeast diplomacy.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] According to the Northeast Xingyuan Office in Nanjing, Xiong Shihui flew from Shenyang to Beiping at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 9th. After arriving in Beiping, he consulted with local military and political leaders on important matters and will come to Nanjing in two days.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 9th] After several days of patrolling the outskirts of Dalian, the reporter learned in the military field that the national army has stopped its activities on the edge of the Dalian urban area and is using most of its forces to clear the communist army in the area north of the Pulandian-Piziwo highway to Xiukeng. From Shihe south to Lushun and Dalian, there are about 100,000 Soviet troops and many communist troops.

### We Should Calmly Review Marshall's Advice; Shao Lizi Issues a Statement

### Gu Zhutong Resigns from Concurrent Positions; Hu Zongnan Will Be Transferred to Director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, has been serving concurrently as Director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters for four months.

### The National Assembly Election Office Was Established in April of This Year to Handle Matters Related to the Election of National Assembly Representatives

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The government will establish a National Assembly Election Office in April to handle matters related to the election of representatives. In addition, the Secretariat of the National Assembly is rushing to complete its work. During the transition period, the office's business may be handled by the Ministry of Interior.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A person in charge of the Secretariat of the National Assembly recently stated that among the passengers who died in the plane crash in Qingdao on January 5th was Li Runshen. Recently, there have been rumors that Li was a National Assembly representative and that Ding Youmin replaced him at the conference. Therefore, the deceased was actually Ding Youmin, who was impersonating National Assembly representative Li Runshen. According to all the records in the association, Li Runshen was originally a National Assembly representative. However, before the opening of the conference, the Secretariat approved the notification from the National Assembly Election Office that Li should not be registered temporarily because there was an unsettled case. Therefore, Li Runshen never attended the conference from the opening to the closing. The rumors are obviously inconsistent with the facts.

### Ministry of National Defense Issues Statement Elucidating the Chinese Communist Army's Warmongering Intentions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A military spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense issued a statement saying: Since the issuance of successive ceasefire orders, no matter how the facts of the war caused by the Chinese Communist Army's attack on the National Army have evolved, no matter what the results of the battles on both sides, the Ministry has never published any war reports or promoted propaganda to exaggerate its own victories and exaggerate the losses of the Communist Army. Because the government is building the country and alleviating the people's difficulties, it is willing to make all kinds of concessions and compromises. Its desire for peace is extremely sincere. Therefore, it believes that party rifts and internal strife bloodshed, regardless of who wins or loses, are shameful and painful, and it cannot bear to publicize them superficially, let alone take the wounds of compatriots as a happy event. However, since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Communist Party has not been ashamed of the civil war, but has agitated propaganda and done its best to fabricate and exaggerate military affairs. This shows that the Communist Party has no sincerity in seeking peace in politics and has other unfathomable intentions in propaganda. Since the opening of the National Assembly, the Communist Party has repeatedly exaggerated its war results and fabricated losses of the National Army. According to its casualty reports, the National Army has long since ceased to exist. For example, in the war report issued by the Chinese Communist Party yesterday on the Battle of Southern Shandong, it listed the annihilation of the entire 4th Regiment of the Central Direct Traffic Corps. In fact, there has never been such a number in the National Army. It also claimed to have "captured Brigade Commander Che Fanru," but Che is currently the Deputy Director of the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Headquarters and is still seen safely coming to the Ministry to work. It also claimed that the national army suffered more than 27,000 casualties in this battle. Then the national army in the area has completely ceased to exist. Counting the days, the Communist Army should celebrate the occupation of Xuzhou. Why is it still struggling in the mud of Southern Shandong and coming so late? The above are just a few examples to reveal the essence of the Communist Army's past war reports, correct the public's hearing, distinguish between truth and falsehood, and clarify its warmongering atmosphere. In the future, in addition to expressing the utmost regret for disharmonious events in various places, it will not publish war reports.

### Marshall Arrives in Hawaii; Refuses to Make Political Statements; Chairman Praises General Deng as a Man of Action and Few Words

[United Press International, Honolulu, 9th] Marshal Marshall, returning to the United States from China to assume his new position as Secretary of State, arrived here by plane today. It is said that he will stay in Hawaii for a few days before going to Washington. Five minutes after Marshal Marshall disembarked, he and his wife left the airport by car. When asked by reporters, he declined to make any political statements, replying: "If reporters wish to meet with me, I will receive them, but I have no statement to make."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Special Envoy Marshall, summoned by President Truman, left Beijing on the morning of the 8th to return to his country. The special envoy arrived in Shanghai on December 20, 1945, under orders, and flew to the capital after the victory on the 21st to meet with Chairman Chiang. He arrived in Chongqing on the 22nd and began working towards peace and unity in China, striving to promote the Political Consultative Conference and the issuance of the ceasefire order, and assisting in the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Department's military three-person group. On February 15, the "Basic Military Program" was signed in Chongqing. In March, the special envoy accompanied government representative Minister Zhang Zhizhong and CCP representative Zhou Enlai, traveling tirelessly to Zhangjiakou, Jining, Gui Sui, Taiyuan, Jinan, Xuzhou, Hankou and other places to thoroughly implement the ceasefire order. On June 7, he facilitated the issuance of the order to cease conflict in the Northeast. In July and August, the special envoy worked tirelessly to mediate peace, climbing Mounts 儿上. The special envoy also indirectly commanded the U.S. military stationed in China to complete the arduous task of repatriating Japanese prisoners and residents. The special envoy arrived in China on December 7 of the year before last and left yesterday. Apart from returning to his country once last March to report on his duties, he stayed in China for a total of thirteen months. Over the past year, due to wartime destruction and more than a year of domestic turmoil, transportation was blocked and the economy was in peril. During this period, Marshal Marshall worked tirelessly to solve these problems. President Truman stated in his China policy statement on December 18 of last year that "Marshal Marshall's experience and wisdom are sufficient to help China make its own efforts to solve these problems." The special envoy's achievements will be forever remembered by the Chinese people. What is particularly commendable is the understanding and friendship between Chairman Chiang and the special envoy personally, which their wives also shared. Marshal and Mrs. Marshall celebrated Christmas twice with the Chairman and his wife after the war. The Chairman also accompanied them on walks and excursions to the Xia Ying Kuang Ying and Taihu Lake to avoid birthdays, allowing the beautiful scenery to complement the outstanding individuals. The Chairman once praised the special envoy as: "The General is a great man of action and few words." He is focused on practicality rather than formality. He has quick decision-making skills, noble goals, and keen insight, and is truly a model of an outstanding military man. As the special envoy returns to his country to take up the post of Secretary of State, the people of his country have high expectations for his mission and firmly believe that his outstanding talents and character will make a great contribution to world peace.

### National Army Close to Giant City, Only Twenty Li Away; Shuyang Can Be Recaptured Any Day; Fierce Fighting Still Ongoing in the Jiangsu-Shandong Border Area

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] After the National Army recovered Machang Town, it continued to advance. Xiaowangji and Lizhuang, only 20 li away from Shuyang, were recovered by the National Army last night. Gunfire was incessant in Shuyang city all day yesterday, reportedly due to internal strife within the Communist army. The city can be taken any day. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Huaiyin: The National Army in Lianshui, in order to crush the Communist army's attempt to invade southwards along the Tongyu Line, completely defeated the Communist army at Dongshunhe this morning at dawn.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] Military news: The Communist army that fled from Shuyang to Lincheng in southern Shandong, and the Communist army that fled from Su to Yaowan in Pi County, are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. As of last night, Yaowan was still in the hands of the National Army, and Lincheng is currently in a state of confused fighting. Furthermore, Yixian is currently surrounded by the Communist army. The Communist army once forced its way into the South Gate and outside the Canglang Gate of Yixian. After the National Army bravely resisted and killed or wounded one Communist battalion commander, the offensive was slightly frustrated. It is reported that fierce battles are still raging between Zaozhuang and Yixian. It is learned that among the Communist army in southern Shandong, not only are Japanese artillerymen assisting in the fighting, but there are also many newly manufactured heavy machine guns. The Communist army's plan is clearly to seize several important strategic strongholds in the Jiangsu-Shandong border area, besiege Yixian, Xiangcheng, Lanling, and Taierzhuang, in order to threaten Xuzhou and thereby rescue the Communist army in Funing and Shuyang, which are already heavily besieged by the National Army. Therefore, they are taking great risks and fighting fiercely with the National Army. However, according to military figures who recently arrived here from northern Jiangsu, the center of gravity of the current war situation has shifted to southern Shandong. The Communist army intends to avoid strength and strike at weakness, so it has launched a widespread and large-scale offensive in southern Shandong, using a force of approximately three divisions, almost making a desperate gamble. This is different from the Communist army's past style of solely preserving strength. If they do not change their course soon, they will encounter unprecedented bad luck within ten days, because General Xue Yue and General Wu Qichuan, who has now personally arrived at the front to supervise the battle, are fully aware of the Communist army's conspiracy to launch a large-scale invasion. The war situation in the Jiangsu-Shandong border area has reached a critical juncture, and the outcome will be known within three days.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] Six divisions of the Communist army launched a new offensive against the National Army on the Taizao branch line. After the National Army put up a strong resistance in Yixian, Zaozhuang, and Taierzhuang, they suffered heavy losses. The war situation on that line has turned into a stalemate.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 8th] Around Xigang and Sunjiazai on the border of Teng and Pei, more than 8,000 Communist troops sneaked in on the 8th. Furthermore, at Wangkou and Mankou, two ferry crossings on the important shore of Weishan Lake, the Communist army is currently concentrating more than 200 wooden boats and is conscripting stretcher bearers and civilians in Jisuo Town, plotting to stir up trouble.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] While the National Army in Guoyang was being transferred, the 7,000-strong Communist army of Zhang Taisheng in northern Jiangsu seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack on the 7th evening. The National Army in that city is currently counterattacking.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] The Third and Seventh Columns of the Communist army of Liu Bocheng in southwestern Shandong, after capturing Juye and Jiaxiang, advanced to attack Jinxiang, attempting to develop towards the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and threaten Xuzhou. The National Army stationed in Jinxiang once issued an alarm, but after a certain unit of the National Army arrived and launched a costly counterattack, the Communist army was defeated, Jinxiang was relieved, and the Communist army's attempt to peer southwards was thwarted. Currently, the Communist army in that area has retreated northwards, and its vanguard has reached the area between Fan County and Shou Zhang. It is also learned that the Communist army is actively operating along the old course of the Yellow River, apparently attempting to breach the dyke southwest of Juan County. Because the project to restore the dyke of the Yellow River at Huayuankou has been completed and the river water has returned to its old course, the Communist army may breach the opening southwest of Juan County, causing the Yellow River to flood southwestern Shandong and inundate the National Army in that area.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 9th] He Long led more than 15,000 Communist troops, recently departed from Dezhou via Ling County and Deping, heading southeast, claiming that they would attack Jinan. Furthermore, the Second, Third, Fifth, and Sixth Columns of Liu Bocheng's Communist army, totaling more than 50,000 men, together with the forces of Yang Yong, plan to launch a widespread offensive in western Shandong.

### Discussing the Yellow River Damming and Restoration Problem; Dong Biwu Visits Egerton; Headwaters of the Old Course Pass Kaifeng and Flow East

[By the Central Agency in this city] CCP representative Dong Biwu visited General Egerton, head of the UNRRA branch office, at nine o'clock yesterday morning after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to discuss the Yellow River damming and restoration problem, and did not leave until around twelve o'clock. The two sides continued to hold talks in the afternoon. The formal meeting will have to wait until the arrival of Huo Baoshu, director of the Executive Yuan, and Todd, chief engineer, in Shanghai?

In addition to Egerton and Dong, those who participated in the talks yesterday included Davis, Bokennan, and Hansen from UNRRA, and Lin Zhong, Zhao Mingfu, Wang Xiaoyi, and Cheng Run from the CCP side. During the meeting, Dong Biwu raised two points of opinion and requested (1) to stop damming the opening (2) to speed up the dike restoration project. General Egerton believed that he could be responsible for informing the Huayuankou Engineering Office to stop releasing water, but the cessation of damming and dike restoration would have to be jointly considered with the government and the relevant mine bureaus.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th] After the CCP raised objections to the Huayuankou diversion channel releasing water, the Damming and Restoration Bureau, in order to make the actual situation of the CCP obstructing the damming more clear to all parties, consultant Todd went to Shanghai to specially meet with Guan Zhenxing, the director of the engineering office sent by UNRRA, and went to Beijing to report to the Water Conservancy Commission separately.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 8th] After the old course of the Yellow River was diverted, it reached Huanggangkou at twelve o'clock noon on the 3rd, crossed the Bianxin Railway line at 6:20 a.m. on the 4th, and crossed the Bianxin Highway at 6:40 a.m. At 2:30 p.m. on the 5th, it flowed to Nanchen Village, eight li east of Chenqiao on the north bank, with an average flow rate of a little more than one li per hour. At 10 p.m. on the 5th, it flowed to Fuyin Temple, about ten li northwest of Sao Tong. At 8 a.m. on the 6th, it flowed three li past Junheji (thirteen li northeast of Sao Tong), with a water width of 25 meters and a depth of about 2 centimeters, and a faster speed. At 2 p.m. on the 6th, it flowed to Guantai, with a water width of about 50 meters and a depth of about 2 meters, and a speed slightly slower than walking. After the headwaters passed, the water flow gradually became turbulent. In the Fuyin Temple area, the water is currently 80 meters wide and 1 meter deep.

### Zhou Enlai's Unreasonable Demands

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Yan'an on the 8th: Zhou Enlai issued a serious statement on the Yellow River damming problem.

It is also required that the dangerous sections be rectified and straightened during dike restoration, and that the opening can only be dammed and water released after the entire project is completed.

### More Than 100,000 Opium Addicts in Guangdong Province
Central Government Sends Personnel to Supervise Prohibition

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] Zhu Weizhen, special envoy for the Guangdong-Fujian area prohibition, recently told reporters that Guangdong Province was the earliest place for opium to be imported, and was later influenced by the enemy and puppet's policies of poisoning the people, resulting in a deep-rooted problem of opium. According to investigations, there are 34 counties in the province that grow opium, and there are more than 100,000 opium addicts in the entire province. In Guangzhou City alone, there are more than 20,000. In the past, Guangdong Province also had opium prohibition plans, but they were mostly not handled in accordance with central government laws and regulations, resulting in no results. Therefore, the central government specially sent Zhu to Guangdong to supervise. According to Zhu, opium in the Guangdong area will be completely cleared within one year.

### Hong Kong Deputy Police Superintendent Shoots and Wounds Our Shepherd Boy While Hunting
Wang Lai's Father Appeals for Assistance

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 9th] On December 26, Hong Kong Deputy Police Superintendent Lucas Khan went hunting near Zongling in the New Territories and fired a shot into the jungle.

According to Lucas Khan, the incident was purely an accident. He fired a shot into the jungle that day, but only learned of the accidental shooting of the shepherd boy when he returned to the police station.

### UNRRA Supplies Awaiting Shipment to China Valued at Over $200 Million USD; Rooks Report Says Shipments Will Be Expedited

[US News Agency, Washington, 8th] UNRRA Director General Major General Rooks issued a report today, stating that as of January 1, UNRRA had shipped 19,257,970 tons of supplies, valued at approximately $2,281,759,000 USD, completing 78% of the entire plan. In order to end UNRRA as soon as possible, the remaining 6 million tons (valued at approximately $661,949,000 USD) of supplies will be shipped in the near future. Among the supplies not yet shipped, China will receive $269,119,000 USD, the Philippines $4,525,000 USD, and Korea $822,000 USD.

Regarding the China portion, Rooks said: "Forty percent of the supplies we have not yet shipped will be shipped to China, as only half of the supplies to China have been shipped. Our work in China started a few months later than in Europe. In addition, the congestion at Chinese ports forced us to suspend shipments (except for food), which was also one of the reasons for the delay. The steps implemented in July were very effective, and most of the embargo on supplies has been lifted. What has not been shipped is limited to items that are not easily distributed. We have provided more than 200 landing craft and other ships to the Chinese authorities, making the distribution work smoother. We will continue to provide China with 60 ships.

At the beginning, UNRRA's work in China was extremely difficult, due to the vastness of the area, the difficulty of transportation, and China's own administrative problems. UNRRA's distribution of supplies is equal to all, and does not allow any discrimination based on race or political views. In order to comply with this policy, UNRRA has tried to ship supplies to Communist areas in a fair proportion. However, due to the civil war, these efforts have not been effective. UNRRA is now doubling its efforts, hoping to reach an agreement with the KMT and the CCP so that a large amount of supplies can be shipped to Communist areas. According to recent reports, this effort has achieved considerable success.

UNRRA's food relief provides great assistance to the famines in the disaster areas of China, despite the difficulties of transportation. UNRRA's post-war assistance provides assistance to Chinese industry, and UNRRA's technical personnel are also of great help to the restoration of Chinese industry and agriculture. UNRRA has made great contributions to the reconstruction of railways and inland waterways. Although UNRRA's work is now focused on post-war recovery, it is hoped that under a greater plan, the effects of its current unfinished work will exceed 1946."

Editorial

### Expectations for Marshal Ma's Appointment as Secretary of State

The news of Marshal Marshall's return to the country to serve as Secretary of State has been well received by both the Chinese and American governments and the public. The US Senate unanimously approved it on the 8th, with not a single dissenting vote, which is a rare phenomenon in American political history. The new Senate President Vandenberg and the former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Connally jointly drafted a bipartisan American foreign policy with Byrnes. They praised Byrnes's achievements over the past year and a half. However, they all believe that Marshall is the most suitable candidate to take on the role of Secretary of State. Time magazine praised Byrnes as a great man of 1946, and Marshall is truly a great figure in modern American history. It is certainly regrettable that Marshall was unable to accomplish his mission in China and had to leave China to serve as Secretary of State. However, this does not mean that Marshall will no longer be involved in Chinese politics. Moreover, we believe that after Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, there will be greater hope for accelerating the completion of his unfinished great cause in China.

Marshall was ordered by President Truman to be an envoy to China to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It has been exactly eleven months. During this period, Marshall has been in constant contact with all parties and has silently observed the evolution of the situation in China and the Far East. He not only knows the political situation in China and the common wishes of the 450 million people of the country, but also understands the crux of the Far Eastern situation. With his extraordinary wisdom and his victorious strategies, he failed to accomplish his mission of mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and bringing peace to China. This cannot be regarded as Marshall's personal failure. We have studied the reasons why the internal strife in China has not stopped. There are many factors. Marshall's memorandum to the US State Department before leaving China has already explained it in detail. However, we always believe that the nature of the China problem is not simple, but a very complex and subtle problem. It is inevitable that the authority of the President's special envoy alone to seek a solution to the China problem will be exhausted and cannot be planned in a comprehensive manner to seek a fundamental solution. However, after Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, American foreign policy will be completely under his control. Marshall will be able to use it freely, and there will be many conveniences for solving the China problem. Although Marshall himself is not in China, Ambassador Stuart is in China and can continue to mediate. There are rumors that Ambassador Stuart is about to resign. We do not believe it because Ambassador Stuart's mission to China was the result of Marshall's recommendation to the President. His main task is to assist Marshall in carrying out mediation work. He has made great contributions to Marshall's understanding of China. Now that Marshall still wants to solve the China problem, he cannot be without Ambassador Stuart's assistance. Only one person in the United States can preside over the major policy direction, and one person in China can mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, can there be hope of success.

We have always believed that the China problem is a part of the Far East problem. The clarification of the Far Eastern situation will be of great benefit to the solution of the China problem. Looking back and looking ahead, it is not difficult to prove that since the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the Second United Nations General Assembly have successively closed, European international politics has achieved a peaceful trend, and there have also been signs of improvement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, the Far Eastern situation is still unclear, and the improvement of US-Soviet relations has not yet materialized. The world's attention will be focused on the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference in March this year, and everyone has great hopes. British Army Chief of Staff Montgomery is currently visiting senior Soviet military and political officials in Moscow, and the atmosphere between Britain and the Soviet Union has greatly eased. Former Labor Party Chairman Laski, who visited the Soviet Union, also declared that the Soviet Union does have peaceful intentions. Based on this, it is not difficult to dispel the suspicions between Britain and the Soviet Union. As for between the United States and the Soviet Union, President Truman also spoke of US-Soviet cooperation in his message to the Eightieth Congress. After Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, he will naturally inherit the President's will and try to expand the achievements of the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the Second United Nations General Assembly to seek an improvement in US-Soviet relations. We still remember that during the war, Marshall, in his capacity as the US Chief of Staff, had frequent contacts with senior Soviet military and political officials. When the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Potsdam, Marshall personally met with Marshal Stalin. Therefore, with Marshall's past experience and his feelings for the Soviet Union, it is not difficult to improve the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Moreover, when Marshall was in China, he silently observed the core issues of the Far Eastern situation and paid attention to the movements of the Soviet Union at all times. As the saying goes, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle," which has always been Marshall's motto. Therefore, we believe that the first step Marshall will take in diplomacy after taking office will be to try to improve US-Soviet relations.

As for the American policy toward China, there will be no major changes. However, Marshall knows the national conditions of China, understands the wishes of the people of the whole country, and is very clear about what China urgently needs at the moment. In short, it is nothing more than the eight characters "peace, unity, democracy, and nation-building." "Peace and unity" still require the efforts of all parties to strive for, while "democracy and nation-building" have taken their first major step. A practical and feasible democratic constitution has been passed by the National Assembly and promulgated by the government, and will be implemented from December 25 this year. Although it is still the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, the Kuomintang's period of political tutelage can be regarded as having become a thing of the past. Moreover, expanding the foundation of the government and recruiting representatives of various parties and social elites to participate will soon be realized. If the United States wants to help China build a country and revive, then it is time to provide active material assistance.

In his memorandum to the State Department, Marshall also set out the economic situation in China, which has been destroyed by the Communist Party and has fallen into a very serious situation. If the United States provides material assistance at this time, it will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. What China urgently needs at the moment is to restore the national transportation system and to revitalize industry and commerce. The completion of these two ends depends on the assistance of friendly countries. Therefore, we hope that the US authorities do not have to wait until peace is truly restored. At this moment, it can assist China in moving towards the bright road of nation-building. We believe that Marshall can understand this feeling that we have.

In short, after Marshall returns to the country to take office, the focus of American foreign policy will be concentrated on the Far East. We hope that Marshall will have a long-term vision and, on the one hand, improve US-Soviet relations, restore the spirit of mutual trust and mutual assistance during the war, and jointly devote himself to the creation of peace, so that the Far Eastern situation can also be clarified. On the other hand, he will actively assist China in laying the foundation for China's democratic nation-building. By taking these two-pronged approach, we will surely be able to seek a fundamental solution to the China problem in order to accomplish Marshall's unfinished great cause in China.

### How to Reorganize Personnel

Personnel administration is one of the most unsatisfactory problems at present. Generally speaking, its weaknesses are four: first, there are too many staff members; second, the general level is too low; third, the salaries are too low; fourth, the turnover rate is too high; fifth, the efficiency is too poor. And these weaknesses are mostly mutually causal. Because the salary is too low, it is impossible to find suitable talents, so the level is low. Because the level is low, the efficiency is poor, and the number of staff members cannot be too many. Because the efficiency is poor, it is necessary to adjust it from time to time, so the turnover rate is high, and the staff members have no guarantee.

The key to the problem lies in the fact that the salary is too low and the position is too insecure. However, in addition to these two reasons, there are many objective conditions that can contribute to the complexity and chaos of personnel. One is too much formalism. For example, if you want to promote a certain system, you don't ask about the actual situation, you just want to be neat and unified, and promote it uniformly in order to achieve consistency. Suppose there is a certain agency. Including the director and the staff members, there are only two staff members in total, but because it is also considered an agency, according to the regulations, the accounting agency must send an accountant. Before the military uprising, the construction funds of a certain county were only more than 10,000 yuan, but a construction bureau had to be established. According to this method, how can there not be more redundant personnel? How can the number of staff members not be large?

The second is too many tricks. As long as the name is novel and in line with the times, no matter what the financial conditions are, it will be copied out. If anyone holds a different opinion, he will be given the crime of destruction or devastation, so that he has nothing to say. Therefore, all kinds of signs can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys, and even in remote rural areas. Of course, there are many of them that are just half-filled and half-hungry, raising a few idlers, which is actually not a few.

Third, there are too many supervisors and ordering agencies. Each is based on its own duties, each is in charge of its own scene, and they go their separate ways and issue orders indiscriminately to show their efforts. The lower-level agencies dare not fail to comply with them because of their position. As a result, there are more and more signs, and more and more people are used. As for whether the funding is available and how the performance is, that is another matter. It is good to make a few forms and report a few numbers. There is always a way. Some people think that all agencies now have central tasks, and this situation should be able to be improved. However, they do not know that those competent authorities have each ordered their competent matters to be included in the central work. We know that in many places, although the finance is nominally unified revenue and expenditure, in fact, there are clear boundaries between this territory and that territory. Any money designated for buying salt is definitely not allowed to buy oil. The so-called central work is only paid special attention to when handling it. In fact, it is still not easy to see a comprehensive plan and weigh the urgency. Therefore, redundant agencies and redundant personnel are still impossible to cut.

Therefore, if we really want to cut redundant personnel and eliminate waste, we believe that first, the local competent officials must be able to grasp the overall situation, use their subjective judgment to distinguish the urgency, and formulate appropriate administrative policies. Do not deal with it casually, creating a chaotic situation. Second, the number of staff members and Xie Ge in each agency must have considerable flexibility, so that the responsible personnel can consider the situation and make practical and appropriate decisions. Do not follow the same pattern, be too rigid, so that usable people cannot be used, and people who must be used cannot be used. We believe that this is the necessary way to reorganize personnel.

### International Food Conference Allocates Rice; We Receive More Than 240,000 Tons; Only 35 Percent of the Requested Amount

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] The International Emergency Food Conference today allocated 245,000 metric tons of rice to China for the first half of 1947, which is only 35% of China's request for 800,000 tons. The conference said that during that period, the supply of rice was only enough to meet 35% of the requests of various countries and countries in urgent need. Chen Zhimai, the Chinese representative to the conference, declared that of the rice allocated to China, 100,000 tons would be taken from Siam, 33,000 tons would be taken from Vietnam, 100,000 tons would be taken from Burma, and 12,000 tons would be taken from the United States. The conference also allowed Chinese rice merchants in Siam to continue to ship rice to China, with the following percentages allocated in the total amount: If the rice shipped from Siam since last October exceeds 50,000 tons, then 5% is allocated, 6% if it exceeds 60,000 tons, 7% if it exceeds 80,000 tons, and 8% if it exceeds 100,000 tons. Chen Zhimai said that China can obtain another 24,000 tons of rice within the first three months, which is repaid by the United Kingdom. During these six months, China can allocate a large amount of wheat and flour.

### Clearing Up Illegal Disposal of Land in Northern Jiangsu; Land Over 80 Mu is Nationalized; The Provincial Government Makes Special Changes to Adapt to the Facts

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] Cheng Zimin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Bureau, returned to the province after inspecting Northern Jiangsu. According to him, the clearing of land in the Northern Jiangsu Pacification District, according to the central government's regulations, all land illegally disposed of by the Communist Army is nationalized. However, after the provincial government officials returned from inspecting the recovered area, they felt that such measures were also difficult in practice. Therefore, after the provincial government approved, the excess part of those with more than 80 mu should be nationalized, and then redistributed to farmers without land. As for the current clearing of land in the Northern Jiangsu Pacification District, it has already begun, and Dongtai Huangqiao Duocheng Gaoyou area has been designated as an experimental area to see how good its future results are before making a decision. He also informed that the bureau plans to restore the original establishment of the Zhengju Administration Bureaus in Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Songjiang, and Wujin counties first, but it has not yet been approved by the provincial government meeting, and the latest will not exceed three months. In addition, Xuzhou, Nantong, and Jiangdu counties in Northern Jiangsu must also start to handle the registration of urban areas, and it is also planned to concentrate efforts to complete the land registration clearing of Chuansha Juxian Jiading four counties in Shanghai this year, and Zhenjiang plans to complete the clearing of 1 million mu of strictly controlled land.

### Many Labor-Capital Disputes in Hangzhou

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 9th] As the old lunar year is approaching, labor-capital disputes in Hangzhou are becoming more and more serious.

In today's economic straits of industry and commerce, Laozi has nothing to do. The unrest in society cannot be avoided even in paradise.

### Repairing the Jiangnan Highways - Progressing Step by Step

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] The highways in various parts of Jiangnan were severely damaged during the war, and few have been repaired to date.

### Impersonation and Extortion Leading to Murder - Perpetrators to Face Military Tribunal

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] In Cai Hui River Head Township, the home of Hou Mingxin was invaded on the evening of the 7th by ruffian Shao He and accomplices posing as soldiers, who, under the pretext of searching for opium, attempted to extort 2 million yuan.

### Two Cases of Monstrous Births

[Our Baoshan Dispatch] In Xiaochujia Village, a farmer named Xu Xichang's wife, Ju Yuying, was pregnant for thirteen full months. Around 11:30 pm on the 7th, she gave birth to a child.

There was a small hole the size of a mung bean on the forehead, with signs of breathing. Xu, thinking it was a monster, prepared to throw it into the river, but was stopped by his father. People from all around heard of this and braved the rain to flock to see it. The child died of exhaustion at 10 am the next morning.

[Our Su County Dispatch] Zhang Xueli'an, a resident of Zhang Huang Village in Ji Kou Township, felt a sudden abdominal pain on New Year's Eve while returning to Ningdu, and subsequently gave birth to a mass of flesh, the size of a bowl.

### Suzhou Banks to Aid Industry and Commerce - Establishing an Emergency Loan Consortium - Allocation of Interest Rates and Underwriting Methods Yet to Be Agreed Upon

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] In light of the crisis in local industry and commerce, which is as imminent as fire singeing one's eyebrows, the Suzhou government, despite the County Chamber of Commerce's several desperate pleas for loans, has seen no concrete results, leading to delays and potentially disastrous consequences. Therefore, on the 9th, the County Government convened a meeting of the County Chamber of Commerce and representatives from various state-owned, commercial, and private banks to discuss aid to industry and commerce. Attendees were extremely enthusiastic. First, Magistrate Shen reported on the significance of convening the meeting.

### Hao County Party, Government, and Military Joint Meeting

Resolved to Form City Defense Teams and Village Clearing Teams

### Bengbu's Traitor Trials - 270 Cases Concluded

[Our Bengbu Dispatch] Since the victory, the traitor trials in this area, according to recent statistics from the First Branch of the Anhui Higher Court, from New Year's Day last year to the end of December, have received a total of 411 cases of traitors, of which 270 have been concluded, and 141 have not been concluded. Among those that have been concluded, only Ni Daolang, the former Governor of Anhui Province, was sentenced to death. According to Xu Jiaguan, the President of the First Branch of the Higher Court, although the major traitor Ni Daolang has been sentenced to death, according to regulations, it must be submitted to the Supreme Court for a retrial, which has not yet been concluded. Tang Shaohou, the former Director of the Finance Department, has a complicated case, [illegible], [illegible], [illegible], [illegible], [illegible] After the sentence, the Red Swastika Society and people involved in the Tong Zhi case argued that although Ni had communicated with the enemy and betrayed the country during the period when Bengbu was captured, he was a member of the Taoist sect, and his philosophy was kindness. Therefore, he did not commit any major evils, and many people interceded on his behalf to reduce the sentence. The Supreme Court's delay in sentencing may be due to this. Judging from the current situation, it is possible that Ni may have his sentence reduced to life imprisonment.

### Jiaxing County Political Conference - Decided to Use Grain

### Lu'an County Council - Reviewing the County-Level Budget

[Our Lu'an Report] The County Council convened a temporary meeting of councilors from various townships to review the county budget for the 36th year. Chairman Pan presided over the meeting. The total county revenue was reviewed as 1,681,264,000 yuan. The education sector, in accordance with provincial regulations, accounted for 30%, or 525,000,000 yuan, plus an additional 20,000,000 yuan as a subsidy for school maintenance expenses. Regarding the salaries of county-level personnel, it was decided that salaries would be increased by a factor of 360, and living subsidies would be 60,000 yuan. The salaries of township-level personnel would be increased by a factor of 240, and living subsidies would be 35,000 yuan. The salaries of village-level personnel would be increased by a factor of 160, and living subsidies would be 25,000 yuan. Public expenses would be increased by a factor of 3. Regarding local historical and cultural work, the organization of the Historical and Cultural Committee should be strengthened, with two full-time group leaders, eight members, and three employees to facilitate the work. Regarding loans for college students, the first third plenary session of the Council had previously resolved to allocate 10 million yuan in US dollar bonds as a fund to generate interest. However, these bonds have not yet been cashed, and the current loan is not available. It was decided that the full amount of 6 million yuan in compensation in arrears from former director Wu Huaide of the field management office should be used. Therefore, the total county revenue is 1,683,640,000 yuan, with a balanced budget. The county government has reported the county budget to the provincial government for approval.

Please Restore the Telegram Distribution Offices

It has been more than a year since the victory, and everything should be on the path to reconstruction. But looking at the telegrams, there is always a large crowd of people lined up in front of the telegram office, and it is even more crowded inside. Once, I tried to send a telegram to Zhengzhou, and after waiting in line from 3:00 PM, I still couldn't get to the window by nightfall. It wasn't until the next morning that I was able to send it. What if someone had a sudden illness and needed to call a doctor or family from another city? Wouldn't that be a disaster?

If you take a chance and think you can send the telegram earlier by going to the various receiving offices, they either tell you to go to the main office or say that they don't accept telegrams here. I don't know what the point of establishing these receiving offices is!

Not moving forward but at least not moving backward is acceptable (although telephone reception and transmission are also hindered). To avoid this congestion, it is best to restore telegram reception at the distribution offices, so that they are worthy of their name. (Zhang Chengyu)

Questions Regarding Combined Property Tax Calculation

Recently, the Finance Bureau sent property tax and municipal tax payment forms, which I believe are extremely unfair. I live in Jingyuan, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road. There are 34 buildings in this lane, which the Finance Bureau has classified as Grade C. In the 26th year of the Republic, the rental value of each building was estimated at 528 yuan. I live in buildings 5 and 6 in Jingyuan, and each building should pay 26,400 yuan in autumn property tax and municipal construction tax. However, the autumn property tax and municipal tax payment forms issued by the Finance Bureau combine the rental values of the two buildings and forcibly classify them as Grade B, ordering me to pay 79,200 yuan, which unfairly increases my burden. I really cannot accept this. Furthermore, the Finance Bureau's property tax forms for the winter of last year and the spring and summer of this year were calculated separately for buildings 5 and 6, in two copies, and were not combined. This can be used as evidence. I specially urge the Finance Bureau to review this and grant a correction. (Wang Bingzheng)

A Primary School Teacher's Heartbreaking Words

I am a teacher at a municipal central primary school, with a monthly salary of 200,000 yuan. I have to support a family of five. I have an elderly mother with white hair, and young children below me. Most of my usual expenses are covered by borrowing from relatives and friends, or selling broken items from my home to get by. Now the weather is getting cold. When I get up in the morning, the frost on the roof tiles has thickened a lot, but we are still wearing these thin, tattered old cotton clothes. All the belongings at home have been sold out, and I am too ashamed to go to relatives and friends to borrow again. My mother has caught a cold and is coughing, and the children are shrinking on the bed all day because of the cold. When I hear my mother's cough and see my children shivering, I feel heartbroken! People's hearts are made of flesh. How can I not feel pain?

I know that the municipal government also has its own difficulties, but I am a poor teacher. I don't have any extravagant desires. I only ask the authorities to allow us poor teachers to get through the winter. (A Primary School Teacher)

Concerns About a Rubber Factory in the Alley

I live in Lane 51, Jiaozhou Road, West Shanghai. Next door is a small rubber factory, and the loud noise of the machines continues all night, disturbing our sleep. I am even more concerned that rubber products are extremely flammable. Not long ago, a report stated that the Xin Rubber Factory in Panjiaku was burned for several hours due to a fire in the neighborhood, and it was difficult to extinguish. Fortunately, it was located in a remote area, and there were few consequences. It is originally forbidden by the authorities to open factories in residential areas, but now a highly flammable rubber factory is located in a densely populated and narrow street. If something unfortunate happens in this cold winter, the tragic situation of the residents in the multi-story buildings is unimaginable. This concerns public safety. I am personally experiencing it, and I feel a sense of danger, so I dare not remain silent. I hope the authorities will pay attention to it and not say that I did not speak up sooner. (Yong)

### Marshall to Succeed as Secretary of State - US Senate Unanimously Approves - To Create World Peace and Complete Byrnes' Unfinished Work - Maintain "Firm" Principles in Diplomacy with the Soviet Union

[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] The US Senate today unanimously approved the appointment of General Marshall as Secretary of State. During the session, Senator Vandenberg praised both Marshall and Byrnes, saying that the Senate should act quickly to show the world that "the unity and continuity of US foreign policy remain unchanged." The date for the new Secretary of State to take office has not yet been decided, but Byrnes will likely remain in office temporarily until Marshall returns to the United States. Although Byrnes' resignation has caused some surprise, his desire to leave due to physical exhaustion has long been known. Byrnes' resignation is intended to allow him to complete the peace treaties with the five satellite nations. The news of Byrnes' resignation was originally scheduled to be announced in a few days, but it was announced earlier because the news had already been leaked. According to White House Press Secretary Ross, Marshall and Byrnes reached an understanding several months ago that Marshall would take over after Byrnes' resignation. Observers believe that the change in Secretary of State will not affect the bipartisan policy pursued by Byrnes.

[Reuter, Washington, 8th] Marshall's appointment as US Secretary of State will undoubtedly continue Byrnes' foreign policy and maintain the same "firm" approach towards the Soviet Union. Diplomatic and congressional leaders alike believe that Marshall will continue to build world peace to complete Byrnes' unfinished work. Marshall's first major task will be to use the next few weeks to intensify efforts in preparation for attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in March to discuss the German and Austrian peace treaties.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] Diplomatic circles here believe that the reason for Byrnes' resignation is that the United States will change its policy towards the Soviet Union, but American foreign policy will not abandon its basic principles of "prudence and firmness," nor will it become more tough or subtle. The essence will remain the same, with only slight modifications in degree. It is said that Byrnes believed that if the system of the Paris Conference could be maintained, the fundamental differences of opinion between the United States and the Soviet Union could eventually be gradually eliminated. Byrnes was skilled in this approach, often using diplomatic delaying tactics in order to gradually achieve America's goals. It is said that Marshall will now change his methods, forcing a showdown and clearly abandoning the "needle prick" strategy adopted by Byrnes. According to observers here, although the Moscow Conference only has the overall peace treaty on the agenda, if Marshall proposes a broad review of the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union at that time, the Soviet Union will not refuse. However, it is still too early to guess whether this will produce concrete results.

### Large-Scale Personnel Changes Expected Within the State Department - Pinko Elements to Be Purged

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] After Marshall officially succeeds Byrnes as Secretary of State, there will be large-scale personnel changes among senior officials of the State Department and US diplomatic representatives. It is rumored that General Marshall intends to send former Commander of the US Forces in China, General Albert Wedemeyer, as Ambassador to China to replace John Leighton Stuart. Senior State Department officials who are expected to resign include Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, Roosevelt's brain truster Byrnes, and Benton, who is responsible for US international propaganda. Some observers say that Byrnes has been away from Washington for too long, so the internal organization of the State Department has become lax. After Marshall takes office, he should thoroughly reorganize and eliminate those with communist and far-left leanings. It is expected that there will be more military personnel entering the diplomatic field than before. Regarding the purging of pro-communist and far-left elements, the Republican-controlled Congress has long been calling for this. As for the problems that Marshall will face in the future, in addition to the various negotiations on the Four-Power talks, there are also military and diplomatic issues such as the joint defense treaty in the Western Hemisphere, the standardization of armaments with Britain and other countries, and the long-term occupation of the former Japanese islands in the Pacific.

### US Secretary of the Army Broadcast - Japan No Longer Poses a Threat to the US

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 9th Broadcast: US Secretary of the Army Patterson stated emphatically in a special broadcast today that Japan no longer has a navy, army, or air force, and is definitely unable to attack the United States again. He also pointed out that the United States is eager to expedite the repatriation of Japanese from the Soviet Union and Soviet-controlled areas so that they can have the opportunity to learn democracy and make their country self-sufficient as soon as possible.

### Marshall's Appointment as Secretary of State - Reactions in European Countries

[United Press, London, 8th] The resignation of US Secretary of State Byrnes has been met with surprise and regret in various European countries, and unanimous praise for Marshall's succession. A British Foreign Office spokesman unconditionally expressed support for Marshall's leadership of US foreign policy. Moscow remained silent, but the Soviet-controlled newspapers in Berlin stated that Marshall would cooperate more closely with the Soviet Union. Some European newspapers believe that Marshall's appointment as US Secretary of State shows that the United States is paying attention to the situation in the Far East. London diplomatic observers say that the Soviet reaction will likely depend on Marshall's success in mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] Furthermore, diplomatic circles here refuse to speculate on Marshall's future attitude towards the Soviet Union, only saying that Marshall had deep personal friendships with Stalin and other senior Soviet generals during the war. When the three giants of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Potsdam in 1945, Stalin gave Marshall a signed album and asked him to sign it in his own handwriting for remembrance. Voroshilov and Gromyko also presented Marshall with rare gifts such as Soviet caviar and vodka.

### Foreign Ministers Conference - Not to Be Postponed

Soviet Authorities Guarantee Freedom of the Press

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] A US State Department spokesman said today that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to be held in Moscow in March and has never considered postponing it. Marshal Marshall's appointment as Secretary of State will not cause the conference to be delayed. At the same time, Byrnes will expand the performance of the duties of Secretary of State to await Marshall's takeover.

[United Press, New York, 8th] United Press Moscow reported that editor Leonard Rieser telegraphed that the Soviet Union has guaranteed broad freedom of news coverage at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Moscow in March. On this basis, it would appear that news policies in the Soviet Union will be greatly modified.

### Truman Submits Economic Report to Congress - President's Tone Quite Optimistic

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman submitted a statement to Congress today saying: If the United States cannot fulfill its promise to reduce tariffs, it will have a far-reaching impact on world politics and the establishment of hope. The country has the greatest production, employment, and purchasing power, so it should not fear foreign competition, but should promote plans to achieve mutual reduction of trade barriers. The International Trade Organization initiated by the United States is the most important step in rebuilding large-scale foreign trade on a sound basis. However, whether most other countries are willing to join this organization largely depends on our attitude in this year's reciprocal tariff negotiations. The government has the power to reduce current tariff rates by 50% without seeking congressional approval.

International Discussion on Reducing Tariffs

The United States has invited 18 other countries to hold a meeting in Geneva in April this year to discuss the same reduction of tariffs and the elimination of other trade restrictions. If we cannot fulfill our responsibility to place international economic relations on a sound basis, some countries will seem to be forced to increase their own control, and this development will inevitably divide the world into separate trading blocs. The only way to maintain the prosperity of the United States in 1947 is to maintain current tax rates, raise minimum wages, improve social welfare, and maintain rent control. Reducing wartime income tax is not sound fiscal policy. The balance between real purchasing power and production capacity must be achieved by reducing prices.

Taxes Maintained at Current Standards

Taxes should be maintained at current standards. Sound public finance requires that government revenue exceed expenditure when there are many jobs and large total income. The tax burden is heavy and should be reduced as soon as possible, but when it is reduced in the future, it must be fair and equitably distributed.

The President's lengthy report began with an optimistic tone, saying that at the beginning of 1947, the strength and prosperity of the United States were unprecedented, and our hopes were never so clear. The American people should reject the idea of another depression.

### Soviet Chief of General Staff to Visit Britain and the United States

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 9th Broadcast: Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, Marshal Vasilevsky, has accepted invitations from US Chief of Staff Eisenhower and British Field Marshal Montgomery to visit military installations in Britain and the United States in the near future.

### Philippines to Establish National Defense Committee

President Roxas to Serve as Chairman

[Associated Press, Manila, 8th] President Roxas is about to issue an order to establish a National Defense Committee, with himself as chairman, to formulate the Philippines' comprehensive defense policy, including the issue of leasing bases to the United States. Any agreement that US Ambassador McNutt and Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino may reach will be reviewed by the National Defense Committee and then submitted to the Philippine Senate for discussion in the form of a treaty. US military advisor to the Philippines, Jones, and Philippine Deputy Chief of Staff, Shaker, are drafting a ten-year defense plan to deal with the latest developments in warfare and the strategies of the atomic age.

### Vietnamese Situation Remains Tense: France Conscripts New Soldiers, Moutet Advocates a Two-Pronged Approach of Politics and Military

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The Ministry of Defense today issued a communique stating that French defense officers, junior officers, and soldiers may be sent to the Far East, owing to developments in the Far East situation. At the same time, the age for voluntary conscription into the defense forces has been reduced from nineteen to eighteen years. Regulations for the conscription of general volunteers to serve in the Far East have also been amended to recruit a large number of experienced young men into the military. In addition, two battalions of veteran soldiers departed from Toulon for Vietnam today without delay.

[Reuters, Calcutta, 8th] French Overseas Colonial Minister Moutet arrived here today, returning from Vietnam. He plans to inspect French colonies near Calcutta and Madras. Mr. Moutet said that the Vietnam issue cannot be resolved solely by military force. A political solution can be achieved once the Viet Minh understand that the agreements previously reached between France and Viet Minh must be faithfully implemented by both sides. French policy remains unchanged. We still intend to maintain the autonomous government of Viet Minh and the autonomous government of Cochinchina, he said.

[Reuters, Hanoi, 8th] The Chinese, British, and American consuls there today walked to the Viet Minh defense line to demand assurances for the safety of 200 French civilians held as hostages. The outcome is not yet known. It is also reported that the Viet Minh intend to resume political activities, and if negotiations can be resumed, they can halt military activities.

[United Press, Hanoi, 9th] United Press monitored a broadcast from the Vietnam People's Republic radio station last night, containing statements about resisting to the end, even to "suicide." Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh broadcast a speech saying, "When our resistance is successful, we can drink to our hearts' content."

### King of Transjordan Braving Snow Arrives in Ankara

[United Press, Ankara, 8th] King Abdullah of Transjordan arrived here today in the heavy snow aboard the Turkish President's special car, with a grand welcoming ceremony.

### Full Text of Truman's Speech at the Joint Session of the U.S. Congress (Part II)

Restricting Monopolies

The second important issue I am pleased to discuss before you is the gradual concentration of economic power and the resulting threat to free competition in private enterprise. In 1941, the Temporary National Economic Committee completed a comprehensive investigation of the nation's economic activities. According to the committee's research, despite the implementation of anti-trust laws for a century, the most dangerous threat to our well-being is the accelerated concentration of power in the hands of a few and the patterned organization.

At that time, this long-standing trend of economic concentration accelerated even further. As a result, we now find that the extent to which the entire industry is controlled by a small number of organizations is far greater than in the past. These few large organizations can limit production for higher profits, thus reducing the number of employed workers and people's purchasing power.

In an effort to ensure that businesses have full and free competition opportunities, we will work to implement anti-trust laws. Congress can do much to cooperate and assist in this legislation.

It is not enough to simply strengthen the enforcement of laws governing business practices. In addition to enforcement, there must be active measures to assist new enterprises. Government assistance, research programs, and lending powers should be used to promote the growth of new businesses and new industries. Assisting small businesses is particularly important at this time. We should also pay special attention to the diversification of industry and the development of industrialized areas.

Housing Problem

The third major policy that is also very important to the national economy is an active encouragement of housing construction programs. The first federal program to alleviate the housing shortage for veterans was announced in February 1946. In 1946, housing units for one million families were under construction, and another 665,000 units were completed. The rate of expansion in the proposed area has broken all records.

In the coming year, the number of housing units will be close to the peak construction year of 1946, if not exceed it. The responsibility for delivering housing to veterans at reasonable compensation lies with private industry and labor. The government will continue to accelerate the circulation of important building materials, restrict non-residential construction, and provide financial assistance. Special emphasis will be given to stimulating the construction of rental housing and new types of housing.

To achieve the long-term goal of providing housing for everyone, housing legislation is urgently needed, similar to the non-partisan bill passed by Congress last year. At a minimum, such legislation should open the way to rebuild the destroyed areas of our cities and encourage private capital to invest billions of dollars in large-scale housing projects. Such legislation should provide for improving housing in rural areas and building 500,000 affordable public housing units in four years. The peacetime Federal Housing Agency should be authorized to ensure the effective use of our resources on the housing front.

Financial Affairs

The fourth major policy is related to balancing the budget. In such prosperous times as these, the federal government's budget should be balanced. If we want to handle public finances prudently, we must begin to reduce the public debt. The budget I will submit to you during this term will have some surplus. In the budget message, I will make various suggestions that will result in a larger surplus to be used for repaying the national debt. One of the proposals is that Congress should take early action to continue wartime tax rates in the next fiscal year, which will expire on June 30, 1947, under current law.

Expenditures on the war remain high. A considerable amount of money is needed to alleviate world famine and suffering. Assistance to veterans will continue. The current world situation still requires large military expenditures. The interest on the public debt and certain other expenses cannot be reduced.

For these reasons, I have had to practice austerity in the preparation of the budget. I hope that Congress will cooperate with me in every economic program.

Agricultural Problems

The fifth important policy concerns the welfare of farmers. In 1946, food production reached its peak. There are many of our grains that can be sold overseas without affecting our domestic market. But in the coming years, American agriculture will face the same dangers as after World War I.

We all remember the results. Amid declining demand and prices, agricultural products continued to increase, which was completely opposite to the situation in industry, where prices rose but production decreased. Once agricultural products are overproduced, disaster follows.

We must solve the problems that we could not solve after World War I. Existing laws will provide considerable stability to agricultural product prices in 1947 and 1948. We should use these two years to maintain and develop our markets to adapt to our tremendous productivity.

The purpose of these laws is to allow for an orderly adjustment from wartime to peacetime. The government's price support program is not intended to absorb the unlimited overproduction of a highly productive agriculture. We should not wait until the protection period expires; we should urgently lay the foundation for permanent rural welfare.

Farmers should have a fair income. We can often find ways for them to make good use of their new skills and better policies, so that they can expand their domestic and foreign markets and implement the goal of a balanced peacetime production, so that farmers and the government do not suffer unnecessary losses and expenses.

General Welfare

Among our national resources, none is more precious than the health of our people. A year ago, I expressed to Congress my views on a national health program. Congress has taken action on some of the proposals in this program, namely, proposals on mental health, maternal and child health, and hospital construction. I have asked Congress to complete the work it did last year and implement the most important recommendation in the program, which is to provide adequate medical treatment to all who need it. This supply is not charitable in nature, but is paid for from the funds obtained from the implementation of the program.

An administrative change will be of great help in further promoting our national programs for health, education, and welfare. I again recommend the establishment of a comprehensive welfare department.

Veterans

The fourteen million service members of World War II have now returned to civilian life. Most of them have settled down and are employed. The quick and successful completion of this adjustment has made a great contribution to both the service members and our economy.

With the assistance of the federal government, more than one million veterans have entered schools or acquired job skills. Thousands of injured and sick veterans receive daily medical and hospital treatment. The government has also guaranteed loans for about 500,000 veterans to purchase homes, farms, or start new businesses. Two million disabled or deceased veterans have received compensation. More than three million still hold government-issued life insurance policies. Seven million veterans have received unemployment benefits and other allowances.

In addition to severance pay, the implementation of the veteran program costs more than seven billion yuan each year, which is about one-fifth of our total federal budget. This is a veteran program that no country has ever had before and is far-reaching.

Except for a few minor adjustments, I believe that our veteran program is now complete. The success of this program will not be judged in the future by how many veterans have received financial assistance or by the amount of money we have spent. History will not judge us based on the amount of money we have spent, but on how well we have enabled our veterans to dedicate themselves to the greater contribution of the country. We should pay attention to this when considering any other legislative proposals.

Recently, we have seen many people in our country attack the individual constitutional rights of citizens, as a result of racial and religious prejudice. Many of our people are unable to enjoy the right to participate in elections for local and national civil servants. The freedom to participate in legal professions has been denied. The will to combat these evils should be in the heart of each of us.

As for the federal government, the Department of Justice is now carrying out this battle to the fullest extent. Although the Constitution prevents the federal government from maintaining peace in certain states, I do not believe that the current legislation reaches the limits of federal power to protect the public rights of the people. Therefore, I have established the President's Committee on Civil Rights by executive order to study and report on the entire issue of civil rights and to make recommendations to Congress. (End)

### Reducing Tax Rates on Entertainment, Banquets, and Hotels Approved After Review: Director of Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan Reports at Budget Meeting, Total Budget to Be Reduced by 30 Billion After Tax Cuts

[Our report] The main task of the second meeting of the Municipal Council is to review the municipal government's budget for the 36th year. The council's budget committee felt that the previous general meeting was too rushed and the budget review was not detailed enough, so this time it has added a special emphasis on review. The review meeting was held all day yesterday, starting from 9:30 in the morning and ending at 9:00 in the evening. The regular and temporary income and expenditure budgets of the eight bureaus of the municipal government, as well as the general affairs office and the civil affairs office, were reviewed throughout the day. Relevant bureau chiefs attended to explain.

Yesterday, when the budget meeting reviewed the budgets of various bureaus, special attention was paid to the administrative expenses of each bureau, in addition to investigating the number of employees, and inquiring in detail about the vehicles equipped by each bureau. The committee stated that it hoped that each bureau could reduce expenses as much as possible to reduce the burden on citizens.

[Another report] Gu Chunfan, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, attended the review meeting of the Budget Committee of the Municipal Council yesterday and reported that the city's hotel tax was originally levied at 20%, but now it has been reduced to 5% in accordance with central government regulations, which will reduce the originally budgeted 8.4 billion yuan for this year by 6.3 billion yuan. The entertainment tax, which was originally 40%, will also be reduced to 25%, which will reduce the originally budgeted 207 billion yuan by 70%. The drama tax is planned to be reduced to 15%, but it still needs to be submitted to the central government for approval. The starting point for the banquet tax was previously set at 3,000 yuan, but it has now been changed to 5,000 yuan, but both Chinese and Western cuisine are treated the same. Restaurants with music and dancing are levied at the entertainment tax rate of 25%, while others are divided into two grades, A and B, with grade A being levied at 20% and grade B at 10%. According to current tax collection, 60% of the banquet tax is collected from more than 70 restaurants, so there is no impact, but 40% is collected from small restaurants in grade B, so this will be reduced by half again, reducing 5 billion yuan. After the use of license tax is levied in accordance with central government regulations, it will be reduced by 2.6 billion yuan. After the reduction of the above tax collections, the total budget will be reduced by approximately 30 billion yuan. If the municipal government's newly listed labor substitute fee of 40 billion yuan cannot be approved by the general assembly, then the total budget for the 36th year will be reduced by at least 70 billion yuan, which accounts for about one-third of the total.

Director Gu also explained that the business tax is generally considered to be too low, but in reality, it cannot be increased any further. After the central government stipulated eight special commodity taxes, the business tax can no longer be collected. The Finance Bureau, based on the 5,000 households collected by the Direct Tax Bureau as a standard, found that 7,500 households should be collected, but only 42,000 households have declared. Most of these 7,500 households are vendors, and the Finance Bureau has not urged them to pay taxes out of consideration for the burden on small vendors. At the same time, the business tax is not entirely based on business income, but on commissions and capital, so although 28 billion yuan is included in the budget, it cannot actually be collected. Regarding the house tax, since the central government already has laws and regulations, this city can follow them, but the central government has previously been asked to approve the collection in accordance with the current method, but there has been no reply to date. The slaughter tax stipulates that the weight of each pig is uniformly calculated at 80 catties. The bureau has conducted a detailed investigation, and this standard is indeed reasonable. The budgeted income for the business license tax is 900 million yuan, which may be increased, but it is difficult to estimate and requires further study.

### Health Committee Review Meeting

[Our report] The Health Committee held a review meeting at Xingzhong School yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss proposals related to health. The meeting was chaired by Chen Cunren. The results of the review were as follows: (1) The mayor submitted a proposal for the municipal government to organize health insurance for 100,000 workers. The resolution was passed in principle, but in order to suit the living habits of the workers, both Chinese and Western medicine should be adopted, and there should be no bias towards Western medicine.

[Our report] When the Finance Committee review meeting was in progress, five representatives from the Hotel Industry Association came to the meeting to petition, stating that the 20% hotel tax levied on room rates was unbearable and appealed to stop the collection to relieve the people's difficulties. The meeting sent Senators Lu Shidao and Wang Weiyin to meet with them. This case was listed on the agenda, so after a heated discussion, it was resolved to collect 5% of the special tax rate in accordance with central government regulations to live up to the people's expectations. In addition, the theater industry, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the wine and food industry, and other eight groups petitioned to reduce the banquet and entertainment tax, and the municipal government submitted a proposal for the central government to revise the new law on banquet and entertainment tax and propose supplementary measures for public discussion.

### Thorough Investigation of Aircraft Accident Case: Three Senators Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday

[Our Newspaper News] In order to thoroughly investigate the causes of the recent aircraft accidents of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, the Resident Committee of the National Senate has specially dispatched Senators Yin Shuxian, Zheng Kuiyi, and Jiang Yong to Shanghai. The three gentlemen departed from Beijing by overnight train the night before and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In the afternoon, they invited Dai Anguo, the Director-General, and Zuo Jipeng, the Deputy Director-General of the Civil Aviation Administration, to hold a meeting. Director-General Dai reported on the circumstances of the three aircraft accidents on Christmas Day (Dai had not yet received a detailed report on the CNAC accident in Qingdao). The Senators raised several questions.

According to Senator Yin Shuxian, he told reporters that the central issues of their current investigation are the responsibility for the accidents, airport facilities, ground personnel allocation, personnel management, weather reports, radio control, and aftermath measures. Today, they will summon the responsible persons of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation. Tomorrow, they plan to inspect the accident sites and console the families of the victims, as well as visit the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's office and the local prosecutor's office. It is estimated that the entire investigation will take four days, after which they will return to Beijing to report. Senators Zheng Kuiyi and Jiang Yong also stated that, in addition to investigating responsibility, they will seek the development and improvement of China's aviation industry and actively remedy various shortcomings in civil aviation.

[Additional News] Dai Anguo went to Longhua yesterday morning and afternoon to inspect the airport and aircraft equipment, and summoned the responsible persons of both companies to inquire about everything. It is reported that Dai will stay in Shanghai for several more days and return to Beijing to report after completing the inspection.

### Funeral Special Plane Arrives Safely in Qingdao

[Our Newspaper News] After the CNAC aircraft No. 121 crashed near Qingdao, part of the bodies of the passengers who died in the accident have been transported to Qingdao. The CNAC Shanghai branch dispatched a special plane from Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying family members and friends of the deceased passengers to Qingdao to identify the bodies and handle the aftermath. It is reported that the well-known actor Qiangshengli, a friend of Li Shifang, also took the plane to Qi to take care of the funeral arrangements. It is reported that shortly after the funeral plane took off from Shanghai, it was found that the engine was damaged.

### Housing Issues: Examination of Four Proposals

[Our Newspaper News] The Land Administration Committee reviewed four proposals related to land administration at its review meeting yesterday: (1) Request the Municipal Government to maintain the first resolution of the Municipal Council, explicitly ordering landlords throughout the city not to increase rents arbitrarily, in order to maintain the livelihood of ordinary people, and that landlords shall not refuse to deduct the housing donation portion, please make a public resolution and send it to the Municipal Government for effective implementation. The committee's opinion after review is that the rents in this city are still relatively low compared to other commodity prices. Although there is a difference in the rental of some houses compared to the original multiple regulations of the council, most landlords are still considerate of the burden of tenants and still charge according to the regulations. However, this matter is of great importance to the burden of tenants in the city, and the landlord's income is not enough to cover expenses, which is also a real situation. Because this case is of great importance, the council is not in a position to decide on its own, and requests the general meeting to discuss and decide on how to handle it.

### Extension of Unified Lease

(2) Propose extending the unified lease method to prevent military, government, and educational personnel coming to Shanghai from becoming homeless. The review opinion is: the original residents of military, government, and educational personnel and cultural groups who have been legally allocated and have no deficiencies are still allowed to continue renting. Those who have not yet signed a lease agreement, the original owner shall not refuse to rent for any reason, and shall promptly sign the agreement. The two methods are passed, and the request to forward a letter to the court for adoption and implementation is reserved.

### Requesting Allocation of Court Housing

(3) Request the Municipal Government to follow the resolution of the first general meeting of the council and allocate housing for the High Court and the District Court of this city on a deadline, so that they can relocate and work. The review opinion is to propose that the general meeting approve. (4) Request the Municipal Government authorities to stipulate the profit of the second landlord in intermediate leasing to reduce the burden on the third tenants. The review opinion is to send it to the Municipal Government for reference.

### Judge Housing Dispute: Involving Socialite

[Our Newspaper News] The famous socialite Lan Ni and the exporter Li Shenyan once rented a bungalow at No. 11 Haiyuan, Haig Road, from Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the lease expired in July of the 31st year. It was found that the owner of the house is Dai Rongwu, a prosecutor of the High Court, who entrusted Zhejiang Industrial Bank to manage the rent. Recently, Dai, who originally lived at No. 4 Rose Villa, Baisezhong Road, had the owner, the socialite Lan, needed to take it back for her own use, and wanted to move back to No. 11 Haiyuan, but the lessee was unwilling to give it up, so she sued in court. Yesterday, the District Court held a hearing, and the defendant's lawyer, Zheng Lintong, argued that the owner should have a reason to take it back for his own use. Zheng originally had a place to live, so why did he have to move? Lan, the owner of the Rose Villa, also originally had a No. 2 residence, so there was no reason to take it back. The plaintiff's lawyer, E Senzhi's representative, lawyer Wang, said that the Rose Villa is the property of Director Sun, who entrusted Lan Ni to manage it on his behalf, and now Director Sun needs to take it back for his own use. He also presented a letter from Director Sun to lawyer Zheng as evidence. The debate ended at 3:00 PM, and the date for judgment was set.

### Our Captured Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai from Australia: Various Groups Welcome and Console: The Jiangwan Road is Endless

[Our Newspaper News] More than 300 of our officers and soldiers who were captured by the enemy during the War of Resistance and forced to work as coolies in Australia returned to China and arrived in Shanghai the night before. After landing yesterday, they were temporarily housed in the barracks next to the Jiangwan Conservatory of Music. Military and police agencies and civilian groups in the city went to express their welcome and condolences, and ten rounds of military trucks transporting supplies and food were endless on Jiangwan Road.

The officers and soldiers who arrived in Shanghai this time totaled 339, including 36 officers and 303 soldiers. Most of them belonged to the 16th Division, 67th Division, and 79th Division of the former 86th Army in Zhejiang, totaling 245 people. A part belonged to the Southern Jiangsu Guerrilla Force, including the Righteous National Salvation Army Security Team, totaling 60 people. There were also 34 soldiers from the Four Lines Regiment. The team leader was Wu, a former lieutenant colonel staff member of the Lanjia Division camp. The deputy team leader was Ge Xianxiong, a former lieutenant platoon leader of the Special Service Battalion of the 86th Army Headquarters. In the spring of the 31st year, the 86th Army defended Quzhou to the death, and more than 2,000 people were captured due to being outnumbered. In addition to deaths and disappearances, there were still more than 503 people, together with 1,000 people brought from Nanjing and 1,600 civilians from Liangguang, totaling more than 3,000 people, all of whom were taken to Australia. After arriving on Yabul Island, New Britain, Australia, they were isolated and used for their disposal. However, due to enemy treatment, deaths accumulated, so when they first arrived in Australia, the total number of soldiers and civilians was more than 3,100, while only 1,567 people were gathered for reporting after the victory, and the death rate was more than one-half.

When Australia was taken over by the British army, with the help of the British, all 1,500 people were able to concentrate in one place after many days of searching and trekking through mountains and rivers. Until last month, the first batch of 1,139 people first returned to China by ship, of which 799 civilians from Liangguang had landed in Hong Kong and returned to their homes. There are currently 11 civilians and 417 officers and soldiers from Guangdong remaining in Australia, led by Major Chen Guo, waiting for the ship to return north.

The disposal methods for all returning officers and soldiers have been printed by the First Supply District Headquarters as "Investigation Forms for Officers and Soldiers Remaining in Australia", which are distributed to the returning officers and soldiers to fill out within three days, so that they can be reported to the Ministry of National Defense for hearing and assignment.

The French Concession Tram is Practicing "Slow Work": Passengers at Each Station Stand and Wait, Crowded Beyond Belief (Photo by Our Newspaper Reporter)

### French Concession Tram: Snail's Pace: Management Denies It is a Year-End Bonus Issue: The Company Loses Tens of Millions Every Day

[Our Newspaper News] Recently, due to labor disputes, the French Concession Tram has experienced a "slow work" phenomenon. On Xiafei Road, trams are connected end-to-end, moving at a snail's pace, and many passengers abandon the trams and walk. Reporters learned from the employees that this "slow work" is not due to disputes over year-end bonuses and wage increases, but due to dissatisfaction with the "Company Regulations" of the concessionaires. The company stipulates: (1) Must stop at every station, (2) Cannot stop if not at the station, (3) Cannot exceed the specified time, otherwise will be subject to suspension. Currently, three people, including No. 159, are still in the suspension period due to being punished for this reason. In order to make a strong resistance, the workers used the excuse of complying with the company regulations, implemented the rules of stopping at every station and not stopping if not at the station, and deliberately delayed the driving time, making it snail-paced. However, according to the management, the labor often does not comply with the company regulations, delays the payment time, and insults passengers, resulting in poor business conditions. After the recent "slow work" occurred, the company's losses have reached as high as 30 to 40 million yuan per day, so it is now applying to the Social Affairs Bureau for handling.

It is also learned that Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau believes that this action by the employees is a small matter for the company's losses, but it has a profound impact on the city's traffic order, so he is prepared to mediate in person. It is heard that Director Wu will convene the responsible persons of the tram workers' union today to listen to the labor's opinions and order them not to take "slow work" action from today onwards, so as not to affect traffic order.

### Jiangning District Office: Housing Disputes

[Our Newspaper News] The house at No. 12 Zhonghua New Village, Xinzha Road, was originally the property of the traitor Zhou Bangshi. After the victory, it was sealed up by the Third Front Army. Later, because the Jiangning District Office had no place to work, it moved into the premises on February 28 of last year with the permission of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and separately submitted documents to the Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters for record.

### Measures to Suppress Hoarding and Speculation: Social Affairs Bureau Ordered to Continue Application

The Social Affairs Bureau previously used the measures to suppress hoarding and speculation of important daily necessities during the emergency period. It is now asked whether to continue using it. It has been reported to the Municipal Government for requesting the Ministry of Economic Affairs to verify. It is learned that the Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to continue applying the measures, but it must be applied after designating the suppression area and goods according to Article 5 of the same measures and making a public announcement. The original application, except that rayon, velvet thread, soybean oil, and sugar are not included in the suppression, should be approved by law before being designated again. It has been legally designated Shanghai as a suppression area for the hoarding and speculation of clothing cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, fuel coal and charcoal, daily necessities paper, matches, vegetable oil, and pigments (including dyes), peanuts, and sesame oil. The implementation of the suppression of clothing cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth should be handled by the China Textile Professional Management Committee in coordination with the competent authorities. The implementation of the suppression of fuel coal and charcoal should be handled by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee in coordination with the competent authorities. Other items shall be executed by the competent authorities. The Central Trust Bureau has also entrusted to take care of the houses and found that after March and April, Zhang Yamin, an auxiliary police officer of the Garrison Headquarters, claimed to have occupied the premises as a residence through the relationship of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. After several negotiations with the district office, the lower level is still the office of the district office, and the upper level is used by Zhang Yamin as a residence. The phase has been going on for more than half a year, and disputes have arisen from time to time. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Zhang Yamin suddenly came downstairs and ordered the district office to move out immediately, and especially moved the documents, tables, chairs and other items out of the office and into the alley. After the district chief Hou Junren was informed, he immediately rushed to negotiate, and went to the Civil Affairs Office of the Municipal Government to report to Director Zhang Xiaosong, and asked to uphold justice. At 4:30 PM yesterday, he visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government. After Mayor Wu heard about the situation, he immediately expressed that he would definitely maintain it, and hand-wrote that the district would return to its original place and work as usual. It is heard that Mayor Wu has negotiated with the former destination.

### Fully Utilize Pudong Warehouses: Planning to Open a Car Ferry Line

[Our Newspaper News] According to the results of the Public Works Bureau's investigation, about two-thirds of the city's warehouses are located in Pudong.

### Hiding Gold in Bathtubs is All Fabrication: Personnel Friction in the Fisheries Management Office: Creates a Mystery on Fuxing Island: Prosecutor's Three Investigations Reveal the Inside Story: Hardened Cement Found to be Resources Intended for Illegal Sale

[Our Newspaper News] The intricate and complex mystery of the Fuxing Island gold hiding case has been clarified by the prosecutor Gu Hongbiao of the District Procuratorate after more than a month of arduous investigation. At 9:00 AM yesterday, prosecutor Gu, accompanied by clerk Yang Naichang and member Yu Lexing of the Headquarters, made a third trip to Fuxing Island, and returned to Shanghai at around 4:00 PM. On the island, they interviewed all relevant staff members of the Fisheries Management Office of the Agricultural Committee of the Headquarters, such as technical committee member Wang Qianli, administrative section chief Li Yunpeng, and Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, Wang Yikang, Xu Fuqi, and others. After returning to the District Procuratorate, prosecutor Gu hurriedly interrogated Chen Jiahuo and Tan Xinmin, who were in custody, and cross-examined them on what they had learned during the day. Although the two still refused to tell the truth, prosecutor Gu finally confirmed that the informant "Yang Biheng" did exist, and that his real surname was indeed Yang.

The cause of this case was due to personnel friction in the Fisheries Management Office, so it was mixed with some elements of intrigue and framing. So far, it is known that the matter of the two bathtubs of gold bars is all fabricated.

Although there are traces of resource leakage, it is difficult to find evidence, and the number cannot be estimated. Prosecutor Gu is now dividing this headless case into three parts: (1) Yang Biheng or "Yang Bitang" falsely accusing Fisheries Management Office staff of concealing gold bars and resources; (2) "Bai Zhicai" accusing Li Yunpeng of corruption and counter-revolution, etc.; (3) Resources left by the former Japanese army, which were concealed and sold jointly by Fisheries Management Office staff and Niu Chunlin, the then platoon leader of the island's naval garrison (who has been sentenced by the Navy Military Law Office). The above three parts are roughly clear. First, "Yang Biheng," whose real surname is Yang, "Biheng" or "Bitang" is either his courtesy name or an alias. Yang was instructed by two high-ranking officials to report the matter. Although prosecutor Gu does not yet know his exact address, it is highly likely that he will find this mysterious figure in the short term. The section of the confidential report signed "Bai Zhicai" accusing Li Yunpeng of corruption, etc., has been found to be a false accusation. The instigator was Zheng Ziping, the confidential report was drafted by Zheng Guodong and Wang Jindong, and copied by Zheng Weixin. All four have been taken into custody in the detention center. They are all acting under the instructions of others. Yesterday, prosecutor Gu specially interviewed a certain lady on Fuxing Island who participated in instructing the writing of the confidential report, but the lady had already fled and disappeared. As for colluding with the navy to steal and sell resources left by the Japanese army, this is a very obvious fact. After the naval platoon leader Niu Chunlin was arrested, someone secretly reported that Li Yunpeng had given 30 taels of gold to Niu Chunlin's family. Yesterday, the prosecutor asked Li about the matter, although Li only admitted to having visited Niu's family. However, the prosecutor believes that Li is the administrative section chief, and all the workers are hired by him, and most of the workers were introduced by the island's navy, so Li Yunpeng's relationship with Niu seems to be an undeniable fact. As for the extent of Li's suspicion, it cannot be determined so far. Li has now been guaranteed by Commissioner Yu of the Headquarters that he will not escape. In addition, the hardened cement buried underground discovered by prosecutor Gu on his second trip to Fuxing Island on December 3 last year has now been found to be resources left by the Japanese army, which a certain senior official attempted to conceal and sell illegally. Later, because it could not be transported out, it was buried underground in an attempt to cover up the evidence.

Yesterday, when prosecutor Gu conducted his third investigation, Xu Fuqi, the director of the Fisheries Management Office, Wang Yikang, the deputy director, Li Jing, the administrative director, Li Yunpeng, the section chief, and Wang Qianli, the technical committee member who was initially responsible for the takeover work, were all present. After more than five hours of questioning, it was clear that the prosecutor knew the subtle personnel relationships involved. Prosecutor Gu will take a car to Beijing this morning, or will be delayed in Beijing for several days, so there is very little possibility of new developments in this case this week.

### Fire on Jiangning Road: Three Factories Suffer Great Losses

### Mutually Accused of Being Traitors: Questioning an Old Private Tutor

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the High Court heard a case in which both plaintiffs and defendants were suspected of being traitors. Gu Rufang was accused of assisting the enemy and puppets by serving as a puppet Baozhang (neighborhood head) and a clerk at the Yikang Lane No. 7 soil warehouse in Caojiadu, and implementing poisonous substances. The accuser, Chen Jigeng, worked at the enemy Zhenru Radio Station. Because he stole light bulbs and wires, he was seen by Gu Rufang. Later, he was fired from the radio station and suspected that Gu had reported him, so he resented him and accused Gu at the High Procuratorate. Gu also counter-accused Chen Jigeng of being a traitor, so they were both prosecuted. Yesterday, the High Court heard the case and summoned the witness Qiu Tingzhen. Qiu is an old private tutor who gave testimony favorable to Gu, saying that Gu's appointment as puppet Baozhang was elected by the people.

In the Ni Qianji traitor case, the High Court held a hearing yesterday to summon witnesses. Ni was accused of cooperating with Xu Nianyi, the puppet Zhejiang Security Office Director, to open banks, silk weaving factories, and ham stores, and weaving military silk for the enemy to kill aircraft. Yesterday, witnesses Zhang Jizhong, Wu Mansong, Luo Haixun, and Shi Jinrong testified in court, which was favorable to the defendant, saying that the Huajin crepe woven was ordinary commodity and not military use. The court ordered a later hearing. Wu Jianchong, once served as the captain of the 8th Detachment of the Righteous National Salvation Army and an action member of the Military Statistics Bureau Shanghai District. In the 28th year, he was arrested by the Japanese garrison in Songjiang. After being released, he was ordered by the Righteous National Salvation Army to participate in the puppet organization and served as the puppet police chief. Later, he was captured by the enemy Hunan Gendarmerie and finally defected to the enemy, served as a secret agent of the enemy gendarmerie, and reported the whereabouts of Wu Jie, the secretary general of our two-way special party department, to the enemy gendarmerie, causing Wu to be arrested by the enemy. He was previously sentenced to eight years in prison by the High Court. The defendant appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial. Yesterday, during the trial, the defendant tried his best to defend himself, still claiming to be doing underground work and not defecting. Wu Jie's arrest by the enemy was not reported by him. The court ordered the sentence to be pronounced on the morning of the 14th.

On October 20th of the 33rd year of the Republic, Li Hu joined the escort team of the enemy's Central China Fisheries Company, serving as an adjutant and acting as a deputy squadron leader. He was previously sentenced to two years and six months by the High Court. The defendant appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial. Yesterday, during the trial, the defendant firmly denied the position he held. The court ordered the sentence to be pronounced on the morning of the 14th.

### Receipt Invoice Stamp Duty Measures Ministry of Finance Clarifies Doubts

When industrial and commercial businesses sell goods, they often issue invoices. When payment is received, a separate receipt is issued. Although both invoices and receipts are required to affix stamp duty according to tax law, it seems redundant to affix stamp duty to both when they pertain to the same business. It is understood that the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau has submitted three measures to the Ministry of Finance for approval, as follows: (1) If sufficient stamp duty has been affixed to the receipt for the same transaction, the invoice or bill of sale may be exempt from stamp duty, but it must be attached to the receipt for inspection purposes. If the receipt is lost, the invoice or bill of sale will be treated as tax evasion. Therefore, the issuer of the document must ensure that it is attached to avoid punishment. At the same time, to prevent customers from tearing them apart, the issuer should add a stamp on the invoice or bill of sale stating "Stamp Duty Affixed to Receipt No. X," and add a stamp on the receipt stating "This is Receipt for Invoice or Bill of Sale No. X." In this way, the documents can be easily verified no matter how they are stored, and there is no need to worry about being penalized. (2) If an invoice for the same transaction is issued and stamped first, the receipt issued later should still be attached to the invoice by the issuer and stamped. In this case, it will be exempt from stamp duty; otherwise, stamp duty must be affixed separately. (3) If the price listed on the invoice and receipt do not match, stamp duty should be affixed according to the higher amount. The above measures have been forwarded by the bureau to the Chamber of Commerce and relevant industries for their information.

### Book Industry Delegation Returns to Shanghai to Fight for Full Exemption from Business Tax

The delegation of representatives from the book industry in this city, who went to Beijing to petition the government, returned to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter visited the delegation representatives, who stated: The purpose of this trip was threefold: (1) to request the Ministry of Finance to grant a full exemption from business tax; (2) to request the Ministry of Communications to reduce postal rates; (3) to request loans from the Joint Treasury. On the day of arrival in Beijing, it was reported that state-approved textbooks could be fully exempted from tax, and other books would be taxed at half the rate. An inquiry was made to the Ministry of Finance for clarification. Li Tijun, the Director who received them, stated that the news circulating was unreliable, and the Ministry had not made a final decision on the tax exemption for the book industry, also stating that the book industry and the newspaper industry are both cultural undertakings. Therefore, the delegation earnestly requested the same treatment as the newspaper industry, with full exemption from business tax. Cui, the Deputy Director of the Direct Taxation Department, promised to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that, on the grounds of supporting culture, the newspaper industry has been granted a business tax exemption, and the book industry has reason to request the same treatment, otherwise it cannot be considered fair. Regarding reducing postal rates and improving delivery methods, Vice Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Communications and Deputy Director Huo of the Postal Administration, etc., solemnly stated that they would be happy to help with anything the Ministry of Communications could do. Regarding the loan issue, a request was made to the Joint Treasury. The focus of the problem was the collateral. Ordinary factories can use finished products, raw materials, or factory buildings as collateral, but banks have no precedent for using books as collateral. Therefore, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Vice Minister Li of the Ministry of Finance were asked for clarification. Both stated that books are also commodities and can be used as collateral for finished products, and expressed their willingness to help the loan succeed in order to save the book industry from its current crisis. It is heard that the delegation will soon send telegrams to colleagues across the country, urging them to work together to strive for this.

### Landlord Demands 2,000-Fold Increase in Rent for Dental College

[Reported by this newspaper] The District Court yesterday heard the case of Xie Zixian suing the Dental College founded by dentist Situ Bo, requesting a judgment ordering an increase in rent. The land on which the Dental College at the intersection of Lin Sen Middle Road and Ma Dang Road is located belongs to Xie Zixian and was originally rented to Xu Deji for a term of twenty-two years, expiring in 1952. In 1931, Xu Deji transferred the lease rights to Situ Bo, stipulating an annual rent of 560 yuan. Now Xie is demanding a 2,000-fold increase in payment. At yesterday's hearing, lawyer Zhao Zuwei appeared on behalf of Pan Gongzhan, the legal representative of the college, and submitted a statement of defense. He argued that the municipal government's regulations stipulated that the rent could only be increased by 144 times, and the college's current expenses already exceeded this amount. Moreover, upon expiration of the lease, all buildings on the land would belong to the owner, so his benefits were already substantial. The demand for a 2,000-fold increase has no basis, and he requested the court to reject it. The debate on the case concluded, and the court announced that a verdict would be delivered on the 14th.

### Bei Zuyi Returns from Hong Kong, Jokes with Reporters About the Weather

[Reported by this newspaper] In recent months, the situation of overseas remittances evading regulations and smuggling in Hong Kong seems to be getting more and more rampant. This has caused everyone to look south, hoping that the government will close this loophole sooner or later. Finally, four days before Christmas last year, Bei Zuyi, the Governor of the Central Bank, led Rogers, the British economic advisor of the Executive Yuan, and others, chartered a China National Aviation Corporation special plane and flew directly to Hong Kong. The day before Mr. Bei's departure, he also made a hurried trip to Nanjing. Therefore, everyone inevitably thought that Mr. Bei's trip was entrusted with a major economic mission. However, perhaps due to the influence of the weather, or other reasons, Shanghai newspapers published news of Mr. Bei's return to Shanghai as early as a week ago, but Mr. Bei never came. As a result of everyone's anticipation, Mr. Bei's special plane finally landed at the airport at 1:15 pm yesterday. Sensitive news colleagues, after 3 o'clock, went to the Central Bank to wait. President Bei was late in arriving, and after waiting for a long time, they had to leave one by one. After 5 o'clock, a second batch went to the Central Bank to wait. The hospitable ones handed their business cards to the tea servers to pass them in, and seeing that there was no sign of refusal, everyone sat down and waited with peace of mind. After a while, they were seen. Everyone scrambled for a piece of white paper, pen in hand, waiting for President Bei to announce the gains of this trip. President Bei said, "There is nothing to say..." Unable to withstand everyone's repeated questioning, he smiled and said, "There are two things that are worth saying. One is that the weather in Hong Kong is warmer than in Shanghai. Also, there are especially many Hong Kong mandarin oranges and apples. As for the rest... I'm sorry, I can only tell you after I go to Nanjing." Afterwards, everyone launched guerrilla-style questions, and President Bei said again, "Let the outside world speculate as they wish about the gains of this trip. I am working for the 400 million Chinese people, not for these speculators, so I am satisfied as long as I have a clear conscience." Disappointed, everyone had to leave with their still-empty journalistic appetites, dejectedly. (The above is a recent photo of Mr. Bei, taken by our newspaper reporter)

### Textile Control Commission Passes Detailed Rules for Yarn Purchase The priority for Yarn Factories is to sell Cotton Yarn; Cotton Cloth can be used as a Supplement when Cotton Yarn is Insufficient.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Textile Control Commission held a routine meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Attending were Wu, the concurrent chairman, Li, the vice-chairman, and committee members Shu Zhenzhang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qizi, Tang Xinghuo, Guo Dihuo, Lin Fengbao, as well as Liu Wenteng, the director of the Commission's Business Department, and Wang Zijian, the director of the Secretariat. Fang Dong, the director of the Goods Tax Bureau, also attended. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM. During the discussion, the new agreed-upon prices for various types of cotton yarn were determined based on the standard of 1,975,000 yuan per piece for the highest-priced 20-count cotton yarn, taking into account the production costs of each type of yarn. At the same time, the Detailed Rules for Cotton Yarn Purchase, consisting of eight articles, were passed as follows:

(1) These detailed rules are formulated in accordance with Articles 1 and 5 of the Measures for Stabilizing Yarn Prices.

(2) The purchase of yarn and cloth from each factory will be tentatively determined once a week. Starting from January 1, 1947, the implementation will begin in the 36 private factories in Shanghai and the state-owned China Textile Construction Company. Subsequently, the implementation will be gradually expanded depending on the purchase of foreign cotton by yarn factories in various regions.

(3) Each factory should fill out and submit a daily yarn factory report and submit a weekly cotton yarn and cloth sales notice, listing half of the yarn and cloth produced in the previous week that should be purchased by the government, directly to the Commission for processing.

(4) The Commission will review the items listed in the weekly cotton yarn and cloth sales notices from each factory and fill out a commissioned (approved) cotton yarn and cloth purchase notice. The approved copy will be sent to the selling yarn factory, and two commissioned copies will be sent to the affiliated China Textile Construction Company to handle payment, warehousing, and sales.

(5) Each factory will receive payment from the Textile Construction Company based on the Commission's approved cotton yarn and cloth purchase notice, along with the warehouse receipt bearing the Commission's title, tax bill, and receipt of payment. For the convenience of allocation and distribution, the aforementioned warehouse receipt should be issued for each piece. Afterwards, when the Textile Construction Company sells the yarn and cloth, it will endorse the original warehouse receipt and give it to the customer for collection from the factories.

(6) The products sold by each factory to the government should primarily be cotton yarn. For any high-count yarns, half of their production should be sold. If cotton yarn is insufficient, it can be supplemented with grey cloth. If grey cloth is still insufficient, it can be supplemented with dyed cloth. The labor costs for grey cloth and dyed cloth will be added separately. However, if the weaving workshops attached to each factory require more cotton yarn than half of their cotton yarn production, all excess quantities may be purchased back from the Commission by the respective factories at the current market price.

(7) The yarn and cloth sold by each factory to the government should maintain its original quality and continue to use its original trademark, being completely identical to the products sold by the factories themselves.

(8) These detailed rules will be implemented from January 1, 1947.

Regarding the purchase matters, the Commission has already sent a notice to all yarn factories on the 2nd of this month, instructing them to reserve half of their products for purchase. The Commission has also drafted inspection regulations for the standards and grades of various types of cotton yarn. Once passed at the next routine meeting, they will be implemented.

### Gold Prices Continue to Rise; US Dollar Also Up by More Than 400 Yuan

Gold continued to trend upward yesterday, driven by strong buying pressure. The opening price was 3.66 million, and the buying demand intensified, soon surpassing the 3.7 million mark. With no supply sources available, it continued to rise. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 270 taels at a price of 3.73 million, but buyers were not discouraged. Only after rising to 3.765 million did the Central Bank exert pressure, causing it to fall back to around 3.75 million. When buyers surged again, with no supply sources available, it again approached the 3.8 million mark at noon. In the afternoon trading, it briefly rose to 3.85 million, forcing the Central Bank to sell heavily, which caused a small pullback to around 3.78 million. As a result, it closed up 90,000 yuan from the previous close. Gold jewelry rose to 400,000 yuan. Silver dollars rose again, and the black market rate was stable. Interest rates remained at around 15%.

Foreign currencies also saw steady gains yesterday. The black market rate for US dollars opened at 6,400 to 6,500 in the morning. Later, with the gold market rising, it climbed to around 6,700 at noon. In the afternoon, with gold prices rising, the trend continued upward, but not by much. As a result, it closed up more than 400 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars also saw significant activity, driven by the exchange rate, rising from around 1,200 yuan to over 1,300 yuan. As a result, it also rose 130 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 1,180 yuan to 1,200 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,440 yuan to 1,460 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,000 yuan to 19,200 yuan.

Baiyuan rice was stable at high prices, while Yinyuan also softened. The oil market saw robust sales and purchases. Raw oil recovered after a period of weakness, first stabilizing and then rising, ultimately recovering over 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil remained strong. Suzhou oil saw brisk sales and purchases due to the aroma and dryness, continuing to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Clear oil was stable, and rapeseed oil was firm. The sales and purchase of Shantou soybean cake became more active than yesterday, rising slightly by 100 yuan. The situation for soybeans, in terms of both sales and purchases, did not appear robust and remained in a standstill. Red beans temporarily remained unchanged, while green beans from Nanyang were accumulated, keeping prices stable. Corn from Qingdao was scarce and in high demand. Red sorghum was being absorbed by distilleries, and the market trend was upward. Wheat was scarce and expensive, rising another 1,000 yuan, with demand still exceeding supply. Sesame was stable, but black sesame saw a surge of 10,000 yuan due to high sales volume in the market towards the end of the year.

### Food Evaluation Committee Readjusts Rice Prices with Respective Increases over Original Prices

The Food Management Section of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau convened a Food Evaluation Committee yesterday, which reset food rice prices as follows: (1) Changshu japonica rice at 69,000 yuan per dan (market transaction price, hereinafter referred to as "market price"), 76,000 yuan (door price); (2) Thin rice (market price) 65,000 yuan, (door price) 72,000 yuan; (3) Early rice (market price) 62,000 yuan, (door price) 68,000 yuan; (4) Pier indica rice (market price) 63,000 yuan, (door price) 70,000 yuan; (5) Milled indica rice (market price) 60,000 yuan, (door price) 66,000 yuan; (6) White indica rice (market price) 55,000 yuan, (door price) 61,000 yuan; (7) Mutton indica rice (market price) 65,000 yuan, (door price) 72,000 yuan. The above-mentioned evaluated new prices are slightly higher than the previously evaluated prices by 5 to 10 percent. After the meeting, Food Section Chief Shi Mingzhai stated: This rice price adjustment is not due to a lack of food or a cutoff in supply, but rather because the City Chamber of Commerce repeatedly requested that "the sales price of food should be reasonable and stable." After repeated consideration, it was decided to make a slight adjustment.

### Daily Necessities such as Cotton Yarn, Cloth, and Coal are Subject to Crackdown on Hoarding and Profiteering.

Ministry of Economic Affairs Responds to City Government Explanation

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau had previously planned to crack down on the hoarding and profiteering of daily necessities in order to suppress commodity prices. Because the Ministry of Economic Affairs' regulations on severely punishing hoarding and profiteering were very broad, all items except salt were not subject to the crackdown. This affected the implementation of the city's policy of stabilizing commodity prices. The City Government inquired with the Ministry of Economic Affairs for an explanation some days ago, and the response arrived yesterday. It stated that the item of salt, which was originally listed, had been designated in the past and should be addressed after consulting with the Ministry of Finance. As for the listed items of artificial silk, wool, sugar, and soybean oil, they were not originally on the list for a crackdown and should be designated after being approved by the Ministry. Shanghai is now designated as an area for cracking down on the hoarding and profiteering of essential daily necessities during the extraordinary period under Article 2 of the Measures, which includes: Clothing: cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth. Fuel: coal, firewood. Daily necessities: kerosene, vegetable oil, pigments (including dyes), peanuts, sesame oil. Furthermore, it is requested to announce this information to the public in accordance with Article 7 of the Measures. The enforcement of the crackdown on clothing items such as cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth should be carried out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Textile Industry Management Committee in conjunction with the competent authorities. The enforcement of the crackdown on fuel items such as coal and firewood should be carried out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee in conjunction with the competent authorities. The enforcement of the crackdown on other items will be carried out by the competent authorities.

### Although Sales to Customers are Sluggish, the Yarn Market Has Seen a Turnaround

The yarn market saw a turnaround yesterday. The stubborn trend of the previous two days was swept away. The rising prices of cloth and gold have led to firmness in the yarn market, arousing the buying appetite of people in the industry. 20-count yarn rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, while 32-count single yarn and 42-count sewing thread saw buying interest, rising by 60,000 to 80,000 yuan. However, sales to customers remained sluggish, which was a drawback.

### Cotton Industry Tycoon Chen Zixin Talks About the Plight of Cotton Farmers in the Suburbs of Shanghai. The Income from Farming is Less Than Half the Cost; Cotton is Unsaleable and Cotton Factories Declare Bankruptcy; the First Step to Saving the Situation is to Improve the Varieties.

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Chen Zixin, a cotton yarn industry tycoon from Pudong, to inquire about the truth of unsaleable mechanical-picked cotton flowers. He said: Jiangsu Province produces the most cotton in the country, and the counties near Shanghai, although the climate is relatively humid and the warm season is not long, are still excellent cotton-growing areas. 50 percent of farmland is used for cotton cultivation. Before the war, the annual output had reached 800,000 dan. However, due to the impact of the war, the original improved variety plan had to be suspended, leading to a gradual degradation of varieties. It is said that before the war, most of the mechanical-picked cotton flowers produced in Pudong were supplied to various yarn factories, while the rest were sold to Japan, India, and other places. After the war, with the opening of manual and power mechanisms, the cost of using mechanical-picked cotton flowers increased, and the products decreased significantly. Therefore, the path of mechanical-picked cotton flowers became narrow. However, according to what he knows, the cotton ginning factories purchased 20,000 dan of mechanical-picked cotton flowers last September. At that time, the purchase price was about 200,000 yuan per dan. Now, adding several months of interest, the cost has reached more than 300,000 yuan per dan. However, the current market price has fallen to about 170,000 yuan. As a result, some cotton ginning factories have declared bankruptcy. As for the cotton in the hands of cotton farmers, there are now also 300,000 dan. In terms of its production cost, if calculated on average in the eight counties near Shanghai, each mu produces 100 catties of seed cotton, which is one and a half gongs (i.e., one and a half bales), each gong of seed cotton weighing 67 catties on the market scale. When the new seed cotton came on the market at the end of September this year, the selling price per gong was 27,000 yuan, but now it has fallen to 27,000 yuan. The income of cotton farmers per mu is only 40,500 yuan. For those who cultivate on their own, calculating the cost of seeds, raw materials, labor, and paying taxes, each mu costs at least more than 100,000 yuan in legal tender. If they are tenant farmers, the cost will inevitably be heavier. According to the current price of cotton clothing, which is only 160,000 yuan per 100 catties (Sima scale), the hard-earned income of farmers at the end of the year, the value of each 100 catties of seed cotton, is less than half the cost. In other words, farmers must lose half the cost of each dan of seed cotton they harvest, even less than one-third of the cost. Therefore, the plight of farmers is very pitiful. The best temporary solution is to find a way to purchase cotton at cost. Otherwise, farmers will have no enthusiasm to plant again this spring. The fundamental solution is to start with improving the varieties. The main reason for the unsaleability of mechanical-picked cotton flowers is that they cannot be used to manufacture fine yarns. If the varieties can be improved so that they can be used to manufacture 20-count yarns, then the situation will improve. The relevant parties are now jointly formulating a method for improving varieties, based on the method of improving cotton seeds in the Yangsi District of Pudong before the war. They will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities to promote its implementation, in order to increase cotton production and solve farmers' livelihoods.

### Silk Industry Applies for Production Loans, Transferred to the Joint Treasury for Review

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Electrical Silk Industry Guild reports that rumors of the Production Loan Provisional Review Committee denying loan applications from the industry at its routine meeting this past Wednesday have caused widespread anxiety. Starting at 10:00 AM yesterday, an emergency meeting was held, appointing Cai Tao, Liu Qingyi, and others as representatives to inquire about the truth from Li Fusun, Xu Jiguang, Qin Runqing, and Lin Fengbao, standing directors of the Production Loan Committee. It was learned that the matter was a misunderstanding, and the Wednesday meeting had resolved to transfer the industry's loan applications to the Joint Treasury Loan Subcommittee for review. Yesterday at around 5:00 PM, the representatives took the case to the Municipal Government, intending to ask Mayor Wu to arrange a meeting with Huo Yamin, chairman of the Production Loan Committee, to explain the industry's current dire situation and the urgent need for loans before the end of the year. It is said that the Joint Treasury Loan Subcommittee's loan terms are stricter, mostly requiring raw materials and finished products as collateral. As such, the assessed loan amount for the industry is currently no more than 5.5 billion yuan. The Production Loan Committee's loans allow for half the collateral to be in the form of machinery, enabling factories to utilize the funds received. Factories stated that if they obtain loans from the committee, they will immediately repay the loans approved by the Joint Treasury to be issued by the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank.

### Two-Thirds of the Bottled and Canned Food Industry Closed

To date, only about 50 companies remain.

### Major Off-Floor Investors Absorb Shares, Hua Shares See Tightening Liquidity, Fatigue Gradually Emerges After 1000

Hua shares continued to rise yesterday, stimulated by the gold market and absorbed by powerful investors. However, they repeatedly advanced and retreated. Major investors off-floor absorbed substantial amounts, and the available spot supply became increasingly depleted. The market opened higher due to the lure of the gold market. Numbers 207, 47, 70, 155, and 186 came in to buy, with spot Yong yarn reaching 700 yuan, and forward Yong yarn reaching a high of 708 yuan. Numbers 14, 224, 76, and 83 sold, causing a retreat to 688 yuan. Numbers 198, 154, 180, and 197 came in to buy, and with the gold price rising, the market reached 716 yuan. Numbers 145 and 112 frequently supplied, and Number 173 also sold, causing the market to drop below 693 yuan. Number 97 bought from time to time, and Number 95 strongly bought spot Yong yarn. The gold market surged. After 11:30 AM, signs of fatigue suddenly emerged. Numbers 224, 145, and 78, among others, bought actively, and a certain powerful figure off-floor absorbed whole blocks of shares, leading to tight liquidity and a sudden rise to a high of 725 yuan for spot transactions and 732 yuan for forward transactions. After Numbers 89, 3, 198, 186, 171, 177, and 5, among others, disposed of their shares, a sharp decline was immediately seen. Forward transactions even broke the 710 yuan mark. However, the gold price closed exceptionally strong, and the noon close was still able to match the morning's level. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong yarn Hua shares rose by half a percent, while Xinhuo and Xinguang rose by slightly less than half a percent. Jingfu and Qinxing rose slightly, while Meiya fell slightly. Dormant shares such as Match, Commercial Press, Yonggong, Wuhe, and Jinglun each rose by a small amount, up to half a percent. The rest showed no improvement. In forward transactions, Yong yarn, Meiya, and Huafeng rose by half a percent, Xinhuo rose by slightly less than half a percent, and Qinxing rose by about 10%. In the afternoon, the market opened flat. At high prices, Numbers 112, 83, 174, 224, and 152 disposed of their shares. Although Number 198 made efforts to support the market from time to time, it still fluctuated downwards, with forward transactions retreating to 705 yuan. Numbers 155, 12, and 198 bought up to 717 yuan, while Numbers 186, 85, 154, 224, 147, 14, 180, and 70 sold actively. After 3:00 PM, the market gradually declined, falling below 700 yuan, and sentiment gradually weakened. Under Number 61's intentional suppression, supply was provided from time to time, and selling pressure suddenly increased. Spot transactions retreated to 676 yuan, and forward transactions to 677 yuan. However, the off-floor market appeared stable, and spot Yong yarn soon rose to around 685 yuan. At this point, however, forward transactions were still being suppressed by Number 61, but they were maintained by Numbers 198 and 152, and after their absorption, the market stabilized slightly near the close, rising slightly after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong yarn, Xinhuo, Jingfu, and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya and Xinguang each fell by half a percent, and Qinxing fell slightly. Dormant shares Match, Jinglun, and Yonggong rose by half a percent, Zhongsi, Lianan, and Wuhe rose slightly, Commercial Press was flat, and the rest fell slightly. In forward transactions, Yong yarn and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya rose by half a percent, Xinhuo fell slightly, Qinxing rose by slightly less than 20%, and Xinguang fell by slightly more than half a percent. Off-floor, all shares remained stable.

Foreign shares continued to rise yesterday. A certain account forcefully bought Yisha shares on behalf of the yarn industry and continued buying after the market closed, with transactions reaching 8700 yuan after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha shares rose by 15%, while British-American Tobacco, Yisha Beer, Wheelock Marden, Steel, Navigation, and Paper each rose by about half a percent. Ye Guang was flat.

### American Chamber of Commerce Advocates Revising Trade Policy Towards China, Reducing American Tariff Barriers, and Emphasizing Chinese Protectionism

[United Press, New York, 7th] Foye, President of the American Chamber of Commerce for the Far East, submitted a memorandum to the State Department's Exchange of Information Committee at the end of last month on behalf of 400 member companies regarding the trade agreement to be negotiated with China next spring. The memorandum advocated revising trade policies towards China and tariff values that hinder American exports to China, reducing American export tariffs, and reducing American tariff barriers on non-competitive Chinese goods. Although the companies had raised various tax reduction requests, the memorandum only addressed general trade policy. The Chamber urged the authorities to pay special attention to ensuring that the Chinese authorities adopt reasonable and consistent policies for the valuation of imported goods. The Chamber has received complaints from American exporters that Chinese authorities often estimate import duties based on black market prices in China, rather than on genuine wholesale market prices. This not only creates market chaos but also stimulates price increases. Another section of the memorandum pointed out the need to improve the procedures for the Chinese government to publish and implement trade regulations. Abruptly announcing new restrictions without early notification to importers, exporters, and relevant Chinese agents often creates unexpected difficulties for American businesses trading with China. Recognizing China's urgent need for various machinery, equipment, and foreign raw materials, the Chamber advocated reducing tariffs on a variety of American exports to China. This point is of particular significance in light of recent protectionist tariff proposals by the Chinese business community. Currently, there is a significant imbalance between China's imports and exports, with Chinese exports accounting for only a small portion of imports. Therefore, the Chamber recommends reducing tariffs on Chinese imports as much as possible. In fact, there are a limited number of goods imported from China to the United States that can have their tariffs reduced, so it is necessary to promote this policy. Before the war, goods from free trade countries, including important raw materials such as tung oil, raw silk, and raw hides, were mostly tax-free or taxed at a rate of two-thirds. However, the average tariff rate on taxable imports was over 55%. The Chamber believes that if these tariff rates can be effectively reduced, it will certainly stimulate Chinese imports and correct China's current import-export imbalance, which recently forced the city government to adopt an import licensing system. The memorandum further stated that the tariff rates should be reduced for various handicrafts and cottage industry products, such as carpets, lace, embroidery, hair nets, porcelain, bamboo ware, straw hats, etc. These goods do not compete with American products and had already established a firm position in the American market before the war. Due to inflation and economic collapse in China, which have caused high domestic living costs, the import taxes levied are often several times higher than before the war, greatly affecting sales. In order to promote sound reciprocal trade, these goods should not only be subject to tax reductions but should also be placed on the list of duty-free goods. The memorandum concluded that there is no way to improve China's export industry until the exchange rate is stabilized and the official value of the Chinese currency is consistent with its actual purchasing power. Therefore, the Chamber recommends that in addition to implementing tariff reductions, the Chinese government should also take measures to stabilize the currency system.

### University Basketball Game Yesterday, Datong Wins Over Tongji After a Hard Battle, Hujiang Defeats Datong in the Women's Group

[Our Newspaper] Three university basketball friendship matches were held yesterday afternoon, all at the Municipal Gymnasium. There were over 2,000 spectators. When the Hujiang women's team played Datong, the cheering squad came to the stadium to cheer, and the momentum was very enthusiastic. Unfortunately, the audience's level was too low, and they didn't know what a cheering squad was, and responded with "soda sounds", which was really disappointing. The results of each game are as follows:

Specialist Group Xin Zhuan Wins Over Gong Zhuan

In the opening game between China Xin Zhuan and Gong Zhuan, the referee was Li Zhenzhong. Both sides lacked coordination, and the battle was quite dull and lacked excitement. Gong Zhuan took the lead with 8 to 6 in the first quarter, but trailed behind with 13 to 19 in the first half. In the second half, Xin Zhuan's Zhao Jian made a breakthrough on both sides, rising straight up, and finally won a big victory over Gong Zhuan with 42 to 29.

Hujiang Women's Team Defeats Datong

In the second women's group game, Hujiang played Datong, and the referee was Zhang Juefei. The Hujiang women's team, led by President Ling Xianyang himself, entered the stadium amidst the cheers of the cheering squad. As soon as the whistle sounded, Hujiang's Ding Fuheng set a record and connected with the team. Captain Wang Shan was unwilling to fall behind and made six shots, and Datong had almost no power to parry. Moreover, Hujiang's guards Hua Huizhen and Li Aixuan played skillfully and lively. Datong's pitcher Wu Ronglin was surrounded by "walls" on both sides and had no way to do anything. Hujiang led the first game with 17 to 5. At the beginning of the second game, Captain Wang Shan played even more vigorously, with the courage of being unstoppable. She made four consecutive goals. Datong saw that the situation was not good and called a timeout to avoid the sharp wind. At that time, the guards were strengthened, which proved to be effective. Wu Ronglin made two more throws and one penalty, and only then did they get through the difficulties. Hujiang took the advantage with 25 to 10 in the first half. In the second half, the two sides fell into a melee, and few points were scored. By the last quarter, all the warriors were soaked in sweat and exhausted. As a result, Hujiang defeated Datong by a large margin with 32 to 14.

Tongji Takes the Lead in the Finale

In the finale, Tongji played Datong, and the referees were Zhang Juefei and Li Zhenzhong. The Datong team had two veteran players, Xu Zhongji and Lin Weicong, who were members of the Shantou team. They were in front and back, and their momentum was awe-inspiring. Tongji's lineup was more balanced. Although there were more "skinny" players, the charging power was extremely fierce. At the beginning of the competition, Tongji's Xiao Cheng made a penalty and broke the egg. Datong's Wang Zhiping returned the favor and made a penalty to even the score. After a long time of melee, Datong's Xu Zhongji started on both sides, and Datong took the lead by one goal with 7 to 5 in the first quarter. At the beginning of the second quarter, Tongji's offensive was fierce, and Xiao Cheng and Jiang Shangqing threw and cast you, and they made a lot of achievements. Datong only had Xu Zhongji active, and finally fell behind by one goal with 18 to 20 in the first half.

Calm Response Datong Wins

Changing sides to fight again, the two sides fought for each other, and tied twice at 22 and 28. In the end, Datong's Xu Zhongji and Lin Weicong, the veteran players, were extraordinary and responded calmly, and finally surpassed with 32 to 28. In the last quarter, Datong rose to catch up, and Yang Qiankun made a lot of achievements with long-range shooting and close attacks. However, Datong's veteran Xu Zhongji was like a tiger entering a flock of sheep, and he was unparalleled, and finally won the game. As a result, Tongji lost to Datong by 3 points with 40 to 43. The scores of both sides are recorded below:

Datong Fouls Tongji Fouls

Xu Qunlei 00 Xiao Cheng 24

Wang Zhiping 23 Jiang Shangjing 33

Yan Dianhuan 12 Yang Qiankun 22

Lin Weicong 38 Zheng Zemin 35

### Qinghai in Struggle

— Aerial Dispatch from Qinghai, January 2nd, Xu Tangying

Ten years ago, most Chinese people had a very vague concept of Qinghai. Even if they did, they would only say, "Qinghai, that's a desolate place." However, after nearly ten years of struggle, Qinghai has completely transformed itself today. It's like a four- or five-year-old girl who, after not being seen for a few years, emerges as a beautiful and talented young woman. So, people who have been to Qinghai before are invariably surprised by its progress when they visit it a second time.

Political Stability and Ethnic Unity are the Potential for Consolidating Border Defense

Qinghai was originally a virgin land, always filled with a tranquil and warm atmosphere. The snow on the Kunlun Mountains is still crystal clear, and the old peak of Gotasuchi still soars into the blue sky. The Yellow River and Yangtze River, which encircle the motherland, still flow eastward with surging momentum. What is different is that, thanks to political efforts, many bustling cities and large, close-knit organizations have suddenly emerged. Even in the newly established county bureaus today, such as Qisu, Chengdou, Angqian, and Xinghai, countless forces are being generated. These forces are guiding the pure Qinghai forward with courage, safeguarding the establishment of the southwest national defense of the Republic of China with their strong power. But in the past, who could guarantee that the current situation would exist? Because Qinghai has a long history of clan issues, which are complex and difficult to handle. The animosity between the Hui and Han during the Manchu Qing Dynasty is one example. Today, Qinghai includes clans such as Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, Kazakh, Sala, indigenous peoples, and Luòbā. In terms of lifestyle, some places already have cars, while others are still riding yaks. Some have built tall buildings, while others still live in yurts and Tibetan tents. There are differences in language and distinctions in belief. Some say that Xinjiang is an exhibition of ethnic groups, while Qinghai can be said to be a showroom of ethnic groups. But today, these many very different clans can live together in harmony, like family members, creating a miracle that is rare in all provinces of the country and even in the world. Even people who harbored clan prejudices and hatred during the Qing Dynasty can now forget their past grievances and reconcile as before. Today, the two million people of Qinghai can live peacefully, unaffected by any disturbances. This spirit of sincere unity is indeed the treasure of Qinghai. If this result were not derived from the political efforts of the past ten years, how could it be like this? Therefore, the security of Tibet today is closely related to this latent force in Qinghai and should not be underestimated. At the same time, because it is too harmonious, it is inevitable that it will be envied by others. In the middle of this, many people who specialize in nitpicking will naturally ignore the big picture and only seize on small points to spread rumors and cause trouble. Even so, the ethnic groups in Qinghai are like gold being refined, becoming brighter with each refinement. During the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once toured the Northwest. After Chairman Chiang arrived in Qinghai, he said, "Resistance relies on the Southeast, nation-building relies on the Northwest." Because the Northwest, in terms of location and resources, does have a worthy place for attention. Especially Qinghai, not only has endless grasslands for grazing millions of cattle and sheep, but also has abundant mineral mountains, excavating countless treasures. For example, Datong has coal mines that can produce tens of thousands of kilograms of coal daily and can continue to be mined for more than seventy years. The smokeless coal of Chashilang can serve as a strong backing for establishing factories, not only in large quantities but also with sufficient firepower. Recently, a large amount of oil has been discovered in Minhe. As long as there is machinery and talent, this "blood of the nation" is worth cherishing. In addition, endless fur, hides, horns, and bones are the treasures of Qinghai. At the foot of the Qilian Mountains, there are also many pottery clays and quartz, which are good materials for manufacturing furniture. All of these are what our country needs. But all of these require human harmony as a prerequisite. If the area does not have a stable force, then not only will there be no progress in political construction, but also the large and small problems between ethnic groups will cause suffering. Therefore, to observe Qinghai, we must think from the perspective of great achievements. If we abandon the overall situation and only look at one or two points of negligence, then we will fall into abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial. Therefore, the stability of the southwest national defense today is due to the cultivation of this latent force in politics.

Military and Political Cooperation, Educational Progress, Forging a Path to Survival in Difficulty

The late Mr. Willkie visited Qinghai. He believed that Qinghai's politics and military were quite successful, especially the integration of politics and military, so the performance was even better. This judgment is indeed far-sighted and does not allow others to doubt it. Because since the reorganization of the Qinghai Provincial Government in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, politics and military have been closely coordinated, so the construction of highways, the reclamation of wastelands, the cultivation of forests and seedlings, and the revitalization of water conservancy are all the results of military-civilian cooperation. The Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which was built last year, and the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway, which was built this year, are both more than a thousand kilometers long. Along the way, there is dense smoke and rain, no water or grass, and poisonous mosquitoes and bees that prevent people from opening their eyes. Once opened, maggots can grow in the eyes, causing eye injuries. Although the obstacles of weather and terrain are like this, the people of Qinghai have mobilized without hesitation, and in fact, the number has reached tens of thousands of people. However, the problem is not so simple, because along the way there are also Salar bandits harassing and looting in groups. Therefore, the local security forces went to protect them, and most of the national army stationed in the province were mobilized to help the people work. This has produced a lot of effects on the road construction work. Originally, the people of Qinghai have always suffered, and because of the War of Resistance, life has become even more unbearable. However, as long as it is for public welfare, as long as it is national affairs, they will forget their own suffering and carry out their duties diligently and strive to achieve them. This is the lovableness of the people of Qinghai, and it is also the national spirit that China needs most at this stage. Because of this advantage, the Qinghai garrison assists the people, and the people respect the soldiers, thus forming a close emotional relationship of love and cooperation. I remember that last year and this year, when repairing the Qinghai-Tibet and Qinghai-Xinjiang roads, the military and civilians went far into the wilderness, and food was often cut off. Seeing that everyone had nothing to eat, they were worried. Who knew that the troops came up with a way to hunt some wild horses and wild sheep, and after hunting them back, they first distributed them to the starving people. From this point alone, we can understand the feelings between the Qinghai garrison and the local people. The national army stationed in Qinghai not only maintains deep-rooted friendship with the people, but also produces for the country. In the Qaidam Basin and on the shore of Qinghai Lake, wheat waves are swaying in the wind and the crops are abundant in the fields, all cultivated by them. The desolate plains of the past have become fertile fields today. The barren saline-alkali lands of the past may have abundant fruits and vegetables covering the fields today. The Gansu-Qinghai Highway also has their blood and sweat. The trees planted in Qinghai over the years have reached 20 million, and even half of them are their handiwork. Before the War of Resistance, they used inferior weapons and vigorous morale to strike at the bandits who fled from western Sichuan and intended to complete the Luo Ming line. They also annihilated the crowd of Xu Xiangqian's Third Army with a force of more than 10,000 people. Later, they established immortal war achievements in Hexi, Longdong, Hainan, and northern Hubei. They have made great contributions to laying the foundation for the peace of the Northwest. When the situation in Xinjiang was tense in the thirty-fourth year of the Republic, a part of the national army that built the Gansu-Qinghai Highway was trained in Qinghai for a year. The army was reorganized, and the soldiers were strong. Then they passed through Yumen Pass again and laid the cornerstone for pacification outside the Xingxing Gorge. During the War of Resistance, in Anhui and the Central Plains Plain, the Qinghai cavalry was famous throughout the country and established many glorious miracles. Even the stubborn Japanese could not but regard them as a strong enemy. So, if someone goes to Qinghai, you will hear the people praising the army everywhere. Currently, the garrison area of the Qinghai National Army is Lejiawan and Litang. In addition to the local security teams, the total number is about one division. This was formed by reducing the army in May of this year. The remaining officers and soldiers who were dismissed have all been well arranged. Later, the Ministry of National Defense and the Northwest Headquarters sent personnel to inspect successively, and they had a true and good appreciation for military discipline and military affairs. Therefore, this national force has a considerable glorious history in the Northwest and can be said to be the most elite component in the country. If we talk about Qinghai's politics, it can be said to be very simple. And because the Qinghai authorities can pay attention to efficiency in politics, so every policy implemented is successful. All of literacy, afforestation, organization of Baojia, and prohibition of opium are completed on time. Among them, what is especially commendable is that in the eight years of the War of Resistance, Qinghai did not have a single traitor, did not have a single gang of traitors, and had only a small number of local bandits and rampant thieves. This result is entirely due to politics. What the whole country needs now is to seek progress in stability, and Qinghai was the first to apply this rule, and the success was very rapid. This is a fact that everyone can see. Therefore, the progress of Qinghai, in fact, is entirely due to the existence of a sound government. Most of the public education staff have qualifications from secondary schools, but they can all work hard and conscientiously. The government is even more concerned about the lives of public education staff in every possible way. In addition to paying their salaries on a monthly basis in accordance with regulations, the government also finds ways to distribute winter and summer clothing materials and fur coal every year. The lives of general public education staff can still be maintained to a minimum. The number of schools in Qinghai is quite considerable. There are now six secondary schools and more than 800 primary schools. Compared with before, not only the number has increased, but also the quality has improved. Twenty years ago, there were only one or two people who went to schools in other provinces. Now, statistics show that there are no less than a hundred people in various universities in the country. From this example alone, we can calculate the degree of progress in Qinghai education. However, the general cultural level still needs to be actively improved. Ling Chunsheng, the director of the Border Education Department of the Ministry of Education, made a speech in Lanzhou after inspecting Qinghai education last month, believing that Qinghai education is extremely developed. Even Xining City has more than 10,000 students, and especially women's education is even more reasonable. In short, Ling himself believes that "the impression of the inspection is extremely good."

Economic Foundation, Central Guidance, Make Qinghai's Glory Multiply

Talking about the economic development of Qinghai, it was originally later than political construction, but because a strong economic foundation must be built on a solid political foundation, so after Qinghai politics has temporarily tended to be stable, the government has actively paid attention to the development of industry, agriculture, forestry, reclamation, and mining have all been started one after another. In terms of water conservancy, projects specifically for irrigation are also being planned. The Huanghui Canal, which has recently been completed. The water canal and water project have also been planned and laid by an American expert, Moriel, and construction will begin next year. In order to complete the above-mentioned work, the government has specially established the Industrial Bank, the Industrial Company, and the Seagull Factory of light industry to specifically take on the responsibility of developing Qinghai's industry and to establish an ideal economic foundation. However, the industrial development of Qinghai has many difficulties in fact, so the performance in this regard is still very naive and fragile. This is a general phenomenon in the border provinces, and Qinghai is naturally no exception. However, Qinghai itself has many excellent conditions. Therefore, we believe that as long as the central government helps him and guides him, then in today's stable situation, Qinghai is the easiest to embark on the road to industrialization. Up to today, many party departments have been established in the Mongolian and Tibetan regions. There are also more than 10,000 Mongolian and Tibetan party members. Many princes and Living Buddhas have quickly become loyal party members of the Kuomintang. This kind of centripetal force that maintains the nation and the controlling force that stabilizes the border defense are worth paying attention to. However, in the past, in terms of elections, they were always not popular. However, in recent years, this shortcoming has been completely filled. For example, in the recent re-election of the executive and supervisory committees of the Qinghai Provincial Party Department, the people involved included representatives of the Mongolian, factory, farmer, worker, and women. Therefore, in terms of nature, it is relatively complete. We should naturally regard this as a kind of progress.

We already know that the inside story of Qinghai today is in constant improvement and progress. However, the fact that Qinghai still cannot be self-sufficient and urgently needs external help is obvious. If someone ignores this issue, then many objective conditions will limit its development. At the same time, many issues related to the overall situation, if they cannot be thoroughly observed and only imitate the CCP spokesperson Fan Changjiang's unfounded provocation and slander, then they will have failed the hard work and efforts of those working hard to defend the border!

### "Science and Culture Month"—A Pleasant Gathering in Paris

— Airmail dispatch from Paris, January 2nd. This dispatch was filed by our reporter, Paris-based Ren.

November and December of 1946 were proclaimed as "Science and Culture Month." The world-renowned city of Paris enjoyed nights filled with song and dance. The French authorities, as the host, seized the opportunity to showcase their organizational skills. From the perspective of China, the final few nights of the closing ceremony were particularly outstanding.

The personal art exhibition of Chang Yu-chun, a Sichuan native vigorously promoted by Ambassador Hsieh Shou-kang, was held at the Paris Women's Association (Ctlub Feminin de Paris), not far from the embassy. We specially set aside an evening to invite Chinese and foreign ladies, as well as prominent figures from society, to enjoy music and poetry readings. Chang Yu's works differ from other Chinese artists' who focus on Expressionism or Naturalism; he leans towards a new style of painting, Sur-impressionism. For example, a cat playing with a ball beside a flowerpot with a vermillion background, or white lilies in a glass vase with a black background, or a brown-skinned nude woman lying on a square mat resembling a primordial being molded from clay in ancient mythology. At first glance, they may seem rough and unrefined, but upon closer inspection, one must perceive the beauty of quiet observation within the colors.

Among those who signed the guest book were Zhao Songnan, the former Consul-General who married a young French woman at the age of seventy-seven, and former attaché Chen “Guang,” who gave up his official position to study singing. Also present were Ms. Huang Nutting, a socialite from Peking twenty years ago; Guo Youshou, the former Director of Education for Sichuan; Ms. Yuan Xingjie; Counselor Meng Juru; and Messrs. Yang Su, Wang Hui, Liu Hu, and Huang Qingcong. The event was presided over by the wife of Ambassador Qian Jieping, followed by Mr. and Mrs. Xiao Zisheng and Xiao Lingxiao, and Dr. Zhou Lin. After viewing the art exhibition, the guests gathered in the grand hall downstairs to listen to a piano solo by Ms. Li Xianmin. Ms. Li wore a dark green Chinese-style brocade jacket, draped over her shoulders without being buttoned. Its edges were adorned with golden sequins, which shimmered brightly. The openings and bottoms of the pockets were also encircled with sequins. Although her hair was cut short, it was parted in the middle and slightly swept back at the temples. Bejeweled earrings hung gracefully. The half-open brocade jacket revealed a honey-colored cheongsam underneath, with the lower part of the opening and the entire hem filled with golden sequins that reflected light, casting a beautiful shadow on the floor. The cuffs were also dazzlingly bright. Her fingers danced lightly and elegantly over the piano keys, displaying the skill and dexterity of the Chinese, a spectacle to behold. Looking down at her feet, she lightly pressed the pedals, alternating smoothly between them. Her fingers were used with agility in fast passages and composure in slow ones, like flower shadows in the wind or flowing waves under the moon, infinitely gentle and expressive. The piece she played, "Hommage a la Chine," contained a section that imitated the sound of the pipa. The sounds were like plucking pearls or playing with balls, clear and exquisite, evoking Bai Juyi's "Pipa Ballad" as a timeless masterpiece of realism. At times, she suddenly exerted great force, like a thousand troops and ten thousand horses, or like a magician performing amazing feats, washing away the sluggish and dull style often associated with the Chinese. Her agility was truly unmatched. The second half was low and harmonious, like slow-flowing water, sparse pulse beats, or the careful seasoning of a cauldron, with a relaxed and effortless touch, beautifully poetic. I record it as follows:

"The zither's melody shifts the clamorous hand, windblown blossoms rise and the moon flows. Shimmering light flies like scissors, nimble fingers quick as a shuttle. Exquisite artistry startles with its perceptiveness, complex harmonies respond with skill. For three days the echo wraps around the beam, in the western sea is there a Han E?"

Ms. Zhou Xiao skillfully blends Chinese songs with Western melodies, using great force to express them in one breath, with a vibrant tone that is entirely Western. However, when she sang Yunnan folk songs with Western notation, the Chinese flavor was particularly strong. Her voice was not overly passionate but rather gentle and refined, her demeanor graceful and elegant, like a willow tree in the wind. The audience, both Chinese and Western, was moved and praised her performance. Ms. Zhou, with her experienced demeanor, rested briefly after singing before returning to converse with the audience. Her long, floor-length black Western-style dress, covered with a Chinese-style brocade jacket with floral embroidery, immediately became the center of attention. The audience flocked forward to catch a glimpse, a display of social success rarely seen, showing a deep understanding of the Western psyche. I composed a five-character quatrain on the spot about her red brocade jacket:

"Beautiful quality surpasses the ordinary, preemptive voice seizes the myriad of fragrances, the wisdom pearl is happily grasped, the literary talent admires the Middle Kingdom."

Paris is the fashion capital of the world, where trends often originate. Now, two Chinese ladies' attire has conspicuously emerged at the French Women's Association, leading the way in this great fashion metropolis. Isn't this proof of the superior genius of the Chinese people?

### Coal Gas Poisoning

— Zheng Weiru

Recently, local newspapers have reported on cases of coal gas poisoning. Regardless of the accuracy of these reports, during the harsh winter season, such unfortunate incidents always occur due to heating with fire. When entire families gather together, the tragedy is even more severe. Therefore, I will briefly describe the causes and prevention methods below, so that everyone can take precautions and avoid such disasters.

When coal or charcoal is heated, it undergoes combustion. The carbon content combines with oxygen in the air, and all the carbon is converted into carbon dioxide, releasing heat. We use this energy to power machines, cook food, and in winter, we rely on it for heating. If we use a stove for heating without chimney and close all the windows tightly, there is a risk of poisoning.

Carbon Monoxide

When coal or other carbon-containing fuels are burned with sufficient air supply, the carbon in the fuel combines with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide, which is harmless unless it reaches extremely high concentrations. However, when the air supply is insufficient, the carbon oxidation only reaches the level of carbon monoxide. At this time, if carbon monoxide accumulates indoors, it is harmful to the human body. If the concentration of carbon monoxide in the air reaches 0.06%, a person in it will become unconscious in two hours. If the concentration reaches 0.1%, a person will lose consciousness in one hour. Moreover, the length of time we spend in air containing this gas is closely related to the severity of the poisoning. Even if the concentration in the air is not high, if we stay in it for too long, we can still be severely poisoned. In fact, what poisons us is not the coal itself, but the incompletely oxidized carbon monoxide. Therefore, it should be named carbon monoxide poisoning.

Pathogen

The red blood cells in our body have the task of carrying oxygen from the lungs to various tissues. After delivering the oxygen to the tissues, they return to the lungs to pick up oxygen and transport it to the tissues. Therefore, the only task of red blood cells is to transport oxygen. Without this transporter or without oxygen, we cannot survive. Carbon monoxide gas is not needed by our body, but red blood cells have a 250 times greater affinity for it than for oxygen! Therefore, once carbon monoxide is present in the room, red blood cells will bind to it with a greater intimacy that is 250 times higher than for oxygen. So once they encounter each other, they will bind closely and form a difficult-to-separate carboxyhemoglobin, abandoning the task of transporting oxygen. If one-third of our red blood cells have combined with carbon monoxide, we will not feel much. If it reaches 50%, the symptoms will be more obvious. If it reaches 80%, even if it is detected, it will be impossible to save.

The harm we suffer from inhaling carbon monoxide is not due to the toxicity of carbon monoxide itself, but entirely because the red blood cells bind to it so closely, completely neglecting the task of transporting oxygen. Therefore, if most of the red blood cells combine with it, various parts of the body will not be able to get enough oxygen, resulting in a state of oxygen deprivation. This is the cause of death from carbon monoxide poisoning.

Improvement

Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas, so even if it invades the room, we cannot predict it. It is lighter than air and not very soluble in water. Children are more susceptible to poisoning than adults, and birds are more susceptible than humans. Therefore, if a caged bird is kept in the room, the bird will die before the person. There are also other chemical methods to detect carbon monoxide, but they are not suitable for home use.

When we add coal to a burning fire, if the upper layer is well ventilated, we can see a beautiful blue flame rising, which is evidence of carbon monoxide being re-oxidized. In the lower layer of the stove, air enters through the grate, so the combustion of coal is complete, and the resulting carbon dioxide rises, encountering the carbon again and combining to form carbon monoxide. If the air in the upper layer of the stove is poor, the carbon monoxide will no longer burn. If there is a chimney, it will be sent out through the chimney. If the upper layer is well ventilated, the carbon monoxide will burn again, forming a blue flame. When starting a fire, the heat is not high enough to cause combustion, and the air circulation is not smooth, so it is easy to produce carbon monoxide. At this time, it is very likely that the harmful gas will fill the room.

The "Coal Gas Poisoning" Disease is not limited to small rooms.

If we are in a small room and close the doors and windows tightly, there is a great danger of poisoning if we light an oil lamp or burn charcoal for heating. The exhaust gas emitted after an internal combustion engine is started also contains carbon monoxide. If a 24-horsepower car is parked in a garage that can only hold one car in winter and the engine is started, the emitted gas can contain 7% carbon monoxide, which can poison the people in the garage in five minutes. In areas with tall buildings and narrow roads, the air in those areas can contain a high level of carbon monoxide due to traffic congestion and waiting vehicles. It is said that the Holland Tunnel under the Hudson River, in addition to the ventilation system, has an automatic signal that is released if the carbon monoxide in the air reaches a certain level as a warning. Household gas contains 6% to 16% carbon monoxide. If the gas pipe contains other odorous gases, we will notice abnormalities before being completely poisoned, unless we are asleep.

Symptoms - The earliest symptoms are fatigue in the limbs, heaviness in the head, dizziness, palpitations, nausea, and vomiting. Half of the blood has already been poisoned. In some cases, the onset is rapid, and the patient loses consciousness without realizing the problem, and dies weakly. The lips and nails of poisoned people are red.

Treatment and Prevention - If carbon monoxide poisoning is detected, the windows of the room containing the poisonous gas should be opened to allow indoor and outdoor air to circulate as much as possible. Or move the patient to a ventilated place and have them lie face down, and then perform artificial respiration, give them oxygen or a mixed gas of oxygen containing 7% carbon dioxide for inhalation, while keeping the patient warm. Before the poisoning becomes deep, they can still be saved. As for wearing a gas mask and risking going into a room containing carbon monoxide to rescue the patient, it is not necessary, because such climates cannot be attracted by ordinary gas masks containing charcoal!

If there is an electric stove or radiator in the room, there is no danger of carbon monoxide poisoning.

If a stove is used, a chimney for exhausting gas must be installed. If a charcoal basin is used for heating, it is best to start the fire outside first. After the coal is red-hot, place it inside. The same is true when adding coal. It is also necessary to open the windows to allow air to escape. Be sure to extinguish the charcoal fire before going to sleep to avoid poisoning while sleeping.

### Pathogens of Fever

— Wu Mao'e

Common sense that patients must know

Feverish diseases can be discussed in two aspects: One is entirely based on the cause of fever. (1) Physiological aspects of fever are mainly caused by the environment being too hot, or the body producing too much heat due to mechanical action, and not dissipating enough, such as heatstroke. (2) Chemical fever is caused by many chemical substances causing feverish reactions, such as sulfa drugs, caffeine, etc. (3) Fever caused by protein reactions: the addition of foreign substances can often cause feverish reactions, such as serum reactions. (4) Losing too much fluid can also cause high fever. (5) Increased metabolism in the body can also cause fever, such as leukemia and toxic goiter. (6) Infectious diseases: many infectious agents, such as filterable viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and rickettsiae, can cause feverish diseases. (7) High fever caused by nerve damage to the temperature-regulating center in the midbrain.

The above are the various causes of fever. Normal people do not have a fever. Having a fever means that a reaction is occurring in the body. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the reason for this reaction in order to treat the symptoms. Fever caused by physiological or mechanical reasons can be easily diagnosed once the patient's environment and activities are known. Fever caused by other chemical agents or drugs, excessive water loss, and high metabolism all have obvious backgrounds and are not difficult to diagnose.

The second aspect is how to explore feverish diseases clinically! Fever caused by various infectious diseases is what we encounter most often clinically. There are the most types, the most changes, and we need to pay attention to them. Once the pathogen is found and a diagnosis is made, medication can be prescribed accordingly. Otherwise, in this scientific era with many drugs, it will often be laborious and ineffective, even harmful.

The following special points should be noted:

(1) The patient's age, place of origin, address, occupation, and the date of onset, as well as the epidemic diseases at that time. Certain diseases are limited to childhood, such as measles, chickenpox, mumps, pertussis, chickenpox, poliomyelitis, etc. Some diseases are limited to local areas, such as kala-azar, Japanese schistosomiasis, etc. Some diseases are prevalent in summer, such as cholera, etc., as well as the epidemic diseases at that time, such as influenza and plague. These conditions must all be known to avoid trivializing or overemphasizing them.

(2) The initial situation of the disease. Various infectious diseases have various typical disease courses. Although not always accurate, there is a general pattern to how the disease starts and progresses. There are about three ways of onset: (1) Gradual or slow onset, generally indicating a slow development of the disease, such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and kala-azar. The pathogens of this type of disease need a long time to reproduce after entering the body, and there will be a feeling of discomfort during this incubation period before slowly developing into the typical course of the disease. (2) Sudden onset, generally indicating that bacteria or a certain toxin suddenly enters the body, such as diseases caused by various septicemias or allergic toxins. (3) Acute infectious type, with very obvious signs, such as high fever, headache, and vomiting, indicating the start of an acute infectious process. Most common acute infectious diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis usually have this type of onset.

(3) Early important symptoms and signs: Early blood poisoning, exhaustion, headache, and systemic pain are particularly significant in the following diseases: typhus, relapsing fever, malignant malaria, epidemic diseases. If there is sudden bleeding, it can be seen in typhus, relapsing fever, and spotted fever. Severe headache and vomiting should suggest meningitis. If a rash is common in measles, meningitis, and pneumonia.

(4) Rashes: Feverish diseases with rashes can be classified separately. Attention should be paid to the date of onset of the rash, its characteristics, distribution, and evolution. Chickenpox, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles, typhus, and typhoid fever can all cause rashes, and the date of onset of the rash is generally as in the sequence listed above. The rash of chickenpox can be seen on the first day, and the rash of measles generally appears on the fourth day. Other diseases such as meningitis, relapsing fever, and dengue fever can also cause rashes. Furthermore, the rashes of these infectious diseases all have their specific current conditions and developments.

(5) Characteristics of body temperature: There are various levels of fever. Low fever, the temperature is between 99 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Moderate fever, the temperature is between 100 and 103 degrees Fahrenheit. High fever, the temperature is above 105 degrees Fahrenheit. There are different types of fever, and typical infectious diseases all have their regular patterns. Can be divided into three categories (1) Sustained fever, with daily changes that are minimal and imperceptible, not exceeding two degrees. Typhus, pneumonia, and scarlet fever all belong to this category. (2) Remittent fever, where the daily changes exceed two degrees, but the lowest temperature is still above normal. Typhoid fever is an example. (3) Intermittent fever, where the feverish period is the same as or sometimes below normal, and each period can last for several hours or days, interconnected. This type is seen in intermittent fever of malaria, relapsing fever, and undulant fever.

The course of body temperature: Each typical disease has its special heat cycle.

Short-term fever, subsiding within ten days. These diseases are self-limiting, such as dengue fever.

Long-term fever, the process is also prolonged, and it is most worthy of attention, as it easily weakens the patient's physical strength and leads to a poor constitution. There are at least three diseases that should be considered first: typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and septicemia. Other long-term fever diseases include: (1) Local diseases such as kala-azar, Japanese schistosomiasis, malaria, and undulant fever. (2) Hidden lesion infections such as appendicitis, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease in women, or subacute endocarditis. (3) Syphilis and other chronic diseases.

In short, to diagnose the source of a feverish disease, you must first carefully observe the natural process of the disease's fever and other special symptoms, and then add other collateral evidence before proceeding!

### Physiology and Pathology of Fever

— Chen Yueshu

Temperature Regulation - We all know that humans are warm-blooded animals, capable of maintaining a body temperature of around 37 degrees Celsius in normal environments. This stable body temperature results from the delicate balance of two opposing actions. Daily food intake, stomach digestion, heartbeats, muscle exertion, and the metabolic combustion of various nutrients within the body all generate heat, raising body temperature. Conversely, blood continuously flows through subcutaneous capillaries, radiating and conducting body heat outwards. The lungs constantly inhale cool air and exhale warm air to dissipate body heat. If body heat is still excessive, sweat glands in the skin secrete sweat, which evaporates and absorbs a large amount of heat. These two processes—heat generation and heat dissipation—are balanced in a normal human body under the control of the nerve center in the hypothalamus of the diencephalon.

Mechanism of Fever - If this temperature-regulating mechanism is overwhelmed by excessively high external temperatures (such as heatstroke) or disrupted by other causes (such as bacterial infection), the patient develops a fever. During a fever, the patient experiences chills and shivering, with muscles contracting to increase body heat. Subcutaneous blood vessels constrict, and sweat disappears, minimizing heat dissipation. Therefore, when the patient feels cold and shivers, body temperature rises sharply. Both the increased heat generation and the reduced heat dissipation are part of the fever mechanism, but the latter is more important than the former. In normal individuals, heat production can increase by 200-300% during intense exercise without causing a fever. In contrast, heat production in a febrile patient increases by only 20-30%. After the temperature rises, it remains at an abnormally high level due to the action of the nerve center. This mechanism is similar to raising the temperature level inside a thermostat by turning a dial. When the patient's fever subsides, subcutaneous blood vessels dilate, and profuse sweating occurs, releasing a large amount of body heat. The nerve center also restores its function to maintain a normal temperature level.

Causes of Fever - There are many causes of fever. The most common is bacterial infection (such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, pneumonia, etc.), which is well known and does not require further elaboration. Let me briefly mention several less well-known causes of fever: (1) Brain damage - As mentioned earlier, body temperature is controlled by the nerve center, so damage to the brain, especially to the diencephalon and pons, can affect this nerve center and cause high fever. (2) If the mechanism for maintaining body temperature balance is overwhelmed by excessively high external temperatures, a person will develop a fever. This type of fever is seen in heatstroke and when using artificial hyperthermia devices. (3) Heterologous proteins (such as intravenous injections of milk or typhoid vaccine) entering the human body can cause high fever. Fever caused by malaria and post-transfusion reactions are also of this type. (4) Certain malignant tumors can often cause patients to develop a fever. The most common examples are adrenal gland tumors and Hodgkin's disease. (5) Certain drugs can also cause people to develop a fever. In summary, the causes of fever are numerous and complex. However, after careful consideration and research by scientists, it seems that there is a common pathway to be found, namely, that fever is often the human body's reaction to the invasion of heterologous proteins (these heterologous proteins may come from bacteria, protozoa, or altered products of malignant tumors, etc.).

Significance of Fever - What is the significance of fever? To date, a definite and satisfactory answer has not been found. In the eyes of ordinary people, fever is harmful and useless, which is very obvious and beyond doubt. Medical experts also acknowledge that excessively high fever (such as above 105 degrees Fahrenheit) is extremely harmful to patients and can lead to death. However, at lower levels of fever, the human body's resistance to bacteria seems to be more favorable than without fever. Two researchers, Lolle and Maijia, conducted animal experiments. They divided animals into two groups, one group was made to develop a fever through artificial heating, and the other group was not made to develop a fever. At the same time, small amounts of bacteria were successively injected into the bodies of the two groups of animals. The two researchers discovered that the animals that developed a fever survived for a longer period of time than those that did not develop a fever and were able to resist larger injections of bacteria. Generally, the mechanism by which the human body resists bacterial invasion can be divided into two parts: one is the phagocytosis of bacteria by white blood cells, and the other is the production of antibacterial immune bodies (such as antitoxins, agglutinins, bacteriolysins, etc.). Lolle and Maijia's further research found that in febrile animals, the production of agglutinins and bacteriolysins was both greater and faster than in those without fever. Therefore, from the above experimental results, we can speculate that fever seems to be a protective function of the human body against bacterial invasion, and not absolutely harmful and useless.

### New Medical Knowledge

— Qiao Shumin from New York

Surpassing DDT

The wonderful insecticidal properties of "DDT" are almost universally known. However, scientists are not satisfied with this. They replaced two "chlorine" atoms in the "DDT" molecule with two "fluorine" atoms, creating "DFDTDileuoro lipnenyl—trichloro— thane". According to a recent report by Professor H. L. Bradlow of the University of Kansas, "DFDTD" has stronger insecticidal properties than "DDT" and its effective period is longer, but its toxicity to warm-blooded animals is lower than that of "DDT". However, it shows no mercy to cold-blooded animals. Cold-blooded animals, your doomsday is coming soon!

Old Method, New Use

Using the "Methylene blue test" to detect the presence of bilirubin in urine is originally a simple and easy old method. However, only recently did someone think of using it to examine whether the livers of patients with amebic dysentery have been affected. There are many diseases like amebic liver abscess in China. It seems that there must be applications in clinical diagnosis.

Application of Atomic Physics in Medicine

Since the atomic bomb sounded like a thunderclap in Hiroshima, it was truly "earth-shattering" and "shocking to the world". In this atmosphere of peace, dimness, and dense clouds of doubt, some people inevitably curse the physicists who discovered atomic nuclear fission. In fact, the inventions of science, for good or for bad, are up to people. Scientists themselves should not be held responsible for their sinful behaviors. For example, the phenomenon of atomic nuclear fission can be used to kill people, but it can also be used to save people. Taking the current immature stage, there are at least two uses for medicine:

Almost all substances can be transformed into radioactive substances by bombarding the "neutrons" in the atomic nucleus with an atomic fission device. For example, ordinary phosphorus is not radioactive, but after a series of atomic nucleus bombardments, it can be transformed into radioactive phosphorus. If it is eaten by humans, then its whereabouts can be accurately measured, which will make a great contribution to the study of metabolism in physiology, and it can certainly be useful in the diagnosis of certain diseases.

Also, many diseases require radiotherapy. However, there are so few naturally radioactive substances that things are valued according to scarcity. Poor patients are cheap, and they are all irradiated from outside the body. The effect is weak, and there are many drawbacks. But the contribution of atomic physics is great. It can turn the substances we need into radioactive substances, which can be taken orally or by injection, so that the substance directly approaches the diseased area, which is convenient, effective, affordable, and safe - it can be said to have all four virtues.

### Latest Contributions of Pharmaceutical Chemistry - Artificial Penicillin

— Shu

Penicillin is one of the two major discoveries of this war, which is already well known. However, the real manufacturing work, before November of this year, was still being secretly carried out by "Ms. Penicillium" herself in her tiny cell factory, which no one could see. However, British and American scientists were not reconciled. With the organization and funding of the government, a total of thirty-seven research teams were established - twenty-six teams in the United States and eleven teams in the United Kingdom - to explore separately, to open the secrets of nature, and to compete with "Ms. Penicillium" for superiority.

"Where there is a will, there is a way"! Sure enough, on November 7th, the team led by Professor Vincent du Viganeaud of Cornell University in New York announced the successful artificial synthesis of penicillin! After countless failures, and bumping into who knows how many walls, they did not despair, did not lose heart, and did not blame heaven or others. Now they proudly look at the brown crystal, shining brightly, and they also show a victorious smile.

We know that there are at least four different types of penicillin today - type F, type G, type K, and type X. Types F and K penicillin are produced in small quantities and have little application; type K penicillin is rapidly destroyed in the human body (four times faster than type G), and the therapeutic effect is limited; the type circulating on the market is mostly type G penicillin.

The structure of type G penicillin is quite complex. The method carried out by Viganeaud is also similar to the ordinary artificial synthesis method. First, he tries to decompose it into simpler units, tries to imitate them, and then tries to synthesize these simpler units into a complex whole. Professor Viganeaud divided type G penicillin into two slightly simpler units, dextro—penicillamine hycrochlorice and 2—benzyl—4—inethoxymethyleoe—(4)—oxazolone, and then, after countless twists and turns, and unremitting efforts, he finally succeeded step by step.

The manufactured substance certainly has antibacterial properties, but there are many substances with antibacterial properties, which does not prove that it is she - type G penicillin.

"Not afraid of not knowing the goods, but afraid of comparing goods." Scientists know this truth well, so they used the principle of radioactivity to compare goods. It is so spectacular that there is no time to describe it in detail. Let me talk about their principle, which is to take radioactive sulfur (Raoloactiyegulphur) to combine into the molecules of this new drug, and then mix them with the G-type penicillin secreted by "Ms. Penicillium" in nature, recrystallize and recombine them into a compound. At this time, the radioactive sulfur contained in its molecules can be monitored with a "Geiger counter". If they run away on their own, then they are different from natural penicillin. However, they always followed faithfully during all the monitoring process. Thus, science confirmed that "two are one".

Secondly, how to refine this synthetic penicillin into a pure crystal? The method they used was to use two immiscible solvents, one of which has a greater solubility for penicillin, so penicillin gradually concentrates into this solvent. If this is repeated several times, finally, a small pinch of pure brown crystals - the first human-made penicillin - appears in the hands of scientists.

From an economic point of view, can this artificial synthesis compete with nature? Not yet. However, all artificial synthesis methods, after commercial application, are always the most economical production methods, so in the near future, there may be cheap penicillin to save all living beings!

However, the reporter believes that what is especially important is that after the successful artificial synthesis of penicillin, it is possible to discover some useful derivatives in chemistry, just as Prontosil has several sulfonamide derivatives, which is also unknown. Professor Viganeaud smiled, the reporter smiled, and the readers will also laugh.

Anecdotes and Common Sense

### Mark Twain and "The Jumping Frog"

— Dailing

If you have seen the film "The Humor Master", you will definitely feel infinitely interested in the scene of the "Jumping Frog Competition". Now I want to talk to you more about the story of the jumping frog.

Although Mark Twain only wrote the wonderfully interesting story of "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" in 1863, Americans did not truly value it until May 1928. From that time on, photos of big frogs were often published on the front page of Washington newspapers. The death of a famous frog even caused tens of thousands of people to mourn.

In May 1928, the people of Calaveras County organized the first "International Jumping Frog Competition", which is held annually. However, because Mark Twain did not describe the jumping frog rules in detail in his story, they had to formulate some rules themselves, which were surprisingly successful and have been used to this day. According to these rules, the frog must jump three consecutive times, and the farthest one is the champion. The total jumping time for each frog is ten seconds. Several circles are drawn on the ground, each circle being three to five feet apart, and the starting point is the center of the circle. (The reason for drawing circles is to make it easier for bystanders to calculate the distance of the frog jump.)

The frog owner can use a stick or other methods to stimulate the frog to move forward during the first jump, but during the second and third jumps, they must not do anything and must completely rely on the frog's own happiness to determine the outcome.

The Cleverness of the Frog Owner - In the eighteen years since the "Jumping Frog Competition" was held, frog owners have invented many mechanical objects. One person made an electric baton that would cause a vibration when touched to the frog's body. But this was of no use. After the frog shook for a while, it was unhappy and stopped jumping.

Some people tried using injections and pills, and although the purpose was to stimulate, it often made the frog extremely comfortable and fell asleep in the circle halfway.

Another person was very secretive beforehand. When it was his turn to jump, he insisted on keeping his frog in the box because it was trained to jump directly out of the box. He put the box in the circle, opened the lid, and his frog jumped out like a fly, jumping forty feet - almost breaking the record of three world champions combined. Everyone was very suspicious of this "super frog". Upon investigation, it was found that the bottom of the box was attached with a strong spring. As a result, the person was disqualified from the competition, and he made a fool of himself.

Does the Frog Need Training? - Many people eagerly discussed the issue of whether jumping frogs need training. Some winners said that without their care and training, they would definitely not have such good results. But some other people will tell you that they caught the frog from the bottom of the river and immediately rushed to participate in the competition. Although there was no training at all, they easily won the championship.

Regardless of whether training is effective or not, since jumping frogs became an organized sport, the jumping distance has indeed increased day by day. In the early competitions, the winning frogs only jumped three or four feet, but now it is necessary to jump ten to sixteen feet.

Last year, a frog called "Maki" jumped sixteen feet and two inches, setting a new world record. In 1937, someone fed a live bee to his frog, causing it to jump twenty-one feet and four inches. But he still did not win because the frog jumped backwards.

The day before a certain annual competition, a bamboo basket was received with a tag attached: "Handle with care: urgent. Jumping frogs en route to the 'Jumping Frog Competition'." The basket was full of Spanish soil, with two North Carolina frogs inside. They were transported by rail from the Washington Fire Department to participate in the competition.

Those Who Underestimate the Enemy Fail - Bing Crosby specially airlifted a frog to compete, but the frog was probably too arrogant and did not move an inch in ten seconds.

A Parisian carried his pair of French frogs, each weighing one and a half pounds, across the Atlantic Ocean, through the Panama Canal, and then up the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. When one of them "left the pet", it jumped into San Francisco Bay. The heartbroken owner described its jumping posture as "great". The other frog, having lost its companion, had no intention of training and ended up in complete defeat and returned in disgrace.

For eighteen years, Calaveras has become the center of the world's frogs. Thanks to Mark Twain's pen, he made it possible for this interesting "sport" to continue permanently, and also made it possible for some childlike innocence to remain in this noisy world.

### Playing Secretly?

— Wei Ling translated from "Esperanto Gems"

Judge: How could you leave a pre-written note when you steal, stating that theft is your profession!

Thief: Then what did you think? Am I playing secretly?

"Why are you begging?"

"Because I want to eat, my good sir!"

"Then why don't you work?"

"Ha, if I work, I still need to eat even more!"

### One Hurdle After Another

— Fang Wen

It hasn't been long since the Gregorian New Year, and the Lunar New Year is coming soon.

Celebrating the new year twice in one year, this repetitive drama is everywhere in China, where new and old ideas are confused and conflicting. Is it just celebrating the new year?

Celebrating the new year twice in one year always feels a bit repetitive and troublesome in terms of emotions. It may not be impossible for rich people to celebrate the new year once more, to have a more lively scene, but for poor people it is not so simple. Celebrating the new year once more means passing one more difficult hurdle.

In one's life, I don't know how many difficult hurdles one has to go through. Since rushing out of the mother's womb and entering the world, it is followed by the school entrance hurdle, the exam hurdle, the graduation hurdle, the job application hurdle, and then running into walls everywhere in society, the layoff hurdle, and the unemployment hurdle come one after another, plus the love hurdle, the marriage hurdle, and the disease hurdle. Women also have an additional childbirth hurdle. Almost until old age and death, they still have to pass a ghostly hurdle. Now, out of thin air, two more New Year hurdles are added each year. The human body is made of flesh and blood, how can it withstand so many difficult hurdles?

Therefore, whenever I recite the sentence: "There is no calendar in the mountains, and one does not know the year when the cold is over," I am always fascinated by it.

### A Few Words from a Worldly Old Man

— Shu Xiang

A worldly old man is a modern old man; the old man wears glasses on his nose, has a long beard on his cheeks, has a thin face, and is energetic. He looks similar to Santa Claus. He is over seventy years old, but he still walks briskly, walking through the streets and alleys every day, silently observing the current social situation, and likes to read newspapers. He subscribes to newspapers both domestically and internationally. With his unique and insightful ideas, he analyzes and argues, gains something every day, and carefully records it at night. Over the years, he has written thousands of books of talk, which are both humorous and witty. Excerpts of them are presented to the readers.

The old man read the newspaper and saw that the Kuomintang and Communist armies were fighting for the city of Lianshui. When the Communist army retreated and the Kuomintang army entered the city, there were only three old women left in the city. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration provided relief flour, but no one accepted it; the old man first sighed, and then happily said: "What is difficult for people is the liberation of death. Now that the results of liberation are like this, it is really a great good thing to relieve the suffering of the masses from freezing and starvation"!

The old man has several friends who work in educational institutions with very low salaries. His friends came to his residence to complain! The old man calmly said to them: "Salaries are originally only for purchasing salaries. Now that it lives up to its name, who says it is not appropriate."

A wife of a veteran of the War of Resistance complained to the old man that her husband was unfaithful. The old man said with emotion: "The War of Resistance was temporary, and now it is over. Madam can rest." The madam suddenly realized, was disappointed and left.

The old man read the Analects to the sentence "Ancient scholars studied for themselves, and modern scholars study for others" and said: "Which of today's scholars does not study for themselves, who says today's people are not as good as the ancients."

The old man walked on the street and met a county magistrate passing by. The entourage was noisy and pedestrians were prohibited from passing. The old man strode forward with his head held high and was arrested by ××. The old man scolded loudly and said: "The county magistrate is also a human being, and I am also a human being. Why should I fear him"! Before he finished writing, ×× arrested him and put him in prison. The old man began to regret greatly and said: "I regret not being a county magistrate, which led to this disaster"!

One day, a ×× rode a horse across the road and injured a rural woman. The woman cried in pain. The old man passed by and said to her: "This is a road for horses. You walked on the road and were injured by a horse. What is the fault of the horse"?

The old man saw that robbery cases were rampant, so he laughed and said to people: "This is because there are two classes of rich and poor in society. If everyone were poor thieves, then there would be no thieves."

On New Year's Day, the old man was walking in the street. He saw the national flag flying, the city was silent, and passers-by seemed not to know that it was New Year's Day. The old man said when he saw this situation: "The Gregorian calendar is easy to pass, but the Lunar calendar is hard to endure."

The old man saw newspaper advertisements with many marriage and divorce announcements. The content often said "We two are in love with each other and are willing to spend our lives together", "We two have disagreements and it is difficult to spend our lives together", and he often shook his head and sighed: "If I had known today, why did I do it in the first place"!

Public and educational personnel are paid meagerly and work hard to serve the public, never tired. Other workers' compensation is higher than everything else. If there is any disagreement, they will respond with a strike. As a result, it finally comes to their wishes. Someone asked the old man for a method to eliminate labor disputes. The old man dismissed the people around him and whispered: "Let the workers read a few more years of books, like public and educational personnel, and there will be no future troubles."

In a certain province, boys and girls attend the same school, and the old school faction disapproves of this. Therefore, an anonymous poster was made and posted on the gate of a certain school saying: "Wonderful, wonderful, this university is really effective. Before three years are up, it will turn into a Temple of the Child-Giving Goddess." The old man also echoed it in the original rhyme, and the last two sentences said: "Wonderful, you say that boys and girls cannot attend the same school, why are Arhats sculpted in the Guanyin Temple"?

One day, the old man was walking on the street with a Western friend. It was raining and the road was muddy. There was so much mud on the street that it looked like a rice field. The Western friend asked why the road administration did not repair it like this? The old man replied: "This year, the drought is severe and there is little rice. In the future, we will grow wheat and rice on the street." After a while, the Western friend pointed to the green worms hanging up and down the trees on the side of the road, and the spider webs in the air with surprised insects on the ground. What is the meaning? The old man replied again: "This is the silkworm rearing of the Insect Bureau, because foreigners are transporting silk to China, and in the future these natural silks will be used to resist it." The Western friend began to nod and praised: "China is worthy of being a country that pays attention to agriculture."

A friend of the old man plans to work in the post office and relief agency. The friend asked the old man which of the two is the least likely to lead to unemployment. The old man advised him to join the relief agency. The friend asked the reason, and the old man pointed to the street beggar and said: "This kind of work can never be finished."

The old man said: "In the city, if you want to judge a young man, you only need to let him manage money without checking his accounts, and at a certain time, you can put him to death"!

A certain county magistrate, A, wrote a couplet on his door that said: "Love the people like children, enforce the law like a mountain." The old man continued it with: "Love the people like children, cattle and sheep parents, granary parents, just perform their duties as children. Enforce the law like a mountain, hiding reality in it, accumulating wealth in it, is this the nature of a mountain?"

The old man and the leader of the troops were neighbors. The leader used a servant who was stupid and lazy. There was an old-fashioned teapot in the room, which the leader liked very much; one day he told the servant to carry the pot to make tea. After a long time, the servant brought a pot without a lid. The leader asked why he didn't put the lid on. The servant replied that he had broken it. The leader said angrily: "Why didn't you break the pot together." The servant immediately took the pot out and smashed it. The leader became even more angry and beat him and fired him. The old man heard about it and said: "How difficult it is to be absolutely obedient."

Here and Now

### Bean Paste Steamed Bun

— Wen

The mayor made a wonderful metaphor at the council meeting and said: "On the one hand, we must take into account the needs of the people, and on the other hand, we must take into account the burden of the people. The city government and the council are like sandwiches sandwiched in the middle."

The lives of Shanghai's four million citizens are all weakly and messily rolled together, surrounded on the one hand by the heavy burden of high prices, high interest rates, heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, and on the other hand, they must take into account the international city scene. The citizens of Shanghai are like bean paste steamed buns wrapped in the middle.

### Ideals! Reality!

— Fang

The people in the countryside near Shanghai have mostly fled, one by one being swallowed into the mouth of Greater Shanghai.

"The tillers own their land" has been the ideal of those in power for many years. "Land with no one to till" is the current reality in the countryside.

Ideals and reality, may they one day walk the same path!

### National Essence

— Fang

After Shanghai eliminated the "eating-corner tigers" (a type of gambling), fortune-telling stalls arose to replace them, and recently even the large and small thirty-six kinds of stalls have sprung up in response.

This is a new trend of the people transforming from being infatuated with Western ways to advocating for the national essence.

### Expensive Pork in the Year of the Pig

— Wen

As soon as the Year of the Pig arrived, the price of pork in Shanghai rose to four thousand eight hundred yuan per catty. Fortunately, among the four million citizens of Shanghai, at least more than half "have not tasted meat for three months." So what does it matter what the price of pork is?

Besides, the United States is also experiencing a meat shortage!

### Water Beggars (Part 1) – The Predecessors of Water Rats

— Huang Jiamo

The "Water Rat" gang that runs rampant on the Huangpu River has a considerable background. They have deep-rooted historical origins, and are skilled in treading waves and stirring up water, and are active underwater. Stealing cargo from ships, breaking into cabins, cutting mooring lines, and other tricks are all commonplace for them. Although the police have been actively arresting them recently, it is difficult to completely eliminate them in the short term due to the gang's wide connections and numerous resourceful members. Upon investigation, the predecessors of this "Water Rat" gang were the "Wandering Five Lakes," "Playing Green Dragon," and "Water Comb Thoroughly" gangs that were active in the Three Xiang and Seven Lakes regions. During the Qing Dynasty, they already occupied an important position in the Jianghu gangs. In order to understand the predecessors of the "Water Rats," I will patiently and carefully describe what I have learned from inquiries.

Initially, the "Wandering Five Lakes" gang rowed a kind of small boat, specifically begging from "bottom-of-the-barrel" (boats too) docked at the shore. They were "water beggars" and originally belonged to the "Playing Green Dragon" gang. "Playing Green Dragon" was a type of gang that performed and sold their skills on the water, similar to the "Offering Celestial Spirits" gang that performed on land. They just branched out like the army and navy.

The small boats rowed by the "Playing Green Dragon" gang had small ends and a large, bulging middle, shaped like an olive or a large duck egg. They swayed on the turbulent Yangtze River, appearing very dangerous. An old man sat at the stern, holding a small paddle and rowing, while a child, about thirteen or fourteen years old, stood on the bow. Both boys and girls wore tight short shirts and pants, were barefoot, and had their hair tied into a small bun with two red and green flowers inserted in it. The old man whistled while slowly rowing the boat into the crowd. People on other boats would naturally peek out of their windows to watch. The old man would say a few "opening lines," and with a shout, the child would flip and turn on the small bow, which was only about two feet square, performing various tricks while the boat swayed dangerously. If someone threw money into the water, the child would immediately dive in to pick it up. During the Mid-Autumn Festival Stone Lake incense gathering in Wu County during the Qing Dynasty, "Playing Green Dragon" was the time to make money. Unexpectedly, one or two children always died each year. After Magistrate Zhu issued a ban, the "Playing Green Dragon" business suffered a blow and gradually declined. Those who remained dispersed to other places and no longer necessarily "went to the market." They usually just performed miscellaneous tricks at the boat docks to earn enough money to feed their families, a very pitiful situation. When the children turned sixteen, their bodies became stiff and they could no longer make a living in this way, so they had to switch to "Wandering Five Lakes," which was one of the reasons.

However, teaching children the skills of "Playing Green Dragon" was a very difficult task. Because they had to do "waist monkey," "somersaults," "inverted cauldron" (commonly known as hitting the...), "wind circle" (turning around in a circle) and other skills on a boat and a fragile wooden plank without falling, and then practice boat skills before not falling into the water. Only after they had mastered the skills would they practice their underwater abilities. They had to be able to open their eyes in the water and see things in the water so that they could "fish for needles" (pick up money). Only one or two out of ten children could succeed. Some died during practice!

Spring and Autumn

### The Growth of a Writer

— Fu Jun

In the realm of literature, whether it is creation, criticism, or translation, if one wants to achieve a brilliant and immortal achievement, it is of course unavoidable that one must have several parts of talent and the influence of the literary environment out of ten. In addition, first of all, one must have a strong will. This is a great driving force that can promote the writer to embark on the road to growth. Literary critics and writers of ancient and modern China and foreign countries have all achieved amazing success because of their strong will. Those sacred masterpieces, even after hundreds of years, are still cherished by the public, regarded as treasures, and it can be said that they are all based on having a strong will. The great French writer Anatole France began his literary life when he was in his teens and continued until his death in Tours on October 12, 1924. He lived a long life of eighty years and devoted himself to literary work wholeheartedly and never slackened. This strong will is really worthy of imitation by today's literary workers. Mr. Lin Qinnan of our country, as an ancient prose writer who originally did not understand foreign languages, translated The Camellia Lady by the French writer Alexandre Dumas fils after accidentally hearing others' oral accounts, which was welcomed and praised by countless people. This aroused his interest in translation, and he successively translated more than 150 kinds of novels by famous European and American writers. The great works of famous writers from countries such as England, France, the United States, Russia, Greece, Norway, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, and Japan, such as Shakespeare, Dickens, Scott, Alexandre Dumas père, Alexandre Dumas fils, Washington Irving, Tolstoy, Aesop, Ibsen, Weiss, Cervantes, and Tokutomi Kenjiro, were all translated into Chinese by him and introduced to China. His strong will and his unwavering dedication to literature are truly admirable.

In addition to having a strong will, the growth of a writer requires rich life experience. Because literary creation is originally a reflection of various aspects of real life, if there is no rich and enthusiastic life experience, then this writer will not be successful. The famous Russian short story writer Chekhov once said in a letter to his friend Suvorin: "What I write is only my experience... The reason why you and I are outstanding is that you and I like to be close to ordinary people." Famous writers such as Dostoevsky were exiled to Siberia; Gorky used to be a rag picker, a mechanical pattern maker's apprentice, a cook's assistant on a steamer, a lawyer's clerk, and also wandered around. Zola went to the coal mine himself in order to write about the situation in the coal mine. Serafimovich, in his article How I Wrote "The Iron Flood," tells us how he obtained the material for the novel. He said: "I also found those comrades who had marched with him, and I interrogated them like a judge, asking them one after another; after listening to one person, I went to ask the second, the third, and even the tenth. Later, I got a diary - a diary kept by a worker during this march - and so, by referring to the statements of those who had personally participated in this march, I created a true scene of this movement. Sai · Telezhkov worked with Deng Xihua, the protagonist of the book, a journalist, for six months while writing "Deng Xihua." Pilek read more than 30 books on river and sea engineering in order to write a novel called "The Vova River Enters the Caspian Sea."... These facts can all illustrate that the growth of a writer, in addition to a strong will, must also have deep life experience, otherwise, his works will not be easy to achieve both form and content, and be popular with the people.

In the process of a writer's growth, since he has a strong will and rich life experience, he must also know how to "observe" and "imagine" at any time and in any place. Since the object depicted by literary creation is the reality of human life, then for the various postures and personalities of human beings, one must observe them carefully with keen eyes. Gorky said in his "My Creative Experience": "In order to accurately describe a portrait of a worker, a priest, or a small businessman, one must carefully look at his hundreds of priests, small businessmen, and workers." Dickens was most sensitive to "observation." No matter how bustling a street he walked through, he could tell the order of the shops on that street and the various details of how they were decorated. These are all examples of writers' "observation." But we know that observation belongs to the external world, and we must also examine our own inner world and taste the similarities between the personalities and behaviors of human beings, so as to describe the thoughts, feelings, and impulses of the characters. In this way, we must seek help from "imagination." One day, Tolstoy and Turgenev were walking in the wild and saw an old frightened horse passing by. Tolstoy was immediately infected by the horse's emotions and had a strong "imagination." He then vividly described his sad memories. For example, from other kinds of human actions, we can also use our "imagination" to achieve the purpose of deep description in literary works. Therefore, "observation" and "imagination" are indeed indispensable and important factors in the growth of a writer.

### Waterwheel (Oil Painting)

— Wang Wei

### Remembering Yu Pingbo

— Lin Hui

Every middle school student has probably read the two beautiful and lingering articles, "The Qinhuai River in the Sound of Oars and Lanterns." These were written by Zhu Ziqing and Yu Pingbo when they traveled together in Qinhuai, and they became a popular literary anecdote.

Zhu Ziqing has already returned to Beiping, and his recent mood can be seen from "Miscellaneous Notes on Returning." Yu Pingbo has been living in seclusion in the ancient city, so his news is relatively quiet. Although I have recently seen his two articles published in Ta Kung Pao, "Casual Remarks on Poetry" and "A Simple Explanation of Qingzhen Ci" in "The Analects," they are all critical works, and it is difficult to get a glimpse of his life and state of mind.

Mr. Yu is very short, wearing a pair of deeply nearsighted glasses. The snuff-colored old woolen hat is covered with dust, and the blue cloth gown has been washed countless times. Anyone who meets him for the first time will be surprised by his simplicity and lack of pretense. He is slightly hunchbacked, and his pace is neither fast nor slow, fully revealing a gentle and refined demeanor. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he has a very deep old literati atmosphere.

Whether he is speaking or lecturing, he often grabs the gray hair on his temples with his fingers, which has almost become his habit. And what can best convey his thoughts and wisdom is his bright and radiant eyes, which emit a rational and sincere brilliance. From this, one can understand his ethnic areas and silently read thoughts that are more beautiful than his writing can describe.

He is an introverted person who does not like to talk grandly. He is always immersed in thought. His silence often evokes a feeling of reverence, making one feel that all gorgeousness, exaggeration, and boasting are nothing but a pile of garbage and some burdens. At the same time, his fondness for silence also explains why his articles contain many profound philosophies.

He is a poet, an essayist. His poems are ethereal and natural; his essays are restrained and solemn, with a bit of astringency. If Zhu Ziqing is compared to Yuan Zhonglang of the Gong'an School, then Yu Pingbo is Zhong Xing and Tan Youxia. In any case, his early works, "Yan Zhi Cao" and "Miscellaneous Flavors," have to be said to be the most stylish works of modern prose. Half of the style is due to his talent, and half is due to the completion of his personality; this is why we always hope to see the person in person after reading someone's work. Sometimes, we can get more inspiration from observing his personality and life.

It is a well-known fact that Yu Pingbo left the position of new literature and moved towards the classics. So he made textual research on "The Analects," gave a simple explanation of Zhou Qingzhen's poems, and explored the musical theory and palace shang of the songs. New creations are rarely seen; this is Yu's loneliness, and it is also the loneliness of the literary world. If going into the classics was an unavoidable escape during the dark eight years, then it is now time to change course. In this turbulent era, the young group is so eager for some seniors to say a few sincere words as their spiritual pillar; they are so eagerly waiting for those who tend to the truth to shoot out a ray of light to pierce the vast darkness...

### Short Poems

— Lan Ben

Insects

Use antennae as feelers

Use feelers to seek women

Use women to fill up with nectar

I am an insect

I live in the beehive of an urban apartment

Train

Departing from the station…

A giant with a blue, smoky pipe

Followed by

Air filled with the foul odor of nicotine

The noisy clamor of passengers

Departing from the station…

The newest, Dadaism,

A train full of the pain of the end of the century,

The train of life departs,

Spraying blue smoke from my hands…

### Fragments on Poetry

— Lin Feng

Poetry is the sound of the human heart. When there were people on earth, there was also poetry.

Poetry was a popular art in ancient times, but later it was locked in a greenhouse by some literati and elegant scholars, and separated from the people of the earth. It seems that only they understand poetry, are worthy of talking about it, and are worthy of creating it. In fact, they have stained poetry and put heavy shackles on it.

At that time, when it was imprisoned by the literati, a huge voice rang out among the people, and that was folk songs.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 143

— Ye Jingfeng

It is said that according to the traditional legend of the Black Dragon Society, when a member is dying, whether it is seppuku or suicide due to violating the law, they must shout the slogan "Kyo Kyu Kyu Kyo" (恐急糾舉) in order to be considered an eight-stringed, awe-inspiring, earth-shattering heroic act. Otherwise, they would be scolded as "killers" or "killing material," which would be cowardly and far removed from this official "sacred death" method.

In addition, there is another interpretation of these four words, that is, when high-ranking figures in the society have hardships, their subordinates, upon hearing this emergency command, must desperately move forward and sacrifice everything at all costs, only seeking to protect this high-ranking figure.

The above three interpretations cannot cover everything, but generally speaking, this underworld slang is somewhat of a bad thing, and seems to be closely related to the matter of "death."

So, which type of emergency command did Tsurumi receive? Was he told to quickly commit seppuku? Or was he told to commit suicide? Or was he told to desperately move forward to protect Konoe?

"Mr. Nishihara," Tsurumi stood up straight and struck a military at-attention pose, "I apologize for arriving in a hurry and not bringing my tools. I am empty-handed…"

Tsurumi certainly knew what this emergency command generally meant. However, in this sudden incident with rapidly changing events, it was impossible to be absolutely sure whether this "Kyo Kyu Kyu Kyo" was telling him to risk his life. In addition, that Nishihara was naturally a double-sided face (無表情) no matter what, with no expression on his face. Although he seemed to be in a hurry, he didn't seem to be bringing reinforcements. So he used the words "no tools" to test him and see how he would answer, so he could understand the intention clearly: if Tsurumi was to commit seppuku, then according to the rules, he would have to use his ancestral Japanese sword bestowed by our country; if he was told to commit suicide, he could sneer, "As you please." Apart from these two, no matter what tools he was told to use, pistols, school swords, Chinese swords, etc., he could be sure that he was being told to kill the enemy and achieve results.

"Tagusan, Tagusan!" This is the Japanese pronunciation, meaning "there are many"; that is, it means that Beppu's "tools" are of various kinds and have everything. "The enemy's challenge specifies judo or kendo. It is believed that there are excellent ancient swords here, and you can choose whatever you like."

Tsurumi completely understood this, not only understood, but also calmed down; because competing in judo and kendo was originally a smokescreen in Tsurumi's plan; it could be seen that Konoe had fallen for his trick; in other words, he had fallen into the trap. To go one step further, this meant that his subordinates had completed seven or eight tenths of the work of searching for the "Seven Secret Letters" according to plan. He had to personally take the stage for the remaining two or three tenths.
