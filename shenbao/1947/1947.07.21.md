### Wedemeyer Special Envoy Leaves Honolulu, Will Fly Directly to Nanjing via Guam, Plans Trip to Shanghai After Deployment in Nanjing

[United Press Nanjing 20th] The US Embassy officially announced today that, according to a recent telegram from General Wedemeyer, he is scheduled to fly directly from Guam to Nanjing around 4 pm on the 22nd.

[Central News Agency, This City] According to reliable sources from the US military here: General Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly directly to Nanjing from Guam by military plane tomorrow (22nd), without stopping in Shanghai. Key US military personnel stationed in Shanghai have all received orders to fly to Nanjing by special plane tomorrow morning to welcome the special envoy and hold discussions. The US military also stated that General Wedemeyer is flying directly to Nanjing because he urgently wants to meet with Chairman Chiang and other government officials. After completing the deployment in Nanjing, he will take time to visit Shanghai. This is General Wedemeyer's third visit to China. In 1944, he succeeded the late General Stilwell as Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in China, and his contributions were well-known. After the victory of the war, when the US military headquarters was established in Shanghai, he returned to the United States for a while, but soon returned to Shanghai. He was recalled to the United States in the summer of 1946. This time, he was ordered to come to China again to inspect the current general situation in our country. He has been unanimously welcomed by the government and various parties. It is reported that Mr. Wedemeyer will stay in our country for more than a month to discuss various related issues in detail with the government authorities. In addition, Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Qingdao by flagship at 3 pm this afternoon (21st). People from all walks of life in China and the United States in this city, because Admiral Cooke has been away from Shanghai for a long time, have prepared to welcome him. According to a spokesperson for the US Naval Electrical Authority here: It has not yet been decided whether Admiral Cooke will go to Beijing to meet with General Wedemeyer. It is reported that Mr. Cooke will stay in Shanghai for six days and return to Qingdao by the original ship on the 27th.

[United Press Honolulu 20th] General Wedemeyer stated on the 20th that the delegation he leads to study aid to China is not subject to any kind of restrictions. He issued this statement to clarify his remarks on Friday to the press. The explanation was that "aid from the Marshall Plan may be extended to China and Korea, including all areas under Soviet domination." Wedemeyer's publicity consultant, Watson, stated that the delegation would study the situation in the East for at least six weeks, and its actions would therefore depend on the results of its research. Watson stated that General Wedemeyer cannot make statements about his hopes or intentions. The entire study will be an "objective study." Wedemeyer's party is scheduled to leave here by US Army transport plane on the 20th to China.

[United Press Nanjing 20th] Observers here believe that after Wedemeyer arrives in Beijing, he will not consult with Chinese officials for at least the first two days, except for formal meetings. Instead, he will convene advisors and embassy staff, including Ambassador Stuart, to focus on listening to recent reports to begin the investigation. This work may be limited to evaluating the reports provided by the National Government and the US Embassy. Some people speculate whether Chairman Chiang will invoke the precedent of treating Marshal [George] Marshall in the past and invite the special envoy to go to Kuling. It is believed that Wedemeyer, in view of the implications of Marshal [George] Marshall's experience, may stay in Beijing for the summer to avoid hindering his mission of conducting an impartial investigation.

[This Newspaper] With General Wedemeyer's arrival in China imminent, the government has specially invited Zhang Junmai, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, to go to Beijing for consultations in order to gather opinions from all parties. Mr. Zhang has accepted the invitation and is scheduled to go to Beijing today with Xu Chuanlin and Ji Yiqiao. Before his departure, Mr. Zhang stated: After General Wedemeyer arrives in China, we should frankly tell him the actual situation of our country's politics, military affairs, and economy. This will be helpful to the overall situation.

[Reuters Nanjing 20th] Amid government preparations to receive General Wedemeyer, it is widely rumored again among political and business circles that the Executive Yuan will be reorganized soon. Informally, it is said that the government will make changes to the personnel of the Executive Yuan, including the internal transfer of Dr. Gu Weijun to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs, the transfer of Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to serve as Minister of Education, and the appointment of Minister Chen Lifu as Minister of Social Affairs, in order to cooperate with the implementation of the General Mobilization Order. More and more Chinese people are gradually agreeing with the views of American newspapers, believing that although Wedemeyer is a friend of China in times of trouble, he will not bring a large number of items needed by China this time. His main equipment will only be a blank notebook. It is reported that various government departments, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Resources Committee, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, will submit reports to Wedemeyer separately. The reports of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will involve the peace treaty with Japan and the opening of trade with Japan.

### General Du Yuming Arrives in Shanghai, Lung Disease Relapses, Will Go to the United States for Treatment, Talks About the Situation in the Northeast Becoming Stable

[This Newspaper] Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security, is about to go abroad for treatment. He left Shenyang for Ping on the morning of the 19th, and flew from Ping to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, arriving at Jiangwan Airport at 4 pm. Accompanying him were Mr. Du's wife, six sons and daughters, Zhang Tingmeng, Commander of the Air Force of the Northeast Military Region, Yu Jizhong, President of the China-Soviet Daily, etc., and he brought a doctor to take care of him on the plane. Representatives from military, political, party and group circles in this city went to the airport to welcome him, including Zhang Bide, representative of Mayor Wu, Shen Xiaofeng, representative of Commander Xuan, Xiang Changquan, representative of Speaker Pan, Fang Zhi and Xie Renzhao from the Municipal Party Department, and Xi Yushu from the Municipal Council, etc., more than 200 people. Mr. Du was wearing a blue silk robe, white socks and black cloth shoes, his face was pale, and beads of sweat were like beans on his face. After being supported off the plane by attendants, he first shook hands with representatives from all walks of life, and then Shanghai ladies Liu Deming and Song Minzhi presented flowers on behalf of the Friends of the Army Society. Because Mr. Du was weak due to illness and could not stand in the sun for a long time, he was immediately carried into a car on a stretcher and driven to the Dahua Hospital on Baojian Road for rest. The hospital sent two nurses to the airport to take care of him at that time. Mr. Du is going abroad for treatment this time because of a relapse of his old lung disease. At the same time, his legs were chilled due to directing operations outside the customs, and he has not yet recovered. Therefore, he needs to go abroad for treatment. There is still about a week's delay in handling the formalities for going abroad in Shanghai. It has not yet been decided where to go in the United States, and how long to stay will depend on the condition of the disease. As for his wife and sons, they will stay in Shanghai.

This reporter then visited Mr. Du at Dahua Hospital to inquire about the current situation in the Northeast. According to him, the situation in the Northeast has been quite stable since the victory in Siping Street, and the Communist bandits will not have the strength to launch a fourth offensive in the short term. The Communist bandits have a strong force in the Northeast because they have a backstage to supply food, salaries and ammunition, but compared with the National Army, they are still inferior and are only of a roving nature. There are Korean communists and Japanese prisoners participating in the bandit army. The number of Korean communists is at least more than 100,000, and the Japanese prisoners are only 4,000 or 5,000. Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, in terms of land, the Communist bandits occupy about one-half, in terms of population, the National Army area occupies three-fifths, and in terms of resources, 80% of the production area is in the hands of the National Army. The general popular sentiment and morale in the Northeast are very good. Regarding the rumors that there are still Japanese troops in the Changbai Mountain area refusing to surrender and resisting stubbornly, Mr. Du said that he could not confirm it. He believes that it is impossible for Japan to rise again in the Northeast. The reporter asked whether the general public in the Northeast missed Zhang Xueliang. Mr. Du said, "They have almost forgotten him." Mr. Du also said that his trip abroad was purely for recuperation and there were no other tasks.

As far as the Democratic Socialist Party is concerned, we may not participate in practical work. Regarding the universal election, the negotiations in Beijing, I believe that there may be results in two weeks or ten days. There should be no problem with this example election." When asked whether there is any possibility of reconciliation in the internal disputes of the Democratic Socialist Party, Mr. Zhang said: If the Innovation Committee can be cancelled, there is still a possibility of reconciliation.

### National Army Crosses the Wen River in Separate Routes, The Battle of Yanzhou Has Won Preliminary Victory, The Remnants of the Communist Bandits Are Encircled and Annihilated in the Plains

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 20th] The Western National Army, which went south from the Tai'an area, occupied Anjiazhuang on the 19th and crossed the Wen River on the 20th, marching towards Ningyang. The Eastern National Army also joined forces with another unit of the National Army after recapturing Dawenkou and crossing the Wen River, and is now encircling and attacking the bandits on the periphery of Yanzhou with the Southern National Army.

Also, more than 15,000 Communist bandits from the First and Second Columns of Ke Bocheng's troops and the Yellow River Detachment launched a fierce attack on the city of Wenshang on the evening of the 19th. The defending troops fought back calmly. By the morning of the 20th, the Communist bandits suffered more than 5,000 casualties and collapsed, leaving more than 3,000 bodies.

[This Newspaper, Yanzhou, 20th] In the Battle of Yanzhou, the National Army has won a preliminary victory. Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng attempted to converge on the periphery of Yanzhou and strike a blow to the National Army in southwestern Shandong. They did not expect that because they were far away from the mountainous area, they were like tigers entering the plains, giving the National Army a good opportunity to annihilate them. In addition, the fertile land of southwestern Shandong is a vast plain, which is an ideal environment for the activities of mechanized troops. The distance between Yanzhou, Jining and Zouteng and the rear of the National Army is also close, and trains and highways can reach directly, so supplies and reinforcements can be obtained easily. Therefore, when the reporter visited a military observer on the 20th, he was greeted with a smile, and told that although the National Army had given up the outer strongholds such as Wenshang, Yang, Jiaxiang, and Juye due to strategic needs, the Jining offensive and defensive battle that started on the 17th had annihilated more than one column of Communist bandits, with more than 20,000 casualties. The Communist army on the periphery of Yanzhou was attacked by the National Army from the north and south, and the casualties also exceeded 10,000. The encirclement of Jinxiang and Yangshanji in the northwest has been lifted, and the losses of the Communist bandits are at least more than 20,000. If the losses in the Battle of Zou Bing are included, they should be at least 60,000. It is not an exaggeration to call it a great victory.

[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 20th] The Jining offensive and defensive battle is fierce. More than 50,000 Communist bandits from the First, Third, and Tenth Columns of the East China Field Army and the Seventh Column of Liu Bocheng's troops launched a fierce attack on Jining again on the night of the 19th. The defending troops fought back bravely, and the battle was tragic. They are still fighting.

### British Newspaper Comments on the Chinese Situation: Believes the Soviet Union Plans to Seize Xinjiang and Drives the Chinese Communists to Create a Chaotic Situation

[Reuters, London, 20th] The Conservative Party's highly respected "Yorkshire Post" published a lengthy editorial on the Chinese situation, believing that the Soviet Union harbors ambitions to covet Xinjiang Province in China, all of Central Asia, and even areas within the Indian border. The newspaper pointed out that in recent years, the trade of Xinjiang Province has mostly developed westward via the Turkestan Railway, rather than taking the six-week journey through the Gobi Desert to reach Peiping. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet Union will eventually find a way to seize Xinjiang. In addition, the Soviet Union also intends to use the Chinese Communists as a vanguard to occupy all of the three eastern provinces. The newspaper urged China to eliminate the Marxist faction and the Kuomintang reactionaries to thwart the Soviet Union's schemes and alleviate the suffering of the people. The newspaper said, "China is indeed in a state of suffering. The eight-year war has destroyed the entire administrative system. Although the individual qualities of its cabinet members are better than those of previous governments, experienced and trustworthy officials are still rare. The Communist Party's claim that they are the 'only friends of the peasants' has been proven false. The Chinese Communists are clearly doing their best to create chaos and suffering to overthrow the National Government and establish their own position in the ruined state. We still recall that in Chinese history, when a dynasty collapsed, the chaotic situation was similar to the situation in China today. The difference is that today's China must learn the new political methods of the West. More importantly, it must eliminate the two stubborn factions of Marxists and reactionaries. These two factions disregard the interests of the country and continue the war to achieve their own ambitions."

### The Truth About the Recent Fierce Battle Between Gao Shu-xun and the Communist Bandits

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 20th] According to reliable sources: The reason for the fierce battle between Gao Shu-xun and the bandits was that Gao failed to borrow money from the bandits in Changzhi. He then confiscated the branch of the Southern Hebei Bank and surrounded the pseudo-Special Commissioner's Office. The Communist bandits arbitrarily massacred Gao's cadres. In a fit of rage, Gao occupied their production workshops, confiscated local armed forces, and appointed administrative personnel. To suppress the incident, the Communist bandits urgently transferred two brigades from northern Henan, commanded by Chen Geng, to surround Gao's troops. Gao also gathered his troops and launched a fierce battle with the bandits.

### Preliminary Meeting of the Conference for Peace with Japan Convened: Soviet Union Expresses Refusal to Participate, United States Strongly Advocates Signing a Peace Treaty with Japan Soon

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 20th (Broadcast): According to the Soviet Embassy in the United States, the Soviet Union has refused to participate in the peace conference with Japan initiated by the United States. The U.S. State Department has acknowledged this statement.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Although U.S. officials encountered setbacks from Britain and its dominions in the first session, they still expressed their utmost determination to advocate signing a peace treaty with Japan soon. At the same time, the United States expressed disappointment that it could not begin action next month because Britain, Australia, and New Zealand were scheduled to hold a meeting in August to discuss the same issue. However, U.S. experts believe that they have already received a fundamentally hopeful response to the U.S. invitation.

On the other hand, it is said that, except for the Soviet Union, the other ten countries involved in the matter have agreed in principle to proceed with the Japanese peace treaty. U.S. public opinion also strongly supports this action. The Netherlands has unconditionally accepted the U.S. invitation. Authorities said that the French ambassador had indicated that his government had no major difficulties with the matter, and it is believed that the Philippines, China, and Canada largely agreed.

The United States, which must bear the cost of the occupation of Japan, believes that although Japan must still be under Allied control for military matters, the time is ripe for Japan to become economically and politically self-reliant.

The U.S. Congress will release new evidence indicating a growing trend in favor of this policy. The emergence of this trend can be seen in the House Appropriations Committee's consultation on the cost of the occupied areas. For example, the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Engel, criticized: "Japan and Korea are indeed no longer countries that pose a military threat. What is the benefit of occupying Japan? So why not conclude a treaty with them, stay out of it, and let them manage their own affairs?"

[United Press, Washington, 19th] It is rumored here that an Australian official statement said: The Australian Prime Minister said that Australia will participate in the preliminary meeting of the eleven countries suggested by the United States to discuss the peace treaty with Japan.

### Impressions of a U.S. Journalists Delegation on Japan: Has Democracy Sprouted in Japan? Believes the Japanese are Not Deceiving the Allies!

[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] Ten American news editors who visited Japan at the invitation of the U.S. Department of the Army returned to Tokyo on the 20th after inspecting various parts of Japan and are scheduled to go to Korea on the 22nd. Reporters accompanied them on their inspection of various parts of Japan and learned their impressions as follows: According to informal suggestions from British and American sources, the Allied control organization after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan should be composed of the chief diplomatic representatives of the countries of the Eleven-Nation Far Eastern Commission. A gathering of chief diplomats is more important than other types of control organizations because diplomats have extensive experience in these matters and are not easily swayed by external pressures. It is hoped that the United Nations can establish a certain military organization not only to take necessary military precautions when the terms of the Japanese peace treaty are being discussed.

Almost all the prominent figures who met with the U.S. journalists agreed that a war between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is impossible. Most Allied leaders in Japan believe that the Japanese people are sincere in cooperating with MacArthur. Some countries are deeply afraid that the Japanese will deceive the Allies with false friendship, but this concern is excessive. There are now various reasons to believe that democracy is indeed sprouting in Japan, that the Japanese can indeed become a peace-loving nation, and that they can be a model for Asian countries! Some authorities are deeply afraid that Japan will compete with Britain, America, and other countries in the international market, but they do not know that Japan's exports can be restricted so that it cannot engage in unfair competition with other countries.

### Experts on Japanese Issues Hold a Symposium in Shanghai

Discussing the Issue of a Peace Treaty with Japan

[Local News] Xu Yiqiao, president of Transformation Publishing House, and Fang Qiuwei, editor-in-chief of Asia Century Monthly, in view of the upcoming convocation of the preparatory meeting for the peace conference with Japan, specially invited experts on Japanese issues to hold a symposium on the peace treaty with Japan at the publishing house yesterday (the 20th) at 4:00 PM to promote the attention of people from all walks of life. Wang Yunsheng, Shao Yulin, Liu Baimin, Zhou Changshou, Li Qiusheng, Luo Dunwei, Meng Xianzhang, Wu Juenong, Cui Wanqiu, Song Yuelun, Zhao Nanrou, and more than a dozen others attended, with Xu Yiqiao chairing. The content of the symposium focused on the following issues: (1) The fundamental policy of the peace treaty with Japan, (2) The time and place of holding the peace conference, (3) The territorial issue of Japan, (4) The issue of reparations, (5) The issue of restoring Japan's international trade, (6) The issue of Japan's control after the establishment of the peace treaty. The experts spoke very enthusiastically. They all believed that the peace treaty with Japan would determine the overall situation in the Far East for the next century, that the government should be fully prepared, that the people should pay close attention, that the basic policy of the peace treaty should be based on the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, and that Japanese militarism should be thoroughly eliminated economically, politically, and ideologically to ensure world peace. As for MacArthur's proposal to hold the peace conference in Tokyo, all the experts expressed their opposition. The symposium ended at around 8:00 PM.

### Legislators Xiao Zheng and Huang Yuanbin Discuss Opening Trade with Japan: Our Country's Industrial and Commercial Circles Focus on the Nanyang Market

[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 19th] Since Supervisory Committee member Yu Shude and others suggested temporarily suspending the opening of trade with Japan, all parties have paid close attention to it. Yesterday, reporters visited legislators Xiao Zheng and Huang Yuanbin to inquire about their views on the matter. Both agreed that there was no need to be overly concerned.

Xiao Zheng's Opinion

Mr. Xiao went to Japan before the war and is very knowledgeable on Japanese issues. According to him: The resumption of Sino-Japanese trade is only a matter of time. Although some people oppose trading with Japan before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, they do not oppose trading with Japan. In this era of international free trade, China is willing to supply Japan with a considerable amount of raw materials. Some people oppose transporting salt and soybeans to Japan, but this is not necessary, because if our country has a surplus, it can be transported to Japan. Regarding the transportation of Japanese goods to China, we oppose Japan recognizing China as the end of its shoddy industrial products and dumping easy-to-sell goods to China in political or improper ways. We do not want to excessively suppress normal Sino-Japanese trade. Mr. Xiao believes that Japan is currently working hard to restore its light industry, but as we observe it, Japan should first try to restore its agriculture and agricultural processing before discussing the restoration of industry. When the reporter asked what impact the opening of Japan's international trade would have on our country in competing for the Nanyang market, Mr. Xiao said: As far as the future industrial outlet of our country is concerned, we should pay great attention to the Nanyang market and hope to maintain a considerable proportion in quantity. The authorities' previous prohibition of transporting cotton yarn to Nanyang was actually unfavorable to us. Finally, Mr. Xiao hoped that our country's industrial and commercial circles would work hard to improve manufacturing technology so that they could compete with Japan in the international market. Chinese talent has always been second to none, and it is also more convenient to obtain machines than Japan. Although there are currently "high wages" restrictions, costs can be reduced after the economic situation improves. If the government can also find ways to reduce the restrictions on the industrial and commercial circles, then foreign trade is not without a future.

Huang Yuanbin's Opinion

Mr. Huang's opinion is largely the same as Mr. Xiao's. He believes that our country adopts a managed trade policy, and the types and quantities of imported and exported goods are all stipulated. Only those that are allowed to be imported can be imported, and the quota cannot be exceeded. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about opening trade with Japan, because our country's trade policy will not suddenly change due to Japan's opening to foreign trade. The current situation is very different from before the war. Currently, our country's taxes are autonomous, so there is no need to worry too much about the past. Mr. Huang believes that the Nanyang market issue is more important than the Sino-Japanese trade issue, and said that the problem today lies in Nanyang, not in China. He pointed out that we have always attached great importance to Nanyang, but this depends on the extent of our efforts, because Nanyang is not our land, and the acquisition of its market depends on our efforts.

Zhu Xie's Speech

[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 20th] Zhu Xie, Deputy Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance and a member of the business inspection delegation to Japan, said regarding the opening of Japan's foreign trade: From a general point of view, this measure of the Allied Headquarters is to exchange what one has for what one needs and reduce the burden on the occupying forces, so it is not unreasonable in principle, but if it is considered in light of the facts, the measures decided by the Allied Headquarters are too unfair. First, the U.S. dollar is used as the currency for transactions, and second, the export of luxury goods is the main focus, which is extremely unfavorable to us. He meant that it is okay to open trade with Japan, but the measures of the Allied Headquarters must be thoroughly revised, otherwise, who would be willing to do a business that benefits only one side?

### Employees of the Changyuan Levee Restoration Form a Suicide Squad to Rush the Repairs: Working at the Risk of Death Under the Encirclement and Attack of Communist Bandits

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 20th] The work of restoring the levees in the Changyuan area by the Hebei Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is extremely difficult due to the attacks and disturbances by Zhang An, the pseudo-Magistrate of Dongyuan County, and Cao Mazi, the pseudo-District Chief. Of the more than fifty team leaders, including Su Yushan, who were abducted by the Communist bandits a few days ago, twenty-six have returned to work, while the whereabouts of the rest are still unknown. Most of the employees stationed on the levee are currently disguised and lurking in wheat gauze tents beside the levee. As soon as the Communist bandits leave slightly, they continue to work. To encourage employees to rush to repair the danger, three volunteer suicide squads have been specially organized to carry out the repair work at the risk of death.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th] Wang Guorui, Chief of the Second and Third Engineering Sections of the Qinhe River Repair and Defense Office of Henan, arrived in Zhengzhou on the 17th evening from the north of the Yellow River. According to him: The Communist bandits attacked Heledian, which belongs to Wuzhi, on the afternoon of the 16th. Two-thirds of the seventy-odd employees of the engineering section have fled to Miaogong Village, east of Wuzhi County and west of the Pinghan Road, near the north bank. The whereabouts of the remaining personnel are currently unknown. The levee sections at Donghongqiao and Wuchekou on the south bank of the Yunhe River west of Wuzhi are extremely fragile and need to be repaired urgently because they were breached before. The banks and defenses of Zhuyuan Village and Muleidian east of Wuche must also be built, but the village of Donghongqiao is under the control of the Communist bandits, making construction very difficult. Now Muleidian has been attacked again, and the project cannot be carried out. If a major flood comes, and the levee body of Muleidian is breached, the Pinghan Road will be seriously threatened.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 20th] According to news from the Shandong Repair and Defense Office: (1) Three teams of the Zhukou Engineering Team of the Yellow River's south bank levee repair project have temporarily withdrawn to Gaocun. Because Liuzhuang and Gaoling were invaded by the Communist army, they retreated to Maodian on the 18th and planned to rush to repair the dangerous works there. (2) Five teams of the Linpu Engineering Team are temporarily concentrated in Xingji and have contacted the Henan Repair and Defense Office to rush to repair dangerous works there. (3) The staff of the western office of Luxi and Linpu have all withdrawn to Kaifeng. (4) The materials and engineering team equipment stored in the Linpu section have all been looted by the Communist bandits and transported to the north bank of the Yellow River.

### Continued Breaches in Various Rivers in Southern Liaoning: Water Conservancy Bureau Sends Personnel for Survey

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 20th] It is raining again in southern Liaoning, and the rivers continue to breach, increasingly destroying rural fields.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] After the Liao River flooded and caused disaster, the area within twenty li of Yingkou has become a swamp. Haicheng is the most severely affected and widespread disaster area, with the affected area accounting for about six-tenths of the county's area. The Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau has sent four groups of personnel to conduct on-the-spot surveys, one group heading east to the Bohai River and the Taizi River, one group heading west to the Raoyang River and the Liao River, one group heading to the central part of the Liao River and the Sanjiangkou, and one group heading south to Yingkou Zhishan and other places. In addition, the water level of the Songhua River in the north is also rising, but the situation is not as serious as that of the Liao River.

### Heavy Losses to Rong City's Flood-Affected Manufacturers: Statistics Reach 25 Billion, 100,000 Farmers in Western Sichuan Homeless

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 20th] The industrial sector has suffered the most severe losses after the flood here and is now facing a total collapse crisis. The Western Sichuan Industrial Association released statistics on the 20th, stating that the assets of public and private manufacturers throughout the city have lost 25 billion, with the Xin Xin, Yuhua, and Baoxing yarn factories being the most severely affected. Xin Xin No. 4 Factory was completely destroyed, losing more than 6 billion, and all work has been suspended. The association telegraphed the Four Joint Banks on the 20th, requesting an emergency loan of 10 billion to help resume work.

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 20th] After the flood in western Sichuan, more than 100,000 farmers were homeless. For the sake of relief, the provincial government specially allocated 3 billion in agricultural loans for emergency relief on the 20th in conjunction with the Rong City Farmers Bank. Xiang Chuanyi, Speaker of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, and Tang Zhaoming, Deputy Speaker, flew to Beijing on the 20th after inspecting the disaster in Neijiang and other counties to report the disaster in detail to the central government.

### Editorial: The Question of Japan's Opening to Foreign Trade

According to a statement from General MacArthur's headquarters, Japan's private foreign trade will be opened starting August 15th. Our government has yet to express its attitude on this matter. At the State Council meeting on the 18th of this month, Foreign Minister Wang's report on the Japanese peace treaty issue did not mention the opening of Japanese trade. Business circles in Tianjin and Shanghai have been feeling uneasy for days, believing that opening Japan's foreign trade at this time would be more harmful than beneficial to our country. Supervisory Committee member Wan Can and others, seeing the seriousness of the situation, have loudly appealed to the government to stop considering opening trade with Japan and to suspend sending a business delegation to Japan. This appeal has attracted attention from all sides. August 15th is approaching in the blink of an eye. We not only cannot stand idly by regarding the development of this matter, but should also pay close attention to it and further devise appropriate countermeasures.

The opening of Japan's private trade was jointly announced by the U.S. State Department and the Department of the Army on June 8th. General MacArthur further announced this plan in detail the following day. According to MacArthur's statement, private foreign trade with Japan will be partially restored from August 15th. After that date, Allied and neutral country merchants will be allowed to enter Japan, limited to 400 people. The so-called preliminary restoration of international trade on August 15th does not mean a complete restoration of free international trade. All commercial negotiations will be mediated by the Allied Headquarters and guided by its International Trade Group. Regarding the 400 trade merchants, according to the resolution passed on July 3rd by the Trade Association with Japan under the Far Eastern Commission, the 400 people include 102 from the United States, 60 each from China and the United Kingdom, 39 from India, 27 from the Netherlands and Indonesia, 23 from Australia, 16 from France and Vietnam, 8 from Canada, 6 from New Zealand and the Philippines, and none from the Soviet Union. The United Kingdom, the Philippines, Australia, and India did not feel interested in this decision. The Australian government firmly stated that Australia would not restore private trade with Japan before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. Australia's attitude is quite clear, has foresight, and has a method. We wholeheartedly resonate with it.

Japan's domestic business community is not only celebrating and congratulating the United States for this "significant," "wise" "decision," but also expressing "gratitude." They are looking forward to the "old days" of 1934, and are witnessing China's disappointing current situation. For months, they have been overjoyed, formulating various trade plans, especially for exports to China, deciding on a huge surplus of more than 51.6 million US dollars, including exports: (1) Machinery: 30,000 bicycles, 40,000 air cylinders, 100,000 watches, 100,000 cameras, 500 motors, 30,000 spindles of textile machinery, as well as locomotives and agricultural tools; (2) Fiber: 175,000 boxes of silkworm seed paper, 9,800 bales of rayon, as well as pottery, paper, wood, and glass; (3) Agricultural products: miscellaneous grains, aquatic products such as shark fins, sea cucumbers, and abalone, all totaling 4,964.365 thousand yen, equivalent to 99.28 million US dollars. As for imports, the goods purchased from us include 600,000 metric tons of salt, 360,000 metric tons of sugar, 370,000 metric tons of soybeans, 900,000 metric tons of coal, 400,000 pounds of animal hair, 890,000 pounds of cork and licorice, 340,000 pounds of sea grass, and 60,000 pounds of beeswax, 30,000 pounds of茯苓, totaling 2,384.092 thousand yen, equivalent to 47.6 million US dollars. Comparing the two values, the trade surplus to China is 51.68 million US dollars. Thus, the so-called restoration of private trade with Japan is simply the restoration of her pre-war supermarket in China.

Analyzing the content of this Japanese trade plan further, it is obviously extremely unfavorable to our country. First, the trade is based on US dollars. Does our country have that much foreign exchange? Moreover, our country's foreign exchange is controlled by the government. How can private trade be discussed? Second, most of the goods Japan imports into our country are inferior, and many industrial products are pouring in, which may destroy our national industrial production. The future is truly unimaginable. Third, what Japan needs are all our country's industrial raw materials or daily necessities for the people. At present, there is unrest in our country, and disasters are everywhere. We are already facing a shortage of materials ourselves. How can we supply Japan's huge needs? In particular, the current cost of our country's export materials is very high. If trade is restored and MacArthur's headquarters does not calculate according to the actual cost, our country's business community will inevitably suffer huge losses. All of this is possible. In short, from the perspective of trade itself, the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade is more harmful than beneficial to our country, and the associated technical difficulties are numerous. We have very few reasons to explain why our country needs the restoration of trade with Japan at this stage. Looking further ahead, the remnants of Japanese militarism have not been completely eliminated. If she is allowed to continue to play an important role in the Far Eastern economic circle, not only will the Southeast Asian market gradually restore its monopoly, but the result will inevitably threaten the entire world and ancient peace. Is it only China that will be affected?

Standing from the position of the Chinese people and the position of safeguarding world peace, we agree with the attitude of the Australian government. We believe that China does not need to open trade with Japan before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan and the settlement of the reparations issue. Only after the reparations issue is resolved and the peace treaty is signed can private trade between China and Japan be restored!

### Political Assassination in Burma

On the morning of the 19th, a shocking political assassination suddenly occurred in Burma. Because traffic between Rangoon and the outside world was completely interrupted, the details of the incident have not yet been reported in detail. However, according to an announcement by the British Burma Office, in addition to the death of Burmese Interim Government Deputy Chairman Aung San on the spot, six other ministers also died at the same time. The news spread to the capitals of various countries, and all were shocked, not only expressing regret for Burma's loss of a political leader, but also expressing concern about the future of Burma's political situation.

After World War II, Burma was refined by nationalism and激盪by the world's trend, demanding independence and autonomy, which is sympathetic to anyone. Aung San led the Burmese people to achieve the goal of Burmese independence through peaceful means and negotiations, which is also admired by the world. In January of this year, Aung San led a delegation to London to negotiate with the British authorities and put forward three demands: (1) Britain declares Burmese independence; (2) Organize a Burmese national government; (3) Hold universal suffrage and convene a constitutional assembly. After a long negotiation, the Anglo-Burmese Agreement was signed. After returning to the country, Aung San actively carried out universal suffrage. The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League he led won an unprecedented victory. The Constitutional Assembly has been in session since it was established in April, and has begun its constitutional work there.

However, on the other hand, the Anglo-Burmese Agreement failed to immediately establish Burma, which aroused the dissatisfaction of some people, especially the radical Communist Party, which not only formed its own Red Flag Army, but also colluded with the 100,000 "Revolutionary Army" of the First Alliance for Burmese Independence, attempting to riot in the country. Observers have long been worried about Burma. Therefore, although we do not know the details of this political assassination, we can see from the trajectory of the development of the Burmese political situation that the occurrence of this incident is only a superficial manifestation of the struggle between the two major parties in Burma.

Post-war Burma has suffered great trauma. Whether it is to achieve immediate independence or to go through a transitional period of self-governing territory, what the Burmese people urgently need at present is domestic stability. Only in stability can progress be achieved. Therefore, the occurrence of this terrorist assassination, in any case, is harmful and unhelpful to the future of Burma.

### Hong Kong Establishes Checkpoints on All Sides: Strictly Arrest Smugglers

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Hong Kong is a major base for smuggling in South China. Importers, exporters, and overseas Chinese remitting funds engage in smuggling activities through various means, either to evade losses from official exchange rates or to import luxury goods that are difficult to obtain. The customs authorities have repeatedly devised countermeasures for this purpose. Recently, they have established branch checkpoints on all the small islands around Hong Kong. If ships sailing from outside Hong Kong cross this boundary without reporting, they will be arrested for smuggling. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective.

### Overseas Chinese Compatriots in Southeast Asia Recover: Life Gradually Becomes Stable

Liu Weizhi to Visit Overseas to Offer Solace

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] A spokesperson for the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission recently issued a statement on the general situation of overseas Chinese affairs after the victory of the War of Resistance. According to the statement, the situation of overseas Chinese affairs in the Americas is generally good because it was not affected by the war. As for Southeast Asia, it was severely affected by the war. After the war, the Commission and relevant agencies assisted overseas Chinese in their recovery. Although their businesses have not been able to restore to their pre-war appearance, their lives have gradually become stable. In the past two months, overseas Chinese groups and compatriots from various places have been eager for Chairman Liu Weizhi to go abroad to inspect and improve overseas Chinese affairs, and have sent numerous letters and telegrams. Once the Commission's newly revised organizational plan and funding and other basic issues are resolved, Liu will personally go overseas to offer solace to overseas Chinese and inspect overseas Chinese affairs. Moreover, staff will be dispatched to guide some regions in three to five countries in the near future. A request to purchase foreign exchange is currently being submitted.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Du Lizhu, who transformed from a famous Kunqu opera performer into a movie star and is currently playing the lead role in the film "Tianqiao" being filmed at the China Film Corporation's Third Studio, reenacted attempted suicide by swallowing gold but survived. Several months ago, Du faced a lawsuit for falling in love with a fake air force officer who repeatedly committed fraud. Recently, she became involved in a love triangle because of a certain Mr. Wang, and as a result, she was abandoned by the fake air force officer she was madly in love with. Temporarily distraught, she reenacted swallowing gold a few days ago and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Because it was kept secret at the time, few people outside knew about it. Yesterday, she was picked up by Mr. Wang, who had abandoned her, and continued filming the film "Tianqiao."

### Public Servants in Kang Province Request Increased Salaries

[Our Newspaper, Ya'an, 20th] Prices in Kang Province are higher than in other parts of the country.

The monthly income of ordinary employees can only buy two dou of rice (each dou costs 170,000 yuan). Amidst the rising prices, the salaries of public servants in the border province are too meager and it is difficult to make a living.

### Coup Erupts, Seven Cabinet Members Die Tragically; Former Burmese Prime Minister Arrested; New Cabinet of Thakin Nu Sworn In

[Reuters, Rangoon, 20th] The new Administrative Committee led by Thakin Nu, Speaker of the Burmese Constituent Assembly and Deputy Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, was sworn in today. All six members are members of the Anti-Fascist League and survived yesterday's assassination attempt. The situation in Rangoon is calm today and is under the complete control of the authorities. Government offices are operating as usual, and public sentiment is gradually stabilizing.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 20th] Unofficial reports indicate that more than 80 suspects have been arrested in connection with the assassination of Burmese government leaders. At the same time, Meng Pang, the Regional Counselor of the Burmese Administrative Committee who was injured in yesterday's attack, died of his injuries this morning, bringing the total number of deaths to seven, with one injured.

[United Press, London, 20th] The Burmese Office reported on the 20th that two hours after the assassination of Burmese Interim Government Prime Minister Aung San and five cabinet members, former Prime Minister U Saw, leader of the Myochit Party (National Party), and 19 members of his party had been subjected to "protective detention." It is reported that British police officers engaged in a gun battle with U Saw's men before storming his residence. Three of U Saw's subordinates were shot and killed. Police officers found many rifles and submachine guns in U Saw's residence. Burmese sources here are divided on whether U Saw or the Communist Party was responsible for the attack. Those who believe that the Communist Party committed the crime point out that Aung San declared most of the Burmese Communist Party an illegal organization in June. On the other hand, U Saw, who leads the extremist nationalist faction, advocates complete independence from Britain and therefore strongly opposes Aung San.

### The Course of Political Assassination in Burma

[Reuters, London, 19th] During a routine meeting of the Burmese Administrative Council (Burma's interim government) at the Rangoon government office today, a group of thugs broke in and opened fire with submachine guns, killing six Burmese government leaders and wounding two others on the spot. News of the assassination was telegraphed to the Burma Office in London tonight by the Governor of Burma, Sir Rance. Communications to and from Rangoon were cut off for several hours after the incident. The Governor's report stated, "As the Administrative Council was in session, a jeep drove to the front gate of the government office. Five men jumped out, armed with several submachine guns and two rifles, and rushed upstairs to the conference hall. One person remained on guard in the jeep. A guard with a gun outside the conference room tried to stop them but was severely wounded by the thugs and unable to speak. Three of the men with submachine guns entered the room and opened fire on the leaders present, then returned to the jeep and fled. The deceased were identified as Vice-Chairman of the Administrative Council, Aung San; Minister of Commerce and Supply, Ba Win; Minister of Education and Design, Ba Saik; Minister of Industry and Labor, Mahn Ba Khaing; Minister of Finance, Thakin Mya; and Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications, Ohn Maung. The wounded were identified as Minister of Information, Ba Cho; and Frontier Councilor, the chief of Mahn Gon area. The dead and wounded have been rushed to the General Hospital. The situation is being handled by the police. So far, there have been no reports that the police have fully controlled the situation. Further details will follow." The identity of the perpetrators is currently unknown.

Note: The Burmese interim government is composed of fourteen members, mostly from the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League led by Aung San. Aung San is a prominent leader in Burma. In January of this year, he led the now-deceased Thakin Mya, Ba Pe, who had already left the government, and Tin Tut, who maintained an independent stance, to London to sign an agreement with the British government to establish a self-governing government in Burma. Tin Tut is now in London and has been appointed as Burma's High Commissioner to the UK. The Burmese delegation at the time also included the leader of the Dobama Asiayone party, U Saw, and the leader of the Sinheba Wunthanu party, Thakin Ba Sein, who refused to sign the agreement. Upon returning from London, U Saw and the other leader declared their opposition to the agreement and withdrew from the government. In recent months, the Burmese Administrative Council has enjoyed full cabinet powers. The Burmese Constitutional Assembly is drafting the constitution for the self-governing government and recently passed a resolution declaring Burma's independence from the British Commonwealth. The majority of the assembly members are from the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. The Speaker of the Assembly, Thakin Nu, is Aung San's right-hand man, and is denounced by the Communist Party as "a tool of British imperialism" and "a traitor to the working class." The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League is a coalition of ten parties, and in May 1945, it announced that it had 100,000 members. Its military forces fought alongside the British army against the Japanese and were called the Burma National Army. Initially, the ten parties included the Communist Party, but after the Communist Party's newspaper attacked the League's policies and refused to apologize, the League's Supreme Council decided on November 3, 1946, to expel the Communist Party from the League. The League's other parties are the People's Revolutionary Party, the Dobama Asiayone Party (Nationalist Party), the Burma Fabian Society, the Thakinwun Party, the Burma Youth League, the Greater Burma Party, the Sanghas Association, the Women's Freedom League, and the Burma National Army. Governor Rance broadcast tonight, announcing that he has appointed Constitutional Assembly Speaker Thakin Nu to establish a new Administrative Council. Thakin Nu's position in Burma is second only to Aung San. The Governor also condemned the violence and urged the Burmese people to remain calm and follow the path to independence laid out by their leaders.

The King's Condolences

[Reuters, London, 20th] The King and the government have sent telegrams expressing their sympathy to the Burmese government officials who were killed. Prime Minister Attlee, Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma Henderson, and Secretary of State for Burma Lord Listowel have all sent telegrams to the Speaker of the Burmese Constitutional Assembly, Thakin Nu. Attlee also sent a telegram to Aung San's wife. The King sent a telegram to the Governor of Burma, Rance, expressing his deep grief, recalling the pleasant meetings he had with Aung San and Thakin Mya in London in January, and asking him to convey his condolences to the families of the victims and wish the injured a speedy recovery. The British government's telegram stated that it was deeply shocked and expressed its sincere sympathy to the Burmese government and the families of the victims. Aung San's death has deprived Burma of one of its greatest leaders and public servants. The British government also hopes for the speedy recovery of the injured.

British and American Attention

[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] "The New York Times" and "The Herald Tribune" both published the news of the assassination of Burmese Prime Minister Aung San and his five ministers on their front pages. Reports from London indicated that the communists were responsible for the assassination. At the same time, the two newspapers also prominently published the news of the assassination of Lyuh Woon-hyung, who once served as the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Korean Provisional Government in exile in China. Lyuh was considered a prominent non-communist leftist figure in Korea. The newspapers stated that the Communist Party was also suspected of the murder in this case, as Lyuh had strongly opposed communist control and had faced strong opposition from extremist elements among his colleagues.

[United Press, London, 19th] Burmese political circles here say they believe that the assassination of Aung San and five other cabinet members was carried out by the Burmese Communist Party, as Aung San had recently declared most communist organizations illegal. In addition to the communists, Aung San's political opponents also opposed his liberal policies. These extremist nationalists opposed Aung San's recent concessions to British demands.

Aung San's Brief Biography

[Reuters, London, 20th] Aung San, the Vice-Chairman of the Burmese interim government who was assassinated yesterday, was 32 years old and a powerful figure in Burma. The Burmese people praised him for liberating Burma twice. In 1942, he helped the Japanese in their war. Later, realizing the Japanese plot, he turned to help the British fight against the Japanese and became an anti-Japanese leader. He enrolled at Rangoon University in 1933 and became the President of the Rangoon University Students' Union in 1936, leading a nationwide strike movement. Last year, he launched a nationwide strike against the British military occupation of Burma. The Burmese government had no choice but to compromise with him and reorganize the Administrative Council. The Communist Party therefore denounced him as a tool of British imperialism.

### Former Japanese Mandated Islands, US Military Government Ends

US Announces Provisional Trusteeship Measures

[United Press, Washington, 19th] White House announced today: President Truman has signed the trusteeship agreement, by which the United States manages the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific, and has appointed General Denfeld as the temporary administrator. Denfeld is the Commander of the US Pacific Fleet and will administer the islands as High Commissioner, pending the takeover by government civil administration agencies. The trusteeship agreement was adopted by the United Nations Security Council in April of this year and subsequently approved by Congress. In addition to signing the agreement, President Truman issued an order prescribing provisional management measures for the trust territory. This management began on the 18th of this month, the date the President signed the joint resolution of both houses. The trust territory consists of the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands, all of which were seized by the United States from Japan in the later stages of the war. The President's order authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to implement temporary management while stipulating that the power "to close any area for security reasons" granted to the United States in the trusteeship agreement shall be exercised jointly by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of State. In addition, the order stipulates that the Secretary of State shall oversee all relations between federal agencies and corresponding agencies of the United Nations regarding the trust territory. The military government in the trust territory has been declared terminated by order. According to the agreement, the United States must enact laws to implement the prescribed programs. President Truman stated that he has instructed the State Department to compile legislative recommendations, which are expected to be submitted when the next Congress convenes.

### Indonesian Situation, Cloudy but No Rain; Indonesia Asks to Reopen Peace Talks; Nehru Expresses Resolve to Support Indonesia

[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Indonesian government sent a letter to the Dutch Commission in Indonesia today, asking them to meet with Indonesia to peacefully resolve the outstanding issues, or to agree to appoint a chairman from a third country (to be selected from the consuls-general of China, Britain, the United States, and France stationed in Batavia) to arbitrate the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia. The Republic of Indonesia today also asked India to prepare a memorandum to submit to the United Nations Security Council, based on the grounds that the Indonesian situation threatens world peace. Reports from Yogyakarta said that Nehru, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Indian interim government, has stated that he will personally support the policy of the Indonesian government to maintain the de facto status of the Republic. Republican officials believe that India will strongly support Indonesia in the event of a war between the Netherlands and Indonesia.

Mediation by Various Countries Fails

[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] Efforts by Britain and other allied countries to mediate and get the Indonesian authorities to issue a ceasefire order before noon today have failed. The Indonesian Prime Minister called from Yogyakarta, saying that his cabinet could not reach a resolution as scheduled because Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Setyadjit, who was traveling by train from Batavia to Yogyakarta with the Dutch proposals, had not yet arrived by 11 a.m. this morning. A Republican spokesman blamed the Dutch for not providing an airplane for Setyadjit to travel on, causing the delay.

Dutch Deny Launching War

[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Dutch-Indonesian government has stated that the Dutch have no military intentions and refused to discuss the possibility of war. A spokesman for the Dutch-Indonesian government acknowledged that Governor-General Van Mook had received a reply from The Hague, but pointed out that this did not mean that Van Mook was able to order military action. Another Dutch spokesman strongly denied reports that the Dutch government had ordered Van Mook to take military action, and that Van Mook had replied that he did not intend to launch it before Tuesday.

Indonesia Appeals for International Intervention

[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Indonesian Republican government decided last night to urgently appeal to Britain, India, Australia, and the Arab League to intervene to prevent a war between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The Indonesian government has instructed its representatives in New Delhi, Singapore, and Canberra to submit the aforementioned requests to Nehru, the British Special Envoy to Southeast Asia, Killearn, and the Australian Foreign Minister, Evatt. At the same time, Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir said in Yogyakarta that he felt that the Dutch attitude had made it impossible for Indonesia to reconsider its position. He was especially disappointed that there was no response from the Dutch to his broadcast calling for a ceasefire.

Dutch Military Commander Suddenly Resigns

[Reuters, The Hague, 19th] According to newspaper reports, Lieutenant General Spoor, the Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch forces in the Dutch East Indies, has resigned to the Dutch government because "the military situation in the Dutch East Indies has become unbearable," but the government has retained him.

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 20th] Indonesian Deputy Foreign Minister Tamzil said here today: The Netherlands wants war. I firmly believe that they will soon attack the Republic of Indonesia. It is puzzling that the Netherlands is willing to bear the burden of a colonial war when it is in such a difficult situation. Indonesia still hopes that the current dispute can be resolved peacefully. We have accepted four-fifths of the Dutch proposals. It is unreasonable to say that the remaining one-fifth, which concerns the issue of organizing a joint Dutch-Indonesian police force, is sufficient justification for attacking Indonesia. When asked about Indonesia's resistance capabilities, Tamzil said that Indonesia has a total of 250,000 soldiers, but they cannot effectively resist a large-scale Dutch offensive in an organized manner. The Dutch army is well-equipped, and Indonesia has no choice but to adopt a scorched earth policy.

### International Telecommunications Conference, Outer Mongolia Not Allowed to Participate

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] At the plenary session of the International Telecommunications Conference held in Atlantic City yesterday, a vote was held to oppose the admission of Outer Mongolia as a member state. Thus, Outer Mongolia has not been able to gain international recognition as an independent republic. Yesterday's vote was 32 to 26 against Outer Mongolia's admission, with nine countries abstaining. At the same time, the conference voted 46 to 45 against the admission of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, with ten countries abstaining. The conference stipulated that a country applying for membership must obtain a two-thirds majority vote for approval. The Soviet Union supported the admission of the three Baltic states and Outer Mongolia. The conference took this action based on the recommendation of the Credentials Committee, which originally recommended that Outer Mongolia be allowed to attend the conference, but Spain and the three Baltic states should not be allowed to participate.

[Agence France-Presse, Atlantic City, 19th] At today's plenary session of the International Telecommunications Conference, a vote of 36 to 21 rejected Spain's application for membership.

### Bevin Explains British Policy, Says Britain is Planting Seeds of Peace

[Reuters, Amble, Northumberland, England, 19th] Foreign Secretary Bevin addressed 50,000 miners and their families here today, believing that there is no danger of another war in this generation.

He said: "I sincerely believe that the differences of opinion and suspicions between us and the Soviet Union can eventually be eliminated. We must find ways to unite the United States and the Soviet Union to work together to save all of humanity. Britain is now striving to plant the seeds of peace, and everything depends on the will of the people. Although the British government has a clear reputation, it is facing a difficult task internationally. As Foreign Secretary, I am always fully aware that a wrong decision or judgment, or even a willful response, will not only harm this generation, but will also harm children 30 or 40 years later. However, as far as I can see, there is no danger of another war in this generation. I am not discouraged by the difficulties of the past." Bevin continued: "It has been said that I intend to use Marshall's proposal to rebuild Germany, which is not the case. Germany's recovery must be achieved through the general recovery of the European economy. Although a standard must be established and maintained during this process, there are two things that affect us all: how security can be ensured, and what level of German industrial production should be allowed to maintain to prevent German workers from being arbitrarily exploited by unscrupulous people, thereby lowering the living standards of the European people. We must prevent the exploitation of the European people or the lowering of European living standards. This balance must be maintained. We know that the Ruhr coal mines are the basis for the restoration of prosperity in Europe. At a time when coal is scarce, we should restore normal production in the Ruhr coal mines. France has said: The Ruhr is the source of Germany's military power, how can the Ruhr be rebuilt? France asked with horror: Will rebuilding the Ruhr subject our country to a third attack? We, the British people, must also pay attention to our country's security. We must never face an aggressive Germany again, and we must never allow Germany to become aggressive again. In this, we hope that the United States will never withdraw from Europe." Bevin then told the miners: If you can supply France with British coal, you can rebuild the French economy. During the war, the French economy was adapted to the German economy. After the war, France has not been able to restore its old foundation. One of the reasons is that Britain has not been able to supply France with coal. Finally, he said that it is necessary to break the vicious cycle that binds the world so that the economy can get on the right track. He also hoped that he would not have to borrow money from the United States again, as this is unnatural for both the United States and Britain.

Bevin May Resign as Foreign Secretary to Handle British Labor Issues

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] This week's "World News" weekly reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin may resign as Foreign Secretary and be responsible for handling Britain's labor issues. Bevin handled foreign labor issues during the war, and now that he is resuming this position, he can achieve familiar results. However, Bevin's firm decision will be made after a resolution on the Marshall Plan for European aid is established.

### British and American Economists Observe, Japan Will Fall Into the Arms of the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] Economists from allied countries, especially Britain and the United States, are deeply concerned that Japan, after obtaining a peace treaty, will become the Yugoslavia of the East, first economically leaning towards the Soviet Union, and then politically falling into the arms of the Soviet Union. They expect that after Japan opens up to foreign trade, manufacturers in Western countries will not welcome Japanese goods competing with them, while the Soviet Union can absorb everything that Japan can produce, which will result in Japan's trade automatically leaning towards the Soviet Union.

Looking at pre-war figures, between 1934 and 1936, exports absorbed by East Asia (China, Korea, Taiwan) accounted for 43 percent of Japan's annual exports, and all of Asia, including East Asia, accounted for 64 percent. Asian exports to Japan accounted for 53 percent of Japan's total imports. The United States absorbed only 16 percent of Japan's exports and accounted for only 24 percent of Japan's imports. Raw silk was originally Japan's main export, but since the emergence of rayon and nylon fibers, the United States has not been very interested in Japanese raw silk. As for the Japanese textile industry, it once dominated the world market before the war, but according to Japanese manufacturers' estimates, it will take at least ten years to restore it to the level of 1936-37. By then, India and China will have become strong rivals. Japan's only hope is now pinned on its machinery industry. Korea and China, major customers of Japan before the war, still need Japanese machinery to revive their industries, as well as cheap Japanese goods to supply their large populations. Today, Japan needs food, oil, and cotton, all of which come from the United States. However, it is expected that after the occupation ends, MacArthur withdraws from Japan, and international trade finds its level, the food, cotton, and oil that Japan needs will pour in from the Soviet Union, just across the sea. And Japanese goods will not be difficult to find sales channels in the Soviet Union, so Japan will eventually fall into the Soviet Union's economic sphere of influence.

### MacArthur May Participate in the Next Presidential Election

[United Press, New York, 19th] The issue of General MacArthur participating in the presidential election is still being discussed in political circles. It is said that since the Civil War, there have been five military personnel in the United States who have served as president. Although General Eisenhower has repeatedly denied it, observers believe that Eisenhower has a strong intention to be elected president. In addition to Eisenhower, MacArthur also seems to have signs of participating in the 1948 presidential election. If a peace treaty with Japan is concluded, MacArthur's prestige will inevitably increase, and he will return to the United States amid cheers. It is expected that MacArthur's return will be around March next year.

### British and Indian Simultaneous Announcements, Indian Interim Government Reorganized, Exercising Full Powers Until the Two Dominions are Established

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The British and Indian governments simultaneously issued a statement in London and New Delhi today stating that the Governor-General of India, Lord Mountbatten, with the consent of the leaders of various political parties in India, has decided to establish an Indian interim government, composed of representatives from Pakistan and Hindustan, which will constitute future governments. This interim government will exercise its powers until August 15, when the two Dominions of Pakistan and Hindustan will declare independence. According to sources here, the newly established interim government will enable Governor-General Mountbatten to act more easily due to the cooperation of the future heads of the two Dominion governments, and will facilitate the separation of the two sides on August 15.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 19th] The Indian interim government is reorganized into two committees, representing the governments of India and Pakistan. The two committees will separately discuss matters related to the territory of each government; joint matters between the two governments will be decided by the Governor-General as chairman. The two committees are the two interim governments, and the distribution of their ministers is as follows: For India, Nehru will be in charge of Foreign Affairs, Relations with the British Commonwealth and the United Nations, and Legislation; Patel will be in charge of Home Affairs, Propaganda, and Broadcasting; Prasad will be in charge of Food and Agriculture; Azad will be in charge of Education; Chari will be in charge of Industrial Supplies and Finance; Dr. Matthai will be in charge of Transport, Railways, and Communications; Singh will be in charge of National Defense; Bhabha will be in charge of Mines, Electricity, and Commerce; and Ram will be in charge of Labor and Health. On the Pakistan side, Ali Khan will be in charge of Finance, Foreign Affairs, and National Defense; Chundrigar will be in charge of Commerce, Industry and Supplies, Mines, and Electricity; Nishtar will be in charge of Communications, Railways, Transport, and Propaganda Broadcasting; Ali Khan will be in charge of Health, Food, and Home Affairs; and Mandal will be in charge of Legislation, Education, and Labor.

### Indian National Congress Adopts the Tricolor Flag

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 19th] A unanimous demand for independence and total opposition to Britain has become the party soul of the National Congress under the tricolor flag. All nationalists with different hopes in society and economics have now gathered in the united All-India National Congress. How to use the power of these nationalists to build a modern India is the immediate task. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the National Congress, at today's meeting, will discuss, among several important issues, plans for how to establish and reform India's political, cultural, and social life. It is reported that this plan will include recommendations for modernizing India's national defense and rapidly industrializing India. Regarding the issue of the Indian national flag, it was decided to adopt the tricolor flag of the National Congress (orange-yellow, white, and green), but to replace the spinning wheel in the center of the National Congress party flag with a deep blue wheel. It is generally believed that this change symbolizes the replacement of Gandhi's past ideals of a rural economy with rapid industrialization.

### Connally Expresses Opposition to Expanding the Marshall Plan

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Senator Connally, a Democratic foreign policy expert and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, broadcast an address tonight, opposing the expansion of the Marshall Plan for economic aid to Asia. Connally expressed great skepticism about the success of the Paris Sixteen Nation Conference discussing the Marshall Plan. He said: "I have great doubts as to whether European countries can fully cooperate to implement a joint plan. I have not yet determined whether any future plan is the best and most effective plan to deal with the current situation." Connally also urged European countries to exert the maximum amount of effort for self-help. He believes that Europe must work hard to save itself, and then the United States will be able to easily decide what action to take. Connally also solemnly warned against implementing relief plans that are too costly.

### Anglo-American Disagreement on the Ruhr Coal Issue: Each Side Contends Based on Their National Interests; Britain Seeks French Support

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] Sources familiar with the matter here have stated that Britain and the United States are currently engaged in a friendly but vigorous struggle over the Ruhr region issue. According to official sources, the differing stances of the two countries are as follows: (1) The United States believes that the Ruhr region is key to Europe's recovery and should therefore be given priority. This necessitates the supervision of coal production in the region by American technical personnel, as the United States believes that the efforts of British technical personnel in the region have been unsuccessful. Once the coal issue is resolved, the United States will begin to increase Germany's steel production, at least to restore it to pre-war levels. Some argue that this move will jeopardize security, but the United States does not believe so, as centralization would facilitate control, and in the event of any mishap, atomic weapons could obliterate everything overnight. (2) Britain also hopes to revive the German economy so that the British occupation zone will no longer be a burden on British taxpayers, but Britain does not agree with the ultimate goals suggested by the United States or the methods it advocates. Britain does not believe that its technical personnel are less capable than those of the United States, and it is unwilling to lose control over Ruhr production. Therefore, Britain has refused to participate in the two-nation coal conference in Washington. Britain believes that the ultimate goals proposed by the United States are politically dangerous and contrary to the ideals of all of Germany's neighbors, and therefore opposes them. It should be known that the current plan of the United States is tantamount to risking German competition and endangering the industries of Britain and France. In order to counter the United States, Britain is now seeking the support of France (which has already indicated its support) and British miners.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] The French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, today reiterated to U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett France's opposition to the Anglo-American plan to raise Germany's industrial level.

### The Soviet Union Launches Psychological Warfare; The US Responds with Facts; US Senator Hatch Declares

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] U.S. Senator Hatch, a member of the Democratic Party, stated in a broadcast speech on "Our Country's Foreign Policy" tonight that the United States must respond to the psychological warfare launched by the Soviet Union with concrete facts. If a suitable recovery plan is laid for Europe, the United States should not spare its efforts to aid Europe. This will entail significant sacrifices for the United States, one of which is that our government may need considerable economic management during this aid period. Some say that the United States has economic imperialistic ambitions, which is not true. The sacrifices we will endure will be irreplaceable by anyone. It should be known that the United States only asks other countries to accept democratic principles and protect individual freedoms. Therefore, if they achieve economic recovery, it will be due to the aid of the United States, and they should faithfully abide by the principles of the United Nations.

The US Decides to Assist in the Recovery of Greece

[Reuters, Athens, 19th] The Athens News Agency reported that when the head of the U.S. delegation to Greece, Griswold, was asked at a press conference whether the delegation had a plan to improve the situation in Greece, he replied that the U.S. delegation included both an economic mission and a military mission for this purpose. When asked whether the recovery plan could be implemented while the guerrillas continued to operate, Griswold said that recovery work should be carried out as far as possible in areas where it could be implemented. A communist reporter asked what the U.S. government's attitude would be if the guerrillas established a government in the mountains. He replied that this matter would be decided by Washington, but he did not expect the government to recognize it. Griswold added that the mission was scheduled to last for one year, and he hoped that U.S. military equipment could be transferred to the Greek army immediately. The mission would immediately begin repairing bridges and roads, and restoring industry, commerce, agriculture, and sanitation. He also stated that the U.S. mission was not political in nature and would only engage in recovery tasks.

The compromise plan will be presented to the Constituent Assembly on Wednesday and is likely to be approved by a parliamentary majority, as the opposition's argument is only that the treaty should not take effect before the Soviet Union approves it.

Poor Attendance, Pessimistic Outlook

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations Economic and Social Council held its fifth session this morning. In addition to several representatives delivering pious hopes and encouraging speeches, the Council also approved the agenda proposed by its Rules of Procedure Committee (which includes a total of thirty-nine clauses).

### German Secret Documents Released: The Anti-Nazi Uprising Failed; 5,000 People Were Brutally Killed

[Reuters, London, 19th] The British Admiralty today released German secret documents for the third time, revealing that nearly 5,000 Germans were killed by Hitler after the failed assassination attempt on Hitler with a bomb in July 1944. The Admiralty said that this was a genuine uprising of the German people against the Nazis, but much of the evidence was destroyed by the Nazis afterwards. Propaganda Minister Goebbels even made this widespread uprising be regarded as a dangerous and limited rebellion. People inside Germany at that time had already recognized that defeat was inevitable, so many officials of Stauffenberg's faction planned to assassinate Hitler with a bomb. After achieving their goal, they planned to send General Wiesel to take over the German army, General Fromm, who commanded the domestic army, would be responsible for occupying Berlin, and then General Beck would be ordered to organize the government and sue for peace with the Allied countries. As a result, although the assassination was not successful, some parts of the plan were still implemented as usual. Although Fromm was arrested, the reserve army still marched towards Berlin, and Wiesel also issued an order and declaration to revolt before being arrested. The six months after the assassination were the most terrifying period of the Nazi slaughter of its own people, with about 5,000 people being killed without trial.

### A Rally to Boost Military Morale Was Held Yesterday; Donations Were Enthusiastically Made on the Spot; Shanghai Can Live Peacefully Thanks to the Soldiers at the Front; It is Hoped That Everyone Will Fulfill Their National Responsibility and Respond to Fundraising

[This Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Municipal All Circles "Suppress Communist Bandits to Build the Nation" Ten Thousand Yuan Rally to Boost Military Morale was held at the Grand Theater at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The presidium consisted of Mayor Wu Guozhen, Party Chief Fang Xikong, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, Speaker Pan Gongzhan (represented by Xiang Changquan), Division Camp Commander Chuan Zhengmo, Three Principles of the People Youth League Wu Shaoshu (represented by Cao Jun), Police Chief Yu Shuping, General Labor Union Shui Xiangyun, Chamber of Commerce Du Yuesheng (represented by Wang Xianqing), Farmers Association Hou Ren, Women's Association Tian Shujun, Social Bureau Wu Kaixian (represented by Li Jianhua), Industrial Association Wu Yunchu, Party Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, Civil Affairs Office Zhang Xiaosong, Boy Scouts Council Deputy Director-General Fan Xiaoliu, and Legislative Member Hua Shengmo, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Xinjiang, and others. More than a thousand representatives from all walks of life attended the rally. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

The rally began with the usual ceremonies, and the whole body silently prayed for three minutes for the soldiers at the front who died in the suppression of bandits.

Chairman Mayor Wu took his seat and delivered a speech stating that Shanghai people are busy with industrial and commercial affairs and are far away from the front line, so they may not have a deep sense of suppressing communist bandits and building the nation. But if we think about it carefully, why are Shanghai and the country's economic difficulties increasing day by day? The reason lies in the results of the Communist Party's treasonous rebellion, according to my year of experience in handling affairs, it can be proven that:

The Communist Party Disrupted the Country, Causing Food and Coal Shortages

(1) The food problem, the rising rice prices last year and this year, is due to insufficient production and supply, but how can it be insufficient? The Communist Party occupies Jiangbei. When it was defeated by the National Army, it robbed all the food, ate it all, and destroyed the farmland. The rice of the people in the Jiangbei area could have been self-sufficient, but later they had to purchase it from Wuxi and other places in Jiangnan, while Shanghai's rice supply was mainly supplied by Wuxi, Bengbu, and other places, now it can only supply a part, resulting in a rice shortage. (2) In terms of fuel, the Communist Party used water to bury the Shandong and Zhongxing coal mines, and killed technical personnel who had no political relations, trying to prevent production and disrupt the country. According to the report of the Zhongxing manager last winter, although the re-working machinery and equipment have been prepared, the coal mine dewatering work must be completed in March of this year, so during that period, coal became panic. As for other items such as cooking oil and cotton yarn, they cannot be transported south due to the Communist Party's destruction of production fields and transportation.

But in comparison, the people of Shanghai are extremely lucky and can still live and work in peace. This should be attributed to the soldiers at the front. The soldiers in Northeastern China repelled the Communist army in Sipingjie and prevented the soaring prices in Shanghai, which is a definite proof. Therefore, I hope that the four million citizens of Shanghai can take five minutes to think about whether they should respond to the fundraising to boost military morale and fulfill their responsibility as a national citizen.

We Must Achieve the Goal of 10 Billion in Military Morale Fundraising

Following this, Fang Shengwei delivered a speech stating that if we want to save China and make China peaceful and unified, we must first eliminate the Communist Party. Otherwise, the Communist Party will destroy China, and destroying China will destroy all the world's nations. If we stand by and watch today, we will be sitting and waiting for death in the future. Think about it, if the Communist Party comes to Shanghai, can we still live a peaceful life? The soldiers at the front are now bleeding for us. If we don't express anything, how can we be worthy of them? So we must achieve the goal of 10 billion in military morale fundraising, so that they feel that the people in the rear have not forgotten them, and it is worth fighting and bleeding. In particular, the members of the Chinese Kuomintang should set an example and be the vanguard for the people. The Kuomintang created the Republic of China and led the War of Resistance. Today, it must not sit idly by and watch the Republic of China be destroyed. In addition, I hope that the members of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party will cooperate together, and I hope that the Allied countries, especially the United States, can exert more economic power to jointly achieve world peace. As for those who attempt to undermine our movement with the tail of the Communist Party, we should warn them that these people are the current enemies of Shanghai.

Speaker Pan was invited to attend a meeting in Wuxi, so Secretary-General Xiang Changquan represented him and delivered a speech, elaborating on his experience of personally witnessing the atrocities of the Communist army in Jiangxi and Anhui in 1934. Then Cao Jun, Xuan Tiewu, Hua Shengmo, Fu Zhengmo, and others gave speeches, all hoping that all circles would respond to the military morale movement. Hua also elaborated on the fact that the Communist Party in Xinjiang colluded with a certain country to disrupt the area.

The Rally Resolved to Send Telegrams of Respect

Finally, Mayor Wu proposed that the rally endorse the general mobilization order, send telegrams to Generals Du Yuming and Chen Mingren, as well as the soldiers fighting in Sipingjie, send telegrams to all the Communist bandit suppression officers and soldiers across the country, and send telegrams to the military and political officials in Xinjiang, asking them to defend the territory. Then, Chairman Fang led everyone in chanting slogans before the meeting adjourned.

[Another News] The ten thousand yuan military morale donation fundraising will begin on the 25th, but when the military morale rally was held yesterday, some citizens enthusiastically donated. Mayor Wu reported that the first donors were Lu Jiadong, Lu Jialiang, Li Hongyu, and Sun Yuqing, the workers of Fuxin Broadcasting Company, who donated a total of 200,000 yuan. Then the Grand Theater donated 3 million yuan, the principal of a certain elementary school in Zhabei, Wang Jincheng, donated 50,000 yuan, the director of the News Office of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, Director Li, donated half a month's salary of 150,000 yuan, the monk of Longhua Temple, Xin Ci, donated 50,000 yuan by saving food, the staff of Heping Daily donated 3 million yuan, the 20 district branches directly under the city party headquarters 100,000 yuan, the workers of Tianyi, Tianli, and Tianyuan factories 10,000 yuan each, the Stone Engineering Association 500,000 yuan, and the donations from other groups and individuals were also very enthusiastic.

### Transferred Retired Military Officers; Sixty-One People Serving in Two Roads

There are two batches of transferred retired military officers who have been assigned to the transportation personnel of the two roads for internship. The first batch is 27 people from the Nanjing Central Training Corps, and the second batch is 34 people from the Xi'an Central Training Corps, a total of 61 people. They are divided into three groups: transportation, engineering, and machinery. They have reported to the road one after another and assigned to various units for internship. According to the plan, the transfer of retired officers and soldiers to various national construction work is a pioneering work in our country. The road bureau attaches great importance to these interns. Director Chen specially convened all the transferred military officers a few days ago to give a speech, asking in detail about the past training and current internship situation of each person. Finally, he encouraged all students to continue to work hard in national construction with the spirit of sacrificing for the country in the past.

### Traffic Improvement in Xujiahui; Circular Road Circle Completed

[This Newspaper Report] In order to improve the traffic in the western district of the former French Concession, the Municipal Public Works Bureau opened Kangping Road, relocated the telephone poles on Huashan Road, widened the road surface, and added half of the road surface on Guangyuan Road, making the four roads connected to form a circular road circle. The above project started in mid-May of this year and was completed in its entirety a few days ago, totaling more than 80 million yuan. Since the opening of the five public bus lines by the Public Utility Bureau, the traffic near Jiaotong University in Xujiahui has been busy. The road surface there was originally mostly dilapidated, and the section from Huashan Road to Tianping Road was originally an undeveloped small road. After being improved by the Public Works Bureau, all kinds of vehicles can pass without obstruction on Kangping Road, Guangyuan Road, Tianping Road and the section to Huashan Road.

### Northeast Fellow Townsmen Decide to Comfort the Righteous Army in Shanghai

[This Newspaper Report] More than a thousand members of the Northeast Righteous Army, who had passed through Shanghai from Xinjiang to return to their hometowns, are temporarily stationed at the Jiaotong Railway School, waiting for ships to go to Northeast China.

In addition, all the officers and soldiers of the Northeast Righteous Army yesterday published a letter to the fellow countrymen across the country and a letter to the elders of Northeast China, stating their experience in participating in the War of Resistance and their exile. The article is thousands of words long, passionate and agitated, causing the readers' hearts to ache.

### Indicting Ten French Nationals; Chali and Others Suspected of Collaborating with the Enemy

[This Newspaper Report] During the period when the Japanese enemy occupied Shanghai, ten French nationals in this city, Chali, Aliliyerweng, Dani Aike Wengli, Laolang Gaoyuese, Sikelai, Muniai Aojute, Laodong, Haluo, Chale Aier, and Miulate, participated in the fake German-French Association organized by the French Nazi member TCarcopino as members, propagated German-French cooperation, and attempted to resist their home country.

### Strange Youth at Inn: Mentally Disturbed and Incoherent; Claims to be a Student of National Central University in Nanjing; Whereabouts of the Young Woman He Was Lodging With Remain a Mystery

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Cheng (18 years old), a Hunan native claiming to be a sophomore in the Department of Political Science at National Central University in Nanjing, checked into the Da Jiangnan Hotel on Fujian Road the night before last with a young woman. The hotel staff led them to room 572 on the fifth floor. In addition to writing his own name, age, native place, and occupation in the guest registration book, he also filled in the name Wang Ruizhen, 18 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 87 Sichuan Road, Shanghai, for the woman. He also showed the books and Western newspaper he was carrying to prove his identity. The night passed without incident. Yesterday morning, after the two got up, they went out together. However, when they returned, only Zhang was present. Zhang's face was pale, and he shouted loudly after entering the room. The tea server, hearing the noise, found it strange. About half an hour later, it became quiet again, making him even more suspicious. He secretly went to investigate and saw that Zhang appeared to have taken poison. He immediately reported to the police and sent Zhang to the hospital for treatment. However, after the doctor administered an enema, there was no evidence of poisoning, but it was felt that he was mentally disturbed. Zhang continued to shout. When asked where he lived, he spoke incoherently, sometimes saying Daxia University, sometimes Tongji University, and finally saying he was staying at Fudan University. When asked who the young woman he was lodging with was, he claimed she was a childhood classmate. However, according to eyewitnesses at the hotel that night, there was no doubt that she was a prostitute, as an old woman followed behind the young woman before they checked in.

### Kidnapping Occurs in Jiangwan in Broad Daylight; Victim Released Within Four Hours; Couple Guarding the Secret Room Arrested; The Fugitive Mastermind Once Held a Puppet Military Position

[Reported by this newspaper] At around 12 noon on the 19th, a car suddenly arrived at the Xizhangjiazhai Village in Jiangwan Town. Inside the car sat three plainclothes men and two uniformed men. The men pulled out guns and forced villager Zhang Jingen into the car, speeding away. Afterwards, Zhang Jinfeng, the victim's brother, reported the incident to the Jiangwan Police Station based on information he had received. Upon receiving the report, Chief Ye immediately ordered the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, Shi Junrong, to lead detectives Wen Jun, Li Defang, Inspector Liao Tangqing, police officers Zhu Songliang, Shi Kaitai, and Wang Zhigong to investigate. They learned that Zhang Jingen was being held at No. 14, Lane 484, Tongbei Road. The officers rushed to the location, broke down the door, and rescued the victim in a secret room. They also found a note posted outside the room, which read, "This is an important criminal. No one is allowed to see him. [Signed] Wu Jie." The couple guarding the victim, Qi Jiagen and Qi Xiuying (female), were taken to the station for questioning. They confessed that the mastermind, Wu Jie, was on the run. It is reported that Wu had served as a captain in the Gendarmerie and a company commander in the puppet army during the enemy occupation. Recently, he has been involved in several kidnapping cases. The entire operation, from the kidnapping to the rescue, took only four hours.

### Chairman Fang Hosts Tea Party for Overseas Chinese Tourist Group; Discusses the Situation of Overseas Chinese; Enjoys Very Strict Restrictions on Civil Rights; Severe Rice Shortage Leads to Sharp Increase in Living Expenses

[Reported by this newspaper] The entire group of sixteen members of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps of Selangor who have returned to China to visit the country, namely Zou Wantian, Huang Youguang, Hu Weimin, Wu Hanyong, Zheng Mingpan, Huang Youhan, Ruan Mu'e, Chen Jianqing, Chen Kehan, Liu Wenyan, Luo Changling, Dai Dehuai, Lin Hua, Qiu Youlan, Liu Yanzhu, and Chen Yu , led by Group Leader Liu Xichun, arrived in Shantou on the 29th of last month via the "Haixia" of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from Singapore, and then arrived in Shanghai in three batches by plane. They stayed at the Youth Hostel and have been visiting major construction projects in the city. They are scheduled to attend a tea party hosted by Mayor Wu this afternoon, and then take the train to Hangzhou tonight. After a short stay, they will travel to Nanjing, Beijing, Chongqing, and Wuhan for sightseeing, before returning to Singapore via Guangzhou. Chairman Fang of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters held a tea party at the headquarters at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, attended by more than 20 people from the city's literary, art, and journalistic circles. During the tea party, Chairman Fang gave a speech, expressing his warm welcome and providing a detailed analysis of the current situation at home and abroad. He encouraged party members and corps members to work hard for the country. The guests and hosts had a pleasant conversation and dispersed in high spirits.

The Labor Party's Activities Have Lost Popular Support

The reporter had a very detailed conversation with many members of the group. The main points are summarized as follows: The political life of overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia is obviously different from before the war. Before the war, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia rarely participated in political life. During the war, when various parts of Southeast Asia fell, the Communist Party took the opportunity to promote its cause and organize anti-Japanese armies. After the victory, the government still allowed the Communist Party to continue its activities. Eventually, its actions became out of line, resembling treason. The people saw through their deceit, and they have now greatly lost popular support. Furthermore, before the war, overseas Chinese were heavily oppressed by the British. After the war, China's international status improved, allowing them to enjoy civil rights. However, these civil rights are very strictly restricted. The conditions are that they must (1) have resided in the local area for more than 25 years, and (2) be able to speak and write in English or Malay. Today, most overseas Chinese, especially those of older generations, can speak but not write, so only a small number are able to enjoy the so-called civil rights. After the war, the British took advantage of the local conflict between the Nationalists and Communists, alienating the relationship between overseas Chinese, which greatly affected the unity of overseas Chinese.

Lack of Machinery Leads to Sharp Decline in Production

Secondly, the economic life of overseas Chinese is mainly based on the production of rubber, tin, and mines. After the war, due to a lack of machinery, production has sharply declined, while the cost of living is ten times higher than before the war. Workers are demanding higher wages, making it difficult for employers to cope. The most serious problem is the widespread rice shortage in various parts of Southeast Asia. The Malayan government has implemented a controlled distribution system, requiring 30 catties of rice per person per month, but only 8 catties are allocated. The authorities allow overseas Chinese to freely transport 20% of their needs from Thailand, India, Java, and Burma, but this is still not enough. Workers' wages are entirely determined by the price of rice. As for the culture and education of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, primary schools are the most common everywhere. Children under 20 and over 8 can speak Mandarin. High school is the highest level of education, with only one English university in Singapore.

Women are Conservative, Just Like in the Mainland

There are two Chinese newspapers, the Nanyang Siang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh, which are of higher quality and have fair opinions. There are also two local newspapers, the China Press and the Min Sheng Pao. There are many English newspapers, all run by the British government, which publish as much news about China's war as possible and exaggerate it, which greatly affects overseas Chinese who do not understand Chinese. Women's lives are as conservative as in the mainland, and few women work in society. Finally, they expressed their hope that the country will be unified and peaceful soon. Overseas Chinese are all patriotic and support any political party that is beneficial to the country. Conversely, they will oppose any political party to the end, no matter what it is.

Tao Yishan, the chairman and brigade commander, said in his speech that the volunteer inspectors were all former students of the Public Training School and had made their greatest efforts in the war of resistance. Now, they are assisting the public security authorities and serving the people. Commander Xuan then delivered a speech, explaining the four conditions that soldiers must possess: (1) progressive thinking, (2) revolutionary spirit, (3) upright conduct, and (4) noble character. Yang Hu, Shen Zonglian, and others then delivered speeches. The ceremony ended at around 11:00 a.m. After the meeting, all the members of the team went to the Kangle Restaurant for a meal.

### Flying Disc Appears in Shanghai: Turns Out to Be a Balloon; Mr. Fan Jiakang Gives a Detailed Account of the Investigation

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the mystery of the flying disc's visit to Shanghai, Mr. Fan Jiakang, an American United Press radiotelegraph operator and radiotelegraph operator at the Jiangwan Radio Station, recently wrote: "On the night before last (the 19th), I happened to see a luminous object at the Jiangwan Radio Station, moving from northwest to east, about 10,000 feet above the ground. I immediately called several American soldiers on the scene to watch together, which lasted for about 20 minutes. At first, I thought this object was the recently rumored flying disc, but the American soldiers did not think so, and pointed out that it was a weather balloon. I was half believing and half doubting, so last night I personally went to the U.S. Army Air Transport Station at Jiangwan Airport to investigate the matter. It was said that the station does indeed release weather balloons day and night to forecast the weather, and lights are carried on the balloons at night. Then, after the station inquired with the previous night shift personnel, it notified me by telephone that the station had released a weather balloon at midnight on the 19th. Therefore, I believe that the flying disc said in the newspaper must be a misrepresentation."

### The Day Agricultural Land Reform Is Implemented Will Be the Day the Civil War Is Suppressed; Zhu Ping Broadcasts on National Suppression of Rebellion and Agricultural Land Reform

[Reported by this newspaper] This newspaper held its sixteenth Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Datong Radio Station, inviting Zhu Ping, Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, to broadcast on "National Suppression of Rebellion and Agricultural Land Reform." The following is an excerpt from his speech:

After eight years of arduous war of resistance, our country's rehabilitation work has not yet been completed, and now we have to implement mobilization to suppress the rebellion. This is indeed an unfortunate thing, but in order to protect local order and protect national survival, armed suppression of the rebellion is inevitable. We, standing in the position of a national citizen, can only concentrate our will, unite our strength, and support national policy, in order to pacify the civil war as soon as possible, to shorten the mobilization time to a minimum, and to reduce the sacrifices of suppressing the rebellion to a minimum.

Rural Collapse and Heretical Theories Prevail

Although the factors of the current civil war are quite complicated, its main knot lies in the failure to solve the "peasant problem." Because China is still an agricultural country, the vast majority of the population are farmers, and the most important production is agriculture. Even the industrial workers in the cities and the soldiers in the army all come from the countryside. The security of the regime is closely related to the support of the farmers. Therefore, solving the peasant problem is the key to solving the entire China problem. The core of the peasant problem is the "land problem." Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, put forward the program of "equal land rights" forty years ago as the main goal of the revolution. Twenty years ago, he put forward the policy of "land to the tiller" as a concrete guideline for solving the peasant problem, which had wise foresight. Unfortunately, in the past twenty years, this important national policy has not been effectively implemented, resulting in the collapse of the rural economy and the displacement of most farmers. Heretical theories have taken advantage of this gap to enter, and the vast countryside has been occupied by the Communist Party as a base for launching rebellions. This is the root cause of our country's civil war. Therefore, solving the land problem is the only way to eradicate the source of chaos and stabilize society. If we abandon this and do not plan for it, then I am afraid that we will only make the situation more chaotic.

Liberating the Economy and Improving Living Standards

Solving the land problem was originally a wonderful national policy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Because it has not been implemented for a long time, good farmers have been tempted by heretical theories, and the vast countryside has been stolen by bandits. It is very regrettable to say. Now that we have clearly ordered mobilization and implemented suppression of the rebellion, we should treat both the symptoms and the root cause, and we should focus on the location of the knot and eliminate the source of chaos in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort and achieve a permanent effect. As for the specific strategy for solving the land problem, there is no better way than to implement the land capitalization program (this plan was proposed by me at the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang, and was enthusiastically approved by the congress, and was designated by Chairman Chiang as a key case that must be implemented, and has been ordered by the central government to all relevant ministries and commissions). There are three steps in the process: first, to conduct economic surveys of rural areas and tenant industries; second, to implement joint rent payment and joint rent collection, while adjusting the burden of land taxes; and third, to transfer land funds to industrial funds. The main purpose of this program is to enable farmers to obtain economic liberation, so as to improve their lives, and to have surplus power to engage in improving production. At the same time, financial and technical assistance is provided, and the organization of farmers is guided to engage in collective farming, so as to improve productivity and increase production. On one side, a warehouse network is established so that national food can be adjusted at any time without fear of shortage.

Transfer of Land Funds for Construction

As for the landlord, he can obtain his due land, and at the same time, the government guarantees the principal and interest, and guides him to invest in industry, so that the funds originally stagnant on the land can be transferred to industrial construction. According to my estimation, the total amount of land funds that can be used is very large. If calculated at the current currency value, it can be about 900 trillion yuan. If distributed over a period of fifteen years to use these funds, there will be a huge amount of 60 trillion yuan per year to use this capital in industrial construction. Therefore, the implementation of the land capitalization program can not only solve the land problem, stabilize rural order, and prosper Chengye's production, but also can collect industrial funds to promote the implementation of China's industrialization.

If China's land problem can be solved, then the farmers' lives can be improved, the rural economy can be prospered, and industrial construction can be developed day by day. If the national economy can thrive, then what will the city foxes and social rats rely on, and how can heretical theories enter? The fundamental plan to eliminate the source of chaos lies in this. Therefore, the author said very firmly, "The day when agricultural land reform is implemented will be the day when the civil war is suppressed."

### Special Broadcast Program

Yesterday, this newspaper held its sixteenth special broadcast, starting at 9:00 a.m. Dr. Zhong Zhihe spoke on "Analysis of Symptoms of Tuberculosis Patients," and Lin Lesheng spoke on "Religious Lecture." From 1:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m., harmonica master Wang Qinglong played music. From 2:00 p.m. to 2:50 p.m., Miss Bao Hanying spoke on "Children's Stories." At 4:10 p.m., Lawyer Mi Xitong spoke on "The Legal Viewpoints That Merchants Should Have on Commercial Names." From 5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., Dr. Wang Juerong spoke on "Prenatal and Postnatal Care." From 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., there was Yue opera by the Tongsheng Music Society. From 9:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m., there were major changes to the original program, but the results were even better. For example, Mr. Zhang Zhesheng, Ms. Xian Wen, and Mr. Liu Chunhua of the Datong Radio Station temporarily filled in. Miss Zhu Min sang Fen He Wan, and Mr. Bao Shixian, Zhang Zhesheng, and Fan Shiren sang Selling Horses. Li Qianghua and Sister Weihua sang Wilderness Tears and Trial of the Head respectively. Shen Bainian and Mr. Bao Shixian sang Female Escort, Hu Qin was played by Ni Qiuping and Ruoqi. Miss Fu Ronghua sang Scolding Wang Lang, He Shixi, Zhang Zhesheng, Bao Shixian, and Gu Wen sang Heroes' Meeting, from Jiang Gan Crossing the River to Stealing the Book. Mr. Chen Dezhen sang Hong Yang Dong, and Hou Meisheng sang Ganlu Temple. In addition, the famous Fu Hou Meisheng, the famous Qin Master Zhao Geng, Fu Baoqing Sha Shaochun, have repeatedly helped this newspaper with special broadcasts, sometimes drumming, sometimes playing the strings. At this time, the heat is so hot, and the sweat is like rain, which is especially touching. The address on the guest registration book, No. 87 Sichuan Road, was later found to be fictitious. Also, when the police station investigated, Zhang once said that the woman lived at No. 10 Xiangfen Lane, but when they went to inquire, there was no such thing either. In summary, there are many untruthful things in the previous situation, so the truth is still under investigation.

### The "Lei Zu" of the Scientific Age: Dr. Yun He, the Inventor of "Yun Si," is One of the Few Female Talents in the Industrial World

[Special Feature by This Newspaper] We cannot but admit that in recent years, the scope of Chinese women's work in society and the achievements they have made have been expanding day by day. Not only in education, culture, politics, society, science, law and other aspects have women proved that they are as capable as men in important work, but also in the industrial and commercial circles, there are women leading businesses. Dr. Yun He (pictured), General Manager of China Ramie Industry Company, is one example.

The reason why Ms. Zheng is the General Manager of China Ramie Industry Company is not because she owns family property, opens a large store and hangs up a name to become the boss, but because of the results of her painstaking research on ramie fiber for more than ten years. In 1925, Ms. Zheng graduated from Peiping Women's Higher Normal School, and in 1927, she went to the United States for further study. She studied at Ohio, Michigan, and Chicago Universities in the United States, and obtained a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Ohio University. However, she still felt that her knowledge and experience were insufficient, so she traveled to various places after leaving school to investigate industry. In 1932, she went to Europe for investigation, and in the autumn of the same year, she returned to China and joined Yenching University in Peiping as a professor of chemistry. In 1933, she went to Germany again to practice and study in Berlin University and various factories and schools in German cities. At that time, Ms. Zheng began to study ramie (which foreigners call China Grass because China produces the most), and also used rice straw, sugar cane residue, etc. as raw materials for rayon. She believed that ramie contained high-quality fibers that could be used as textile raw materials, without having to destroy them and then make them into rayon and artificial fibers.

Yun Si Invented and Government Granted Patent

After returning to China in 1936, Ms. Zheng continued to conduct in-depth research. The total fiber was extracted from the ramie by chemical methods, which became something as white and soft as cotton and silk. Ms. Zheng called it "Yun Si" because after tearing it apart, it looked like clouds in the sky. Later, she wove Yun Si into cotton wool, and when the Chongqing Qianchuan Factory held an exhibition, the late Chairman Lin gave it a name called "Snow Spring," which means snow-white, soft, and warm. This "Yun Si" was invented by Ms. Zheng and has been granted a patent by the government. The use of "Yun Si" can be woven into various cloths, wool, summer uniform fabrics, suits or women's outerwear fabrics, sofa covers, cotton wool, etc. When the reporter visited, Ms. Zheng showed the reporter various samples, which were indeed similar to thin woolen serge. The advantages are that it is wrinkle-free, cool, light, and very hygienic due to chemical production. The cost is slightly more expensive than cotton, but less than one-fourth of the price of silk wool.

Plans to Set Up Factories in Various Places for Manufacturing

China Ramie Industry Company was established in April last year with a capital of 200 million yuan. It is assisted by the Central Trust Bureau of the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Bank, the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Association Postal Remittance Bureau, and other enterprises. The chairman is Vice Chairman Sun, representing the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Association. The company has not yet officially opened for business. However, the company already has a manufacturing plant in Chongqing, which can produce three to four tons of "Yun Si" per day. At the same time, offices have been set up in Shanghai, Hankou, Hong Kong, and Guangdong. Currently, due to the ramie harvesting season, the offices are going to Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and other ramie producing areas to purchase ramie, and are preparing to manufacture "Yun Si" in large quantities this winter and hope to sell it abroad. In Guangdong, the provincial government plans to provide machines and factory buildings to China Ramie Industry Company and cooperate with it. This is currently under discussion. In the future, branch factories are planned to be established in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Hankou, and other places.

In addition, Ms. Zheng still has a great interest in rayon. In 1936, she planned to establish the China Rayon Factory, but it was suspended due to the war. However, she said that if she has the opportunity, she still wants to develop in this area.

Family Learning and Husband and Wife Are Like-Minded

Ms. Zheng is from Jinan, Shandong. Her father worked as an engineer in Shandong in his early years, which had a great influence on her interest in science and industry from an early age. The strength of her mother is what has enabled her to persevere for so many years. She believes that a person must have a moral foundation to run a business. Her moral foundation was given by her mother, but unfortunately the old man passed away when she was in middle school. Her husband, Xiong Zilin, is also a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of Berlin in Germany. He is currently the general manager of the Southwest Chemical Industry Manufacturing Plant in Chongqing. They are truly a like-minded couple.

As for the basic reason why she is interested in fiber chemistry, it is because she feels that the use of fiber is too wide. Many things in clothing and supplies are made of fiber, and even the gunpowder used in war is made of fiber. Therefore, it can protect the country in wartime and benefit the country and the people in peacetime. It is necessary to promote this kind of industry. She also said that women must have practical knowledge to be independent. For example, 90% of the manufacturing work such as rayon is done by female workers. The contribution of women to industry and commerce will be amazing, as long as they are given the opportunity.

### Arrested for Hosting a Banquet at the Confucius Temple; Zhang Xiaolong Was Once a Tiger's Accomplice; High Prosecutor's Office Investigates and Files a Public Prosecution

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Qinglong, originally from Nanling, Anhui, later moved to Shenyang, and graduated from the Japanese Imperial University. In 1942, he became a traitor in Shanghai and served as a secret agent for the Shanghai Enemy Gendarmerie and a translator for the Mei Agency, plotting against many underground workers of the central government. The arrests of Jiang Bocheng and Yang Hu, who were betrayed, were also secretly reported by this traitor. Zhang was extremely promiscuous and frequented dance halls. It is unknown how many so-called red county women were raped by him. After the victory, he used the alias Mei Xin and hid in Nanjing. He then served as the deputy warehouse director of the Zhenjiang warehouse of the Logistics Department. He was arrested on May 25 last year while hosting a banquet at the Petit Paris Restaurant in the Confucius Temple in Nanjing. He was initially tried by the Military Law Department of the Logistics Department, but because Zhang's crime took place in Shanghai, he was transferred to the Municipal High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Recently, after investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, Zhang was charged with violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Item 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors and was prosecuted according to law.

### Single-Person Tricycles Obstruct Traffic; Rickshaws Temporarily Stop Being Converted

[Reported by this newspaper] Rickshaws in this city were previously ordered to be converted into single-person rear-seat tricycles. The first batch of vehicles to be eliminated has already been completed. The second phase of the elimination was suspended by the central government, so it has not yet been carried out. However, those who voluntarily apply for elimination and conversion are not subject to restrictions. Up to now, a total of more than 6,000 vehicles have been converted, and there are still some that are being converted. The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that the speed of these converted vehicles is faster than rickshaws and slower than cars. They run rampant and obstruct traffic more than rickshaws. It is planned to follow the explicit instructions of the Executive Yuan to temporarily suspend the elimination of rickshaws, as well as the recent requests from the rickshaw industry association, and to temporarily suspend the automatic elimination and conversion into single-person rear-seat tricycles. The above proposal was put forward by the Public Works Bureau for discussion at the traffic review meeting in the central district. After discussion, it was decided to temporarily retain it, and then submit it to the Municipal Affairs Conference for further study before submitting it to the Municipal Council for decision.

### Rice Store Owner Arrested for Selling Rationed Rice at Black Market Prices

The Sixth Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters received a tip-off yesterday that a local man, Cao Xilin, opened the Yuancheng Rice Store at No. 150 Xuejiabang Road in Nanshi. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau distributed 30 bags of rice to the store (each bag weighing 125 catties), but he did not sell it according to the rationed price. Instead, he secretly sold it all to a rice restaurant on Wujiang Road at black market prices. The brigade investigated and found this to be true, so yesterday afternoon at 6:00 p.m., they summoned the store owner Cao Xilin for strict questioning.

### Exhibition of the Late Chairman Lin's Relics - Subscription for Admission Tickets Extremely Enthusiastic

The late Chairman Lin was fond of calligraphy and painting throughout his life and was skilled in connoisseurship. His inherited calligraphy and paintings, from the Song and Yuan dynasties to modern times, number no less than a thousand pieces, all of which are treasures. Ancient works include Buddhist images by Li Longmian, "Washing the Elephant" by Yuan artists, landscapes by Gu Huating, Shen Shitian, Shi Tao, Wang Shiguy, and Gong Banqian, and calligraphy by Fang Xiaoru, Wen Huiming, Wang Duo, Chuan Qingzhu, and Zhang Ershui. Modern works include authentic calligraphy and paintings by Zeng Nongqiu and Qing Daoren, all of which are exceptionally famous and valuable. Currently, the chairman's family is selling these calligraphy and paintings in accordance with his will, to establish a fund for the Shanggan Linsen School. The exhibition will be held at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road from the 20th to the 25th. Those who wish to purchase can buy a calligraphy and painting ticket for 600,000 yuan and draw lots to obtain a piece. Yesterday was the first day, and those visiting and buying tickets were very enthusiastic.

### Enemy and Puppet "Treasures" - Difficult to Distinguish Genuine from Fake - Special Experts Appointed for Appraisal

The Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearing Office has received dozens of boxes of antiques, calligraphy, and paintings, some of which may be Japanese calligraphy and paintings, or porcelain and stoneware, not all of which are precious items. Expert appraisal is essential. To strengthen the handling of enemy and puppet industries, the office has recently appointed several experts to appraise authenticity and falsity before pricing and auctioning them off. Special fine items will reportedly be transferred to government-run museums for safekeeping.

### China Travel Service Issues Joint Transportation Tickets for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway

Since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway resumed operation after urgent repairs, passengers have praised its convenience. However, passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou to transfer to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway often find the stopover time in Hangzhou too short to purchase tickets for that railway, resulting in unnecessary delays. It is now learned that the China Travel Service in this city, for the convenience of travelers, has reached an agreement with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway authorities. Starting from the 20th of this month, the agency will issue joint transportation tickets from Shanghai to major stations along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, initially limited to Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, and Lanxi. After arriving in Hangzhou, passengers can board the reserved-seat train departing from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway at 1:30 PM, avoiding unnecessary delays and reserving seats in advance. This is truly good news for travelers.

### Director of the Taishan Sanatorium Accused of Abuse and Abandonment - Cohabiting with a Japanese Woman - Beating His Wife Causing Injury

[Reported by this newspaper] Lin Bohui, director of the Taishan Sanatorium on Linsen Middle Road, is accused of abusing his wife and abandoning his children due to his affair with a Japanese woman. His wife filed a claim with the District Procuratorate, including documentation of her injuries, and filed a lawsuit. According to the complaint: Lin Bohui, a native of Fuzhou, is 48 years old. He was raised by his uncle, a Japanese businessman named Lin Qingchun, and received Japanese education. He graduated from South Manchuria Medical College and worked as an internist at Fuzhou Bo'ai Hospital before the war. Later, he established Chengnan Hospital in Nantai, Fuzhou. His wife, Qi Guangyu, graduated from Fujian Normal School. They have been married for 23 years and have eight children. Before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Chen Yi, the chairman of Fujian Province, sent Lin to Kyushu Imperial University Medical School in Japan for advanced studies because Lin was proficient in Japanese. In 1940, Lin obtained a medical doctorate and returned to Shanghai with a Japanese nurse, Hirota Tokiko, opening a clinic in the Zhongxing Building on Fourth Road. He then began cohabiting with Hirota Tokiko in Hongkou. At that time, Fuzhou fell to the enemy, and Qi's mother and children fled to Shanghai. Lin completely ignored the livelihood of his wife and children, so his wife lived with her mother's family. Later, Lin, relying on the power of his mistress Hirota Tokiko's collusion with the enemy and puppet regime, acquired a building on Linsen Middle Road and opened the Taishan Sanatorium, serving as its director. He also rented a building from Hartong on Weihaiwei Road, renaming it Lin Village, as his residence. Through the intervention of Qi Guangyu's mother's family, Qi's mother and children also moved in to live together, but they were often beaten by Lin and his mistress. After the victory, Hirota Tokiko changed her name to Sotsu Ranyu and continued to hide in the Taishan Sanatorium. Recently, when Qi went to get living expenses, she was beaten and injured by Lin again. Qi, unable to bear the abuse, went to the District Procuratorate to document her injuries, where Prosecutor Yu Yixin summoned both parties for questioning and ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Central Government Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Inspect the Work Competition of Transportation Agencies

The Central Work Competition Promotion Committee was ordered to strengthen work competition in order to coordinate with the General Mobilization Act. The committee sent Xu Yanfei, director of the Transportation Business Department, to Shanghai yesterday to guide the competition among central transportation agencies in the city. Yesterday afternoon, he listened to a report from Deputy General Manager Shen at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It is understood that since the implementation of the competition system, the company has achieved remarkable results, with the wheel transport work competition led by Zhang Shouguan and the wharf cleaning competition organized by Shen Daowu being the most successful. Before the competition, the Shanghai-Hankou route took 15 days, and the Shanghai-Tianjin route took 10 days. After the competition, the Shanghai-Hankou route was reduced to 10 days, and the Shanghai-Tianjin route was reduced to 7 days. Nine wharves participated in the cleaning competition. In the first evaluation, Jinliyuan Wharf was rated as excellent, and in the second evaluation, Yangjiadu Wharf was rated as excellent, with certificates of merit issued by Director Xu. It is reported that Director Xu will inspect the Railway Administration and the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee starting next Monday.

### Wu Guozhen "Addendum" - A National Doctor on Hankou Road

[Reported by this newspaper] In addition to the fifteen Wu Guozhens found in the household registration cards in Shanghai, there is actually another Wu Guozhen who has been overlooked here. (See photo, taken by this newspaper)

On the wall in front of No. 331 Hankou Road hangs an enamel sign that reads: "Guoyi (National Doctor) Wu Jufang's Son, Guozhen Medical Clinic."

We met him in the clinic on the second floor, a 49-year-old man originally from Suzhou. He said that his family has resided in Shanghai for fifty years and has never moved.

Speaking of Hankou Road in his childhood, the situation was very desolate, completely different from today.

Finally, the reporter asked him, "Have you registered your name in the household registration?" He replied, "I registered it long ago." This is recorded here as an "addendum" for reference!

### Theft of Cloth at Dyeing and Weaving Factory - Two Workers Collude

[Reported by this newspaper] Liangxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Kaixuan Road in western Shanghai reported the theft of cloth some time ago. At midnight on the 17th, another seven and a half pieces were stolen. The next day, the factory reported it to the Changning Road Police Sub-bureau. Section Chief Xu Zhizhong ordered Inspector Zhao Xiruo, Police Chief Xu Shibiao, and others to rush to investigate. After inspecting the Standard Flour Mill next door, a large amount of stolen cloth was discovered. It was learned that Zhang Xiecheng, a worker in the factory, had purchased it. Zhang was taken into custody for questioning and confessed that the stolen cloth he purchased was stolen by Cao Taifang, a worker at the Liangxin Dyeing Factory, and then sold to him. Cao was arrested and confessed that all the previously stolen cloth was done by him. The investigation of this case has been completed, and it is scheduled to be sent to the District Procuratorate for prosecution this morning.

### Shanghai Briefs

Luo Zhaoxiu, director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's Shanghai office, returned to Shanghai yesterday. He said that the disaster situation in Guangdong Province is still very serious and hopes that fellow villagers will provide more relief.

Yu Bingjian, director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, and Li Tong, director of the Business Department, were summoned to Beijing last night to review telecommunications business.

The Sixth District Party Headquarters held a full district representative assembly yesterday morning and issued a declaration supporting the government's suppression of rebellion and national construction.

### Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education Entertained Reporters in This City Yesterday - Current Educational Issues - Returned to Beijing by Night Train That Evening - Will Still Come to Shanghai in the Near Future

[Reported by this newspaper] Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, entertained reporters from various newspapers at 5:00 PM yesterday at the Academia Sinica at 320 Qiqi Road in this city. Chen Dongyuan, supervisor of the Ministry of Education, attended with him. Vice Minister Hang reported on current educational issues during the event:

Basic Education Issues

(1) The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Far East Basic Education Research Conference is scheduled to be held in Nanjing from September 1st to 12th. The Ministry of Education has already convened a preparatory meeting for this purpose and invited eleven units including the Philippines, India, Vietnam, Burma, and Siam to participate. Japan is not included. After the conference, a tour will begin on the 13th, and they will come to Shanghai on the 15th for a stay of about three days. I have already contacted the Municipal Education Bureau to prepare for the tour, hoping that after mutual observation among the Far Eastern countries, basic education can be promoted and popularized. The meaning of basic education includes national education, mass education, and social education. In addition to literacy, people also need to have national consciousness, production skills, and common sense of science and hygiene. This is the same as the educational purpose stipulated in our country's constitution, which is to cultivate civic morality, national consciousness, sound physical fitness, scientific knowledge, and production skills. The so-called "poverty, disease, ignorance, and selfishness" are China's four major enemies. Now, production skills can eliminate poverty, sound physical fitness can eliminate disease, education and literacy can eliminate ignorance, and civic consciousness can eliminate selfishness. This is not only an educational issue but also a basic issue for national establishment. Therefore, basic education is a major task in the period of national construction. Now that the country is embarking on the road to democracy, we can advocate the slogan "Education for Democracy," which also includes the above-mentioned points. Therefore, basic education is the greatest need for education in China today. In addition to making the people literate in the simplest way, we also use the latest scientific methods such as educational films and educational broadcasts to promote and popularize it.

School Equipment Issues

(2) How can Chinese education make progress after the restoration? The most important thing is still the equipment of books, instruments, and stationery. For example, magazines can be used for scientific research, and European and American countries have complete sets. Our country, due to the relationship of the Anti-Japanese War, has lost some or is not provided by foreign countries, resulting in incompleteness and difficulty in understanding the process stage. The Ministry of Education previously negotiated with the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and United Nations agencies for an allocation of 4 million US dollars due to the government's lack of foreign exchange for the purchase of books, instruments, and stationery. Later, when 3.2 million US dollars were used, the government used the remaining funds to purchase cotton. To date, of the books, instruments, and stationery ordered, more than 900 boxes of engineering equipment have been shipped to Shanghai and stored at Jiaotong University. The Ministry of Education has specially organized a distribution committee to be responsible for inspection and distribution work. In the future, all colleges of engineering in the recovered areas of the country can have a set of equipment. Other ordered agricultural and medical equipment are also available and will be distributed to various schools in order after they arrive within the year. The Ministry of Education will continue to apply to the government for funds and find other ways to obtain foreign exchange in order to continue ordering national harmful instruments and stationery from abroad to enrich the equipment of various schools.

School Building Issues

(3) The number of professors and students in various schools has increased several times compared to before the war, and the original school buildings are not enough. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly requested additional funding for the necessary construction of national schools. The government, due to limited funding, has raised funds as much as possible, and recently decided to allocate 65 billion yuan. I have conducted a survey of various schools during this trip to Shanghai, and a portion of the construction costs will also be allocated in the future. After Vice Minister Hang finished his report, reporters from various newspapers asked questions, and Vice Minister Hang answered them one by one as follows:

Study Abroad Examination Issues

(1) Regarding the issue of studying abroad, there are now two different views in the country. One believes that the country needs talents and should first expand domestic educational institutions, which can also reduce the outflow of foreign exchange. The other believes that the domestic level is not enough and a large number of students should be sent abroad. The current practice of the Ministry of Education is a compromise, that is, sending students abroad in consideration of the actual situation. Our country's study abroad system started in 1872 and has a history of more than 70 years. In the beginning, there was no overall plan, so the results were not ideal. I personally believe that national construction requires talents, and studying abroad is indeed necessary. Therefore, we have been helping those who have the opportunity to go abroad as much as possible last year and this year. However, due to the limited financial resources of the country, the more than 1,000 people who passed the self-funded study abroad examination last year required 4 million US dollars in foreign exchange. Therefore, although the Ministry of Education feels the need for talents, there are indeed difficulties in reality. This summer, there are no plans to hold a self-funded study abroad examination. Although the list of those who passed the translator study abroad examination has been announced, they are still in the process of contacting schools, and it may not be possible to go abroad within the year.

Professor Dismissal Issues

(2) Regarding the dismissal of professors from some national universities in Shanghai, to my knowledge, the Ministry of Education has never authorized it. The Ministry of Education has appointed the president as the person in charge of a school and should absolutely trust the president, including the issue of appointing professors. The Ministry of Education does not need to send the list of professors hired by various schools for review, nor has it provided a list to various schools to authorize dismissal. The Ministry of Education trusts the president, and the president has the right to decide whether to reappoint professors after the annual assessment. Currently, universities in the United Kingdom decide on the appointment of professors through committees established within the school. Tsinghua University in China also has this organization. I personally believe that Chinese education needs scientific progress and academic freedom. Both professors and students need to understand that citizens of democratic countries have their rights and obligations. Although everyone may have different views on certain matters, they can have constructive suggestions for the school they serve, but not destructive actions. Students are the masters of the country in the future, and their actions, no matter what, cannot go beyond the law. Academic freedom means that political ideologies within the school can be different, but there is no need for actions such as strikes. For example, the famous universities of Cambridge and Oxford in the United Kingdom, everyone can have different political opinions, but it has never been heard of a strike for a certain number of days. Now that the General Mobilization Order has been issued in the country, anyone who violates the action of any party will be dealt with by law.

Arrested Student Issues

(3) I did not come to Shanghai for the issue of arrested students. However, I have been contacting various parties in the party and government organs as much as possible, hoping that those with minor offenses can be released on bail as soon as possible. (4) Xian Yu, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, has resigned and has been persuaded to stay. Some university presidents have resigned, perhaps because the situation within the school is complicated and difficult to handle. The Ministry of Education is currently discussing this.

[Another report] Vice Minister Hang invited those in charge of relevant colleges and universities last night to discuss the issue of reappointing professors for the next semester and returned to Beijing by night train that evening. According to Vice Minister Hang's statement to reporters: he will still come to Shanghai in the near future.

### Incumbent Elementary School Teachers Granted Postponement of Military Service

### Kang Province Promotes Women's Normal Education - The Situation Is Special, and the Source of Female Students Is Not Easy - Strictly Abide by the Central Instructions and Gradually Develop

[Special report from Kangding by this newspaper] The Xikang Education Department recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Education stating that the promotion of women's normal education has been circulated to various provinces and cities for implementation. Now, during the implementation of the five-year normal education plan for various provinces and cities after the war, various provinces and cities should actively promote it in accordance with the original order in order to complete it and ordered to obey and report. It is understood that the original order shows: (1) Each province and city should reach the principle of establishing one male and one female normal school in each designated normal school district. If two normal schools have been established in each district, a women's normal school department should be added to each school to promote women's normal education. (2) Each province should consider the local conditions of each county and promote the establishment of women's normal schools in appropriate counties in each province, and add women's simple normal classes in counties where simple normal schools have been established to accommodate female students who have graduated from elementary schools. If the simple normal schools in each province are suitable for co-educational teaching, they should still be handled in accordance with the old plan and do not need to be changed. (3) Starting from the 35th academic year, each province should increase the number of independent women's normal schools and recruit outstanding female students who have graduated from junior high school or elementary school. (4) The original independent women's normal schools or women's simple normal schools should increase the number of classes as much as possible. (5) The principal of a women's normal school should be female in principle. A review of the province's women's normal education has long been in strict compliance with the instructions of the Ministry of Education and the Central Government, paying attention to promotion. According to the actual situation in this province, the first step is to co-educate in the existing normal schools and simple normal schools, expand the number of female students as much as possible, and gradually increase the number of women's normal classes and simple normal classes, and then independently establish women's normal schools and simple normal schools, in order to gradually promote them. However, due to the special situation in this province, women's education at all levels is still in its infancy. It is difficult to recruit female students for the establishment of women's normal classes and simple normal classes. It is even more difficult to obtain student sources for the independent establishment of women's normal schools and simple normal schools. In the autumn of the 34th year, the plan to reorganize the provincial Kangding Normal School into a women's normal school was included in the province's plan to adjust normal education and was approved by the Ministry of Education. However, the first class of female students recruited was insufficient, and the source of female students would be even more scarce in the future, and the Ministry of Education was requested to postpone the establishment of the women's normal school. In this situation, the promotion of women's normal education in this province in the future is still planned to be handled in accordance with the aforementioned principle of gradual expansion and incorporated into the province's third normal education plan as a key implementation point. It is reported that the Education Department has reported this situation to the Ministry of Education for review.

### Election of Academicians of the Academia Sinica - Nomination Period Extended by One Month

Universities, colleges, specialized academic societies, or research institutions have been nominating candidates for academicians in an endless stream. The nomination period was originally scheduled to end on July 20th, but because the works of the nominees during the Anti-Japanese War were often lost and took time to collect, several universities and academic institutions requested an extension. In order to take into account the actual difficulties, the Academia Sinica has extended the nomination deadline to August 20th.

### Ministry-Compiled Elementary School Wall Charts - Hunan Province Requests Open Factory Rights

[Changsha Aerial News] The Hunan Provincial National Education Association believes that since the copyright of the nationally designated textbooks has been made public, the wall charts that match the textbooks should also be freely printed by the workshops. These wall charts were previously compiled and drawn by the Ministry of Education and sold by the Xin Ya Bookstore, including various types such as children's health charts, daily routine charts, and social etiquette charts. The price was very high, and there were no distribution networks in various places, so general schools could not buy them. Therefore, it was specially submitted to the Ministry of Education to make the copyright public, so as to avoid monopoly and relieve the book shortage. At the same time, local reproduction and printing were carried out, which was very beautiful. The selling price of each set was only three-tenths of the original price, which was very popular among the schools.

### Outstanding Elementary and Secondary School Teachers Must Not Be Dismissed Without Reason - The Ministry of Education Telegraphed Various Provinces and Cities for Notification

[China News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] According to news from the Ministry of Education, the autumn semester is approaching, and many elementary and secondary school teachers in various places have been engaged in education for more than ten years, focusing on the great development of students' academic studies. They not only do not compete for personal fame and gain, but also adhere to their posts in the current extremely difficult life of teachers. Such personnel should be supported in today's deteriorating social atmosphere in our country, and the school authorities must guarantee their minimum livelihood of clean poverty and self-preservation. However, it has been found that in general private schools, the employment of teachers is completely based on the private friendship of the principal or certain vested interests. That is, a part of the teachers who have already been hired, whether they are re-hired or not, is not determined by their teaching performance, so that those who have dedicated themselves to education for life are worried about their lives in the next semester. This situation is not only common in private schools, but also in some public schools. Moreover, in today's society, there are too many people everywhere. Among them, a part of people with no experience are simply filling the ranks due to the principal's personal relationship, while a group of teachers who have made sufficient contributions to the education circle are dismissed without reason, which has a profound impact on the education cause. In addition to issuing a telegram to all national secondary schools that they must not dismiss teachers without reason and that employment letters should be issued two months before the start of the semester, it has also issued a special telegram to the education departments of various provinces and cities to be effectively responsible for the management of teacher employment and to forward it to the principals of public and private elementary and secondary schools in each county for notification.

### Over a Hundred Jiaotong University Professors Sign Letter to Retain President Wu Baofeng; Hang Liwu Reportedly to Preside Over the Reorganization of Jiaotong University Affairs

[Our Newspaper's Report] President Wu Baofeng of National Jiaotong University has repeatedly submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Education. Over a hundred university professors, including Qiu Weiyu, Zhou Ming, Chen Shiying, Zhong Weicheng, Kang Shiqing, Li Taiyun, and Zhong Zhaolin, signed a letter to retain President Wu, citing his significant contributions and efforts to the university's affairs over the years. The original letter is as follows: "To President Wu Baofeng: We have recently heard of your intention to retire and that you have repeatedly submitted your resignation to the Ministry of Education. We are extremely surprised by this news. We recall that since Shanghai fell into enemy hands, our university's history was almost at its end. Fortunately, you managed to painstakingly operate in the rear, establishing a branch school and expanding it into a full university. The number of students even doubled compared to the past. After the victory of the War of Resistance, our university's restoration was the fastest in the country, and the buildings and equipment of the Shanghai campus were preserved. For the past year, you have diligently maintained the university amidst extreme financial difficulties and strived to reorganize it, which has deeply inspired all faculty and students. In recent months, student movements have surged across the country, and our university has also been caught in the vortex. Fortunately, your steady leadership has gradually quelled the situation. You have endured hardships for many years. Now that the university has restored order, it would be a wise move for you to retire for your own sake. However, for the sake of the university's future, at a time when all university affairs need to be actively promoted and reorganized, we need your leadership and continued efforts. We feel lost and disoriented at the sudden loss of your leadership. We urge you to prioritize the university and dismiss your intention to resign. We, your colleagues, would be extremely fortunate, and the university would be extremely fortunate. We respectfully wish you well."

[Shenzhou News Agency Report] According to news from Jiaotong University, President Wu Baofeng is determined to resign and has stopped coming to the university to work. University affairs require immediate attention. The Ministry of Education has specially dispatched Vice Minister Hang Liwu to Shanghai to preside over the reorganization of the university's affairs and to form a reorganization committee, with Hang serving as the chairman.

Zha Liangzhao Talks Upon Arriving in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zha Liangzhao, President of National Kunming Normal College, flew from Kunming to Beijing at the beginning of the month to attend the Far East Basic Education Preparatory Conference and the Education Problems Symposium. He has now completed his official duties and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. He is currently residing at the home of his younger brother, President Zha Liangju. Zha told reporters yesterday that Kunming Normal College was established last summer. Because many famous professors from Southwest Associated University stayed to teach, the college was able to inherit the excellent traditions of Southwest Associated University. The students' level is also quite ideal. The college's progress has been greatly aided by the full cooperation of local people. After its establishment, the college implemented a "trimester system" to take advantage of Kunming's spring-like climate throughout the year. However, the Ministry of Education believes that this matter is related to the school system and requires further study. Therefore, the college will still adopt a "semester system" this year. The trial implementation of the trimester system may have to be restored next year. It is reported that Zha will stay for a few more days and will fly back to Kunming from Shanghai this Thursday (the 24th).

### Wide Disparity Between Domestic and Foreign Prices Threatens Tung Oil Production and Sales

American Countries are Actively Increasing the Production of Linseed Oil

The United States and South American countries are actively improving the cultivation of tung trees and the processing and manufacturing of linseed oil to replace tung oil. It is generally believed that this will pose a great threat to the sales of tung oil in our country.

According to tung oil dealers, our country's tung oil is currently unable to be exported. The domestic price has risen to over 600,000 yuan per ton, while the foreign price is only over 200,000 yuan per ton, a huge difference, making it impossible to trade. The Central Trust Bureau has now announced that it will purchase at a market price of 620,000 yuan, but this is not a long-term solution. The United States and South America are the countries with the highest production of linseed oil in the world. In the past, South America sold as many as 120,000 tons of linseed oil in ten transactions, which shows the abundance of its production.

However, linseed oil is inferior to tung oil in the manufacture of paint. To manufacture fine paint, tung oil is still needed. Our country is the country with the highest production of tung oil. It is not impossible to increase the production of tung oil in our country, but no one plans to increase production, and its output is decreasing year by year. Before the war, more than 100,000 tons could be exported every year, but after the war, only more than 28,000 tons were exported last year, earning 27 million US dollars in foreign exchange, which is very different from before the war.

This year's exports have increased slightly. From January to April, 30,000 tons have been exported. With the Central Trust Bureau's purchase, some can still be exported, but it still cannot catch up with the pre-war level. Therefore, to strengthen production and sales and compete for the foreign market, the government must appoint a special commissioner to plan the overall strategy, otherwise the future of tung oil production and sales is unlikely to be optimistic.

### Black Market Exchange Rate Has Decreased Significantly, Capital Flight Gradually Returns

Recently, due to the situation in the north, there has been a large-scale flight of capital in the country. Huge amounts of capital from the Northeast and Tianjin have been concentrated in Shanghai, and then smuggled to Hong Kong via Guangzhou and Xiamen. At the same time, a large amount of cash has been smuggled to South China, causing a great shortage of financial resources in North China, and a cash panic has occurred in this city. The exchange rate from Shanghai to Guangzhou and Xiamen has been raised by state-owned banks to a maximum of 95 yuan per thousand yuan. Commercial banks are as high as 150 yuan, and the black market exchange rate is even more alarming, once reaching 360 yuan.

According to information from the Central Bank, since the domestic situation has stabilized, the flight of capital has stopped, and there are signs of returning along the original route. Therefore, the amount of remittances to Guangdong has decreased sharply in recent days, and the black market exchange rate has also decreased significantly. It is currently almost the same as the exchange rate of state-owned banks, and remittances to Tianjin have increased instead.

Also, it is reported that cash premiums have occurred in Guangzhou's oilfields and other places in South China. At its peak, 100 million yuan in cash could be exchanged for as much as 134 million yuan. Therefore, merchants in this city are carrying huge amounts of cash out of the country in various ways to make profits. Therefore, the financial authorities have strictly restricted remittances from this city to Guangdong and Fujian provinces.

However, merchants are profiting from cash arbitrage, and to avoid the authorities' attention, they have changed their routes. One route is from Shanghai to Hankou and then to Hengyang, and the other route is from Shanghai to Kunming and then to Wuzhou, and then concentrated in Guangzhou for operation.

It is reported that the authorities have stipulated that the exchange between Shanghai and Hankou shall not exceed 50 million yuan per week in order to further restrict this special transaction. If there is a legitimate use and the amount exceeds this figure, application procedures must be completed for review and approval.

### Silk Reeling Loan Approved by the Four Banks Joint Office

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] According to a responsible person from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the loan for cocoon purchasing this spring has been completed. A total of about 200,000 dan of fresh cocoons have been collected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and northern Anhui. The Silk Guidance Committee believes that raw silk is urgently needed for reeling at present. After submitting to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and sending a letter to the Four Banks Joint Office, it is estimated that about 14,000 dan of raw silk can be made from 200,000 cocoons. It is calculated that about 6 million yuan is required for the reeling labor cost for each cocoon of raw silk, and a loan of 84 billion yuan is requested, which has recently been approved by the Four Banks Joint Office.

### Taiwan Sugar's Promotion in Southeast Asia Achieves Great Success

[Central News Agency, this city] In order to cooperate with the national policy and encourage exports to earn foreign exchange, the Resources Committee ordered its affiliated agency, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, to select high-quality cane sugar for export to foreign countries for promotion. After consultation, 200 metric tons of special grade granulated sugar were shipped on the Taikoo Yangxing Fuzhou wheel on the 17th of last month, with 100 tons each to Java and Singapore for trial sales. The selling price was US$500 per metric ton, or US$0.22 per pound, which was a complete success. It is learned that Singapore has re-ordered 100 metric tons, which the company has entrusted to the original wheel to be shipped directly to the area from Keelung on the 19th of this month. It is reported that sugar is needed everywhere in Southeast Asia. When Taiwan sugar was transported for the first time, it was welcomed for its quality, packaging and weight, and it was considered to be the same as the best products produced in Java before the war. Moreover, the area suffered heavily from the war, and the sugarcane fields and factories were severely damaged. They had not yet recovered. Taiwan sugar was considered to be a rare commodity in the past five years. In order to maintain the international market, Taiwan Sugar Corporation takes the export of fine products as a principle. Products such as cotton and white are all rejected. In order to encourage promotion, exporters who are interested in operating are also welcome, and they plan to sell a large amount of new products after they are launched at the end of the year.

### Central Trust Bureau Purchases Old Tea, Tea Merchants Ask to Raise the Purchase Price

Planning to Send Four Representatives to Petition in the Capital

Regarding the purchase of 70,000 boxes of old tea last year by the Central Trust Bureau, the bureau had previously approved the purchase price for Qimen tea as 720,000 yuan per dan. However, the tea merchants asked the responsible authorities to raise the purchase price without success. They have submitted documents to the Executive Yuan and other relevant ministries and courts a few days ago, listing the difficulties and requesting a review.

The tea merchants requested an increase of 50% based on the price approved by the Central Trust Bureau, because the tea market has been prosperous recently, and the prices of all grades of tea have risen by 20-30%. Therefore, the actual price difference between the two parties is about 30%. The China Tea Export Industry will hold a general meeting at the beginning of the week and plans to send four representatives to petition in the capital.

### Beijing-Shanghai and Longhai Railways Allocate Cars to Transport Northwest Cotton

In order to solve the cotton shortage in this city, China Textile Corporation has recently decided to purchase a large amount of cotton from the cotton-producing areas in the northwest to meet the urgent needs. The company has obtained the approval of the Ministry of Transportation to order the Beijing-Shanghai and Longhai Railways to allocate 500 tons of freight cars for the exclusive use of transporting cotton. The special train set off from Shanghai to the northwest a few days ago. According to the person in charge of China Textile Corporation, the first batch of northwest cotton will arrive in this city in half a month. After that, the special train can travel back and forth twice a month, and 1,000 tons of cotton can be supplied to the textile industry in this city every month.

### Assisting Transportation, Public Utilities and Other Enterprises, Traffic Bank's Work Situation, A Large Number of Loans Were Issued in the 35th Year

[Our Newspaper News] According to regulations, the main professional business of the Bank of Communications is to assist in the recovery and expansion of transportation, public utilities, and industrial and mining production. The details of the bank's handling of this professional business in the 35th year are described below:

Assisting Transportation Enterprises

In the past, during the Anti-Japanese War, the transportation situation in the rear was relatively backward, and the objects of assistance were also relatively few. After the victory, major railways and shipping lines in the recovered areas, as well as air transport, were actively restored. The bank did its best to provide loans. As for railways, there are Jinpu, Pinghan, Yuehan, Longhai, Xiangguizhou, Beining, and Zhongchang roads. Almost all of the main lines in the country are included, and the total amount of loans for the whole year reached tens of billions of yuan. In terms of highways, in addition to assisting the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation in repairing various roads, private long-distance bus companies purchased vehicles and restored passenger and freight transportation on various roads, which was also the goal of the bank's efforts. The total amount of loans for the whole year also reached more than 10 billion yuan. In terms of ships, such as assisting shipping companies to purchase ships, salvage sunken ships, and temporarily lending shipping companies working capital to promote the rapid recovery of the shipping industry, the total amount reached more than 14 billion yuan. There are not many objects in the aviation industry, and the loans are relatively small, with the 1.1 billion yuan of the Central Airlines being a large number.

Assisting Public Utilities

Regarding public utilities, the most important in our country's current situation is the power industry. Power is the mother of all industries and the foundation of people's livelihood. Over the past year, loans have been given to working capital and assistance in expanding the purchase of machinery and other items, including the electricity industry in major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Hankou, Nanchang, Jinan, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Lanxi, Wenzhou, Wuchang, Zhenjiang, Bengbu, Wuhu, Yichang, and Chengdu, totaling more than 7 billion yuan. In addition, more than 2 billion yuan was loaned to assist the water supply business in Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Chengdu and other places in purchasing machinery and materials. In addition, the bank assisted in the purchase of automobiles and machinery for urban transportation, sewage docks, ferries, etc., with a total amount of more than 9 billion yuan.

Supporting Industrial and Mining Production

The support for industrial and mining production is mainly focused on four items directly related to the people's livelihood: the textile and dyeing industry, the food industry, the chemical industry, and the mining industry. The textile and dyeing industry includes cotton, silk, and wool. The food industry is mainly the flour industry. The chemical industry is mainly the basic chemical industry and the chemical products industry. The mining industry is mainly the coal mining industry. In particular, the textile and dyeing industry has a longer history and scale in my country's current industry, so the loan figures are also larger, totaling more than 70 billion yuan. In order to adapt to the social and economic situation and consider the urgency of needs, the loan figures are the largest for the cotton spinning industry, followed by the silk weaving industry, and then the wool weaving industry. All large and small cities in the country, from yarn factories with tens of thousands of spindles to handicrafts related to the people's livelihood, have been assisted as much as possible if they meet the loan conditions.

At the same time, various aspects have been given to support silk cocoons and silk weaving. The bank participated in or mainly handled spring cocoon loans in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to assist in cocoon collection, support cocoon farmers, increase production, and loan to the Shanghai silk weaving industry, the Hangzhou silk weaving industry, and the silk business. In terms of the food industry, the total amount of loans reached more than 20 billion yuan, mostly for the flour industry. In addition to collateralizing raw materials and finished products, during the wheat season, advances were used to assist in purchasing raw materials in the production area, in order to ensure that the funds were actually used for purchasing materials and producing. The chemical industry is next, with a total amount of more than 10 billion yuan. Because the chemical industry is not yet popular in my country's industrial sector, in addition to providing as much assistance as possible to larger chemical industries, general small factories and other chemical daily necessities manufacturers are also supported.

In other industrial fields, such as cement, oil refining, leather making, rubber, auto parts, and building materials, loans were also provided. As for mining loans, they reached more than 20 billion yuan. The coal-producing areas in the country, such as Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces, as well as larger coal mines, such as Zhongxing, Kailuan, Huainan, Henan Minsheng, and Sichuan Tianfu, have dealings. In the northeastern region, lending operations to assist in reconstruction and promote production forces are also being gradually carried out. In summary, the total outstanding amount of loans to transportation, industry, mining, and public utilities throughout the year, as of the end of the year, totaled more than 150.9 billion yuan, accounting for 72% of the total amount of loans, which shows that the bank has spared no effort in supporting transportation, public utilities, and industrial and mining production, and has also barely met its professional mission.

As for other businesses, they are (1) assisting in smoothing the flow of materials; (2) handling special businesses assigned by the government; (3) smoothing domestic and foreign exchange business; (4) managing foreign exchange on behalf of the government; (5) adjusting branch institutions; (6) savings business; (7) promoting trust business

Assisting in Smoothing the Flow of Materials

This year, in order to cooperate with the government's policy of smoothing the flow of materials and stabilizing prices, the bank actively promoted domestic inter-port collateral business in accordance with the collateral principles set by the Four Banks Joint Office, and provided as much import and export collateral as possible for manufacturers who purchased local products from various places for import and sold local products for export. Those who need to finance funds during the packaging period are also given appropriate assistance. During the cotton production season this year, in order to assist various manufacturers in purchasing cotton in the producing areas, cotton purchase collateral business was also handled. As for exporters who need financial accommodation to search for materials in the mainland and transport them abroad, they will be given assistance in accordance with the regulations for export materials that have been exchanged at the bank. As of the end of this year, more than 120 billion yuan has been processed for inter-port collateral business, more than 20 billion yuan for cotton purchase collateral business, and more than 30 billion yuan for export of foreign materials. However, because domestic transportation is not smooth, the results are still not satisfactory, and it still needs the joint efforts of all parties.

Government-Assigned Business

At the beginning of the victory, prices in the rear areas plummeted, which led to the inability of the industry to maintain its costs, and work was suspended one after another. The government urgently sought relief and designated the bank to cooperate with China, Zhongnong, and Zhongxin banks and other banks to handle emergency industrial loans in the rear areas. This year, the bank continued to handle cases from the previous year for factories that have not yet received this loan, and the rear industry relied on it to barely overcome difficulties. As of the end of the previous year, the bank had undertaken more than 1.1 billion yuan, and this year it has loaned out more than 52 million yuan successively. At the same time, it also undertook reconstruction loans in the recovered areas to assist in the resumption of business of industry and mining in the recovered areas. The bank has loaned a total of more than 5.9 billion yuan. In addition, in order to assist overseas Chinese in resuming business, the Ministry of Finance formulated measures for overseas Chinese to resume business loans, which were handled by the bank and the China Development Bank. The funds were shared by the Central China and the bank. The loan area is divided into five areas. The bank undertook the Philippine and Myanmar regions, and the Philippine region was entrusted by the bank to the Philippine Bank of Communications, which is currently negotiating with the local consulate. The Myanmar region has been handled by the bank's Yangon branch. Overseas Chinese who applied for loans were very enthusiastic, and about 2 million shields have been released.

Smoothing Domestic and Foreign Exchange

Since the victory, branches in the recovered areas have actively resumed business, and the exchange business has expanded day by day. Regarding domestic exchange, at the beginning of the restoration, the funds in the recovered areas relied on the allocation from the rear areas, but at that time, transportation was not smooth and the transportation of vouchers was difficult. The bank concentrated the adjustment and concentration of exchange funds in important places where industry and commerce were prosperous and funds were solved, and set up an exchange fund to plan for its smoothness. On the one hand, import and export collateral are used to mutually regulate. In July of this year, the national bank was to stabilize prices in Shanghai and manage exchange applications in various places. The bank cooperated in the implementation and strictly limited the acceptance of exchange applications by various places. The number of accepted exchanges was allocated based on the legitimate needs of industry and commerce, so that the intention of smoothness was still included in the restriction.

In summary, the total amount of exchange business of various banks and offices throughout the year has increased by more than 1.4 trillion yuan compared with the victory before. As for overseas remittances, the bank formulated measures to restore overseas remittances at the beginning of the victory. In India. The bank's original institutions continued to receive remittances. In the Philippines, after the US military recovered it, it was entrusted to the Philippine Bank of Communications, and the institutions in Vietnam and Myanmar were also restored successively.

In summary, the bulk of overseas remittances received are remitted to Fujian and Guangdong. On the one hand, institutions have been added in areas where overseas relatives are concentrated, and on the other hand, the procedures for receiving and resolving remittances have been simplified as much as possible. After the foreign exchange market was opened in March of this year and the US dollar exchange rate was raised, overseas remittances increased significantly. However, later, due to the exchange rate, overseas remittances gradually declined. Although the US dollar exchange rate was raised again in August, the number of remittances received still showed little improvement.

The total amount of overseas remittances received throughout the year, combined with national currency, was 4.55 billion yuan, including 3.87 billion yuan in the Philippines and 670 million yuan in India and Myanmar.

Handling Foreign Exchange Management on Behalf of the Government

In March of this year, the government announced measures for foreign exchange and import and export trade management, authorizing the Central Bank to temporarily manage foreign exchange tasks, and stipulating that designated banks may operate foreign exchange. The bank is one of the designated banks, and the foreign exchange management center is in Shanghai, so the Shanghai branch first operated foreign exchange transactions in accordance with the foreign exchange management measures. Later, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shantou, Jiangmen, Wuzhou, Qingdao and other places successively undertook it. In addition to purchasing foreign exchange, all sales of foreign exchange are limited to uses that comply with regulations. Regarding foreign currency deposits, they were legally stopped when the foreign exchange management measures were implemented. As of September 30, the foreign currency deposits that had been made in various banks and offices had been converted into national currency according to the balance, and the bank sold them to the Central Bank in British and American gold separately. In November, the provisional measures for import and export trade were revised, and import permits must be applied for before import. Except for the application for goods in categories 1, 3 and 2 in Annexes 1, 3 and 2 in Shanghai, which are priced at less than US$2,000, which can be handled by designated banks. All other import applications must be approved by the Import Association. At the same time, the registration of importers was processed and the foreign exchange business was settled, which was temporarily stagnant. As for export exchange settlement, due to the imbalance between the exchange rate and the domestic and foreign cost prices, although there were some undertakings, the number was not large (to be continued)

### Zhangzhou Litchi Sees New

The first batch of new dried litchi from Zhangzhou arrived in small quantities yesterday. Because the cost is relatively high, actual sales are hesitant and prices may not be very good.

### This Year's Yarn and Cloth Production Can Reach 2 Million Pieces

Estimated that 1 Million Pieces of Cotton Yarn Can Be Exported

The authorities will use the total amount of yarn and cloth produced by state-owned and private yarn factories across the country last year to supply domestic needs, and export the increased quantity this year.

According to an expert from the textile industry, if the news is true, the amount of cotton yarn available for export this year will increase significantly. According to the production of cotton yarn in various branches last year, state-owned enterprises produced about 460,000 pieces, and private factories produced about 600,000 pieces. The total production was no more than 1 million pieces.

It is estimated that state-owned factories can produce about 800,000 pieces this year, and private factories can produce about 1.2 million pieces. The total production is estimated to reach about 2 million pieces, then the cotton yarn for export is estimated to be about 1 million pieces.

### Timber Market Conditions

It is heard that a large number of fir trees are shipped from Fujian to Shanghai. The market atmosphere has changed from firm to flat, and there are occasional forward sales. The market atmosphere of foreign pine is weak.

### Caustic Soda Source is Scarce, Affecting Soap Factory Production, The Industry is Eagerly Awaiting Active Assistance from the Government

The important raw material caustic soda required by my country's soap industry has always been purchased from countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, especially from the United States, and the supply of domestic caustic soda only accounts for a small part.

Since the Import Control Committee restricted the amount of foreign exchange, the source of foreign goods has been greatly reduced, and the raw materials for the soap-making industry are increasingly depleted, affecting production. The relevant authorities have tried their best to give the industry priority in the supply of caustic soda, but it is still a drop in the bucket and difficult to solve the problem. According to the current production situation of the 40 factories in the industry, at least 700,000 kilograms of caustic soda are required per month.

It is learned that in the first half of the 36th year, the caustic soda raw materials allocated to the industry included 50 barrels of Yongli caustic soda (300 kilograms per barrel) allocated by Yongli Chemical Factory in March, at a price of 4.8 million yuan per barrel. In April, 300 bags of Yongli soda ash (80 kilograms per bag) were allocated, at a price of 150,000 yuan per bag. In May, 50 barrels of Yongli caustic soda were allocated, at 6.4 million yuan per barrel, and 400 bags of Yongli soda ash were allocated, at 400,000 yuan per bag. In June, 97 barrels of Taiwan Lighthouse brand caustic soda were allocated by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, at 5.6 million yuan per barrel. The above-mentioned allocated raw materials were allocated to all members by the industry association according to the production ratio. However, because the sales price at that time was not lower than the market price, some members voluntarily gave up. The larger factories, in order to take into account the future allocation rights, bought all of them.

According to people in the industry, the allocation situation like this does not provide active assistance to the industry. Soap is a necessity for people's daily life and one of the important industries. Therefore, they are eagerly awaiting strong assistance from the government and various competent authorities, so that the future of my country's soap industry can be developed.

### Shanghai's Plywood Industry

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office on the general situation of the plywood industry in Shanghai, the details are as follows:

I. Overview: There are seven plywood factories in the city, namely Xiangtai, Yicheng, Fenghuang, Jingyi, Shanghai, Qiming, and Yangzi. Xiangtai and Yicheng were established in 1927 and 1928 respectively. (At that time, Xiangtai was run by the British-owned China Timber Import and Export Company). This marked the beginning of the plywood manufacturing industry in Shanghai. In the first two or three years, the products were only used for packing tea for export from China, so the equipment at that time was relatively small. Later, due to the development of the business and the expansion of the use of plywood, the furniture and construction industries adopted it, so the equipment was expanded to produce large 3x6 or larger plywood sheets. And factories such as Fenghuang, Jingyi, Shanghai, Qiming and Yangzi were established one after another. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, the factories were forced by the environment to suspend operations one after another. Only the Qiming and Yangzi factories run by the Japanese continued to manufacture. After the victory, the factories actively resumed production, and now all seven factories are in operation.

II. Equipment: The factory sites of each factory are located where there is water access to the Huangpu River for the convenience of transporting the main raw material, round timber. The main equipment includes peeling machines, cutting machines, drying machines, gluing machines, cold pressing machines, hot pressing machines, drying rooms, horizontal and vertical edge cutting machines, planing machines, and sanding machines. Among the seven companies, Xiangtai has the most complete equipment, suitable layout, and larger output. The existing equipment of each factory cannot be fully utilized due to the lack of raw materials. The number of machines and the number of machines in use in each of the seven factories are listed as follows: Planing machines: 7 units, 6 units; Sanding machines: 1 unit, 1 unit.

III. Products: Various plywood, such as three-ply, five-ply, and seven-ply, but the output of 3x6 three-ply is the largest, because it is the most needed in the market.

IV. Output: In terms of output, according to the equipment matching situation of each factory, the maximum output and the current output are listed as follows (calculated based on 3x6 three-plywood):

V. Raw Materials: The main raw materials for manufacturing plywood are Lauan wood, casein powder, caustic soda, soda ash, and goods bean powder.

VI. Conclusion: At present, the domestic plywood industry has occupied an important position in the construction, furniture, and decoration industries. The current monthly output is about 100,000 sheets, which is not enough to meet the needs of the market. In order to increase production, the raw materials needed by the industry, such as Lauan wood, casein powder, and caustic soda, in terms of domestic products (although Lauan can be replaced by domestic pine, the output is not enough) cannot be supplied in large quantities. In the past, in order to maintain the production of the industry, temporary import was unavoidable.

It is found that wood is the most important raw material in plywood manufacturing, accounting for four-fifths of the total price of raw materials. The domestic production of local timber should be planned as soon as possible so that it can be fully supplied by itself and no longer rely on foreign sources. It is urgently needed to improve logging machinery and equipment, transportation, so as to increase output, and cultivate forests to ensure a permanent and continuous supply.

### Affected by Soaring Prices, Summer Woolens Rise Steadily

After mid-summer, worsted woolens woven from fine wool have seen their retail and wholesale prices rise due to the issuance of fire banknotes and the impact of soaring prices. Woolen merchants are following the lead of the manufacturers, and are competing to purchase during periods of rising market prices. Actual sales of melton have largely fallen behind, but its price has also risen considerably, demonstrating the abundance of floating capital in Shanghai. In terms of actual sales, both Chinese and Western clothing fabrics are strong, with high-end woolens from afar selling more actively than lower-end goods.

Mid-summer woolen prices continue to rise. People in the industry predict that the market will inevitably rise further, mainly because orders are difficult to place and manufacturers' production costs are high and gradually decreasing. Relying solely on Hong Kong re-exports and smuggled goods being shipped to Shanghai is like a drop in the bucket, and will not solve the problem. At the same time, the price of rice has exceeded 400,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and the prices of various goods have risen in a straight line, which is also a major reason.

Woolens continue to rise in price steadily in late summer, becoming even more intense after mid-month. Except for summer goods such as poplin and valeting, which are slightly weaker due to seasonal sales, most goods have risen across the board. This is mainly because transportation and public utilities have soared first, and various goods have followed suit. Rice prices have risen to 500,000 yuan, and the prices of various commodities such as silk yarn, silk cloth, cigarettes, soap, and vegetables have jumped one after another. Woolens cannot be an exception. And the high cost of shipping from Hong Kong and falling cargo prices are also a reason. The cost of making Western suits has been affected by the de-freezing of the cost of living index, and the cost of making each suit has risen across the board, with prices of 1.2 million to 2 million yuan being quoted. Zhanghua flannel is currently sold at 350,000 to 360,000 yuan per yard in the market, while the manufacturer's fixed price is 400,000 yuan, with 70% of the purchase price required in foreign currency.

The standard market prices of woolens for the three months of early, mid, and late summer are listed below for reference: The following are all wholesale prices per yard, in yuan.

### Wei Daoming's Inspection Tour - Accompanying Notes

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Mu Yun

Taipei, 17th Airmail

Traversing 500 Kilometers of Western Taiwan

From July 12th to 17th, this reporter accompanied Chairman Wei, Director Zhu Foding, Chief of Staff Niu Xianming, and others on an inspection tour, traveling 500 kilometers through eleven large and small counties and cities in western Taiwan.

Taiwan Island is currently in its hottest season. After crossing the Tropic of Cancer in Chiayi, one cannot wipe away the beads of perspiration. The scenery along the weaving routes is familiar to this reporter. We breathe in the aroma of freshly tilled soil after the first rice crop has been harvested. Old farmers wearing bamboo hats drive water buffalo to plow the fields. The lychee orchards are quiet and peaceful. Mangoes and longans can be picked along the way... The fields truly complement the misty mountains and the low, red farmhouses. Taiwan is as lovely as Jiangnan, and as worthy of love as the Southern Country!

When Chairman Wei and his party were on the recovered land of the motherland, experiencing the prosperous region under their management and interacting with honest and progressive people, they must have felt an unusual excitement in their hearts!

Shadows, Smallpox, Bacteria

Deep shadows of the February 28th Incident still remain. These shadows are truly unfortunate wounds. The Taiwanese people have not forgotten the disasters they brought. They now have only one hope: lenient treatment and a quick resolution! This is under a major premise: the principal offenders must be brought to justice, and the accomplices and suspects must be released as soon as possible!

Chairman Wei said optimistically that this was just a misunderstanding, and misunderstandings can be resolved through understanding. Because he firmly believes that the Taiwanese are genuine Chinese, sharing the same Chinese blood, customs, and habits. People from both inside and outside the province are compatriots. He cited the situation in the Sichuan and Chongqing areas in the early days of the War of Resistance to illustrate that emotional breakdowns only lead to greater affection. In the past year and a half, the Taiwanese people have made great progress in learning Mandarin. They can speak in Mandarin, and some can even give short speeches. Chairman Wei also hopes to be able to express his political views in Taiwanese a year from now, breaking through the language barrier.

After all, the February 28th Incident was a painful event. Even now, the true inside story has not been revealed. The staff at all levels are still not energetic, as if they have lost their elasticity. Some people mistakenly believe that it was a "May Fourth Movement" on the island, or even a "revolutionary movement." But regardless, it is the best lesson for the new provincial government. It uses blood, tears, and the anger of life to indicate the road signs of governance. It is hoped that this shadow can disappear immediately and the wounds can be healed quickly. Some people say that February 28th may be smallpox, but it cannot become bacteria. In Kaohsiung and Fengshan, this reporter saw elderly men with white hair wearing long gowns and vests. Fifty years of foreign subjugation could not eliminate the image of ancient China, only strengthen their patriotic centripetal force. The Taiwanese compatriots will never deny that they are 10/10 Chinese!

Visiting Lin Xiantang in Wufeng, Taichung

Wherever Chairman Wei went, he was the object of visits and interviews by the public, senators, subordinates, and mountain compatriots, as well as to catch a glimpse of his appearance. The exception was a visit to Provincial Government Committee Member Lin Xiantang, which took place on the morning of the 13th at the Lin residence in Wufeng.

The Lin residence is a palace-style courtyard with red and green colors depicting the old era. It has the same atmosphere as the Lin Benyuan Garden in Banqiao: quaint and charming. Mr. Lin has white hair and a bald head, but is full of energy. He is an elder who owns over 150 jia (one jia equals fifteen mu) and has three generations living under one roof. He is a representative of the landlord class.

During the February 28th Incident, Lin Xiantang acted as a protector for Yan Jiagan, the director of the Department of Finance. Not only did he not participate in the incident, but he also directly helped the people from other provinces. His firm performance was successful when Minister Bai arrived in Taiwan! In fact, he is an authority among the 6.3 million people, a gentleman in a leading position. He can and must sacrifice the small self to complete the larger self. However, in the recent debate over the purchase of surplus grain at government-set prices, he stood solely on the interests of the landlords, rejecting the theories and actual figures of the Food Bureau, and insisted on raising prices. As a result, he was ultimately defeated by the opposition of the majority of the people, and the price of 27.5 yuan per kilogram was passed. Mr. Lin was utterly defeated!

Wufeng has had a glorious history. Liang Qichao once visited it, and Duan Qirui's inscription still hangs in the hall, making people feel like they have entered a noble family in Suzhou. As we left this small town, we were pondering this question: "If Taiwan Province were to implement popular elections, would the provincial chairman be Lin Xiantang?"

Re-Dividing Administrative Regions Sparks Disputes

At the Provincial Government meeting, Lin Xiantang made a suggestion to revise the local administrative regions. The main points are: (1) Reduce the size of the counties to simplify and facilitate official communication; (2) Make popular elections easier; (3) Eliminate district offices. That is, change the current eight counties and nine cities in the province into twenty-two counties! This is just a suggestion, and the provincial government needs to consider this administrative reorganization, which is too extensive, in the long term. However, this suggestion alone has caused a great reaction. The majority of people unanimously argue that the unreasonable small county system has long been abolished in advanced countries and can no longer be applied today. However, because the restoration time was too short, the authorities failed to deliberate on it in the long term, resulting in some unreasonable phenomena. Even if corrections are made immediately, it will not be easy!

Senator Hong Yuanhuang of Hecheng said: The re-division of administrative regions and the determination of county and city locations cannot be determined solely by personal subjectivity. He said passionately: Why does Taichung City, which has a superior environment, not have a county seat, but allow the government of 1.2 million people to be forced to Yuanlin, which is remote, low-lying, and lacks facilities, so that civil servants run back and forth every day? And the original buildings are abandoned?

More Than a Month of Torrential Rain Causes Disaster

Taiwan is a disaster-prone area. Typhoons, rain, earthquakes, rapids, and sandy soil cause the greatest damage to construction. More than a month of heavy rain has caused disasters in the south. The steel frame of the 46-meter-long Dadu River Bridge, which was washed away, is still being sucked by the muddy stream. The edge of the Wu River still has a broken mouth. Taichung County has suffered the worst flood in 20 years. More than 40 embankment breaches have occurred, farmland has been turned into ruins, and the people are shouting for relief and repairs. The emergency repair cost for the disaster in the Da'an and Dajia rivers, which was jointly undertaken by the government and the people, is 2 million yuan, and the project cost requires 12 million yuan. However, complete restoration and repair require 1.1 billion yuan, which is a huge figure.

Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other places have also suffered great disasters. Although this situation is not as bad as the Yellow River breach, in such situations the Taiwanese people often use this to test whether the government cares about the people's suffering.

Seventy percent of Taiwan's farmland relies on man-made water conservancy projects, with the Chianan Irrigation Canal being a representative work. Chairman Wei praised the construction of this canal. However, the Japanese built water conservancy projects and supplied farmers with increased production, but returned the profits to the Japanese. Today's government is helping with construction as much as possible and distributing the profits to the public. Construction is difficult, but maintenance and protection are even more difficult. The annual cost of water management for the entire province is 200 million to 3 billion yuan. Construction and emergency repairs in Taiwan need to proceed simultaneously.

Enthusiasm for Local Construction

The Taiwanese people's enthusiasm for local construction is unmatched by the people in the interior. They are only afraid of not having the opportunity, and when they have the opportunity, they will never give up their right to speak, never forget their locality, and never abandon their own interests. Most of Hsinchu County is dependent on rain-fed agriculture, and they particularly hope for water conservancy construction. Hsinchu City, with 75,000 citizens, because Zhudong has a large amount of natural resources, longs for the rapid development of an industrial city. Taichung City needs to complete Anping Fishing Port in addition to the construction of a cultural city; Chiayi City is clamoring to complete a "land port."

In counties with abundant agricultural products, they all hope that the factories that the Allies demand as compensation can be relocated to their respective regions. They are even more urgently demanding fertilizer factories, demanding low-interest loans for reconstruction, demanding the allocation of cement and wood to genuine needs, and demanding improvement of farmers' lives.

Especially in Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, the gunpowder of war still leaves a strong smell on the ruins, and it is still the dilapidated scene of the early days of restoration. In the current situation, it seems that it only allows people to recall the visions of the past and the future, and only makes such dreamy and enthusiastic reveries!

One Direction, One Route

The Taiwanese people have more economic demands than political demands. The provincial government is now adopting this approach: stabilize the economy and stabilize society. After stabilizing the economy, then seek to stabilize society. The value of the Taiwan dollar has increased, and the prices of some special products have decreased or increased. After the economy is stable and prices are not volatile, then seek improvement and construction! This is a direction for progress, a route.

Chairman Wei, in a relaxed and sharp tone, warned the provincial people not to be superstitious about Japan and not to ignore reality. He said: "In the past world, the past China, and the past Taiwan, if we had taken over, the lives of the compatriots would certainly be better than at that time; if the present world, this China, and this Taiwan were still occupied by the Japanese, the lives of the compatriots would be even more painful and without freedom. Precisely because we are facing this extremely difficult situation, we must not close our doors and ignore the world's situation."

In economic policy, the new provincial government seems to have chosen a limited form of liberalism. The principle is that the government should establish, cooperate, and support the people in need, and the people need to demonstrate their strength, which is democracy!

Welcome Entrepreneurs to Invest

Chairman Wei believes that the Taiwan issue is both simple and optimistic!

Taiwan has a foundation in education, construction, agriculture, and industry. This foundation has been damaged by the war, and has not yet been restored. Chairman Wei promised the people of all counties and cities to quickly repair the national schools and find ways to relieve unemployment. Through his efforts to delve into the people in the heat, he has gained a clear outline of the issues surrounding the majority of Taiwanese compatriots. This is an excellent basis and reference for governance, and the distance between the past government and the people has been shortened!

Taiwan has a relatively stable environment, more advantageous and lower-cost power and labor than the interior, and some special products and raw materials to supply the needs of industry, flexible transportation tools, and ports. The provincial government uses both hands to reject all speculators, while smilingly welcomes large-scale enterprise investment!

Taiwan has already had a new starting point. This new starting point will use the power of democratic spontaneity to practically crush all the rumors and delusions of aggressors and ambitious people!

Currently, the Taiwanese compatriots are more rational, but they still urgently need to be warm and full, need to establish a good and normal social atmosphere, and need close cooperation in all aspects to solve the pressing problems they want to solve. They place their hopes on the new provincial government, which has been established for two months! (Photo by Mu Yun) (Photo by Mu Yun) (Photo by Mu Yun)

### Liu Bocheng on the Longhai Line: The Already Muddy Water of the Turbid Yellow River; The Already Suffering People of Bitter Western Shandong

— Our Reporter Fan Shiqin

Zhengzhou, 13th (Airmail)

It is said that the Yellow River is a natural defense line spanning the entire country, dividing the north and south. The south is even stronger than the north because there is also the Longhai Line parallel to the river, which can be considered the second line of defense of the Yellow River. This point has already been proven by facts in the history of the War of Resistance, so there is no need to discuss it further. What I want to say now is why, from Tongguan downstream, both the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Longhai Railway are as tense as the bulging veins of an angry person. This tense situation is caused less by the imminent Yellow River flood and more by the rebellion and treachery instigated by bandits like Liu Bocheng.

Miscellaneous Troops Ordered to Advance

After Liu Bocheng's failed attack on Anyang, he immediately replenished his forces, saying he would continue to attack Anyang, but secretly planning something else. Coincidentally, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) called for both sides to cease military operations in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. So, he crossed the south bank of the Yellow River in the Puyang area, captured Youcheng, occupied Yuncheng, attacked Heze, assaulted Dingtao, and fled to Juye, not only muddying the already muddy waters of the Yellow River but also causing suffering to the already suffering people of western Shandong. Naturally, the eastern section of the Longhai Railway entered a state of tension. Northern Henan is an area disturbed by the Liu bandit. This time, after he attacked western Shandong, his miscellaneous troops naturally followed his lead, also fearing that they might be eliminated after their leader left, so they continued to harass everywhere. Liu Bocheng certainly knew that they were not very effective, so he relied on some Taihang Mountain bandits, such as the "New Independent 4th Brigade" and the "Independent 5th Brigade," to support him, asking them to create a disturbance in northern Henan to distract the enemy. Approximately 20,000 bandits from the Taihang Mountains infiltrated the Bo'ai, Qinyang, and Mengxian areas, causing the water of the Yellow River in this section to stir up invisibly and become artificially turbulent.

It is said that four brigades of Chen Geng's communist troops on both sides of the Tong-Xiao Railway have moved to Jinyang. It is also said that they want to set up a long, riverfront snake formation from west of Mengxian to Yuanqu, also wanting to stir the Yellow River water into ink black to facilitate their muddying the waters.

Therefore, from the border of Henan and Shaanxi along the river to the border of Henan and Shandong, both the great river and the railway are tense with bulging veins.

Attempt to Establish a New Base Area

Careless people, or those who only listen with their ears, think the communists are truly remarkable. But if one looks at Chen Yi's defeat in Shandong, where he almost had to slip to Yantai to cross the river, then Liu Bocheng's attack in western Shandong and Chen Geng's support are nothing more than desperate measures. Liu Bocheng is especially clear! Chen Yi's defeat today is Liu Bocheng's destruction tomorrow. Of course, Chen Geng is just as clear as Liu Bocheng: Liu Bocheng's destruction tomorrow is Chen Geng's demise the day after. Why is this so? When the Jinpu Railway is open, Chen Yi is finished; when the Pinghan Railway is open, Liu Bocheng is finished; when the Tongpu Railway is open, Chen Geng is also finished. Therefore, they have to pull the vertical battle line that threatens their lives onto a horizontal battle line that can save their lives.

According to Liu Bocheng's recent propaganda, he plans to go to the Dabie Mountains in the border area of Henan and Hubei to establish a base area, and Chen Geng also plans to cross the river and go to the Qinling Mountains in the border area of Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, and Sichuan to establish a base area. It is fine for Liu Bocheng to just boast like this, just as his past claim to capture Anyang in three weeks was a joke. But if they really want to do this, what will they gain besides being a scapegoat for Li Xiannian? This statement can be annotated as follows: this statement fools people, like a tiger borrowing the power of a human; this statement is an input, inputting people to see through its reality.

Clever Tactics: Setting Up the Han Xin Formation

This time, Liu Bocheng no longer attacked Anyang but changed to attacking western Shandong, not daring to confront the enemy head-on, which shows his cleverness. Because the tricks he played in Anyang were all exposed by the defending troops of Li Banqing. Some of the National Revolutionary Army in western Shandong have not yet fought against him, which can show off his skills on the one hand and prevent his troops from losing morale on the other. Whether successful or not, he is setting up the famous Han Xin formation. The only difference is that Han Xin's backwater formation did not have boats prepared at the crossing, while Liu Bocheng's backwater formation has both soldiers and boats at the crossing. Liu Bocheng's backwater formation has its strengths and weaknesses, and we must come to this conclusion. Liu Bocheng also benefits from fighting in western Shandong because the communist troops of Jin Shaoshan and Wei Fenglou in the flood area can directly support him. It is said that they have already been partially concentrated south of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, with a generous estimate of about 10,000 men. Jin Shaoshan and Wei Fenglou have been able to operate in the flood area because they have always relied on scattered groups of three to five hundred or one to two thousand men to cause chaos. This time, their concentration can certainly support Liu Bocheng, but this concentration also gives the National Revolutionary Army the opportunity to annihilate them! Jin Shaoshan and Wei Fenglou's difficulties are the last thing Liu Bocheng can understand right now, and he will have to wait for the facts to tell him.

Decisive Battle Launched; Supply Difficult

When writing this dispatch, the National Revolutionary Army may already be engaged in a decisive battle with Liu Bocheng's concentrated force of 50,000 to 60,000 men between Heze, Yuncheng, and Dingtao. The result of this decisive battle will be left blank for now. This is not because there is no confidence in the judgment or because it concerns any military secrets, because the matter is too clear. If he attacks in that area this time, does he want to be drowned by the Yellow River flood in victory, or does he want to escape back to his old disturbed area of northern Henan in defeat? Running ahead of the Yellow River water, I have already explained it for him earlier. To put it more clearly, one only needs to ask where his supplies are.

Chen Geng's Troops Only Provide Support

If the communist troops in the Mengxian area, or even Chen Geng's troops, want to cross the river to cause trouble, then crossing the river with a small force will surely lead to annihilation. Crossing the river with a large force requires a large investment, but what guarantee do they have? When Li Xiannian's remnants asked Chen Geng to come and meet them, they never succeeded. Liu Bocheng has been going in and out of the area of western Shandong and is familiar with the roads, but how easy is it for Chen Geng to cross the river for the first time and come to the area of western Henan? The two or three hundred remnants in the Funiu Mountains are no match for the power of Jin Shaoshan and Wei Fenglou in the flood area to support him. Even waving flags and shouting is too far away. To sum it up in one sentence, Chen Geng's troops are only capable of providing support and cannot form a main battle situation. If they can make the water of the Yellow River in this area look even more turbulent and rapid, then they can be considered to have accomplished their mission.

Naturally, there will be a tense situation on this line for a considerable period of time. (Photo by this newspaper)

### "Restoration" No. 1 Rice Seed

— Our Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

Taiwan, 18th (Airmail)

The Chiayi Agricultural Experiment Branch has a well-deserved reputation for its research and improvement of agriculture in Taiwan. The branch realized that Japonica rice (called Penglai rice in Taiwan) was greatly harmed by rice blast disease. For decades, scholars from various countries had been immersed in research, but without results. After many experiments, they finally selected the K11001 strain from the Japonica rice hybrid system, which was confirmed to have significant resistance and good yield and quality. Its yield is more than four times higher than that of the Tainan 65, the most common standard variety currently grown in Taiwan. This unprecedented achievement is truly a new era in the rice breeding industry and a glorious contribution to agriculture in our country. When Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming inspected Chiayi on the 14th of this month, he specially named it the "Restoration" No. 1 rice seed, which is particularly meaningful.

### Executive Yuan Announces the National Highway Network Plan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 18th] The Executive Yuan recently announced four measures for the National Highway Network Plan and a table of route mileage for the National Highway Network Plan. The National Highway Network Plan aims to consolidate national defense and develop the national economy. All highways that connect the capital with provincial capitals, important ports, and international passages, and that have transportation value that is widespread throughout the country or spans several provinces, should be designated as national highways and managed by the central government. The four key points of the National Highway Network Plan are as follows: (1) National Highway Routes: National highway network routes are identified by names such as "Base" and "Meridian," and are marked separately. In addition to the national highway routes in the nine northeastern provinces, Taiwan province, and Hainan Island, which will be announced separately, the following are the four Base lines, five Meridian lines, six Latitude lines, and twenty-two Meridian and Latitude connecting lines, for a total of thirty-seven lines and a total length of 57,223 kilometers (see the National Highway Network Route Table for details).

(2) National Highway Management: In the initial stage of taking over national highways, the road sections listed in the approved table, totaling 38,608 kilometers in length (see the National Highway Takeover Route Table for details), will be taken over by the central government. The Highway Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation will be responsible for construction, maintenance, improvement, and transportation administration, and will also handle supervision and other matters in accordance with the Highway Supervision Implementation Regulations. The remaining road sections will be temporarily managed by the provinces.

(3) Traffic Management: Traffic management of all highways in the country will be unified in accordance with the various regulations approved and promulgated by the Ministry of Transportation. For national highways taken over by the central government, the collection of road maintenance fees and matters related to traffic safety will be handled by the Highway Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation.

(4) National Highway Takeover Measures: Some of the national highway routes listed in the appendix to the second item, which were originally managed by the China Planning Bureau, such as the highways in the southwest, northwest, and Sichuan-Kang areas, will continue to be managed by the China Planning Bureau. For the remaining roads originally managed by the provinces, the Ministry of Transportation will negotiate with the provincial governments to formulate measures for gradual takeover. National Highway Network Plan Route Mileage Table (Note: The national highway routes for the nine northeastern provinces, Taiwan province, and Hainan Island will be announced separately.)

Spring and Autumn

### Living in an Upstairs Apartment

— Feng Tinghe

People accustomed to living in upstairs apartments have a natural pleasure, just like people accustomed to living in the countryside. This pleasure has a "difficult to explain to outsiders" quality, and only those accustomed to living in upstairs apartments can truly appreciate it. If you are an upstairs apartment dweller and you happen to live in a ground-level house for a day or two, when you close your eyes and meditate, if you recall living in an upstairs apartment, you will truly have a feeling of floating between heaven and earth.

I love living in upstairs apartments. When the moon is beautiful and the flowers are blooming, I lean against the railing of the upstairs apartment and listen to the chirping of insects and birds. Cooking smoke twines around my sleeves, and the clouds give my face a flying kiss. Then I think of the writer Wang Can, who was moved by the scenery and wrote a poem. Although his emotions were delicate and beautiful, almost like the feelings of a young girl, it is certain that the fact that he climbed the stairs caused him to have such a pure and poetic inspiration and write a poem.

People who have lived in Beiping for a long time often like to talk about the unique sounds of the city of Beiping. However, only those who live in upstairs apartments can understand the art of these sounds. I lived in Beiping for a long time, and I spent most of those long years living in upstairs apartments. My perception of the sounds of the city of Beiping went through three stages of evolution. At first, I was annoyed and thought they were the whistles of the city, emitting many different tones and giving the citizens a variety of calls. A little later, I found these sounds pleasing to the ear. A certain sound could express a certain meaning. Later, after I got used to hearing these sounds when I lived in an upstairs apartment, I felt very familiar with them, like many musical notes playing a complex and changing nocturne of the ancient city every night. The apartment I lived in was on a quiet street in a bustling area. Pushing open the window and leaning on the railing, I could clearly see those who were making the sounds. Then I began to marvel at the greatness of this ancient city, and I also savored the elegant interest of living in an upstairs apartment.

My trip to Wuhan was an unforgettable memory in my life. Among these memories, I should describe my feelings about climbing the Yellow Crane Tower. Speaking of the Yellow Crane Tower, this historically famous scenic spot is the most politically significant tower in ancient and modern times. When I climbed the tower, I was filled with emotion and stirred up the ancient thoughts that had been hidden in my heart for many years, imagining how the heroes of the past used nature to expand their strategies. The Yellow Crane Tower is in an excellent location, giving those who climb it a profound impression of grandeur and magnificence. When I climbed the tower and leaned against the railing, I felt like I was about to fly away with the wind.

I also remember an old-fashioned winding corridor-style tower in the home of a relative in my hometown. Their ancestors left them such an interesting tower. The floor space was very large, and the construction was ingenious, connecting front and back, left and right. The wide areas were like large courtyards, and the extended areas were like corridors. That kind of environment was unique. It was also situated next to mountains and water, with lush flowers and trees, which added to the spectacular nature of the tower. I spent a summer there. At that time, I was organizing poetry, and my mind was filled with beautiful and lingering moods and words. Combined with the poetic environment around me, it tasted like chewing olives.

Many people like to talk about the scenery on the lake. I also want to talk about it here. My hometown is Poyang Lake, one of the five great lakes. My home is a waterside village on the lake, with winding embankments and graceful willow branches. My home is a layered building in the style of a waterside pavilion. Looking out the window, I can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the lake. Because it is close to the water, when the lake floods, the lake water is close to the top of the tower where I live. So I can fish from the top of the tower, catching various kinds of fish easily. Sometimes the fishhook would pull on the willow branches along the edge of the tower, startling the orioles, which would fly away to the distance.

Living in an upstairs apartment on the lake naturally makes one accustomed to many aspects of life on the water and intoxicated with the mood of the water. Relatives and friends often release boats into the lake, pick baskets full of water chestnuts, and send them to the top of the tower, giving you a hearty and fresh meal. The most lingering thing is sitting on the top of the tower at night, listening to the boat girl singing amorous songs on the water, which adds a lot of romantic meaning to the life of living in an upstairs apartment on the water.

During the war, I also spent a period of time teaching in a mountain village. The school building was borrowed from a temple, and I happened to live in an upstairs apartment near the temple. The mountain temple was quiet and secluded, the forests were silent, the fog embraced the cliffs, and the waterfalls were sealed off. The quiet life of the monks gave people a feeling of being outside the world. Occasionally, I would talk with the monks on the top of the tower, listening to their stories of ghosts and foxes, and their preaching of Buddhist scriptures. It was both strange and novel, as if I was in the world described in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Among the many interesting aspects of living in upstairs apartments, living in an upstairs apartment in a mountain temple is also worth describing, filled with simple and elegant interest.

### The Use of Auxiliary Words in Rhyme

— Zhu Wen

Wang Changling's "Fishing Pond Poem": "Opening the door, I gaze at the long river; at twilight, I see a fisherman. May I ask the white-haired old man, how many years have you been fishing?" Meng Haoran's poem: "The place where I live is the most secluded, those who live there are all quiet. Relying on this mountain gate, who can imitate me?" Both rhymes use auxiliary words, which are elegant and refined. Chu Chaoyang's poem "Ode to Five Silks": "Deep beneath the water, it rests; in the middle of the day, it is congratulated." Gao Bi's poem "Serving the True Lord": "Its brilliance shines brightly; the heavens are in this place!" Han Shaoshi's poem "Special State": "Employment or dismissal depends on the time; poverty or success depends on fate"—this is an example of using auxiliary words in regulated verse.

### Night Reading

— Li Yitiao

When I was young, I happened to read an ancient-style poem called "The Joy of Reading," and I was quite moved by the lines "The reader's joy is boundless, in the quiet of the night, the windows of homes are still, a full moon shines on the frost-covered sky." This vividly describes the scene of reading on an autumn night. Although I didn't have much experience of reading at night at the time, I already felt that only in this way could it be considered a beautiful state for reading.

My school life in the ten years before and after the war was mechanical and chaotic. Although I had to study under the lamp and work diligently every evening during self-study, I never experienced the beauty of reading at night because of the noise and distractions. In the autumn of the thirty-second year [of the Republic], my schooling came to an end, and I started working in a small town in Huaibei. Our office was on the quietest street in the town, and I lived in the most secluded small building. The building faced the street on one side, but the other side was a small square courtyard. Although the two flower beds in the courtyard were half-ruined, the pomegranate and other flowers and plants were still lush and verdant. As soon as I saw this environment, I felt that it was very suitable for reading. After a few days, life had generally settled down. There wasn't much to do during the day, and of course there was plenty of leisure time at night. The small building was quiet and dust-free, and the books on the shelves had already begun to beckon to me. A few days later, it happened to be a moonlit night. Under the clear light, I leaned on the railing and gazed leisurely. The shadows of the flowers in the courtyard were on the wall, sparse and picturesque. The empty street outside the building was cold and silent, and the barking of dogs could be heard from time to time. At this time, my excited heart gradually calmed down due to the quiet environment. I began to open my bookcase, picked out a copy of "Sword South Poetry Collection," and recited it aloud under the moonlight. In a relaxed mood, I suddenly felt that this wonderful night was all mine, and the moonlight and flower shadows were all set for me. From then on, I began to experience the true joy of reading at night.

After that, I never forgot to read whenever there was a good night. However, I mostly read poetry collections or essays from the Song and Ming dynasties. Because I felt that only these things were suitable for the current environment; if I were to open up the classics and histories, I would feel out of place. Gradually, I also felt that reading alone was not enough to reward this wonderful night, so when the mood struck me, I would spread out paper by the window and write some essays or miscellaneous thoughts. The things that came out of this environment sometimes had no lack of inspiration. I kept writing and kept sending them out. From autumn to winter, I had dozens of articles published in total. Thinking about how diligent I was at writing back then, even I am surprised now.

In the winter of the year before last, I rushed home to finish my wedding. My wife was my classmate when I was young. We had been separated and scattered during the turmoil, and hadn't seen each other for ten years. A week after the wedding, I left my hometown again and went west. Since then, because my work had increased dramatically, I not only had no time to write articles, but I also gradually felt that I didn't have that peace of mind even for reading at night. Only when I went home each time, after everyone was asleep at night, would I often read with my wife by the light of a lamp. A cool moon filled the courtyard outside the window, flower shadows floated, all sounds were silent, and the sound of chanting could be faintly heard. This scene was as poetic and picturesque.

After returning north, I was increasingly involved in worldly affairs, and my mind became more and more restless. Sometimes, writing two short articles was already stealing leisure time from my busy schedule. The joy of reading at night had long since disappeared. Reflecting on the past in the quiet of the night, I couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.

### Rural Sketches

— Xu Minghuai

Sunset

The wings of the evening breeze begin to gently caress the still heart.

The sunset is a boat with sails full of crimson red cloth, stranded on the mountainside, struggling laboriously, panting娇喘, shyly... like the moment after a young girl bathes. Her rosy cheeks, which can be broken with a blow, cast a final enchanting smile, a weary smile.

The sunset is beautiful. A charming slender hand gently strokes the back of a thin, yellow cow. A shepherd boy whistles a light, clear whistle. The wisps of sound ripple into the evening breeze. A few shoulders of firewood are carried, slowly crossing the small bridge in front of the village, the lush hazelnut forest, and the crows fall rustlingly in the twilight. Vague and misty, it creates a serene and tranquil scene worthy of Van Gogh's brush, a mood that is sad and distant, an atmosphere that is refreshing and sorrowful...

The sunset is a beautiful little poem.

The poetry of the sunset is painted on the pale blue dome of the sky, sprinkled on the pale blue surface of the lake, like a lyric poem written on the poet's pale blue heart, oh. Xia Duoboli wrote in "Remembrance":

Do you remember the tranquil lake surface,

Touched by the light, agile swallows,

The swaying reeds are worried by the wind,

And the sunset on the water, so beautiful.

Reading it, I miss my friends in the distance. Reading it, I get sick, I get a melancholy sickness. Reading it, I feel the sigh of life, the loneliness of life, the eternal loneliness, the eternal sigh...

Night

The hazy dark clouds quietly fall, sadly and somberly kissing the wilderness.

The night sleeps, like a feverish corpse. The wilderness, emptiness, and unhindered spread; at the end of the earth, someone is lonely telling the story of the night:

In the jujube forest, at dusk, who has left behind a crisp and tender soul? A petite life struggles in rags. A wild dog approaches, revealing a gluttonous gentlemanly sneer, arguing fiercely, barking madly, tearing apart the dark fate, is it rejoicing, is it a praise?

A more mournful sound drifts into the night mist.

Cries permeate the low building, the amorous widow after dreaming, drowsily, trembling whispering, containing tears, silent sighing, silent sobbing, is it love, is it regret, is it hate.

The wooden fish rings out an enduring melody, accompanied by the nun's pious, gentle murmur.

The oil lamp bursts out joyous sparks, illuminating the unfaded youth: flushed face, rosy lips, fair skin, full curves with a rose-like smile.

A few large black shadows jump down from the wall, all flashing green, lewd, greedy eyes, thick black hairy hands tear apart the strong blue cloth pants, bestiality explodes like a bomb, continues to explode.

The black shadows disappear on the wall, leaving behind wave-like, satisfied, base laughter, a weak, painful groan, the oil lamp gazes in disappointment at the performance and finale of this tragedy.

Phosphorus fire, the eyes of ghosts, blink seductively with a dismal green light, the skull beckons from a pitch-black tomb, someone, hanging their head, dragging a cane, walks through the weeds. The dim eyes are low, so leisurely, serene, as if going to a grand banquet.

The birch trees rustle all around, the shadows of the trees press on the black keyboard, a dirge begins to play in the cemetery.

The thin neck falls on the belt tied to the elm branch, the feet leave the ground. He smiles, having found final comfort. "Death is the brother of sleep?" Yes.

You hear, someone is telling the story of the night to the earth, at its end, lonely, ceaselessly; the night is dark, like a feverish corpse. The dark clouds are even heavier, sadly and somberly kissing the wilderness——

### Summer · In a Mountain Village

— Chen Mao

Hillside

The hillside lazily continues, under the summer sunset.

The grass, lush and tall, thick and dense, stubbornly grows. The creeping kudzu entangles them, climbs over their heads, and climbs up a small chestnut tree.

A cicada sings loudly on the small chestnut tree, and another cicada echoes in the distant trees: "Zhi——la——"

The clouds move leisurely and slowly under the sky.

All around is quiet, quiet; even the sheep quietly graze, and a child can fall asleep in the shade of a tree.

Stream

The stream flows in the shade of the trees, the water is so green that it seems black.

A small fish slips out from under the roots of a tree, playing happily, but, upon seeing the sunlight sneaking in through the leaves, it splashes and slips back in surprise.

Upstream, a mountain village girl squats quietly and intently on the stone steps, she is serving a crab.

Further upstream, children are splashing water and making a fuss, the sound of laughter echoing the sound of women washing clothes with mallets downstream, and a cautious shrimp suddenly shrinks into a crack in the rock.

In the nearby mountain village, a hen is slightly telling that she has laid another egg.

Thatch Shop

In the lonely mountains and fields, a thatch shop is more precious to travelers and laborers than a palace.

The thatch shop leans against the ancient mountain road, at the foot of a hill or ridge, lonely stopping.

There is a shed in front of the thatch shop; a village woman sits in the shed, doing some work for her child. In the shed there is a tea jar, a table, and plenty of shade.

Strong and rough laborers, lonely and melancholy travelers; in the shed, they become friends, lamenting life together, comforting each other's experiences.... In places where people are scarce, affection becomes natural, sincere and frank.

In the evening, the cool and quiet shed becomes the paradise of the lonely children in the thatch shop. They will climb on the table and stare at the mountain mists and ridges with lonely hearts, humming some mountain songs.

And on the thatched roof, wisps of smoke rise.

When the sun wearily sets into the mountains and the distant ancient temple rings the leisurely evening bell, the twilight, it honestly covers the mountains and fields, ......

Then, the evening star, it appears on the treetops...

### Presented to Painter Ning Fu

— Ya Zi

Young and talented, your brush has rules,
Have you inherited the mantle of the tiger's madness?
Beautiful women and fine horses are your lifelong intent,
I beg you to paint a night hunting scene of Liaodong.

I rejoice that your hometown is Ciqi,
I too am a descendant of old hopes.
Remember when you took back the capital and went down to Wu and Yue,
We leaned on bamboo sticks together in the spring rain of Yongjiang.

### Inscription on Ling Xu's Painting of Ling Bo Fairy

— Shi Shufan

Barefoot on the wild waves, treading without dust,
I thought to imitate the startled swan, not necessarily mad;
But the trace of dissolving form is still preserved,
Your teacher is also a person in the painting.

How many times have I pondered the pure offerings at dusk,
Living in the mountains, poor and unable to sell incense;
I want to pluck plum blossoms, the bright moon advises,
The spiritual energy of the empty hall flies freely.

### Presented on Ji Kang's Painting Exhibition

— Xu Shiqi

I envy your elegance that transcends the mundane,
You are skilled in writing famous names, wonderfully entering the divine;
Heavy makeup or light makeup are all natural,
They compete to spread the word that the beauty of the country belongs to this person.

### Ladies

— Ji Kang

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 351

— Ye Jingfeng

Speaking of Yaoqun, her only secret is "enduring fatigue." As long as there is something to do, she can endure it, enduring for fifty or sixty hours without blinking an eye. Her philosophy is also very special: she says, "When we do things, we should have the spirit of an old gambling addict playing mahjong; even if it's three days and three nights, we should become more energetic the more we play." This type of person relies entirely on concentrating their spirit to maintain their interest in the task; interest can drive away the sleep demon. Fortunately, she is a healthy young woman, with no distractions, knowing only "national affairs first" and "work first." Unlike ordinary social ladies, who focus on "luxury above all else" and "love above all else."

The little tiger's sleep problem has no amazing performance: 1. Because he is greedy, he wants to sleep as soon as his stomach is full; 2. A child who is only twelve or thirteen years old is in the middle of development, and naturally needs to sleep. Of course, he has martial arts skills and can endure fatigue, but it is entirely out of coercion. We also don't let him lose adequate sleep, as long as the work is not too stressful, we always let him rest fully. Since joining the work, especially when he is around Yaoqun, we never let him endure fatigue, so as not to hinder his development. But I can predict that when he grows up, his endurance will definitely not be less than that of Mr. W.

Regarding my personal sleep problem, it's a bit of a myth. At first, during my student days, I relied on some strong memory skills. I usually only read miscellaneous books and never studied my lessons. When it came to exams, I only needed one or two all-nighters to pass all ten or so subjects; in some subjects, I could even get the best grades.

The myth originated from a time during the old system's high school graduation exam. Several of the main subject teachers happened to be fierce gods and evil spirits from the Twenty-Eight Mansions. I had tasted their flavor during several monthly exams; in addition to the regular writing, they also used hidden tricks. Especially that math and science director, he treated students as his enemies of seven lifetimes. At least five out of ten test questions were obscure materials scraped from the cracks in the textbook. So the whole class, regardless of whether they usually worked hard or not, had to pull all-nighters for the sake of "diploma supremacy." And this graduation exam lasted five or six days; even the best spirit could not sustain five or six nights; moreover, during the day, they had to go through "a hammering-style exam with fatigue bombing."

At that time, I met a theology student (I heard that he is now a receptionist at a famous temple in Hangzhou). He looked at us pitifully and taught us a kind of "sleep sparsing" method, changing eight hours of sleep into twelve fragmented rests; it was called something like "Rest and Cease Zen Gong," each rest only required about ten minutes; and there was no need to go to bed, it could be done anywhere. The mantra was seven steps: "Sit peacefully," "Lower the eyelids," "Support the knees," "Feet firmly on the ground," "Focus," "Circulate the breath through the heavens," "Awaken." The first four steps are of course easy to understand and do, in other words, it is to settle down each part of the body, let go of worries, and entrust yourself to the chair you are sitting on and the piece of ground your feet are on. "Focus" means imagining your eyes looking at your lower dantian, the center point of a round ball. "Circulating the breath through the heavens" means treating all the organs and meridians of the body as the five lakes and four seas, and starting up the imagined small ball, walking along the seabed, rising along the back, passing through all parts of the brain, flowing through the joints of the left or right limbs, pausing at each joint, like traveling through the five lakes and four seas, until it has traveled throughout the body and returned to its original position.

### Waterwheel

— Hu Yingdong

For people who grow up in a water village, water is the source of their life. Look at the green waves of the rice fields, even under the scorching sun, they still grow strong and energetic.

The waterwheel makes rhythmic sounds by the lake.

Under a cool shed, the bare-chested peasant has a purple, shiny chest, dark, thick, and strong legs, stepping up and down. In this way, see how the water flows tricklingly from the lake into the rice fields, even the frogs in the rice fields happily begin to sing; the crops straighten their backs to welcome the water source, swaying in the wind, green smiles unfolding in the fields. The waterwheel turns.

The green waves undulate, the peasant sweats, his eyes filled with hope, humming a village song, letting the waterwheel turn endlessly...

The revelation of power, the rush of water, the leap of sweat and hope.

The people of the water village place their hopes in the singing of the waterwheel, it, the working mother of the water village, has abundant milk to nurture the fields,...

The sound of labor resounds in every corner of the summer water village.

Summer, a season of growth, the laborers of the water village will not waste it.

Shanghai Jottings

### Assisting the Families of Martyred Journalists

— Shilang

Worthy of our pride, during the enemy-puppet period, many journalists fought the enemy indomitably. Many people fell in pools of blood, many were intimidated, many lost their freedom, many were tortured and became disabled. This is indeed a brilliant and splendid page in the history of journalism.

But the families of those martyred journalists are living a life of poverty and disease. Those reporters who suffered brutal torture by the enemy-puppets and are still lingering in hospital beds are rarely cared for.

The reason why these martyred and suffering reporters are so righteous and heroic is that they have only one belief: only the interests of the nation matter, not personal interests. They do not compromise, do not betray, do not fall into the water, refuse all threats and temptations, and are unwilling to collude with the enemy-puppets. This is something worth writing about in detail.

Although they were in Shanghai, they were no different from those fighting on the front lines; bombs and guns threatened and exploded around them every day, but this did not shake their beliefs.

Now, this newspaper is raising donations for the families of martyred journalists. Anyone with a sense of justice will certainly not refuse this request; anyone who knows a little about the history of how foreign merchant newspapers fought against the enemy-puppets will certainly be more generous and willing to donate. Why not offer a little money as a token of our respect for the families of martyred journalists?

The dead are gone, but the living are still enduring hardships and supporting this difficult life. We cannot reduce our psychological guilt except by providing practical assistance.

Free Talk

### Marshall and Wedemeyer

— Lei Ying

Many people seem to think that the policies of Marshall and Wedemeyer are completely different. Many people also say that Marshall's failure in China has tarnished his reputation.

They don't know that Eisenhower was originally just a junior officer under MacArthur. It was Marshall who personally promoted him and allowed him to take charge of his own affairs. They don't know that it was not the "executor" Eisenhower who was responsible for deciding on the Normandy landing and opening up the second front, which eventually led to the collapse of Nazi Germany, but the "decision-maker" Marshall. They may not even know that it was Marshall who personally promoted Wedemeyer from a sergeant who had just returned from studying in Germany in 1938 to a colonel in 1940, and then gradually promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general in six years!

Although General Wedemeyer is already silver-haired, he is actually one of the younger and more junior generals in the US military. His talent has made him stand out in the history of American military strategy; therefore, his relatively "late" start today may indicate a more brilliant and unlimited future. Many American experts are already whispering that he is the most likely successor to Marshall and Eisenhower. From August 1936 to June 1938, Wedemeyer interned at the German Army Academy in Berlin. He was a "mindful" person who paid attention to everything. After returning home, he immediately submitted a thick report of one hundred summers to the Army Department. Coincidentally, the general in the US Army Department who was responsible for this type of report was the now famous Marshall—, he was then Brigadier General Marshall.

Marshall was greatly impressed when he saw this report. From then on, he maintained constant contact with Wedemeyer. By 1940, Wedemeyer had become one of General Marshall's most important advisors.

In April 1942, the US General Staff, based on all the most reliable intelligence and various statistical materials, determined that 1943 was the best opportunity to cross the English Channel and directly land in Normandy. Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, accompanied by General Marshall and Marshall's staff, flew to England to seek the British side's agreement to the US General Staff's opinion. After several days of debate at 10 Downing Street, King George himself finally adopted the US proposal. However, two months later, Lord Mountbatten (the current Governor-General of India) suddenly flew from England to England and became a guest of the White House. He repeatedly stated that it was inappropriate to open up a second front in 1943, first expressing doubt, and later providing firm arguments. He stayed for two weeks, and on June 18, Churchill himself also arrived at the White House. His speech was much better than Mountbatten's. He said that the Allied people were suffering in the depths of misery, and the army should not delay any longer. He suggested immediately attacking the Mediterranean, with a particular focus on the Balkans. Although Churchill's arguments were well-reasoned, Marshall and Roosevelt were both very clear in their hearts that Churchill was playing the game of the British Empire. Churchill opposed the Normandy landings; he said that the German army had not been weakened, and if they were rashly attempted, it would inevitably cause a second Dunkirk.

After Churchill's eloquent speech ended, Roosevelt immediately consulted with Marshall. After Marshall quietly listened to the President's opinion, he immediately turned around and said to a slender colonel, "You can talk about why the United States must insist on the Normandy landing, and why the war must be conducted in 1943."

This colonel immediately stated the various reasons in an orderly manner, and even Churchill's eloquence paled in comparison to the calm expert's judgment.

This slender colonel was the current Lieutenant General Wedemeyer. He recited all the figures and accurately predicted the Soviet counteroffensive, which coincided with the 1943 plan.

Roosevelt finally adopted a compromise: the strategy was based on the American army, the Normandy landings, and the time was based on the British army, delayed by one year, and changed to 1944.

To this day, everything has proved the accuracy of the American estimates. In the summer of 1943, the German army had only twenty-nine divisions. By the time the landing operation began in 1944, the German army had been replenished to fifty-eight divisions. The Allied forces' one-year delay in operations also strengthened the German defenses on the Western Front. Moreover, in the winter of 1942, the Soviet army was struggling to recover Stalingrad. If the Allied forces had attacked in 1943, then the Soviet Union would have no place to intervene in Germany today.

It was Marshall who insisted on this 1943 offensive plan; it was then-Colonel Wedemeyer who formulated this plan. From this, we can see how deep the relationship between Marshall and Wedemeyer is.

### Such a Dad

— Luo Ta

Our daughter had a fever for more than ten days, and I had to get up every night to serve her, which made me very tired. Finally, I said to my husband, "If she cries again tonight, you get up." That night, she cried that she wanted to drink boiled water. I woke up my husband, and he jumped up, ran to the kitchen, poured a glass of boiled water, drank it himself, and then went back to bed and fell asleep soundly.

### That Person, Yu Ji

— Zhou Leng

! Miscellaneous Theories of Wei and Jin People, Part Three

The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, written by Luo Guanzhong, portrays Yu Ji as a man of esoteric arts, saying he could summon wind and rain, achieve liberation from the body, and even, in the end, use sorcery to frighten Sun Ce, a man of great ability, to death. But in my view, Yu Ji was actually a peasant leader engaged in secret work who unfortunately failed midway, a theorist who educated the peasants and encouraged them to rise up in struggle.

To support this argument, I need to list facts in detail. However, because his historical materials have been distorted and pruned by scholars of past dynasties, it is quite difficult. But one thing can be confirmed, and that is: from the "Yellow Turban" rebellion launched by Zhang Jiao in the first year of Zhongping during the reign of Emperor Ling (184 AD) to the disintegration of the "Rice Rebels" led by Zhang Lu in the twentieth year of Da'an during the reign of Emperor Ling (215 AD), throughout these decades of peasant uprisings in China, their thoughts and actions can be said to have been influenced and incited by Yu Ji's theories. The Biography of Xiang Kai in the History of the Later Han Dynasty states:

"Initially, during the reign of Emperor Shun, Gong Chong of Langya presented a book to the emperor, claiming it was bestowed upon Yu Ji. The book was obtained on the Ququan River and consisted of one hundred and seventy volumes of divine texts, called the Book of Great Peace and Purity. The officials reported that it was deceptive and preposterous, so it was collected and stored away. Later, Zhang Jiao possessed many of its books."

In general, in any planned peasant uprising in feudal society, whether in China or abroad, at the beginning, they almost all used the guise of gods as a tool for their activities and expressed their political consciousness through religious creeds. Recent examples include the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution in the Qing Dynasty, and more distant examples include the German Millennial Anabaptist War. Considering Yu Ji's time, it was precisely on the eve of the Yellow Turban rebellion. The social environment, according to the Food and Goods Chronicle in Book 26 of the History of Jin, was as follows: "In the first year of Yongxing during the reign of Emperor Huan, a large part of the kingdoms suffered from locusts. The Yellow River overflowed for thousands of miles, displacing hundreds of thousands of households. In the early years of Jianning and Yonghe, the western barbarians rebelled. For more than twenty years, wars continued and the army grew old. Military expenses amounted to more than 320 billion, and the imperial treasury was empty. During the chaos of Dong Zhuo, grain cost 500,000 per dan, and beans and wheat cost 200,000. People ate each other, and white bones piled up. The remains and leftover meat stank in the streets." Imagine, as peasants who were ruled over, if their lives were so unbearable, they would naturally develop the thought of taking risks. Therefore, Yu Ji happened to discover a divine book at this time. The book was also deceptive and preposterous. Judging by common sense, the so-called divine book was probably a small booklet he wrote himself, a kind of propaganda that criticized society and encouraged struggle. In order to hide it from others' attention, he fabricated a myth to rely on. Otherwise, why wouldn't Yu Ji hide it like other sorcerers and take advantage of it for personal gain? Moreover, why would the officials even obtain it and present it to claim credit? Furthermore, why would Zhang Jiao raise an army after having this book?

At the same time, based on Yu Ji's own behavior, it can be further understood that he was extremely ambitious. The commentary in the Biography of Sun Ce in the Book of Wu in the Records of the Three Kingdoms quotes Jiang Biao Zhuan with a wonderful description:

"Yu Ji first resided in the east, traveling to and from Wu and Kuaiji. He established a refined residence, burned incense, read Taoist books, and created talismanic water to cure diseases. Many people in Wu and Kuaiji served him. Sun Ce once gathered his generals and guests in the tower above the city gate. Yu Ji then approached in grand attire. Two-thirds of the generals and guests below the gate went down to greet and bow to him. Those who tried to stop him could not. Sun Ce immediately ordered his arrest. Those who served him all had women enter to see Sun Ce's mother and teach her. His mother advised Sun Ce. Sun Ce said: 'This son is deceitful and can confuse the minds of the masses, causing the generals to no longer observe the rites between ruler and subject. He must be eliminated.' The generals again jointly submitted a petition, but Sun Ce did not listen and immediately ordered him to be beheaded and his head displayed in the market."

Assuming that Yu Ji was simply a sorcerer, he would never travel to and from Wu and Kuaiji and serve the common people so diligently. If he did not have organizational relationships with the generals and guests of Eastern Wu, he would not have had such great power, even to the point of making them forget the rites between ruler and subject and "go down to greet and bow." The reason why Yu Ji was killed was probably not only because Sun Ce saw that he was very popular, but also because his underground work had achieved great results and the organized forces had played a great role. Therefore, perhaps he relied on a peasant's heroic spirit to deliberately show off his power to Sun Ce during his meeting; or perhaps his plan had matured and he planned to start an uprising at that time, but as a result, Sun Ce caught him and had him beheaded. Otherwise, how could Sun Ce, such a famous filial son, dare to go against his mother's words? Why would the generals and guests jointly submit a petition? Afterwards, Records of Searching for Spirits and others also said that Yu Ji took his life? Comparing and associating these events with each other shows that the inside story must not be as simple as described on the surface.

Puppet Shows in America

Puppet shows are a Chinese product. Puppet shows looked like this a hundred years ago, and they still look like this now. One puppet requires the puppeteer to stand behind a cloth curtain, manipulating the clumsy puppet and singing out-of-tune tunes to earn sporadic coins from peddlers, porters, and street children. There is also a type of itinerant performer called "spirit mediums," whose stomachs can talk, but the voice is very small, and one must press one's ear close to their belly to hear it. In reality, it's not their stomachs that are talking, but still their throats, the sound going down, as if muffled in the belly. Neither of these professions amount to much, allowing one to make a living but making it difficult to rise to prominence. Americans are different. Hollywood produced a man named Bergen, who combined "puppets" and "spirit mediums" into one. He speaks with his mouth closed, loudly and fluently. Even in a theater with more than a thousand people, his voice can resonate throughout the entire theater. He raises his right leg, and on his knee sits a puppet named Charlie wearing a tuxedo. Its facial features and limbs can all move. Bergen speaks on behalf of Charlie on the one hand, and on behalf of himself on the other. He can even incorporate the intonation of a third person, representing three people all by himself. The dramatic language is mainly based on humorous dialogue. Bergen cherishes his cash cow, Charlie, with meticulous care. Charlie's bedroom contains a large number of costumes, but in reality, Charlie always wears the same old tuxedo, an old bow tie, and a pair of monocles when he goes on stage. Now there are many people in America who are following suit. Their puppets come in all ages and genders, and their comedic skills can also quickly catch up. But their fame and appeal are not as great as Charlie's. Charlie has a scene in the movie "Hollywood Canteen," and Charlie has also been invited to the President's Office, sitting next to Mrs. Roosevelt, becoming a guest of the White House, winning a lot of applause. This kind of talented person becomes a first-class artist in America, but in China, they become street performers or swindlers who control the spirits of the dead. How lamentable! (Editor's note: If there is an opportunity, I hope Mr. Xu will talk about string puppet shows.) (24)

### Summer Records by the Window

Zhu Gao's Tomb

Behind the Xia Hill of the West Lake Building, there is Niu Gao's tomb. Niu Gao was a great general under Yue Wumu, and he can also be called a national hero. However, the desolate ruins and ancient trees are desolate, and few tourists know the tomb of Marquis Fuwen. It is said that, "Once there was a shepherd boy who passed the ridge with the setting sun, squatting on a stone to urinate. Suddenly, a great man, black and bearded, angrily scolded him, saying: 'I am Niu Gao, why do you urinate on my head?' and pushed him into a stream, more than ten feet deep. A grave backed by a ravine, covered with weeds. It was indeed Gao's tomb. So, those who were fond of good deeds began to renovate it slightly." This legend is of course absurd and unreliable. With the Marquis's bravery and loyalty, if his heroic spirit were immortal, he would never manifest himself to a small shepherd boy. However, from this, it can also be seen that even for heroes, their posthumous glory and honor are fortunate and unfortunate. Lin Shu of Minhou also recorded a section about Niu Gao's tomb, saying, "One day, I visited the Ziyun Cave and inadvertently asked the residents, and then I found the tomb of Marquis Fuwen. The tomb was built with stones in a circular shape, almost completely covered with thorns. There was no way to reach the tomb. At that time, the host of my eastern tour was Mr. Chen, who was then teaching in Renhe County. I asked Mr. Chen to repair the Marquis's tomb. Mr. Chen agreed and took out three hundred gold, which he paid to the servants, Huang Fu. I wrote the epitaph, but Huang was stingy with the Marquis's tomb, but generously with the pavilion. The tomb was only cleared of grass, but the pavilion was splendid and gilded, with stones as pillars. One night there was a great thunderstorm, and the pavilion collapsed, but the epitaph remained standing. I secretly sighed and said that I was still waiting for his spirit."

Few people know about this matter, and it can be considered a local anecdote of West Lake. However, as time passes and days change, thorns and weeds have grown again, and human traces are rarely seen. Brother Niu is really unlucky. Now only the epitaph "Tomb of Niu Gong, Marquis Fuwen of the Song Dynasty" is still recognizable, said to be inscribed by Chen Xiao. Alas, where can one find someone else who likes good deeds to drive away the underground foxes for Brother Niu?

### Fish Species in the Deep Sea

— Wang Ge Liang

The sea still contains many mysterious riddles! The highest diving record for us humans is only about 1,000 meters. The average depth of the sea is about 3,000 to 6,000 meters. In 1927, the German warship "Emden" discovered a deep sea of 10,830 meters on the eastern sea of Mindanao Island in the Philippine Islands. Its depth is the highest in the world. If the world's highest peak—Mount Everest—were put in, you still wouldn't be able to see the tip of the peak! (Still half a nautical mile short!)

Generally, people think that the fish species must have difficulties living in places 2,000 meters below the sea surface because of food. However, according to the reports of previous investigation teams, they unexpectedly found fish species inhabiting the deep sea areas they investigated. In the deep sea of 6,000 meters, most of these deep-sea fish species are black or light gray, with few scales, and have a leather-like epidermis. There are various sizes of fish, ranging from two to three inches long to five to six feet long.

Researchers of biology from European and American countries often venture into the seabed in deep-sea diving spheres made of steel to observe the living conditions of deep-sea fish. On the way to sinking to the seabed in a diving sphere, the color of the sea changes from blue to green, to gray. When it exceeds 500 meters, it becomes pitch black. However, in the windows of the diving sphere equipped with strong lighting equipment, you can still see all kinds of rare and exotic things. For example, there is a kind of fish that has whip-like appendages on its lower jaw and tail, and it emits strange and beautiful light. There is also a kind of fish whose own volume is very small, but it can swallow fish that are larger than its own body. Its stomach is inflated like a sail of a sailboat. The fish it swallows are all curled up and stored in its stomach, and it slowly digests them. There is another kind of fish that has a hook wire about four times longer than itself, protruding from its upper jaw. And the front end of that hook wire also has luminous objects specially designed to lure seabirds. It hides in the crevices of reefs, quietly waiting for the arrival of seabirds. Seabirds float leisurely on the waves, attracted by the luminous objects on the rocks, and then this wonderful little fish can suddenly catch the seabird and use it as a rich dinner.

The most interesting and strange thing is the male fish with the scientific name "Spinipus." It only adheres to the female fish like a tumor. Its mouth is completely fused with the female body, and it cannot eat or digest on its own. It relies entirely on the nutrition of the female fish to live. Its only duty is to fertilize the female fish. It is truly a veritable "parasite."
