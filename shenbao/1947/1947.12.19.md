### Chairman's Instructions on Financial Plan: Economic Pacification More Important Than Military; Four Joint Council Decides to Continue Loan Suspension

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The chairman of the Four Joint Treasury Supervisory Council is concurrently held by the Chairman of the National Government. As this year's end approaches, Chairman Chiang specially convened a meeting of all council members at the National Government at 10:00 AM on the 18th to review past work. At the meeting, the Chairman gave important instructions on the current economic, financial, and loan issues. Firstly, regarding the general economic situation, he instructed: "Currently, economic pacification is actually more important than military pacification. Therefore, we must regulate the economy through finance and lead the national economy. If financial control is well-managed, our self-reliance will be no problem." Secondly, he gave the following four instructions on loan policies: (A) The four banks' lending in the coming year will continue to adopt a tight policy. (B) All necessary loans should especially focus on absorbing floating capital in the market. (The Chairman pointed out the floating capital of commercial banks when explaining this point). (C) The loan plan and budget for the coming year need to be jointly drafted by the Ministry of Finance and the Four Joint Treasury Supervisory Council and submitted to the Chairman for approval. (D) Use political power to stabilize fluctuations in the financial market, including cracking down on the financial black market. Around 11:00 AM, the Chairman left early to preside over Zhang Ji's funeral and was replaced by Vice Chairman Zhang to preside over the meeting. Then, Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Four Joint Treasury Supervisory Council, reported on the loan business of the past year in great detail. The attending council members then expressed their opinions on the Chairman's instructions. The meeting ended at around 12:00 PM. The meeting also passed the revised draft of measures to strengthen the regulation of financial business submitted by the Executive Yuan. In addition, the heads of relevant agencies and the heads of various banks were designated to hold a review meeting in the afternoon to discuss future directions. The review meeting was held at the Bank of Communications at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. From 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, the meeting resumed in the conference room of the Executive Yuan to continue discussions. After 8:00 PM, the Chairman invited the attendees to a dinner at his official residence and exchanged opinions. The meeting ended late at night. As for the important decisions made at the meeting, the participants refused to disclose them, only stating that it was a comprehensive review of finance. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The loan issue of national banks and bureaus is being closely watched by all parties. Chairman Chiang also expressed great concern about this, hence the move to personally preside over the Four Joint Treasury Supervisory Council. According to relevant sources, the loan suspension will remain temporarily until prices stabilize, and then discussions will be held. However, some new national construction and daily necessities, as well as export materials for foreign exchange, will be reopened. The detailed measures are still being studied by the parties concerned.

[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 18th Dispatch] The tense situation in Zhengzhou has passed. Chen Yi's bandit vanguard retreated to Weishi, and his follow-up troops were also defeated by the National Army in Tongxu and East Bian. Chen Geng's main force is still in the area south of Yongning, and the situation in Xuchang is unknown. A group of Liu's bandits attacked the Xinyang-Huangchuan Highway, and the main force of the northward fleeing troops is still in the Xuanhuadian area. [Our Newspaper, Kaifeng, 17th Dispatch] Chen Yi's 11th Column, which attacked Lanfeng, has now fled to Wangtun, outside the East City Wall of Kaifeng. The defending troops are fighting fiercely against them in the severe cold. The bandit's 1st Column has fled to Baimugang, more than ten miles south of Kaifeng, and its headquarters has occupied Zhuxian Town. Hundreds of thousands of citizens in Kaifeng are now cooperating with the defending troops with enthusiastic emotions to strengthen the city's defenses. They are all automatically comforting the defending troops. Hundreds of students from Henan University have requested to join the Kaifeng Defense War. [Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 18th Dispatch] On the 18th, the Kaifeng National Army continued its full-scale offensive, sweeping in three directions: southeast, southwest, and south. The scattered bandits lingering on the periphery of Kaifeng were defeated at the sight of the wind. Currently, there are no bandits within 20 miles around Kaifeng. In addition, more than 10,000 bandits who fled to Zhuxian Town fled to the southeast and south of Zhi on the evening of the 17th. The bandits on the Lanfeng side also fled mostly to the northeast and east. The National Army advancing from the east of Kaifeng has driven out the communist bandits between Xinglong and Luowang and is advancing towards Lanfeng. They will be able to join forces within days, and there are no communist bandits between Bian and Zheng. Many cavalry from Zhengzhou arrived in Bian safely today. [Our Newspaper, Hankou, 18th Dispatch] Military News: The main force of Liu's 1st Column crossed the Yellow River from Dabukou on the 17th. Currently, there are no bandits north of the Xinyang-Huangchuan Highway, south of the Huai River, and west of the Huang River. The main force of the 6th Bandit Column fled north across the Huangchuan-Gushi Highway from the Yagang-Zhupidian area southeast of Huangchuan on the 17th. The National Army is pursuing and suppressing them near Baisudian. After the remnants of the 12th Bandit Column were defeated by the National Army, a remnant force joined Zhang Jian's bandit force and crossed the Fu River from Pinglin (northwest of Anlu) and fled to the Luoyangdian Weishan area south of Suixian on the morning of the 17th. [Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 18th Dispatch] The communist bandit Wei Fenglou's troops, who invaded Yutai, were forced to retreat northward under the pressure of powerful troops, suffering heavy losses. The evacuated government personnel in Yutai have returned to the city. The middle reaches of the Huai River are peaceful, and traffic is normal. [Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 18th Dispatch] The Northeast Communist Bandits' Seventh Offensive began on the 12th, destroying the Daling River Bridge on the Beining Railway, with Shenyang as the target. They adopted a strategy of infiltration and drilling gaps, seeking the core, and advancing through gaps in the north, west, and east. The northern route consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, and 10th Columns. The 6th Division of their 2nd Column was head-on attacked by the National Army in the area of Sanjiazhi, Shahousuo, 15 kilometers southwest of Faku, at 2:00 PM on the 17th and began to collapse. 5,000 to 6,000 people were captured. The National Army is forcing a general sweep and advanced to Tongjiangkou that night. The bandits suffered extremely heavy blows. The western bandits, the 9th Column, are between Heishan and Xinlitun, with only a small part reaching the Huanliu River East and Longdian area, and have not dared to take any offensive action. The southern bandits are now divided into two groups and are heading towards the outer strongholds of Shenyang. One group is approaching the Xiaotun Cement Plant along the railway, threatening Liaoyang to the west. The other group is pressing Sujiatun westward along the Shenyang-Anshan Railway from Benxi. Shiqiaozhi and Waitoushan Station, northwest of Benxi, were occupied on the 17th, and their vanguard advanced to the vicinity of Yaoqianhutun, which is closer to Sujiatun. Sujiatun is a major stronghold on the south bank of the Hun River in southern Shenyang. The National Army is head-on attacking them. Another group is causing disturbances near the Yantai Coal Mine between Sujiatun and Liaoyang. The Changchun Railway train was still able to reach Tanggangzi south of Anshan on the 18th. The National Army is opening its mouth to let the bandits drill in and has begun the "eating" tactic. Shahousuo on the northern route is the first bite to swallow and will continue to swallow. The bandits are already worried about this. According to military agencies, the bandits' attempt to dig out the heart has failed, and the next step may be to adopt an encirclement policy. However, after the bandit main force is defeated, the National Army can expand even more. The authorities expressed that they have a very effective way to deal with this offensive and said that the outcome can be determined in two weeks. [Central News Agency, Shenyang, 18th Dispatch] The Liaonan bandit army began to cause disturbances: The 4th Division of the 8th Bandit Column invaded Ximucheng (southeast of Haicheng) on the 16th. The backbone regiment of the 3rd Military Sub-district of the bandits sneaked into the Gaojiawaizi military station (northeast of Benxi) on the evening of the 17th.

Taixing County Security Team Recaptures Tianxingqiao Town; Xinghua Security Team Raids Bandit Nest [Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 18th Dispatch] On the night of the 8th of this month, the communist bandits in northern Jiangsu attacked Tianxingqiao in Taixing County, engaging in a fierce battle with the self-defense team. After three hours, the self-defense team, outnumbered, transferred to the Dashengqiao defense area. On the 9th, the county government continued to send the county security team to cooperate with the self-defense team to counterattack Tianxingqiao. They arrived at Fangguozhuang at noon and encountered more than 100 bandits. After a fierce attack, the bandits were defeated and retreated. The town was recaptured before dusk, and communication was established with the navy in the Yangtze River. County Magistrate Bu of Xinghua recently led the security team and the self-defense team of the third district to cooperate with the navy and launched a sweep from Donggaozhuang, raiding the bandit nest of Nanbei Furong in one fell swoop. They engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits, killing dozens of them. The bandits were defeated and retreated, and Nanbei Furong and nearby villages were recaptured. They are now building fortifications there to advance. County Magistrate of Baoying led his troops to the northern township on the morning of the 5th to suppress the bandits, detouring to the sixth district and directly attacking Weijiadong, recapturing the location of the bandit county government.

Chu Xichun's Flight Fails; Aircraft Malfunction Causes Return; Sun Lianzhong Hastens to Handle the Closing of Two Agencies [Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] Chu Xichun flew from Ping to Shen this afternoon, but the aircraft malfunctioned mid-flight and returned. [Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] The newly appointed Capital Garrison Commander Sun Lianzhong met with reporters from this newspaper at his private residence today and said that the official order for his new position has not yet arrived in Ping. He has been busy holding meetings in recent days to close the "stalls" of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters and the Hebei Provincial Government. Once everything is in order, he will go to Nanjing to take office. He claimed that he is not used to life in big cities and would still like to visit the defense areas under his jurisdiction after taking office in Nanjing, rather than spending his days socializing. Sun was wearing a loose-fitting robe and looked relaxed when he met with reporters. This afternoon at 5:00 PM, Fu Zuoyi visited Sun to discuss issues such as personnel arrangements after the closure of the Pacification Headquarters.

Minister Bai Goes to Hunan [Our Newspaper, Changsha, 18th Dispatch] Bai Chongxi arrived in Hunan on the 18th by special train on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. He will arrive in Changsha on the morning of the 19th. All commissioners and county magistrates were summoned to Changsha to receive instructions. It is said that after Minister Bai arrives in Hunan, he will attend the provincial assembly meeting that is currently being held. [Our Newspaper, Hankou, 18th Dispatch] Minister Bai and Tang Enbo visited Chairman Wan today.

Foreign Minister Wang Meets with the Minister to Conduct a Profound Review of the Overall Situation; Hopes for Support of Our Position on the Japanese Peace Conference [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang met with Ambassador Stuart at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 5:45 PM on the 18th and had an important talk lasting one and a half hours, with a detailed and profound review of the world, the Far East, and Sino-U.S. relations. According to people in the know, U.S. policy towards China will have new developments, and future assistance will inevitably be strengthened. The person also analyzed the consequences of the breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers Conference, which has made the world's confrontation clearer and more tense. After Marshall's unpleasant departure from the Foreign Ministers Conference, he discussed the merger of the British, American, and French occupation zones in western Germany with Bevin and Bidault, declaring the German peace conference hopeless. The path for the United States and the Soviet Union to seek cooperation in Europe has been cut off, and the Elbe River has finally become a crack in the earth. If no other way can be found to break the deadlock in the future, the world will inevitably be driven to war. Marshall also plans to rush back to the United States, symbolizing that the U.S. diplomatic policy urgently needs to be reviewed and rapidly revised to cope with the subsequent situation and possible accidents. Marshall may still have some hope for the Japanese peace conference, or even regard it as a last resort, starting from the Far East to solve the stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union, but it is not known how effective this move will be. However, no matter what, the U.S. position in the Far East urgently needs to be strengthened, there is no doubt about that. Foreign Minister Wang may have proposed to the minister on the 18th to support China's position, because the Chinese government has not yet abandoned its advocacy of the Japanese peace conference and has long publicly stated that the Far East issue is simpler than the European issue. The satisfactory signing of the Japanese peace treaty can promote the opening of the U.S.-Soviet stalemate. However, if the Japanese peace conference continues to be deadlocked due to procedural discrimination, China has no other way but to strengthen its own strength. The news that the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party signed a military agreement has received high attention from political figures in Beijing. This news may not be groundless. The action of the United States to aid China really cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, Foreign Minister Wang's meeting with the minister is the most important thing. Sino-U.S. relations will inevitably have new developments in the chaotic world situation.

Supreme Court Procuratorate Issues Arrest Warrant for He Long [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The Supreme Court Procuratorate recently issued an arrest warrant for the communist bandit mastermind He Long (from Sangzhi, Hunan, now at large).

U.S. State Department Considers Special Aid to China Plan; to be Submitted to Congress Early Next Year [U.S. Information Service, Washington, 17th Dispatch] A State Department spokesman today supported the government's policy of aid to China, assuring the Senate Appropriations Committee that, in addition to the current European recovery plan, the government will submit a specific plan for aid to China to Congress early next year. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thorp told the committee that the United States has provided more than one billion U.S. dollars to China since the victory over Japan and that more will be needed in the future. He said that the State Department has been considering the situation in China since China was included in the congressional-approved temporary aid bill to France, Italy, and Austria. Zipp said that the temporary relief plan for China could include obtaining wheat, kerosene, rice, medicines, and other items, but he believes that certain special needs for relief in Europe may be limited due to the funds allocated to China. [United Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Thorp and the Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the State Department, former Minister Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in China, Bedell Smith, both attended the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 17th to express their views and avoided answering questions from congressmen about whether the Soviet Union was assisting the Chinese Communist Party. Thorp declared that the amount of U.S. aid to China after the war has exceeded one billion yuan, including UNRRA relief, Lend-Lease, and surplus materials. The State Department is now drafting a special aid to China bill, which will be submitted to Congress after January next year. The 27.7 million yuan aid bill passed by the previous session of Congress is also being implemented. Committee Chairman Bridges questioned the State Department on the spot, asking why China was not included in the assistance to various countries to resist communism. Thorp replied that he did not know. He only said that the aid to China bill is currently being drafted, and this bill is limited to emergency relief to European countries. Judge Yide also asked about the supply of weapons to the Chinese government army. Bedell Smith replied that this matter is underway, and the air force equipment is also included. In addition to the recent signing of an agreement to supply China with air force equipment, the State Department will also approve the shipment of weapons and ammunition to China. [United Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Thorp provided the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee on the 17th with a preliminary plan for temporary aid to China, preparing to authorize the use of 60 million U.S. dollars for China in the relief bill after the final allocation is designated by Congress. He said that the funds may be used for the following purposes: The distribution of rice, which will be similar to the Italian relief bill, with approximately 24 million U.S. dollars used for this purpose. Approximately 18 million U.S. dollars will be used to supply 38 million barrels of oil and petroleum products. The remaining funds after offsetting the income and expenditure of this plan will be used to purchase more rice or cotton. This is the first time that the State Department has revealed the content of the aid to China plan after the aid to China fund is approved. (The response of the Beijing political circles to Wedemeyer's strong promotion of aid to China is published in the left corner of page 2)

Bullitt and Judd Strongly Advocate Economic and Military Aid to China; Current War in China is the Prelude to the Third World War [Associated Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt declared to the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 17th that aid to China should precede aid to France, Italy, and Austria. The government is now arming the enemy, while Congress refuses to arm its allies. The State Department has ample time to allocate relief plans and promised to submit them to Congress after January next year. Unfortunately, the State Department's policy completely misunderstood that the Soviet Union is a peace-loving country and that the Chinese Communist Party is only an agrarian reformist and has nothing to do with Moscow. Although it is fortunate to realize it now, the time between thought and design has been long. A part of the Senate asked whether Mr. Bullitt believed that the State Department was hindering the discussion of further aid to China. He did not answer directly, only saying that Ambassador Stuart repeatedly sent urgent telegrams requesting increased aid, but he did not receive a polite reply. This matter is well known in Washington and elsewhere. Committee Chairman Bridges asked again whether the U.S. representatives in China were competent. Mr. Bullitt replied that we urgently need first-class talents to handle all U.S. benefits in China. Since military affairs are paramount, the United States must send Meng Shuai to China. If MacArthur cannot go, then a general with the most experience in dealing with the Communist Party should be sent instead, such as General Clark. Mr. Bullitt also said that the United States supplied China with weapons and ammunition during the war, but from May 1946 to May 1947, it banned exports to China. Since then, China has never obtained a box of ammunition to replenish American-made rifles, or a shell to replenish American-made cannons. The Chinese government army is confronting well-equipped communist troops, and at least part of the communist troops' equipment comes from Soviet-seized factories in the Northeast. At the same time, Congressman Judd declared that aid to China is the best way to avoid the Third World War with the Soviet Union and its vassals. We do not need to include China in the emergency foreign aid funds currently being discussed, but at least 60 million U.S. dollars should be reserved for early aid to China. The current war in China is not a civil war, but the first small contact of the Third World War. It is necessary to keep the Chinese government strong and help it defeat communism. When the Japanese army in the Northeast surrendered, the Soviet Union seized Japanese weapons and supplies and left them for the communist army to occupy. Unless the central government gains the moral, economic, and military support of the United States, it will inevitably collapse, and the communist production of justice to rule Asia is like a prairie fire. China is one of the world's major countries, and it is very dangerous if it is controlled by the Soviet Union.

U.S. House of Representatives Passes Deletion of China Section of Foreign Aid Bill; Bill Sent to Senate for Discussion [Associated Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] The House of Representatives passed the Appropriations Committee's recommendation on the 17th by voice vote, reducing 88 million U.S. dollars from the 597 million U.S. dollars in the foreign aid bill and deleting the China relief section. The bill is now sent to the Senate for discussion, and the Senate may restore the original bill and include the China section. On the same day, President Truman also signed the 597 million U.S. dollar aid bill for China, France, Italy, and Austria. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges, upon hearing the results of the House vote, said that he would convene the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 18th to hold a vote and said: "I personally hope to include the China section, but it is difficult to say how the committee will vote." He said: "China has become an orphan under consideration by the United States and should be given preferential treatment in preventing dictatorship and the spread of communism throughout the world." He hopes that the Senate Appropriations Committee can submit the bill to the Senate for a vote by noon on Friday.

Canada Sells Us Arms; Second Batch Shipped to China [Associated Press, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, 18th Dispatch] Port authorities announced that more than 15 million rounds of small arms ammunition and hundreds of tons of air force ground equipment, worth 1.2 million U.S. dollars, are scheduled to be loaded onto the "Corima" ship on the 18th and will sail to Wusong, China on the 19th for use by the Chinese army. Government officials in Ottawa stated that this is part of the 10.5 million U.S. dollar Mosquito aircraft recently purchased by China from Canada, and it is entirely an economic matter and has no political motives. According to the agreement between the two parties, Canada will ship the remaining 170 surplus aircraft, along with guns, ammunition, and ground equipment. This is the second delivery, and the first one was shipped from Montreal a few weeks ago.

Sui High Court is Planning to Set Up an Extra-Mural Prison in Hetao [Central News Agency, Guihua, 18th Dispatch] Sui High Court President Yu Cunhao reported in the Sui Provincial Assembly yesterday that the situation in Hetao Yimeng is most suitable for setting up an extra-mural prison, and the conditions are quite complete. The Sui High Court has always paid attention to extra-mural operations for prisoners, using it as an implementation experiment, and has achieved great results. After the restoration, more prisoners with labor force were selected to organize extra-mural work teams to conduct further experiments, which have been even more effective. Because the construction equipment and administrative expenses of the extra-mural prison require a large amount of funds, the local area is really unable to organize it. Therefore, at the National Judicial Administration Review Conference this year, the Sui High Court proposed the establishment of an extra-mural prison in Hetao as the central proposal, which was approved by the conference and sent to the Ministry for handling. A specific plan is now being planned and is expected to be prepared in 1948 after approval.

Editorial

### Analysis of the US Aid to China Problem

After heated discussions in both the US Senate and House of Representatives, the US Emergency Aid Act was finally agreed upon, and aid to China was still included in the bill. Although opinions on aid to China varied greatly within the US government and public, after a month of discussion in both houses, opinions can be said to have become consistent. Moreover, this bill has already been signed into law by President Truman, and aid to Europe and aid to China are considered equally important, with no distinction made between them. Logically, there should be no more problems. Unexpectedly, another snag arose, with the House Appropriations Committee actually proposing to cut the foreign aid fund by $88 million, including $60 million for China. When we heard this news the day before yesterday, we did not pay much attention to the Appropriations Committee's obstruction and believed that this proposal would definitely be rejected by the House of Representatives. However, according to a dispatch from the United Press in Washington on the 17th, the House of Representatives has passed the Appropriations Committee's cut and has sent it to the Senate for discussion. The House of Representatives' inconsistency is truly perplexing. The US aid to China problem can be described as full of twists and turns, leaving those of us who are most concerned about the US political situation feeling lost in a fog.

President Truman convened Congress this time primarily for the emergency aid to Europe issue. Even in President Truman's message to Congress, there was not a word about aid to China. However, Republican leaders and members of Congress who generally sympathize with China expressed dissatisfaction that President Truman's emergency foreign aid plan did not include China, and criticized President Truman for prioritizing Europe over Asia. The House Foreign Affairs Committee first proposed that the US should allocate $60 million to aid China within the foreign aid fund. Through the efforts of Congressman Judd, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed it. At the same time, twelve American diplomats jointly appealed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for military and economic assistance to China. The American media also unanimously advocated that the US should immediately provide comprehensive assistance to China. However, the Senate passed a $59.7 million aid to Europe bill on December 1st without making any major revisions. Therefore, there were two foreign aid bills in the US Congress: one was the foreign aid bill proposed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which included $60 million in aid to China, and was later passed by the House of Representatives on the 10th; the other was the emergency foreign aid bill passed by the Senate, which was similar to that proposed by President Truman and did not include China in the bill. According to American political practice, when the Senate and House of Representatives disagree on a certain bill, a joint conference of the Senate and House of Representatives must be held to negotiate a compromise bill. The first joint conference was held on the 12th of this month, but no agreement was reached due to differing opinions. However, a compromise was finally reached: China was listed as one of the four recipient countries in the emergency foreign aid bill; the total amount of the foreign aid fund remained $59.7 million; the amounts to be received by China, France, Italy, and Austria were not specified, but were to be determined by the Appropriations Committee. As a result, this compromise bill was passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives on the 15th.

We studied this compromise bill. On the surface, China has been listed as one of the four recipient countries, but in reality, it may not receive any assistance. Because there is an attached condition in this compromise bill: "Any funds reserved for aid to China may be used to aid the other three countries." Therefore, when China will receive emergency aid from the US depends on when the State Department submits its specific aid to China plan. From this, it can be said that the House Appropriations Committee's proposal to cut aid to China is no accident. Moreover, some people say that the emergency foreign aid bill cannot be viewed solely from the perspective of international politics, but also needs to take into account the US domestic economic situation, and should be jointly decided by the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Appropriations Committee. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Appropriations Committee's proposal is based on a narrow American economic perspective. However, the House of Representatives' inconsistency is the strangest thing in the world! After passing the House of Representatives, the cut is now submitted to the Senate for discussion. Yesterday, the Associated Press and United Press reports on the question of whether the US will aid China were overwhelming, some repeating each other, and some contradicting each other, extremely complex. We summarized them into the following points: The House of Representatives has passed the cut proposed by the Appropriations Committee; General Wedemeyer, who attacked the Chinese government for "corruption and incompetence," appealed to the Senate Appropriations Committee, arguing that the US should provide economic and military assistance to China, and praised President Chiang's leadership of the Chinese military and people in the war of resistance against Japan; State Department Assistant Thorpe announced that the State Department has drafted a long-term aid to China plan, which will be implemented as soon as funding is available, and said that the US supply of food and kerosene to China is also part of the US aid to China plan; Liddell, the original author of the "Visit China" article that caused a sensation in the world, spoke again at a committee in the Senate, reiterating that the US should send MacArthur to China, and if MacArthur cannot spare the time, then General Clark should be sent to China.

From these reports, we can see the chaos in the United States. Not only is the US government hesitant about China, but opinions in the media are still divided. Perhaps this chaotic phenomenon is the characteristic of American democracy, but we must point out that the US government and public still do not have a correct understanding of the current situation in the Far East and the political situation in China. The average American not only does not know what the Chinese Communist Party is, but also does not know how to raise their vigilance against the establishment of the Far Eastern Communist International in order to prevent problems before they arise. To be honest, international relations have developed to the current stage, and world peace is already indivisible. After World War I, there were still so-called isolationists in the US. Later, facts proved that even if the US wanted to stay out of it, it was impossible. Therefore, after World War II, isolationists had long disappeared, but the concept of "Europe First" was still deeply rooted and unbreakable. If the US government's foreign policy does not break through this stale old concept, it will inevitably lead to unpredictable disasters in the future. The US should attach equal importance to Europe and Asia, and especially should actively aid China. We do not want to waste any more words, but hope that the US government and public will quickly make wise decisions regarding the current world situation, and should pay attention to the unity of foreign policy. This ambiguous and contradictory attitude is harmful to both world peace and the interests of the US itself.

### Opinions on Increasing Paper Production

(Continued from page one) The planned paper production for the next year is 112,320 tons of paper, 73,500 tons of cardboard, and 180 tons of cigarette paper, which is an increase of 46,223 tons of paper, 21,655 tons of cardboard, and 90 tons of cigarette paper compared to this year's production. In order to achieve the above needs, the quantity of imported wood pulp is as follows: A. For factories manufacturing adhesive paper, based on 42% supply of wood pulp, 41,715 tons are needed. B. For cardboard factories, based on 10% supply of wood pulp, 6,750 tons are needed. C. For cigarette paper factories, based on 10% supply of wood pulp, 18 tons are needed, totaling 48,483 tons of wood pulp. The amount of newspaper production increase in the next year is as follows: (Each factory converts 50% of the increased production into newspaper paper) A. Thin paper factories can produce 24,612 tons of newspaper paper. B. Cardboard factories can produce 10,828 tons of newspaper paper. C. Cigarette paper factories can produce 45 tons of newspaper paper, totaling 35,485 tons. Regarding self-made pulp, A. The Tainan Paper Mill of the National Resources Commission should find ways to increase production, and be able to reach a daily output of 60 tons after four months. B. The Zhongyuan Paper Mill has already imported six mechanical pulp tanks. Except for one that has been shipped to Sichuan, the remaining five should be assisted in establishing a mechanical pulp mill in Taiwan, with a daily output of 50 tons. C. The equipment of the China Paper Mill should be supplemented and its expansion should be assisted, so that the production site can be increased from 10 tons to 50 tons per day. D. Assist private paper mills in various regions to cooperate in setting up chemical wood pulp machinery, wood pulp and grass pulp factories in various regions. The above projects will be completed within three to four years. Regarding materials; A. Copper wire mesh, each ton of thin paper consumes 2 square feet of copper wire, each ton of cardboard consumes 0.25 square feet of copper wire mesh, and each ton of cigarette paper consumes 4 square feet of copper wire mesh. B. Blankets, each ton of thin paper uses 1.3 pounds of grade A blankets, each ton of cardboard uses 1.2 pounds of secondary blankets, and each ton of cigarette paper uses 1.73 pounds of blankets. C. Canvas, each ton of thin paper uses 1 pound of canvas. These materials, together with the coal, bleaching powder, sulfur, etc. required for papermaking, should be jointly organized by state-owned and private paper mills into a papermaking materials supply committee, which will be responsible for the overall distribution. For those that must be imported, the import quantity for each quarter should be agreed upon with the Import and Export Management Committee to avoid shortages. Next year, the import of wood-free paper, glazed paper, packaging paper, cardboard, etc., except for cellophane, drawing paper, and model cardboard (approximately US$2 million), will be completely prohibited. The import volume of cigarette paper should be reduced from 600,000 reams to 390,000 reams. The amount of newspaper imports should be reduced from 50,000 tons to 15,000 tons. The amount of wood pulp imports should be increased from 12,000 tons to 48,483 tons. The required foreign exchange is A. Newspaper 15,000 tons, estimated at US$167 per ton, totaling US$2.50 million. B. Cigarette paper 390,000 reams, US$5 per ream, totaling US$1.95 million. C. Wood pulp 48,483 tons, US$200 per ton, totaling US$9.696.6-00 million, for a total of US$14.146,1600 million, a decrease of approximately US$4 million compared to this year's imports. Although paper production has increased by more than 50,000 tons, the supply and demand situation for newspapers can barely be met, cardboard can also be self-sufficient, but other types of paper are still insufficient, and efforts should be made to conserve consumption to match supply and demand. The distribution price of newspapers is very different from the market price and adjustments should be made to make it reasonable.

### Three War Criminals, Including the Devil Who Killed People, Tried in One Court and Sentenced to Death

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Noda Tsuyoshi and Mukai Toshiaki, the two war criminals who participated in the Nanjing Massacre's killing contest, and Tanaka Gunkichi, who killed 300 people, have been sentenced to death. The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense held a public trial of the case today in the auditorium of the Lizhi Society, presided over by Shi Meiyu. After the three criminals were brought to court, they were asked to state their age and origin. Prosecutor Li Xuan then presented the main points of the indictment and began individual investigations. First, Tanaka was questioned. According to his confession, he was under the command of Tani Hisao and participated in the attack on Nanjing in December 1937. The court presented the criminal with a wooden figure of Tanaka killing my civilians and a photo of his military sword, which he used to kill more than 300 people. Tanaka admitted that he "did use this sword to fight," but cunningly claimed that the killing photo was taken during combat in Tongcheng, Hubei, when he was ordered to kill a person who had been executed. The presiding judge then presented the book "Imperial Soldiers" written by Japanese officer Yamanaka Taro, which contained text and photos of Tanaka using this precious sword to slaughter more than 300 people. When the criminal saw this evidence, he again evaded responsibility, claiming that the author had fabricated it to show the special bravery of the imperial army. Subsequently, Mukai and Noda were questioned. According to telegrams sent by enemy war correspondents Asami Hikari and Asami Suzuki, which were continuously published in Tokyo newspapers, the two criminals participated in a killing contest during the Nanjing siege on December 12, 1937, racing to create a record of 150 kills in Zijinshan. As a result, Mukai killed 106 people and Noda killed 105 people, as verified by the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun. The book "The Nanjing Massacre" written by British journalist Timperley also contains the same record, which can be used as corroborating evidence. However, the two war criminals falsely claimed that the news reporters had fabricated the story. Mukai said that when he met a news reporter after fighting in Wuxi, he jokingly said that the reporter had fabricated this heroic deed to exaggerate his martial prowess and encourage public morale. The debate then began, and all were refuted one by one in court. After deliberation by the five judges, the court continued to convene, and the presiding judge first rejected the requests from the criminals to continue investigating the evidence, and then announced the following main text of the judgment in court: "[Tanaka Gunkichi, Noda Tsuyoshi, and Mukai Toshiaki, during the war, continuously slaughtered prisoners and non-combatants, and are each sentenced to death." The presiding judge explained the main points of the reasons for the judgment. Tani Hisao invaded Nanjing in December 1937 and carried out a massacre, which was a major stain on the history of world civilization. China suffered 300,000 casualties. The judgment of the case has been recognized by the world as their crime. All of Tani Hisao's subordinates who participated in the massacre are accomplices, unless they can provide special evidence to the contrary. Not only could the three criminals not provide evidence to the contrary, but there was conclusive evidence proving their participation. Tanaka admitted to being a subordinate of Tani and recognized the precious sword as his own. Noda and Mukai admitted to belonging to Nakajima's unit, which was also attacking Nanjing. The evidence of each crime is conclusive, and the judgment is based on the law as above. However, the judgment must be submitted to our Supreme Commander for approval. If the defendants are not satisfied, they may submit a statement of defense within ten days after receiving the judgment. After the translator finished, the presiding judge announced the adjournment of the court at 2:30 p.m., and the defendants were returned to custody.

[Another telegram] Takahashi Taka, former military attache of the Japanese Embassy in China, was publicly tried at 4 p.m. on the 18th by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense at the Lizhi Society.

### Wedemeyer Strongly Urges Aid to China, Political Circles in Nanjing Attach Great Importance, Believing That the Outline of His Secret Recommendations Can Be Seen

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 18th] Wedemeyer strongly argued for the necessity of aiding China in the Appropriations Committee of the Senate in Washington. The National Government here believes that this is the most exciting development in American aid since the victory. The basis of the government's attitude is that Wedemeyer's views expressed in the Senate Committee are undoubtedly the same as the recommendations in his secret report, and Wedemeyer's report has a decisive influence on the formation of the State Department's China policy.

On the day of his departure from China, Wedemeyer issued a statement severely criticizing the Chinese government, and several senior officials of the Chinese government refuted his inadequate observations. Wedemeyer's remarks in the Senate Committee, for the first time, revealed his views on China's policy, and some aspects were surprisingly lenient. Unofficial news reports once claimed that Truman and Marshall had approved Wedemeyer's report on aid to China, but before finding a good strategy for proposing the aid plan, Wedemeyer's report was shelved and not made public. Now, this news seems quite reasonable. It is believed here that the reason why the US government has been slow to publish the report is to first resolve the urgent European recovery plan and the London Foreign Ministers Conference.

Well-informed sources believe that the State Department has another factor in not immediately publishing the report. It is believed that the United States is adopting Wedemeyer's strategy: If the Chinese government cannot obtain US action, then the government has a greater chance of self-reliance by calling on Wedemeyer, thereby making China more worthy of assistance.

Howard Expresses Opinion that the US Should Immediately Help China Train Troops

[Associated Press, Pearl Harbor, 18th] Major General Howard of the US Marine Corps, who recently served as Commander of the Marine Corps in China, expressed his opinion on the 18th, agreeing with General Wedemeyer's remarks, believing that the United States should immediately train and equip at least fifteen divisions of the National Army. Howard said: Unless this is done, before the end of the spring of next year, the Communist Party will seize the entire Northeast. He believes that Soviet aid to the CCP "has been going on for a long time. If we had taken prompt action, the situation of the National Army would not be as bad as it is now. I believe that Chairman Chiang's removal of incompetent officials in the past six months has obviously achieved a lot." Howard was captured by the Japanese during the war and is now the commander of the Pacific Marine Corps.

Butterworth Answers Questions About Soviet and CCP Supplies; Coulborn Suggests Ways to Aid China

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far East Division of the State Department, stated today in the Senate Appropriations Committee in response to Chairman Bridges' question about the Soviet Union's aid to the CCP: "I believe the Soviet Union is helping the CCP obtain supplies, as well as Japanese weapons and ammunition, but this cannot be verified." Congressman Judd stated: "Everyone in China knows that the Soviet Union is helping the CCP." Kenneth Coulborn, Vice President of the American China Policy Association, also testified, criticizing the policy adopted by the United States, which is intended to deliberately undermine the Chinese government. He also suggested four points as follows:

Appropriate a considerable amount of funds within the emergency foreign aid bill to aid China.

Immediately donate surplus weapons and ammunition to China.

Supply China with weapons, ammunition, and necessary supplies.

Immediately dismiss all State Department personnel who have sympathy for the CCP or the Soviet Union.

### Economic Merger of German Occupation Zones: US and Britain Sign New Agreement, US Bears Three-Fourths of All Expenses and Obtains Greater Control Over German Trade

[Reuters, London, 17th] The new agreement amending the Anglo-American agreement on the merger of the British and American zones in Germany was simultaneously announced in London and Washington on the 17th. The content stipulates that the United States will bear all imports purchased in US dollars needed by the Anglo-American zone, and the United States will also bear three-quarters of all expenditures in the Anglo-American occupation zone. Britain agreed to supply and pay for all necessary imports purchased from the sterling area, and control over German import and export policies will be proportionally shared by Britain and the United States based on the amount of expenses borne. This agreement, the result of negotiations between the two governments for more than ten weeks, will make western Germany virtually a hard currency country and will force Britain to increase exports to Germany from the sterling area other than food to pay for timber and other goods obtained from Germany. Under this agreement, Britain can be exempted from the obligation to offset Germany's trade deficit with US dollars, which is estimated to be about 50 million to 60 million pounds this year. The United States' acquisition of greater control over German import and export policies and foreign exchange funds was also recognized by Britain as fair, as the United States has already generously agreed to bear all US dollar expenses. The official communiqué also solemnly stated that except for changes in the control of import and export policies and foreign exchange funds, the control over the economic, political, or military policies of the merged zone will still be implemented according to the current system, that is, the system in which Britain and the United States each bear half. The US dollar expenses that the United States will have to increase in accordance with this agreement are estimated to reach 400 million next year. The agreement also stipulates that the US government, in view of Britain's serious US dollar difficulties, agrees to adjust the activities of the Anglo-American zone import and export agencies as much as possible so that the sterling that Britain needs to accept in 1948 is limited to no more than US$40 million. If the acceptance makes Britain's US dollar resources unbearable, the British government may still raise this issue in the Anglo-American Joint Committee, and if necessary, the two governments may engage in discussions to seek measures to reduce acceptance that are acceptable to the US government. The agreement stipulates that the British government will pay materials or money worth 8.5 million pounds (equivalent to 34 million US dollars) to cover the expenses from November 1, 1947, to December 31. In 1948, Britain should import materials worth 17.5 million pounds (equivalent to 70 million US dollars) from the sterling area to the Anglo-American zone in Germany, and also deposit 4.25 million pounds (equivalent to 17 million US dollars) for the import of materials from the sterling area when necessary. In addition, the British government must allocate 33 ships to transport materials from the United States to Germany from November to December of this year. In 1948, the British government should be responsible for transporting twelve ships of materials from US ports to Germany every month. This agreement does not take into account the maintenance costs of the occupation forces and German employees. If these expenses are included, the ratio of expenses shared by Britain and the United States in the merged zone is approximately one to three.

In order to deal with this threat, the Jewish state must maintain at least 10,000 troops, and initially allocate US$500,000 per week for military expenses.

[United Press International, New York, 17th] The "Third Party" movement supporting Wallace for President shows signs of division today. This political organization may lose all its political clout.

### Austin Discusses Policy Towards the Soviet Union; Emphasizes a Pincer Movement, Combining Economic Aid and Strengthening National Defense

[Reuters, Chicago, 17th] U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Austin stated in a speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations today that the U.S. response to the Soviet Union's policies is to seek peace through a pincer movement. On the one hand, we must use economic power to help free nations maintain their freedom, confidence, and strength. On the other hand, we will maintain our strong defense capabilities, sufficient to deter anyone who attempts to threaten peace anywhere. The current state of tension in the world is mainly due to the Soviet Union's unwillingness to establish a collective security agreement with Britain and the United States. If the aforementioned pincer movement succeeds, it is believed that the Communist parties outside the Soviet Union will disintegrate, and the economic isolation of Eastern Europe is not what its people desire.

### Newly Revised Business Tax Rate Slightly Changed

[Report from our newspaper] The Finance Bureau stated that as the old and new business tax rates were slightly different, many merchants were unclear about the applicable situation. Therefore, they issued a public announcement yesterday stating: After the implementation of the newly revised Business Tax Law in this city, the tax rates have been changed to mandatory provisions. Those who use business revenue as the standard for taxation will be charged 1.5 percent, and those who use business income as the standard for taxation will be charged 4 percent. Previously, pawnshops were taxed based on capital, and brokerage firms were taxed based on commissions. Now, they are all taxed based on income, and the method of calculating taxes on an annual basis has been abolished. The so-called income amount is already explained in the appendix of the newly implemented detailed rules, that is, the commissions and handling fees of brokerage firms and agency firms, the interest income of pawnshops, and the warehouse rent of warehouses all belong to it. Previously, brokerage firms were taxed at 3 percent, but after the implementation of the new law, it has been changed to 4 percent. The bureau's taxation method is that the business tax to be collected before the summer of the 36th year is all handled according to the old law, and the business tax to be collected after the autumn is changed to be handled according to the new law. Recently, when receiving the business tax returns for this autumn from merchants, it was found that some pawnshops still filled in the capital amount, and some brokerage firms mistakenly believed that the 4 percent tax rate was a miscalculation by the bureau and requested correction, all of which were caused by a lack of understanding of the tax law. As for when the central government's recent revision of the tax rate, which changed the tax rate to 3 percent for those who use income as the standard for taxation and 6 percent for those who use income as the standard for taxation, should be implemented, it is still under consideration.

According to the Finance Bureau: The new slaughter tax rate has been increased to 10 percent.

### Trial of Vigilante Murder Case Concluded; Police Bureau Chief and Sauce Garden Owner Listed as Defendants; Lawyer States Reasons, Believes It Is Not in Accordance with the Law

[Report from our newspaper] The case of Gu Weijun, a vigilante from Xujiahui, who was charged with shooting and killing Wang Wanshun, owner of Shunxingran Workshop, was concluded by the District Court yesterday, and sentencing is scheduled for the 25th. After presiding Judge Zhu Nianci took his seat, he brought the detained Gu Weijun to court. Wang Zhenxiong, son of the victim, Tang, a patrol officer representing the Xujiahui Police Station, and Zhou Hongda and Zhou, two lawyers representing the defendants in the civil suit, were all present in court to make statements. Yu Shuping, Director of the Beiping Police Bureau, and the owner of Wan Shen Sauce Garden, were not present. According to the vigilante Gu Weijun, he did fire a gun, but he denied shooting Wang Wanshun. Patrol Officer Tang briefly described the situation at the time of the incident. Then, the defendant's lawyer stood up and stated that he opposed the plaintiff's listing of the police bureau chief and the Wan Shen Sauce Garden owner as defendants, stating that Gu Weijun was a vigilante and there was no employment relationship with the police bureau, and that vigilantes were unpaid, which was not in accordance with the provisions of Article 188 of the Civil Code. As for Gu Weijun's service at Wan Shen Sauce Garden, there was no fault in his work at the sauce garden, and the sauce garden could not be held responsible for his actions while serving as a vigilante outside. Therefore, the plaintiff's listing of the police bureau chief and the sauce garden owner as defendants and requesting compensation for losses was not in accordance with the law and should be rejected. After the debate, the court ordered that the case be sentenced on a certain date, Gu Weijun was returned to detention, and the rest were ordered to leave.

### Closing Declaration of the Postal Workers' Congress

The Fifth National Postal Workers' Congress successfully concluded on the 17th. The congress also issued a declaration, which stated in brief: In June of this year, the newly promulgated "Trade Union Law" clearly stipulates that trade unions in various industries may have national organizations. Therefore, this Congress resolved to change the name of this organization, "National Postal Workers' General Union," to "National Federation of Postal Workers' Unions of the Republic of China" in accordance with the law. From this point forward, this organization will have legal protection, and the attainment of legal status will be completed. However, there is still no international organization for postal workers worldwide. In order to connect international postal workers and promote world peace, the organization of an international postal workers' union is one of the goals that we should strive for in the future. We postal workers have always regarded enlightening the labor movement as our mission. In the future, we should go a step further to promote the establishment of the "National Confederation of Trade Unions of the Republic of China," hoping to concentrate the will and power of workers across the country, assist in the advancement of democratic constitutionalism, and promote the realization of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. This is the second goal that we should strive for. Local postal workers are the actual implementers of postal work. The opinions they express based on their work experience are valuable. We sincerely hope that the postal authorities will convene a national postal conference in the near future to accept the opinions of all parties in this organization in order to seek the revitalization and improvement of the postal service. This is the third goal that we should strive for. At present, the postal authorities do not pay enough attention to the welfare of postal workers. There is no provision of dormitories and canteens, and the cooperative organizations are short of funds, existing in name only. The reduction of salaries and allowances has made the lives of postal workers increasingly difficult. Therefore, we urge the postal authorities to develop welfare programs, issue salaries and allowances based on the actual cost of living index, and maintain reasonable treatment for postal workers. This is the fourth goal that we should strive for.

### Middle-Aged Woman Stabbed Twenty-Eight Times: Truth Revealed in Murder Case by the Creek in Song Park Road; Heartless Godson Ultimately Captured for Attacking After Loan Request Denied

[Report from this newspaper] On the morning of the 3rd of this month, the body of a murdered middle-aged woman was found by the creek near the Mingqiang Middle School in the Xiangyi Port of Zhabei Song Park Road. The body had a total of twenty-eight stab wounds, and the death was quite tragic. The Criminal Division of the Municipal Police Bureau and the Dachang Police Sub-bureau, which has jurisdiction over the area, attached great importance to the shocking murder case. Section Chief Li personally led Zhu Mengxian, head of the first unit, staff members Chen Xianrong, Ma Feimu, Police Chief He Yaozu, and Zhang Youquan, director of the Dachang Police Sub-bureau, He Peiji, head of the judicial section, and Liu Zichang, staff member, to conduct the investigation. After three days, they learned that the deceased was Zhang Songshi, 48 years old, from Shaoxing, and the murderer was her godson, Li Zhongjian (also known as A Su), 26 years old, a worker at the Yang Rongji sock factory at No. 12 Beile Lane, South Huangpi Road. After investigating the motive for the murder, it was found that it was due to the failure of a loan request.

Hatred Arises

The deceased used to live in the countryside, but recently, due to financial difficulties, she wrote to Jin Yunfa, a fellow villager at No. 6 Xiafu Lane, Gonghe New Road in Shanghai, in early November, asking him to find a house for her, intending to come to Shanghai to open a small shop. Two weeks later, she received a reply saying that the house had been found and asked her to come to Shanghai. At that time, the murderer, Li Zhongjian, returned to his hometown from Shanghai, and the deceased invited him to come to Shanghai together. He arrived in Shanghai on November 23 and temporarily stayed at the home of Li's fiancée, Zhang Jieying, from Hangzhou, at No. 93 Dakang Lane, Shunchang Road. However, the deceased had feelings for Li, because the deceased also had a daughter named Meizhu

Dissatisfaction with the Betrothal

, who was originally intended to be betrothed to Xing Li. Now that she saw that the good thing was not going to happen, she took the opportunity to use her identity as a godmother to insult and scold Li from time to time. Later, she learned that Li and Miss Zhang were about to get married, and she became disheartened. Li was still unaware of the situation and even asked the deceased to lend him 5 million yuan for wedding expenses, but was rejected. At that time, Li harbored hatred in his heart and quietly left Shanghai for his hometown at the end of last month. He went to the house of Zhang Arui, the deceased's son, in Taoli Yaojialou, falsely claiming that his mother had found a house in Shanghai, but it would cost 13 million yuan,

Exposing the Scam

Zhang gathered the cash and asked to come to Shanghai with him. When his mother saw him, Li was scolded by the deceased on the spot. That night, Zhang stayed at the house of Jin Lianfa, a fellow villager at No. 6 Fuchang Lane, Gonghe New Road, while the deceased still stayed at Li's fiancée's house. However, the mother and son had agreed to meet at the North Station at 2:00 PM on the 2nd of this month and return to their hometown together. Unexpectedly, when the deceased arrived at the station, they did not meet because of the crowd, and Li hurriedly arrived and saw Zhang still lingering at the station. He made an excuse saying that his son was still on Gonghe New Road and accompanied her there. At that time, Li already harbored murderous intentions and had purchased

A Cleaver

at the Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 469 Haining Road. When they reached a deserted area of Song Park Road, he pulled out the cleaver and slashed the deceased's head, face, hands, and feet twenty-eight times, causing her to die on the spot due to serious injuries. He then took off the gold ring she was wearing and fled after discarding the knife. On the 6th of this month, Li learned that detectives were pursuing him and left Shanghai to Feng A Da's house at Yuehai Bridge on Fuxing Road on the Qiantang River. However, the net of justice is vast, and he was finally captured by police on the night of the 15th of this month and escorted to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Li confessed to the murder, and the police station will transfer him to the district prosecutor's office for interrogation.

### Whispers of Wind, Initial Flurries of Auspicious Snow

[Report from this newspaper] The mystery of whether it would snow this winter was revealed yesterday. Flurries of white snow, interspersed with sharp winds and fine rain, fell over the city all day long. Zheng Zizheng, the director of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, predicted to this newspaper on the 12th of this month, and it has now been fully verified. Zheng based his prediction on the fact that the humidity along the coast was very high, and the cold air from the northern high pressure system was moving and would reach Central China this week and encounter the humid air, so he expected that it might snow. This Siberian anticyclone has now truly blanketed the country, with its center in the Mongolia-Xinjiang area. Nanjing, Jiujiang, Hangzhou and other places in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have also been snowing, and the temperature has dropped sharply, with most areas above Nanjing and below Yichang being below 0 degrees Celsius. The highest temperature in the city yesterday was 38.4 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest was 34 degrees Fahrenheit, equivalent to just over 1 degree Celsius. It is predicted that it will be cloudy today, and there will still be intermittent snow flurries, but they will gradually stop, and it will be sunny tomorrow. The weather forecast is recorded below:

Yellow Sea: Sunny and freezing, gentle north to west winds, medium waves. Central China: Cloudy, colder, local snowfall or sleet, gentle north winds, fog at night. Shanghai: Cloudy, intermittent snow and freezing to mild, light fog at night, local snowfall in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, strong north to northwest winds. East China Sea: Cloudy, rain along the coast, strong north to northeast winds, even stronger winds in the Taiwan Strait, giant waves, even larger waves around Taiwan. Minimum temperature 34 degrees Fahrenheit

### Sharp Drop in Water Levels in the Yangtze and Tianjin Rivers, Vessels Add Shallow Water Fees

[Report from this newspaper] Since the beginning of winter, the water level of the Yangtze River has dropped sharply, and the channel between Tianjin and Tanggu on the Northern route has also gradually decreased. According to shipping industry news: yesterday, the water level of the East River was only 9 feet 5 inches, and ships with a draft of more than 10 feet could not sail. The water level of Tanggu was only 15 feet 5 inches, and all ships could not load as much cargo as possible, resulting in great losses. The Tianjin Navigation Administration has stipulated that from the 10th of this month to the end of February next year, a shallow water fee of 130% will be added, a lighterage fee of 30%, and a pilotage fee of 30%. In the Shanghai-Hankou section of the Yangtze River, a shallow water fee of 20% will be added, and in the Hankou-Yichang and Hankou-Chongqing sections, 30% will be added, to be implemented next Monday.

### "Wan Fushi" Ship Robbed in Hong Kong

[Report from our correspondent in Hong Kong, 16th] When the news that the "Wan Fushi" ocean liner of the Java Shipping Company had been robbed reached Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 15th, many citizens were "skeptical" because it was an ocean liner of more than 4,000 tons, not a vessel that traveled on inland rivers. In recent months, the inland rivers of Guangdong have been unstable, and even ships traveling between Guangdong and Hong Kong have repeatedly been subjected to the "hit list" by bandits or even the laying of water mines, but the "Wan Fushi" is the first ocean liner to be robbed after the war.

The "Wan Fushi" sailed from Singapore to Shantou and stopped in Hong Kong for a very short time, taking on less than ten passengers, and several of them were later kidnapped by the bandits. Therefore, people in the shipping company believe that the more than twenty pirates boarded the ship as early as in Singapore, which shows that those

The pirates had planned this attack very carefully. Of the more than twenty pirates, the two leaders were familiar faces, and most of them spoke with a Guangzhou accent. The incident occurred at Mashi Bay, fifty nautical miles from Hong Kong, close to the communist-controlled Haifeng and Lufeng coasts. Most of the local people speak Chaozhou dialect, so some of the pirates also spoke Chaozhou dialect. Mashi Bay (i.e., Dapeng Bay) has long been an area where Guangdong pirates operate, and before the war, British warships often patrolled nearby. Half a year ago, the sinking of the "Qing" ship in a storm also occurred in the nearby waters. The pirates stormed into the captain's cabin, seized the captain and his assistant, and then

Searched and Robbed for Fifteen Hours

on the ship. Under the threat of the pirates' guns, the captain and crew could not resist, so there was no bloodshed throughout the entire process. However, when the pirates succeeded and escaped by boat, they forcibly kidnapped six passengers. Among them were Chen Boxuan, director of the Shantou Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, Chen Jiechang, son of Chen Jiageng, and Bai Qifu, president of the Shantou City Bank. Their relatives who remained on the ship witnessed them being forced away, weeping sadly, and all the passengers on the ship could not help but feel a sense of sorrow. The pirates had already obtained property, but they still kidnapped people to extort money, which is rare in similar incidents.

The passengers with the greatest losses

were in first class. It is said that the value of the property lost was over one million Singapore dollars, as well as gold jewelry, watches, etc., filling a large wooden plate. There were a total of 71 first and second class passengers, more than 1,500 steerage passengers, and 129 crew members on board. The ship's self-defense weapons were also taken away. After the pirates succeeded in their robbery, one account said that three sailing boats came to meet them and return to shore, while another account said that the pirates fired their guns on the ship to threaten nearby fishing boats to come and pick them up. It is not yet possible to verify which account is true.

After being robbed, the "Wan Fushi" sailed back to Hong Kong to report the case and will only sail to Shantou this afternoon. (Special Correspondent Zi Jian)

[Report from our correspondent in Wujin, 17th] The Jiangsu Department of Finance is earnestly sorting out the finances of various counties and cities to cooperate with the suppression of the rebellion and has ordered the implementation of measures for compliance.

### Gold and Silver Discovered in the Jiangdong Yangyin Township Treasury

[Report from our correspondent in Jiangyin, 17th] In the Yangyin Model Town in eastern Jiangyin, in the middle section of Miaohong, there is a large house. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Zhaoxing Pawnshop was opened there. When it fell into enemy hands in 1937, the pawnbroker in charge of the pawnshop secretly hid a large amount of pawned gold and silver jewelry in batches. During the 1940s, a portion of the jewelry was excavated by He's unit of the New Fourth Army, but the exact amount is unknown. This autumn, the town mayor, Xia Yizhi, opened a village hospital in the house and actively arranged it. A few days ago (13th), workers were hired to dredge the well, and wooden stones and iron bars were found at the bottom of the well. Below them, 24 copper footstoves were excavated, containing gold and silver jewelry and rings, etc. According to weighing, there were 8 market catties of gold jewelry and more than 30 catties of silver jewelry. There has been no detailed count of diamond rings and jewelry, but outside rumors say that there are more than 100 catties of gold and silver, which is probably unreliable. After the gold and silver were excavated, the entire town was shaken. Town Mayor Xia and local people verified and inspected the items and temporarily kept them under the town mayor's custody. In the future, after they are sold, it is planned to build the Victory Bridge and a small vegetable market, as well as various local public welfare projects for the construction of the village hospital. After County Magistrate Xu heard about the matter, he said that the handling method still needs to be handled carefully to avoid disputes.

Jin Yan and Qin Yi Get Married in Hong Kong, Guo Moruo's Speech Backfires

[Report from our correspondent in Hong Kong, 16th] Film stars Jin Yan and Qin Yi got married in Hong Kong on the 15th. Guo Moruo, who officiated the wedding and delivered a speech, said a few words to the effect that "Hong Kong can be regarded as a desert area in terms of culture and art," which aroused the resentment of cultural circles in Hong Kong. This was Guo Moruo's first public appearance and speech after fleeing to Hong Kong, but unexpectedly, it "backfired!" The meaning of Guo's words seemed to be that any cultural and artistic field without Guo or Guo's hangers-on is a "desert area," which is nonsense! On that day, Qin Yi wore a newly made purple velvet cheongsam. She said: "It's the first time I've worn it, and it's a lot of suffering." Jin Yan wore a well-tailored suit with broad shoulders. After helping his new wife put on a dyed red flower, he asked: "Does it look good?" (Special Delegate Zi Jian)

[Report from our correspondent in Wuxi, 17th] Pang Mianmian, a woman from Lang Yixi, Anhui, in view of the central government's call for young people to enlist in the army, and for the sake of the country's survival and her personal future, resolutely came to Wuxi a month ago and went to the local regimental management area to participate in the enlistment of young people, requesting permission to join the army.

### The Mayor's First Education Inspection: Accompanied by Li Ximou, He Departed in the Snow Yesterday Morning; Praised the Good Teaching Situation at the Women's Normal School

[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu has always been extremely concerned about education in the city. Previously, due to busy political affairs, he was unable to personally inspect the schools. He recently decided to take time to visit the city's primary and secondary schools, making this his first education inspection since taking office. Yesterday morning at 8:35 AM, as the first snow fell, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau Li Ximou arrived at the mayor's residence to wait for him. At 8:40 AM, they set off together in the snow. They first went to the Municipal Women's Normal School on Yuyuan Road, where they were accompanied on a tour of the entire school by Principal Chen Heqin, Director of the Normal Department Yang Zhiguang, and teachers from the specialized department, including Jing Xiaodan. The school's site was originally the Girls' Department of the Shanghai West School of the Public Concession before the war. During the Pacific War, Bai Xue served as a military camp. After the victory, the Education Bureau established the Municipal Women's Normal School here, with departments for normal education, specialized studies, elementary school, and kindergarten. There are currently over 1,000 students. Due to the limited school buildings, the specialized studies department and others hold classes in temporary housing. Some of the school staff's dormitories and restrooms are located in tents. Mayor Wu and Deputy Director Li inspected each classroom and carefully read the students' assignments and wall newspapers. The mayor was very interested in the school's implementation of "living education." Later, the mayor braved the snow to survey the vacant land behind the school. Because there are still over 8,000 out-of-school children of school age in Jing'an District, which the school cannot accommodate due to space constraints, the school plans to add buildings. There is an area of over four mu of vacant land behind the school that is suitable for this purpose. In the future, the Education Bureau plans to allocate 100 million yuan, and the District Office will raise 200 million yuan to cover construction costs. After inspecting the site, the mayor inquired about the landlord to discuss purchasing or leasing the land for building. After the inspection, the mayor, at the school's request, gave a speech in the auditorium to the assembled 1,000 teachers and students. First, he expressed his impression after the visit, stating that he believed that the teachers' teaching and the students' learning were both quite good. This was due to the fact that Principal Chen is a renowned education expert and relied on the efforts of the faculty and staff to achieve these results, which he was very pleased with.

Encouragement on How to Be a Person

The mayor then offered two points of encouragement: Have confidence in yourself: Dr. Yan Yingqing recently told me that he had recently read two books. One, written by an Englishman, praised six great men in the world who have contributed to social culture and thought. The other, written by an American, praised eight great men. But what they had in common was that both the six and the eight included China's Confucius and Lao Tzu. Therefore, Chinese people should not abandon themselves and simply praise foreigners. Chinese people themselves also have excellent creative abilities. Education not only teaches people knowledge, but should also teach them how to be a person: Although Confucius's Analects and Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching were written over two thousand years apart, the principles they describe are still true today. The current high prices and accumulation of material desires are fundamentally due to the fact that the Chinese people have completely abandoned or destroyed their inherent academic and moral foundations, and what they have learned from Europe and the United States is only superficial. If the Chinese people can all keep the European and American sense of responsibility (Duty), honesty (Honest), sportsmanship (Sportsmanship), and the Chinese inherent virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness in mind and practice them, then China will surely become a strong and excellent country. Graduates of normal schools, when teaching people in the future, must not only teach knowledge, but also teach them how to be a person.

Mayor Wu and Deputy Director Li then went to the adjacent West Municipal Middle School, where they were led by Principal Zhao Chuanjia to visit the chemistry, physics, and biology laboratories, the library, and the classrooms. On the blackboard in the Class A classroom of the third year of high school, there were words written in white chalk welcoming the democratic Mayor Wu and wishing Mayor Wu a long life in both Chinese and English. The mayor made no comment upon seeing this. The site of West Municipal Middle School was originally the Shanghai West School (Western School) of the Public Concession before the war, so the facilities are relatively complete and the school buildings are spacious. There are currently 19 classes with a total of 760 students, one-third of whom are girls. They have now implemented a system of separate classes for boys and girls.

Inquired About Trachoma

Mayor Wu left West Municipal Middle School at 10:35 AM and went to the Second Central National School in the Tenth District on Daxi Road. The school site was originally a British military camp before the war, covering an area of over nine mu, and the buildings were all flat wooden houses. The current access is inconvenient and requires turning into Lane 620 of Daxi Road, which is a narrow and dilapidated alley, winding and long, and not clean. After the snow, it is even more muddy. Only after repeated inquiries by the mayor and Deputy Director of the Education Bureau were they able to find the location of the school. After a short rest, they were accompanied by the person in charge of the school to visit the classrooms and the business office. The mayor was very concerned about the students' health and inquired about whether there were students with trachoma or lung disease. According to the response, 70% of the students have trachoma, and there are not many lung diseases, but most of the students are malnourished. After inspecting the entire school, the mayor felt that the inconvenient access that elementary school students must pass through every day was very poor. The person in charge of the school then led them to inspect No. 730 Daxi Road, where a road could be opened directly to the school. This requires contacting the Land Administration Bureau and the Public Works Bureau. Mayor Wu immediately instructed Deputy Director of the Education Bureau to discuss the matter with the Director of the Land Administration Bureau. After inspecting in the cold snow until noon at 12:00 PM, the planned visits to Gezhi Middle School and other places were postponed due to lack of time, and it was decided to go another day.

Summary of New Basketball Rules

Chapter 2: Duties of the Timekeeper, Section 4: Regarding the Timekeeper's duties during dead ball situations, the following has been revised:

At the end of each period of play, when an official calls a foul or a timeout (including substitution timeouts), and in the case of a dead ball as specified in Chapter 3, Article 8 (E), the game clock should be stopped immediately.

When registering a timeout or a substitution timeout, the timekeeper should immediately start the timeout clock, and notify the scorer when the allotted timeout time has expired, who will then inform the official to resume the game.

Chapter 4, Article 2: A ball that comes to rest on the side support of the basket is considered a "held ball." Article 10, Definition of a Jump Ball, has been slightly changed, the full text is as follows:

When two players, not of the same team, each hold the ball with one or both hands, a "jump ball" shall be declared, or if a player holding the ball is closely guarded by an opponent in his front court to the extent that he has no possibility of advancing or taking other action, a jump ball may also be declared.

Chapter 4, Article 3: The entire old rule is deleted, replaced with "Game Commencement After a Dead Ball," stating:

In the following situations, the game has commenced (i.e., is already in a non-dead ball period): when the official tosses the ball during a jump ball after the ball leaves his hand, when the ball is placed in front of the free throw shooter during a free throw.

Old Rule Article 3 has been restated in the new rule's Chapter 5, Article 10, with a slightly altered meaning, the full text is as follows:

Chapter 5, Article 10: After the timeout time has expired, when the official signals the timekeeper to start the clock, the game clock should be started immediately, unless there is an instruction to continue the timeout. If the official has not given the signal to start the game, the timekeeper has the privilege of starting the game clock.

(A) If the game is restarted with a jump ball, the game clock should be started when the official tosses the ball and the ball leaves his hand.

(B) If the free throw is missed and the game continues, then start the game clock when it is clear that the ball has failed to enter the basket.

(C) When a throw-in is used to continue the game, the game clock should be started when the ball touches the body of a player on the court (the old rule was when the ball crossed the boundary line).

Chapter 4, Article 7: New items (D) and (E) have been added, the regulations for personal fouls and technical fouls have been slightly changed, the full text is as follows:

(D) During the game, a foul in which a player makes physical contact with an opponent is called a "personal foul." (Chapter 10, Article 7)

(E) Fouls committed during a stoppage of play, or fouls committed by non-players, or fouls committed by players that do not involve physical contact with an opponent, are all technical fouls. (Chapter 10, Articles 2-6)

(Explanation) A foul involving physical contact that occurs during a stoppage of play is also considered a technical foul.

Chapter 5, Article 5: The "official timeout" during a 40-minute game in the old rule has been eliminated, but it is still maintained in 6-minute or 8-minute quarter games, and the application time has been changed to after 5 minutes have elapsed in the second or fourth quarter (the old rule was after 4 minutes).

Chapter 5, Article 8, is an important change: during the last three minutes of the second half and overtime in a 40-minute game, the game clock should be stopped for all dead balls. Within these three minutes, the timekeeper only needs to stop the game clock, without needing to wait for notification from the official, and without notifying the official or the teams.

In middle school age team games, the game clock should be stopped for all dead balls after an official timeout in the fourth quarter and during all overtime periods, without needing to follow the official's instructions.

Chapter 6, Article 3: The wording has been revised, and the meaning has been slightly altered: if two or more players from the same team are standing side by side in the restraining circle during a jump ball, then the opposing team has the right to request a change in their positions. The full text is as follows:

During a jump ball, each center must stand with both feet inside the half-circle farther from his own basket, or on its arc, and then the official will toss the ball between the two centers, on a plane perpendicular to the sideline, tossing the ball higher than the height any center can jump, so that it falls between the two of them. After the ball reaches its highest point, it must be tapped by either center or both centers simultaneously. If neither center taps the ball and it lands on the ground, then the official should re-toss the ball at the original spot to start the game. The ball must not be tapped before it reaches its highest point, and players must not leave the restraining circle before the ball is tapped. Each jumping player is limited to two taps of the ball.

After a jumping player's second tap, he must not touch the ball again before it has been touched by any one of the other eight non-jumping players, or before the ball touches the ground, the basket, or the backboard. According to the above, the jumping players have a total of four taps, that is, two taps per jumping player. (To be continued)

### Rain and Snow Affect Supply Sources; Rice Market Becomes Tight Again Yesterday; Social Bureau Notifies That Only Cash Transactions Are Allowed Today and Tomorrow

[Reported by this newspaper] Rice market conditions fluctuate. Yesterday, due to the severe cold and heavy snow, rice shipments from the mainland to Shanghai were slightly delayed, leading to increased confidence. Although prices in the producing areas were reported to be weak, customers were still reluctant to release their holdings, resulting in a tight market. White rice once exceeded the one million mark, reaching as high as 1.02 million, but later softened slightly due to tight credit, closing at 980,000, with each grade rising by 20,000 to 30,000 compared to the previous day.

Ji Mingbi, Chief of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau, stated yesterday: Rice market transactions could have returned to normal yesterday, but the heavy snow affected supply sources. In addition, since the 20th of this month (Saturday) is the bank's rest and settlement period, external payments will be suspended. If grain merchants pay for rice purchases with checks, they can delay cashing them until Monday of the following week. Most grain merchants are adding to their purchases, which has led to a price increase. I have already reported this to Mayor Wu and Director Wu and obtained their consent. To avoid speculators from buying in large quantities, the rice market has been notified that on the 19th and 20th (today and tomorrow), only cash transactions are allowed.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Show Mixed Trends

Flour prices dropped sharply at the opening but gradually rose during the closing, resulting in mixed strength and weakness. The trend for bran was stable. Soybean cake buyers remained inactive. Soybean trading was still quiet, but due to high production prices, sellers insisted on their prices, resulting in an early weak and midday strong market. Customer beans were stable, while broad beans were slightly firm. Green beans from Southeast Asia remained weak, with high-grade goods being average and medium-grade goods declining. Red beans from Guangdong have begun to be sought after, gradually showing signs of recovery. Kidney beans remained sluggish and lacking in trading activity. Broad beans rose sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 due to strong actual sales in cold weather. Red sorghum trading was lackluster, falling by 3,000 to 5,000. Northern corn trading was suspended as boat slots were full, causing a sharp drop of 30,000 to 40,000. Peanut kernels from Guangdong had few buyers, continuing to weaken by 10,000 to 20,000. Sesame was the most sluggish, declining step by step, weak and unable to stabilize, dropping by 20,000 to 30,000.

The oil market showed mixed trends. Soybean oil factories continued to supply sources, falling by 20,000 to 30,000. Sesame oil sales were sluggish, dropping by 30,000 to 50,000. Rapeseed oil continued to fall by 20,000 to 30,000. After continuous drops, shopkeepers took advantage of the situation to attract buyers, resulting in a recovery of 30,000 to 50,000 for raw oil.

### Hua Stocks Surge in Buying Interest; Many Small Stocks Hit Limit Up

Hua stocks experienced a surge in buying yesterday due to new buying groups outside the market and signs of loosening credit. Initially driven by the strength of small stocks, the buying trend spread widely due to the convenience of the market closure. Many small stocks hit limit up, with Yongsha reaching a new high.

The opening was only flat to weak, with Yongsha opening at 435 yuan and 455 yuan, then rising to 439 yuan and 464 yuan. Later, it retreated to low prices of 433 yuan and 45 yuan. With strong demand from all sides, the off-market interest rate opened slightly lower, at 0.3 yuan and 0.345 yuan, and credit loosened slightly, rising to 445 yuan and 469 yuan. Huafeng also started a rising trend, with immediate and deferred deliveries suspended. High prices were supplied, with some consolidation. Banks and other institutions were buying, pushing prices to a high of 448 yuan for immediate delivery and 473 yuan for deferred delivery. Later, prices rose again to 445 yuan for immediate delivery and 473 yuan for deferred delivery, before closing at 443 yuan and 472 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices for immediate delivery stocks, Huafeng hit limit up, Zhongfa rose by 50%, Zhabei improved by 10%, and Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, Shangwu, Jinglun, Huochai, Zhongfang, Tongyi, and Zhongge all rose by 50%. Yonggong, Datong, and Zhongni were flat, with the rest rising slightly. For deferred delivery stocks, Huafeng hit limit up, with the rest improving by 10% to 15%, mainly because the discount was very heavy.

In the after-market, Yongsha was sought after and rose, then retreated to 457 yuan and 475 yuan. When news of the National Bank's intervention spread, confidence was boosted, and Zhongfa, Nei, Yongye Gong, and Jinglun all hit limit up. Shangwu, Huochai, Tongyi, and Lian Di also hit limit up one after another. Yongsha then reached a new high of 480 yuan for immediate delivery and 489 yuan for deferred delivery. However, there was some disappointment with the National Bank's intervention, and prices retreated to 470 yuan and 480 yuan. The closing was still raised to 474 yuan and 485 yuan. As a result, compared to the latest closing prices for immediate delivery stocks, Zhongfa, Huafeng, Yonggong, Huochai, Jinglun, Yongye, and Lian Di hit limit up. Shangwu, Tongyi, and Neiyi hit limit up but then retreated, rising by 5% to 10%. Yongsha, Zhongfang, and Zhabei rose slightly, with the rest rising by 50%. For deferred delivery stocks, Huafeng still hit the limit, Meiya and Xinguang rose by 50%, with the rest rising slightly. Old stocks outside the market were still stable. The current deferred arbitrage trading saw rising interest rates due to the limited number of lenders from financial institutions, with the discount gradually rising from 0.22 yuan to 0.27 yuan. Yongsha initially opened at 22 yuan, rising from 21 yuan to close at 24.5 yuan. Xinguang rose from 10.5 yuan to 13 yuan, and Meiya rose from 29 yuan to 35 yuan. New Light also required a strong 2 yuan.

### National Bonds Sluggish; Foreign Stocks Mediocre

Government bonds continued to be sluggish yesterday. Tong Bing opened at 29,200 yuan, with a high of 29,800 yuan and a low of 27,000 yuan, then consolidating slightly. As a result, compared to the previous closing, A and B fell by 1,500, C fell by 1,800, D fell by 1,300, and E also fell by a small 900 yuan, with a turnover of about 5 million.

Foreign stocks fluctuated within mediocrity yesterday. Jardine Matheson sold, while Yisha Westerners and brokerage firms from Guangdong all bought. Yisha opened in the morning at 415,000 yuan, recovering to 425,000 yuan and then consolidating slightly. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Jardine Brewery rose by 50%, Navigation and Telephone were flat, Yisha and Baogang slightly rose, and British Union, De Feng, Yeguang, Tram, and Xiangtai slightly fell.

### Qianye Small Loan Group; Foundation Starts Recognizing

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Money Shop Trade Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors starting at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the organization of a small loan syndicate jointly formed by Shanghai money shops. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. It is understood that the foundation borne by each syndicate is divided into two types: 100 million yuan and 50 million yuan, which are determined by the syndicate members themselves. A circular will be sent to all syndicate members today, requesting them to reply within three days to confirm their determination, so that the syndicate can be established and contracts can be signed after the total amount of the foundation is determined.

It is rumored that there are approximately 78 members in the syndicate. The syndicate's loan office will be located within the Association. Each syndicate member will serve as an agency for applying for loans. A management committee will be established above the syndicate, and all syndicate members will be ex officio members. The management committee will be divided into three groups: review, audit, and design. The review group is responsible for reviewing each loan, the audit group audits the loan accounts, and the design group is responsible for improving the loan process. The loan interest rate is yet to be determined, but it is believed that it will not be too high. There are two types of loan recipients: small-scale handicrafts and small-scale businesses. The loan amount will not exceed 5 million yuan per loan, and either one shop guarantee or one personal guarantee will be required. The loan term will not exceed three months. Interest will be reduced along with the principal and will not be deducted in advance to reduce the interest burden on loan applicants. To actively promote loans, it is planned to apply to national banks for rediscounting in the future to facilitate the turnover of small loan funds.

### Banks and Money Shops Close Accounts; Suspension of Receipt and Delivery Tomorrow

Tomorrow is the period for banks and money shops to routinely settle interest for the second half of the year. All banks and money shops will routinely settle accounts and suspend external transactions for one day. It is understood that the general situation of the banking and money shop industry in this session is still good, and those with larger scale have made considerable profits.

### Hong Kong Legislative Council Passes New Bank Licensing System

[United Press Hong Kong, 18th] The Hong Kong Legislative Council passed the first reading of the new bank licensing system today. From now on, all banks in Hong Kong, whether already operating or not yet operating, will be subject to strict government control. If they violate the regulations, the Governor of Hong Kong has the right to revoke their business license. The government explained that the main reason for implementing this new system is that some banks lack sufficient financial strength, and some banks have violated commercial and exchange controls.

### Prices Determined for Paper and Steel Purchases

The Review Committee for Handling Imported Goods Arriving Without Licenses and Using Self-Provided Foreign Exchange held a regular meeting at 3:00 PM on the 18th on the fourth floor of the China Trust Bureau to discuss how to add surcharges to the cost of goods arriving at the port for allocation. The discussion focused on "paper" and "steel." As a result, paper was divided into fourteen types, each with a different price. The highest was kraft paper, with a surcharge of 210% of the cost of goods arriving at the port, and the lowest was newsprint, with a surcharge of 55%. Steel was divided into twelve types, with the highest being steel hoops, with a surcharge of 220%, and the lowest being scrap iron and broken iron, with a surcharge of 50%.

The Money Exchange Industry Declares Its Resolution to Obey the Order to Cease Operations

After the Financial and Monetary Management Bureau issued a message banning the money exchange industry, an explicit order was given to the Association on the morning of the 19th. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Association's Chairman Wang Yuncheng and Managing Director Liu Xichen paid a visit to Director Li to report that they would comply with the legal orders and instruct all members to comply with the orders. Director Li instructed that the industry's use of the names of banks and money shops was confusing with the names approved by the Ministry of Finance and should be rectified. All previously used bank and money shop names should be cancelled from today. If they change to other legitimate businesses and retain their original license numbers, the removal of the words "bank" and "money shop" would not be a problem. The Association has scheduled a general meeting of members at 2:00 PM this Saturday to end the operations.

It is understood that the Association had 240 to 250 members in its heyday. Since the government promulgated the Emergency Economic Measures Plan on February 17 of this year, banning the trading of gold and the circulation of foreign currencies, many have switched industries, such as cigarettes, canned goods, candy, and food. There are currently 188 members, with less than half paying membership dues.

### Cigarette Tax Still Pending; Credit Not Easy to Recover

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the National Bank had an excess collection of 58.1 billion yuan, and the tight credit situation has eased slightly. Shadow interest rates are slightly lower, from 0.25 yuan to 0.27 yuan. The off-market interest rates for Hua stocks have also fallen to 0.345 yuan. However, it is rumored that a large amount of cigarette tax, estimated at over 100 billion yuan, is still pending payment today, so the trend in credit will still tighten. Among the various banks, the Central Bank had an excess collection of 42 billion, large exchange outflow of 32.1 billion, foreign banks inflow of 67.5 billion, small exchange outflow of 93.5 billion, Chinese Bank inflow of 13.4 billion, and Transportation Bank outflow of 13 billion.

### Validity of Woolen Fabric Import Licenses; Import Management Permits Extension to Year-End

[Reported by this newspaper] According to information from the Secretariat of the Import and Export Control Commission: Regarding the import of woolen fabrics, the Commission has decided that the original validity period limit for licenses "before the announcement" was originally set to expire at the end of June this year, but is now permitted to be extended to the end of this year. Regarding the handling of imported goods arriving without licenses, the Commission's meeting stipulated that for imported goods in Appendix 3B (such as cigarettes, raw hides, bones, etc., goods with temporarily suspended import), except for woolen fabrics, if the importers are unwilling to re-export them, the China Trust Bureau may purchase them. Furthermore, the nature of the goods in Appendix 3B is different from that of goods such as wool and cotton, so they are not suitable for selling to the original importers after purchase and must be handled by way of public auction.

### Buyers' Appetite Weak; Downstream Market for Yarn and Cloth; 42-count Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Continues to Plunge by One Million Yuan

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw continued selling in the market due to the approaching settlement period for the second half of the year and tight positions on all sides. Buyers were not very active, with only scattered purchases from customer firms and slight absorption by weaving mills at closing. Prices continued to plunge by one million yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In addition, all other yarns also went downstream, with only 40-count Baoguang Ren Zhong and 32-count Fengnian yarns being actively purchased by various firms, resulting in a stable market.

In addition, yesterday's cotton cloth market saw pressure from short sellers at the opening due to news of the US envoy's intensified aid to China, and the market went downstream. Soon, rumors of exchange rate changes caused short covering for next-day delivery, and Shanxi firms also became active, with retail investors following suit, and prices turned firm. However, after 11:00 AM, yarn prices became sluggish again, hovering in the weak range, and buyers' appetite turned dull. In the end, 12-pound Longtou and Zhenzhong fine cloth fell by 3,000 to 70,000 yuan, while Wufu, Caiqiu, Lanjiyanghe, and other fine cloths recovered from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan. In addition, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and biggie and zhitong, etc., also improved by 5,000 to 35,000 yuan, while the market for other cloths was clearly flat and secretly weak.

In addition, the China Textile Construction Company routinely sold cloth yesterday, selling a total of 5,340 bolts and 80 bedsheets, with a total of 125 purchase orders. Internal manufacturers submitted 2 orders, purchasing 240 bolts, and cloth merchants submitted 123 orders, purchasing 5,100 bolts and 80 bedsheets.

Raw Cotton Stagnant

Trading in the raw cotton market yesterday was sparse, partly due to tight credit and inflexible turnover, and partly due to weather conditions and incomplete staffing. Only one transaction was made, consisting of 120 bales of Hankou fine velvet, priced at 4.96 million, and 900,000 for Zhoupu seed cotton.

### Silk and Satin Hovering on a Weak Trajectory

The price of rayon yesterday had fallen to be similar to the allocated price for this week, so there was not much fluctuation throughout the day. The asking price for 120-count Xu Zi Youguang was 76 million yuan at the morning close. It had risen to 65 million yuan in the afternoon, but finally retreated and was sold at the morning closing price. However, credit was very tight, with more sellers than buyers, and trading was extremely rare.

Factory-Processed Silk

Hovering on a weak trajectory, the market continued to decline yesterday. The asking price for CD grade had fallen to within the 90 million yuan level. High-grade lingdan was at 86 million yuan, and it was still a seven-day term asking price, but still no one inquired, so yesterday's transaction can be said to be almost non-existent. The price of dried silk also fell by 1 million yuan, and there were no transactions to speak of.

Silk Fabrics

Yesterday's market saw a sharp decline in real silk quilt covers again. The opening transaction price for Huaqiang goods was around 3.8 million yuan, and it quickly fell to between 3.3 million and 3.4 million yuan, hovering there. Finally, because there were more people seeking to offload their holdings, the closing price fell to 3 million yuan for immediate delivery, which was 1 million yuan lower than the previous day. Next-day arbitrage started at 500,000 yuan, then rose to a large 700,000 yuan. Other goods also declined, and due to the threat of tight credit, many people were reluctantly cutting losses.

### Textile Construction Plans to Prepare an Estimated Table for the Purchase of This Year's National Cotton

[Reported by this newspaper] The Textile Regulation Committee commissioned the Textile Construction Company to provide a purchase estimate for this year's national cotton in preparation for a unified purchase plan. It is learned that Textile Construction has prepared an accurate estimate based on actual data. According to the estimate, the amount of cotton that each factory can purchase and store by the end of this year will generally reach 21.2 million dan. Because this batch of raw cotton is self-purchased by each factory, it should not be included in the unified purchase figure.

It is tentatively scheduled that the unified purchase of national cotton will be implemented from January next year. It is estimated that from January next year until the new cotton comes on the market, approximately 3 million dan can still be purchased. At 5 million yuan per dan, a capital of 15 trillion yuan will be required. It is estimated that the turnover capital for the unified purchase of national cotton will be approximately 600 million to 700 million yuan.

### Commercial Briefs

The International Trade Promotion Association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Metropolitan Hotel at 3:00 PM today to pass its articles of association and elect directors and supervisors.

The Textile Export Committee for American Cotton, a foreign exchange import commodity, will begin accepting registrations and reviewing purchases from today. The total amount of American cotton is more than 23,000 bales, and the registration process will be handled first.

New Medicine and New Drugs

Edited by the Shanghai Medical Association

### Reaffirming Our Journal's Policy

— Fan Shouyuan

It has been a full ten months since the resumption of publication of this journal. In the first issue of our revived journal, when we initially met our readers, there was an "opening statement" explaining our journal's policy and attitude, which was a great piece by Dr. Liang Junqing entitled "Our Stance." Ten months later, as we review our work performance over the past year, it seems that we have been able to follow our established work policy and have not strayed too far from our general direction. If we were to express some dissatisfaction, it would be that we have not yet completed a certain percentage of our planned work, or that our work performance is not as satisfactory as we had ideally hoped. However, the limited space of the newspaper prevents us from developing our ideas as fully as we would like, and this is one of the reasons.

Recently, to review the past achievements of this journal and its future work policy, we convened an editorial meeting and discussed the editorial policy and scope once again. Among the points raised, there are several important aspects that seem to require reiteration.

The name of this medical journal, "New Medicine and New Drugs," originally continued the old name of the medical journal previously published by Shen Bao several years ago. Adding the word "new" to this medical and pharmaceutical title does not mean that there is some new invention every day, or that there is some new trick every issue, to be presented to our readers. "New medicine and new drugs" refers to modern medicine and scientific medicine. This is because in China, there is still another type of old medicine. Adding the word "new" to the title of medicine is to distinguish it from the inherent old medicine. The original intention of adopting this name for the publication was probably for this reason. Although this has little to do with the editorial policy, it is necessary to explain it in this way for the sake of clarity.

If we say that science in China is still in the early stages of primary school, then scientific new medicine in China, to put it bluntly, is still in the even more nascent kindergarten stage. The reasons for this immaturity lie in various objective factors, but the Chinese people's lack of emphasis on science, their lack of emphasis on scientific medicine, and especially their lack of a correct understanding of the essence and concepts of modern science, are also major contributing factors. The minds of most Chinese people are still filled with metaphysical national essence concepts and national treasure ideas of metaphysical medicine. Their understanding of scientific new medicine is only superficial and partial, and they have not yet reached the stage of thorough and firm trust. This is a major reason why the advancement of scientific new medicine in China cannot proceed at a rapid pace. To accelerate the advancement of scientific new medicine in Chinese society, the only way is to awaken the Chinese people's recognition and emphasis on scientific new medicine. Only when the Chinese people value science and everyone understands new medicine can the construction of scientific new medicine be accelerated. Only by accelerating the construction of the new medicine undertaking with united efforts can we match the construction of a modern new country. This is the first and foremost work policy of this journal; it has been so in the past, it is so now, and it will continue to be so in the future.

The second work policy, which is also the working goal of all popular medical journals, is an old tune: to promote hygiene common sense and to impart medical common sense. The future work policy of this journal seems to take this goal as its central task and as our important mission. The Chinese people are not only economically impoverished, but also intellectually impoverished and lacking in common sense, especially in terms of medical and health common sense. Indeed, the lack of common sense is closely related to economic poverty, but there are also parts that are not entirely related to economics. For example, writing articles on medical and health common sense in this type of newspaper medical journal has little to do with the economy of the general public. The only drawback is that its effectiveness is limited to a small number of literate readers, but this is an unavoidable fact. What we can pay attention to is only the writing skills. In other words, if the writing skills are handled properly, the effectiveness of promotion and imparting can also be expanded and deepened. To explain it concretely, it means that since we aim to promote or impart medical common sense, we must always pay attention to the general reader as the target when we write, and it is not appropriate to take the doctors themselves as the target. In other words, it should be popularized, not specialized. We should strive for interestingness and avoid didactic mechanization. Medical knowledge is inherently relatively boring, and if it is written in a mechanical and rigid way, readers will definitely find it dull. In this way, the effectiveness of our promotion and imparting will inevitably be greatly reduced, and it will be difficult to achieve in-depth and universal purposes. This, of course, depends on each person's writing talent, but we can only encourage ourselves with this, and hope that all colleagues who write for this journal will pay attention to it.

Third, this is not a work policy, but it is a point that should be noted. This belongs to the aspect of choosing materials when publicizing medical knowledge, and this is also worth our attention and mention. Since this medical journal takes the promotion of medical and health common sense as its major purpose, we will advocate paying as much attention as possible to the topics of prevention and health maintenance in the future, and strive to reduce the topics of treatment and medication. This is because the former certainly belongs to the scope of popular medical knowledge and is needed by readers. Reading it is only beneficial and has no drawbacks. The latter is mostly a technical issue for doctors themselves. Readers read it with a superficial understanding, and it is not beneficial. If there are occasional random experiments, the drawbacks will be great and the danger will be extraordinary. This is something that authors who promote medical and health common sense cannot foresee. We can only pay attention to it in advance to prevent the possibility of such unexpected drawbacks.

Fourth, this is also something that our responsible editor-in-chief and all colleagues who write articles for this journal should pay attention to, that is, this journal is limited by space and should not have overly long manuscripts. It is best for each article to have a word count of 1,000 to 1,400 or 500 words. Because overly long manuscripts often lead to continuous installments, which will make readers feel that they cannot read it in one go. This is what we hope all contributors, especially those submitting from abroad, will pay attention to.

Finally, there is one more point worth reporting to readers, that is, within the possible scope in the future, we plan to publish one or two novel illustrations in each issue. In this way, perhaps it will increase the interest of readers a little?

### The Origin of Medicine is Love

— Wang Juerong

Paracelsus was right! "The origin of medicine is indeed love!" In this world where customs are not as old as they used to be and moral standards are declining, it is no wonder that medical disputes are springing up like mushrooms. We doctors, in addition to seeking legal protection, the only way to prevent this is to develop the "love" that is the origin of medicine! Take love as the patient's "guarantor" and use "love" to replace all "consent forms and guarantees."

Only "love" can enable us to develop more compassion and greater mercy. In this world filled with the clouds of war, only when everyone develops true love can we eliminate the future human catastrophe forever!

People in society respect pastors and doctors because their expectations are too high, and sometimes they inevitably criticize them harshly. In the same situation, people in society need medicine merchants and rice merchants, they are indispensable! Because of the urgent need, the rise in prices of medicine and rice also inevitably makes people criticize medicine merchants and rice merchants!

In this turbulent era, it is a touchstone of our morality and personality. May the leaders of our medical and pharmaceutical groups link up the eight groups that are closely related and share common interests: the Physicians' Association, the Dentists' Association, the Pharmacists' Association, the Midwives' Association, the Pharmaceutical Technicians' Association, the Nurses' Association, the New Drug Industry Association, and the Pharmaceutical Industry Association. Taking Paracelsus' famous saying as a foundation, we should take on the sacred mission for this difficult social group. We must use the "love" that is the origin of medicine to lay the foundation for new medicine and new drugs in China! Give society the best impression!

"Whether day or night, if you are willing, still lock up your restless heart! Is someone knocking on the door? Good! 'Please come in!' Even if it is often midnight; no need to ask the name of the visitor, just ask him if he has suffering. If he is thirsty, if he is hungry... Welcome him, satisfy him!" This is another passage from Mr. Hugo in Les Misérables. I not only picked up a pen, but also added a few sentences to end today's "Occasional Thoughts After Diagnosis"!

"If he is sick, sympathize with him, comfort him, help him, take his suffering as your own, and take his sick child as your beloved son. In this way, we will never be negligent or make mistakes again!"

Although in today's society, what is lacking is "love" and what is abundant is "hate," as long as we tens of thousands of medical and pharmaceutical colleagues unite and develop our sacred "love" to wash away all the "hate" in the world, the future peace and happiness of society will be built on the cornerstone of our efforts!

Finally, I hope that people from all walks of life will give us the greatest sympathy and encouragement! (To be continued)

### Overview of Physiological Products

— Wang Meixian

Biological products are finished products manufactured based on bacteriology, serology, and immunology, and have a major relationship with medicine. They can not only be applied to treatment after illness, but also prevent diseases before they occur, eradicate epidemics in the invisible, and maintain human health.

The application of biological products is based on the principles of immunology, inoculating them into animal bodies to automatically or passively obtain immunity, in order to prevent or treat infectious diseases. The first invention was by Mr. Jenner in 1778, who used cowpox vaccine to inoculate humans to prevent smallpox. In 1880, Mr. Pasteur also used attenuated anthrax, chicken cholera bacilli, and rabies virus to make vaccines for prevention. In 1890, Mr. Behring manufactured diphtheria toxin and antitoxin, and in 1892, Mr. Behring and Mr. Kitasato manufactured tetanus toxin and antitoxin. These were epoch-making innovations in preventive medicine and therapeutic medicine. In this type of invention and continuous progress, the survival and happiness of mankind have been fully guaranteed.

The biological products that are currently manufactured and commonly used are of the following four types: Vaccines: Some are made from bacterial bodies (Bacteria), including cholera simple vaccine, typhoid simple vaccine, cholera-typhoid mixed vaccine, typhoid-paratyphoid mixed vaccine, plague vaccine, pertussis vaccine, and anti-tuberculosis vaccine (B.C.G.).

Some are made from viruses, including rabies vaccine (two types for humans and dogs) and typhus vaccine.

Toxins: Made from exotoxins produced by bacteria, including diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, Schick test diphtheria toxin, and Dick test scarlet fever toxin.

Serum Antitoxins: All those made by injecting bacterial bodies into horses to immunize them are called Sera, which are antibacterial against the bacteria themselves, including plague serum and dysentery serum. All those made by injecting bacterial exotoxins into horses to immunize them are called Antitoxins, which are antitoxic against the exotoxins produced by bacteria, including diphtheria antitoxin, tetanus antitoxin, gas gangrene antitoxin, and botulism antitoxin.

### Electrical Anesthesia

— Xiang Longzhou

With the advancement of science, there are constant innovations, each with its own ability. The application of modern electricity is so widespread that it can be said to have reached its extreme. However, its application to the human body is still limited. In the past, it was only limited to assistive products in sound therapy, such as X-ray fluoroscopy and ultraviolet radiation for skin treatment, and direct application to the human body was almost non-existent. It is now heard that electricity can be used as an anesthetic. The application of this method, discovered by two young Australian medical students, to surgical operations is truly a major reform in modern medicine.

These two inventors are both third-year students in the Department of Medicine at the University of Melbourne. One is named Mr. Samuel Rose and the other is named Mr. Donald Rabinov. Both are only twenty years old. The results of their research are more positive and effective than the results of research by people from all walks of life in 1905.

They expect that this new method will take effect immediately, without any after-effects, will not cause breathing difficulties, and will not have a significant impact on the heart. Many experiments have been done at the University of Melbourne to prove that this type of electrical anesthesia can indeed be practically applied. According to the experimenters, there is no doubt that when appropriate electricity is passed through the body, it can make humans and animals fall into a prolonged sleep, and there is no uncomfortable feeling.

The instrument used for this application was specially designed and constructed by the Australian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. This special design is quite similar in appearance to the configuration of a radio receiver. It is small in size and can be moved freely when needed in emergency situations, and can be applied to ordinary daily-use power sources.

This type of electrical anesthesia has been used for further academic trials at Melbourne Public Hospital, and the results have been satisfactory. According to the report of the live experiment at the hospital at that time, when the current was passed through the patient's body, the patient immediately entered a state of sleep. When the current was stopped, the patient gradually woke up, and there were no pain or effects afterward. This experiment used a current of 120 volts, energizing about 100 times per second.

In the initial stage of the implementation of this method, mice were used as test subjects. They were anesthetized by electricity for ten minutes every day for five days in a row. After the last power-off, the animals were immediately examined carefully. As a result, the animals were not affected in the slightest, and they could still perform various trainings they had received in the past as usual.

According to the two young inventors, based on the results of their later experiments this year, they are preparing to further explore this research work. The school authorities have also given them a lot of valuable help.

Dr. R. D. Wright, Professor of Physiology at the University of Melbourne, commented that electricity used as an anesthetic is a very valuable contribution to the treatment of neurological diseases and surgical applications. Electrical anesthesia is easier to control than commonly used injections and inhalants. If this method can continue to be applied further, it will revolutionize the commonly used practical anesthesia method. (Translated from The Medical World - Aug. 1947 P. 197 "Electricity as an Anesthetic")

### Hint Chapter

— Shi Yu

A man was strolling on the road, when suddenly he stopped and looked up at the sky. Apart from white clouds and fleeting moments, there was really nothing else in the sky, but in an instant, a group of people gathered around him, also looking up at the sky. And their necks were stretched longer than his, and their eyeballs were more protruding than his. For example, watching a ball game. The more nervous the players kick, the more excited and ecstatic the fans become. When the so-called "critical moment" is kicked, the fans may jump up from their chairs, clench their fists, and be in a running posture. Even more people shake their legs and make kicking motions. Some people even kick the buttocks of the people in front of them without realizing it.

Merchants can perhaps be said to be the people in the world who best understand dark clouds. Since Jewish merchants in the United States invented the method of installment payments, their business has flourished more than a thousand times. For example, if you want to buy an electric refrigerator, it hurts a bit to take out $200 at once, but it doesn't matter to take out $30 a month. The candy store owner in Nanjing seems to understand this psychology, and changed all the candy codes from "jin" or "pound" to "liang." When I went to buy peanuts, he told me how much a liang costs, but never said how much a jin costs. Nine hundred yuan a liang, it sounds really cheap! Psychologists tell us that many of our daily actions are "suggested" by others. Even a frown or a smile cannot escape this principle. For example, watching a Hollywood movie: the protagonist occasionally says a witty remark, and the whole theater is filled with laughter. But if you ask them why they are laughing, at least half of them will stare blankly, not knowing what to answer. Some people laugh because they see others laughing interestingly; some people laugh because they see others laughing and are embarrassed not to laugh. The Western saying, "Laugh and the world laughs with you!" contains the truth of "suggestion."

The so-called "suggestion" means being led by the nose by others invisibly. There is such a story: someone's house was stolen, but they saw a man screaming for thieves. Everyone ran around, but to no avail. In fact, the friend who was screaming for thieves was the thief himself. For example, if you go to a big hotel to enjoy a good meal: even if you eat oxtail soup, if the waiter asks you, "Sir, do you want to add an egg?" If you are thrifty by nature, you can naturally not add it; but if the waiter asks you, "Sir, do you want to add one egg or two eggs?" you will be embarrassed not to add it! Thinking carefully, life is nothing more than being led by the nose by others, it's just that we don't realize it ourselves. When you are a baby, the nanny leads you by the nose; when you are a child, the family leads you by the nose; the older you get, the more people lead you by the nose, and the wider the scope. If you live to be thirty years old, it means that you have been led by the nose for thirty years. Naturally, you will not agree with this sentence, because you used to often mistakenly think that you are an independent person. Just as Dong Shi rarely admits that she is not beautiful, there are few people in the world who claim to be ordinary. Although the facts tell us that our joys, sorrows, anger, and happiness, especially our worldview and thoughts, are entirely the result of a few people leading us by the nose. A few people create trends (Current), and we are swept into the trend. Two fashion store owners discuss raising the collar of women's cheongsams, and before long it becomes fashionable, and you wear a high-collar cheongsam and take pride in it, even if the "high collar" completely obscures your femininity or beauty. The style of American men's clothing is led by the wide students of universities such as Yale and Princeton; the style of American women's clothing is led by fashion experts in Paris.

If you nod after reading my stuff, you are influenced by my suggestion; if you shake your head after reading my stuff, you are also influenced by my suggestion. Friend, do you understand this meaning?

### Small Cups and Dishes to Pass the Cold Night

— Guangjue

Someone's poem: "At night, there are rumors coming in, newly bought half a bed of books," and also said: "In the past, I was so poor that I didn't have a single cent, and I added half a bookshelf with my winnings. This year, gamblers are lazy and near, so bookworms should also be completely sparse." After reading it, I was happy for a long time, because winning money in gambling is an unexpected thing, and now buying a few books is also considered a heroic act, and it is impossible to get more, almost only when winning money in gambling can you buy a few books as you wish.

The art of war says: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle," thinking about how cruel it is. Gamblers often have the right to survive, and winning is very uncomfortable. Thinking about myself again, losing money is also not necessary. So, I suddenly wanted to take a break from gambling.

Having gotten used to nightlife, I can't fall asleep when I get home in the middle of the night. It's cold again, and apart from drinking some wine, there is probably no better way. Buy some chicken wings in advance, drive home, and see if there are any stalls that have not been removed on the road, and add some intestines and tripe. When I get home, I take out the only stock of top-grade sorghum liquor, and also find some dried shrimp, dried vegetables, peanuts, etc., fill several dishes the size of foreign coins, and start pouring and drinking by myself. The children's faces, like apples, are placed on the pillow, they won't turn sour and quarrel with you; the woman is also extremely tired, says a word or two vaguely, and has already fallen asleep snoring. So, I spread a book on hand and casually flip through it, getting a sentence such as "Small cups and dishes to pass the cold night." Although it is not New Year's Eve, it is also sending off the year, which can be a knowing smile. The wintersweet in the bottle quietly emits some fragrance, which makes you feel even more: it is really not difficult for a person to be a god sometimes.

### Old Poems, Present Scenes

— Dong Jinhu

Recently, I bought a remnant collection of He Yisun of Yongxin, with only one volume of Shui Tian Ju Wen and more than three volumes of poems. Although there are many missing pages, there are about five hundred poems. He was a master of poetry and prose in the late Ming Dynasty. Unfortunately, his name was overshadowed by the nine sons of Yitang, so the world knows little about him. I have been buying books, and I don't choose much. Reading is also easy. He's collection was obtained by chance. His writing style is close to Wei Shuzi, but it is more unrestrained. The poems are not very good, but the folk songs in the collection, which describe the folk life at that time, make my heart jump, because the things of three hundred years ago are still the same today.

The eighteenth folk song says:

"The burden of service weighs heavily on this body, I will not refuse poverty in this life, even if my marrow is exhausted. Let my children have a moment of joy, and save one person for tomorrow's breakfast."

The last sentence seems humorous, but its sorrow is even greater than a long wail of blood.

The fourteenth verse says:

"Although the government is harsh, I have no words of complaint, but I complain that my ancestors' old business still exists. I envy the families in the east after they are ruined, and the urging of rent in the middle of the night does not startle their souls."

This verse is somewhat exaggerated, but the oppression of the people by the yamen is the real situation. This was the case at the turn of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and it is still the same today. I am a native of Jiangnan, and I have a small ancestral business. My family fears officials like thieves, because the property is small and not subject to taxation, but if the family is ruined, they will not be able to live.

The eighth and ninth folk songs say:

"The Baojia pays money and the service is not peaceful, the old records of the Shecang demand the fleeing Ding, the treacherous officials rely on the laws of the sages, and the poor Zhan are wrongly scolded by Kao Ting."

"Babies are carried away from distant villages, the farewell smoke rises from the thatched gates, Taoyuan is also tormented by mulberry and hemp taxes, where is the immortal family that does not break the soul."

These two verses both depict the real scene of rural life. It is not easy to see this in peaceful times, but in times of war, there are wailing everywhere, as Mencius said, "There is no escape from death in a year of famine." He Yisun was once a tribute student of the Ming Dynasty. In the Ding You year of Shunzhi, he wanted to recommend him as a commoner when he patrolled Jiangshang. Therefore, he changed into monk's clothes. His ordination was probably the same state of mind as Chen Zhanghou and Fang Mizi. It was because they first had the pain of their families and country, not because they were addicted to the Western Paradise. However, He wrote the folk sentiments of Ganzhong in the early Qing Dynasty into poetry, and when I read it, it is as if I were seeing the current scenes of Jiangnan. The dynasties are different, and the places are different, but after three hundred years, it is still the same as one day, and the situation is particularly sad. I have been traveling around for more than twenty years! The scenes of my hometown have been the same for ten years. Everything is sad, and everything is angry. I love them but cannot help them, and I only have sorrow. My feelings are perhaps similar to He Yisun's writing of folk songs, which is very lamentable.

### Mysteries of Insects

— Tong Tuo

A French scientist once studied the power of insects and discovered that a beetle could drag objects forty times its own weight. This means that if a beetle were the size of a horse and its physical strength increased proportionally, it could drag 100,000 pounds.

The pyramids are only 450 feet high, and the tallest building in the world is 1,250 feet, which is just over 200 times taller than a 6-foot-tall man. However, the nests of African termites are a thousand times taller than the termites that build them.

A small green bottle fly pupa can jump out of a box four feet deep. If a person had this jumping ability, they could stand on flat ground, without a running start, and jump onto the roof of an eight-story building. The jumping ability of fleas is even greater, being able to jump to a distance 200 times their length. In human terms, this would be equivalent to jumping over a thousand feet.

Imagine a person sitting down to eat a sumptuous lunch! A whole chicken, vegetables, and "Pan" could keep them from being hungry all afternoon. But if they had the appetite of a dragonfly and their body size increased proportionally, eating this small amount would be like a tiny plate of snacks, easy and effortless. It has been seen that a dragonfly can eat forty flies in two hours. The size ratio between a chicken and a human is similar to that between a fly and an ordinary dragonfly. However, people do not eat chickens, including the bones.

The dragonfly is the insect with the biggest appetite of all creatures in the world. As long as dragonflies have something to eat, they can stand quietly on a needle, seemingly without resistance. A natural scientist even cut off a dragonfly's own tail and fed it to its hungry mouth! (Translator's note: There is a Chinese idiom "dragonfly eating its own tail," which sufficiently demonstrates that both Chinese and foreign dragonflies have such great appetites that they are willing to fill their hunger with their own tails.)

"He Xin Lang" - Baili Liang Rengong's articles often run into thousands of words, flowing endlessly. His patriotic thoughts overflow his words, making him even more admirable. However, his Ci poems are rarely seen. Now, reading his "He Xin Lang" Ci poem, it resonates with a clear and resounding tone. The Ci goes: "Last night, wrapped in the east wind, I reluctantly looked back, the moon illuminated the homeland, so desolate! Bestowing Quanshou to seek Qin is a common dream, could it be that Jun Tian is indulging in drunkenness, and doesn't care about the haggard state of the world. The setting sun dyes the long smoke of the border passes black, gazing at Yinshan, the iron cavalry roams the land, the Han army is defeated, the sound of drums dies! The beauty remains, but the mountains and rivers are different. Whose family's solemn lying Yang, is snoring away! I don't believe in the descendants of a thousand-year-old deity, are there no more men in this world? I ask the spring water, what does it have to do with you? I grieve that people are unseen, and seek the heroic tears of Mingyi. The sound of chickens is chaotic, and the sword light rises." In the spring of March of the eighth year of the Republic of China, Shang Xiaoyun, one of the four famous Dan actresses, got married in Beiping. At that time, Mr. Fan Fanshan had a "He Xin Lang" Ci to congratulate her, saying: "Spring society mandarin duck meeting. Betting on Jin Xuan's high hall, a smile, a perfect pair. Don't think of them as hermaphrodite twin apricots, just consider them flower sisters. Her character is golden, gentle, jade-like. The beauties of Beili know the news, and laughing He can hardly cure the Qingmei taste. Those without blessing, don't be jealous. Golden lotus under her feet, spring makeup is beautiful. Waiting for dusk, personally remove the emerald Dian, and replace her pine pearl pendants; at first glance, strange and shy, carefully examining her delicate face, expecting each other's souls to be intoxicated; willow Dai Yun Huan Nong are all there, only the curved Gong Wan socks please people, you must plant five branches of cinnamon." In the Ci, such sentences as "Don't think of them as hermaphrodite twin apricots, just consider them flower sisters... Willow Dai Yun Huan Nong are all there," express what others cannot express, truly wonderfully unparalleled. If it were used to present to someone else, it would not only be unsuitable but also be a case of "lacking communication." This is what makes this Ci poem good. Reading these two Ci poems in one breath, the initial one soars into the sky, while the final one is like taking a dose of "cooling powder."

### Rescuing Beggar Children

— Xu Jin

The most important work of winter relief is "rescuing beggar children." It is too cruel, too tragic, and too inhuman to let beggar children freeze to death on the streets! Frankly speaking, this is not something that those organizing winter relief can sit idly by and watch.

According to the "Cha Ye Bao" yesterday (the 17th), Pushan Villa and Tongren Fuyuan Hall collected corpses within two days, totaling ten adult street corpses and one hundred and thirty-one child corpses. Judging from the usual mortality rate, this is already an alarming number. Moreover, from this, we can know that children's resistance to cold is far less than that of adults, so more children freeze to death than adults. Precisely because of this, we should rush to rescue beggar children. Children are the seedlings of the nation and the vitality of the country. Children who become beggars are no exception. After proper education and cultivation, they are also national treasures. I dare say that rescuing beggar children is as important as rescuing the nation.

Quickly rescue beggar children! Gentlemen who are organizing winter relief.

### Free Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

### Chapter 4: Two Hearts in Harmony (18)

Qi Wan paused to catch her breath, then continued: "I have tried every possible method, and only now have I found a clue. Because my resources are too limited, the easiest and most profitable thing to do right now is to perform 'Spinning Cotton,' a new novelty play. This kind of play can not only fill seats but is also easy to please and doesn't require adding many costumes. Recently, Dong Zizhi and Hu Xichun performed 'Spinning Cotton' in other places and bought several houses. Everyone says that spinning cotton is a real way to get rich and return home. Many people have advised me to learn from them and perform 'Spinning Cotton,' change my style, which is both easy and profitable. My father strongly opposed it, saying that allowing me to perform was already a concession. Performing Mei school's orthodox plays was still acceptable, but performing 'Spinning Cotton' would be even more of a joke, not only insulting my status but also affecting my father's reputation. Think about it, my environment is like this, and my family insists on this, isn't my future very bleak?" Qi Wan's voice trembled slightly as she spoke, as if feeling extremely stimulated. Just then, the moon was obscured by a dark cloud again. Qi Wan unintentionally leaned her body against Zhu Zhai's side and said, "What do you think I should do?" Zhu Zhai said, "Don't be discouraged, things are up to people!" Qi Wan said, "I have never been willing to tell others my troubles, but because you are sincere, I am telling you. I am grateful for your encouragement, but I am afraid I can't do it. A fallen leaf returns to its roots, everyone has a final destination. Being in this kind of environment, I can't help but feel discouraged. In addition, there is a lot of gossip outside about my family, which really makes it difficult for me." Qi Wan's voice choked as she spoke. Zhu Zhai saw her shoulders twitching, realizing that she was moved and crying. He felt sad for a moment and quickly wanted to find a handkerchief for her, but when he touched his pocket, he didn't have one, remembering that he had just placed his handkerchief on the stone bench for her to sit on. At this time, Qi Wan had already taken out her own handkerchief and dabbed it at the corners of her eyes, leaning on Zhu Zhai's body, silently. Zhu Zhai wanted to comfort her, but he couldn't find the words for a moment. The two sat quietly, while the moon in the sky revealed half of itself through the gaps in the clouds again. Zhu Zhai, in the dim moonlight, saw tears still on Qi Wan's face, thinking that this person was full of emotion. It was truly rare that a weak woman could fight so hard. Her outside was full of joy, but her heart contained pain. Once touched by warm affection, her true feelings would be aroused. At this moment, a gust of autumn wind blew softly, and the moon disappeared again. Zhu Zhai couldn't help but gently squeeze Qi Wan's hand, feeling it was cold. He asked in surprise, "Are you cold?" Qi Wan slightly retracted her hand and said, "I'm not cold! Let's go." Saying that, she stood up and picked up Zhu Zhai's handkerchief from the stone bench, tucking it into her purse. She handed her own handkerchief to Zhu Zhai and said, "My handkerchief has been sat on by me, how can you take it out to wipe your face again? You keep this one."

Social Services

Shen Bao, Ren He Hospital, Bao Li Hospital, and Shang Xian Women and Children Hospital jointly organize maternity assistance.

### Jin Hua Feng Family Generously Donates 10 Million Yuan, Hoping Poor Mothers Can Apply Early, and Enthusiastic Philanthropists Can Donate More

In November, the "Free Maternity Assistance for Poor Women" movement assisted a total of 25 poor mothers, with Ren He Hospital delivering 13 babies, costing a total of 8,488,000 yuan; Shang Xian Maternity Hospital delivered 7 babies, costing a total of 6,642,400 yuan; and Bao Li Hospital delivered 5 babies, costing a total of 3,000,000 yuan. The total delivery costs for the three hospitals were 18,130,400 yuan. According to the contract, this newspaper should bear half of the cost, which is 9,065,200 yuan. Although more than 9 million is not a huge number, the recent sharp decline in donations and the surge in the number of mothers entering the program have caused us considerable difficulties. However, we are not discouraged and will continue to provide poor mothers with the greatest assistance.

Mr. Jin Bifeng generously agreed, starting in October, to bear all the expenses that this publication has to pay for "Maternity Assistance for Poor Women." This time, he has taken on the responsibility of paying more than 9 million yuan. This has given us strong support and truly provided greater security for poor women.

We hope that enthusiastic people in society can be as charitable and generous as Mr. Jin, so that the "Maternity Assistance for Poor Women" movement can expand day by day and become a powerful new force in maternal health care.

### The "Rise" and "Fall" of Numbers

— Qing Xue

In this abnormal economic situation, numbers that were not easily seen in practical use are now becoming as common as running water accounts, becoming "thoroughly domestic." Although stimulating to the nerves, they are also quite interesting to study. One type is astronomical numbers, and the other is exaggerated numbers.

The characteristic of astronomical numbers is not the complexity of the numbers themselves, but the number of zeros. For example, the sun is 1,300,000 times larger than the earth. The "number" is only the two digits "13," but the "zeros" are five in number. Mercury's orbit around the sun is 36,000,000 miles. The number is only the two digits "36," but the zeros are six in number. The weight of the earth (in tons) has only the number "16," but the zeros are twenty-six in number, like a locomotive pulling a long string of train cars, or like a chain, or like a large lantern for the Lantern Festival dance.

Such numbers were previously unnecessary in daily life. Those who occasionally saw them were only in large national statistics, such as population surveys and reports of money and grain. As for ordinary transactions, private accounts, and the prices of goods, there were definitely not so many zeros. However, this is not the case now.

Yesterday, in a department store, many felt hats were displayed in the large glass window. The top one, an American new style, was priced with a "2" followed by six zeros. (Enough for the entire grain tax revenue of Jiangsu Province). The rest were priced at over one million, seven or eight hundred thousand, five or six hundred thousand, etc. Each "number" was followed by a string of "zeros." Hats were like this, and coats and suits were even more so, without exception, with large and extra-large strings of zeros, all astronomical numbers.

Exaggerated numbers were formerly imaginary or vague, such as "hundreds of millions of trillions." They were always in existence but not in use. But now, the expenses of even a small organization, the costs of a small construction project, or the settlement of accounts of a small shop are all in the hundreds of millions!

The old "hundred million" could be seen in the palace examination essays and in the congratulatory words of ministers wishing the emperor a long reign. Such as "Our country has a long reign of hundreds of millions of years," "Great Ming (or Great Qing) for hundreds of millions of years." That is "Long live, long live, long long live" (what the Westerners call "Long live the king"). Because "Long live, long live, long long live" is too wordy and too vulgar, it is not elegant to use in memorials or articles. So, the idle and ancient "hundred million" was used, which both intensified the praise and appeared to be economical in sentence structure. (Similar to the modern economic experts' advocacy of issuing large banknotes to save on paper and the number of characters, which can be said to have a similar perspective. A smile.)

In fact, how could a dynasty last for "hundreds of millions of years"? Even an emperor could not live to such an age. However, the emperor considered himself "long live" without doubt, and the ministers revered "long live" as if it were a real thing. So, it can only be considered an "exaggerated number."

However, "Astronomical" numbers are now commonly seen in human affairs. Exaggerated numbers are now commonly used in the market. Therefore, it is said that the abnormal economy can turn things in the cold palace into something familiar, lively, and booming.

"One," "ten," "hundred," "thousand," "ten thousand," "hundred million," "trillion," "jing," "gai" - these numbers were roughly established. The first stage, from "one" to "ten thousand," are familiar numbers (practical). The second stage, from "hundred million" to "gai," are unfamiliar numbers. The first two digits of the second stage are occasionally used as special indexes ("hundreds of millions" and "trillions of people" can both vaguely refer to countless people), while "jing" and "gai" are thoroughly things in the cold palace. The use of "tens of millions" in the first stage is also half-real and half-imaginary, because tens of millions can also vaguely refer to an infinitely large number, such as "ten thousand purples and thousands of reds," "thousands of doors and ten thousand households," etc. "Hundreds of tens" and other small amounts naturally also have active uses, such as "a hundred years is hard to pass," "completely believe," etc.

The "department stores" that are popular in various cities originally meant to express that they were "all-inclusive" and "too many to count." However, I once visited a certain company and saw that the goods on the first one or two floors were more than just "hundreds" of items. The exaggerated and touted number was less than the actual number.

"Trillion" is larger than "hundred million" and should be more unfamiliar than "hundred million," but apart from the classical terms "hundreds of millions" and "trillions of people," its use in a real sense in modern times appeared earlier than the character "hundred million."

That is, the Boxer indemnity was "four hundred and fifty trillion taels," and the Sino-Japanese War indemnity was "two hundred and thirty trillion taels." In Chinese documents and reports, they were "four hundred and fifty million" and "two hundred and thirty million," but in Western texts, there was no "ten thousand" but "trillion." (International treaties, for example, are drafted in both the native language and Western languages, and French is often used as the basis).

Western numbers "one," "ten," "hundred," and "thousand" are the same as Chinese, but there is no number "ten thousand" at all. When it comes to "ten thousand," they only say "ten thousand" (The Thousand). "Four hundred and fifty million" would be too trivial to say "so many thousand thousands" in Western languages, so they say "four hundred and fifty million" (four hundred and fifty million). This Million is "million," which is exactly the same as the Chinese "trillion." Therefore, Chinese newspapers and magazines also said "four hundred and fifty trillion." Later, even "four hundred million compatriots" was said to be "four hundred trillion compatriots." Therefore, the reason why "trillion" appeared in practical use earlier than "hundred million" was not Chinese but "foreign."

Using large numbers is more economical and clearer. For example, "four hundred and fifty million" can use a plus sign (+) (four hundred million plus fifty million), and four hundred and fifty thousand can also use a multiplication sign (X) (four hundred and fifty thousand times ten thousand), which is confusing when there are many numbers. Using "trillion" does not have this problem.

The same is true of the current "hundred million." The price of a car or a house is marked at two hundred million five hundred million, which is like two hundred million plus five hundred million, or like two hundred million times five hundred million, or like two hundred million five thousand times ten thousand. It is better to say "two hundred and fifty million," and to simplify it further, "two and a half hundred million" will also work.

Chinese and Western numbers have the same characters but different interpretations, with accidental coincidences.

In Chinese, the real number "trillion" is a multiple that progresses from "one, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred million." In general terms, "trillions of people" refers to the countless number of people (such as "trillions of people rejoicing" means "all people are happy"; "governing hundreds of millions of people" means "governing all people"). The Western Million is also the same. In real numbers, it is Ten hundred thousand, and it also refers to The mass of common people, that is, "trillions of people."

The Chinese "hundred million, trillion, jing, gai" has two interpretations: "ten times one" and "ten thousand times one." The former follows the multiple of "one to ten thousand," progressing by ten times each time, so "ten thousand is hundred million, ten hundred million is trillion, ten trillion is jing, ten jing is gai." This is called the "decimal system." Saying "four hundred million compatriots" as "four hundred trillion" is this interpretation. If interpreted according to the current character "hundred million," saying "four hundred million" as "four hundred hundred million" would only be "four hundred thousand!" The difference is too great. The latter starts from "ten thousand," changing the "ten hundred million progress" to "ten thousand times progress," so "ten thousand ten thousand is hundred million," "ten thousand hundred million is trillion," "ten thousand trillion is jing," "ten thousand jing is gai." This is the "hundred million" currently used, the "large number system."

Westerners also have two interpretations of Billion. The United States and France use "thousand" and multiply it by a thousand (a thousand thousand is a million; a thousand million is a billion); while the United Kingdom multiplies "trillion" by a trillion (a million million is a billion). Therefore, when the numbers are extremely large, the multiples are different, just as the Chinese "ten times ten thousand hundred million" and "ten thousand hundred million ten thousand hundred million" are different.
